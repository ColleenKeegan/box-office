Twentysomething friends and co-workers in Nablus Said (Kais Nashef) and Khaled (Ali Suliman) are also members of an unnamed terrorist organisation that has just appointed them to a suicide operation in Tel Aviv - a seemingly straightforward mission that will make several unexpected reversals by the end of Paradise Now which was shot on location in the West Bank under semi-siege conditions (a Palestinian faction briefly kidnapped one of the crew members).Nazareth-born director Hany Abu-Assad previously depicted the tedium anger and sour hilarity of life under occupation in the fictional Ranas Wedding and the documentary Ford Transit a road(block) movie about a West Bank taxi driver and his rotating cast of voluble passengers who muse on suicide-bomber psychology and the culture of victimhood. Such issues are front and centre in Paradise Now which folds in elements of treatise melodrama blackest comedy and a hint of romance - the latter facilitated by the lovely Suha (Lubna Azabal) whos also the movies pacifist voice of reason. The psychoanalysis of the schematic script is too pat casting Said son of a collaborator in a semi-Oedipal drama wherein he slays the ghost of his treasonous father. Neither he not Khaled appear convincingly resolved to die for a cause or assured of any heavenly reward for their sacrifice. Still Paradise Now is commendable for seeking out nuance in a horrifying subject putting terrorist acts in sorrowful context while never making excuses for them.

"Paradise Now | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; paradise-now ) Paradise Now (France/Germany/Netherlands/Israel 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli Its a risky proposition for any artist (director author etc.) to humanize a terrorist. In an era when many things have been reduced to black-and-white the word ""terrorist"" has become synonymous with ""evil."" And evil can only be demonized. Because director Hany Abu-Assad chooses to peel away the stereotypes and look at the people who commit heinous actions he guarantees two things (1) his movie will offend a host of people and (2) its prospects of commercial success are non-existent. Some viewers will see Paradise Now as an apologia for terrorism. Those who do however arent paying attention. Abu-Assads goal is not to condone terrorist actions (in fact he goes to great pains to condemn them) but to explain why two seemingly ""ordinary"" men would be willing to sacrifice their lives in an act of mass carnage. The film offers food for thought and reminds us that in any war one who understands the mindset of his opponent gains an important tactical advantage. The carrot offered to many suicide bombers is an instant ticket to heaven. Angels will appear to escort the martyr to paradise where virgins will be awaiting him. But for the would-be bombers in Paradise Now gains in the afterlife are not the prime motivation - although theyre a pleasant fringe benefit. Said (Kais Nashef) and Khaled (Ali Suliman) long-time friends who work together as mechanics in the West Bank have precise reasons for their intended action. Khaled views it as a political statement only in death can Israelis and Arabs be equal. In life Israel is the oppressor and the Palestinians are the oppressed. Death is the great equalizer. Said has more personal reasons for his actions - a ghost from his past that haunts him. We arent given many details about the plan - only that it has taken two years to put into motion and involves the two men undergoing a transformation from scruffy to clean-shaven strapping bomb packs to their chests under suits and detonating them 15 minutes apart in crowded sections of Tel Aviv. The man behind the plan is Jamal (Amer Hlehel) although we never learn which terrorist organization he represents. The voice of conscience is Suha (Lubna Azabal) Saids ""sort of"" girlfriend. Her view is that the bombings are wrong and the only way to achieve peace is by stopping the terror. The film develops into a thriller when something goes wrong during the early stages of the plans execution. Said and Khaled become separated and Jamal is convinced that Said may be betraying the cause. Its during this section of the film (roughly the last third) that Paradise Now is at its weakest. As good as Abu-Assad is at setting up the situation presenting both sides of the issue and developing the characters he cannot generate the necessary suspense to make this a top-notch thriller. There are occasional moments of tension and the final scene despite being constrained by a sense of inevitability is effective. Paradise Now is a tough film because of what it attempts to do. Its a rare thing for a movie to present events of the Arab/Israeli struggle from the Palestinian side where terrorists are viewed as ""martyrs"" and ""freedom fighters"" instead of killers. By making Jamal a sleazy character who is on a power trip (he mouths spiritual platitudes that he obviously does not believe) and by developing Suha as a strong character Abu-Assad makes sure the movie offers balance while still achieving its aim. Even the most liberal viewers are likely to leave the theater with a deeply rooted sense of disquiet. The movie is not entirely successful - there are times when it is too talky and the ""action"" portion could have used some tightening. But for those who are willing to take cinematic risks the experience of viewing Paradise Now is not without its rewards.

Nor does it conclude with the cries and whimpers of the wounded. Instead writer-director Hany Abu-Assads story about two friends called upon to carry out a suicide bomb mission in Tel Aviv wants us to teeter on the precipice of mayhem. Such is the power and the perturbing challenge of this sensitive occasionally didactic film. Is eschewing the violent chaos of bombings in order to ponder the daily economic disaster and humiliations the perpetrators experience an ethical evasion or a good use of film as an opportunity for clearer understanding if not acceptance? To the filmmakers credit this razor-wire question will cut viewers. Said (Kais Nashef) and Khaled (Ali Suliman) are lifelong friends living in Nablus a city on the West Bank. They work at a car repair shop and hang out on a hill overlooking the town smoking a hookah. On what appears to be another day in their mildly aimless circumstances they learn they have been selected for a mission. ""Paradise Now"" follows the next 48 hours of their lives. The two spend last nights with their families who believe the two have landed coveted work permits to go to Tel Aviv. They make videos reciting their martyr statements. They arrive at the rendezvous point cleanshaven and looking like morticians in their black suits - or settlers as someone observes. The overworked plan goes awry and the two get separated. Said the son of a dead collaborator comes under suspicion. In that frantic time theyre apart the two ponder their commitment. ""If you fear death then youre already dead"" is but one of the bromides their contact Jamal spouts early on. Jamal is no ordinary villain but hes ideologically overconfident. If not for the arrival of Suha (Lubna Azabal) Khaled and Said might never have questioned their assignment. Raised and educated abroad Suha has her own ideas about liberation and activism. When she and Said meet at the auto repair shop its clear something might happen. But love is a largely inconvenient thing an opportunity to debate the Palestinian situation. ""Paradise Now"" co-written with Bero Beyer is a film of ideas. Rated PG-13 the film willfully avoids the graphically incendiary even as its protagonists are decked with explosives and rip-cord detonators. Abu-Assad makes subtle visual assertions about the rifts in the West Bank. When Khaled drives Nablus winding roads in search of Said he travels a lively city in disrepair. When the two men finally drive into Tel Aviv we see a seaside haven. Abu-Assad is careful to show us things are not so simple. The ""will they or wont they carry out the mission"" tensions make ""Paradise Now"" what Abu-Assad calls a ""thriller."" Only the movie makes clear the term doesnt describe a genre. Its a way of life.

Starring Kais Nashef Ali Suliman Lubna Azabal. Directed by Hany Abu-Assad. (In Arabic with English subtitles. PG-13. 91 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) What sort of person would strap on explosives conceal them under his jacket and catch a bus in the fervent hope of killing everyone onboard including himself? ""Paradise Now"" a compelling tightly made political thriller set in the West Bank attempts an answer by turning the camera on two Palestinian suicide bombers during what they assume to be their final 48 hours. The easy approach would be to present them as the embodiment of evil. Instead the film which unfortunately continues to be timely takes the riskier and more controversial course of attempting to humanize the pair by giving them sad histories of growing up rootless. Likable actors Kais Nashef and Ali Suliman play childhood friends Said and Khaled shown smoking their water pipes and goofing off in the inimitable aimless way young men do. They work side by side in an auto repair shop in the war-torn town of Nablus (where the film was shot at some risk to the cast and crew). An altercation with a customer ends with both getting fired shortly before theyre recruited by a Palestinian terrorist organization to carry out a suicide mission together. The details of their transformation into human time bombs have an almost documentary feel the result of extensive research that went into the screenplay. Hany Abu-Assad the gifted director and co-writer (with Bero Beyer) read Israeli official reports and transcripts of interrogations with failed suicide bombers and also interviewed family and friends of those who died. Said and Khaled unkempt and with straggly hair hardly look like themselves after theyre given army regulation buzz cuts and dark suits suitable for a funeral presumably their own. In a scene that evokes Patty Hearst as Tania Khaled is shown holding a gun like someone whos been handed his first one. Hes recording a video in which hes supposed to affirm the justness of the terrorists cause and chat up the glorious rewards awaiting him in paradise after his mission is accomplished. So-called martyr videos like his are for sale at a neighborhood video store presumably to inspire others in the West Bank. Suliman is extremely effective at communicating Khaleds jittery state during the taping. Its an indication of his uncertainty about his assignment. Said also has his doubts fueled by nascent romantic feelings for Suha (Lubna Azabal) a stunning young Palestinian whose moderate views about the Israeli conflict clearly are affecting him. Theyre ill-fated lovers like Romeo and Juliet. Azabal and Nashef with his dark sad eyes make this palpable when Said goes to Suha to say his last goodbye. Intercepted attempting to sneak into Tel Aviv Said and Khaled suddenly are left to ponder the extent to which they can alter their fate or whether as theyve been indoctrinated to believe ""its all Gods will."" Saids despair is made visible in a scene of him wiping off sweat caused by carrying such heavy explosives. The film captures the bleakness of the West Bank and more powerfully shows us lives so grim that the thought of paradise now seems enticing. -- Advisory Scenes of violence.

"Terrorist plot of Paradise doesnt push hard enough - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Terrorist plot of Paradise doesnt push hard enough By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  November 4 2005 The tension in Paradise Now"" arises not from the act of suicide bombing but from the contemplation about whether to commit it. Told from the point of view of potential perpetrators the movie wants to show how such a fraught task can give spiritual meaning to a shapeless life. Yet it doesnt take its ideas or its audience far enough. The result is a humanist potboiler.Written by director Hany Abu-Assad and Bero Beyer Paradise Now"" introduces us to Said (Kais Nashef) and Khaled (Ali Suliman) Palestinians loafing in the West Bank city of Nablus. They work in a junkyard that does auto repairs and part of their downtime includes relaxing on a hillside that overlooks the city and passing the hookah between them.Like a lot of young men all over the world Said and Khaled are looking for a purpose. They find it when theyre discreetly conscripted by an unnamed terrorist group in a plot to kill Israeli soldiers in Tel Aviv the following afternoon. This would be an act of retaliation for an earlier attack by the Israelis.Seeing in the assignment a rite a duty and an honor (both mens fathers suffered at the hands of the Israeli Army) Said and Khaled leave their families for a hideaway. They are scrubbed clean. Their bushy hair is shorn their beards shaven their cool casual clothes replaced with crisp black suits ties and white shirts. Theyre dispatched with bombs taped to their bodies. On the way to Tel Aviv the plan goes awry and the movie uses the remaining hour to carve out plot twists and cook up semi-believable reversals.Paradise Now"" produces a strange feeling of the inevitable which is how the filmmakers seem to want it. Before he leaves Said has a coffee with his widowed mother. She reads the pattern that has formed at the bottom of his empty cup and divines that he has no future. Its an obvious moment. But the observation is as much an act of unconscious political soothsaying as it is two screenwriters ham-fisted telegraphy.The film is smart to allow the characters personalities and their personal anguish to figure into the proceedings. Said is pensive while Khaled is humorously devout. They are in essence a movie duo the straight man and the goof. Both actors deftly handle the emotional wringer theyre put through. Suliman is especially surprising since he turns the fun-loving clown he plays for most of the movie on its head.He has an amusing scene in which Khaled makes a solemn video recording to be distributed after the bombing. Hes holding a script and a Kalashnikov rifle on a stage but the camera isnt recording. In another take Said and a couple of the missions organizers have a snack while they watch Khaled speechify. Its not until later that the full impact of what hes read seizes Khaled.As humorous as the scene is it suggests that the filmmakers are winking at us This is still a movie. Paradise Now"" in fact is ensnared by its movieness. The screenplay introduces such contrivances as Suha (Lubna Azabal) a woman who brings her car in for repair and winds up a potential love interest for Said. Shes from Morocco by way of France and while she doesnt know about Saids immediate plans she doesnt believe violence is really the way to peace. Shes the first character we meet passing through a checkpoint into Nablus and is the movies Westernized moral center.The obligation to entertain us crowds out a serious dramatization of the question the film wants to ask Why does a man sign up for terrorism? Were given anecdotal explanations but the filmmakers expect the political history to speak for itself. The film denies us the context necessary to draw us into Said and Khaleds decision.The pieces in Paradise Now"" fall into place too easily. In presenting characters who make arguments for and against participating in a bombing the movie feels curiously equivocal. Its too simply reasoned and too tidily made to shake you up.

With Antonio Banderas Catherine Zeta-Jones. (100 min.)""The Legend of Zorro"" starring Antonio Banderas as the masked one made me long to re-watch ""Zorro the Gay Blade"" the great spoof starring George Hamilton. In that film the Spanish accents were meant to sound deliberately fake. (Zorro kept referring to ""the people"" as ""the pipple."" ) Here even Banderas sounds like hes having a hard time sounding authentic. Catherine Zeta-Jones as Zorros swashbuckling wife Elena looks fetching but doesnt have much to do otherwise. Zorros nemesis a French aristocrat played by Rufus Sewell sports heavy eyeliner and has plans to blow up America. He seems to be under the misapprehension that Zorro is James Bond. Grade C-- Peter RainerParadise Now (PG-13)Director Hany Abu-Assad. With Kais Nashef Ali Suliman. (90 min.) Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Said (Nashef) and his friend Khaled (Suliman) are recruited as human bombs by an underground Palestinian terrorist organization in the West Bank in the intermittently powerful ""Paradise Now"" which was directed and co-written by Hany Abu-Assad. He attempts with mixed results to get inside the psyches of men who would blow themselves up for the cause. The film is better than the recent ""The War Within"" which tried for the same things but ultimately and perhaps unavoidably we are left face to face with the unknowable. Grade B+- P.R. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Still in releaseDomino (R)Director Tony Scott. With Keira Knightley Mickey Rourke Lucy Liu. (127 min.)The real-life Domino a Bounty Hunter who died in June of an apparent overdose was the daughter of actor Laurence Harvey and supermodel socialite Pauline Stone. Clearly what lured director Tony Scott who knew Domino is the massive contradiction of her life Born into the glamour of London and Beverly Hills she ended up a female Rambo. Whatever reality the actual Domino may have possessed has been sliced and diced by Scotts usual barrage of whiplash camera work and rat-a-tat editing complete with flashbacks flash forwards and flash in-betweens. Grade C-- P.R.Sex/Nudity 8 scenes including nudity and implied sex Violence 20 brutal scenes. Profanity 186 harsh expressions. Drugs 30 scenes with drinking and 28 scenes with smoking.Dreamer Inspired by a True Story (PG)Director John Gatins. With Kurt Russell Dakota Fanning. (102 min.)When racehorse Sonador breaks a leg trainer Ben Crane (Russell) sees a potential brood mare if he can at least get her well enough to walk. Weve seen it all before but this one is so well made its a sure crowd pleaser. Grade B- M.K. TerrellSex/Nudity None. Violence 2 mild scenes. Profanity 4 mild expressions. Drugs None.Elizabethtown (PG-13)Director Cameron Crowe. With Orlando Bloom Kirsten Dunst Susan Sarandon Alec Baldwin. (123 min.)Drew Baylor (Bloom) is a shoe designer whose latest botched creation about to hit the stores is poised to collapse his company. As an added bonus Drews girlfriend dumps him and he gets word that his father has suddenly died in his hometown of Elizabethtown Ky. Jetting in from the West Coast to plan the funeral he encounters a flight attendant Claire (Kirsten Dunst). Their live-wire connection continues on the ground first at a distance via marathon phone chats and then face to face for more jawboning. ""Elizabethtown"" is scaled big but the experience is curiously uninvolving. Part of the problem is that Orlando Bloom is featured almost nonstop and yet he never seems to be in the movie. Ill say one thing for ""Elizabethtown"" Like every other Crowe movie it has a very well- chosen pop/rock soundtrack. It may not be much of a movie but its a terrific concert. Grade C-- P.R.Sex/Nudity 2 scenes of innuendo and implied sex. Violence 1 scenes attempted suicide. Profanity 11 expressions some harsh. Drugs 9 scenes with drinking.The Fog (PG-13)Director Rupert Wainwright. With Tom Welling Maggie Grace. (100 min.)Ghosts hiding in a supernatural fog sail into a small Oregon town in a boat they imagine to be a clipper ship. Their mission is revenge on the descendants of four men who murdered them and used their fortune to found the town a hundred years ago. The scariest thing about this paint-by-numbers remake is that it was No. 1 at the box office last week. Grade D -M.K.T.Sex/Nudity 2 scenes including implied sex Violence 19 horror scenes. Profanity 14 expressions. Drugs 7 scenes with drinking.Innocent Voices (R)Director Luis Mandoki. With Carlos Padilla Leonor Varella Xuna Primus. (120 min.)Chava (Padilla) is an 11-year-old boy caught up in the civil war in 1980s El Salvador in ""Innocent Voices"" which is partly based on the childhood of its screenwriter Oscar Torres. As an almost daily ritual Chava and his fatherless family dodge bullets in their cardboard shack as they attempt to maintain a semblance of sanity in a village turned battlefield. The subject matter is harrowing but the treatment is slick. The actors all of whom seem too posed and pretty are not particularly accomplished and director Luis Mandoki lacks the visual imagination to bring the story to a boil. Grade B - P.R.Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (R)Director Shane Black. With Val Kilmer Robert Downey Jr. (102 min.)As a petty thief turned aspiring actor and detective in Shane Blacks raucously entertaining ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" Robert Downey Jr. is on screen almost all the time which is good news since few performers can hold the screen as well. His live-wire physicality is capable of just about anything. In his new film he uses it for comic effect; at times he is as jumpy and jerky as a cartoon character (Bugs Bunny to be exact). Black who wrote ""Lethal Weapon"" makes his directorial debut and he puts a fresh spin not only on that film but also on a whole slew of films noirs. Grade B+- Peter RainerSex/Nudity 13 scenes including nudity. Violence 20 gory scenes. Profanity 130 harsh expressions. Drugs 9 scenes with drinking. 8 scenes with smoking.Nine Lives (R)Director Rodrigo Garcia. With Glenn Close Dakota Fanning Holly Hunter. (115 min.)""Nine Lives"" written and directed by Rodrigo Garcia is something of a stunt Nine stories about nine women filmed in nine separate unbroken takes. Garcia has gone in for this sort of thing before - his last film ""Things You Can Tell Just By Looking At Her"" told five stories. The advantage of this format is that if an episode isnt working you can always wait it out until the next one comes along. The uneven ""Nine Lives"" has an impressive cast but the best section features the great Mexican actress Elpidio Carrillo as a prison inmate kept from her child. Grade B-- Peter RainerNorth Country (R)Director Niki Caro. With Charlize Theron Woody Harrelson. (126 min.)Theron plays a battered wife who fights sexual harassment at her job in the iron mines. She has her best role since ""Monster"" but overall ""North Country"" is too self-consciously scaled as an anthem for the human spirit. Grade B-- P.R.Sex/Nudity 16 scenes of innuendo and sexual harassment. Violence 8 scenes including one of rape. Profanity 76 harsh expressions. Drugs 11 scenes with smoking. 10 scenes with drinking.The Prize Winner of Defiance Ohio. (pg-13)Director Jane Anderson. With Julianne Moore Woody Harrelson Laura Dern. (99 min.)Evelyn Ryan rewrote the definition of resilience in the 50s and 60s supporting ten children and an alcoholic husband by composing jingles and 25-word essays to win hundreds of contests. Moore makes a perfect Evelyn always upbeat and Harrelson as her ineffectual husband is borderline tragic. The film veers from tongue-in-cheek documentary to gritty drama to sitcom but its true to the spirit of daughter Terrys book and of Evelyns life - lumpy but filled with expectancy of good and utterly charming. Grade B- M.K.T.Sex/Nudity None. Violence 4 scenes. Profanity 25 expressions. Drugs 8 scenes with drinking.Shopgirl (R)Director Anand Tucker. With Steve Martin Claire Danes. (104 min.)Martin plays a dotcom millionaire who successfully woos Mirabelle (Danes) a salesgirl at Saks. Whether intentionally or not Martin has given us something truly spooky A full-fledged portrait of a hollow man. Grade B - P.R.Sex/Nudity 13 frank scenes of innuendo and sex. Violence None. Profanity 9 fairly mild expressions. Drugs 3 scenes with smoking. 11 scenes with drinking.Stay (R)Director Marc Forster. With Ewan McGregor Naomi Watts. (99 min.)If youre the kind of moviegoer who likes puzzling out the plots of insoluble movies then by all means rush to see ""Stay"" a great big blurry mess starring Ewan McGregor as a psychiatrist who gets pulled into the dreamscape of his disturbed patient played by Ryan Gosling. Besides these two Naomi Watts and Bob Hoskins also make appearances - the cast if not the movie is first-rate. The director Marc Foster most recently made ""Finding Neverland"" which could also serve as the title for his new film except nothing is found and ""neverland"" is too kind a term for the chaos he flings at us. Grade C-- P.R.Sex/Nudity 2 scenes of innuendo. Violence 10 horror scenes. Profanity 28 harsh expressions. Drugs 3 scenes with smoking. 4 scenes with drinking. 1 scene with prescription drugs.

Handsomely shot in widescreen mostly on actual West Bank locations and well-played by the cast pic lays out the issues in an accessible but rather too over-correct way seemingly eager to please all parties at the expense of real passion. Still subject matter should ensure a steady fest career with some theatrical pickups especially in Europe. A general low-level intensity rather than real emotional and political fireworks mark ""Paradise Now"" recounting 27 hours in the lives of two Palestinian suicide bombers as they prep for and embark on a mission to Tel Aviv. Handsomely shot in widescreen mostly on actual West Bank locations and well-played by the cast pic lays out the issues in an accessible but rather too over-correct way seemingly eager to please all parties at the expense of real passion. Still subject matter should ensure a steady fest career with some theatrical pickups especially in Europe. Third feature by Palestinian helmer Hany Abu-Assad is curiously less involving that his breakout movie ""Ranas Wedding"" (2003) which though a romantic drama burned with a stronger fire about the inequities in Palestinians daily lives than ""Paradise.""Though it has many fine qualities ""Paradise"" feels like a victim of constant rewrites -- script dates from four years ago -- and a flattening effect of Euro involvement in the production. Anyone expecting a gritty impassioned insight into the psychology of suicide bombers will come away disappointed; general auds may be better pleased. Attractive young Arab woman Suha (Lubna Azabal) crosses an Israeli checkpoint on her way to the West Bank town of Nablus. Born in France raised in Morocco and from a well-off family Suha has a cross-tracks liking for Said (Kais Nashef) a Palestinian raised in a refugee camp. Said works at a small garage business with his pal fellow Palestinian Khaled (Ali Suliman). For Said and Khaled its just another lazy afternoon in Nablus drinking tea and smoking a nargilah on the side of a hill overlooking the town in which theyre boxed in by Israeli authorities. Until that is Jamal (Amer Hlehel) their point man for an unnamed guerrilla org takes Said aside and tells them he and Khaled have been chosen for a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv in response to the recent killing of two Arabs. For security Jamal stays at Saids side as Said returns home for what is to be his final night with his mother (vet Hiam Abbass from ""The Syrian Bride""). Said manages to sneak away in the middle of the night for a meeting with Suha which ends on an unresolved emotional note and him not letting on about his mission. The simplicity of these scenes as Said and Khaled accept the assignment with a quiet pride and serenity has a power of its own reinforced by equally spare scenes the following morning of him and Khaled being bathed purified and given a final meal by the guerrilla group. Tone is less intense than similar scenes in last years docudrama ""The Hamburg Cell"" about some of the 9/11 participants. With the addition of some humor in a sequence where the two record their final testament and are forced to do a retake when the vidcam goes on the fritz helmer seems to be making it clear that ""Paradise Now"" is pitched at a far more mainstream level that the subject would suggest. And with Suha as the voice of educated reason by an outsider the script has already started to rep various shades of opinion. Shes for a peaceful settlement of the Palestinian problem arguing theyll always be outclassed by Israeli military might. At pics midway point as the two men slip through the wire into Israeli-occupied territory things start to go wrong. Said goes temporarily AWOL and the guerrillas leader Abu-Karem (Ashraf Barhoum) threatens to abort the mission; little turns out as originally planned. Second half of the film with all its criss-crossing of the border fence and signs of wavering first by Said and then (more unbelievably) by Khaled is almost too busy for any real tension to develop. And apart from the opening scene with Suha crossing a checkpoint theres almost zero sense of working undercover or of being found out at any minute. In short pics early contained style fails to develop into anything more gripping. Still performances are fine with Nashef especially and Suliman more fitfully bringing their characters alive and rising star Azabal (so good in ""Viva Algeria"") doing her best with a schematic role. Abbass is also quietly impressive as Saids mom who may or may not have guessed her sons fate. Tech package is very good with no signs of the difficult shoot on mostly real locations (with additional shooting in Nazareth when things got too hot on the West Bank). Music would have been an assist in building more tension and emotional involvement.
