Second confession while watching ""Transformers Age of Extinction"" I felt the same kind of charge that I felt around the age of seven from the movies I loved back then. This made me wonder What powers that charge? In a word transformation. What excited me in the mid-sixties in such movies as ""The Amazing Colossal Man"" (which is still pretty amazing) and ""Earth vs. the Spider"" was the stuff of ordinary life--a man a bug a hotel room a rock song--transformed into something uncanny monstrous and dangerously extraordinary. Unfortunately I got that charge for about fifteen of the hundred-and-sixty-five minutes of ""Transformers Age of Extinction."" Most of those exemplary minutes were backloaded occurring in the course of the grand action finale in Hong Kong (no spoilers here; lets just say it has to do with magnets) so there are lots of dead stretches to account for--and most of the wonder that the movie packs has little to do with the shape-shifting creatures who are both its heroes and its villains. The Transformers themselves--the Autobots who are mankinds allies; the Decepticons our species enemies; and Galvatron an industrial Decepticon clone that turns on its masters--provide amazement of another kind an astonishment of professionalism. Michael Bay in the lamented absence of James Brown comes off as the hardest-working man in show biz. His attention to detail and obsession with quality are evident throughout the film but in an equivocal way. He oversees special effects with a discerning eye and integrates them with live action with a remarkable fluidity. He brings together a noteworthy batch of actors (including Mark Wahlberg as a freelance inventor; Nicola Peltz as his intrepid daughter; Stanley Tucci as a corporate overlord; Kelsey Grammer as a dastardly government agent; T. J. Miller as Wahlbergs buddy; and Thomas Lennon brilliantly channelling Tony Randall as the Presidents chief of staff) and gives them moments to shine. They have presence and it carries over to the C.G.I. creations on whom their attention is fixed they make the crashing and the bashing seem more or less alive. In other words Bay knows to throw the meaty cinematic bones of Tuccis arch wit and Wahlbergs insolent intensity to parents who are taking their children to the movie even as he hews the colossal robots stilted dialogue to the scale of granitic tweets. He offers a prehistoric prologue that both plays to the prepubescent balcony (what kid doesnt like dinosaurs?) and amps up the psychic stakes of the title blaming the extinction of the dinosaurs on the dastardly Decepticons he lets us know from the start that if the heroes dont save the day we too will face the same fate. In addition he really knows how to blow shit up. The scale of the destruction in Gareth Edwardss ""Godzilla"" is much greater than anything in ""Transformers Age of Extinction"" but Edwards is a moralist--he takes no pleasure in filming the destruction and conveys none. Bay has no such compunction; the massive destruction that strikes various workshops and workplaces and Hong Kong at large is depicted with a gleeful vigor that seemingly defies viewers to enjoy it even while knowing that such calamities if real would be horrific beyond measure. Its a challenge that Bay doesnt shrink from--his crime comedy ""Pain and Gain"" depended on the same double game of moral revulsion and narrative delight. Bay has the passionate integrity of a natural cynic. Hes not a sincere sentimentalist like Steven Spielberg; he has a roguish honesty that doesnt hide behind noble intentions and displays its ravenous appetites and crafty calculations openly. His entire hundred-and-sixty-five-million-dollar budget is there to be seen on the screen with the price tag showing and the expected return underneath. The two hours and forty-five minutes of ""Transformers Age of Extinction"" reveal his attention and concern with each moment crafted to hold the audience through hysterical and vulgar excess. Bay doesnt deign to extend his extraordinary control to the images; he substitutes attitude for comprehension and swagger for observation and for all his meticulous command over the movies elements of action and design performance and effect his taste is cheerfully execrable. Hes the Wes Anderson of dreck. Richard Brody began writing for The New Yorker in 1999 and has contributed articles about the directors Francois Truffaut Jean-Luc Godard and Samuel Fuller.

"This Is the End << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com  Previous Started From Yaounde Now Hes Here  Next Five Burning Questions for the World Cup Knockout Rounds Facebook Twitter Print Movies This Is the End Three apocalypse movies -- including Transformers and the movie of the summer -- and another that just feels like one by Wesley Morris on June 27 2014 The end of the world is an outdoorsy thing. The char dust and rust the expansive vacancy bald plains naked trees carless roads all that abandonment all that brown Theyre a movies surest sign that a disaster has struck. Everything looks like Henry David Thoreau with third-degree burns. Even then theres a kind of existential beauty in the desolation with time to sit and think. Snowpiercer a nearly great apocalypse-minded work of science fiction-action and the movie of the summer is indoorsy. The title refers to a speeding train that slithers -- with tremendous violence in perpetual motion -- along its track like an express snake. For 18 years the Snowpiercer has been circling a planet that global warming froze. Every year it makes a complete loop. The interiors are dank in the back brighter and airier toward the front where the engine is. Who knows how long it took to build this thing let alone furnish it? But its a marvel of production design and art direction. Once under way the fight for progression (and for progressiveness too I suppose) creates artistic suspense What will the next car look like? And will the director Bong Joon-ho use it to stage warfare comedy or both? Will he use some of these mordant tableaux as throwaway gags? The plot moves its unwashed insurgent proletariat characters from the grimy rear section toward the increasingly pristine front cars. As they shoot stab and bludgeon their way forward past the prison car and the ones with the greenhouse and the aquarium past the disco the drug den the sushi bar and the sauna past the meat locker and the kindergarten it becomes clear that the snake has eaten the end of the world (as well as the selected works of Sergei Eisenstein Terry Gilliam Charles Darwin George Orwell and Jean-Paul Sartre) and the human shit it has devoured now refuses to exit through the rectum. So to speak of course. The class metaphor is blatant yet acrobatic. ""I am the head. You are the foot. Its preordained"" says Minister Mason (Tilda Swinton) a vulgar sniveling overlord with a Scottish accent and bad hair glasses and teeth -- Margaret Thatcher in an R. Crumb dream. She says this to the filthy men and women gathered at her feet in near revolt while holding a shoe ""This is size 10 chaos"" Its quite a meta-intellectual conceit The poor and elite know which ends of the assorted metaphors they occupy. Previous attempts to capture the engine were unsuccessful. This one should go better -- the man leading it played Captain America. Chris Evans plays Curtis Everett a semireluctant revolutionary. He spends the movie in a beard heavy coat and knit hat. Youll want to accuse him of playing a hipster playing a dock worker but Evans is acting the situation which is dire. In the busy opening scenes Curtiss fellow proles -- well played by actors like Octavia Spencer Jamie Bell and as a decaying sage lovingly named Gilliam John Hurt -- check in and are consulted with. ""Is it time?"" they ask him. A plump woman named Claude (Emma Levie) dressed in yellow and with a hard childish face arrives with soldiers and orders from the front. Soon Claude is taking measure of boys and departing with two one of them Spencers. The revolt becomes in part a rescue mission. Curtis and his mob take the minister and force her to help them pass to the front. Shes just the wicked witch; they want the wizard and hes with the engine. As it happens hes played by an actor even more shamelessly hammy than Swinton. But the most wonderful discovery arrives with the opening of a morgue refrigerator. Thats a Snowpiercer prison cell where inmates sleep indefinitely. Out of one drawer rises a disheveled junkie named Namgoong (Song Kang-ho). He knows how to operate the gates between the cars. His price is the release of his rag-doll sidekick Yona (Go Ah-sung) and a steady supply of a drug called kronol stinky rocks whose stench can be addictive. These two become the source of the steerage comedy and eventually the movies soul. Bong provides enough glimpses from the windows and snatches of stories from the characters for us to understand just how impossible life is outside the train. This feels very much like an insurgency of moral principle as opposed to one of practicality. Under the circumstances death is a kind of freedom. But whats stirring about this movie is that no one wants to die. More of them might want to though if they discovered the main ingredient of the jiggling protein blocks that are the only source of food on the train. Its not what youre thinking. (Theyve been down that road too.) This actually might be worse. The script which Bong wrote with Kelly Masterson (and is adapted from a French graphic novel that began in 1982 Le Transperceneige) is full of digressions and curlicues and some obvious explanatory redundant dialogue ""Were all prisoners on this train"" someone helpfully reminds us. But in Bong it also has a filmmaker whos never running low on inventive imagery or astounding physical orchestration. The camera is nimble the editing quick. The sort of mass violence of other sagas conflicts set on both Earth and Middle-earth are resituated inside this steel can. Heretofore Bong had done amazing work with exteriors in the crime thriller Memories of Murder the peerless monster movie The Host and the grisly melodrama Mother. Each movie takes surprising advantage of outdoor space -- and the first two take inspired advantage of song. In Snowpiercer shots of the tundra feel wistful. Bong used to stage hysterics in marshes and on beaches. Now look Remembrance is the emotional engine for the characters too -- the taste of steak and cigarettes the touch of those now dead. But the thrill of the Bong Joon-ho experience comes from the deftness with which he blends tones. The train-compartment structure helps but even within cars the control of the shifts in mood is astounding; one cars chirpy satire of fascist education featuring a note-perfectly nuts Alison Pill builds into the sort of comic bloodbath that would make even Quentin Tarantino reach for a mop. American popular culture is skittish about discussing social class and even more terrified about dramatizing the outgrowths of class dissatisfaction. Its as if the haves who pump out our entertainment dont want to show human have-nots rattling their cages. Sometimes you get a thoughtful allegory like the current reincarnation of the Planet of the Apes movies or a real surprise like Captain Phillips. But the shocking achievement of a show like Orange Is the New Black is its gentle but unrelenting dramatization of class struggle even -- or perhaps especially -- in someplace like a womens prison. The inmates demand their humanity. Snowpiercer is more diagrammatic about what its up to. Its an action movie. The plot proceeds like a philosophical game. But the image of the films great unwashed swaying in unison as the train rocks along the track is a chilling one. To get a movie like this one that works near the height of summer feels good. Bong keeps his sick sideways approach to comedy yet this isnt a cheap happy movie. Its a downbeat spectacle. But very good unforgettably bizarre original filmmaking and adventurously explored ideas can leave you feeling high especially when you dont know quite how its been pulled off. Ingenuity is part of it. The rest just seems like grim magic. Its gutsy to open Snowpiercer on the same day as Transformers The Age of Extinction. Both have the force to knock you into next week. But only one can actually spell ""apocalypse."" Plus Bong Joon-ho is dramatizing an apocalypse. Michael Bay is the apocalypse. What can you do with a movie whose dialogue both sums itself up (""Dad Theres a missile in the family room"") and beats a certain kind of critic to the punch? (""Im outta ammo and outta ideas"") Extinction -- or as we should be calling this follow-up to 2011s third installment Trans4mers -- serves the requisite helping of Bay-area pornography. U.S. flags whip wag and billow. The sun sizzles in the sky like a peach on a grill. Men fill T-shirts as well as women do. And world cities are reupholstered with their own debris. It barely matters whether this movie is good or bad. Bay is now the sort of filmmaker -- the only one perhaps -- whose moviemaking goes beyond such binary banality. Hes as much a general as a director now one who has demonstrated that hes one of the last men in Hollywood who can make 165 million look like 400 million. Like the tolerably asinine Dark of the Moon which laid opulent waste to Chicago this fourth installment showcases a commitment to oblivion that takes your breath away. You feel a lot of this crashing digital metal. The sound design (reportedly featuring the input of Skrillex) and effects work are meticulous and convincing -- clever too. It takes a lot of very smart people to make these stupid epics. This time Bay and his army return to finish off Millennium Park and toy with Willis Tower. Then its off to treat Hong Kong as if it were Mosul or Fallujah but with giant robots that turn into automobiles riding robots that turn into dinosaurs. Meanwhile humans like Kelsey Grammers CIA operative and Stanley Tuccis conceited billionaire inventor are concerned with attaining more power fame and wealth. And Mark Wahlberg has a very good time running around with the two photo-shoot mannequins playing his daughter and her boyfriend working with the Autobots to stop the government and Tuccis company from destroying the planet in the name of protecting it. Bay knows the disaster-and-combat iconography hes replicating. He understands the current political events and foreign-affairs topicality in Ehren Krugers scripts for these movies whose ongoing gist concerns battling Transformer factions. Happily for Paramount theirs too is a war without end. Here we see drones cause a disaster with civilian casualties and damaged skyscrapers that snow office paper. Wahlberg and some kind of badass CIA-affiliated agent (Titus Welliver) brawl their way down one of Hong Kongs vertiginous architectural feats a mega-high-rise apartment complex structured and colored in a way that makes it seem in danger of toppling over as bodies tumble along it like Plinko chips. Bays moviemaking is appalling in the way perfume is fragrant. If you dont have a fragrance you dont have perfume. But unlike say Edge of Tomorrow which uses war to imagine a way out of hell Bay restages toy wars seemingly because he likes dominion over the violence. Tomorrow is about mastering the deadly randomness of war. A Bay action film is about mastery. There is no errant shrapnel with him. This isnt to say that theres no energy in these movies. Even at 49 Bay retains an enthusiasm for obliteration similar to what some 8-year-olds feel upon discovering that an armpit can fart too. So in addition to Transformers flying into buildings a stadium-sized spaceship sucks up then shits out everything from Hong Kong ferry boats and buildings to cars and jet propellers. The city is 426 square miles and holds more than 7 million people. At least half of them are crushed by defecated junk. You see these Transformers movies and sense that as long as the studios are turning over action and superhero franchises to geeks and hipsters and smarty-pants Bay will want to keep making these films. He knows how to orchestrate the mayhem thats now a rite of everything from Marvel sequels to Melissa McCarthy movies. He perfected that mayhem and now comedians are trying both to duplicate and mock it. Im sure for Bay this is an insult like ""Whats next Amy Schumer in Sophies Choice?"" These guys are doing bong hits. Hes power-lifting and nobody lifts more more loudly. The perverse entertainment of a Michael Bay movie comes from his sincerity. When he destroys your city your street your house he means it. This movie is as much a self-commentary on waste as Phil Lord and Chris Millers 22 Jump Street. But theres no conflict for Bay no moral or ironized ambivalence. The quotation marks that Lord and Miller hide behind? Bay would use them as talons or grappling hooks. He finds this epic waste glorious. That enormous thing that craps tonnage on innocent people? Its him. T he Rover is a break from all the concept and noise and kinesis. Haywire has already happened. A title card reports that were joining the story ""10 years after the collapse."" Indeed the landscape looks desolate even for the Australian outback where the movie was shot and set. Ive seen a lot of these movies. This is one of the very few in which you truly feel as if the living are worse off than the dead. In the opening minutes a haggard-looking hard-faced man (Guy Pearce) sits forlorn in his car with the camera watching from the passengers seat as he stiffens and flies gather around. A kind of emotional rigor mortis has set in. He exits and enters a bar and a few minutes later criminals on the run have sped off with the mans car. He slips into the car theyve abandoned and a chase picture ensues. He would really like his vehicle back. David Michod wrote and directed this movie and he supplies the same arid relentlessness that he brought to his family crime thriller Animal Kingdom. Bring water. The Rover is about the breakdown of national and civic infrastructure. Just as in Snowpiercer and the Transformers movie the military has its hand in some aspect of law enforcement and defense policy. It seems Pearces character is the last noble man alive. Then he blows someones brains out and later shares a haunted personal memory of an unpunished immoral deed. Screenwriting keeps him warily in the company of a brother of one of the thieves. The brother is a big drawling ox played by Robert Pattinson who for now might be better suited for the adventures to be had in playing brutes and head cases. Its clearly a Performance and Pattinson is so committed that Pearce nearly ruptures his absorbing stoicism to seem taken aback. The movie itself is less impressive. Its studded with fine details like the use of flies and the glum deployment of Keri Hilsons ""Pretty Girl Rock"" whose anthemic pride brings the reality of the ubiquitous ugliness into sharper scarier focus Is Keri Hilson dead too? Its the larger things that are hard to look past. If Pearce is able to drive the thieves vehicle with no problem why couldnt they? And once he catches up with them the first time why not simply explain the situation? Heres why I need my car. Oh and look Yours works. This you could argue is how far this world has devolved. Rational discourse has crumbled with it. The truth is that not addressing the matter of the cars permits Michod to make a fashionable movie in which Pearce and Pattinson go on a violent spree whose means justify the bloodshed. But the deadpan irony of the final sequence feels like the punch line of a mournful but very thin joke. Strictly speaking Third Person isnt about the end of the world. Its just made so badly that it feels as if its been pulled from a flaming emotional apocalypse. Paul Haggis wrote and directed the movie. Hes also the director of such topical self-aggrandizements as Crash In the Valley of Elah and the superbly risible The Next Three Days in which hood thugs can always be counted on to help dislodge Russell Crowe from a jam. The new movie futzes with notions of time and structure. The film opens with a writer named Michael gazing pensively at his laptop and in minutes mopes around the globe to find other characters who seem equally forlorn -- Adrien Brody staring into a shot glass of limoncello; Kim Basinger staring at a photo of a child on her phone; James Franco bewildered as to why his young son doesnt want his hands dunked in paint; Mila Kunis in a panicked state; Maria Bello approaching her swimming pool then recoiling from it. Haggiss mission as it was with Crash is to assemble a fractured portrait of loss. But its high pretensions and low stakes deny complete immersion. For more than two hours youre like Bello slowly backing away from the water. You know that the walls separating these characters will evaporate and Haggis is skilled enough to intrigue you introducing two reasonably captivating figures of desire. Olivia Wildes unstable young writer knocks on the door of Michaels (Liam Neeson) Parisian hotel room; and Moran Atias is a Roma and possible con woman who leads Brodys counterfeit businessman on a desperate chase all over Rome. Wilde has entered a place where male directors still need her to be hot but theyre letting her act too. Atias puts a beautiful-sad face and a little opera into her sexy-bag-lady part. But the movies ideas of trauma risk lust writing and talking are mostly a parade of cliches built around parental grief. Everybodys short fuse and flakiness turn exasperating. Its watching typos disappear letter by letter as the properly spelled word takes their place. Some of the people wholl like this movie will appreciate its adult seriousness. But the coincidences and confessions embarrass the people who make them just as they do in the more absurd films of the Canadian director Atom Egoyan whose work Third Person seems most possessed by. Its all in the name of producing clarity yet the artistic endeavor tying these characters together doesnt make sense with creative license or without it. Haggis is force-feeding us overwrought emotion and whimsy oil and water. It makes sense that these people all seem puzzled. Theyre pieces.

Comments (2) click to enlarge Transformers Age of Extinction Video Rated PG-13  165 minutes  2014 Prior to the inevitable 90 minutes of special-effects set pieces this fourth installment in the Transformers franchise might represent Michael Bays most mature filmmaking to date. The editing far less frantic than usual maintains a sense of spatial coherence unprecedented in his work and Mark Wahlberg the most focused and modest leading man of his generation brings a much-needed human dimension to the grandstanding visuals. Even during the digitized mayhem Bay demonstrates greater appreciation for real locations than almost any director in the Marvel Studios stable; much of the fun here comes from seeing how the filmmakers use places as varied as Monument Valley a Beijing apartment complex and Chicagos Uptown Theatre. In the end though this is still a movie about giant robots fighting each other which is to say its nearly impossible to take seriously on a narrative level. With Stanley Tucci and Kelsey Grammer.

Bush Iraq war kelsey grammer Mark Wahlberg michael bay Movies Shia LaBeouf Stanley Tucci Summer movies Tea Party Ted Cruz Transformers Transformers Age of Extinction War on Terror Entertainment News Politics News (Credit Jeff Malet maletphoto.com/Paramount Pictures) Theres a general feeling of distress and bewilderment to ""Transformers Age of Extinction"" Michael Bays latest inflated interminable and incoherent 3-D saga of robot warfare. At least some of that distress is political The ""Transformers"" franchise has gradually become alienated from its Bush-era roots in gung-ho pro-military ""Mission Accomplished"" jingoism. It now partakes of a free-floating ill-defined Ted Cruz-style paranoia that is both psychically dispirited and distressingly low in testosterone. (There are nearly no gratuitous shots of female pulchritude in this movie and the only suggestion of actual sexuality is a disturbing interspecies attempted rape.) Im halfway surprised that the script for ""Age of Extinction"" didnt drag in a Benghazi reference somehow. Maybe it did and I missed it; you cant sit through a 166-minute robot-warfare movie without occasionally slipping into a fugue state. Im going to say that again ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY-SIX MINUTES. Thats exactly one minute longer than the re-edited version of Andrei Tarkovskys medieval odyssey ""Andrei Rublev"" perhaps the most legendarily arduous art film of all time. Coincidence? I think not.If it sounds dumb to describe ""Age of Extinction"" as bewildering and pointless given that its the fourth installment in a franchise that has concocted an arcane mythological back-story out of a line of toys popular with 10-year-old boys in the 1980s all I can say is welcome to the world Bay has made where we are all measurably stupider than we were before. Also revealed on our show today The sky is blue (unless its raining) and the Catholic Church may have issues with human sexuality There are many reasons that ""Age of Extinction"" is a total mess even when we move past the fact that its a mess because its a Michael Bay movie. And although it has become patently obvious that Bay is kind of a right-winger his movies are more about servicing the stunted psychologies of teenage boys than about any coherent ideology. Believing that military hardware is awesome and blowing stuff up is even better does not really qualify as a political position.This time around Hollywoods master of excess finally seems exhausted in both formal and narrative terms by the stupefying idiocy of this franchise. If you havent been paying attention thats actually a new state of affairs You can accuse Bay of many things but never before of being bored with his own work. When you reach the decadent phase of the ""Transformers"" series which was designed in the first place as the epitome of id-fueled overkill -- my friends that is some serious decadence. Thats Louis XIV in the recliner with a pile of thong-clad honeys and five boxes of donut holes from Dunkin watching a highlight reel of Best Reality Show Catfights. Theres an entire scene in this movie in which the protagonists hide out from evil government forces and evil Decepticons and evil whoever-else by sleeping in an abandoned mid-century passenger train. During that scene I woke up enough to think Wait what? Where are these people and why are they doing this and what relevance or resonance does this have to the so-called plot? No answers.Theres an earlier scene when one shot shows us the setting sun a melting glob of orange sherbet descending behind a flat Texas landscape - one of about five ""magic moment"" sunset shots milked for nebulous non-meaning in this movie -- and then in the next shot (and for the rest of the scene) its clearly the middle of the afternoon. One of the things thats impossible to decipher about Bay is whether or not hes basically been punking us the whole time. He clearly possesses some awareness of his own tics and tricks and obsessions some meta-consciousness about the manipulative character of his work and his relationship to the audience but not enough to simply throw it all away and go study the Hindu scriptures or something. (He may make movies aimed at notional heartland teens but in real life Bay was an English major at Wesleyan and a favored student of film historian Jeanine Basinger.) So I partly suspect that hes pulling our leg in making a 165 million action spectacle that features elementary continuity errors product placement for Chinese soft drinks and a running time - did I tell you this already? - of 166 minutes at least 40 or 50 or 60 of which are not strictly necessary. OK duh I get it None of it is necessary and Bay is playing out some kind of sadomasochistic power exercise.Thing is sadomasochistic power exercises can be fun and this one is often painfully dull along the long road to the admittedly magnificent action climax when Dinobots get hatched out of the earth (dont ask) and a giant magnetized spaceship starts sucking the ships out of Hong Kongs harbor and raining them down on the city. If you want to belabor the question of Bays self-awareness some more I refer you to ""Pain amp; Gain"" his idiot-genius version of a postmodern social satire. Except wait no The last ""Transformers"" movie the massive international hit ""Dark of the Moon"" was Bays version of a postmodern art film and carries the mark of his studies with Basinger. Im not actually kidding. To amplify critic David Ehrlichs description ""Dark of the Moon"" was the meth-baby offspring of Stan Brakhage and Luis Bunuel except with giant robots and a shot of a Victorias Secret models bum as she ascends the stairs.The unhinged political paranoia I mentioned above was already present in ""Dark of the Moon"" which featured a conspiracy-theory take on the Soviet and American space programs and indeed the entire Cold War. But that films madness was thoroughgoing and enthusiastic; it was inarguably a much better movie than ""Revenge of the Fallen"" (No. 2 in the series) and it made oodles of money. It should have concluded the trilogy and provided Bay with a measure of semi-demi-vindication (which is the only kind you can get when youre him). It was the nightmarish Nietzschean fulfillment of the summer-movie aesthetic a movie that seemingly had eaten all of pop culture and vomited it back up again as shards of metal. One example It featured the real Leonard Nimoy as a robot god and also a clip from a ""Star Trek"" episode and hidden snippets of sampled Nimoy dialogue from a ""Star Trek"" movie. It was an exercise in ultimate sensual gratification that ended in the nuclear annihilation of all pleasure. It embodied every genre of film at once each contaminated by its opposite In retrospect its dopey domestic-comedy scenes showed us the twitchy spectacle of Shia LaBeouf descending into madness. He was far more disturbing in that movie than in Lars von Triers ""Nymphomaniac."" You Might Also Like But Bay of course could not stop himself from coming back to a drained well and sucking the mossy ooze from the walls. And so we get the nearly lifeless ""Age of Extinction"" which has a tenuous relationship to earlier installments and none of the same human characters. No LaBeouf and his goofy parents no Victorias Secret model no John Malkovich or John Turturro. Much of it is a tepid father-daughter farce about hapless Texas inventor Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg) and his efforts to protect the virtue of his smolderin teen offspring Tessa (Nicola Peltz). Screenwriter Ehren Kruger seems to have recycled that material from a 1961 Disney comedy and not in a good way. In between Texas sunsets Cade and Tessa and Tessas hunky Irish boyfriend Shane (Jack Reynor) of whom Dad humorously disapproves become the targets of government oppression thanks to some third-rail black-helicopter alliance between the CIA and an intergalactic bounty-hunting Transformer apparently called Lockdown who appears to have been newly cooked up for this movie.For some reason that I cant quite explain the U.S. government has broken its alliance with the Autobots (i.e. the good robots) and their benevolent leader Optimus Prime (still voiced by Peter Cullen) even though those guys saved our asses from being conquered and enslaved by the evil Decepticons who are supposedly all dead. Lockdown has come to Earth to hunt down the last surviving Autobots because um - I think because some big off-screen alien intelligence told him to but dont quote me. On the most obvious level Kruger and Bay are just rolling with the punches which is what Hollywood movies always do All of a sudden we dont trust the spy agencies or Congress or the president and we feel a little iffy about rich people in suits. So the litany of villains here includes Kelsey Grammer as a treasonous CIA director and Stanley Tucci terrifically funny as a Strangeloveian corporate scientist who longs to engineer his own Transformers. Not to mention a sinister black-ops military team that threatens to torture Cade or kill Tessa and blows up their farmhouse for no particular reason. All this is quite a turnabout for a franchise that began with hyper-patriotic swagger assuring us by way of none-too-subtle metaphor that the war on terror was awesome and that diplomacy and negotiation were for pussies. While ""Revenge of the Fallen"" explicitly depicted the Obama administration as pusillanimous appeasers the unnamed president in ""Age of Extinction"" is an ineffectual patsy controlled by outside forces hopelessly in the dark about Grammers secret dealings with Lockdown and pretty much everything else. If the overarching conspiracy theory of ""Dark of the Moon"" had a crazy Kubrickian grandeur this movie seems to have been derived from the sour and dissociated ravings of a mid-afternoon Limbaugh caller. Our own government is spying on us and corporations are evil and terror cells are everywhere and WTF I dont even recognize my own country anymore. And holy crap Benghazi. It simultaneously laments the fact that we arent an ass-kicking fascist superpower anymore and proclaims that you cant trust the government while pretending not to notice the contradiction.Even the patriotism of ""Age of Extinction"" is low-wattage and feels fake. We get ""ironic"" shots of the American flag fluttering behind Tessas face in the humid Texas breeze while the black helicopters descend on Cades farm - but this is also an outsourced movie a Chinese co-production shot partly in Hong Kong with a prominent supporting role for Chinese star Li Bingbing. (Scenes supposedly set in Beijing however were shot in Detroit which is somehow funny.) This franchise is enervated and bloated running on fumes hypocritical and openly contemptuous of its audience all of which makes it strongly resemble the modern-day American conservative movement. Despite all that or maybe because of it it will make tons of money and fuel another sequel - just in time for Ted Cruzs presidential campaign evidently - with yet another threatened after that. Its really quite sad We have lost our faith in giant robots and the Republican Party but we still need them around to destroy things. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

He got mocked for it. So it feels like Bay has returned to his normal beat--big robots explosions and tush shots--with a vengeance and a chip on his shoulder as if to say Fine heres nearly three hours of what you expect from me. Choke on it. The problem (or maybe its a virtue) with an uninhibited Michael Bay and Transformers Age of Extinction the fourth in the series is that despite deadening our senses with spectacle its impossible for a director this committed to visual fireworks not to pull off a megablast once in a while. The action is cut cleaner here than in any other picture Bays done. And as his king Autobot Optimus Prime (still voiced by Peter Cullen) whirls down highways in a blaze of metal or sends puny humans tumbling through the air only to be caught at the last second Bay is often coming up with genius shots perhaps at the expense of logic. We could tell you a bunch of boring plot stuff about how Shia LaBeouf is gone making way for Mark Wahlbergs struggling Texas inventor Cade Yeager a widower with a teenage daughter (Nicola Peltz much ogled by the camera). Or about how the evil CEO of an Apple-like tech giant (Stanley Tucci) has plans to make his own robots. Or that most of the destruction takes place in China a country with a financial stake in the movies bottom line. But what matters to Bay are fluttering American flags sentimental sunsets and actors rappelling across the Chicago skyline as mechanical dogs chase them. Youre either awestruck dumbstruck or just plain struck in the face.

With one glorious fell swoop this evidently slow-to-warm-up-but-eventually-wizard-like filmmaker has expunged all his previous crimes against the Transformers fan base and finally delivered them to their deservedly blissful state of Cybertronian nirvana. Like a twenty first century Jesus armed with 200 million dollars Bay has redeemed even the gravest of the sins of our childhood. Not only has he risen phoenix-like still burning yet majestic from the putrid black ashes that remained from the burning of our childhood dreams and his own reputation. Incredibly he has somehow also redeemed the once unforgivable abomination that was the ascension of Rodimus Prime. In one two and half hour expedition to the pinnacle of awesomeness he has made whole the millions of innocent hearts so cynically and selfishly broken all those years ago. Suddenly the pain and confusion that was so cruelly and needlessly inflicted upon us in 1986 can be forgotten. Even the fresher scars the proverbial salt in the wound that is the memory of the first three piles of turd rubbed onto celluloid that Bay tried to pass off as Transformers films have been forever healed. Like faithful stubborn and persistent visitors to a highly priced and extremely talented plastic surgeon we have had our scars forever erased. All those that have ever nestled into the sometimes prickly and often disappointing bosom of the Transformers geekdom go forth like pilgrims to thine local cinema. Flock now so that you all can finally revel in your long overdue and much deserved cinematic birthright a truly epic journey into the elusive and sublime joys of well thought-out and skilfully delivered Transformers fan service. This movie isnt for the hordes. It isnt for the unfortunate souls that werent brought up living and breathing robots from Cybertron. Its not for the critics. Its an expensive much belated and exclusive gift made especially just for you. An epic royally triumphant and completely kick-ass Transformers movie that respects the fan base while also creating a new folklore that not only doesnt make you want to stab yourself in the face with a rusty nail while having your eyeballs lacerated by a million paper cuts it is actually pretty awesome in its own right. A true fan will find it almost impossible not to love this film. It is simply that good. Michael Bay I never thought I would ever say this but thank you. Even the 600 million odd dollars and approximately seven and a half hours of my life you wasted setting up the story line of this movie with those first three abominations now seems like time and money well spent. For after nearly thirty long years of shattered hopes and unfulfilled expectations finally our inner 6 year olds can live the dream. Finally we can stand on the apex of the Mount Everest of 1980s nostalgia - and wholeheartedly and enthusiastically enjoy a Transformers movie for the first time - all the while being snugly wrapped in a delightful bubble of restored faith emancipation from loss and total satisfaction. Do not take heed of reviews written by people that have never transformed a toy from a robot to a car in their lives. Do not be distracted by accounts of gratuitous product placement. Worry not about a repeat of previously indecipherable shot composition and editing. Cleanse yourself of the horrible memory that is Shia LeBeouf. This film delivers much more in the way of fan service than any of the previous films. Some of it is subtle some quite overt (Galvatron transforming into a cannon and Optimus spending some time looking much like his G1 alter ego in truck form are notable examples). The movie is peppered with a lot of little touches that would probably be lost on people new to Transformers but that had me clapping the screen at stages. Some people actually applauded the movie when it ended. Its like they finally aimed it at the fan base rather than take it for granted that the fan base would go anyway and trying to make it work for everyone else. And I for one appreciated those touches as they have been sorely missing from the franchise. But regardless of whether that stuff resonates with you or not it still has a much better plot than any of the other films and importantly its a grand spectacle - almost without a doubt bigger and more outrageous than any other movie in history period. It is simply EPIC. Anyone that is a true Transformers fan obviously wants to and tries to like these movies. Three times previous to this I have failed in this task more or less and pretty much became a card carrying member of the amp;% You Michael Bay You Killed My Childhood club. Yet this time when they take it in yet another direction that is completely incongruous with the beloved and sacred G1 mythology - I totally went with them instead of fighting it. And actually it is pretty damn cool. I didnt have to try to like this movie. As a Transformers mega-geek Age of Extinction was inherently enjoyable to me in nearly every way. Plus as I said it has a lot of delicious little morsels for the old school fans that just become the cherry on top of a very sweet sundae. I am honestly and truly sorry for anyone that thinks they are a Transformers fan but that doesnt absolutely love this movie. I think it is just a horrible defect in their personality. They will never be happy unless watching the movie is a mere carbon copy of their experiences watching the G1 cartoon. Yes Michael didnt go in the direction we wanted him to at first. But where he has ended up should allow us to forgive if not forget and appreciate the unique and incredible nature of this motion picture. When we thought all hope was lost Michael Bay has given us what we have been wanting all these years. But for some their own cynicism will not allow them to celebrate the occasion. To them I say let the 6 year old inside you finally let go of all the pain and rip up your Bay Haters membership card. All the Transformers aficionados that are brow beaten dejected and void of all hope should rest assured that finally Michael Bay has miraculously managed to not completely amp;% up a Transformers film. The jaded dejected and resentful among the once wide-eyed and awestruck Transformers mega-geeks rejoice For you are the chosen ones. You are the chosen few for whom Transformers Age of Extinction wont be a loud and obnoxious destruction of two and a half perfectly good hours of your life. It will be an exhilarating deeply satisfying and ultimately spiritual experience.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Website terms of use Contact us Get listed Advertising Time Out products Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Foursquare Time Out New York Site map },http://www.timeout.com/us/film/transformers-age-of-extinction,200,transformersageofextinction4,transformersageofextinction,timeout
"Transformers Age of Extinction - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire Transformers Age of Extinction Posted by Christy Lemire on June 29 2014 61 Comments Paramount Pictures Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action language and brief innuendo. Running time 165 minutes. One and a half stars out of four. Long before Optimus Prime hoists his hulking metal frame onto the back of a giant robot dinosaur wields his mighty sword and rides valiantly away to save the planet once more ""Transformers Age of Extinction"" plays like a parody of the bloated self-important Michael Bay blockbuster. Finally with the fourth film in the epic franchise about vehicles that turn into talking robots Bay seems to recognize the innate ridiculousness of these characters this world this overblown aesthetic that is his signature. Thats not to say that its ""good"" per se. With a running time of two hours and 45 minutes ""Age of Extinction"" is butt-numbingly long and padded with hilariously obvious product placement to appeal to the widest possible international audience. (Its just two minutes shorter than ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" for a bit of perspective.) But Bay his international cast and his massive explosives team at least seem slightly more self-aware in telling this terrible tale. Actually the script from returning writer Ehren Kruger (who wrote the second and third ""Transformers"" installments) feels like two entirely separate movies slammed up against each other. The first half or so takes place in the United States -- in rural Texas and urban Chicago to be exact. The second part shifts to China for reasons that have nothing to do with narrative cohesion and everything to do with marketing. All of it is shot with the false grandeur of a Super Bowl ad for Ford F-150 trucks. Waving fields of grass nostalgia-tinged sunsets and American flags abound. Then the robots show up and everything gets blown to bits. At least you can actually see who is doing what to whom this time. So often in the ""Transformers"" series the big set pieces consist of massive twisted hunks of metal slamming into each other in indiscernible fashion -- a jumble of shiny machinery noise and destruction. The details seem finer this time and the 3-D effects often make them pop. But the story is so slapdash the characters are so shallow and the entire endeavor is so self-indulgent it all outweighs any vague sporadic pleasures. On the upside Shia LaBeouf is nowhere to be found. He never existed as far as this universe is concerned. This time Mark Wahlberg plays our reluctant hero the awesomely named Cade Yeager. The south Boston native doesnt even begin to affect a twang even though his character is a small-time inventor living on a farm in small-town Texas. Cade is the overprotective widower father of an insanely hot 17-year-old daughter named Tessa (Tara Reid look-alike Nicola Peltz) who enjoys traipsing about the property in ass-hugging Daisy Dukes and high-heeled ankle boots. She functions in the same eye-candy role as Megan Fox and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley in the previous films and is afforded about as much characterization. While helping renovate a decaying movie theater -- a once-lavish palace whose owner laments the prevalence of mindless sequels and blockbusters hardy har har -- Cade discovers a beat-up semi truck. Back home with a little elbow grease in his quaintly scruffy barn he reveals that the vehicle is the venerable Optimus Prime himself (voiced as always by the esteemed Peter Cullen with more dignity than these films deserve). Seems the Autobots the good-guy robots who were once considered loyal friends to us humans are now viewed as threats and theyve gone on the run. Kelsey Grammer plays the CIA honcho in charge of tracking down and wiping out all Autobots. (Titus Welliver is his driven and diabolical right-hand man.) A scenery-chewing Stanley Tucci plays the high-tech corporate guru whos secretly helping Grammers character; hes the private contractor whos creating a shape-shifting metal that will serve as the basis for an army of high-powered government robots. Watching these two seasoned actors spar provides some of the few genuine high points in ""Age of Extinction"" but its simultaneously depressing because they deserve such better dialogue. The set-up is an obvious metaphor about illegal immigration and post-9/11 terrorist fears - one thats quickly established in an effort to achieve relevance or gravitas or something and then just as quickly abandoned. Bay amp; Co. are more interested in blowing Cades house to smithereens during the militarys hunt for Optimus Prime. Suddenly thrust into the vortex of danger Cade must escape with Tessa and her older boyfriend Shane -- an Irish racecar driver of all things played by Jack Reynor -- in hopes of protecting Prime and his pals. (Cade hates the guy immediately but the two eventually will bond over their shared love of firearms.) Also along for the ride is Cades obligatory wise-cracking best friend (T.J. Miller) who drives around with a surfboard constantly strapped to the top of his car even though he lives in middle-of-nowhere Texas. Their quest takes them to Tuccis headquarters in Chicago -- a city that supposedly was decimated by the robot battles of the third film but the place looks just fine -- and finally China. This entire final segment of the film is astute acknowledgement of the power of the Chinese market. Its also shameless pandering to the highest degree (or the lowest depending on your viewpoint). Its not enough for Cade to stop what hes doing while being pursued through the streets of Chicago to open a Bud Light and take a satisfied swig. Its not enough for Shane to mention that hes been sponsored by Red Bull while listing the many ways in which hes right for Cades daughter. Once we arrive in China Tuccis assistant there -- played by the slinky and sophisticated Li Bingbing -- takes a long and luxurious sip of bottled water while sitting in the back of a chauffeured car. I dont read Mandarin so I dont know what brand it is but mmm-mm does it look refreshing. Then the giant robot dinosaurs arrive to provide Prime and his buddies with transportation and you realize that this ""Transformers"" perhaps even more than its predecessors was cobbled together in the minds of 8-year-olds after all.

Or are you seriously implying that the only reason she might give this awful sounding trash a bad review is because shes jealous of it somehow? Grow up. I was fed up with these shitty movies after the first one. I cant imagine anyone over the age of 12 with at least an average IQ getting catty and defensive because a writer with her own opinions didnt like the latest product placement extravaganza... I mean Michael Bay movie. Reply June 29 2014  by  Claude     And I say this as a huge Batman fan who was probably at least a bit butt-hurt that she didnt like The Dark Knight Rises but Id never slag her off or send her death threats because of it. Reply June 30 2014  by  T     This is a brilliant piece of writing regardless of whether or not the movie was any good. Perhaps Bay could take a lesson from this kind of prose and put in a good word for some decent writers and the movies might not be so pedestrian. Reply July 3 2014  by  jx     true Reply June 29 2014  by  KScott     Im surprised critics are giving these movies anything higher than zero ratings. Do you suppose that Bay might ever genuinely put effort into the story for one of these things? I mean people will see them anyway. I doubt a little creativity would hurt. (Firing the talentless Ehren Kruger would help Im sure.) Reply June 30 2014  by  Kyle     I completely agree that they need to fire Ehren Kruger. The dialogue and pacing is just utter nonsense. I love Transformers as a franchise but these movies... atrocious. I love the toys and the complexities and seeing them on the big screen but Michael Bay was a director for commercials and Ehren Kruger is a shitty writer. Hes already signed on to write for the 5th one on imdb so there goes those hopes. It disappoints me so much that Hollywood is doing this to this franchise. Transformers movies would sell regardless. It would not hurt one bit to actually try to make them good. The Transformers Prime CG tv show was excellent AND it was produced by Orci and Kurtzman who left the live action franchise. The show won multiple daytime emmys. It saddens me really... Reply July 3 2014  by  Bob     Eventually I am hoping it will catch up. They need to get rid of Bay and ask someone like Cameron Joss Whedon or Guillermo del Toro. I mean I had no vested interest in Hellboy at all but it was witty and cool. In fact it was amazing that a director could take a series like that and immerse me into it with all the weird characters and actually make it good. Cameron does amazing things with existing franchises for example Aliens. Joss Whedon has just done some insanely good story and plot developments. For example Firefly Toy Story Doll House Angel etc... The man can write an excellent story arc and knows how to develop characters. I would love a reboot where they use the iconic vehicles that they were. I mean you can update it for example you can make SoundWave a Tablet or Laptop with his minions as USB devices instead of a cassette player although the comedic value of having him a cassette player these days would be funny and having Bumblebee a modern bug instead of an old one. Although again having him as a ""classic car"" would still be a nice touch. Anyway you need to have a movie where it opens on Cybertron and you understand the relationship between the Autobots and the Decepticons. How the Autobots where the workers and the Decepticons where the military and how Megatron took over. Then you can have the remaining autobots fleeing in their ship called ""The Arc"" with the aid of Jetfire. They are pursued by the Decepticons where they board the Arc and eventually crash land on prehistoric Earth. This triggers the ""Mass Extinction"" event erupting the volcano. The Arc and the AutoBots and Decepticons wind up going offline because of that and the ship is buried in the mountain. Fast forward to today and you get the start of our human characters living their lives where everything is good. An earthquake tremor happens and a crack in the volcano appears. No eruptions however the crack opens a thermal vent which allows the ship to turn on its automation systems. During the earthquake Soundwave falls into the repair station and the ship being confused on who is who auto repairs Soundwave. Soundwave developing his character to show you that he has a ""respect and loyality"" towards megatron places him to get repaired. Megatron then orders all the Decepticons to be repaired Aka StarScrean AstroTrain etc.... Then they leave by blasting a hole creating an entrance. In MegaTrons ""superiority"" complex he claims how he will make Earth their slave as they harvest Energon from Earth. Then on the way out have Megatron kick Jetfire calling him a worthless traitor to rot and leave. Then have Megatron shoot the mountain to bury the rest of the autobots but in doing so his kick that dislodged JetFire now falls into the repair table. Jetfire then repairs Optimus and ... we know have our movie witht he Autobots protecting earth from the Decepticons. Reply August 4 2014  by  Katie     What I would like to know is this. If the movie was so bad why is it the only film to make 1 Billion dollars this year? Reply August 4 2014  by  Naga     ... because everyone saw it to make sure if it is really that bad. I believe Bay makes this for the kids (evident by the screenplay amp; dialogue)... and there is at least a billion of them out there with a kids mind amp; can afford a movie ticket. Reply October 22 2014  by  Jake     Imagine that. A movie based on kids toys being targeted towards kids. What more did you want? Seriously when is the last time you either received or less likely purchased anything that involved the Hasbro Corp? As someone who grew up with Transformer shows and toys I was disappointed with the fact that half of the ""transformers"" didnt so much transform as kind of fall apart and then reassemble into something else completely different. However Im an adult. Kids having no real understanding of the fact that they are watching a movie based on a 30 year old tv show are not about to start thinking ""You know what? That camaros hood wouldnt look like that if it was on an 18 tall walking robot."". They are busy thinking ""Oh cool Look at the yellow robot"". To start trashing Michael Bay because you think you would have done something differently basically shows that you havent a clue. The man put out a movie that is considered a box-office smash. I for one seldom have any desire to see movies that are awarded that title. Theyre generally mentally devoid. Then again sometimes its nice to kinda flatline for a while and just watch the little one sitting next to you light up with excitement. In short the movie was made for kids. If youre an adult and were truly entertained try to not color outside the lines and wipe off your chin. September 19 2014  by  James     The reason it made a billion dollars is because they cleverly power marketed this film in ASIA which had billions of potential movie watchers. This movie did ""ok"" within our Nation. Nothing ground breaking. However in China (especially)... it raked an astounding amount of money. In fact... other movie companies are now starting to power market their films in ASIA now. There was another film that recently raked in 1 billion dollars... I forgot which one it was..but apparently also made its big money in ASIA. Thats multiple countries with billions of people. Reply June 29 2014  by  Rob     So right. Crappy humor and dialogue. Explosions galore. It truly was michael bay doing a parody of all his other movies. Reply June 29 2014  by  James Nichols     Well written and possibly more entertaining that the movie it reviewed. Regards James Reply June 29 2014  by  Harry     Im just glad they didnt let Bay anywhere near Godzilla 2014. He would of made Emmerich look like Martin Scorsese. Michael Bay is the worst director in the history of the motion picture industry. No amount of money or CGI is going to change that and what is Micheal Bays obsession with the leg pan? Those extended creep shots of girls legs are kinda creepy and he does them in every movie. Michael Bay is a strange confused man who makes awful awful movies that make a billion dollars for some reason nobody is able to figure out. Directors like Bay and Emmirech just wont got away. They linger like a fart in a mitten and stink the place up with there crappy movies. Reply June 29 2014  by  dave     I enjoyed the movie. There was cohesion between the US and China portions of the movie. I just saw the gross for the weekend. Not bad for your poor rating. Why should we read and listen to your reviews in the future? Pretend you are a normal human being just going to the movies for enjoyment. Reply June 29 2014  by  Claude     We can all point to movies we loved that didnt do well at the box office and movies we loathed that inexplicably were big hits. So pointing to a critically reviled movie and saying ""See it must be good it made a lot of money"" is specious reasoning at best and willfully obtuse at worst. And telling someone who disagrees with you about a movie to ""pretend to be a normal human being"" is just asinine. Reply October 2 2014  by  cleo     No its called go into it and try to not look for whats wrong thats what ""pretend your a normal human being"" but obviously you cant even do that. Reply September 19 2014  by  James     Speak for yourself. Her review was spot on regardless of box office rake ins. The only reason this pile of trash made so much money was because it was power marketed in Asia considering parts of it was filmed in China...being a country with BILLIONS of potential watchers. Here in America though...it made a standard. The wave lengths are obviously different and far easier to entertain and satisfy in other countries. A lot of us here want a little more quality not just in the visual aspects. Reply June 29 2014  by  James     Agreed. The movie sucked. Bay sold out to China and for a bunch of ad placements. Nevertheless people will still flock to watch this mindless flick even though its just to see how bad it is. Reply June 30 2014  by  Anneleisa     Any fan of this series will appreciate this movie and what they have done to appeal to a international audience. You make it sound like we should be ashamed of the fact the made it an international movie? Fans of Transformers have no boundaries. You sound so ignorant even saying Bay ""sold out to Chinese interest."" absurd. Its ignorant statements from people like you that give bigotry a new face. Grow up and own your mind. This movie is the future for what REAL Hollywood blockbusters will look like. They will appeal to all colors creeds genders sexual orientation and race. Get with the program or get left behind. Reply September 19 2014  by  James     He DID sell out to China. Bay doesnt give a crap about you LOL.. He wants your MONEY. Nothing more nothing less. He knows these movies are crap. He only said so himself on his OWN website. He had to figure out a way to make sure this film would succeed and writing a good story would not be possible with him holding the ropes. So power market the film to China a country with billions of potential watchers. I sound like a broken record player. Do a little research. Thats all it takes. Its business big boy. Bay knows how to play it right. Even if the movie is indeed terrible. Which it is. Reply October 2 2014  by  cleo     Haha you make it sound like Bay is the only director ever to not care about YOU and just want your MONEY and to SELL OUT to CHINA. Reply June 29 2014  by  Jack Morrison     In all honesty I believe this film was harshly judged and not just by you. Im not singling out anyone in particular. I dont see what the problem with product placement is. Nobodys forcing you to take out your wallet and buy whatever has a quick cameo in the film. I think the main issue with why this movie is hated was the run time. If you ignore everything else Im sure people would still have a problem with the run time. Its okay to have a long movie. I think it really depends on if action is your thing. And I cant complain. Even if it is long it cant hurt to at least make an attempt to not be pessimistic in the presence of Michael Bays name in the credits. Instead we could say we got two times our moneys worth seeing how this is almost two-times the length of an average movie. There was a little change up here and there than just basic explosions we expect to see from Bay. Optimus being stabbed by his own sword Cades daughter and her boyfriend only narrowly saving Cade himself from the creator by freeing Optimus and more. And the emotions really get serious at moments when Cades daughter is caught in the net with Optimus and when Cade wishes to go back to help Optimus. And the music played in both of these scenes only made things more intense. On the other hand though I can agree that the sudden setting change was a little unnecessary but would it have made sense to have another Chicago destroyed? Id at least give Bay some credit for not doing something like the Hangover Part II did in its entirety. I believe the film gives several important messages though and they are delivered quite accurately. Like most of the films in this series I believe the overall theme is that we shouldnt fear what we dont understand in this case the Autobots. The alliance with the Dinobots shows an excellent example of teamwork even though the Autobots already do a good job of that on their own let alone Mark and the gang fixing Optimus to begin the adventure. And of course the relationship between Cade his daughter and many others somewhat gives the message that theres nothing more powerful than the bond that brings a family together. In short this film has several messages that arent given directly but can often be up to the viewers imagination. For the record I think it would be wise to at least ignore Bays name is in the credits to avoid being quick to judge just because hes had a few bad movies. Im sure Stephen Speilburg and even Christopher Nolan had a bad movie at one point or another. Reply June 30 2014  by  Michael     2 times 1.5 is still a 3 out of 4 star film. Quality over quantity.

Reply August 27 2015  by  Anthony Gosselin     I know Im really late on this but the reason that product placement is a bad thing is because it ruins whatever experience viewers may have gotten from the film by indiscreetly cramming advertisements into a film. For a more compact example of how startling and noticeable product placement can be when it jams itself into the middle of things look at Nicki Minajs ""Anaconda"" video and take note of how out of place the featured objects feel.

Regardless of the motivation. The Raid wasnt created to win an Oscar Neither was the new Xmen movie or he Capt America one. Chasing an Oscar isnt the sole reason to at least try to make a good movie. At this point the TF series is bulletproof they will make money no matter what. So would it hurt Bay to at least try to and make the movie good? Its not like a good writer cost more than a bad one and I am sure the guy who has written 3 terrible TF movies in a row is not given a small check for his effort. Its like Bay basically is only fueled by his gigantic ego and demonstrates the key difference between pride and ego. Pride would fuel him to prove ""the people that love to hate him"" [Actually id like to take a time out to address this little comment. People who love movies probably love hating a man who seems to love making bad movies. Like if I were a vegetarian and someone kept making these massive chain of salad shops but all the salads had meat in them and like you couldt not get the salad without meat. Id hate that guy too. Its not like they hate him for his awesome head of hair or something. They hate his work which is terrible...or at the very least has become terrible in the second half of his career.] Back to the topic of his ego. His ego drives him to actually want to spite everyone. This is the terrible film makers defense. When like hacks like George Lucas or Uwe Boll defend their movies. Nothing in the series has evolved or grow or actually get better. They just get longer runtimes and more advertising placements. Bay just sits on his piles of money showing his critics he can shart anything on to film then have his CGI team do their magic and just sit back and roll in the dough. Money is his sole justification at this point. We know have nearly 10 hours of Transformers cinema....equal to a season of Game of Thrones. In all that time not one memorial scene comes to mind. Other than terrible ones like Autobot heaven or giant robot balls. I mean its reaching a point where its almost like his goal is to make bad movies on purpose. I am not sure how anyone can innocently make 10 hours of bad movies with an unlimited budget and crackerjack SFX team and 30 years of characters and strorylines to mine for inspiration. All that can be said is the writer from the last three terrible movies has signed on to do the 5th. This movie has a 17% rating on RT...what possible reasoning can they actually use to keep using him other than to show theyre staying the course with this trainwreck of a franchise. Reply June 30 2014  by  Anneleisa     I agree. Anyone who is a fan of transformers series will love this movie. Product placements and all. The acting was as good of not better than the first transformer movie. It was long but the story made sense.

One thing that perplexes me is why do fans who get upset with this mans creations continue to pay their hard earned dollars to watch his movies? Considering how successful his movies are one can only conclude that his approach of appealing to the lowest common denominator is paying off.

This movie is full of holes. This movie is also full of Bay. This movie is STILL like it or not a MONUMENTAL on screen accomplishment by huge teams of very very talented people. Why is this always forgotten or not mentioned? Why is product placement not seen as a financier of a film and advertisement is a dwindling DVR viewership. Why is that SELLING OUT? Im shocked at the immaturity. ""Christy"" and the boundaries of her talents seem to lay in a blog registered to rotten tomatoes and some writing skills. The question is are half of these critics actually qualified to be a critic of a film? I guess not as we dont know what qualifications it takes. I would say ""not much"" Christy and so many others simply have found a medium to transmit opinion. Fact based or not. Simply and opinion. We do know however what qualifications it takes to make a movie Michael bay and his team love him or hate him and certainly qualified. I too came out of the theatre with more questions than answers. I too came out of the theatre bludgeoned by so many fight scenes and an endless timeline. I too found holes and hated the silly jokes. I however still respect I still respect talent and team work I still respect money and business. I still respect effort. I dont respect trumped up bloggers who enjoy the sounds of their own voices a little too much. PS the movie shifted to china because that is the worlds most populated area.

It is funny how we are so quick to bash people down when it comes to watching movies when I know if you may not come out with a better story line that everybody may enjoy. These movies are based off of a kids animated TV series but brought into real life films. It seems like we are trying to make something like Transformers become reality as if it is a true thing... This is fantasy and so what if the film jumps around not making complete sense with what is going on... it is a movie you want real life stuff then stop watching these movies... Reply July 6 2014  by  Nathan T. Rhodes     Do not listen to the detractors for nothing on Earth will ever satisfy your inner Transformers geek more than witnessing the utter complete and total redemption of Michael Bay. With one glorious fell swoop this evidently slow-to-warm-up-but-eventually-wizard-like filmmaker has expunged all his previous crimes against the Transformers fan base and finally delivered them to their deservedly blissful state of Cybertronian nirvana. Like a twenty first century Jesus armed with 200 million dollars Bay has redeemed even the gravest of the sins of our childhood. Not only has he risen phoenix-like still burning yet majestic from the putrid black ashes that remained from the burning of our childhood dreams and his own reputation. Incredibly he has somehow also redeemed the once unforgivable abomination that was the ascension of Rodimus Prime. In one two and half hour expedition to the pinnacle of awesomeness he has made whole the millions of innocent hearts so cynically and selfishly broken all those years ago. Suddenly the pain and confusion that was so cruelly and needlessly inflicted upon us in 1986 can be forgotten. Even the fresher scars the proverbial salt in the wound that is the memory of the first three piles of turd rubbed onto celluloid that Bay tried to pass off as Transformers films have been forever healed. Like faithful stubborn and persistent visitors to a highly priced and extremely talented plastic surgeon we have had our scars forever erased. All those that have ever nestled into the sometimes prickly and often disappointing bosom of the Transformers geekdom go forth like pilgrims to thine local cinema. Flock now so that you all can finally revel in your long overdue and much deserved cinematic birthright a truly epic journey into the elusive and sublime joys of well thought-out and skilfully delivered Transformers fan service. This movie isnt for the hordes. It isnt for the unfortunate souls that werent brought up living and breathing robots from Cybertron. Its not for the critics. Its an expensive much belated and exclusive gift made especially just for you. An epic royally triumphant and completely kick-ass Transformers movie that respects the fan base while also creating a new folklore that not only doesnt make you want to stab yourself in the face with a rusty nail while having your eyeballs lacerated by a million paper cuts it is actually pretty awesome in its own right. A true fan will find it almost impossible not to love this film. It is simply that good. Michael Bay I never thought I would ever say this but thank you. Even the 600 million odd dollars and approximately seven and a half hours of my life you wasted setting up the story line of this movie with those first three abominations now seems like time and money well spent. For after nearly thirty long years of shattered hopes and unfulfilled expectations finally our inner 6 year olds can live the dream. Finally we can stand on the apex of the Mount Everest of 1980s nostalgia - and wholeheartedly and enthusiastically enjoy a Transformers movie for the first time - all the while being snugly wrapped in a delightful bubble of restored faith emancipation from loss and total satisfaction. Do not take heed of reviews written by people that have never transformed a toy from a robot to a car in their lives. Do not be distracted by accounts of gratuitous product placement. Worry not about a repeat of previously indecipherable shot composition and editing. Cleanse yourself of the horrible memory that is Shia LeBeouf. This film delivers much more in the way of fan service than any of the previous films. Some of it is subtle some quite overt (Galvatron transforming into a cannon and Optimus spending some time looking much like his G1 alter ego in truck form are notable examples). The movie is peppered with a lot of little touches that would probably be lost on people new to Transformers but that had me clapping the screen at stages. Some people actually applauded the movie when it ended. Its like they finally aimed it at the fan base rather than take it for granted that the fan base would go anyway and trying to make it work for everyone else. And I for one appreciated those touches as they have been sorely missing from the franchise. But regardless of whether that stuff resonates with you or not it still has a much better plot than any of the other films and importantly its a grand spectacle - almost without a doubt bigger and more outrageous than any other movie in history period. It is simply EPIC. Anyone that is a true Transformers fan obviously wants to and tries to like these movies. Three times previous to this I have failed in this task more or less and pretty much became a card carrying member of the amp;% You Michael Bay You Killed My Childhood club. Yet this time when they take it in yet another direction that is completely incongruous with the beloved and sacred G1 mythology - I totally went with them instead of fighting it. And actually it is pretty damn cool. I didnt have to try to like this movie. As a Transformers mega-geek Age of Extinction was inherently enjoyable to me in nearly every way. Plus as I said it has a lot of delicious little morsels for the old school fans that just become the cherry on top of a very sweet sundae. I am honestly and truly sorry for anyone that thinks they are a Transformers fan but that doesnt absolutely love this movie. I think it is just a horrible defect in their personality. They will never be happy unless watching the movie is a mere carbon copy of their experiences watching the G1 cartoon. Yes Michael didnt go in the direction we wanted him to at first. But where he has ended up should allow us to forgive if not forget and appreciate the unique and incredible nature of this motion picture. When we thought all hope was lost Michael Bay has given us what we have been wanting all these years. But for some their own cynicism will not allow them to celebrate the occasion. To them I say let the 6 year old inside you finally let go of all the pain and rip up your Bay Haters membership card. All the Transformers aficionados that are brow beaten dejected and void of all hope should rest assured that finally Michael Bay has miraculously managed to not completely amp;% up a Transformers film. The jaded dejected and resentful among the once wide-eyed and awestruck Transformers mega-geeks rejoice For you are the chosen ones. You are the chosen few for whom Transformers Age of Extinction wont be a loud and obnoxious destruction of two and a half perfectly good hours of your life. It will be an exhilarating deeply satisfying and ultimately spiritual experience.

I just saw this movie and I loved it Its not meant to be intelligent its not meant to be some brilliantly written movie full of clever writing and compelling dialogue. Its Transformers. Robots smashing robots explosions and gargantuan stupidity is meant to be central. And it sure is. The visuals in this movie were awesome Getting rid of the annoying old characters was a master stroke. The action was relentless and I was having too much fun to sit there and even so much as think about product placement... This movie isnt designed for the intelligent female critic. So its a waste of time you even watched this and the took the time to write a bitter review as if you were expecting to watch some sort of wanky award winning masterpiece.

At least he didnt go around screaming like Shia Ladouchebag. Eye candy was hot but boring and useles. Boyfriend was gay and carried around a stat rape get out of jail free card..really? More proof Bay loves banging young chicks. Hes even bringing back Fox to play in TMNT.. ""want a part.. I got just the part for ya"" to summarize a quote from Jay and Silent Bob. He has no problem killing off major character transformers with no lament and creating his own Bayformers every movie. Galvatron was a complete joke. I wish they at least would have used Leanard Nimoy here instead of the lackluster sentinel prime. Also EXTREMELY LAZY WRITING for the Dinobots backstory. I have been a huge transformers collector for 20 years.. I watch the Bayformer movies I like the action but they are never worth rewatching. The stories are just horribly written inconsistent and more plot holes than bay can say Fck you Thats why. now show me the money. Reply July 10 2014  by  Frank     This part of my comment has nothing to with your review other than accuracy Wahlberg ""The south Boston native doesnt even begin to affect a twang"" is actually from Dorchester not South Boston. It may seem silly but that would be like say a native of Brooklyn was from Queens or a Manhattan native. Different place within the city there are actually no big stars from South Boston. Most actors that could be associated with South Boston like Wahlbergs (Mark or Donnie) or Affleck and Damon because of Good Will Hunting and ties to Boston are either from Dorchester(section of Boston) or Cambridge(completely different city). Boston is town with very distinct separate neighborhoods and no one claims to be from one when you are from another. Very much like NYC no one from the Bronks is claiming Queens or vise versa. Lastly its a Transformer movie you listed everything you thought was bad about it and made it sound great to a twenty something and thirty something male audience who will take anything that isnt a romcom and stuff gets blown up. Its expendables with giant dinosaur robots Think Pacific Rim meets Rambo I will pay 10-15 to see that every time. Also if they fit a bud light commercial in there as well it is not going to bother me as long as it does not go over the top where every 10 minutes I get another ad or product placement. I sit through them during a 3 hour long football game why not a few during a 3 hour long movie. especially if it means keeping down ticket prices. Whatever the studio needs to do to make money is fine as long as it does not take away from the entertainment. Reply July 14 2014  by  Eric Fagan     What a lot of people dont get is that a lot of what Transformers is is explosions and fighting. Theres not that much of a story. So I think its a little idiotic for someone to criticize Bay for overusing explosions. Yes the writing with characters could be a little bit better but as far as special effects with explosions and action what do you expect? Transformers is about two sides of transforming robots duking it out with one another so obviously there are going to be a lot of fiery explosions. Yes some are not needed but for the most part they are appropriate. All in all with the exception of the writing I think Bay as done well with this franchise. Reply July 17 2014  by  Ger     Lets start with the movie Title TRANSFORMERS...What you expect to see is that BIG ROBOTS THAT TRANSFORM and battle each other from watching the 80s cartoon that was all about it...I dont know why people expect to ""feel"" the human emotion on a movie based on ROBOTS meaning the robots are the STARS of these movies YES ITS FULL OF CGI YES IT LACKS (HUMAN) STORY but heck that IS THE TRANSFORMERS since the 80s About the product placement....THE 80s CARTOON WAS A 22 MIN TV COMMERCIAL OF TOYS AND NOBODY COMPLAINED (I loved IT) I dont why most critics claims about the lack of ""story"" and overuse of CGI effects in this movie when Gravity WAS ALL ABOUT IT and they love it (I found it boring) Reply July 18 2014  by  Doug     I agree with much of this reviews points but dont agree with the conclusion drawn from them. I think that what a lot of people dont understand including this reviewer is that the Transformers movies are based upon a childs animated show (cartoon) and as such have plots dialog etc. based upon that and directed toward their target audience - children. What I wonder is why would an adult expect any Transformers movie to have adult dialog or plot or logic? If an adult likes big budget sci-fi eye-candy filled epics developed from childrens stories or simply liked the cartoons when they were younger and think its cool to see them brought to life on the big screen with live actors and modern special effects then they will probably enjoy this movie - if they can sit through it all. Reply July 26 2014  by  Bryan     I personally enjoyed this movie and im also shocked to see all the haters out there newsflash if you dont like a franchise or are expecting a movie to b dissapointing then dont bother watching it and spare us from having to read all the negativity Reply October 22 2014  by  Jake     Though I already posted a reply above to one person who clearly doesnt get that the Transformers concept was is and always will be aimed at children I will drive home that concept further. Im going to guess that everyone writing a response to this movie is able to drink legally and from reading the posts has seen the movie. I personally didnt see the movie in the theaters. I waited until it came out for digital hd purchase and got it that way. I knew from the moment I heard about it I was going to buy it. Ive purchased the other 3 TF movies already. I watch the original show on Netflix with my 4 year old. Ive watched TF Prime with him as well. The shows were bad. They were over the top. The plot was non-existant. It was mindless drivel. I loved it. Thats right despite all of those negative comments I loved it. I was 4 when I first watched the tv show. Its engrained in me. I remember playing with the toys (I got at least 2 every Christmas and 1 on my birthday for a few years). My son is like every other little boy Ive ever encountered. He likes monster truck stuff Legos Tonka trucks superheros and transformers. I cant speak for little girls (never was one) but little boys just go for that stuff. To assume that every movie that comes out is going for an award or to comment that Michael Bay should utilize ""pride not ego"" is ludicrous. How about going for money over no money. Product placement? Ok. Porsche in Risky Business. Ferrari in Ferris Beullers Day Off. LaCoste in Revenge of the Nerds. Perrier in Caddyshack. Evian in Dazed and Confused. The list is endless. To criticize that is stupid. Would a movie with no brands that could be recognized be better? Do you think youd spend at least a few moments trying to figure out what that drink was or what did that actor just use? No its used to make it more realistic. Besides its easier to use products that are already around than it is to make up some fake product and it also helps lower the costs of making the movie which leads to....tada more money Thats why everyone who makes movies and charges for them does this. Dont be so foolish as to think that anyone in Hollywood is altruistic. On the flipside of all of my previous post I will say this about this critic. Her review was well-written and does show that she actually watched the movie. I appreciate her offering her opinion and respect what she had to say and anyone else that didnt like the movie is welcome to that opinion. Its only the reasons that have been given here that have little to no validity when looking at all of the movies that are being produced. Reply November 22 2014  by  bigsands     Enjoyed reading the review. The future of blockbuster movie lie in making film which are believable and realistic. Believable in terms of the story and characters; realistic in terms of the action. Reply June 18 2015  by  Zane     Great review movie was dreadful. Im just surprised the writer didnt include the obvious plotholes lack of research. (Be it the canon or even simple laws of physics) This movie is so laughable I am actually still currently watching it whilst my girlfriend (whom loves Transformers) is dead asleep by my side. Im not surprised by the product placement mainly because... Well honestly how could you expect them to obtain the kind of budget necessary to produce this piece of trash. I would gladly write for them even though I have absolutely zero experience in film. At least I know I would put the effort into doing some actual research. I would never pay for this movie however watching it is like watching a plane collide with a train full of fireworks. Its terrible until you see the fireworks the CGI in it is absolutely phenomenal. Though it would never be enough to save this. Ive literally read childrens books that were more planned out than this. My advice unless youre watching this drunk for free on Netflix at nine in the morning- skip it save yourself time and money. Reply June 18 2015  by  Zane     I take that back besides language and some suggestive content... The only reasons to watch this is if you are a child- or drinking at 9 in the morning and its on Netflix. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

That Id just witnessed the stupidest movie of the year; and 2. It will make a billion dollars. Did I mention its nearly three hours long? Let me be clear Im not one of those knee-jerk Michael Bay haters. Im not even against the Transformers movies. I thought the first one was kind of fun in an inane unleash-your-inner-child rock-em-sock-em way (Revenge of the Fallen and Dark of the Moon less so). But Age of Extinction is lazy hackwork. It isnt just narratively incoherent. Its one of the tackiest and crassest blockbusters Ive ever seen wasting no opportunity to shamelessly plug products such as Bud Light Chevy and Beats by Dr. Dre. It doesnt even try to conceal its cynicism. The film kicks off in the time of the dinosaurs which are shown happily roaming the earth until theyre zapped into extinction by alien spaceships hovering overhead. Unwelcome news no doubt for creationists and evolutionists alike. Cut to several millennia later and a sexy blonde scientist (hey its a Michael Bay movie what did you expect? A lab coat and a librarians bun?) arrives in the Arctic to examine the remains of a T-Rex fossilized in a mysterious outer-space element called ""Transformium."" This will become important later when a rogue CIA black-ops heavy (played by Kelsey Grammer huffing and puffing like the bastard child of Dick Cheney and Darth Vader) hatches a scheme to forge this magical metal into his own personal army of Autobot- and Decepticon-slaying robot warriors. Stanley Tucci plays his partner in crime as a billionaire tech mogul who briefly gooses the movie to life with his flustered-weasel shtick before (groan) growing a conscience. Meanwhile in Texas (helpfully labeled on screen as ""Texas USA"" for the geographically challenged) a teenage girl named Tessa (Nicola Peltz) and her cash-strapped inventor father (Mark Wahlberg) struggle to make ends meet on their ranch. The American flags billowing in the wind and the films Friday Night Lights bath of warm Lone Star state sunlight signal to us that these are good people. But Bay doesnt let that stop him from tarting up Peltz in Daisy Dukes and creepily leering at her with his camera. As for her dad well all the semaphore in the world wont help you buy Wahlberg as either a Texan or the brainiac tinkerer he plays. While rummaging for old technological flotsam in an abandoned movie theater he stumbles upon a beat-up semi truck that he takes back to his barn. While monkeying under the hood he discovers that its no truck at all. Its Optimus Prime. And hes not doing so well. Wahlberg busts out his ratchet set and nurses him back to cherry condition. Optimus is in his debt. That debt comes due almost right away when Grammers band of CIA sadists raid Wahlbergs compound looking for the Autobot leader. For their crime of aiding and abetting the intergalactic enemy Wahlberg Peltz and her boyfriend (played by the generically hunky Jack Reynor) are forced to go on the run -- first in ""Texas USA"" then in Chicago and finally in Hong Kong. This last setting seems almost exclusively designed for the films sizable audience in Asia. After all Bays not the kind of guy to leave any potential money on the table when it comes to his will to worldwide box-office power. But enough about the puny humans. You didnt come to see them. You came to see giant sentient robots smack the snot out of one another and make crap blow up. And blow up it does. For the first hour Bays baroque orgy of ear-shredding eye-dazzling destruction is impressive. Then you realize theres almost two hours left to go and the movie becomes numbing exhausting and migraine-inducing. (A great missed opportunity a scene in which one of the characters twists open a bottle of Excedrin.) Ultimately Age of Extinction is an endless barrage of nonsense and noise. You almost dont even care who wins just that it ends. Bay has said that this film will kick off a second trilogy of Transformers movies -- and I think hes serious. That means there will be (at least) two more of these things. God help us all.

"Transformers Age of Extinction reviewed? Two veterans of the Michael Bay franchise attempt to understand the confusing fourth film. Slate Sign In Sign Up We Sent Two Transformers Veterans to Age of Extinction and Even They Couldnt Understand It We Sent Two Transformers Veterans to Age of Extinction and Even They Couldnt Understand It Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 27 2014 651 PM Transformers Age of Extinction Two Slate staffers try--and fail--to explain what happens in the franchises fourth film. By John Swansburg and Forrest Wickman Mark Wahlberg as an inventor Photo by Andrew Cooper/Paramount Pictures. Two veterans of the Michael Bay Transformers movies attended Transformers Age of Extinction. Below is their attempt to sort out what they saw. Its possible there are spoilers in what follows; its also possible they have no idea what theyre talking about. Swansburg Autobots roll out Wickman Transforms into dino mode. Advertisement Swansburg Glad youre in dino mode Forrest because weve got some big questions to chew on here. So we went to see Transformers Age of Extinction last night. Wickman I know this because my 3-D headache is still receding. The terrible (and racist) Transformers Revenge of the Fallen was 150 minutes long and the interminable Transformers Dark of the Moon was 157 minutes. This movie was a torturous 165 minutes. Swansburg Yes but this one has dinosaurs And Stanley Tucci And Mark Wahlberg playing a character named Cade Yeager. Wickman I was excited for those dinosaurs. Weaponized animals seem to be the big theme of this blockbuster summer from the monkeys on horses with shotguns of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes to the gun-totin raccoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) of Guardians of the Galaxy. But can we just note that the Dinobots dont even show up until after almost the complete runtime of the movie? Advertisement Swansburg Thats a very good point. Wickman Im also not exactly sure where they came from which was confusing thing No. 37 about this movie. (I hope you will be able to address my questions about confusing things Nos. 1 through 36.) Swansburg I was astonished at how late their appearance was. They were a deus ex triceratops. When I first saw the dinos in the trailer for this movie I thought it would be more like the classic episode of the original animated series ""S.O.S. Dinobots"" which I owned on VHS as a kid. (Confession I still own it.) Swansburg So the movie opens in the Pleistocene or thereabouts. And if Im not mistaken the opening sequence posited that the dinosaur extinction was somehow related to the Transformers or their ancestors. Did you get that sense? Advertisement Wickman Yes I believe the Transformers triggered the Ice Age. Swansburg Any idea why? Wickman I believe that they were terraforming it. Or since they are Transformers thats not quite the right word. They were Transformers-forming it. Swansburg So that they could ... Advertisement Wickman Take it over for themselves? But then clearly they didnt do that because they still made room for the great descendants the Witwickys. Oh I dunno JUST CUT TO THE NEXT SCENE SWANSBURG. Swansburg OK well leave the mystery of the films strange overture unsolved. As A.O. Scott points out in his review Michael Bay is an art-house auteur who revels in ambiguity so we must learn to embrace the many shades of possible meaning in his work. Wickman Fair enough but it is not a good sign that we do not even understand the basic premise of the movie. Swansburg Not even close. Lets leave behind the dinos for now and discuss the main plot of the movie. So this movie is set a few years after the last one. Wickman ""Texas USA"" as the on-screen titles tells us lest we confuse it with the other Texases. Advertisement Thats where we meet our main (human) character. But see Im already confused again And that is because Mark Wahlberg is supposed to be playing an inventor. Swansburg Right. An inventah. Wickman Now I realize he wasnt exactly supposed to be Thomas Edison but Im also pretty sure that Wahlberg is not the guy you cast to play an expert in robotics. Swansburg That was a bit of a tough sell. A Texan inventor no less. Must be Southie Texas. Wickman Can I ask another question about our main characters? Swansburg Please. Wickman So theres his daughter who Im sure well get to in a second when the camera finishes panning up her legs. Swansburg That pan the first of many fond takes of Nicola Peltzs gams made me uncomfortable. As Cade Yeager is fond of reminding us shes underage. Wickman An entire action sequence was framed by Nicola Peltzs legs  Swansburg Lets talk about how Cade Yeager and his leggy daughter meet our old friends the Autobots. Wickman Right. They find a truck inside a movie theater of course. Swansburg Obviously. The movie theater scene was really weird. There were several possibly meta jokes about the movies that didnt really land. Could you distill a message from those musings? Wickman I could not. There was definitely a part where someone complained about how all the movies these days were sequels and remakes but it didnt seem like the makers of Transformers 4 were the butt of the joke. It felt more like we were the butt of the joke for watching. Swansburg That sounds about right. OK so the goodly Autobots Our heroes from the previous three pictures. Theyve gone into hiding. Because theyre being systematically hunted down and killed. By Frasier Crane. Wickman Yes Frasier doesnt like illegal immigrants. Swansburg He does not. Frasier runs some kind of CIA black ops group called wonderfully Cemetery Wind. Wickman And they like to wear black all the time. And sunglasses. And trench coats in the middle of the Texas USA summer. So were pretty sure theyre evil. Swansburg So theyre hunting down the Autobots in order to ... what? They want their special metal? Wickman Transformium yes for making Transformers. Though this becomes confusing later when we find out that Frasier is planning on using a Transforma-forming bomb to create an unlimited quantity of this resource. Do you have any way of resolving this? Swansburg I wish that I did Forrest. My favorite part of the Frasier plot is that it is eventually revealed that he has engaged in a prodigious amount of nefarious activity including making an obviously terrible deal with a dastardly alien robot bounty hunter and killing off several beloved Autobots and untold innocent human civilians in order to secure a job with an Apple-esque tech company that has promised him ... a ""seven-figure"" salary. Its a total Dr. Evil moment. Frasier puts the fate of his country nay the world in the balance for ... one million dollars. Like hold out for eight figures Dr. Crane Wickman We should note that this movie generally seems to have little patience for questions. When the black ops crew shows up at Mr. Cade Yeagers house he asks a pretty good question which is whether they have a warrant. Grumpy black-ops dudes response? ""My face is my warrant."" Swansburg LOL. That was the best line of the movie. My other favorite moment was when Stanley Tucci who plays a kind of evil Steve Jobs yelled ""Algorithms"" Wickman Theres a similar moment with Frasier that might be similarly instructive. Which is when one of the baddies says something like ""What about the saying The enemy of my enemy is my friend?"" And another responds ""I also have a saying I dont care."" Swansburg Lets turn to Megatron the Decepticon leader but first I need to issue a correction. I misspoke earlier. My favorite moment was when Stanley Tucci takes a glob of Transformium and in order to demonstrate its properties turns it (with his mind?) into a Beats by Dre pill speaker. A close second was the bombed-out Chinese bus with a somehow pristine advertisement for Victorias Secret painted on the front. Wickman I sincerely enjoyed the Transformer who was literally branded by Oreo. I also appreciated when Mark Wahlberg stopped in the middle of the final battle to drink a Bud Light because that battle really did need something to break it up. Swansburg That was astonishing. And I must say it did look thirst quenching. If Im ever in Hong Kong in the midst of an apocalyptic battle between Dinobots Autobots reconstituted Decepticon leaders evil CIA agents venal tech CEOs and Chinese nationals conveniently trained in kung-fu I can only hope theres a Bud Light on hand to refresh me. Wickman We should set up that final battle. It takes place in Hong Kong because ... is it just because of the box office potential? Is it because Michael Bay has already destroyed Chicago and every other major city? Swansburg What did Chicago do to Michael Bay? He never misses a chance to at the very least poke some holes in the Hancock Tower. As to the Hong Kong setting--yeah we ended up in China on the thinnest of pretenses. Megatron (or the Megatron-like robot possessed by his spirit--we havent even gotten to ""Galvatron"") wants to detonate ""the seed""--thats the name of the Transformaforming bomb--in a populous city. Wickman Oh right the most populous city. So it really was the box office thing. Though Megatron must not be up on his population statistics? Swansburg Anyway it remains populous since the good guys carry the day. Speaking of the good guys I wonder if you shared this criticism of the latest installment The Autobots have been reduced to about four in number and other than the redoubtable Optimus the Autobots are a pretty unlikable bunch--theyre either wishing death or calamity on humans jockeying for power (a very Decepticon-ish trait) or perpetrating questionable racial stereotypes--Im looking at you generically-Asian-bot. Wickman Yes Im not sure that the stereotypically Japanese Samurai-bot who offers a haiku in his very first lines was the right way to appeal to the Tokyo market. Even Optimus exit is pretty undercooked. The reasons for his leaving were very unclear to me. Its a total Poochie ending ""I have to go now. Cybertron needs me."" In fact his actual final speech is even worse less Poochie than An American Tail ""When you look at the stars think of one of them as my soul."" Swansburg That ending was amazing. Heres how I have it in my notes ""There are some things in the universe were not meant to understand. One of them is the movie you just watched. Sucker."" Wickman Before we close (at least until the next two chapters) we should talk about this movies really abhorrent sexism. In addition to the Nicola Peltz character whos basically only addressed so that other characters can point out that shes ""hot"" theyre even sexist towards the aliens Did you notice when they put a giant vagina dentata alien in the movie just to blow her away? (The line ""Take that bitch."") Swansburg That was ridiculous. And that scene in which Shia LaBeouf got drunk and started hitting on random women--oh wait that was real life. Wickman No wonder he was upset at Cabaret. He thought he was seeing Age of Extinction Swansburg I bet you Michael Bay knows all the words to ""Money."" I suppose you could say that the men dont fare much better--this is a movie in which several fine male actors are reduced to impotently attempting to get their hands on ""the seed."" ""I need that seed"" Wickman Vaginas are blown away but ""the seed"" has the force of a tactical nuke Swansburg Touche. Wickman I think its safe to say that this is one Michael Bay movie that will not be joining his others in the Criterion Collection. Top Comment My boy just got back from it.  He and three friends H-A-T-E-D it.  More... -Les Habitants Join In Swansburg OK Forrest I think its time we mosey on back to our Texas USA ranches. Wickman I will bid farewell to you in the form of my favorite Age of Extinction line which I cant believe we havent gotten to yet ""We dont have a home Dad. It blew up.""

Three-fourths of the way through the punishing 165-minute runtime - and fifteen minutes after my seatmate took off her 3-D glasses in exhaustion - my brain left my body crying out as it fled ""How could a space robot riding a fire-breathing metal T. rex be so boring?"" A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Enduring the longest loudest laziest entry in the franchise takes the Zen calm of someone who needs nothing more from a day at the movies than a jumbo popcorn. It begins with thrilling stupidity the 65-million-years-late revelation that the dinosaurs were murdered by evil cheeseburger-shaped spaceships from a civilization that built their own car-shaped society from their bones the literalization of fossil fuels. From there Age of Extinction gets even more moronic and metaphorical.The events of the third film in which Shia LaBeouf saved Chicago (fragments of it at least) from Megatron have become in this sequel Americas new 9/11. Thirteen-hundred civilians died that day a rare instance of a movie giving a body count for the usual city-destroying smash-em-ups. LaBeouf could be dead too for all we know. In his stead we have Mark Wahlberg as a single dad and small-town inventor named Cade who lives in a Disneyland version of Texas with his 17-year-old daughter Tessa (Nicola Peltz) one of those long-limbed snub-nosed Southern girls shellacked with terrible pink lipstick. Also around Cades new scrap-junk purchase a bullet-riddled 18-wheeler that just happens to be Optimus Prime in disguise hiding out from the corrupt U.S. politicians who want him dead.Film Details Transformers Age of Extinction RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time157 min. More Info Trailer Related StoriesL.A. Weekly Nabs Several Nominations in Southern California Journalism AwardsDespite the American flags that decorate everything from his barn to his welding mask Cade is less concerned with protecting his homeland from terrorist Transformers than he is with safeguarding Tessas virginity. He ""fixes"" the broken Autobot hero - odd as Optimus later proves perfectly able to regenerate his entire body even sprouting new chrome exhaust pipes - and even after that kindness causes the CIA to smash up his home and force the family to flee for their lives frequently halts the plot to keep his daughter from kissing. Pops get it together. Meanwhile Bay zooms in so tight on Peltzs booty shorts you expect Wahlberg to punch the camera. When Tessas older boyfriend Shane (Jack Reynor) a Red Bull - sponsored race car driver whips out a photocopy of a Texas statute giving him the legal okay to paw a 17-year-old girlfriend its as if Bay is extending the courts blessing to himself the audience and the extraterrestrial that wraps his 4-foot-long tongue around Peltzs thigh.Bays jailbait lust is the most honest thing in the movie which otherwise mixes lowbrow thrills with high-minded but logically nonsensical political parallels. His War on Terror allegory is just a feint at depth. When a government baddy refers to the Autobots as ""alien combatants here illegally"" were supposed to nod as if we understand the allusion.Bays fake politics mean the film cant be a romp yet talk - and lives - are cheap. Age of Extinction is reckless with casualties. Once again civilians in sedans just trying to drive home get kicked around like cans. During an urban car chase crowded by pedestrians one of the heroes - the heroes - yells in frustration ""Just run over them"" Later an enemy explains that he fights the Transformers because his sister died in Chicago but how can her death have weight when the film treats humans so disposably? And its not just the extras. When Bay offs an obnoxious character in the first act one person in the audience burst into thankful applause. But then the camera lingers over the smoking corpse as if daring us to cry.The script by Ehren Kruger isnt written so much as it is soldered. No one goes to a Transformers movie for the plot so then why overwhelm us with more than 2 1/2 hours of it especially one that doesnt even make sense? The movies crammed with useless nuts and bolts the storytelling equivalent of a mechanic who lifts the hood of your car and says ""Thats everything fix it yourself."" Not even the fights have thrills. Optimus idea of a catchphrase is the blunt ""Here I am"" A more verbose Autobot a WWII-era loudmouth voiced by John Goodman delivers such zinging one-liners as ""Take that bitch - youre dead.""

Bay can take a big Gone With the Wind sunset and make it even sunset-ier but his eternal battle scenes are still grimly monochromatic. Occasionally he gets it right. Theres a slow-motion shot in which a tire runs over a goons face so crisply that you can see the saliva hurtle from his mouth and only Bay can make a glass skyscraper shattering into shards sound like a million bucks (which it probably cost). But for a film so synthetic and expensive that it could put any insane fantasy on-screen Age of Extinction has a tawdry lack of imagination. A key plotline involves a Steve Jobs - ian engineer named Josh (Stanley Tucci) whos using the Transformers metal to create a device that could literally shape-shift into anything. With such great power at his fingertips he whips up a Beats by Dre Bluetooth speaker currently retailing for 199.95. Commercialism is to be expected in a franchise predicated on the fact that a mighty mutating space alien can think of no greater thing to be than a Chevy. Still that Josh goes on to use smelted Transformers to simply manufacture other soulless Transformers feels like a waste - especially because the premise is so silly Bay should have gone all the way and given them an evil pink Lyft mustache.Bay does brave a daring new standard in product placement. He doesnt just show a Bud Light truck - he wrecks it scatters beer bottles across the road and then has Mark pick one up and take a swig. Its so calculated it gets a knowing laugh as if the audience is relieved that at least theres one joke that doesnt insult their intelligence. Later when the robot brawl relocates to Hong Kong Bay flatters the increasingly important Chinese ticket buyers by paying them his two biggest compliments first that they have a city worth destroying and second that hell linger on their own local juice boxes and water bottles whose brand names Western viewers cant even read. Thus having fulfilled its primary obligations to commerce over creativity Transformers Age of Extinction ends the way you knew it would all along with six cornball speeches the threat of a sequel and a headache.1 Courtesy of Paramount Pictures Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

Michael Bays latest installment is ridiculous ill-humored and--at nearly three hours--the most interminable yet.

Optimus Prime and the Autobots rise to meet their most fearsome challenge yet."" Thus do press materials describe director Michael Bays Transformers Age of Extinction. Its a useful clarification of what should have been evident all along In this ruthless Hasbro toy-verse its the human characters who serve as interchangeable parts.Some confusion on this point was perhaps natural. Bay had advertised his willingness to change flavors of eye candy when he dumped Megan Fox for Rosie Huntington-Whitely after the second installment of the franchise. But as late as the third Shia LaBeouf was still clearly laboring under the delusion that he was the main character. Indeed perhaps the best thing one can say about this latest Transformers outing is that LaBeouf is not in it. The boyish zeal hed displayed in the first two movies had by the third curdled into a stew of petulant entitlement.Related Story The Unexpected Pleasures of Edge of Tomorrow So no Transformers Age of Extinction is not quite as sour and unpleasant as its immediate predecessor Transformers Dark of the Moon. And no its not quite as aggressively idiotic as the movie before that Transformers Revenge of the Fallen which may to this day stand as the clearest victory by screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman in their ongoing war against narrative coherence. But its fair to say that it gives its forbears a run for their money in both departments. A long long run in fact clocking in at nearly three hours. If it truly takes this long to save the world from the depredations of robots that turn into muscle cars it may be that the world is no longer worth saving.This time out the feisty-yet-innocent (human) hero is Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg) a single dad and the unsuccessful inventor of such ill-conceived contraptions as the ""Butler Bot"" a souped-up charcoal smoker that utterly fails in its appointed task of delivering beers to Barcaloungers. Cade lives with his 17-year-old daughter Tessa (Nicola Peltz) on a farm in Paris Texas that is perpetually on the verge of being seized by creditors. One day Cade and his friend/employee Lucas (T.J. Miller) discover a dilapidated old semi in an abandoned movie theater and decide to bring it back to the barn. (Why a movie theater? So the film can congratulate itself for self-knowledge with a characteristically lame joke about how cinema has collapsed into ""sequels and remakes all that crap."") The truck is of course chief Autobot Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen) sorely wounded after a skirmish. (The fact that it takes Cade a good while to figure out that this is no ordinary semi may help explain why he is not a more successful inventor.)Since the trashing of Chicago in the last movie the U.S. government has severed its alliance with the Autobots; worse a rogue unit within the CIA classily dubbed ""Cemetery Wind"" has been targeting them for assassination. The villainous head of the unit (Kelsey Grammer) is in cahoots with both an intergalactic mercenary Transformer named Lockdown and a billionaire industrialist (Stanley Tucci) shopping for parts to build his own Transformers. Its not long before this sundry assortment of bad guys catches wind of Optimuss presence at the Yeager homestead and paramilitary agents descend threatening to put a bullet in Tessas head if her father does not cooperate with them. Luckily Tessas secret boyfriend Shane (Jack Reynor) shows up and it just so happens that hes a professional rally-car driver. So Cade Tessa Shane and Optimus hit the road together with Lockdown and the CIA in hot pursuit.As with previous installments of the franchise ""Age of Extinction"" misses very few opportunities to be dumber than it has any need to be.I could try to unravel some more of the plot here but it is as always almost entirely beside the point. There is once again an all-powerful MacGuffin to be found this time called ""the Seed""--a sort of bomb the likes of which we learn early in the movie were used to wipe out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. This narrative development remarkably is almost entirely unrelated to the appearance in the latter part of the film of a herd of Transformers that turn into yes robot dinosaurs. (These are known in the broader Transformers canon as ""Dinobots"" though the film--no doubt recognizing just how silly that sounds--refers to them simply as ""legendary knights."") There is also inevitably a storyline involving the return of the presumed-dead Megatron although there are so many villains on offer this time around that he tends to get lost in the shuffle.As with previous installments of the franchise Transformers Age of Extinction misses very few opportunities to be dumber than it has any need to be. Noble everyman Cade infiltrates top-secret labs and interstellar dreadnoughts alike with casual ease. The high-tech federal agents who track a nondescript sedan through the crowded streets of Hong Kong by satellite nonetheless lose track of Optimus the Transformer Truck on the empty roads of rural Texas. John Goodman lends his voice to--of course--an overweight Autobot who smokes a cigar. And on and on. Dont even get me started on the discovery of the wonder metal ""transformium."" The script by Ehren Kruger is uniformly terrible and not a single member of the largely talented cast proves capable of rising above it.Given the goofiness inherent in both the premise and the particulars of the movie it shares with its immediate predecessor a strangely belligerent tone. The violence is far more brutal than necessary featuring repeated robotic impalements and amputations. And though one character chides another for his ""textbook machismo"" that is in fact the precise attitude conveyed by every male character good or bad human or Transformer in the entire film. ""Are you going to bitch out on me?"" Cade taunts his (maybe) future son-in-law Shane at one point. ""Take that you little bitch"" Goodmans robot shouts in the midst of a firefight.You feel kinship for Grammers fanatically anti-Transformer CIA agent who declares ""Our world will never be safe until theyre gone.""The female characters by contrast again exist primarily to wear tank tops and short shorts and to periodically require rescuing. (The exception is a Chinese corporate executive who in a twist no one could possibly have foreseen turns out to know kung fu.) On the upside Bays lens does not leer at his actresses nearly as lewdly as it has in some past projects presumably in recognition of the fact that his principal female protagonist is 17 years old. This is the occasion for a peculiar joke however when Tessas dad first meets her 20-year-old boyfriend Shane. Cade furious says he could have the younger man arrested only to have Shane pull from his wallet a laminated print-out of Texass ""Romeo and Juliet"" laws. The gag is moderately funny--at least by the feeble standards of the movie--but its genuinely not clear how we are supposed to feel about one of the movies heroes literally walking around with a statutory rape defense in his pocket. At least we will have ample opportunity to ponder the question on the innumerable subsequent occasions when Cade comically threatens Shane with bodily harm for sleeping with his underage daughter. In a related vein while Bay does not quite stoop to the outright minstrelsy of the second movie he flirts with the line with a tiny Autobot (voiced by Reno Wilson) prone to hilarious outbursts such as ""free at last""As for the action there is a lot of it and there are occasional moments of modest visual brilliance--as when Autobots Optimus and Bumblebee flip over a highway overpass while cradling their human charges in their arms or when a massive starship begins suctioning cars up off the streets of Hong Kong and freighters from its harbor. But these are terribly meager rewards for a movie of such punishing length and across-the-board inanity. Even Optimus Prime spends most of the film seeming grumpy and sullen complaining about how much he has done for humanity and how little hes received in return. (Its a mood with which voice actor Cullen famous for his Eeyore in the Winnie-the-Pooh movies is intimately familiar.)If all this were not sufficiently dispiriting the movie ostentatiously sets the stage for yet further sequels at least two of which are already in planning stages. Its enough to make one feel a certain kinship for Grammers fanatically anti-Transformer CIA agent who at one point declares ""Our world will never be safe until theyre gone."" He may be portrayed as a murderous thug but damned if he didnt take the words right out of my mouth.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Do our Facebook posts reflect our true personalities? Incrementally probably not. But in aggregate the things we say on social media paint a fairly accurate portrait of our inner selves. A team of University of Pennsylvania scientists is using Facebook status updates to find commonalities in the words used by different ages genders and even psyches. The so-called ""World Well-Being Project"" started as an effort to gauge happiness across various states and communities. ""Governments have an increased interest in measuring not just economic outcomes but other aspects of well-being"" said Andrew Schwartz a UPenn computer scientist who works on the project.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

I thought this 3-D Hasbro-Paramount production was better than the other three but maybe thats because Ive been pounded into submission. Who can really differentiate between these films anyway? In the end they all devolve (evolve?) into clashing clanging bots.Mark Wahlberg plays Cade Yeager a down-on-his-luck Texas inventor who buys an old pickup truck only to discover its actually Optimus Prime the leader of the Autobots. Optimus having saved the world is nevertheless perceived by Washingtons power elite as a threat. Black Ops Decepticon bounty hunters government meanies - theyre all here trying to take down the Good Guys who include not only Optimus and Co. but also Cade and his daughter (Nicola Peltz) her race-car driver boyfriend (Jack Reynor) and after a change of heart a billionaire munitions inventor played by Stanley Tucci with a gust of good humor thats like a sweet tinkle amid this films vast clangor.

PHOTOS Summer 2014 movie preview Mind you this tepid fourth installment is actually an improvement over 2011s ridiculous Dark of the Moon entry. But thats like saying the flu is better than pneumonia. Either way a high threshold for pain is required. In the plus column Shia LaBeoufs bratty suburban teen is out of the picture. Enter Mark Wahlberg a bona fide charismatic action star. Hes a near-destitute single dad named Cade Yaeger who spends his time tinkering around in his Texas garage. (Uh-huh. Wahlberg is a poor Texan name Cade. Did I mention the charisma?) He buys a broken-down truck for 150 and plans on selling the parts until . . . wait . . . the light goes on. Why its really Optimus Prime leader of the freedom-loving Autobot contingent last seen in triumph mode after the ""Battle of Chicago"" in the previous film. PHOTOS Best and worst movie remakes Yet Prime is in no mood to recap his glory. Four years have passed and now the CIA (led by Kelsey Grammers black ops leader) is hunting down all the Transformers and handing them over to a tech company megalomaniac (Stanley Tucci hamming it up). The government doesnt care if the robots are good-natured or murder-minded like the Decepticons--theyre all capable of being melted down and used for weaponry. This precious manipulative substance is called (ugh) Transformium. Almost all of this information unfolds in a mildly entertaining (if not coherent) first act. Then the shred of suspension-of-disbelief goodwill dissipates as soon as an agent (Titus Welliver) drops by Wahlbergs garage and demands to look inside. ""My face is the warrant"" he sneers with a straight face. Optimus escapes with Wahlberg his teen daughter Tessa (Nicola Peltz) and her race car driver older boyfriend (Jack Reynor) in tow and the good vs. evil war is on. And on and on and on . . . PHOTOS Mark and other celebs from Boston . . . and on. . .and on. . . and on. . . Oh my goodness make it stop. Wait why are Tessa and Optimus being pulled into a spaceship? Is chief villain Megatron still alive? Did anyone else like Wahlburgers? Do Kelsey and Camille Grammer still talk? The more the destruction piles up the easier it is to take mental tangents. Indeed only Transformers geeksters and 11-year-old boys will drool over the sight of the machinery crushing each other in an endless parade of bombastic computer-generated action sequences and pyrotechnics. (Director Michael Bay has hundreds of millions of dollars at his disposal and hes not afraid to use every cent.) When the action finally climaxes in China and Optimus unleashes the Dinobots--think robotic dinosaurs--its a mighty task to sit and be awed. Note to Bay Only movies starring Leonardo DiCaprio are allowed to run at 165 minutes. PHOTOS Shirtless hunks Instead prepare to snicker at everything from the clunky earnest dialogue (Optimus solemnly tells Cade ""Look to the stars and youll see my soul"") to the feeble attempts at humor (one of the Transformers makes a Dirty Dancing barb). Not even the appealing Wahlberg is immune from the carnage as his overprotective dad shtick grates to the extreme. There is one punch line however that elicits a hearty laugh It comes early on when a former cinema operator laments to Wahlberg about ""crap sequels and remakes."" Amen.

Example subject a 17-year-old hottie to all manner of sexual shenanigans - camera shots between her thighs guns thrust menacingly at her face monster tongues wrapped around her leg and then take the curse off it by giving us an overprotective daddy-hero (Mark Wahlberg) who tells her that her shorts are too short and shes not allowed to date let alone make out with her 20-year-old boyfriend the race car driver. But of course this film isnt about that. Its about a government effort to rid the world of illegal aliens - in this case the Transformers - while at the same time collaborating with private industry to build our own Transformers which demands a further collaboration with other Transformers which requires our heroes to find still other Transformers but look out because still other Transformers have plans of their own. But of course this film isnt about that either. Its about robots fighting robots. Bay cribs from countless sci-fi hits from Star Wars to the Alien franchise (including Prometheus) and for the first 90 minutes or so it almost feels like a movie. Unfortunately there are 75 more minutes of metal mayhem to follow. Action can be exciting. But chaos gets boring fast. 2014. -- Matthew Lickona This movie is not currently in theaters.

Dave McGinn The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Jun. 26 2014 1054AM EDT Last updated Friday Jun. 27 2014 1141AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Michael Bay Written by Ehren Kruger Starring Mark Wahlberg Nicola Peltz Jack Reynor Stanley Tucci Classification PG Genre action Year 2014 Country USA Language English Everything about Michael Bays fourth Transformers movie is too much. Its 165 minute running time. Its convoluted plot. Its deafening score. Its product placement. Its never-ending action scenes. Its swooping camera work. Its overwhelming stupidity. Well before it finished I was numb from its bludgeoning excess. The story opens five years after the ""battle of Chicago"" the CGI extravaganza that ended the third instalment. Despite the fact that the Autobots saved humanity from annihilation a C.I.A. black ops team led by Harold Attinger (Kelsey Grammer) is hunting down all Transformers Autobots or Decepticons. Citizens are being asked to report all ""suspicious"" alien activity.Shia LeBeouf is gone. In his place is Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg) a struggling robotics engineer who discovers a broken-down Optimus Prime in a rotting movie theatre where the owner bemoans all those horrible sequels that have ruined movies.Yeagers daughter Tessa (Nicola Peltz) a gorgeous blonde who spends her time at their farm in short shorts and high heels wants him to report the find but he refuses.Next thing you know the black ops team is descending on them and explosions begin.After narrowly escaping with the help of Tessas race-car driving boyfriend Optimus sends out a call to all Autobots and suddenly they all appear - Bumblebee Hound (John Goodman) Ratchet (Robert Foxworth) Brains (Reno Wilson) Crosshairs (John DiMaggio) and Drift (Ken Watanabe). The group travels to Chicago to sniff out secrets at the company run by Joshua Joyce (Stanley Tucci) a Steve Jobs-esque figure who is building ""better"" Transformers in cahoots with Attinger.Next thing you know another Transfomer appears out of a giant spaceship. Hes got a huge cannon on his face and some message about a ""Creator"" who wants Optimus for reasons that are never explained and a ""seed"" that will destroy the Earth.At this point the action moves to Hong Kong for reasons that are completely unnecessary other than satisfying the interests of the films Chinese co-financiers and raking in money from the worlds second-largest movie market. This is a movie after all designed with nothing more in mind than making cash registers ring as is evidenced by its heavy product placement. Bud Light Tom Ford Victoria Secret and Goodyear are just some of the brands that receive conspicuous screen time.And dont forget about the toys which will now include the Dinobots (Transformers in the form of dinosaurs in case you had to ask). Optimus rides one into battle a sight that is surely nothing short of awesome in the eyes of 13-year-olds.Bay is no doubt hoping those kids dont ask too many questions because once you start wondering why any of it is happening or try to make sense of all the storylines you get lost. Of course its hard to think clearly when your central nervous system is being bombarded by all these explosions and is dizzy from a camera that never stops moving.Amidst all the carnage Tucci is the only actor who rises above something other than one of Bays stock types. He goes from a wonderfully arrogant futurist to someone with fears and desires and second thoughts that actually resemble those of a human being. Wahlberg as an overprotective father has some funny banter with Peltz but otherwise he is left with dialogue that includes the line ""This alien gun can really kick ass""Screenwriter Ehren Kruger who penned the two previous Transformers movies obviously knows by now theres no point in trying for subtlety.Really why bother? The franchise so far has taken in more than 2.5-billion (U.S.) at the box office and a fifth film is already in the works.The juggernaut is only getting bigger louder longer. That may very well serve as Bays personal motto.Bay doesnt care about ideas; he only cares about serving up spectacle. As he always has in the Transformers movies however he keeps making Optimus Prime blather on about why humans are worth fighting for. (Because we have the potential for goodness. Isnt that something?).So we know why they want us. It might be time to ask why we want them.

"Transformers Age of Extinction | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; transformers-age-of-extinction ) Transformers Age of Extinction (United States 2014) June 26 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli Michael Bay has often said how he loves to ""blow things up real good."" Well if thats his desire in life theres little doubt that he tops himself in Transformers Age of Extinction. This is as excruciating a movie as is likely to be experienced by anyone anywhere. It isnt merely that the story is insulting the characters are bland the action is dull and the CGI is everywhere - its that all this goes on for nearly three hours. Thats three hours of your life youll never get back. Bays argument is that the Transformers movies are made for the little kid in all of us. That might be true assuming the kid is pugnacious antisocial afflicted with an attention span approaching zero and lacking in anything remotely resembling a creative impulse. My inner child often delights in silly loud or otherwise unsophisticated films. Parts of Godzilla gave me chills. Misgivings aside Im looking forward to the next Star Wars. And despite its recent precipitous nosedive I still adore Doctor Who. But that inner child quails at the thought of enduring even one more minute of a Transformers movie. The only thing more epic about this film than its running length is its soullessness. Bay keeps saying hes done with the Transformers franchise but it draws him back like flies to shit. This time around the human actors from the earlier films have been jettisoned. At first glance that might seem like a good thing until one realizes that people in Bay films are as interesting and important as background dA(c)cor. Its really all about the robots the orgiastic display of CGI destruction and (of course) the explosions. I wish I could say ""just sit back and enjoy the ride"" but theres a reason roller coasters are only a few minutes long. Is there a story here? Its not War and Peace but theres something that might be mistaken for the skeleton of a plot if viewed in dim light. For those who care about continuity events in Transformers Age of Extinction take place five years after those of the previous film Transformers Dark of the Moon. By this time the Transformers have been virtually eliminated from Earth as a result of a ruthless cleansing scheme spearheaded by CIA Black Ops hotshot Harold Attinger (Kelsey Grammer in full Stinky Pete mode). Attinger has help from a Decepticon called ""Lockdown"" (voice of Mark Ryan) who has come to Earth in search of Optimus Prime (voice of Peter Cullen). The CIA bad guy has also formed an alliance with billionaire inventor Joshua Joyce (Stanley Tucci) who has figured out how to build Transformers. His pilot project is something he calls ""Galvatron"" (voice of Frank Welker) - a robot that looks an awful like the dreaded (and supposedly dead) Megatron. The basic thrust of Transformers Age of Extinction follows the misadventures of four surviving Autobots - Bumblebee Hound (voice of John Goodman) Crosshairs (voice of John DiMaggio) and Drift (voice of Ken Watanabe) - as they seek out Optimus Prime who has been revived with the help of Texas mechanic Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg). Along with Cade his daughter Tessa (Nicola Peltz) and Tessas boyfriend Shane (Jack Reynor) the Autobots seek to avoid being captured or destroyed by Lockdown while possibly saving Earth from Galvatron. (Lockdown doesnt really care about humans - he just wants Optimus Prime.) Bay once again deals Chicago a gut punch but this time around he saves the real destruction for Hong Kong. In the acting department Mark Wahlberg is an upgrade on Shia Labeouf although it hardly matters. Walhberg does his job and stands around looking suitably awed angry or frightened depending on what the script requires. Somehow Stanley Tucci manages to rise above the material and leave an impression. It helps that hes used partially for comedic relief and gets to utter the best one-liner (one that uses up the movies PG-13 single ""f-word"" allowance). Tuccis success is counterbalanced by Nicola Peltzs failure. The Transformers movies have had their share of annoying characters but none (not even the one played by Megan Fox) has achieved the apex occupied by Peltzs Tessa who one-ups the worst horror movie heroine in terms of incompetence ignorance and irritation factor. On more than one occasion I was actively rooting for a robot to stomp on her or for her to fall from a great height and make a satisfying splat. I guess this could be considered a step forward for Bay - he made me feel something about a human being in a Transformers film. In the end theres a sense that nothing much happens in Transformers Age of Extinction although that ""nothing"" is long loud and flashy. Bays approach which is technically proficient but without charm or life bludgeons viewers into a near-catatonic state. If one takes a step back and looks at Transformers Age of Extinction from a distance the story isnt confusing but while watching it the sense of chaos is almost overwhelming. Shakespeare didnt know it but when he wrote of ""sound and fury signifying nothing"" he could have been describing this franchise. I understand that this is a ""fanboy"" driven production intended only to please those who either play with Transformers toys or have fond memories of doing so in their youth. However its disappointing to see how contemptuous the filmmakers are of anyone who pays good money to see a movie in the hope that it will offer more than cool special effects (that become progressively less ""cool"" the longer the film runs). This is blockbuster moviemaking at its worst - a product so cynical that it doesnt try to pretend its anything more than a mindless spectacle. Its endless tiresome and tedious but it will make so much money that Transformers 5 is a foregone conclusion. I cant think of a more compelling reason to hate Transformers Age of Extinction.

Warner Bros. Scott Bowles USA TODAY 523 p.m. EDT June 26 2014Optimus Prime returns to battle for a fourth time in ""Transformers Age of Extinction.""(Photo Industrial Light amp; Magic)Transformers Age of Extinction begins with a hint of hope as dinosaurs screech and clatter over a nascent Earth abundant with life.Alas moments later prehistoric robots wipe out the reptiles -- and any whiff of life in Michael Bays latest temple of excess and ego.Deafening deadening and about two hours too long Extinction (1/2 out of four; rated PG-13; opens in select cities Thursday and nationwide Friday) would mark the weakest installment yet of the 7-year-old Hasbro franchise -- if the previous three movies were discernible from one another.But like the toys-turned-aliens who anchor the story Transformers has never been a series capable of personality growth leaving a cast of replaceable humans pretending to crack wise with blue-screen heroes as thoughtful as pudding.REVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYMORE USA TODAYs guide to summer moviesMark Wahlberg replaces Shia LaBeouf in the series playing Cade Yeager a struggling inventor and single father who dreams of being a super-nerd living like Radio Shack royalty.While helping to rebuild a classic single-screen movie house in rural Texas Cade stumbles upon an abandoned semi-truck rig (huh?) in the decimated building. Its Bays way of paying homage to the small-town movie experience as if he didnt help to destroy it.We learn that the truck is actually Optimus Prime our baritone-voiced hero robot who was nearly destroyed in the epic Chicago battle of aliens that concluded the third film. For reasons that extend logic no further than creating plot tension humans have decided to wipe out the good robots that repelled the bad. A shadowy black ops government agency led by Harold Attinger (Kelsey Grammer) hunts Autobot heroes such as Hound (John Goodman) and Drift (Ken Watanabe).Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Mark Wahlberg replaces Shia LaBeouf as the main actor in Transformers Age of Extinction. Wahlberg plays a struggling inventor who accidentally stumbles upon Optimus Prime much to the dismay of the U.S. government. VPCNew voices dont equal new complexity however and Transformers may be the movie industrys most lucrative series in need of a makeover even one cranked out by studio machinery.Wahlberg in particular is given little to embody a robotic role desperate for a human touch. Instead he wields one-liners as if hes performing on open-mike night. Like most Bay women Cades daughter Tessa (Nicola Peltz) is asked simply to pout and wear short shorts. Her boyfriend the smug 20-year-old Shane (Jack Reynor) provides attempted comic relief explaining to dad that hes been sleeping with his daughter since she was a sophomore in high school so the statutory rape thing is cool.The movie has solid 3-D and it wouldnt be a Bay film without explosions galore.But the title to the 2-hour 37-minute picture is a cruel hoax. Transformers has no intention of going extinct not as long as 10-year-old American boys and international audiences crave empty movies that go boom. The Transformers are brilliant brave world-conquering space travelers. Time to morph into something entertaining. 139 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 11 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1vaazgJ",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/06/26/transformers-age-of-extinction-movie-review/11392785/,200,transformersageofextinction15,transformersageofextinction,usatoday
"Review In Transformers Age of Extinction things get so Bayed - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review In Transformers Age of Extinction things get Bayed -- big time Transformers Industrial Light amp; Magic / Paramount Pictures Grimlock with Optimus Prime (center) in ""Transformers Age of Extinction."" Grimlock with Optimus Prime (center) in ""Transformers Age of Extinction."" (Industrial Light amp; Magic / Paramount Pictures) Michael Bay builds a better (but not great) Transformers After nearly three hours in the crucible that is ""Transformers Age of Extinction"" a sort of shorthand might be helpful to discuss the fourth edition of the ginormous action franchise ruled by the iron fist of director Michael Bay.To that end lets say ""Bayed"" as in ""being Bayed"" is the core principle at work in the films. In general being Bayed means being beaten blasted bashed crushed melted morphed reconstituted and remade over and over and over again. The term can be applied broadly starting with ""Extinctions"" greatly expanded world of Autobots Decepticons and Dinobots all of which undergo the entire regimen many times. But it is also useful in referring to the human hordes on the receiving end of much of that pounding. And I dont just mean cast members Mark Wahlberg Stanley Tucci Kelsey Grammer Nicola Peltz Jack Reynor Bingbing Li and T.J. Miller. I mean you and me brother.The film picks up four years after ""Transformers Dark of the Moon"" in which Chicago was completely Bayed and Shia LaBeoufs Sam Witwicky was left behind along with the mess. ""Extinction"" has many staging grounds and even more subplots The government has ended any Autobot-U.S. military joint operations and put a price on their metal-heads including intrepid leader Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen).

This summer box-office season has a problem that the movie industry is looking to Michael Bay and Optimus Prime to solve. So far this year no movie has broken the 100-million mark in its first three days despite big results from ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" ""Godzilla"" and ""X-Men Days of Future... (Ryan Faughnder) Theres a secret CIA unit called Cemetery Wind run by the self-righteous and sinister Harold Attinger (Grammer). His top assassin James Savoy (Titus Welliver) is hunting bots with the help of a dark metal asset named Lockdown (Mark Ryan) who spends nearly as much time fussing about Optimus Primes habit of helping humans as fighting. Jeez chill. Any spare bot parts are being fed to KSI a high-tech operation run by Joshua Joyce (Tucci). By working off of Megatrons severed head which Optimus displaced in 2011s ""Dark of the Moon"" Joyces Kinetic Solutions International has created a new-and-improved morphing metal substance called ""transformium."" Joyce is using it to make a new robot army. Bay is using it to inject a few sight gags. Its a toss-up as to which is handling transformium better.Joyce has captured and is exploiting the little jiving gizmo named Brains (Reno Wilson). As in ""Dark of the Moon"" Brains bad attitude and sarcastic riffs bring welcome comic relief. The movie could actually use more humor especially since some of the one-liners delivered by Autobot regulars like Hound (John Goodman) fall like lead. KSIs newly created Transformer Galvatron (Frank Welker) is one of the movies major headaches. Hes big hes bad hes primed to take on Prime.Meanwhile in rural Texas where the grass is always green and the corn is as high as an elephants eye (apparently Bay and screenwriter Ehren Kruger havent spent much time in Texas) widower-inventor-all-around-good-guy Cade Yeager (Wahlberg) discovers a broken-down semi that is perfect for his robotics tinkering. The junker also happens to be where a wounded Optimus Prime is hiding.Lucas (Miller) is Cades stoner-partner and clearly cant be counted on man. Teenage daughter Tessa (Peltz) is in the process of rebelling. Shes got a secret boyfriend named Shane (Reynor) a stock-car racer that Cade doesnt exactly welcome with open arms. A bit of male bonding behind the wheel will be required.In another Bay trademark Tessa spends most of the movie in a full-out Bayed run maneuvering through raging robots in skinny jeans and four-inch heels. Will someone please float the idea of sensible shoes for the requisite hot chick past Bay?Now to the Dinobots who get their own back story. One of Joyces scientists discovers the metal bones of a dinosaur in some frozen tundra -- trust me the specifics arent important but the filmmakers do not agree. So we take a side trip down memory lane to see how Dinobots came to be. Later Optimus Prime will pick up the story talking about the legendary knights. Grimlock is the main dino though the creature variations include Scorn Slash Slug and Strafe. Though they do have the capacity to change shapes too they pretty much look like big metal mash-ups of the beasties who roamed during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods not to mention ""Game of Thrones"" dragons. Fire-breathing is part of the package.The major battleground moves between Beijing and Hong Kong with Hong Kong getting the brunt of the Baying. Pretty much everybody -- bot or human -- fights everybody else at some point before the final credits roll.Bay continues to get better at staging the battles making it easier to follow which particular metal warrior or villain is being shredded. It allows even the uninitiated to appreciate the incredible technical wizardry required to make all those grinding gears that are constantly assembling and disassembling interesting. Its clear that while much of the focus is on the fighting the intent was to ratchet up the story too. Theres a lot of pontificating going on with Lockdown Optimus Galvatron Attinger and Joyce having a whole lot of opinions on a whole lot of things including good and evil life and death humans and robots.Though Cullens Optimus does kind of sound like some higher power who ought to be listened to the most interesting voice is Wahlberg. The actor continues to be such a likable on-screen presence that it is easy to overlook some of the really corny lines hes asked to deliver. Grammer spends his time glowering at friend and foe alike basically the pomposity of ""Frasier"" without the funny. Tuccis Joyce has a relatively transformative character arc from villain to ... its ludicrous but I dont want to spoil it. Besides the actor makes it entertaining regardless.But mankind -- good bad indifferent -- is never really the point in these movies.The filmmaker has actually built a better ""Transformers"" in ""Age of Extinction"" one Im sure fans of the franchise will adore. Its still not a great movie but it is most definitely full-metal Bay.betsy.sharkeylatimes.comTwitter BetsySharkey Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Reviews Column Entertainment Mark Wahlberg Kelsey Grammer Stanley Tucci Transformers Age of Extinction is a hybrid in more ways than one Sequel or reboot?

By JOCELYN NOVECK AP National Writer Published 26 June 2014 0250 PM Updated 26 June 2014 0317 PM Crash. Shatter. Boom. Crash. Shatter. Boom. Smattering of silly dialogue. Pretty girl screams ""Dad"" Crash. Shatter. Boom. Silly dialogue. ""DAD"" Crash. Shatter. Boom.What? Oh sorry. We were falling into a trance there.Which is dear moviegoer what may happen to you during Michael Bays ""Transformers Age of Extinction"" the fourth Transformers film and at 165 minutes precariously close to the three-hour mark that Bay undoubtedly will reach -- by our sophisticated calculations and at the current growth rate with his sixth installment.But lets not get ahead of ourselves. Despite what youve just read this film will likely be a massive hit because by now if youre buying a ""Transformers"" ticket you surely know what youre getting into and you want more more more. And Bay is the Master of More.Or just take it from the 11-year-old sitting next to me who reserved any audible judgment -- he too was in a trance though maybe from sugar intake -- until the moment he saw a Transformer become a dinosaur. Overwhelmed by the pairing he proclaimed ""Thats the sickest thing Ive ever seen in my life."" It was as if peanut butter and jelly had been tasted together for the first time.While you ponder where between these extreme reactions youll fall a quick update. This time theres a whole new human cast. Most important Mark Wahlberg has replaced Shia LaBeouf as well Main Human Guy and the good news is that Wahlbergs grounded quality rough charm and really nice biceps make him a thoroughly welcome presence. The bad news He isnt immune to the numbing effects of some desperately cheesy dialogue (Ehren Kruger wrote the screenplay).A significant part of the movie also takes place in China -- clearly a nod to the franchises huge market there. Whether such obvious wooing of the Chinese audience will work or backfire -- the film also includes very obvious placement of Chinese products -- remains to be seen.In any case we begin in Paris Texas where Cade Yeager (Wahlberg) a struggling inventor is desperately seeking a big discovery. Hes also a widowed dad and super-protective (as the movie incessantly reminds us) of his high-school daughter Tessa (Nicola Peltz blond and pretty and ineffective though the one-note script does her no favors).One day Cade buys a rusty old truck. Examining it back home he soon discovers its none other than Optimus Prime the Autobot hero seriously damaged.As Cade works on fixing him up his assistant wisecracking surfer-dude Lucas (T.J. Miller mildly amusing) has the dumb idea of calling the authorities. What he doesnt know is that the government -- actually the head of CIA black ops Harold Attinger (Kelsey Grammer expertly villainous) -- is plotting to destroy all remaining Autobots in favor of a man-made army of Transformers. Hes being helped in this endeavor by the shadowy KSI corporation run by the nasty-but-complicated Joshua Joyce (Stanley Tucci giving the most entertaining performance in the film).So now its evil humans pitted against the trustworthy Autobots. So much for gratitude. Theres also a subplot involving Tessa and her secret boyfriend Shane (Jack Reynor underused) whose Irish accent leads Cade to dismissively call him ""Lucky Charms"" -- at least until the two bond in battle.From here its up to you. You can try to follow the ins and outs of the battling forces -- robot and human man-made and alien ancient and modern -- or just watch things crash into each other blow up or both.The obvious question is it too much for its own good? Bay is very talented at all things visual the 3-D works well and the robots look great. But the final confrontation alone lasts close to an hour and at some point you may find yourself simply in a daze unable to absorb any further action into your brain.But one viewers migraine is anothers euphoria. You decide.""Transformers Age of Extinction"" a Paramount Pictures release is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for ""intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action language and brief innuendo.""

Winds light and variable. Updated July 30 2016  153 am Full Forecast News Sports Business Go Life Buy/Sell Movie reviews Transformers 4 is a critique of crass Hollywood By Joe Williams joewilliamspost-dispatch.com 314-340-8344 Joe Williams Jun 26 2014 (...) Only if you wear the special limited-edition 3-D glasses to the new ""Transformers"" movie will you see that Episode 4 is a sly critique of how technology is destroying Hollywood.An early scene is set in an abandoned movie palace where Texas tinkerer Cade Yeager (two-time Oscar nominee Mark Wahlberg) digs through the trash for parts he can recycle. The aging owner of the theater grumbles that sequels killed the movie business and he tries to sell Cade an outmoded projector by claiming that its digital.Instead Cade buys the mans rusty truck which is loaded with artillery shells. Those who remember the robotic Battle of Chicago at the end of ""Transformers 3"" will understand that director Michael Bay is challenging the widowed Cade and therefore all of us to continue the fight against soulless technology in memory of the martyred Shia LaBeouf.But the younger generation as symbolized by Cades teen daughter Tessa (wax figurine Nicola Peltz) is too busy posing in hot pants to care about the future of the human race. Sinister men in black (a reference no doubt to the matrix of conformity from which we have not awakened) deduce that the truck is actually Optimus Prime the leader of the ""good"" Transformers (i.e. Autobots) who still havent moved their feud with the ""bad"" Transformers (i.e. Decepticons) away from human population centers. Cade sides with the talking truck over the tight-lipped G-men; but Tessa doesnt fight for freedom until her car-racing boyfriend Shane (Jack Reynor) assures her that her hair wont get mussed. Their mission is to infiltrate the KSI Corporation in miraculously rebuilt Chicago where evil ninny Joshua Joyce (Stanley Tucci) is working with CIA cutthroat Harold Attinger (Kelsey Grammer) to clone Transformers and win the World Series for the Cubs. (I think.)In an homage to such ""cinema of cruelty"" classics as Andy Warhols real-time ""Sleep"" Bay allows the film to run for almost three hours and abandons all pretense of a plot. By the time the ""action"" shifts to Hong Kong the movie is little more than a mega-budget version of ""The Amazing Race"" with cartwheeling car-bots and mechanized dinosaurs.Because the affable Wahlberg is making the sales pitch you could kid yourself that this is just a high-tech vacuum cleaner built to siphon loose change like popcorn. But our failure to understand the terrifying significance of the ""Transformers"" series is why were in the age of extinction.

By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 411pm on Thursday Jun. 26 2014 Thursday Jun. 26 2014 Thursday Jun. 26 2014 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Theres only one thing anyone really needs to know about Transformers Age of Extinction Michael Bays fourth exercise in robot-on-robot violence and aggressive product placement at nearly three hours its the longest ""Transformers"" movie yet.Any mention of the leaden dialogue wooden acting laugh-free jokes deafening volume and enough explosives to knock the Earth off its axis would just be piling on. The shame is that it didnt have to be this way. Even though the franchise is really just one long commercial for Hasbros Transformers toys the first film the one in which humanity initially came into contact with the warring intergalactic robots who can shape-shift into cars trucks and awesome weaponry had a sense of humor about itself. The follow-up Revenge of the Fallen was unwatchable but the third installment Dark of the Moon showed fits of inspiration amid the excess.With Extinction Bay -- working from a script by Ehren Kruger (who also wrote the last two ""Transformers"" movies) -- had a chance to start from scratch. The entire human cast from previous films including star Shia LaBeouf as steadfast Sam Witwicky is gone. Taking LaBeoufs place at the heart of the story is workhorse Mark Wahlberg -- not a bad trade.But the biggest reason why Age of Extinction should be better can be summed up in one word dinobots. Die-hard fans of these half-robot/half-reptile creatures from the Transformers cartoons in the 80s have been waiting for three decades to see their heroes -- led by the less-than-eloquent but stout-hearted Grimlock -- portrayed on the live-action big screen. Who doesnt like the idea of a robot-dinosaur mash-up? Well Bay apparently because the dinobots show up late in the movie and dont have much to do but serve as handmaidens to the good-guy Autobots in their perpetual brawl with the bad-mood Decepticons. What a waste.The story this time centers on a failed impoverished Texas inventor Cade Yeager (Wahlberg) who with his pal Lucas (T.J. Miller) stumbles across a trashed big-rig truck while scavenging through an abandoned movie theater for parts to sell. Of course its not just any truck but chief Autobot Optimus Prime -- who is not only being hunted by Decepticons but also the humans.In the previous films humans and Autobots were allies but now -- in the wake of the massive Autobot/Decepticon war that destroyed Chicago the last time around -- humanity is sick of all of them. But its up to Cade and his (of course) beautiful daughter Tessa (Nicola Peltz) and her (of course) brave boyfriend Shane (Jack Reynor) to show the world that the Autobots are still worth fighting for.On the other side the CIA through devious Harold Attinger (Kelsey Grammer) is scheming to destroy all the remaining robots and send their parts to a robotics corporation run by the ambitious Joshua Joyce (Stanley Tucci the best part of the movie). His job is to create a new generation of robots that will be subservient to human desires. Good luck with that.Bay has been making a lot of noise about how this is the first film to use the 65 mm IMAX 3D camera and yes some of the special effects are impressive in this 165 million spectacle that makes Godzilla look like a grade-school puppet show. But a few more bucks on the script would have been a better investment because having our heroic robots yelling ""Die b----"" and ""This ones for you a-hole"" is snickering pandering lazy writing that Beavis and Butt-head would have found insulting to their intelligence.Just as maddening is the heavy-handed product placement much of it for Hong Kong and China where some of the movie was filmed and where no doubt producers hope to find a huge audience. The scene where Joshua in the midst of destruction pops open a Chinese drink so that everyone can see the brand should have been too much even for Bay.But theres one part that hints at what Age of Extinction could have been if as much time and effort had been spent on storytelling as technology and promotion. Its a simple chase down the exterior of a Hong Kong tenement in which Cade is running from one of the many bad guys.Well-staged and suspenseful the scene reaches for a Bourne Identity level of intensity. But this is just a brief respite from the rest of the movies incessant dullness.And with 165 minutes to fill theres a lot of it.

"Transformers Age of Extinction shows the tanks empty for Michael Bay review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesTransformers Age of Extinction shows the tanks empty for Michael Bay reviewIts long its loud and its really stupid. Its Transformers Age of Extinction the regrettable fourth instalment in the movie series of Hasbros robot alien toy franchise.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. June 26 2014Transformers Age of ExtinctionStarring Mark Wahlberg Stanley Tucci Kelsey Grammer Nicola Peltz Jack Reynor and Li Bingbing. At GTA theatres. Directed by Michael Bay. At GTA theatres. 165 minutes. PGIts long its loud and its really stupid. Its Transformers Age of Extinction the regrettable fourth instalment in Michael Bays movie series of Hasbros robot alien toy franchise.Article Continued BelowWith a whole new cast of humans plus some additional robots featuring Mark Wahlberg as lead gawker replacing the skedaddled Shia LaBeouf director Bay has essentially rebooted his own series. Transformers Age of Extinction runs almost three hours this time around with plenty of the usual explosions and clanking machinery.  (Paramount Pictures / AP)  But with a bloated running time of 165 minutes neither he nor screenwriting accomplice Ehren Kruger seems to understand or care where this noise goes anymore.This is a franchise known for huge explosions and clanking machinery and if thats what you want Age of Extinction has plenty. As for intelligence wit and genuine thrills not so much.Surrounding these ear-bashing bots are a gaggle of dumbfounded and/or malevolent humans and frankly everyone here is as boring as a tax seminar. It bears repeating that this film is long loud and really really stupid. Anybody paying 13 bucks to see this monstrosity should get 14 bucks in change.Having kicked evil Decepticon butt in the previous film trashing Chicago in the process the good-guy Autobots led by Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen) are now in hiding from the humans they helped. Government and industry moustache twirlers (Kelsey Grammer and Stanley Tucci) are in cahoots to terminate with extreme prejudice the remaining Autobots using man-made Transformers patterned on Decepticon leader Megatron.Wahlbergs Cade Yeager a widower and robot brainiac discovers an ailing Optimus Prime disguised as an old truck and helpfully gets out the wrench and grease gun. Hes reluctantly assisted by his comely 17-year-old daughter Tessa (Nicola Peltz) and her car racer boyfriend Shane (Jack Reynor) whom dad despises.Cue another two hours of exploding and flying metal inane and offensive dialogue (men and robots calling each other ""bitch"") and a tedious sexist feud between Cade and Shane over whether Tessa is old enough to date. Theres also a spaceship magical apocalyptic ""seeds"" and some new dinosaur bots that look like they escaped from a LEGO test lab. Chances are youll cease caring about the story long before the last mechanical belch.The visuals are akin to throwing garden tools at an overturned lawn mower for three hours in the midst of a massive fireworks display. So much CGI is used it has the effect of giving both humans and bots a cartoonish weightless effect where all pain and destruction is like Wile E. Coyote bouncing right back after being struck by an Acme anvil.The acoustics range from clanging and banging to a score by Steve Jablonsky that sounds as if he was twirling a knob on electronic trumpets between points marked ""mournful"" and ""triumphal.""Age of Extinction might have been mildly tolerable as time-wasting trash if Bay hadnt also sunk to new lows in cynicism and exploitation. The film is rife with dire stereotypes and appalling product placement plugs the latter ranging from Bud Lite to Victorias Secret to a fruit juice thats popular in China and Hong Kong where the films lengthy second half takes place with popular local actor Li Bingbing joining the overburdened cast.Why are the Transformers in China and Hong Kong? Money money and more money -- the series is huge in Asia co-financed by Chinese interests and for Bay it dont mean a thing if it aint got ka-ching.He even seems to do a shout-out in favour of Chinese authorities as characters speak of being protected by a benevolent ""central government.""Do you get the impression I hated this movie? I really did. I had a tooth filled on the day I saw Age of Extinction and the drilling was less painful than watching this.This is a series far drawn out past its shelf life and the unsubtle hints at a fifth Transformers film only underlines this movies many offences.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Stephanie Merry June 26 2014 Follow stephmerry Its only natural to get a little excited about the title of ""Transformers Age of Extinction"" and not because it means another installment of talking machines battling to the death. Its the word ""extinction."" Could this mean that Michael Bay is throwing in the towel on his loud and lumbering franchise after this fourth chapter? Ha. Actually a fifth movie is reportedly in the works. The extinction in the title refers to the fact that some loathsome Transformers were responsible for the annihilation of dinosaurs and they may have a similar plan for humans. The movie begins in prehistoric times before bringing us to a modern-day reality and the unfolding of all those eons feels like its happening in real time. The movie clocks in at an astonishing 2 hours 45 minutes. This ""Transformers"" is technically a reboot and one thing the movie has going for it is its lack of Shia LaBeouf. Instead we follow a new cast of characters led by Mark Wahlberg. He plays Cade Yeager a kind of mad scientist inventor who runs a robotics repair shop in Texas. He cant fix a machine to save his life but when a decaying semi winds up in his care he has no trouble bringing it back to life. Of course this isnt just some old truck Its Optimus Prime the benevolent leader of the Autobots (a.k.a. the good-guy Transformers). Wahlberg has a great screen presence and gets off some good one-liners during the movies early moments. Hes a single father to the teenaged Tess (Nicola Peltz) and just when youre wondering how this girls shorts could be so microscopic -- and there are plenty of opportunities to ponder with all the close-ups -- Cade makes some comment about how she needs to remember to use cold water and air dry next time shes doing laundry. But the relative pleasure of those first minutes is thanks largely to T.J. Miller best known as the outlandish Erlich on HBOs ""Silicon Valley."" He has a similar role here as a somewhat clueless bum with a hilariously outsize sense of self-worth. But there isnt a lot of time for comedy when evil men and robots are out to get Optimus Prime. One such person is Harold Attinger (Kelsey Grammer) the head of a CIA program aimed at destroying all Autobots. His henchmen include a Decepticon (a.k.a. a bad-guy Transformer) named Lockdown and a heartless creep played by Titus Welliver. When these predators discover where Optimus Prime is hiding neither the Autobot nor Cades friends and family are safe. Cue the action. Some of the special effects are amazing. Bay shot the movie in Imax 3-D and he makes the most of the technology. Watching a steamship get sucked into the air by a spaceship only to be thrown back to the ground might have viewers covering their heads. The problem is quantity. There are so many action sequences related to so many story lines that midway through an epic fight you might find yourself wondering what exactly started this particular battle and what the objective is other than destruction for the sake of it. All those minutes devoted to crunching metal come at the expense of not just character and plot development but also simple transitions. The movie moves both too slowly and too quickly as scene transitions appear to have been stripped or significantly shortened during the editing process. Even the lengthy run time isnt sufficient to develop the many story lines from a subplot involving Tesss secret boyfriend (Cade doesnt let her date) to a scientist played by Stanley Tucci who wants to take old Transformer parts and create newer better Transformers that he can control. We can all guess how well that goes. Distractions meanwhile abound whether theyre music-heavy slow-motion sequences that look reminiscent of ""CSI Miami"" or absurd product placement. The lingering close-up of a Beats Pill speaker is especially egregious. And then there are the self-referential scenes in which an older character who once owned a movie theater laments the current state of cinema All these sequels and theyre all just garbage the man sighs. It might be funnier if it werent so true. Transformers Age of Extinction  1/2 PG-13. At area theaters. Contains intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action strong language and brief innuendo. 165 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Photo Credit Andrew Cooper advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Humans turn against the Autobots only to find that Earth has a bigger problem. Rated PG-13. BOTTOM LINE Michael Bays robot franchise finally implodes with this incoherent and interminably long spectacle. CAST Mark Wahlberg Nicola Peltz Stanley Tucci LENGTH 245 Like a nuclear arsenal launched by an insane despot Michael Bays ""Transformers Age of Extinction"" aims for a million different targets and incinerates them beyond recognition. Nearly everything youve ever seen in a movie and possibly on Earth is here -- not just benevolent robots called Autobots but things like dinosaurs CIA operatives spaceships muscle cars and Stanley Tucci. All are swirled together in an IMAX-sized mushroom-cloud of flame and ash which means that the fourth ""Transformers"" movie will probably set the box-office ablaze too. This hyperaggressive and rather desperate-seeming production is essentially a reboot with an overhauled cast. Former franchise star Shia LaBeouf has been so thoroughly eradicated that his character might as well have died in the last episodes climactic battle in Chicago. Mark Wahlberg takes the lead as Cade Yeager a struggling inventor whose sexy teenage daughter Tessa (Nicola Peltz always in short-shorts) is secretly dating Shane (Jack Reynor) an Irish-Texan race-car driver. Tucci as a Jobsian tech-guru named Joshua Joyce replaces John Turturro in the comic-relief role.

Coherence has never been a priority for these movies but returning screenwriter Ehren Kruger seems to have given up. The plot includes ruthless government official Harold Attinger (Kelsey Grammer) who is helping an alien called Lockdown chase Optimus Prime (the voice of Peter Cullen) and his Autobots. Theyre a mostly new crew of voices including John Goodman as gung-ho Hound and Ken Watanabe as the mecha-samurai Drift. Everything is engineered for maximum spectacle and overseas profits (the Chinese government is portrayed briefly and glowingly) but the choppy editing and overstuffed story make this nearly three-hour epic feel interminably dull. ""Age of Extinction"" wreaks such indiscriminate havoc that it ends up blowing itself to smithereens.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Michael Bay films may be loud dumb and tasteless but theyre rarely boring at least not on the big screen. Bays flashy amped-up style packs movies with off-kilter compositions gonzo effects shots and bursts of super-saturated color; it stimulates often at the expense of consistency or coherence. With Transformers Age Of Extinction however Bay seems to have exhausted himself. The fourth longest and flimsiest entry in the directors signature franchise finds Bay mostly in cruise control snapping to only when the movie veers away from the ""robots fighting in tax-friendly locations"" formula--which unfortunately isnt very often. Age Of Extinctions sense of creative burnout is amplified by the fact that it follows on the heels of one of Bays best (and not coincidentally tightest) films Pain amp; Gain a nasty vigorous movie about the big dumb American Dream. If Pain amp; Gain--a long-gestating passion project that seemed to take its narrative and stylistic cues from Casino--showcased all of Bays strengths Age Of Extinction plays like a catalogue of his weaknesses. Pain amp; Gain lead Mark Wahlberg stars as Cade Yeager a Texas inventor who builds robots from spare parts--a role that puts Wahlberg near the top of the pantheon of unconvincing movie scientists. (He even dons glasses. Nice try.) While scavenging an abandoned movie theater--a scene that throws in a dig at Bays critics with Richard Riehles theater owner complaining about todays ""sequels remakes and reboots"" while pointing at a poster for El Dorado--Yeager stumbles upon a beaten-up semi which turns out to be Autobot leader Optimus Prime.At this point it may be necessary to recap the franchise which counting Age Of Extinction runs about as long as Wagners Ring Cycle. Giant alien robots arrive on Earth and take on the appearance of motor vehicles transforming into their true forms whenever necessary. The good ones are called Autobots though not all of them transform into cars. The bad ones are called Decepticons and their leader is named Megatron. Every movie--including this one--ends with the Autobots looking skyward and declaring that the real battle is still to come. The last battle that wasnt a ""real"" battle--the one at the end of Transformers Dark Of The Moon--left most of the Chicago Loop destroyed. Unsurprisingly this has made Transformers unpopular with the general public and as Age Of Extinction opens theyre being hunted by a CIA black-ops unit that sells their remains to a Chicago-based company called KSI.KSIs style-conscious CEO is Joshua Joyce (Stanley Tucci) a kind of double for Yeager and the only interesting character in the history of the franchise. Like Yeager Joyce is an inventor who works from salvage--in this case the ridiculously named ""transformium"" which he extracts from Transformer parts. He is as rich and solitary as Yeager is poor and family-focused and his clean white lab is the exact opposite of Yeagers cluttered makeshift workshop. The discovery of Optimus Prime turns Yeager and his teenage daughter Tessa (Nicola Peltz) into fugitives leading them to Monument Valley Chicago and finally Hong Kong. At the latter two locales Yeager Tessa and her Irish boyfriend Shane (Jack Reynor) scramble to hide while the surviving Autobots duke it out with a squad of alien bounty hunters who are working with the CIA. Dark Of The Moons exhaustive destruction of Chicago was the franchises high-water mark as special-effects spectacle an extravaganza of shifting scales flaming wreckage and collapsing skyscrapers. Aside from Independence Day its hard to think of another movie that seemed to have more fun destroying a city--a toy room approach that for once was completely in line with the franchises action figure origins. Age Of Extinction on the other hand is dominated by two comparatively tame slog-like battle scenes that seem mostly concerned with maintaining a strict one-to-one ratio of extreme low-angle shots to product placements. Bay remains hooked on the former and comically brazen about the latter (at one point Yeager crashes into a Bud Light truck gets out and guzzles down an entire refreshing beer) but the stuff in between feels joyless and impersonal even with the addition of fire-breathing robot dinosaurs. The movie perks up when it leaves the burned-out cityscapes and garish colors behind first at the KSI headquarters (where two pairs of clicking stiletto heels allow Bay to indulge his penchant for off-putting mechanized sex) and later aboard the bounty hunters Giger-esque space ship. The KSI scenes--which suggest that Joyce is a double not just for Yeager but for Bay himself--are full of self-deprecating digressions on aesthetics and business designed around elegant black and white lines that are a world away from the franchises usual rubble-strewn palette. The spaceship--which features the movies most consistent action sequence--is a lavish piece of Alien fan fiction with every shot angled around the internal architectures slithery biomechanical curves. A viewer cant help but get the feeling that Bay is tired of making Transformers movies. One can only film people pretending to look up at robots for so long.

In the process the New York Film Festival will come and go providing the director with the opportunity to experience some of the best new movies from around the world. He can take long walks around the city. Maybe hell see a Broadway show. At the end of the endeavor he might make something brilliant but that doesnt mean everyone will see it. If youre troubled by the struggle of great cinema to gain the attention it deserves ask yourself this How many people missed the news about Alonsos residency but are acutely aware of a new ""Transformers"" movie opening this weekend? Alonsos name may not strike a chord with every moviegoer especially audiences only aware of new releases through the prism of marketing campaigns. But this patient thoughtful director has made a number of acclaimed experimental narratives in recent years including the visually arresting and nearly wordless 2008 travelogue ""Liverpool"" in which a seaman travels across Argentina to visit his aging mother. At this years Cannes Film Festival Alonso unveiled his grandest feat to date the impressionistic fantasy ""Jauja"" starring Viggo Mortensen. Shot in the square 43 ""Academy ratio"" with a stylish frame around its edges throughout this delicate colorful tale features a Danish man and his daughter in 19th century Argentina in search of a utopia they never quite find. When the daughter suddenly vanishes halfway through the picture her dad spends much of the running time wandering the barren landscape eventually arriving in a place of complete abstraction that explores the deterioration of innocence in strange and exciting ways. ""Jauja"" has yet to finalize a U.S. distribution deal but even if it lands one nobody can seriously make the case that the movie will receive even a small fraction of the eyeballs committed to ""Transformers Age of Extinction"" as it lumbers into theaters around the world this weekend. But with the announcement of Alonsos residency arriving just days ahead of Michael Bays latest spectacle the contrast between these two visually striking fantasy films couldnt be more extreme. Both contain moments of extraordinary beauty specific to the moving image but whereas ""Jauja"" gives them a poetic context the multimillion-dollar effects work in Michael Bays latest flashy endeavor is unsurprisingly hollow. The Studio Scheme Of course countless ticket-paying audiences have been convinced -- through expertly-designed trailers hulking billboards and an endless stream of toy tie-ins -- that the pricey simplicity of ""Transformers"" contains exactly what they want out of a big summer movie. Certainly the new installment delivers on those expectations. Its spectacular opening minutes feature a menacing spaceship barreling down on Earth in the midst of the dinosaur age effectively destroying the species and planting the seeds of a new automated menace that comes to life in the prolonged closing act. Yes the dinosaurs are extraordinary technological feats that make ""Jurassic Park"" look like like stop motion animation. Youre unlikely to witness a more condensed celebration of the IMAX 3-D experience this year. But nothing in the nearly three-hour running time of ""Transformers Age of Extinction"" can match that opening Swapping Mark Wahlberg for Shia Labeouf Bay stuffs in a slight narrative involving the efforts of a straight-faced inventor in rural Texas who comes across a damaged Optimus Prime and manages to resurrect the autobots leader during a challenging time since the CIA (headed by a bland Kelsey Grammar) has decided that all Transformers are evil aliens and launches a full-out assault against them. Picking up its pace where most movies tend to wind down ""Age of Extinction"" reveals a scheme by another inventor (Stanley Tucci) to use the wreckage of a Transformers battle from the previous installment to build their own. This provides an excuse for someone to actually say ""We can change anything into anything."" The storytelling burrows just that deep. Despite its hefty running time not much happens in ""Age of Extinction."" The autobots engage in some nicely rendered battles with the mutant robot known as Galvatron eventually heading to Beijing and resurrecting some transformers from the past to help out. As usual Bay constructs a barrage of showdowns remarkable for their ridiculous propensity to feature explosions and slo-mo gravity-defying feats. Theyre all unmemorable but equally loud and visceral. The popularity of ""Transformers"" suggests thats everything viewers want from them. Something Empty For Everyone Collectively these movies represent an assault on the senses thats actively fighting against the prospects of a more varied film culture. Whereas the proactive moviegoer aims to see as many new movies as possible ""Transformers Age of Extinction"" argues that you only need to see one. In what seems like a blatant attempt to replicate a Bollywood production the ""Transformers"" movies stuff together any number of disjointed ingredients in the hopes of providing a mainstream entertainment that delivers thrills for as many people as possible irrespective of the jumbled bigger picture. The only missing ingredient is a musical number -- but dont rule it out of future installments. Though it might seem counterintuitive to ask for quality from a product designed to deliver a cheap escape some modicum of the franchises success stems from the purer satisfaction of the first installment which featured a self-awareness that bordered on camp. (Optimus Prime confessing that he relied on eBay to figure out a key plot point is a better form of movie magic than the CGI itself.) The Choice Is Yours Since then with the promise of the spectacle established worldwide Bay has kept things remarkably simple and irony-free; ""Age of Extinction"" feels unapologetically commercial in every way possible from the cartoonish sex appeal of Nicola Peltz as Wahlbergs underdeveloped daughter character to the climax in China thats ostensibly set there for economic reasons. (Kevin Lees brilliant video essay ""Transformers The Premake"" does a terrific job of sketching out the movies global identity.) Among the movies ""human cast"" termed as much in the movies press notes nobody tries to elevate the material aside from Stanley Tucci who spends one amazing scene cracking up in an elevator as he attempts to sketch out the plot. But thats a brief moment of meta in this otherwise empty beast. Even viewers who might not care for a new Lisandro Alonso movie could still ignore ""Transformers"" this weekend for a better action product with Bong Joon-hos energizing post-apocalyptic narrative ""Snowpiercer"" also opening on Friday which marks the best case of counter-programming this year. But if youre one of those viewers curious about ""Snowpiercer"" and choosing to see ""Age of Extinction"" this weekend instead believe me I get it Those robots look really cool. Just remember as the autobots careen towards another triumph in the closing moments that no matter which side of the battle wins in this installment theres a bigger fight taking place well beyond the multiplex.

""The most audacious low-budget American independent film-making is threatened much more significantly by misplaced critical praise for art-house mediocrities than by Hollywood."" Between this and the other mediocre articles the sponsored pseudo op-ed and even sponsored reviews cue for me to leave Indiewire. Reply roberta May 12 2016 1131 am Thank you for your article. I am a mother of 4 teenagers who went from the Transformers to more quality films in spite of the heavy promotion and have benefited from messages of ethical values from other movies of the Sci-fi genre. Reply remcy May 12 2016 1131 am To call the transformers current incarnation Sci-fi is to cheapen the the genre (Compare with Starwars or any of Asimovs books). What it is is content free escapism. Even the technical content of special effects is without imagination. It is clear that Transformers is a marketing success. Senjins comment is an instance proof. But what it ha negative intellectual content. Kohns piece is right on. Reply senjin black May 12 2016 1131 am ""The choice is yours""... I love it. The author spends the entire article lambasting Transformers and by extension the people who like this type of movie then gives the readers this ""choice"". Priceless. Well Ill say this the choice IS mine so I can watch an art film or a sci-fi movie a thoughful drama or a slapstick comedy or whatever else strikes my fancy. Talking down to people is never a good motivator in my opinion. It would seem thatif the authourreally wanted readers to pay attention to a certian movie or director then they shoud write about why that movie or director is good not how something else is bad. You know the point of a rollercoaster is to have fun it goes up and it goes down not overly complex and not obnoxious in its own perceived importance its just fun. Now whats so bad about that? Reply Petros Tsanalredes May 12 2016 1131 am Great article So many crap movies. So much money. I dont believe it is free market forces that load the cinemas with dull franchise movies. I believe it is the opposite -- the big-six have a monopoly well an oligarchy really. They may not own the theaters anymore but they sure do control them. Hollywood doesnt want new ideas unless they can buy them cheap enough to keep the talent that created the idea from competing with them and then only if they can predict their success based on direct analogy (which means the ideas cant be very new) which was probably why it was so hard for Disney to figure out why the Lone Ranger sucked so bad. Gee - Whiz same studio same producers same director same writers same actor as Pirates -- Its just Pirates in the dessert -- Who would hire any of those guys again when apparently they have nothing really to do with the success of a film? Oh well they get away with it most of the time. Hollywood uses money to buy their audiences rather than talent and if it were the other way around the big studios would be replaced with brilliant fresh new film makers every 20 years -- you know the way it used to be when Easy Rider and Midnight Cowboy came out and rocked the boat. Even Hollywood was founded on rebels that didnt want to pay royalties to Kodak and Edison in New York if my recollection of film history serves but they have it all locked up and nobody else will get in once they close up the internet and squeeze the independents out by slowing their downloads and searches. Reply Doris May 12 2016 1131 am Way to go It takes guts to tell it like it is. Thanks Reply Joe Blow May 12 2016 1131 am Its simple supply amp; demand. Give ""Snowpiercer"" the same marketing budget and screens as Transformers and I guarantee the end result will be nowhere near close. We will all be calling Snowpiercer a flop. Reply Gadfly May 12 2016 1131 am A thoughtful presentation on the state of current movie culture. Im proud this critic has the guts to actually be critical. What the ""I love mainstream"" commenters forget is that ""pop culture"" is driving out ""art house"" and niche culture making them financially unsustainable in a way that weve never seen before. Yes this damages culture which thrives on diversity. It also damages diversity in Hollywood which continues to make less movies every year. We may not be able to change this onslaught of stupidity (driven by the hegemony of international box office) but it doesnt mean we have to like it. This article actually feels like it deserves the ""Indie"" in ""Indiewire."" Stay critical. To hell with the codswallops; maybe paramount can quote them in their next marketing campaign. Reply Niner May 12 2016 1131 am Hey Eric Youre correct - the choice is mine. But its not and its never been an either/or one. Its a both/and one. Having Coke in the fridge doesnt automatically negate the space to also enjoy a Calvados cider a Founders breakfast stout or a snifter of Glenlivet single malt. Film culture continues to be varied with as much to enjoy around the periphery as whats offered from the centre. Making a see-this-instead-of-this argument does little to move the dialectic on and minimises the responsibility of the viewer to own their choices. Yes the signal-to-noise ratio is and always will be a factor but isnt that after all why we visit Indiewire? Reply HUH May 12 2016 1131 am Gee Eric Kohn doesnt like Transformers? TELL ME MORE. Reply sondra May 12 2016 1131 am This article shows that the studios are minimizing the responsibility to contribute to the education of the public. The argument that their popularity is driven by ""free market forces"" is sealy.The propaganda machine has manufactured their popularity. so the rest of quality films get buried in the noise... Reply Theo May 12 2016 1131 am In other words the problem with big dumb and fun (?) movies like Transformers is that they swamp the box office and dominate global cineplexes to the point that thats virtually all 95% of the human population ever sees. Its pure free market economics and thats not fair to filmmakers who actually give a damn about their target audiences have artistic talent and want to make an artistic statement instead being interested solely in cold hard cash profits. Its also unfair to those of us who actually understand and appreciate filmmaking talent to the point where we dont just act like dumb cats hypnotized by moving images on television when we watch film. I dont think this is healthy for social development for popular culture arts to always play to the lowest common denominator. I really wish that art lead commerce in the motion picture world rather than the other way around. I wish that movie distribution were governed by ""fair trade"" polices rather than what we have now which is just whatever sells the most tickets or has the best marketing scheme becomes the most widely shown. If you think thats socialist or snobbish then I dont really care -- those of us who appreciate the ART of cinema (and yes it should be considered an art not a product) have been forced to garble down this pop culture garbage and be bombarded by constant advertisements for crappy films for years. We ""elitists"" (as in actually possessing a brain) can and should complain as loud as we can. It will never drown out the yearly buffet of pig slop that is the vast majority of mainstream movie-going culture that the dimwitted masses consume year after year. You people get what you want we dont. We have every right to complain. You dont. As Tony Soprano would say ""End of story"" Reply parsyeb May 12 2016 1131 am For real I dont care about or like this franchise but trying to claim that this film means itself to be the only kind of film is an unsupportable dumb claim. And for what its worth Alonsos kind of filmmaking still requires top dollar and thus robs attention from avant-garde artists working with far lower budgets. And now Im more ""authentic"" than you for aligning myself with the less mainstream vehicle. See how that works? Reply Khronnos May 12 2016 1131 am These films are so loud marketing wise people cant help but pay attention. And they churn out big hype/low substance so often you cant hear anything else. After awhile thats all there is in your world. As indie filmmakers maybe we cant be as loud but we can definitely be smarter Splinter Cells. Give Hollywood what it wants fall in line like a good little filmmie. And when youre in nice and snugg and they love you stab them in the effin back by making films that people will actually remember 3 days later. Sincerely Advocate for Hollywood Mutiny Reply Sumner May 12 2016 1131 am Its a crying shame that for 75% of all good films one has to go to specialty theaters because rubbish like Transformers is dominanting the multiplex. This isnt exactly a new problem but I will go out of my way to purchase a ticket for an indie film (even one that isnt particularly interesting) just to give some semblence of support to good films. Reply James M. May 12 2016 1131 am Codswallop (because Im suddenly feeling British). A movie like ""Transformers"" is designed for people who feel like seeing a movie like ""Transformers"" and likewise for ""Snowpiercer."" With very few exceptions a person who generally ONLY sees movies like ""Transformers"" (i.e. the causal moviegoer) isnt likely to seek out ""Snowpiercer."" I get so tired of hearing pretentious movie snobs harp about how difficult it is to see ""good quality cinema."" Its been hard for DECADES now. Im fortunate to be someone who loves everything from Bergman and Malle to ""Transformers"" to the worst-of-the-worst grade-B horror sleaze. I love all movies and I dont feel like I have to make apologies for my preferences. Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Matt Taibbi on How Trumps Disastrous RNC Doomed the GOP Transformers Age of Extinction By Peter Travers June 26 2014 More News Summer Film Preview 2014 The Season of Fierce Boom and Bust 10 Best Michael Bay Explosions All Stories >> Michael Bay has done the impossible. With Transformers Age of Extinction the start of a - everyone duck - second trilogy in his metalhead franchise the Bay-man has made the worst and most worthless Transformers movie yet. I know hard to believe right? How could any summer blockbuster be as dull dumb and soul-sucking as the first three Transformers movies? Step right up. More News Summer Film Preview 2014 The Season of Fierce Boom and Bust 10 Best Michael Bay Explosions All Stories >> Bay with the help of screenwriter Ehren Kruger is telling the same damn story as he did before. But this time hes taking more time than ever to do it. Just shy of three hours Transformers Age of Extinction whether you see it in 2D 3D or IMAX 3D is a punishing endurance test. Even fans of the series and they are legion must know that the Hasbro toys that inspired the films have more complexity and feeling. The plot? Its been four years since the war between alien robots left Chicago devastated. In case you need a refresher Autobots led by Optimus Prime are good. Decepticons inspired by Megatron are bad. But it doesnt matter. Since even the human-friendly Autobots are being hunted down and destroyed. The governments dastardly plan these plans are always dastardly is to create their own race of Transformers to achieve the elusive goal of world domination. What it really means is that Bay can start the whole process all over again with robots fighting their own clones. Kill me now. Maybe Im being unfair. There is some new stuff. Bay has trashed his old human cast. Shia LaBeouf is gone as Sam Witwicky the teen pal to all things Autobot. In his place is Mark Wahlberg as Cade Yeager a nutty Texas robotics inventor who buys an old truck that turns out to be Optimus Prime. Wait what? Does this mean theres no Megan Fox or Rosie Huntington-Whiteley for Bays camera to slobber over. Never fear. Welcome Nicola Peltz as Tessa Cades 17-year-old daughter who wears heels and short-shorts even on the run so Bay can have his pervy cinematic way with her. Some things never change. The acting? There isnt any. Though I give credit to Stanley Tucci. He plays Joshua Joyce the head of Kinetic Sciences Institute (KSI) and the tycoon who has isolated a metal called ""Transformium"" that can mutate anything short of transforming Bay into a talented filmmaker with the gifts of say James Cameron and Christopher Nolan. But I digress. Its Joshua in league with CIA baddie Harold Attinger (Kelsey Grammer) who does a Frankenstein number on Galvatron a Transformer created from the evil DNA inside Megatrons decapitated head. Anyway Tucci is the only fully alive presence onscreen mostly because he seems to laughing inside at every idiot line hes given to say. The rest is all sound and fury signifying the usual Bay nothing. If you want to see metal crushing metal with no purpose logic or letup stay at home with your X box. At least youre in control and you can do a dozen other things at the same time. With Transformers Age of Extinction youre stuck with Bays video console. At one point the movie introduces the dinobots a new species of robot that struck fear in my heart that Bay may be contemplating a Jurassic Park reboot. Noooooooo The dinobots are actually meant to remind us of that calamitous moment in time when the power (called ""the seed"") was unleashed to ""turn organic life into metal."" In movie terms Bay has that power. And we are all the worse for it. Dont Miss a Story Sign up for our newsletter to receive breaking news directly in your inbox.

It is a jolting seizure-inducing stamina-testing physical experience that should be scored on the Richter scale or in terms of megatons. Michael Bay outdoes himself here creating the biggest bloatiest Michael Bay-est film ever. There is scarcely a moment in its 165 minutes that does not involve frenzied screaming smashing or shooting. Correction As we are in Bay country there are also scenes of sexy jailbait appalling dialogue product placement and tasteless racial stereotyping amid the metallic mayhem. There is good news. Shia LaBeouf is gone. So is his vapid girlfriend. And his other vapid girlfriend. And his annoying parents. In their place is Mark Wahlberg as an inventor. If you believe giant robots can metamorphose into swanky cars you can believe anything I guess. Like the fact that he finds a cobwebbed heavy transport truck (the noble shape-shifting Autobot Optimus Prime) in a derelict movie theater. Well of course you would. After the big rig responds in unorthodox ways to his tinkering Wahlberg announces ""I think weve found a Transformer."" There are many lines of that caliber. When Wahlberg demands to see a government agents search warrant Titus Welliver barks ""My face is my warrant."" My favorite comes when a rocket blasts into the Wahlberg home just missing Nicola Peltz. ""Dad"" she whines ""theres a missile in the living room."" The films out-of-control special-effects expenditures left little for Peltzs costuming; she is forced to wear barely-there cutoff jeans in most of her important running-and-shrieking scenes. The film has no more plot than a string of firecrackers but oh the explosions. Bay has never seen a vehicle he didnt want to flip or a sheet of glass he didnt want to shatter. The smithereens budget on this production must dwarf the GNP of Singapore. There is more pandemonium per square inch of film than the last 10 blockbusters combined. This is quite deliberately designed for overseas audiences. The films reverent portrait of the Chinese government and endless Hong Kong action finale seem designed to pack em in at the AMC Tiananmen Square. Its also sure to delight the series fans whod complain if a small child kicked the back of their seat throughout a movie but will pay 20 for a 3-D movie that continuously kicks them in the head. Colin Covert has covered films for the Star Tribune for 20 years interviewing Peter Jackson Kate Winslet Steven Spielberg Cate Blanchett Quentin Tarantino Neil Gaiman and John Travolta to name a few. Colins job as a film critic consists mostly of thinking up synonyms for ""mediocre."" He still gets a thrill when the lights dim and all too often a bigger thrill when they come on again.

Paramount Bill Goodykoontz USA TODAY NETWORK 251 p.m. MST June 26 2014The fourth film in the franchise finds Mark Wahlberg trying to protect his daughter (Nicola Peltz) while helping Optimus Prime. The story never makes much sense but things blow up nicely.Mark Wahlberg in ""Transformers Age of Distinction""(Photo Associated Press)Story HighlightsCritics review 1.5 stars""Some mysteries in the universe were not meant to be solved"" Optimus Prime intones gravely as he intones most everything in ""Transformers Age of Extinction.""Mysteries like the plot of this movie evidently. Its big its loud and its all over the place never really making a lick of sense. To his credit sort of director Michael Bay tries to insert a little story into the film early on even a little humor but thats overrun at some point by explosions and plot digressions most of which involve the giant androids that disguise themselves as vehicles known as Autobots (good guys) and Decepticons (bad guys).RELATED Top 10 movie trucks Duel Wages of FearAs the movie opens all that has changed. Humans specifically Americans have turned on Transformers of all kind declaring war on them after a fierce battle in Chicago. Black-ops agent Harold Attinger (Kelsey Grammer) has nefarious plans involving the Transformers and has enlisted the semi-unwitting help of Joshua Joyce (Stanley Tucci) a megalomaniac genius inventor who believes he is trying to create a better Transformer.RELATED Transformers in the tank? Not anytime soonBring me the head of Megatron OK no one actually says that but the noggin of the supposedly dead Decepticon leader does play a role in the film. Tucci and Grammer for what its worth are the best things about the movie.Meanwhile down on the farm. ... In Texas Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg) a down-on-his-luck inventor buys a broken-down old truck that turns out to be Optimus Prime (voice of Peter Cullen).Spoiler alert? Please. Who didnt see that coming? Ehren Krugers script veers between the obvious and the out-of-nowhere; this falls into the former camp.Anyway when hes not working on inventions that never quite come together Yeager is busy overprotecting his teenage daughter Tessa (Nicola Peltz). He helps fix Optimus but soon the Feds come calling at which point the usually great Titus Welliver delivers one of the best bad lines of the year. Wheres your warrant Yeager demands? ""My face is my warrant"" Wellivers agent replies. Thats inspired.Its at this point that Yeager realizes that Tessa has a secret boyfriend Shane (Jack Reynor) who as luck would have it is an expert driver which comes in handy when they have to escape.An evil Transformer named Lockdown (Mark Ryan) wants Optimus as much as Attinger does. The chase leads around the world to China and involves ""the seed"" which has to do with the beginning of life before ... seriously who cares? It all adds up to a massive fight loud enough to rattle the foundations of the theater or the brain inside your skull.In fairness Wahlberg is an improvement over Shia LaBeouf in the cardboard-cutout human-hero role.

I say sequels because the 2007 film the first live-action feature based on the cartoon based on the toy basically ""made sense."" It was silly but hewed more or less to what a major action films story usually looks like. The second one went off the rails completely but the Hollywood writers strike makes a nice scapegoat. The third one also was a disorienting swirl of plot bafflement but the final hours quite striking 3D ""Battle of Chicago"" made for a palate-cleansing sorbet. The point is despite seeing all three previous ""Transformers"" movies I have no clue what theyre about or really any insight into the characters. But I do have a vague sense that the last one was ""kinda fun."" Luckily thats all you need for part four ""Transformers Age of Extinction."" The slate is wiped (good riddance Monsieur LeBeouf) the nation is licking its wounds after Chicagos destruction (though the city looks well-repaired) and the Transformers have all gone underground. The CIA (hissssss) is hunting all of the robots-in-disguise be they Autobots (good guys) or Decepticons (bad guys.) But actually thats not true They are really only hunting Autobots because the top cheese at the CIA (Fraiser Crane) working in cahoots with a Steve Jobs-type (Stanley Tucci) have cut a deal with one of the Cybertronian villains named Lockdown. Lockdown who has Lamborghini branding but alas does not have a Chico Marx accent will give the human bad guys ""the seed"" if they get him the hulk of Optimus Prime. Whats the seed? The seed is and Im joking far less than you may think the intergalactic semen of ""The Creators"" that brought Cybertronian life into the Universe. (It resembles a small chrome torpedo.) And wheres Optimus Prime? Well Ill tell you. Optimus is hibernating in the barn of a junk collector/mad scientist/robotics expert deep in the heart of Texas. The part of Texas where theres corn and humongous American flags and ultra-thin hotties and its always magic hour. The barn belongs to Cade Yeager played by the Mark Wahlberg and his lack of Texas accent. While Mr. Wahlberg delivers many of his lines as if hes addressing animals this iteration of the ""Transformers"" films features something no previous installment ever had - a lead actor with charisma and talent. For years weve been joking ""the humans dont matter in these films."" They still dont but when youve got someone you kinda care about it helps. Wahlbergs driving motivation throughout the film is to keep his blonde tight-jeans wearing 17-year old minx of a daughter chaste. It isnt going well as she (Nicola Peltz heir to the Snapple fortune) is dating an Irish race car driver named Shane (Jack Reynor). 17? Is that legal? Yes it is due to something called the ""Romeo and Juliet"" laws of Texas and Shane actually KEEPS A COPY OF THIS LAW in his wallet. Way to go Shane You may now run for office. Soon the Feds come to the farm to find Optimus and - BLAM - the chase begins. Theres another highway fight (again Transformers do a lot of slo-mo cartwheeling and yanking hurled bodies to safety) and then once Optimus gets the band together they break into Steve Jobs evil Transformers lab and - and then I dunno. Theres a big battle in Chicago again this time with a space ship and then a big battle in Hong Kong. (Steve Jobs has a Transformers-making facility in China - if he doesnt brand them as ""Sinobots"" I dont know what I can do for him.) The battles - the reason anyone would want to see this movie - are for the most part entertaining. Theres a moment when giant steamships fall from the sky like rain. Stanley Tuccis cowardly technocrat wimpers and howls and is funny in a broad sense of the word. The fighting robots look less like thrown cutlery than they used to; you can kinda follow whats happening. Whereas the last two movies had almost no character motivation this one has a decent hook find that seed. (Its also a bomb that will kill everyone.) The dialogue is ludicrous but when you see it at a good theater there are few pleasures in life like having your seat vibrate with the deep resonant tones of Peter Cullens Optimus Prime. Cullens voice is a bonafide touchstone of this idiotic franchise - without him bellowing ""Roll out"" these movies would truly lose a lot. I hope Michael Bay and Paramount are giving this guy a lot of money. The other robo-voices are amusing too John Goodman plays a ""give-em-lead"" bruiser with a robo-cigar and Ken Watanabe plays a samurai who calls Optimus ""sansei"" and talks about shame. Theres another Autobot that wears a metal coat so when he zips around he looks like he comes from a cyborg version of a John Woo film. (Wikipedia tells me he was voiced by the same guy who voices Bender but I didnt hear it.) At the 2hr 15 min mark when any movie like this should already be over we meet the fan-favorite Dinobots. Yes robotic dinosaurs one of which is ridden into battle by Optimus Prime. You may applaud if you are still awake. I can not tell a lie. I had a fun enjoyable (albeit long) night at ""Transformers Age of Extinction."" Keep in mind I went with about ten colleagues/friends and didnt pay. Thats how it is for me with all movies but with something like this it really makes a difference.

After three episodes headlined by Shia LaBeouf as a young adult who befriends the Autobot Optimus Prime Bay launches a new cast of characters to fit into the ongoing intergalactic battle of Prime and his giant-car pals against the bad-bot Decepticons. Both a sequel and a reboot Transformers Age of Extinction which well call Trans4mers is the blockbuster the film industry has been waiting for all year. The movie is likely to register 2014s first 100 million three-day weekend at the domestic box office and match or exceed the 1.1 billion worldwide take of Bays last Transformers installment the 2011 Dark of the Moon. It also bears the signature excesses and lapses of Hollywoods most incorrigible director of megabudget action pictures and then some. In its third hour when the movie spins off its narrative rails Trans4mers goes botsh-t crazy. (READ Corlisss review of Transformers Dark of the Moon) The new hero is Mark Wahlberg as Cade Yeager a dreamy overmuscled tinkerer-inventor scraping by in rural Texas. Still grieving the loss of his wife he denies their sexy teen daughter Tessa (Nicola Peltz) any contact with boys saying ""This is a non-dating family."" The subtext for Cades possessiveness he doesnt want Tessa to get pregnant when shes too young as her mother did. In essence hes trying to retroactively erase the circumstances of his daughters birth. So Cade is furious when he learns that Tessa has a boyfriend Shane (Jack Reynor looking like an impossibly hunky Seth Rogen) who as a race-car driver is into machines just like her dad. The cycle repeats. For a while this mainstream movie wanders into the indie-film Land of Weird but like so many other aspects of Ehren Krugers screenplay its put out there for the audience to puzzle over then dropped. Having bought an old truck at the junk sale from a closed movie theater Cade fortuitously reignites Optimus Prime (again voiced by Peter Cullen) whos been petrified like the Tin Man in The Wizard of Oz until Cade provides the oil can. ""Youre supposed to call the government"" warns Cades surfer-dude assistant Lucas (T.J. Miller channeling the early Jason Lee). ""Its the American thing to do."" Too late. The government -- specifically a CIA black ops squadron headed by the Rumsfeldian Harold Attinger (Kelsey Grammer) -- is already on to Optimus. Storming the property and telling Cade ""My face is my warrant"" agent James Savoy (Titus Welliver) and his gang dispatch drones to blow the place up. (READ Corliss on the 75th anniversary of The Wizard of Oz) That sends Cade Tessa and Shane on a far-fetched rendezvous with Joshua to save the world from Attingers scheme to create a new breed of warrior from the transformium bots. Attinger has already pegged Optimus as an ""alien combatant here illegally"" as if the Autobot were a combination of Guantanamo inmate and Mexican anchor baby. Now the CIA rogue is in league with a superior machine called Lockdown (voiced with corrosive English snootiness by Mark Ryan) who is more or less Marvels Loki transplanted to the Hasbro universe. ""Its not their planet"" Lockdown says of Earths creatures. ""Never was. Time to take it back."" As in most monster epics the humans are incidental -- the merest collateral damage ants on a soccer pitch -- to the earth-shattering footfalls of the SPFX giants. Cade and Tessa will survive only by sheer dumb luck and by the need to keep the characters around for further episodes in what Bay intends as a second Transformers trilogy. We get hints of the bigger story when Lockdown eventually clashes with Optimus and sneers ""You werent born you were built. And your creator wants you back."" Cue the fifth Transformers. (READ How Michael Bay created the movie-industrial complex in the first Transformers) Rather than offering hope to haters of the series that its ending here the Age of Extinction subtitle refers to the destruction of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago not from an asteroid crash into Earth but from a flotilla of spaceships whose deadly artillery destroys most living things. This promise of a climactic assault of the dino-bots improving on the new Godzilla is only partially fulfilled but when theyre onscreen they look cool. Thats a problem with Bay he doesnt seem to know what hes good at. His Imax camera glides through impeccably choreographed tracking shots on land and in the air. The bot battles he and his FX crew stage are not just red meat for fanboys but the movies cinematic glory. The 15-second transformation of Optimus from a shabby pickup truck to a super-racer with flaming decal work is a wonder to watch. Lockdowns spaceship on which Cades and Optimus teams both sneak a ride has the rich detailing of a winged mastodon; its a plane with a demonic personality. (READ Mary Pols on the second Transformers movie) on Bays first Transformers movie) Yet Bay still thinks of himself as a competent director of actors without any visible evidence. Wahlberg often convincing as a stalwart lumpen hero must spend half the film fretting over his daughters choice of beau. Peltz is the generic blonde around only to get into trouble -- here by alien abduction. John Goodman Ken Watanabe John DiMaggio and Reno Wilson have fun voicing the ""Dirty Foursome"" of Autobots summoned by Optimus but they never escape the cage of comic stereotyping. And Tucci playing a sleazier Tony Stark is forever spuming the orders and insults of an undersize bully. As the acid-tongued Addison DeWitt says in All About Eve hes too short for those gestures. (READ How Bay and Wahlberg meshed on their movie Pain amp; Gain) Trans4mers which has plenty of stupid moments early on -- as in the depiction of the U.S. Presidents chief of staff (Thomas Lennon) whose cluelessness is meant to amuse but only baffles -- really soars into idiocy in its third act set in Hong Kong. We learn that Joshua possesses an ultimate weapon known as the Seed which he lugs around in a bag like a frequent flyers oversize carry-on luggage with say a small heavy corpse inside. When Joshua and his Chinese contact (Li Bingbing from Tsui Harks terrific Detective Dee) are fleeing pursuers they get in an elevator and no one thinks to press the top-floor button. The good guys are able to penetrate Lockdowns spaceship as they did Joshuas super-secret research lab because nobody thought to install security cameras. (READ Corliss on Li Bingbing in Tsui Harks Detective Dee) As everything is meant to race toward the conclusion Bay clutters the scene with some egregious product placement (for Bud Light Tom Ford Samsung the Pagani Huayra the Golden Palace Hotel). The final half-hour devolves into a kind of Abstract Expressionist chaos with commercials. Nothing coheres. Movies usually try to come together at the end; this one falls apart. If thats Bays intention then cinema has finally entered its Age of Extinction. Bay at his worst is like an attention-deficient kid banging his toy bots together in the basement rec room. You wonder what enormity he would have hatched with another Hasbro franchise Mr. Potato Head. Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

Photo Andrew Cooper Paramount Pictures Transformers Age of Extinction review Less than meets the eye 1 / 5 Back to Gallery Transformers Age of Extinction Action-adventure. Starring Mark Wahlberg Stanley Tucci Nicola Peltz and Kelsey Grammer. Directed by Michael Bay. (PG-13. 165 minutes.) Imagine if instead of creating new music a recording artist kept putting out the exact same album just playing the songs a little louder each time. Thats what it feels like watching ""Transformers Age of Extinction."" At this point four movies into the series making a new Transformers film is like an arms race taking place in an 11-year-olds imagination. The last Transformers movie blew up one city. Now were going to blow up two cities Transformers used to have one head. Make a two-headed Transformer How are we going to top the robot construction equipment in one of the previous films? Transformer dinosaurs This will all continue until director Michael Bay takes it too far and our universe collapses upon itself. Meanwhile the prospect of story coherence and pacing are already long gone swallowed up by the skyscraper-eating metal vacuum cleaner that seems to threaten the good guys in every one of Bays films. If you look at the most artistically successful big-budget sequels the characters continue to drive the narrative. Christopher Nolans Batman is emotionally spent and on the wrong side of the law. Han Solo is trapped in a block of carbonite and his friends are on the run. Khan wants to punish Kirk for the pain inflicted on his people. The human characters in ""Transformers Age of Extinction"" have no such motivations. After short establishing scenes sort out which of the three stereotypes they will inhabit (flawed good guy goofball sidekick or evil mastermind) they do nothing but run and fall down run and fall down occasionally interrupted by a slow-motion leap away from an explosion. The best moments are early in the film when the live-action scenes still outnumber the CGI goulash. Mark Wahlberg replaces Shia LaBeouf as the main protagonist a struggling Texas inventor named Cade Yeager who stumbles into the severely wounded body of good-guy Transformer leader Optimus Prime. We see that a secret wing of the U.S. government is hunting down and executing other Autobots with the help of a mercenary alien man-machine. Characters actually speak full sentences to each other until the setup ends with a very satisfying scene where Prime re-emerges to save the family farm. The first ""Transformers"" released in 2007 sustained that pace throughout the majority of the film and it was a good movie. But with the need to visually one-up the previous film storytelling in ""Transformers"" sequels always drops off a cliff in favor of spectacle. The actors become no more than action figures growing smaller and smaller in an increasingly busy landscape. Run. Fall. Slow-motion leap. Run. Fall. Slow-motion leap. Pause at the end to set up the sequel. There are problems from a hard-core geeks perspective as well namely that the Transformers no longer look like Transformers. It must seem like progress from the filmmakers point of view adding much more detail to the faces and smoother transformations from robot to vehicle. As a result the good and bad guy robots - especially the newer ones - look more like Terminators than Transformers. Unlike last years excellent-on-all-fronts giant-robot movie ""Pacific Rim"" the scale here looks all wrong. We save the worst news for last The new ""Transformers"" is a completely unnecessary and soul-crushing 165 minutes long bloated by exposition and plot turns that sound as if they were being made up as the movie was shot. You could cut 45 minutes out of ""Transformers Age of Extinction"" in completely random places; it would be a much better movie (and only slightly less coherent). I cant believe Im saying this out loud. But the ""Transformers"" film series is in desperate need of a reboot. Peter Hartlaub is The San Francisco Chronicles pop culture critic.

"Transformers Age of Extinction review 1.5 stars - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review Transformers Age of Extinction  1/2 Video Latest Transformers worth seeing only if your air conditioning breaks Chicago Tribune features reporter Chris Borrelli reviews the latest robot-infused action saga ""Transformers Age of Extinction"" and explains why it is so hard to love a Michael Bay film. Chicago Tribune features reporter Chris Borrelli reviews the latest robot-infused action saga ""Transformers Age of Extinction"" and explains why it is so hard to love a Michael Bay film. Christopher BorrelliContact Reporter ""Transformers Age of Extinction"" the fourth installment of Michael Bays 2.6-billion blue-chip franchise about a race of super robot freedom fighters that wear codpieces (to hide the junk under their trunk) and appear fundamentally incapable of not banging into stuff (even when these things are in an open field they find the one barn or tractor for miles around to collide with) is an aggressively charmless act of digital confetti. It is scattered weightless impossible to get hold of and somehow after seven years and more than 10 hours of screen time I could not tell you what these films are about. Explosions? Real estate? Lets say ""Transformers Age of Extinction"" is 165 minutes 11 minutes longer than the next longest installment (""Transformers Dark of the Moon"") 10 minutes shorter than that piece of trash ""The Godfather.""Even more so than skyscrapers losing sheets of windows and a pounding cacophonous insistence that doesnt even make the ""Transformers"" series all that fun to hate -- really no one is a bigger supporter of gigantic robots than myself -- time seems to be the defining characteristic here. For several reasons These films particularly ""Age of Extinction"" manage to come off as rushed long and empty all at once. Also Bays franchise which can be fascinatingly contradictory jingoistic and paranoid xenophobic and worldly has the air of a time capsule of our frenetic eager air-kissy confused techno-ubiquitous age. But even more so the ""Transformers"" films are about reminding you that time which stops while you are in a theater watching one is relative and whether you follow along or not there will be more Transformers movies coming. Oh yes. Forever.Transformers will bury us. Its no spoiler to point out for instance that this chapter ends with Optimus Prime long-winded leader of the nice robots (these things all pontificate the way you imagine a Civil War memorial might sound) soaring into space to continue the fight with someone or thing not especially obvious but apparently extremely important. Whatever franchise-extending plot-establishing mythologizing goes on in a ""Transformers"" movie tends to be an afterthought. In fact in mid-soar Optimus waxes philosophical There are mysteries of the universe and things unexplained. Oh I get it You are not supposed to understand what is happening in a ""Transformers"" movie only that it is happening. So when Stanley Tucci as a Steve Jobs-like billionaire building an army of bad Transformers that improve on legit Transformers says he thinks he should have enough Transformer stuff -- ""transformium"" I guess its called (seriously) -- to last the next 100 years the actor smirks ever so slightly.Bastard.But also kind of sweet one of a few moments when you feel Michael Bay -- who never can get a break from critics and whose films are distinctively chaotically admirably his own -- has a caustic sense of humor. Midway though ""Age of Extinction"" I realized I didnt know what was actually at stake. Extinction? I didnt know who was being chased by whom or who any of these people were so I looked to Mark Wahlbergs face for answers and laughed (too loudly) I realized Bay was playing a joke. By returning Wahlberg to his old pre-Oscar nomination face -- the expression of a man waiting for someone to finish talking -- he wastes the actor but lands his Tippi Hedren his place holder more or less.Because Bay not so unlike Alfred Hitchcock seems to have more allegiance to inserting a handful of familiar elements -- leveled cities unnecessary car chases American flags martial arts slo-mo stunts trench coats -- than actors or people. These Transformers protest a little too pointedly when they repeatedly ask ""Why should we care for these humans?"" Indeed ""Age of Extinction"" begins with the dinosaurs. They are quickly killed. Then the movie goes to the Arctic where robot dinosaurs are discovered (cool and given too little screen time). Then it goes to Texas -- aka""Texas USA"" as a title informs -- where we find Texan Wahlberg a nutty inventor type (I know I dont see it either) about to lose the family farm. Shia LaBeouf who starred in the first three films is nowhere to be found because his star power declined and the actor is never mentioned so the Transformers being kind of slutty shack up with Wahlberg who finds Optimus (disguised as a truck) in an old movie theater (actually the shuttered Uptown Theatre on Broadway). Optimus goes home with Wahlberg and explains that since the ""Battle of Chicago"" (that part in ""Dark of the Moon"" when you went deaf) good Transformers have been hunted by a rogue FBI (headed by a pretty good Kelsey Grammer). The president we learn is naive about the perceived threat of Transformers and Grammers character wants to vanquish robot immigrants. And sell their parts to Tucci. Except oh theres a bad robot who collects Transformers and wants no kidding to spread his ""seed"" around which I think means extinction or in the hands of Bay could be very different. I really dont know.Also demolition Lots of it. Chicago having been leveled in the third film is merely smashed this time. China which offers a burgeoning opportunity for Hollywood is banged around in the films final third. In particular Hong Kong is totaled while mainland China making a few contractually obligated appearances (the film has Chinese co-financiers and was allowed extensive shooting privileges) shows up primarily so that the bureaucratic authority figures can remind Chinese audiences (""Scramble the jets"") its central government will stand up to a Transformer threat.Anyway if youve seen a ""Transformers"" film you know this one Intended to relaunch the series with a new star and revitalized purpose -- the shadowy FBI storyline apparently -- Bay is the real star again As in his older blockbusters (""Armageddon"" the ""Bad Boys"" franchise) ones eyes never get a moment to relax. Sunsets grow oppressive. Im reminded of video games with similar visuals minus the visceral rush. (""Titanfall"" for Xbox one of 2014s best games stars big robots and is as graceful as ""Extinction"" is dull.) None of which should surprise of course.Whats disappointing is the lack of confidence. Its Bays world -- every professional female is British every building could be every other building -- but hes uneasy never relaxed enough to own the films ridiculousness. Instead characters quip ""You keep spending money on junk to make different junk"" and ""Out of ammo out of ideas."" And an air of self-hatred or disinterest settles in.

"Transformers Age of Extinction (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Transformers Age of Extinction (PG-13) Michael Bays latest installment in his giant-robot franchise is too much of a so-so thing. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com6/26/2014 Editor rating 2 Everything you learned in science class about dinosaurs turns out to have been wrong. The prehistoric creatures werent killed off by global warming or a meteor smashing into Earth In the opening minutes of Transformers Age of Extinction we learn it was Michael Bay and his computer-generated aliens who wiped the critters out. If the rest of this visually stunning technically impressive and crushingly dumb and overlong picture doesnt also quite kill off the cinematic art entirely at least it sends you home feeling like you wont be going back to a movie theater for a good while. To say that Age of Extinction is the best installment in the money-minting Transformers franchise is like saying the best episode of The Love Boat was the one that had Charo in it The praise is so faint its close to meaningless. Although Bay and screenwriter Ehren Kruger have swabbed the decks clean -- no more Shia LaBeouf no more soldiers standing around uselessly no more overacting by John Turturro -- some things remain the same such as the characters tendency to spout redundant dialogue that explains what youre seeing onscreen (""Its a big magnet thats sucking up metal and dropping it down again"") Some of the previous films which centered on the ongoing battle between the Autobots (the good Transformers) and the Decepticons (the bad ones) had plots so complex only viewers weaned on the 1980s TV cartoon could follow them. This time around Bay keeps the plot easy enough for an eight year-old newbie to understand. After Chicago was flattened in Transformers Dark of the Moon mankind decided to wage war on the giant alien machines capable of turning into cars building our own robots to hunt down the outsiders and exterminate them. But after Cade (Mark Wahlberg) a repairman and inventor in rural Texas with a teenage daughter (Nicola Peltz) allergic to pants buys an old tractor trailer he discovers the rig is actually Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen) the former leader of the Autobots badly wounded and in need of repair. One of the complaints leveled at the earlier Transformers movies is that it was hard to tell the robots apart so Bay makes them all distinct this time. Aside from Optimus theres the one that looks like a samurai the one that speaks with an Irish accent the one that sounds just like John Goodman and so on. The villains in Age of Extinction are the usual greedy billionaires (Stanley Tucci) and shady government types (Kelsey Grammer) out to make a fortune by stealing the alien technology and turning it into military weaponry. But just because we managed to wipe out all the Transformers on Earth doesnt mean there arent others drifting around the galaxy ready to drop in for a visit. The editing rhythm in Age of Extinction is noticeably slower than in the previous Transformers and Bay holds on shots longer this time You can actually tell whats happening when the machines tear into each other. Unlike LaBeouf who spent most of the first three movies running around underfoot trying not to get squashed Wahlberg still sporting his Pain and Gain biceps makes for a believable hero who can at least make a chink in the robots armor. Although Bay suddenly seems to be trying to top J.J. Abrams for the highest number of lens flares in a single movie the director pulls off some formidable setpieces such as a high-wire chase between our heroes and mechanical hyenas or some neat stuntwork in which Wahlberg flees from a baddie by rappelling down the windowsills and fire escapes of a Hong Kong tenement building. There are also of course at least 847 car chases because Bay just doesnt know when to quit His idea of entertainment is pummeling the audience unconscious and send you home reeling and worn out instead of tickled and energized. By the time the heroes are fleeing from dinosaur robots while an enormous spaceship is dropping an oceanliner on their heads and a tidal wave is bearing down Transformers Age of Extinction which runs close to three hours has sailed far past the point of overkill into sheer exhaustion. At least well have a couple of years to recover before Transformers 5 rumored to already be in pre-production stomps into theaters in 2017. Cant wait. Cast Mark Wahlberg Stanley Tucci Kelsey Grammer Nicola Peltz Jack Reynor Titus Welliver. Director Michael Bay. Screenwriter Ehren Kruger. A Paramount Pictures release. Running time 165 minutes.

Think about that. You could watch ""2001"" and still have four minutes left over. You could watch ""Gravity"" twice if you skipped the credits. You could probably read Isaac Asimovs ""I Robot"" cover to cover. Any one would be a better choice than spending two-and-three-quarter hours with ""Transformers Age of Extinction."" But these movies continue to make money for no easily discernable reason and so people continue to make them. And now here comes the latest minus the original stars but with old robo-truck Optimus Prime again leading the charge. Since we dont have Shia LeBeouf to kick around any longer the script also jettisons the other characters from the first three films to start fresh or as fresh as the fourth movie based on plastic toys and a bad cartoon series can be. This time weve got Mark Wahlberg putting his career in reverse to play an overprotective Texas pappy eking out a living as an eccentric inventor/Mr. Fixit with rage issues. Its been a few years since the last robo-pocalypse. A few surviving bots -- good guys and bad -- are being hunted down by the government. But then on one of his regular searches for interesting old junk Wahlberg wanders into an old movie theater. Its a promising start but dont get your hopes up; he is not going to discover a magic projector that will make any of what follows more watchable. No instead he finds an abandoned truck sitting amidst the orchestra section -- because where else would you find an abandoned truck except in a movie theaters orchestra section? And once he has it up and running it turns into old Optimus -- and tries to rally the few remaining Autobots so they can take on the Decepticons and the dangerous new enemy they face in... Oh whats the use? Ive read Chaucer in the original Middle English but I was never sure what was going on in this movie except that the government was evil the robots were fighting and Wahlberg got really angry whenever anybody looked at his 17-year-old daughter. Wahlberg is muscular and charismatic but the lines hes given sound like something Dirk Diggler would laugh at. In fact all the dialogue is pretty laughable. ""Wheres your warrant"" Wahlberg asks when the feds arrive at his home. ""My face is my warrant"" comes the answer. Wait... what? The rest of the cast includes Nicola Peltz as Wahlbergs increasingly spray-tanned daughter and Stanley Tucci as a sort of semi-evil Steve Jobs. Tucci is having fun as always but Kelsey Grammer seems to think hes playing the CIA chief in a serious movie. Thats a mistake. As for director Michael Bay - well he does what he always does which is to make every quiet shot look like a commercial. Trucks roll down dusty roads. People stare off into the orange sun. Flags flutter in the breeze. Its morning in America. N.J. NEWS ON THE GO Our redesigned mobile site has quick page loads and app-style navigation and lets you join the conversation with comments and social media. Visit NJ.com from any mobile browser. Of course in movies like this its also payday in China -- so like many modern blockbusters theres a not particularly essential shift in locale so that the last hour or so takes place there in hopes of selling even more tickets and sneaking in even more product placements. (Slipping in some regime-friendly propaganda too. When the mega-robots invade Hong Kong officials there immediately declare ""We must call the mainland"" Beijing responds with an immediate ""We must protect Hong Kong at all cost"" Yeah just one big happy.) But just when you think the whole movie is ready to wrap up -- giant spaceship heroes fighting back in a blur some male-bonding between Wahlberg and his daughters stupid boyfriend -- you realize with horror theres still another hour to go. So enter a whole new set of characters who look like mechanical dinosaurs (and who destroy things even more indiscriminately than the rock-em sock-em robots did). Plus a completely random kung-fu fight (again - gotta think about that Chinese market.) Although the bi-culturalism is kind of fitting though. Asia sends us their junk as toys. We repurpose that junk and send it back as movies. See? Recyling. Everybody wins. Except audiences. Transformers Age of Extinction (PG-13) Paramount (165 min.) Directed by Michael Bay.

(ILM/ Paramount Pictures) Joe Neumaier MOVIE CRITIC Thursday June 26 2014 1201 AM Title Transformers Age of Extinction Film Info With Mark Wahlberg Stanley Tucci Nicola Peltz Good and evil robot aliens who can become vehicles face off again. Director Michael Bay (245) PG-13 Violence language. In 3-D where available. Area theaters opening Thursday night. The fightin feudin rock-em-sock-em alien robots that resemble living construction sites are back as clanky and catastrophic as ever. The fourth film in the toy-based movie series ""Transformers Age of Extinction"" adds a few new parts to the formula begun in 2007 by director Michael Bay whos helmed every entry. Here we have human-created evil Transformers Transformers that look like robot-y coyotes and Dinobots and Transformers that are more like metallic dinosaurs which might seem to kill the robot-to-vehicle point of the whole thing. But no matter. Good Autobot Optimus Prime is back discovered hiding out as a truck by new hero Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg) a blue-collar Texas inventor whose name evokes both a 4x4 truck and a can of beer. Mark Wahlberg is an upgrade over Shia LaBeouf. (ILM/ Paramount Pictures) By helping the noble Optimus Cade his teenage daughter Tessa (Nicola Peltz) and Tessas racecar-driving boyfriend Shane (Jack Reynor) put themselves in the middle of a battle a scientist (Stanley Tucci) working for a nasty Black Ops bully (Kelsey Grammer) has found the genome to the Transformers and inadvertently ""re-created"" the evil Megatron leader of the Decepticons. Megatron was destroyed three years ago in ""Dark of the Moon"" but here is used to create a new villain Galvetron. The heroes and baddies race each other from Chicago and Beijing to get ""The Seed"" a bomb-of-life-type alien device that was used billions of years ago to destroy Earths dinosaurs (and set the stage for the Dinobots). It results in lines like Galvetrons ""Go find my seed"" -- which doesnt help tamp down this movies already sky-high silly factor. Nicola Peltz is ready for her closeup but the humans are not the stars the CGI is. (Andrew Cooper/ Paramount Pictures) But thats the trade-off with the ""Transformers"" movies If youre not an 11-year-old boy or a grownup in the mood to feel like one the endless scenes provide only the occasional thrill of being able to shout ""Wow That-car-is-now-a-deep-voiced-robot."" In fact the action scenes as in the previous films are downright headache-inducing. Yes the Dinobots when they show up have a cool look though they resemble the alien serpent that chased Iron Man in the conclusion of ""The Avengers."" And Grammer has fun chewing his lines while Tucci roles his around in his mouth before spitting them out snappily. Wahlberg too is a more welcome hero than Shia LaBeouf who starred in the previous films yet here is blessedly nowhere to be seen. If the ""human scenes"" all reek of adolescent dialogue and dopey snark masquerading as character development its a toss-up if thats better or worse than seeing clattering collections of caliginous junk -- some voiced by John Goodman Ken Watanabe and Robert Foxworth -- sass each other before battling and flying about like so much space junk. (The two-hour 45-minute run time for what its worth clocks in at five minutes shorter than ""Saving Private Ryan."") Its that kind of brain strain that if one isnt already a kid or a fan puts the stink in ""Extinction.""

Photo Andrew Cooper/Paramount Pictures MOVIE REVIEW Transformers Age of Extinction Decepti-yawn Running time 165 minutes. Rated PG-13 (profanity action violence). At the Empire the Kips Bay the Union Square others You get the feeling the guy who wrote ""Transformers Age of Extinction"" used the entire script as a passive-aggressive running joke on his boss director Michael Bay. There are lines like ""You have no soul"" ""Its been sucky around here lately"" ""Lets try to use violence as a last resort"" (said just before a random outburst of stabbing). And ""Im out of ammo. Im out of ideas."" Well not ammo. Never ammo. Loud ridiculous and nonsensical -- even for a Transformers movie -- episode 4 reboots with new characters. Mark Wahlberg is crackpot inventor Cade Yeager who discovers his beat-up truck is actually Optimus Prime the mighty blue-eyed leader of the good Transformers. His daughter -- Blondimus Prime played by Nicola Peltz -- is a sultry teen whose panting boyfriend (Jack Reynor) makes Daddy seethe. Optimus and his fellow Autobots are in hiding while an evil CIA chief (Kelsey Grammer) has joined forces with a Steve Jobs-like techno-jerk (Stanley Tucci) to replicate the Transformers metal (Transformium natch) in pursuit of huge profits and to create a robot army to protect the homeland. Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg) climbs on what we can only assume is a dormant Optimus Prime.Photo Andrew Cooper/Paramount Pictures The CIA doesnt trust the alien race even the good guys among them which leads to a lot of nudge-nudge talk about unwelcome immigrants. The company and the Company get a bit flustered when they learn their custom-built Transformer clone turns out to be harder to control than say your average iPad. Meanwhile the humans have to deal with a variety of death-defying situations like shimmying down wires strung between the tops of skyscrapers dodging the girder-like fists of angry Decepticons and driving GM cars. Scrambling from rural Texas to a sleek techno-fabulous HQ to the skies of Chicago to Hong Kong ""T4"" can never decide from one moment to the next whether to go scary or jokey -- ""Dark Knight"" or ""Looney Tunes."" The humans are so irrelevant -- rag dolls in the hands of the giant city-smashing robots -- this seems like the moment the Michael Bay Blockbusterbot became self-aware. With a lurch the blockbuster software shifts us to China or throws in some Bud Light (gotta pay the bills) without worrying much about making sense. Technologically superior beings are too dumb to notice humans have sneaked aboard their mother ship picking up large guns seemingly placed for their convenience and Prime saddles up a dino-bot and rides him around Hong Kong just because. Too rarely theres ironic wit as when Cade having survived two hours of battles with intergalactic super-alien robots is nearly killed by a falling air conditioner. This series was never good but it was once fun or at least flashy. Now that its gears have gone rusty its time for an ""Alien vs. Predator""-style rethink. Its lucky that Hasbro owns other properties. How about ""Transformers Vs. My Little Pony""?

This fourquel is hardly an anonymous product however it bears the trademark of director Michael Bay through and through. Whether or not thats a plus is up to you. See video Transformers Age of Extinction Payoff Trailer Mark Wahlberg Finds Optimus Prime (Video) Unlike the earliest of Bays mega-budget adaptations of the popular Hasbro toys ""Age of Extinction"" features visually coherent giant robots; we can tell where Optimus Primes fist ends and Lockdowns jaw begins and thats still a big step up for this franchise. At the same time however these vivid CG creations are still adrift in Bays cognitively dissonant editing lost amidst the visual flotsam that leaves us baffled as to who is fighting where and why and with whom. After whining his way through the previous installment Shia LaBeoufs Sam Witwicky has been sent packing with no explanation. ""Age of Extinction"" begins with CIA black ops teams hunting down the remaining Autobots despite the fact that these good-guy Transformers have now thrice saved the earth from annihilation. Pulling the strings in the background is Lockdown (voiced by Mark Ryan) whos obsessed with finding Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen). CIA shadow chief Harold Attinger (Kelsey Grammer) talks about ""aliens"" like an anti-immigration Tea Partier and exploits the destruction of Chicago in ""Transformers Dark of the Moon"" to stoke the publics fear of terrorism but Ehren Kruegers screenplay doesnt have anything to say about either of these timely topics it just throws them in as a way to make the film seem relevant. Heck when the action makes it to Chicago midway through the movie the Windy City doesnt look any the worse for wear despite all the talk about the havoc wreaked in the previous Autobot-Decepticon battle. Meanwhile in rural Texas unsuccessful inventor and widowed dad Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg) and his goofball assistant Lucas (T.J. Miller) go on a scrap run and come home with what appears to be an old truck that is actually Optimus Prime badly wounded in battle. Stung by humanitys betrayal O.P. wants nothing to do with us but Cade nonetheless helps get him back into working order. Also read Will Transformers 4s Nearly 3-Hour Run Time Cut Into Box Office? The CIA gets wind of Optimus Primes whereabouts and comes after Cade Lucas and Cades sheltered daughter Tessa (Nicola Peltz ""Bates Motel"") and the three are luckily rescued by Shane (Jack Reynor ""What Richard Did"") who is unbeknownst to Cade Tessas boyfriend. (For those playing along at home thats South Bostons Wahlberg surfer-dude Miller and the very Irish Reynor all playing alleged Texans. This movie desperately needs an infusion of Margo Martindale or Beth Grant or anyone with a remotely convincing twang.) Then its chase chase conspiracy explosion twist deathtrap capture escape ka-blam ka-blowie. While ""Age of Extinction"" offers up any number of potentially thrilling moments -- from our human leads flying through the air during a ""Fast and Furious""-esque highway chase to the sight of Optimus Prime on the back on a robot dinosaur -- the film suffers from the usual migraine-inducing editing (looking at you Roger Barton William Goldenberg and Paul Rubell even if you were just following orders) that renders all of Bays cinematic output so singularly unwatchable. Also read Transformers 4 Will Hit Theaters as Chinese Sponsor Controversy Reaches Resolution Even with all this cutting ""Age of Extinction"" lasts a posterior-punishing 165 minutes which is a lot of time to spend watching Wahlberg give his most embarrassing performance since ""The Happening"" Peltz becoming another in the franchises series of pneumatic sex-doll heroines and Stanley Tucci as a Steve Jobs type who yells things like ""Algorithms Math"" at his underlings. Throw in the usual dollops of macho posturing (Cade and Shane fight over Tessa until they finally bond over firing big guns together) casual racism and sexism (the women here are either slinky supermodels overweight caricatures or annoying senior citizens) and you have yourself yet another ""Transformers"" money-making machine. Its no doubt going to be good for business but its yet another paper-cut on the soul of the movies. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Daily Edition Login to download Transformers Age of Extinction Film Review 900 AM PDT 6/22/2014 by Clarence Tsui FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS Occasional glimpses of hope for a fresh reboot are extinguished by a generally bloated and dull spectacle. TWITTER Mark Wahlberg and Stanley Tucci head a completely new (human) cast in Michael Bays fourth installment of the intergalactic robot film series. ""The age of the Transformers is over"" announces counterintelligence agent Harold Attinger (Kelsey Grammer) in the fourth entry of the Paramount/Hasbro-backed fighting-robots film series. But dont you believe it Hes the villain of the piece and given Paramounts recent announcement that a fifth installment will ship in 2016 its clear the mutating androids reign onscreen and at the box office is far from finished. Some viewers though will probably side with Attinger as they leave theaters after Transformers Age of Extinction finally draws to a close. True theres a lot of state-of-the-art 3D chicanery and the film is a marked improvement over the wholesale inhuman chaos of the last two installments 2009s Revenge of the Fallen and 2011s Dark of the Moon. But the bloat of this latest entry -- at 165 minutes the longest of the lot -- suggests that Michael Bay and his team are struggling to rejuvenate the whole premise. PHOTOS Transformers Hong Kong Premiere Despite boasting an entirely new human cast and many a new onscreen mechanical warrior plus a half-hour grand finale set in very different Hong Kong locales Transformers Age of Extinction isnt the breath of fresh air vitally needed by an aging franchise. No matter that these films set the tills ringing -- all things come to an end and if this is a reboot Extinction promises the series will go out with more of a whimper than a bang further down the line. Still the current film is very well-placed to rake it in big time in China and could surpass Dark of the Moons record takings. Sadly Age of Extinction is neither controversial nor disturbing but mostly just dull and middling -- which is just so not done with a sci-fi action blockbuster designed to blast and titillate. It has neither the first films sporadic comedic pleasures born of the interactions between its humans and robots nor does it attain the hyper-sensationalism that makes the second and third installments utterly over-the-top showcases of gratuitous demolition. Its perhaps not a good sign that Ehren Krugers screenplay is laced with a slew of ironic self-reflexive gags about the films premise and its director. In an early scene a former cinema operator laments how ""crap"" sequels bring disrepute and ruin to the business; later a camera-wielding geek is heard dissing Armageddon -- one of the hits that cemented Bays standing as an ace in unleashing onscreen mayhem. Such attempts at whipping up a cheap laugh reflect a lack of confidence in the film overall. In the same way the script aims for kudos in its allusions to John Ford when the honorable robots team up in iconic Monument Valley and Stanley Kubrick when in the opening scene a prehistoric dinosaur-populated Earth is visited -- and decimated -- by a phalanx of alien warships. PHOTOS Mark Wahlbergs Road From Movie Star to Mogul Though converging fanboys may not tune in to The Searchers or 2001 A Space Odyssey homages they should connect to the broad sentiments shaping Age of Extinction that times (in the U.S. at least) are tough the government is bad and men (and only men) should fight for their heath home and automobile. All this is embodied in Bays new protagonist Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg). Unlike the middle-class suburban Sam Witwicky -- whose mix-up with the Transformers began when he bought a flashy car to fish for a hot date -- Cade is a broke Texan who gets into trouble buying a patched-up truck he intends to dismantle and sell off to pay the rent and future college fees of his daughter Tessa (Nicola Peltz). But the vehicle is none other than Optimus Prime (again voiced by Peter Cullen) the leader of the Autobots. Set several years after Dark of the Moon in which the Decepticons were defeated by the human-robot alliance Optimus and his world-saving colleagues have been shunned by those in power for being a threat. They are hunted down by Black Ops squadrons led by Attinger and Captain Savoy (Titus Welliver) not to mention the harrowing Decepticon bounty hunter Lockdown (voiced by Mark Ryan). Their patriotic veneer naturally conceals a darker motive -- they are hocking parts of the captured robots to Joshua Joyce (Stanley Tucci) a Steve Jobs-like egomaniac hoping to build ""better"" Transformers. What follows is a de rigueur runaround as the good guys (with Tessa now joined by her race car-driver boyfriend Shane played by Jack Reynor) are caught and freed a couple of times in the midst of screaming and carnage. They then travel to Hong Kong where they join their robot friends in pursuit of Joyce and his dangerous energy source. Being the only character whose personality arc actually changes within the film Tucci is given a wealth of opportunities to ham it up just like John Turturro John Malkovich and Frances McDormand have done before; his clownish antics while racing for survival in a Hong Kong tenement block are probably the highlight of the film. Unfortunately Wahlberg is given far less space to maneuver. His troubled interactions with Tessa and barbed exchanges with Shane are cliched or underwritten and his ability to morph into a bazooka-wielding warrior (""This alien gun can really kick ass"") limits his register further. Maybe its no surprise that the robots keep asking each other why they should care about these silly humans. The clatter of metallic mano a mano remains Bays calling card while the robot dialogue (from the good guys at that) includes lines like ""Die bitch"" or ""This ones for you A-hole"" as they cannonade their targets into well extinction. PHOTOS Most Anticipated Summer Blockbusters of 2014 Even when the action switches to Hong Kong -- a twist designed to qualify the film for Chinese co-production status and a bigger slice of the Asian box-office pie -- the noise never abates. Though basically superfluous the last 40 minutes of the film should please the Chinese co-financiers including the state-owned China Movie Channel as well as the authorities. For a change there are no Chinese villains and the one significant local character Joyces English-speaking deputy Su Yueming (Li Bingbing Resident Evil Retribution) is presented as a swish executive and a dexterous fighter who saves her American boss. The fictional Chinese defense minister can also be heard proclaiming the countrys ability to protect Hong Kong as he promises to send fighter jets to the city in a show of Beijings military might. True the film never actually shows the jets being dispatched to fight Age of Extinction is like all the other Transformers films not about details but about the grand scheme of things. Its grandiose mission statement is ""The biggest robots fighting the biggest fights"" -- and it does the job by reducing everything to a drone. Aurally Steve Jablonskys nearly omnipresent musical score merges with the sounds of CGI pyrotechnics in one giant cacophony. Visually the product placements eventually begin to blur and not even the glimpse of a Chinese banks ATM in the middle of Texas or the meaningless scene of Joyce drinking a Chinese soft drink while being pursued by deadly killing machines comes as much of a surprise. Belying its ominous title Age of Extinction barely skirts the idea that humankind and planet Earth are about to be totally annihilated. What is extinguished is the audiences consciousness after being bombarded for nearly three hours with overwrought emotions (""Theres a missile in the living room"" Tessa hollers -- twice) bad one-liners and battles that rarely rise above the banal. A trio of editors make a technical marvel out of the fight scenes but can do little to link the storys multiple threads into something coherent.

Its not just that the Autobots look more distinctive and easier to tell apart than ever in ""Transformers Age of Extinction"" -- as Optimus Prime never tires of reminding us these robots have actual souls. So who cares if the human characters are even more dispensable and the plot even more scattershot than usual? Resurrected to take on man-made knock-offs of themselves these metallic superheroes cause so much destruction its as if theyre trying to find a literal new definition for the term ""blockbuster"" -- and indeed as in the 2007-11 trilogy which raked in 2.6 billion globally helmer Michael Bay continues to evolve ways to make robotic shape-shifting look increasingly seamless and realistic in 3D. Extensive location shooting in Hong Kong and China provides a colorful new battlefield as well as an opportunity to cash in on the franchises second most lucrative market and boffo B.O. is expected globally following the pics world premiere in Hong Kong and its public unveiling at the Shanghai Film Festival. Set to be released in 2D 3D and Imax 3D worldwide the 165 million mega-production will reportedly kickstart a brand-new trilogy with a complete change of human cast (Mark Wahlberg steps in for Shia LaBeouf here) and the introduction of a new species the Dinobots which may have some crossover appeal for fans of another soon-to-be-rebooted franchise ""Jurassic Park."" Paramount is eyeing especially sky-high returns in China where ""Transformers Dark of the Moon"" is the fourth highest-grossing film of all time with nearly 180 million and where ""Age of Extinction"" received mainland production assistance from 1905 (Beijing) Network Technology Co. China Movie Channel and Jiaflix Enterprises. Still its Hong Kong that gets the lions share of the attention onscreen taking up about 30 minutes of the films 165-minute running time (a franchise record). The plot as scripted by Ehren Kruger (who penned the last two ""Transformers"" movies) bears more than a passing resemblance to that of the recent ""X-Men Days of Future Past."" Just as the X-Men are hunted by Sentinels engineered by a paranoid government using mutant DNA so the Autobots after siding with humans in an apocalyptic clash against the evil Decepticons are being targeted for elimination by a second generation of human-designed Transformers. The project is spearheaded by FBI agent Harold Attinger (Kelsey Grammer) whos commissioned tech corp KSI founded by Joshua Joyce (Stanley Tucci) to do the Ramp;D using the severed head of Decepticon leader Megatron as a blueprint. SEE ALSO Review Transformers Dark of the Moon At a Texas movie theater marked for demolition (no doubt a nod to the end of cinema as we know it) A.I. hobbyist and widower Cade Yeager (Wahlberg) discovers a rusty old truck among a pile of film cans and brings it home much to the chagrin of his 17-year-old daughter Tessa (Nicola Peltz ""Bates Motel"") and his assistant Lucas (T.J. Miller). When the vehicle reveals its identity as Optimus Prime (again voiced by Peter Cullen) the strongest of the Autobots Yeager fixes up his injuries while Lucas runs off to report him for a reward. Attinger dispatches his henchmen forcing Yeager Tessa and Optimus Prime to go on the run. Its nearly 40 minutes into the pic before Optimus Prime gets into a proper fight with a man-made Transformer and this is preceded by a no less confrontational scenario when Yeager meets Tessas professional race-car driver beau Shane (Jack Reynor). The affectionate bickering among the nerdy but overprotective dad his bossy bombshell daughter and her hot-headed b.f. feels like a warm-up act before the rock stars come onstage. That happens when in classic Western fashion Optimus Prime summons the surviving Autobots -- Bumblebee Ratchet (Robert Foxworth) Hound (John Goodman) Drift (Ken Watanabe) Crosshairs (John DiMaggio) and later Brains (Reno Wilson) -- to form his own Magnificent Seven. Bay really lets rip when the Autobots with the help of their human allies break into KSI Headquarters in Chicago ground zero in the previous installment. Its an exhilarating sequence in which two man-made Transformers Stinger and Galvatron (Frank Welker) slug it out with the good bots. When a spaceship enters the fray the story goes into quasi-biblical mode with talk of a ""Creator"" and an all-important ""seed"" replacing the Allspark as the MacGuffin here. SEE ALSO Review Transformers Revenge of the Fallen While the Chinese element is certainly generating buzz prior to the films theatrical release the third leg of the pic is all over the map geographically and structurally. Joyce is supposed to head to his branch operation in southern Guangzhou but Chinese audiences will recognize random shots of Beijing mixed in with footage of the South China Karst the much-touted Unesco World Heritage site in Chongqing (this lasts all but a few minutes). Then Joyce and his beautiful regional manager Su Yueming (Li Bingbing) beam down to Hong Kong and end up in a ludicrous elevator sequence that confirms the stereotype that every Chinese (or Asian for that matter) is a kung fu master. Once all the characters converge in Hong Kong however the stage is set for an epic showdown that proves well worth the not-inconsiderable wait. Though ""Pacific Rim"" beat ""Age of Extinction"" to location shooting in the former British colony the lurid images Guillermo del Toro served up made the ultra-modern city look like Chinatown. Kudos to Bay then (despite the surreally ubiquitous lanterns) for capturing the citys gleaming high-rises and seedy alleyways with lively verisimilitude. In several scenes the dull rusty hues of the man-made Transformers blend especially well with the grimy tenements which resemble stacks of matchboxes. Theres even one stunt that may or may not be a reference to an incident that took place during production when local gangsters demanding a ""turf fee"" reportedly threw an air conditioner at Bay (an indefensible act nonetheless in keeping with the spirit of the franchises electrical-appliance fetish). As the sine qua non of the franchise its the robots -- endowed here with character-rich physicality and almost human-scaled facial features -- who give the film its emotional heft. Optimus Primes charismatic leadership of his team as well as his unwavering compassion for the humans again makes him the movies moral anchor. Drift with his samurai getup and Watanabes dignified line readings strikes a neat balance with Goodmans cigar-chewing wisecracking Hound. Still the character most likely to be beloved by audiences especially tykes remains Bumblebee whose mischievous personality brings much-needed comic relief. Among the human actors only Tucci (suggesting a cross between a mad scientist and a tax collector) has any sort of character arc as he subtly evolves from a snarky comic role to a more fully fleshed-out character with a conscience. Li whose appearance has been highly anticipated in China oozes sex appeal while projecting a strong image as a hard-assed career woman but her role sadly limits her to a few angry or stressed-out expressions. Industrial Light amp; Magic again provides an orgy of visual effects and animation delivering lightning-fast acrobatic movements from the colossal Dinobots and conjuring the man-made Transformers from graceful cubic formations. While light rays and spots are noticeably blurry against pitch-black backdrops other 3D effects provide immersive experiences of large-scale destruction pelting the viewer with a beautiful confetti shower of splintered metal and exploding debris. The furiously mobile lensing by d.p. Amir Mokri (""Transformers Dark of the Moon"" ""Man of Steel"") making use of smaller digital Imax 3D cameras for the first time is even more tactile than before though it still tries to squeeze too much into the frame. That visual overkill extends to even the shorter scenes of individual bot-to-bot combat and several haphazardly staged car chases appear to have been inserted to satisfy the auto lovers in the audience. The aggressive sensory assault is borne out by the breakneck editing of William Goldenberg Roger Barton and Paul Rubell and also by the score by Bays regular composer Steve Jablonsky which achieves a thundering majesty whenever the Autobots make a dramatic entrance but is otherwise drowned out by the din of the Dolby Atmos sound mix.

Lun says July 1 2014 at 714 pm Im very very love the film Reply Alan says June 29 2014 at 527 pm Thats world famous boxer Zou Shiming. He is trained by Freddie Roach... the same guy who trains Manny Pacquiao. He won gold metals for China in the Olympics in 2004 2008 and 2012 Personally I think its completely racist that you saw boxing and thought it was martial arts just because the dude was Asian. That is true racism. Reply Luke says June 29 2014 at 736 am Ratchet wasnt summoned by Optimus.... so it was more like the Magnificent Six. As for the movie I liked it for what it is a visual effect spectacle though I think it is the worst of the four. However there are some ridiculous moments where I just thought ""Optimus can _____? Why didnt he just do that before?"" Also there were many things that just seemed shoe-horned into the movie without adequate development or reason like the Dinobots. And the blatant product placement ticked me off a bit. Reply Jonathan says June 28 2014 at 508 am N the human made bot seems so strong with their special transform ability but they got crushed easily by auto bots doesnt make sense at all  50 vs few of them auto bots should all be destroy before Optimus reach them. Reply Jonathan says June 28 2014 at 506 am This movie is really bad  at the end optimas prime can just fly to space? Come on then why they need space ship Reply JoeyJ (JoeyJanderson) says June 28 2014 at 1234 am The third sucked w//o Megan. Now this one without Shia just doesnt make sense.. https//vidd.me/5Mx Reply MYPC says June 26 2014 at 1223 am I give it 5 out of 10. This film is not detail. e.g. 1. Dont know why the O Prime can fly at the end. 2. Dont know how can the O Prime suddenly got fixed. 3. Dont know how can the Lock down make a deal with human. I yawned 3 times during the fight. (even I was sitting at D-Box a moving chair.) People living in H.K. will think it is a comedy movie when looking at the scenes of H.K. which actually filmed in China. And lots unnecessary scenes like the Chinese Gov send aircraft to H.K. to protect H.K. Nevertheless thanks for filming in H.K. lots of creative ideas. Reply John says June 24 2014 at 617 pm These movies are not made for ""die hard"" fans there made to appeal to all ages Reply Neoracer Xox says June 24 2014 at 147 pm You guys get the movies you deserve Reboots and THIS. Reply John says June 24 2014 at 714 am Michal bay directed the movies he didnt write them and he dont give a damn what people say about his work plus for all those people criticizing him you will never make the money he has so its a win lose situation and the bay transformers are not meant to be a reboot of the g1 series they are two completely different universes and a quick thought the legendary Stephen Spielberg is the executive producer Reply Walter White says June 24 2014 at 117 am Its boringgggggg after 10 minutes film is boring slow .... there that acton scenes of raising the level ... but after a while its just as boring. When a side of his character that we do not care and written in a sheet of toilet paper scenario Reply Burrito Grande says June 23 2014 at 800 pm Hopefully with the success of this latest TF film someone will recognize that its time to make a film series based on Voltron. http//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltron Reply Trevor says June 23 2014 at 523 pm I really dont understand why these movies are hated so much. Theyve got great action great visual effects and if you think the stories and scripts are weak then you should go watch The Dark Knight Rises again. Ill be waiting Reply Jared says June 23 2014 at 812 pm The movies are hated on because it has what we the die-hard fans dont want. We dont want kissy-kissy scenes we dont want porno shots of girls Michael Bay was probably doing something naughty over in his room we dont want racist stereotypes trying to pass off as humor and we only want minimal human engagement. I am taking some of this from Screen Junkies ""How to Fix Transformers"" video and at the same time I am not I honestly think that a good chunk of the actors that were cast for the first three were crap. Shia LaBeouf kept stuttering and made the cliche enough lines seem even more cliche Megan Fox was only used as Ms. Hot Shot and had a similar deal with LaBeoufs acting and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley was the same as Fox. For the Transformers themselves I really would like to see more shots that arent 5 seconds long. If you look at some of the scenes from the Transformers films compare it to Pacific Rim and Pacific Rim wins. Because Pacific Rim actually let you see what the hell was going on. Its all over the place but I really hope they do well with Age of Extinction. I agree the visuals and action are superb and Mark Wahlberg should be in it but I know it wont be too well. If I had to do anything fire Michael Bay and hire Joss Whedon. He would give us the Transformers we want Reply Tracy says June 23 2014 at 742 am So basically theres zero character development a lot of cool CGI which is described as ""overkill""...and yet this reviewer gives the movie a positive review? No wonder the state of filmmaking has reached this level. And Hollywood will be scratching its head wondering what went wrong as theaters empty out and people run to their televisions for stories that actually mean something. Who would have thought that would be the case ten years ago? Reply mattinacan says June 23 2014 at 721 am ugh someone put Bay out of his misery already Reply Pete says June 23 2014 at 645 am So much snobbery regarding these TF films. These movies never aspired to be high art. The point is to make something exciting to make money. Its based on a toy commercial TV series after all. And to think some people have the nerve to treat people who do like the movies as if they are some lower form of humanity. Get over yourselves Reply Kenny says June 24 2014 at 705 am Nothing wrong with having bad tastes. Look at the commercial success of Grown Ups 2. They make these movies for people like you enjoy them. Reply Pete says June 24 2014 at 725 am Then I guess even my bad taste is selective. After watching the abhorrent Grown Ups 1 I couldnt even stomach the thought of watching the second film on TV. JJ says June 22 2014 at 802 pm This series is such crap. Enjoy the latest chapter dumbass moviegoers. Reply guitarpete987 says June 23 2014 at 647 am Amen Reply Chloe says June 22 2014 at 218 pm If this film is more about the robots than the humans then I say ""Its about time"" Look at the cartoon. TransFormers was always about the robots-their lives their history their desire for home. Who cares about the people? Reply Robert says June 22 2014 at 720 pm i agree with you Chloe if the movie its focusing more on the bots like the recent games and tv series im all for that Reply Micah J. Berman says June 22 2014 at 130 pm The critic while point well taken needs to stop with the op-ed and give us the facts. From what I gather this movie is far superior to the latter two of the series wed all be surprised Im sure if the film got anywhere near a fresh rating on RT. Still Im through with critics and their OP-ED pieces on the director (michael bay). This is about the movie not the directors past performance. Reply Christopher says June 22 2014 at 1026 am What a snob sprinkling few facts and lots of negative opinion. Ew. Reply Benedict Johnson says June 22 2014 at 953 am Michael Bay is the Nickelback of movies. Reply freeek says June 22 2014 at 325 pm Sounds great then. I love Nickelback Transformers 1 amp; 3. Reply Dave Brown says June 25 2014 at 1147 am Soooo....you basically just admitted that you really dont like movies or music. Yeah this is the movie for you. Its an unnecessary sequel. Its a remake of a cartoon show from the 80s. Its also based a cartoon thats sole purpose for existing was to sell toys And Nickelback really? Cmon At almost three hours Im out. If this thing was just under two hours I might indulge in some dumb-assery but this is not going to be the type of movie with themes characters or sweep that requires that running time. I hope it bombs and sends a message but it wont. I would be a very happy camper if I drive by a packed parking lot to a movie theater and hear only Nickelback blasting from the cars parking. Uggggggghhhhhhh...... Nancy P says June 22 2014 at 953 am Sounds just like the other films.....this series needs a proper reboot. Reply Prefer Movies With Humans says June 22 2014 at 455 pm This soulless franchise needs to end.
