Summit Entertainment From left Logan Lerman Luke Evans and Matthew Macfadyen in ""The Three Musketeers"" (Summit Entertainment) Summit Entertainment From left Ray Stevenson Matthew Macfadyen Logan Lerman and Luke Evans in ""The Three Musketeers"" (Summit Entertainment) Whatever your relationship to the Alexander Dumas story about Athos Porthos Aramis and the musketeer intern DArtagnan theres a word for the latest screen edition of ""The Three Musketeers"" whatthehell?Those who favored the callous aggravations of the recent Guy Ritchie-directed ""Sherlock Holmes"" a film without which ""The Three Musketeers"" would be unthinkable may forgive the grating chaotic brand of storytelling and filmmaking here. The director Paul W.S. Anderson brings to this costume party the same battering-ram sensibility he brought to ""Alien Versus Predator"" and the ""Resident Evil"" franchise. The 1844 Dumas adventure classic is now a steampunked migraine. Clashing swords purloined jewels and court intrigues no longer suffice. This movie exists for its digital airborne sailing vessels and retro-futuristic flamethrowers.Somewhere in there youll find a trio of cynical out-of-work musketeers the casualties of ""budget cuts"" as one of them notes early on. ""I thought youd all be a little more ... heroic"" says DArtagnan (Logan Lerman). Wrong movie These three are homicide machines or at least maiming machines given to slow-motion gamer-style ""kills."" Leonardo da Vinci we learn has drawn up plans for a deadly flying ""war machine"" a combination of dirigible and seafaring galleon. In the prologue Athos (Matthew Macfadyen) Aramis (Luke Evans) and Porthos (Ray Stevenson) sneak into Venice on a special-ops mission. Their accomplice is Milady de Winter(Milla Jovovich). Soon she betrays them allying herself with Cardinal Richelieu (Christoph Waltz) and the Duke of Buckingham (Orlando Bloom). Waltz snivels as Richelieu while Bloom lets the energy dribble away from his dialogue scenes. Not that director Anderson cares about dialogue. Rewatch the 1974 Richard Lester ""Three Musketeers."" It had little to do with Dumas but it had a spark to call its own. This latest version is ""le pits."" ""The Three Musketeers""One star (out of four)  Rating PG-13  Run time 142  Content Adventure action violence Videos Watch a trailer for The Three Musketeers Oct 20 2011 (...)

Anderson (Mortal Kombat the Resident Evil franchise) makes the not particularly natural jump in source material from video games to 19th-century French literature and the result is stupid fun with an emphasis on stupid. Everything in The Three Musketeers is puffed up absurdly -- from Orlando Blooms villainous pompadour to the plot about preventing war between France and England via a diamond heist -- until its like one of the airships that populate the film It floats but its mainly filled with hot air.

(Rolf Konow) Elizabeth Weitzman Monday October 24 2011 400 AM Title The Three Musketeers Action-adventure set in 17th century France. With Logan Lerman Milla Jovovich. Director Paul W.S. Anderson (150). PG-13 violence. At area theaters.No longer content to find his inspiration in video games (""Resident Evil"") and Seventies B-movies (""Death Race"") Paul W.S. Anderson has turned to the next logical source classic literature.English teachers will be rightfully appalled by Andersons irreverent approach to Alexandre Dumas novel but their students may be entertained by the rousing if boldly preposterous action herein.The characters remain (mostly) as they were when Dumas imagined them in 1844. But among all the ""Musketeers"" movies that have come along since this is surely the first to feature dueling dirigibles.Logan Lerman is our DArtagnan and if youre picturing Douglas Fairbanks -- or even Hugh Dancy -- think again. This aspiring warrior looks like hes on lunch break from his mall job and yet the mighty Athos (Matthew Macfadyen) Porthos (Ray Stevenson) and Aramis (Luke Evans) quickly welcome him as one of their own.The Musketeers do need some extra manpower. Their nemesis the Duke of Buckingham (Orlando Bloom) has enlisted Athos former love Milady (Milla Jovovich) to steal Da Vincis plans for a military airship. And while they have the favor of King Louis (a funny Freddie Fox) the scheming Cardinal Richelieu (Christoph Waltz) wants them in jail.Along with the obvious liberties you will find some original plot points here (a horse is insulted; jewels are stolen; fidelities betrayed). But while the story is familiar the spirit is not -- unless youve seen Andersons other equally high-octane works.Fortunately most of the cast and crew seem well aware of the films utter ridiculousness and play along with campy enthusiasm. Jovovich (Andersons real-life lady) does little more than pout in pretty clothes but Bloom is unusually relaxed and Waltz can always save a scene. And while Lerman is too callow for his role the other Musketeers are suitable swashbucklers.The absurdly anachronistic action is geared towards Anderson fans more accustomed to zombie fights but at least its energetic and intermittently amusing. And Id take good-natured inanity over mean-spirited cynicism -- like say Zack Snyders ""Sucker Punch"" -- any day. (Of course youll feel much more generous if you make the wise choice to pass on the 3D ticket.)That might sound like faint praise but by the end of this frenetic affair even the most liberal viewer is likely to echo Miladys thoughts of DArtagnan ""You are very amiable no doubt but you would be charming if you would only depart.""Magic Moment Those flying pirate ships are quite a sight.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet ""All for one and one for all"" goes the famous motto of Alexandre Dumas musketeers so its odd to see an adaptation of The Three Musketeers--yes another--so divided against itself. Directed by Paul W.S. Anderson (Death Race the Resident Evil series) this version of the Musketeers story cant decide if it wants to be an old-fashioned tale of swashbuckling adventure and palace intrigue or a cheeky effects-heavy rethink of some iconic characters a la the Guy Ritchie-directed Sherlock Holmes. So it tries to be both at once with annoying if hardly disastrous results. Luke Evans Ray Stevenson and Matthew Macfayden make for a sturdy central trio keeping the characters personalities intact even though theyve been re-imagined as gadget-toting 17th-century super-spies. But the briskly paced film never gives them much time to establish their famed rapport. Christoph Waltz an inspired choice for Richelieu meets a similar fate. Hes clearly relishing the chance to play the famous villain but Anderson doesnt give the audience much of an opportunity to relish his work. Instead the film spends much more time with its DArtagnan played by Percy Jackson star Logan Lerman as a cocky hard-to-like asshole. (If Lermans goal here was to establish himself as the first person to call when Shia LaBeouf turns down a part then mission accomplished.) Anderson regular Milla Jovovich rounds out the cast as the treacherous Milady whose skills with slow-motion Matrix-inspired derring-do rival the musketeers. Eventually the human factor stops mattering entirely as the film becomes dominated by CGI airships Da Vinci-derived weaponry and other additions Dumas would no doubt regret not thinking up himself none of them particularly thrilling or imaginatively rendered. In that sense theyre of a piece with the rest of the film. Beyond being unable to decide what kind of Musketeers movie it wants to be Andersons adaptation seems determined to underachieve as both heavy spectacle and light adventure. Its two mediocrities for the price of one. Share Tweet Filed Under Film More Movie Review Previous Movie Review Paranormal Activity 3 Next Movie Review Janie Jones Dont miss a story--follow The A.V.

Andersons version of The Three Musketeers is a wicked parody of the dumbed-down tarted-up literary adaptations that Hollywood is famous for. The modern dialogue the superhero-like physical abilities the utter abandonment of logic in favor of inane spectacle -- what a hilarious exaggeration of Hollywoods lowest-common-denominator mentality The only way the joke could have been driven home any better is if the film were called The Three Musketeers To the Exxtreme Ah but youll have to forgive me for I have employed sarcasm. In truth The Three Musketeers is not a parody of terrible movies; it is an actual terrible movie one that reinforces the stereotype that the way to get ahead in Hollywood is to come up with the stupidest ideas you can -- or better yet stupidize someone elses smart ideas -- and pour money on them. Picture a comedy sketch where some hack pitches his awful ideas to an eager studio executive ""Its The Three Musketeers but with high-tech gadgets and a mid-air battle between two dirigibles"" Its one of those fake bad movies that people joke about except that someone actually made it. Im genuinely surprised that none of the characters turns out to be a robot. I hardly know where to begin. I almost want to recommend that you watch it just so you can see firsthand how dazzlingly moronic it is how stupefyingly dumb. Unfortunately one of its myriad flaws is that it ends with a transparently cynical attempt to set up a sequel and I cannot in good conscience advise you to do anything that would encourage this. So if you want to see The Three Musketeers out of morbid curiosity or due to a chemical imbalance in your brain please do not pay for it. Using Alexandre Dumas novel the way a tobacco chewer uses a spittoon screenwriters Alex Litvak (Predators) and Andrew Davies create a version of early 17th-century Paris that is remarkably similar to early 21st-century Los Angeles in terms of peoples vocabularies accents and attitudes. Our noble musketeers -- romantic Athos (Matthew Macfadyen) clever Aramis (Luke Evans) and brawny Porthos (Ray Stevenson) -- are out of work ever since the evil Cardinal Richelieu (Christoph Waltz) gained the trust of the king and put his own army in charge of keeping the peace. Adding insult to injury the musketeers were double-crossed by the poisonous Milady de Winter (Milla Jovovich) who used them to break into Leonardo da Vincis secret vault and steal a design for a flying war machine then sold the plans to Englands Duke of Buckingham (Orlando Bloom). (Does Leonardos secret vault have ingenious locking mechanisms and elaborate booby traps that can only be thwarted by someone with the same physical powers as the woman from Resident Evil? You better believe it) Soon the lads are joined by DArtagnan (Logan Lerman) a smart-mouthed little bastard from the sticks who has come to Paris to be a musketeer. This cocky mannequin-headed punk immediately starts picking senseless fights with people like Rochefort (Mads Mikkelson) the head of Richelieus guard as well as the musketeers themselves. He seemed like such a nice kid when he bade his parents farewell but evidently the three-day journey to Paris turned him into an insufferable frat boy. He is the hero of the movie. Richelieu wants to provoke a war with England so that he can usurp power over a destabilized France. To that end he hires double agent Milady to plant evidence in London and Paris suggesting that Frances queen Anne (Juno Temple) is having an affair with Buckingham. Annes husband King Louis XIII (Freddie Fox) is a vapid teenager whose primary concern is dressing more fashionably than Buckingham and whose marriage to Anne was arranged for political reasons. Inexplicably Louis becomes friends with DArtagnan and seeks advice from him on how to gain the sincere affections of his queen. The entire film hinges on this one weird subplot. Well next thing you know Buckingham has built one of those Leonardo war machines and its a zeppelin and King Louis thinks its really cool. Due to a complicated series of dumb events DArtagnan and the musketeers must go to England break into the Tower of London commandeer the airship and have a fight with Rocheforts troops who it turns out ALSO have an airship because they hurried up and built one secretly while the four musketeers were crossing the Channel. Rocheforts zeppelin has been fashioned to look like a pirate ship complete with an enormous skeleton carved on the prow. And so on. Look its not that I think The Three Musketeers shouldnt be desecrated. Its an old book and its in French and what do I care? You want to add grappling hooks and razor wire and secret passageways and chubby comic relief characters and people being pooped on by birds and ornate flying machines that can be built in less than a week hey be my guest. All I ask is that you do it well. Paul W.S. Anderson who possesses technical skill but is a terrible storyteller doesnt do it well. He flings everything he can at this pile of garbage in a doomed effort to shape it into something coherent and fails utterly. Its no surprise that hes made a bad movie -- hes done it before (Death Race Mortal Kombat Alien vs. Predator) and will probably do it again -- but it is a little surprising how this one manages to be bad in so many different ways. This pointless ill-conceived brain-dead train wreck might supplant Battlefield Earth as societys favorite you-gotta-see-it-to-believe-it cinematic disaster. Nondescript characters flat acting bland dialogue contradictory plot points lethargic sword fights illogical motivations wasteful misuse of Christoph Waltz that damnable airship battle -- its all just so stupid so very very stupid. And every time you think it cant get any stupider it gets right up in your face calls you ""bro"" and gets stupider. The only thing that makes it stop getting stupider is that it finally ends and even then you can see it still struggling.

We should perhaps admire their restraint at not throwing in a rapping grandma and a wise-cracking chimp but its hard to give any credit to a movie thats this utterly pointless humorless charmless and needless. Im pretty sure I wasnt supposed to be wishing for the death of DArtagnan (Logan Lerman) at the hands of the evil Rochefort (Mads Mikkelsen) during their climactic rooftop battle. But then Im also pretty sure that I wasnt supposed to be wishing that I were instead watching ""Hudson Hawk"" a movie that seems downright restrained and narratively focused next to this one. The basic ""Musketeers"" story elements are in place Country hick DArtagnan comes to Paris to fight alongside Athos (Matthew Macfadyen) Porthos (Ray Stevenson) and Aramis (Luke Evans) who have seen better days -- the trio is beholden to young stupid King Louis XIII (Freddie Fox) but the real power in France is the devious Cardinal Richelieu (Christoph Waltz) who has plans to plunge the nation into a war with England so that he may seize the throne. But in the same way that Robert Zemeckis decided that ""A Christmas Carol"" was lacking a carriage chase with a teeny-tiny Scrooge or that the makers of last years ""Gullivers Travels"" realized that the Jonathan Swift classic was achingly devoid of a giant robot hack director Paul W.S. Anderson (""Resident Evil"" ""AVP Alien vs. Predator"") stuffs the screen with Indiana Jones-style deathtraps and enormous DaVinci!-inspired airships. Look just because people have been reading and loving Alexandre Dumas novel for more than 160 years why not bloat it with needless stuntwork and special effect gimcrackery? Rip off ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" to your hearts content filmmakers but leave poor Dumas out of it. Of course its not just the 19th century French author who bears the brunt of the abuse here -- the cast is unanimously ill-served by the material. Lets start with the vapid mush-mouthed Logan Lerman whos more Mousketeer than Musketeer. His shaggy-haired surfer-dude demeanor would be perfect for a Disney Channel ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" sitcom but its jarringly out of place here. Macfaydens Athos is meant to be cynical and disappointed after his betrayal at the hands of Milady DeWinter -- played by Milla Jovovich and more on her in a second -- but the emotion he tends to convey is what the young people call ""butt-hurt."" As for Jovovich shes trying to be terribly terribly wicked (and also a wall-crawling superspy in a bustle) but her performance finds a hitherto unknown middle ground between Divine in ""Pink Flamingos"" and Halle Berry in ""Catwoman"" thats just embarrassing. Miladys exaggerated dresses wear the actress and not vice versa an affliction that also befalls Jovovichs ""Dirty Girl"" co-star Juno Temple here reduced to a squeaky-voiced cipher as Queen Anne. Waltz apparently took on the role of Richelieu to prove that Supporting Actor Oscar winners are indeed cursed -- charming evil was his forte in ""Inglourious Basterds"" but in ""The Three Musketeers"" hes just phoning in some warmed-over Snidely Whiplash. Not that his hammy villainy can compete with the insanely over-the-top antics of Orlando Bloom as Lord Buckingham who camps it up like hes playing Captain Hook in one of those Christmastime British panto plays. I weep for those who will have their first exposure to this material by way of this bloated moronic mess of a movie. Pick up the book rent the unparalleled 1973 Richard Lester version -- heck even the old Classics Illustrated comic-book leaves this thing in the dust. On its own demerits ""The Three Musketeers"" is a soul-draining experience but as an adaptation of one of the definitive tales of derring-do its an argument against letting novels go into the public domain.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Oct. 21 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 240PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Swords cleavage and cannon balls Could it be that The Three Musketeers the latest of numerous films adapted from Alexandre Dumass 17th-century-set adventure novel can scavenge whatever remains of box-office booty the fading Pirates of the Caribbean franchise has left in its wake? That would seem to be the case with director Paul W.S. Andersons move to the classics after establishing himself as a specialist in horror and game adaptation ( Resident Evil Afterlife Mortal Kombat). Screen grab from the online trailer for the latest film incarnation of ""The Three Musketeers"" Movies The Three Musketeers The official trailer Not unexpectedly his movie opens with a board-game view of Europe before we descend into the action. This 3-D film which avoids explicit violence or sexuality seems aimed for a juvenile male audience who may enjoy ogling the steampunk anachronistic weapons or Milla Jovovichs occasional appearance in a saucy corset. Otherwise the main attraction is the films lavish-looking production values including CGI-painted backdrops pretty European castles and sparkly silk costumes which clothe the unknown or modestly familiar actors. The three musketeers of the title are introduced in mid-caper as they attempt to break into Leonardo da Vincis booby-trapped vault to steal his already-antique plans for a flying hot-air warship. The three include the moody leader Athos (Matthew Macfadyen) the cerebral former priest Aramis (Luke Evans) and the jocular strongman Porthos (Ray Stevenson). Helping them out is sexy trickster Milady de Winter (Jovovich) who as soon as the mission is accomplished takes off with the plans. From there on the script sticks fairly closely to the Dumas novel beginning with young DArtagnan (Logan Lerman) departing from his rural home on the family nag. Shortly after reaching Paris the hot-tempered youth manages to quarrel and schedule duels with all three of the famed musketeers. Instead he joins them in the movies first big fight against their rivals Cardinal Richelieus guard led by the eye-patch-wearing captain Rochefort (Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen). Richelieu is played by Christoph Waltz ( Inglourious Basterds) as another oily villain. He seeks to eliminate the musketeers the better to control the effete young King Louis (Freddie Fox). Hes aided in his plan by the treacherous Milady and an English fop the Duke of Buckingham (Orlando Bloom talking through his nose). Richelieu arranges to steal the Queens necklace to incite the jealous Louis to go to war with England. That threat sends DArtagnan and his new friends across the British Channel to steal the jewellery back. All the borderline pantomime acting and wigged buffoonery is deliberate and silly but The Three Musketeers remains charmless a romp brought down by its lead-footed script. Co-written by Alex Litvak ( Predators) and Andrew Davies ( Pride and Prejudice) the dialogue wavers between the unamusingly anachronistic (""Lovely outfit. Very retro"") and a painful attempt at courtly banter. It doesnt help that Lerner never seems anything other than a bland suburban-American teen or that his love interest the Queens maid Constance (Gabriella Wilde) seems wooden even before she gets tied to the prow of a ship. The trio of journeyman British actors who play the musketeers are a brusque reasonably appealing lot though they barely get enough screen time to know them. As the films conclusion makes clear that oversight is intended to be redressed in a sequel. No thanks. In this case ""One for all"" will do. The Three Musketeers Directed by Paul W.S.

Comments click to enlarge The Three Musketeers Video Rated PG-13  110 minutes  2011 Alexandre Dumas quintessential swashbuckler has inspired such fine adaptations as the rowdy 1921 version starring Douglas Fairbanks and the splendid The Three Musketeers (1973) and The Four Musketeers (1974) both directed by Richard Lester. But this one is overblown over-dressed and grandiosely dopey packed with gargantuan sets and ludicrous action scenes and shot in unusually dark and dingy 3-D. Teen dream Logan Lerman (Percy Jackson amp; the Olympians The Lightning Thief) plays DArtagnan as an arrogant frat boy and though he makes the musketeers (Matthew Macfadyen Ray Stevenson Luke Evans) look good by comparison the only real pleasure here is Christoph Waltz amusingly hammy as the wily Cardinal Richelieu. (Milla Jovovich as Milady offers pure action cheesecake.) The script is by Andrew Davies (Pride and Prejudice) the frenetic gimmicky direction by Paul W.S. Anderson (Mortal Kombat Resident Evil).

However while these flying galleons facilitate some eye-catching aerial battles the rest of the swashbuckling action is strictly for groundlings.Andersons acknowledged model was Richard Lesters 1973 version though he has opted to cast actors not stars. Logan Lerman and Orlando Bloom come across as neither. It is impossible to see how the insipid Lermans callow wannabe musketeer DArtagnan could help restore the mojos of Matthew Macfadyens love-lorn Athos Ray Stevensons larger-than-life Porthos and Luke Evanss jaded Aramis. Bloom is cast against type as the dastardly Duke of Buckingham but is acted off the screen by Milla Jovovich whose Milady de Winter uses her feminine wiles and fighting skills to survive in a mans world. Otherwise its one for all and all for nowt.

It is the first 3D film in quite a while where you actually feel you are getting your moneys worth for the extra cost of seeing a film whilst wearing 3D glasses. It is more than just a bit far fetched and the fight scenes and some 3D effects are a bit staged. You will get to enjoy the slow mo fights and the styleised violence. Without the 3D it would struggle to make 3 stars but with the 3D effects its worthy of 4. On the downside the script is pretty standard fare on the plus side theres lots of Milla Jovovich in a corset stockings and heels. Overall easy on the brain and easy on the eye.

TWITTER Director Paul W.S. Anderson takes a break from fantasy to have a go at one of the most filmed stories of western literature The Three Musketeers which stars Logan Lerman Milla Jovovich and Orlando Bloom. SAN SEBASTIAN -- Of the 20-plus adaptations of Alexandre Dumas 1844 best-seller Paul W.S. AndersonsThe Three Musketeers may be the biggest budgeted of the bunch but is mainly notable for being the first 3D version of the tale. A fantastical Pirates of the Caribbean vibe is somewhat incongruously grafted on to what has always been a decidedly earthbound tale of sword-play and derring-do in early 18th-century Europe and while the strength of this long-established cultural brand remains potent its unlikely to translate into a money-spinning franchise along Pirate lines. This German-French-British co-production was shot in Germany and topped the box office there for two weeks in early September. A softish opening of 3.4 million -- on a notably sunny weekend -- was followed by a smaller-than-average decline of 13% indicating positive word-of-mouth for this undemanding if noisy romp aimed principally at a young male audience. This first period picture from Paul W.S. Anderson a director whos established a following in the futuristic and fantasy genres with various Resident Evil forays features an American Logan Lerman in the lead with a European supporting cast. It looks a safer prospect at international box offices than in North America where it may prove the latest example of 3D fatigue when it opens October 21 from Summit Entertainment. PHOTOS First Look at The Three Musketeers Scriptwriters Alex Litvak andAndrew Daviesat times adhere quite closely to Dumass original narrative at least in the first half as peasant lad DArtagnan (Lerman) travels to Paris with the aim of becoming a Musketeer one of the elite guard sworn to protect the throne of France currently occupied by the boyish vapid Louis (Freddie Fox). In double-quick time he bumps into and antagonizes the three most famous musketeers the swaggeringly sardonic Athos (Matthew McFadyen) the no-nonsense Porthos (Ray Stevenson) and the guileful Aramis (Luke Evans). After some initial very cursory frictions he joins forces with them just as they are being plunged into pan-European intrigues involving dastardly Englishman Buckingham (Orlando Bloom) and King Louiss right-hand man the devious and ambitious Cardinal Richelieu (Christoph Waltz). A wild-card element is provided by Milady DeWinter (Milla Jovovich) a former colleague of the musketeers -- and a former lover of Athos -- who is now plotting with their enemies for her own gain. VIDEO The Three Musketeers Trailer Lively channel-hopping shenanigans duly ensue the perfidious Brits gaining an initial technological advantage thanks to flying boats constructed in one of the films few neat historical asides from stolen Leonardo Da Vinci plans. These unlikely vessels are underwhelming affairs lacking the loopy grandeur of the similar conveyance devised three decades ago by Terry Gilliam for Time Bandits and raising unflattering memories of the Pirates pictures. Those films made a romantic lead out of Bloom who now cuts a dashing but unmenacing figure as one of the pictures multiple villains alongside Waltz Jovovich and an eye patch-sporting Mads Mikkelsenas the leader of Richelieus guards. Jovovich gets a couple of elaborate action sequences which nod back to her Resident Evil adventures. This time her death-defying slow-motion gymnastics take place in Pierre-Yves Gayrauds elaborate scene-stealing period costumes. Otherwise few in the promising cast register much of an impact. Lerman makes for a distinctly bland lead. DArtagnans romance with damsel-in-distress Constance (Gabriella Wilde) is all too lukewarm as the hero sounds and acts more like a 21st-century American teen than a swordsman of bygone Europe. Hes the uninspiring center of a picture largely content to recycle established action-movie stunts while bringing very little new to the table including an unimaginative deployment of 3D effects. Rather like Ridley Scotts Robin Hood Andersons picture ends just as its story should really be kicking into life - theres an unmistakable and frustrating end of part one mood to the final sequence though making this ending so open and sequel-ready may turn out to be over-optimistic.

With its airborne CGI galleons 3D format and an armed Milady who hides rappelling equipment beneath her corset helmer Paul W. S. Andersons version of ""The Three Musketeers"" is a very 2011 take on Alexandre Dumas classic that feels weirdly dated already. Although adequately entertaining thanks to lavish production values and game supporting perfs this anodyne adaptation lacks a killer hook that would help it cross over to a demographic beyond action buffs and fanboys. Canny calendar positioning should help Summits October release Stateside but the pic will swash more buckle overseas where the title has more cachet. Already open in Germany ""Musketeers"" screens Sept. 23 at the San Sebastian Film Festival. Not too long ago it looked as though this American-German-French-British co-production would be one of two new 3D adaptations of ""Three Musketeers"" this year alongside Warner Bros. Doug Liman-helmed version. Whatever the reasons that project was put on hold one cant help but wonder if there might have been well-founded doubts about how well Dumas 17th century-set tale of chivalry camaraderie and courtly intrigue could be remixed for contempo auds without diluting it beyond all recognition. Indeed the script here struggles to find a balance between the sensibilities of Alex Litvak best known for writing ""Grayskull"" and ""Predators"" and Andrew Davies who built his rep on tony literary adaptations for British TV such as ""Pride and Prejudice"" (1995) and ""Little Dorrit"" (2008). End product lacks Davies signature verbal sparkle Davies but also sags in the middle the way a mainstream action film shouldnt when it bogs down in all the business about the Queens purloined necklace (ironically the bit closest to Dumas novel). The opening sequence offers a typical example of how far beyond Dumas the filmmakers are willing to go as the Musketeers soldiers in the employ of Frances King Louis (Freddie Fox) are introduced on a secret mission to Venice to snatch plans drawn up by Leonardo Da Vinci for an airship. Joining leader Athos (Matthew Macfadyen) enigmatic ex-priest Aramis (Luke Evans) and jovial muscleman Porthos (Ray Stevenson) on this quest is none other than Milady de Winter herself (Milla Jovovich Andersons regular muse) not just a pretty face and a cunning mind but also a dab hand with a sword and a roundhouse kick. Unfortunately Milady betrays them as shes secretly in cahoots with Cardinal Richelieu (Christoph Waltz good but somewhat lazily cast as yet another smooth villain). This leaves Athos particularly embittered by the time young idealistic Justin Bieber-haired upstart DArtagnan (Logan Lerman) arrives in Paris sometime later from the sticks keen to become a Musketeer himself. Richard Lesters ""Three Musketeers"" (1973) and ""Four Musketeers"" (1974) made their own significant departures from the books as nearly every film version has but they had a bawdy streak thats notably lacking in this very teen-skewed PG-13 incarnation. Louis for example is a moon-faced kid basically suffering from a crush on his own wife (Juno Temple a delight as usual) while DArtagnan gives him brotherly dating advice. Orlando Bloom plays the Duke of Buckingham like a rival jock from another school sneering over Louis out-of-fashion duds. For an action film theres an awful lot of foppish discussion about clothes going on. But what glorious clothes they are. Pierre-Yves Gayrauds exquisitely detailed outfits steal scene after scene in particular the womens gowns all intricate silk brocades shot through with metallic threads and glinting like jewels. Glen MacPhersons digital lensing has been balanced in post in such a way to let the electric blues on the kings guards uniforms pop just a bit more intensely especially in the many bright sunlit rooms (a mix of Bavarian locations and sets at Berlins Studio Babelsberg) deployed for the palace scenes. The use of 3D rather limits the fluidity of the action sequences which ought to be Andersons strong suit but it does nothing but favors for Paul Denham Austerberrys rococo production design.
