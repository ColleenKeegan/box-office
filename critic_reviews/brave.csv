As the star of the new epic-scaled Braveheart Gibson celebrates yet another man of selfless valor. And as its director he displays some daring of his own.Braveheart - a spirited and bloody evocation of the life and brutal times of William Wallace the greatest of Scotlands heroes - plunges us into the Middle Ages. It also takes us back about three decades in movie history to a go-for-broke era in which studios hired entire armies and had Charlton Heston or Kirk Douglas lead them into battle. (The current cost of producing Hestons El Cid as computed a few years back 125 million).Gibson - who plays a Wallace whose struggles are by turns moving and rousing - also directed Braveheart. He is either bravehearted or pigheaded take your pick in refusing to accede to prevailing views in matters of pace His movie is almost three hours long and its leisurely tempo and thoughtfulness make no concession to audiences used to MTV speed.Nor does Gibson defer to the growing chorus of complaints against Hollywood for the violence it sanctions. In Bravehearts brilliantly staged battle scenes heads roll and limbs fly. Gibson wants us to face what it was like when sword and ax met flesh and bone. And gruesome though the approach may be the gory realism transports us into the world of William Wallace.But Braveheart is no thrice-familiar lament on the futility of war. It is the brutal stating of an urgently contemporary theme - that power corrupts - aired in 13th-century Scotland. Wallace a commoner is slow to take up arms against the English but is driven to rebellion by treachery and then butchery that reaches into his family.Gibsons Wallace is given to speeches about freedom and the rights of man that have no place in the medieval mind-set. And its doubtful that Wallace ever resorted to the inspired military maneuver of having his front line hoist its kilts and moon the oncoming English horde. But the startling attack of Big Macs is a droll touch that livens up the blood-drenched solemnity of the story.Bravehearts screenplay pits Wallace against King Edward I (Patrick McGoohan) who went by a nickname more suited to an NBA guard Edward the Longshanks. While Edward frets about his weakling son he cleverly sabotages Wallaces attempts to unify Scotlands warring clans. Together the Scots could drive the English out of their country for good but theyre more interested in fighting each other over ancient tribal feuds.As a director Gibson shows a command of individual moments and scenes even if the big picture occasionally gets lost in the Highland mists. As an actor he gives us a cultivated man who mastered several languages and tried to learn the political skills to match his martial prowess.Wallaces weapon of choice was a fearsome five-foot broadsword. (Its still on display at Stirling Castle and requires a strong man even to lift.) Gibson has bulked up to wield the sword and in a summer jammed with more obvious crowd-pleasers he and Braveheart have an uphill battle. But with a film of such imposing production values and resolute commitment from a fine cast he deserves to win.BRAVEHEART   Produced by Mel Gibson Alan Ladd Jr. and Bruce Davey; directed by Gibson; written by Randall Wallace; photography by John Toll; music by James Horner; distributed by Paramount Pictures.Running time 2 hours 50 mins.William Wallace - Mel GibsonPrincess Isabelle - Sophie MarceauKing Edward I - Patrick McGoohanMurron - Catherine McCormackHamish - Brendan GleesonParents guide R (graphic violence)Showing at area theaters Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""http//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> comments powered by Disqus Commenting policy | Comments FAQ FEATURED ARTICLESApothecary gardens fuel farm-to-medicine-cabinet movementTiffany Trump and Naomi Biden graduate Penn dad and granddad looking onPowerball fever Jackpot rises to 900 millionMoreDe Mazia Art Brings 2.38 MillionLeader Of Jbm Sentenced To Life Aaron Jones Was Convicted Of Conspiring To Distribute 100 Million In Cocaine.

With Mel Gibson Sophie Marceau Patrick McGoohan Catherine McCormack. Directed and co-produced by Gibson. At area theaters. Running time 179 mins. Rated R. 3 STARS OUTFITTED WITH HAIR extensions blue face and a kilt Mel Gibson rides lustily into battle in ""Braveheart"" a stirring adventure that he directed himself. The Middle Ages here refers to 13th-century Scotland not Gibsons age as he makes the midlife career change he began when he directed himself in the restrained ""Man Without a Face."" Now hes swashing and buckling with a not-bad Scots accent as William Wallace a historical figure who apparently fought with a brave heart (and who preceded Rob Roy Macgregor by several centuries) but about whom little else is known. Screenwriter Randall Wallace has taken poetic license to turn the character into the bravest manliest sexiest bluest-eyed Scot ever to spill blood on a battlefield as he helps his downtrodden countrymen fight off the rule of the untrustworthy King Edward I of England (Patrick McGoohan). As a boy William sees his father and friends killed by the kings men. A limpid-eyed local girl presses a flower into his hand. As a man he returns to his old village to bedazzle them with his book-smarts (he speaks several languages and knows when to hold em when to fold em) and to court that little girl now grown up into newcomer Catherine McCormack. You know theyre meant for each other because shes the only lassie with more hair than Mel. Evidently everyone in Scotland at the time was a Fabio in the making or in the grooming. Whatever other horrors the English nobles were imposing on the Scots the last straw comes when the English invoke the right to have their way with local brides on wedding nights. This means war Because its the Middle Ages this means war with sticks stones arrows war paint and a lot of yelling. Gibson stages at least two giant battlefield clashes and although hes no Kenneth Branagh (""Henry V"") the main reason ""Braveheart"" succeeds is that Gibsons character does everything for love. THE MOVIE IS AT HEART A ROmance. When the English princess (of French birth) hears about William Wallaces devotion to the woman he loves her heart melts and shes ready to give away the keys to the kingdom. Despite all the manly rock-heaving and wound-dressing the movie will probably end up appealing mostly to women who want to see Mels bluer-than-blue eyes as he gazes adoringly at his beloved. ""Braveheart"" runs punishingly long but it eases the pain by constantly winking at the audience. Mels men raise their kilts to moon their attackers and there is a host of colorful sidekicks to provide comic relief. One such bit that doesnt quite work involves some homophobic jokes about the English kings gay son who is portrayed as whiny and mincing. Although Gibson takes a bit of a chance surrounding himself with Christ imagery do movie stars die for our sins? he has nevertheless created a lavish entertaining spectacle full of manly men dastardly villains rousing battles and women who easily see Mels hero potential through all that messy hair.

FRIDAYS GUIDE TO MOVIES amp; MUSIC. Siskels Flicks Picks.`Crumb Digs Deep As The Oscars Come Up EmptyMay 26 1995|By Gene Siskel.Our Flick of the Week is ""Crumb"" and although much bigger and quite entertaining pictures like ""Braveheart"" and ""Casper"" are opening this week Id be remiss if I didnt use this space to signal the opening of a truly special film Terry Zwigoffs brave documentary about underground cartoonist Robert Crumb.Back in January when I first reviewed it I said that I didnt expect to see a better film this year. I havent. And yes I did call the movie ""brave"" an odd word to use to describe a film. And whats brave about the documentary is that it never backs off from digging deeper into the emotional life of its fascinating subject."");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""300"" height=""160""gt;In what might make a satisfactory ending for most documentaries Zwigoff manages to get Crumb the San Francisco-based creator of such 60s icons as Mr. Natural to admit that much of his material grew out of teenage insecurities involving rejection by girls. We see the drawings read the captions and understand what caused a youngster to take up pen and ink to achieve revenge against those who considered him a nerd.But ""Crumb"" goes beyond that way beyond that. We meet Roberts brothers and what a strange pair they are. Older brother Charles who was a cartoonist before Robert turns out to have never left his mothers home in the last 30 years. Younger brother Maxon likes to sit on a bed of nails and--how to say this?--swallows a long piece of string to cleanse himself internally. There are two Crumb sisters who refused to participate in the documentary.And right about now you may be thinking that ""Crumb"" is too weird for your taste. Maybe so. But the subjects it delves into are universal including parenting and the nature of the artistic impulse.Im always floored when I see a movie that manages to capture the essence of a human life in just two hours. ""Crumb"" does that extraordinarly well and just like ""Hoop Dreams"" it too was passed over for Oscar consideration by the Academy Award documentary committee.""Crumb"" is playing exclusively at the Music Box Theater 3733 N. Southport Ave. Chicagos finest commercial venue for adventurous programming. Its a wonderful theater in a solid neighborhood; if you havent been there ""Crumb"" will provide a perfect introduction.

No one acts with more conviction and his errors are honest ones.In his latest movie Gibson isnt just the star hes also the director. And he directs the same way he acts - with all his big brave heart.Based on a legend of medieval Scotland Braveheart is a big brave heartfelt motion picture an epic that doesnt lose itself in its epic scale.How long has it been since this kind of picture has packed this much passion and punch? Surely the recent cautious-to-a-fault Rob Roy wasnt even fighting in the same league.Gibson plays William Wallace a Scottish Robin Hood who leads his countrymen in a savage struggle against English tyranny.William we learn early on isnt just intelligent hes also book-educated and well-traveled (which suggests he possesses perspective). Hes even somewhat artistic To a young woman he loves he offers little handmade gifts.And although William has suffered mightily as a Scot he hasnt allowed bitterness to consume him. His suffering has left him with an unshakable determination to lead his people to freedom.Much of the movie is devoted to the battles between Williams forces and those of the merciless English monarch King Edward I.These battles are violent indeed and Gibson doesnt spare us the bloody details. But if the powerfully gritty Braveheart lacks finesse it is far from crude.At two hours and 48 minutes this picture is a long sit but it doesnt feel that way. Gibson and screenwriter Randall Wallace may paint with broad strokes but they are completely lucid about their reasons for every one of them.During those stirring battle scenes you feel each slash and swipe of the blades because the filmmakers get you to care so much about how things will come out. And although there are massive armies involved you can follow the battlefield strategies of the warring parties as if you were watching a game of chess.Mel Gibson has thrown so much of himself into directing this film that its really somewhat astonishing to discover that he has had enough energy left over to manage a heroic performance.Even when he isnt starring in an action picture Gibson is a physical performer whose character is defined as much by the way he looks and moves as by what he says. You really had to watch him in Hamlet (1990) for the picture to make sense.In Braveheart Gibsons huge arms and shoulders tell you that his character is an impressive fighter his clear blue eyes say that he knows just where to strike at an enemy and his unassuming stance indicates that hed prefer to avoid conflict - if only that were possible.As the sinister King Edward Patrick McGoohan (TVs The Prisoner) is superb although his is the sort of brilliantly verbal performance that you listen to more than you watch. Yet his words are spoken so insinuatingly that you feel you can see them twisting like snakes the instant they leave his mouth.Brendan Gleeson (The Snapper) plays Hamish the not-always-gentle giant in Williams band with an amusing intensity. And David OHara portrays Stephen the bands wild Irish member with a fine madness. (Stephen speaks directly with God or so he claims.)Although there arent many women in view those that there are are every bit as strong as the strongest of the men. Quick-eyed Catherine McCormack plays Murron Williams wife with a beautiful boldness while the soulful Sophie Marceau plays the French-born Princess Isabelle like a woman who knows she will one day lead a nation.Before directing Braveheart Gibson (who also co-produced it) had directed only one other film The Man Without a Face (1993). Though heartfelt it was overwrought but he has learned a lot since then.Sure I have my quibbles. For one thing I could have done with fewer calendar-art views of the Scottish countryside. And the musical score pushes too hard at times.But as always Gibsons missteps are taken honestly. He isnt pandering hes showing us his heart.And taking all the risks that go with that.

Jones The Bleader Film June 08 1995 Movies | Movie Review Tweet Pin It Reprints Share Blood All Over By Anthony Puccinelli Braveheart  Directed by Mel Gibson Written by Randall Wallace With Gibson Sophie Marceau Patrick McGoohan and Catherine McCormack. Mel Gibson is not known for the chances he takes. After a promising beginning--he appeared in critically acclaimed artistic films like Gallipoli The Year of Living Dangerously and Mrs. Soffel--he became a Hollywood star with Lethal Weapon in 1987. The box-office success of that film prompted Gibson to make two sequels plus the calculated and uncourageous Tequila Sunrise Bird on a Wire Air America and Maverick. Box-office grosses affirm an actors work. When your movie makes more than 100 million the public are in effect saying ""We love it. Keep it up."" Its like Skinnerian behavior modification with money and adulation replacing food pellets. Which is why so many of our biggest stars share or pretend to share the audiences assumptions and tastes. For Gibson such assumptions are automatic hes not better than his audience he is his audience. But Braveheart which Gibson directed and stars in does not at first glance seem an automatic blockbuster. Set in the Scottish Highlands in the late 13th century it tells the story of Sir William Wallace (Gibson) a great military hero who led the fight for Scottish freedom against Englands King Edward I (""Edward Longshanks""). In an effort to break the Scots spirit Edward imposed a law that a Scottish bride must spend the first night of her marriage in the bed of the ruling English noble. When Wallaces wife violently resists shes tied to a stake and threatened with execution. Scanning the vast empty horizon shes in the metaphoric position of all Scots--looking for freedom for protection by a force more powerful than herself. Programmed by countless other Hollywood movies we expect a last-minute rescue and her sudden murder is shocking. Braveheart has a gut-wrenching bone-breaking sword-thwacking verve. Like Wallace Gibson seems charged with blood lust. This is manly maximum-impact movie-making full of brawn brawls decapitations castrations and men bleeding the ground red. The variety of weapons is astonishing from buckets of bubbling pitch for burning skin to balls on chains for crushing craniums; from deer antlers for gouging eyes to gigantic spears for impaling cavalry horses. Wallace roils and inspires his troops with hoarse speeches about ""freedom"" and ""last chances."" Full of adrenaline they charge down the field toward their enemies like a football team after the kickoff. Their momentum and rage transform terror into what looks very like courage and Gibson skillfully captures the impact as the armies crash into each other and fight and die. Gibsons direction illuminates the ugly reality of war casting a heroic light on brutality. Bravehearts many cinematic bloodbaths are the result of Wallaces wish to avenge his wifes death--the movies like a Scottish Death Wish. The British in their ocher cloaks glow against the mud like psychedelic lizards--trespassers obviously alien to the land neon targets to be killed so that natural hues can be restored. Swarming around Wallace like red ants theyre slaughtered in slow motion and Wallaces vengeance mobilizes the Scots revenge leads to revolution. Is Braveheart historically accurate? The narrator charges that ""history is written by hangmen"" so probably not; but Gibsons focus is on heroism not history. According to the film William Wallace is leading the Scots not to death but to freedom. When King Edward captures him and brings him to England to make an example of him even during torture Wallace refuses to break; Gibson implies that Wallaces refusal to compromise inspires the rebels to victory. Glorifying suffering Gibson defines a hero by his ability to withstand pain. The film ends with an epiphany of masochistic suffering and self-sacrifice. Wallace is hung by the neck stretched on the rack like a rubber band and disemboweled but he refuses to beg for mercy or betray his ideals. It certainly looks heroic to the audience munching popcorn in a comfortable movie theater divorced from his pain. This is martyrdom as victory. At times like these one cant help but question Gibsons vision. Yet aside from a love scene in which the rain and the night inexplicably disappear in one cut there are no noticeable flaws in his direction. In fact he proves to be quite talented--except for his pacing. The movie keeps surging into climaxes and epiphanies but there are so many of them and they occur with such clockwork regularity that the effect at first overwhelming eventually becomes numbing. Its like overindulging in sweets--after a while chocolate starts to make you sick. And once we adjust to the feverish emotional pitch its impact is muted. Classical plots build to a climax and subside into denouement. Braveheart builds to a climax then catches its breath for another climax. There are too many betrayals too many decapitations. We overload on grime and blood and rage. Its as if Gibson were trying to sustain an adrenaline rush for all 173 minutes of the film. Gibsons film company is called Icon and he knows how to maintain his own iconic status. Wallace seems to be the only Scotsman who wears short sleeves probably because Gibson associates heroism with muscle. In an iconographic masterstroke Gibson frames Wallace--a muddy earthy figure (at times it seems the entire 70 million budget went toward strategically placed dirt) with a flashing sword--alone against the sky. The only things in the shot bluer than the sky are Gibsons eyes. At one point Wallace meets the Princess Isabelle (Isabelle Adjani look-alike Sophie Marceau) and tells her of her father-in-laws crimes against the Scottish people. When she appears dubious he advises her to ""Look into [King Edwards] eyes. See if they can convince you he tells the truth."" Plainly Mels baby blues convince her that he does. And they convince his fans who like him well enough at least to spend seven dollars to see him. And thats exactly what you need to be a Hollywood star seven-dollar appeal. In interviews and films Gibson seems a genuinely simple man. This is no insult but it goes far toward explaining his box-office clout. The tyranny of mass taste guarantees stars who embody the values of their audience. The actors and directors who dont offend who stand for the middle-class values and populist ideals of the majority have the broadest base of fans. Do middlebrow stars like Harrison Ford Kevin Costner and Tom Cruise seem like complex people? Do we struggle to understand their psyches? No because they represent what many of us would like to see ourselves to be courageous resourceful moral and able to kick major butt. The films final image is of men charging into battle undergoing the age-old baptism into manhood via violence. When Wallace responds to an insult with ""I do not lie but I am a savage"" Gibsons conviction makes it clear that both he and Wallace aspire to savagery. Wallace has been turned into a savage by English laws and repressions. By proudly proclaiming his savagery he separates himself from the ""civilized"" landed educated classes who behave in such ordered ruthless ways. William Wallace became a savage to remain free. Mel Gibson became a savage to make Braveheart the brutality of the film is an affront to civilized standards of filmmaking. His movie shuns the aesthetic order moons critical norms and bludgeons subtlety. Near the end of the film the father of a Scottish noble tells his son ""Its easy to admire the uncompromising man. But its exactly the ability to compromise that makes a man noble. Compromise is the only way to preserve your lineage and make you the king of Scotland."" That sounds reasonable on paper but on-screen the speakers face is shown rotting away under blood-stained bandages an image that undercuts the argument considerably. ""All men betray"" the father continues. ""All lose heart."" His son replies ""I dont want to lose heart. I want to believe as William Wallace does."" He could be speaking for Gibson too. Watching Braveheart the audience picks up on his belief in what hes doing. Even when Braveheart is conventionally stirring it has heart. Gibson is not a shill an action star concerned only with the box-office gross. The producers begged him to cut 20 minutes and one can imagine the pressure brought to bear by the investors of millions of dollars. But Gibson perhaps inspired by Wallace remained true to his vision. Its just a coincidence that his vision is so commercial. Braveheart is both thoroughly conventional and thoroughly uncompromising. Gibson bellows his cliches with conviction. Thats why hes a star. Unfortunately mass taste is sometimes infected with latent prejudices. Gibson no fan of political correctness includes harmless jokes in the movie about the French (""They will grovel to anyone with strength"") and the Irish (""In order to find an equal an Irishman is forced to talk to God""). But the portrayal of Prince Edward later Edward II is more problematic. The heir to the throne wears rouge is an incompetent neglectful leader and dresses in frilly finery while making googly eyes at his smiling male companion. Not only does he fail to satisfy his woman--crime enough--hes also weak and groveling before his father. In Tony Scotts Beverly Hills Cop II just before statuesque Aryan ice queen Brigitte Nielsen is pumped full of lead a cop says disgustedly ""Women"" As shes bloodied in a hail of gunfire the audience is meant to laugh chuckles mingling with the bullets. Somehow her sex has become part of the justification for killing her. In Braveheart Prince Edwards gay lover is tossed out a window and the audience laughs at his death too. Scott would have had to think before putting a racial slur in Beverly Hills Cop II. He didnt think about a sexist slur because he was oblivious to its sexism much as Gibson is oblivious to the homophobia in Braveheart. Of course Gibson does wear a kilt for the entirety of the film. Is there something about wearing a skirt that causes a man to question his manhood? That would explain the constant macho roughhousing in Braveheart greetings come in the form of punches not hellos or handshakes. Somebody is always getting up off the ground holding his sore jaw and saying ""Good to see you."" The battle scenes feature mooning and castration and theres much talk of penis size and kissing ass ""He could blow bolts of lightning from his arse"" ""Put your head between your legs and kiss your arse"" ""Prepare to have your arse kissed by a king"" and ""The commoners will kiss his arse and so we must."" Its ironic but revealing that the only word spoken as often as ""arse"" in Braveheart is ""freedom.""

Directed by Mel Gibson from a script by Randall Wallace. Alderwood Crossroads Everett Mall Gateway Issaquah 9 Kirkland Parkplace Mountlake 9 Oak Tree Parkway Plaza Puyallup Uptown. ""R"" - Restricted because of violence language nudity. Many movies deal with battlefield heroics. Few seriously attempt to define heroism. In recent years Jeff Daniels remarkable performance in ""Gettysburg"" came closest to demonstrating what it takes for one fragile frightened leader to defeat his own doubts and inspire his men to risk all in combat. Daniels was playing an educated man the Civil War colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain and he suggested an intellectuals take on the idea of courage. In his new 50 million battle epic ""Braveheart"" Mel Gibson goes for a more primitive approach. Playing the 13th-century Scottish rebel leader William Wallace Gibson also deals with the transformation of an unlikely soldier into a formidable warrior. This time theres something quite savage about the process yet its equally stirring. Partly this is because Wallaces cause is just. Faced with a vicious British king (Patrick McGoohan) who intends to rid Scotland of Scottish blood by encouraging British soldiers to impregnate newlywed Scottish brides Wallace is forced to act when his own wife (Catherine McCormack) is attacked. Almost a passive character at first he becomes enraged inspiring his countrymen in an all-out assault on their longtime tormentors. Wallace is lucky that the kings gay son (Peter Hanly) is neither a gifted militarist nor much of a husband to his French wife (Sophie Marceau) who turns out to be less than sympathetic to the British cause. When the kings away on the continent the son makes a royal mess of the situation bringing in a male lover and adviser who is promptly murdered by the king when he returns. (This segment of ""Braveheart"" has drawn protests from the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation which is demonstrating today in nine cities including Seattle. When questioned about it last week Gibson said he presented all the British characters in a negative way because the film was being told from the point of view of oppressed Scots. The alliance claims this sequence amounts to gay-bashing although the king who does the bashing is easily the most despicable character in the movie.) Many of the elements in Randall Wallaces script have a familiar ring. Like Charlton Hestons selfless warrior in ""El Cid"" Wallace is a noble subject who needs a nobler king than the would-be Scottish monarch played here by Angus McFadyen. Like Kirk Douglas slave leader in ""Spartacus"" Wallace unites and inspires disorganized troops brings out their best qualities constantly surprises his decadent enemy by catching them off-guard and is crucified for his efforts. But if screenwriter Wallace often seems to be borrowing from the religion-oriented super-spectacles of the early 1960s he and Gibson have done a thorough job of making those ideas and characters play in the 1990s. Theres a matter-of-fact grittiness about ""Braveheart"" that infects even its occasional touches of mysticism and photogenic romance. The movie is so well-cast with several unknowns making strong impressions in key supporting roles that the actors never have a chance to hint at deja vu. And the most familiar face Gibsons hasnt seemed this vital in years. The striking cinematography by this years Oscar-winning cameraman John Toll (""Legends of the Fall"") is complemented by a score by James Horner thats never too slick never too folksy. ""Braveheart"" runs for three full hours without intermission yet Gibson is rarely wasteful as a director. The graphic battles may grow repetitious toward the end the final scenes are almost sadistically drawn out and the script often lacks humor. But this movie moves.

"Great Scot - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Movie review.Great ScotMel Gibsons Intensity Helps Turn `Braveheartinto A Tale Of Epic ProportionsMay 24 1995|By Michael Wilmington Tribune Movie Critic.`Braveheart""--Mel Gibsons second movie as producer-director-star--is the kind of large lavish roaring historical adventure epic for which movies seem almost ideally suited.Its a show of tremendous sweep strength and visual beauty. But what makes it most interesting ultimately is the uniqueness of its subject the intensity of its treatment. Based on the spottily recorded career of one of Scotlands greatest military heroes Sir William Wallace--and set during a tumultuous period (around 1280-1305) when the Scots struggled for their freedom against Englands legendary King Edward I (or ""Edward Longshanks"")--its a gusty period piece done in such bold and entertaining strokes that youre rarely restive despite a near three-hour running time.Everything in ""Braveheart"" is elemental. The heroes are brave and hearty. The villains are foul and corrupt. The heroines are bold beauties. And the landscapes In any comparison with the recent Liam Neeson ""Rob Roy"" another Scottish historical adventure movie this picture wins hands down and kilts up. (It also wipes out all three ""Highlanders."")Shot by the brilliant outdoor cinematographer John Toll (""Wind"" ""Legends of the Fall"") through what seems almost continuous veils of rain and mist those spectacular Scottish Highlands--including the British Isles highest peak Glen Nevis--tower above the brawling humanity below with a ragged magnificence.In the midst of it all is Gibson himself an action movie star of iconically powerful good looks and temperament who here has fashioned himself a dream role and vehicle.The real-life Wallace a primitive intensely honorable knight remains a Scottish legend after 700 years because he battled for freedom against superior foes and hopeless odds--fighting both Englands brilliant Longshanks and his own turncoat opportunist Scots nobles. And in a way that maniacal dedication links Sir William up with some of Gibsons best-known roles apocalyptic outsider Mad Max of the Australian ""Road Warrior"" trilogy and suicidally energetic Detective Riggs of the ""Lethal Weapon"" movies warriors who were either stoic in a mad world or crazy in a modern one.So Gibson and screenwriter Randall Wallace (no relation) turn Sir William into a consummate movie Western hero transplanted across the sea. Raised in the rough provinces battling snobs and tyrants in castles there is more than a little in the part of both Rob Roy and Billy the Kid.Gibson Wallace a good fitThe role suits Gibson. One of the reasons he wasnt an ideal choice for ""Hamlet""--a role he played surprisingly well in Franco Zeffirellis 1990 film--is that its hard to imagine him having any trouble making up his mind. (Gibsons Hamlet seemed genuinely batty instead of a role-player.) Though he has played dysfunctional or tormented characters--the retarded lover in 1979s ""Tim"" the disfigured pariah in his fine 1993 directorial debut ""The Man Without a Face""--Gibsons screen persona suggests compulsive forward motion.That glittering-eyed recklessness works well for William Wallace a truly defiant and heaven-storming hero. When Wallaces outmanned ragtag rowdies face the overwhelming British Army at the famous battle of Stirling Castle--and whip up their kilts to moon the enemy before the fight--its a quintessential Gibson moment. (That moment is unrecorded of course either by history or by William Wallaces sole contemporary biographer Blind Harry the Poet.)In modern action thrillers outrageousness seems the last gasp of all those big budgets and spent imaginations. Here the excessiveness is always fun--all the more because of the burning romanticism at this storys core.In the movie Wallace is driven to revolt by tragic love. His rebellion starts after the murder of his betrothed Murron (Catherine McCormack) when she refuses the local custom of granting British lords prenuptial sexual rights with all Scottish wives. And because Wallace never wavers from his political purpose or personal vendetta Gibsons near-psychopathic screen intensity finds a grand outlet.Mixing tragedy and adventureAnd worthy hatable foes as well. The films Edward Longshanks (Patrick McGoohan) is an icy tyrant his son Prince Edward (Peter Hanly) a prancing fool. And the leading Scots noble Robert the Bruce (Angus McFadyen) is a good-bad waverer--a Hamlet type. For his guiding spirit Bruce has a truly monstrous villain a nameless manipulative leper whose face is practically falling off (played by that great eccentric Scots character actor Ian Bannen).The acting in ""Braveheart"" is as full-blown as the writing is hot-blooded. McCormack Bannen McGoohan and many of the others--especially French actress Sophie Marceau as Princess Isabelle and Irish actor Brendan Gleeson as Hamish the Highland giant--all have their moments in the pictures sun (or gloom).1 | 2 | Next MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesStory In `My Giant Deals With Big IssuesApril 23 1998The New BroodAugust 6 1989Here are selected capsule reviews of movies in current...January 30 2004Find More Stories AboutMad MaxGreat ScotTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter",http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-05-24/features/9505240126_1_great-scot-mad-max-sir-william-wallace,200,brave6,brave,chicagotribune

Hardly lacking for ambition Mel Gibsons second directing effort represents an enormous marketing challenge due not only to its three-hour-length but the 13th-century subject matter and lack of marquee appeal beyond the star himself. A huge bloody and sprawling epic ""Braveheart"" is the sort of massive vanity piece that would be easy to disparage if it didnt essentially deliver. Hardly lacking for ambition Mel Gibsons second directing effort represents an enormous marketing challenge due not only to its three-hour-length but the 13th-century subject matter and lack of marquee appeal beyond the star himself. Those factors should conspire to keep the pic from hacking its way through this summers pack of aspiring blockbusters its merits notwithstanding. There are clearly elements of ""Spartacus"" running through the film in tone and inspiration from the enormous battles with thousands of kilted extras to Gibsons William Wallace -- a charismatic leader obsessed with freedom who rallies Scottish rebels against the tyrannical English king Edward the Longshanks (Patrick McGoohan). Pic also engages in considerable court intrigue from the forced marriage between Edwards gay son and a French princess (Sophie Marceau in her English-language debut) to the inner torment of Robert the Bruce (Angus McFadyen) one of the many Scottish lords whose feuding and avarice ultimately leave Wallaces band to their own considerable devices. A less notable but unavoidable comparison would be pics length which does feel excessive; the film engages in one massive battle too many. Theres also a strong romantic undercurrent but even with that the movie is not for the squeamish demonstrating as it does in graphic detail the brutality of hand-to-hand combat -- masterfully staged sequences that nevertheless become somewhat numbing after repeated exposure to all the bludgeoning and skewering. The story begins at a far more leisurely pace than what follows introducing the audience to Wallace as a boy squired off by a kindly uncle after his father and brother are killed fighting the English king. Wallace returns a man (with flowing locks and a killer physique reminiscent of Gibsons look in the third ""Mad Max"" movie) and immediately begins wooing the radiant Murron (Catherine McCormack) secretly wedding her to avoid a barbaric law granting nobles the right to bed Scottish lasses on their wedding night. The relationship ends in tragedy and Wallaces released anguish -- much like the slave revolt that sets the action rolling in ""Spartacus"" -- uncorks pent-up hostility as a growing band of rebels takes up arms against the kings forces. At that point ""Braveheart"" turns into a muscular and brutal medieval war movie with Wallace consistently outsmarting Longshanks henchmen and becoming an increasingly potent nuisance. Gibsons direction meanders at first but takes hold once the fighting starts and while the movie is indeed a long sit from that point on its far from boring. The battles barring some unwelcome slow-motion shots are spectacular with almost balletic stunt and second-unit work all around. The director also pulls the camera back to capture the grandeur and scope of the conflict which again is diminished only through repetition. While it would have been a shame to lose some of the footage the movie would have been better served by discussing some of Wallaces victories rather than depicting them. The script by first-time screenwriter Randall Wallace (who bears no direct known relation to the Wallace clan) offers scant comic relief but Gibson does a laudable job with the largely unknown supporting cast among them Brendan Gleeson and David OHara as two of his chief lieutenants. Marceau and McCormack both cut striking figures in limited femme roles amidst the carnage while McGoohan perhaps overplays his hand slightly as the villainous king a figure notable principally for his utter amorality. Gibsons central performance is also strong and his Wallace does inspire in both his messianic zeal and his unflinching heroism. It is notable in light of past controversial remarks attributed to the star that the kings gay son (well played by Peter Hanly) is an unsympathetic character but then again so is virtually everyone of noble rank in the film. Tech credits are roundly impressive with sweeping vistas of the Scottish countryside and lavish costuming production design and James Horner score. With the admirable ""Rob Roy"" lingering in theaters if nothing else this new wave of medieval fare could make macho men in kilts fashionable as ""Braveheart"" (a catchy title never uttered in the movie) serves them up by the thousands.

From the opening shots swirling through the mists o time over snowy peaks and silvery lochs to the final torture scenes in which disembowelment provokes only a brave grimace Gibsons epic offers a stew of Hollywood cliches. Political analysis is not on the menu; this is a tale of heroes n villains pure and simplistic. The Sassenachs are rude stereotypes while the Scots are either macho hunks or should they be aristos dour quislings. The battle scenes are staged effectively but for the most part this is a vehicle for Gibson graduating from cocky Lethal Weapon register to something more one-dimensional and rhetorically solemn.

It was found to be the second worst example of inaccuracy ever found in film history and blatantly anti-English I love Scotland but wish its people would honestly appraise the countrys developement since the formation of the UK..compared to its insignificance prior The inventiveness of the Scot has only been apparent since a UK government based in England built centres of excellence in Scotland..funded by tax-payers from everywhere Oil as well was discovered and recovered by some 12 countries..and only about 14% of this funding came from Scotland The UK has been far more of a world power since the union..and it is time to assess the facts Namely the Scottish clan wars claimed far more lives than were inflicted by the English. The Scotts were raiding England long before any territorial claims were made the other way. The English never sanctioned Prima Nocte..a direct lie..and Wallace never met the Princess...who was 10 at his death There is simply no truth to the film at all..and anyone who can watch it with a straight face..must quetion their own integrity This is artistic licence taken too far..and is an insult to all those depicted..including Wallace Dont let jingoistic blind patriotism rob you of your ability to check things out The film is garbageFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 24 2009MikeFeaturedHey Jackson Brown The movie certainly has flaws...IIT IS A MOVIE.....you must realize that they are for the purpose of entertainment.

It is a film written directed and acted for the average Jo and the Middle Class family. It offers no exploration of important or analytical themes. Nor does it provide an in-depth psychoanalytical examination of the human heart and It is certainly is an historical documentary no its a rousing and inspiring epic. It is the typical Hero versus villain ""Hollywoodised"" movie set in the 13th or 14th century with Scottish patriotism as a front. Its moving and inspiring the average viewer would trade a rainy day to sit down and watch the few hours of entertainment Braveheart has to offer.

"MOVIE REVIEW  Mel Battles for an Epic War Film  Gibsons Braveheart costumes its Scottish hero for adventure but whooping and pillaging dont ignite the fires of freedom. - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMOVIE REVIEW  Mel Battles for an Epic War Film  Gibsons Braveheart costumes its Scottish hero for adventure but whooping and pillaging dont ignite the fires of freedom.May 24 1995|PETER RAINER | TIMES STAFF WRITER In ""Braveheart"" Mel Gibson plays 13th-Century Scottish freedom fighter William Wallace and boy is his heart ever brave. So are his eyes his mane his pecs his knuckles. But hes not just brave--hes smart too. As the young Williams father tells the boy just before the British slaughter him ""Its our wits that make us men.""At close to three hours ""Braveheart"" is a great big chunk of brogues and pillaging and whooping. Gibson who also directed is priming us for an epic experience--""Spartacus"" in kilts. As a filmmaker he lacks the epic gift but the movie scripted by Randall (no relation) Wallace works on a fairly basic level as a hiss-the-English medieval Western. Gibsons calisthenic efforts are clunky but theyre not boring at least not until the film moves into battle overkill in the third hour and the soundtrack turns into one big aaarrgh .Wallace who leads a rebellion against the tyrannical English King Edward the Longshanks (Patrick McGoohan) after his wife (Catherine McCormack) is tragically sundered is a celebrated Scottish hero about whom very little that isnt legendary is known.Gibson plunges straight into the folklore. Just before the battle of Stirling where his men are hopelessly outnumbered against the British Wallace rouses his troops with a speech that plays like a Classics Illustrated version of the St. Crispins Day speech from Shakespeares ""Henry V.""Once he gets the fighting spirit early on Wallace never lightens up not even when hes knocking around with his shaggy Wild Bunch of fellow liberators--the burly porcine Hamish (Brendan Gleeson) the Irish hothead Stephen (David OHara) and the old warrior Campbell (James Cosmo) who yanks arrows out of his chest with his bare hands and then laughs lustily. These guys arent just medieval Theyre practically Cro-Magnon.Even though Wallace practically keens with a love for freedom the real reason the Scots whoop and war in this film appears to be less than transcendent. With all the horrors inflicted by the English the film portrays the Scots as perpetually ready-to-rumble even among their own clans. Freedom is a guy thing. (In a recent New Yorker a Ziegler cartoon depicts a clan of warring Scots with the caption ""Has it ever occurred to anyone that if we stopped wearing these damned skirts we wouldnt have to march off to defend our manhood every five minutes?"")With such a bunch it would be a feat to hold up the English as much worse than anybody else. But Gibson has his ace in the hole Patrick McGoohan is in possession of perhaps the most villainous enunciation in the history of acting. (Who can forget the way he ripped into the word scanners in ""Scanners""?)In actual history King Edward came up with the idea of Parliament--no mean feat--but here hes a lizardly terror. And hes given a gay son Prince Edward (Peter Hanly) who is depicted as such a mincing recidivist caricature that when his father cautions him that he may one day become king you half expect him to add ""or . . . queen?""Gibson realizes he needs a love interest to soften up his Wide World of War so he periodically works in kissy pastoral interludes involving Wallaces wife and later Princess Isabelle (Sophie Marceau) the daughter of the French king who is married to the prince but who hankers for the fiery Scot. The ruffian impresses her at their first powwow by speaking to her in French then in Latin. When they clasp against sylvan settings her fiery long tresses are twinned with his. Gibsons longhaired look not only outdoes Liam Neeson in ""Rob Roy"" it even trumps Brad Pitt in ""Legends of the Fall."" (Did the title of that film refer to Pitts mane?)The battle scenes are more impressive than the love scenes. From a commercial standpoint Gibson may be wondering particularly with his female fans If they come to see me will they stay for the beheadings? The skirmishes are well-staged. The rain of British arrows upon the Scots has an obscene horror--shot high into the air they dart down deep into flesh. The Scots ingenious use of 14-foot sharpened poles at Stirling is a ringing endorsement of the wits-that-make-us-men stuff.But Gibson as a director doesnt go beyond the good guys/bad guys war plan. For the battle scenes to be great they would have to show us how the Scots especially when they pushed into York were also driven into frenzies of inhumanity. The film never tries to confuse our loyalties or question the strategies of our hero or bring home the all-embracing soul-destroying horrors of war for all sides. ""Braveheart"" may be rip-roaring but it isnt all that brave.  MPAA rating R for brutal medieval warfare. Times guidelines It includes lots of graphic warfare not for the squeamish.(BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC)BraveheartMel Gibson William WallaceSophie Marceau Princess IsabellePatrick McGoohan King Edward ICatherine McCormack MurronA Paramount Pictures release of an Icon Productions/Ladd Co. production.

Starring Mel Gibson Catherine McCormack Patrick McGoohan and Sophie Marceau. Directed by Mel Gibson. (R. 178 minutes. At the Galaxy Alexandria Empire and other Bay Area theaters). So point-blank violent that some viewers will struggle to keep brave stomachs Mel Gibsons long gritty and histrionic ""Braveheart"" faces an uphill battle to win anything but begrudging respect from even the most gullible of hero worshipers. Three hours long ""Braveheart"" stars Gibson with newcomer Catherine McCormack as his fiery black-eyed love and a wonderfully gnarly-looking Patrick McGoohan as his nemesis King Edward the Longshanks. It opens today at Bay Area theaters. Gibson directed himself as the kilt-clad hero in ""Braveheart"" as if he were giving the ultimate full- fist salute to freedom-loving souls and Christian believers. At times the film seems an obsessive ode to Mel Gibson machismo. WARRIOR AND FIREBRAND Theres also no denying that Gibson is a robust screen presence. But playing the part of legendary 13th century Scottish ""freedom fighter"" William Wallace Gibson wants to be righteous warrior silver-tongued democratic firebrand and Christ figure in one fell swoop. But the swoop doesnt fall fast enough and ""Braveheart"" -- complete with Gibson on a cross -- bumps along for at least one hour too many. Frequent slow-motion sequences offer little more than a chance to study the sumptuous but ultimately burdensome details not the least of which is Gibson himself who looks like a 70s rock and roll idol from some Celtic thrash band. Some of ""Bravehearts"" smaller parts are also the most memorable -- the too-brief appearance of British beauty McCormack as the heros clandestine wife; the pointedly amusing portrayal of King Edwards son as a swishy homosexual (Peter Hanly) unwilling to ful fill the sexual desires of his pouty wife French princess Isabelle (Sophie Marceau); the Scottish warriors baring their pinkish manhood to British legions in prebattle rituals. Then theres the blue war paint on Gibsons face that makes him look like a crazy time-warped San Jose Sharks fan. Theres no denying ""Braveheart"" is an eyeful. The battle scenes are staged with enough dramatic sweep to make De Mille envious. They have a gritty bite that helps keep ""Braveheart"" big and boldly handsome. IMPRESSIVE TREAT Sometimes hauntingly beautiful in its green mud-daubed and gray-sky tones (mostly Irish locations) and accompanied by a James Horner sound track that becomes a Celtic serenade between thunderous sword clanks the film is an impressive feast. But as many people who live in beautiful places know scenery alone doesnt pay the bills. ""Braveheart"" comes up short by beating the drums of human treachery and violence so loudly they become assaults. The film repeatedly sabotages its best intentions by almost smirkingly forcing upon viewers a repugnant violence that after a while has a mechanical feel to it. It depicts with graphic realism enough eviscerations decapitations disembowelments dismemberments defenestrations and skewerings that the overall effect is numbing. The overstated depiction of the ""freedom""-crying hero in sequences reminiscent of the crucifixion scenes in ""Spartacus"" are so farfetched they simply make Gibson look foolishly self-aggrandizing. If Gibsons intention is to remind viewers that the Middle Ages were a brutish time for warriors its a hollow gesture. His eagerness to capitalize on the 90s fixation with near-pornographic depictions of violence makes ""Braveheart"" inappropriate for young audiences -- or anybody sensitive to spurting oozing blood and spilled guts. Its the late 13th century and young farmer William Wallace (Gibson) is living under a ruthless pagan king of England Edward the Longshanks (McGoohan) a cunning cuss obsessed with holding sway over the tribal Scots and their lands. Longshanks tries a number of treacherous political tactics leaving scars on Wallaces impressionable young soul. When Wallace is old enough to seek a mate he marries his childhood sweetheart a beauty named Murron (McCormack) but the English have made a terrible demand on Scottish marriages -- all new brides are subject to a ""first night"" of forced sex by British lords. Wed in secret Wallaces bride is nonetheless snatched by the British and is killed when she fights off rape by a British soldier. Hatred becomes revenge and Wallace rallies defiant Scots from various clans to rise up against the treacherous king. The depiction of the Scottish warriors as hearty macho rough- and-tumble types is affectionate and fun. Several characterizations are finely shaded portrayals of earthy believable people -- Irish actor Brendan Gleeson as the robust Wallace crony Hamish; James Cosmo as the tough old coot Campbell; Peter Hanly as the gay Prince Edward; Angus McFadyen as soul- tormented Robert the Bruce.

"Braveheart | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; braveheart ) Braveheart (United States 1995) A movie review by James Berardinelli The crown jewel of 1995s summer blockbusters appears to have arrived early. Its hard to imagine any motion picture released between now and August matching Mel Gibsons Braveheart for spectacle. With its clashing armies heartstopping action and grand sense of romance this is the sort of film its a pleasure to see and review. Let me state my preferences up front. Im a big fan of the epic adventure a category in which Braveheart like cream rises to the top. Theres a lot in this film thats praiseworthy -- not the least of which is its ambition. Those viewing this picture may be easily reminded of Gettysburg The Last of the Mohicans Glory and such classics as Lawrence of Arabia El Cid and Spartacus. The grandeur is certainly present; nevertheless Gibson gives us not only memorable battles but characters of real substance. Borrowing from masters like Sam Peckinpah and David Lean the actor/director has crafted an exceptional cinematic tapestry in only his sophomore effort. Most of the time three hour movies have a few flat spots but Braveheart is constantly on the move -- riveting from start to finish. When the end credits began to roll I was hard pressed to accept that nearly 170 minutes had elapsed. The title character is William Wallace (Gibson) a hero of Scottish history whose legend has surely outstripped fact (in its own unique way the film acknowledges this). Wallace fought for Scotlands freedom in the late 13th century wielding his broadsword and influence to defeat the forces of King Edward I (Patrick McGoohan) the British monarch who had declared himself king of Scotland upon the former rulers demise. Braveheart builds slowly to its first gritty climax. Much of the early film concentrates on Wallaces love for Murron (Catherine McCormack). Their courtship is unhurried yet this is all preparation. The real meat of the story which includes political mechanations betrayal and dramatic battles is yet to come. Patrick Henry once said ""Give me liberty or give me death"" That might well be Wallaces motto. ""Its all for nothing if you dont have freedom"" The nobles of Scotland fight for land and riches but Wallace stands for the individual and earns respect with words and deeds. Bulked up and wearing a long-haired wig Gibson brings his usual wealth of charisma to the title role. Patrick McGoohan best known from TVs Secret Agent Man and The Prisoner is almost unrecognizable beneath a snowy beard. His Edward the Longshanks exudes an aura of cold menace. Hes a worthy foe for Wallace because his intelligence matches his ruthlessness. Sophie Marceau the French actress who plays Princess Isabelle and Catherine McCormack are both immensely appealing. Braveheart is a brutal bloody motion picture but the violence is not gratuitous. The maimings decapitations and other assorted gruesome details make Wallaces world seem real and immediate. In addition few theatrical moments make a more eloquent statement against war than when Gibson shows women and children weeping over the dead on a body-littered battlefield. War is a two-headed beast and both faces -- the glorious and the tragic -- are depicted. Lately certain films have come in pairs two Robin Hoods two Columbuses two Earps and now two Highlander epics. Rob Roy the first is a fine motion picture. Braveheart however is better offering an exhilarating and occasionally touching experience that has viewers leaving the theater caught up in an afterglow of wonder. These days heros like William Wallace are as rare as motion picture displays of this high uncompromising quality.

Perfunctory research in the Encyclopaedia Britannica and a few other sources has failed to uh uncover any such incident.But according to Mel Gibsons bloody glib saccharin and lengthy ""Braveheart"" the troops of Edward I were met with more than just a display of Scottish might. If the movie achieves little else it puts to rest that age-old question about what Scotsmen wear under their kilts.Gibsons second directorial effort in which the oppressed people of Scotland are led to freedom by a short man with dazzling blue eyes a dreadlock wig an Australian accent and excellent biceps is a rambling disappointment.The movie written by ex-television scriptwriter Randall Wallace (whose potential blood connection to his subject is undetermined) starts off at a disastrous limp. For a good 50 minutes we watch Wallace evolve from boy to man grow all that hair then woo and wed childhood sweetheart Murron (Catherine McCormack).Then after Murron runs somewhat afoul of the rapacious English law (in which English overlords get to sample the goods of brides on their wedding night) Wallace becomes an instant populist leader.Accompanied by strongman Hamish (Brendan Gleeson as Little John to Gibsons Robin Hood) and wild Irishman Stephen (David OHara in a psychotically endearing performance) Wallace rallies the clans for a major confrontation with the Sassenachs south of the border. He also attempts to mobilize the Scottish nobles (including Angus McFadyen as Robert the Bruce) but the allegiances of these figureheads are shaky.When Wallaces men (flush with their mooning success) take the war into the English town of York brutal King Edward I a k a Edward the Longshanks (Patrick ""Secret Agent"" McGoohan) decides its time to crush the threatening Scot. He also dispatches Isabelle (Sophie Marceau) his French daughter-in-law (unhappily married to Edwards theatrically effete namesake-son) to engage McMad Max with false concessions and Gallic comeliness.What little is known of the real Wallace comes from isolated facts and a lengthy fanciful ballad attributed to (I am not making this up) a sightless poet known as Blind Harry. So Gibson has much available license. However hes excessive on every front whether its the syrupy backlighted romance between Wallace and Murron or the heather-thronged killing fields. Authentic brutality is one thing but making the point over and over again is the mark of an overeager neophyte.If ""Braveheart"" were any longer it would have to be moved around by flatbed truck. By the time the story trudges to its hyper-climactic close (with Gibsons appetite for historical gory detail in major overdrive) you feel as though you marched through a couple of meaningless campaigns.Anyone with good hair and a few rock videos (or a lucrative acting career) can get a directors job from the studios these days. But few can guide a big project to more than competent completion. Gibson who previously directed ""The Man Without a Face"" has shown the world how good he looks in a kilt. He has demonstrated how easily he can arouse women of the Middle Ages Marceau and her handmaiden go giddy at the mere mention of his name. And yes he has guided this tale to completion. But now its time to put the pants back on and return to Los Angeles. Veteran detective Danny Glover who is still facing retirement needs help against an international terrorist ringor something like that.BRAVEHEART (R)  Contains sexual situations group male nudity and gruesome violence.

Not so in the 13th century when men were men and certainly not during the life of William Wallace the fierce Scottish lord whose rebellion against the English is the subject of Mel Gibsons hunk-driven historical epic ""Braveheart."" According to Gibsonwho functions as producer-director-star for this nearly three-hour movieand screenwriter Randall Wallace the great Scot is a hero in the Robin Hood mode. A common farmer who wants simply to be left alone to work his land Wallace has seen Edward I slaughter his countrys nobles tax its clansmen and claim the right to sleep with the brides of all Scotsmen on their first night of marriage. Even so Wallace does not initially join some of the others in their uprising against the king preferring to remain on the sidelines.Soon however the British attack his own familyincluding his childhood beloved (Catherine McCormack)and though Wallace may be slow to boil he makes up for it by hurling himself into battle with murderous abandon. In the process Wallace becomes one of the nations founding fatherslike Rob Royfollowed by a motley pickup army that sees him as a sort of living myth. Actually ""Braveheart"" might not have seemed quite so ordinaryor so monstrously longjust three months ago before the release of ""Rob Roy""; now its merely the second-best film about Scotland around. Both films are ostensibly historical romances; ""Braveheart"" though emphasizes the history over the romance. Gibson seems to have consciously chosen a character whose impulse toward action is the opposite of another of his recent rolesHamlet. Powerfully built with a wild mane of chestnut hair flying behind him Wallace is a simple uncomplicated man. Similarly the movie doesnt have any lofty ambitions. It is entertaining especially when the director sets his armies in motion against each other. These colorful lavishly violent battles are easily the movies most impressive scenes. In terms of sheer spectacle theyre expertly orchestrated in a manner that though not particularly original still manages to be both stirring and beautiful.Unfortunately the energy from these high points doesnt spill over into the rest of the movie. After Wallaces initial attempt to boot the Brits out of Scotland fails the movie cant quite get up to speed again. All thats left really is for Wallace to repeat himself by again winning the war on the battlefield only to lose it in the negotiations that follow. Gibson may be ambitious as a director and producer here but not as an actor. Though the character is immense Gibson keeps him human with an appealingly boyish performance. Hes obviously having a whale of a time with a character who not only speaks French Latin and Italian and romances an alluring French princess-turned-spy (Sophie Marceau) but also periodically wades thigh-deep into human gore. Wallaces defining characteristic is his intelligence; instead of simply overwhelming his foes he outfoxes them turning their superior size and inflexibility against them. But for a story whose hero is supposedly such a brain ""Braveheart"" doesnt seem to have much on its mind. The movie itself is very old-Hollywood in its casual mixing of historical and melodramatic elements. The costumes are the latest in medieval grunge the cinematography is expansive and transporting and the supporting cast outclasses the star (Patrick McGoohan as Edward and Marceau as the French Princess Isabelle are especially fun). In making ""Braveheart"" Gibson has proved that he is a competent director capable of handling ambitious projects with large casts and big production costs. He has created a completely adequate modern facsimile of the classic romantic epic. Braveheart is rated R.

Budget-busting historical blockbusters mostly belong to decades past when the leads were often more rigid than their armor. But as Scotlands William Wallace Gibson is crucially charismatic leading peasants against Englands Edward I (Patrick McGoohan) -- achieving remarkable success until lack of support by toadying countrymen restores the cruel kings advantage. Read more Related Complete Oscar coverage Just how cruel is demonstrated in the movies already controversial scene in which Edward heaves his effeminate sons so-called military adviser out a window to his death. If this is gay-bashing it is perpetrated by a despicable villain -- one whos also directly or indirectly responsible for the deaths of arguably the films two most appealing principals. With its exceedingly attractive co-stars (Sophie Marceau Catherine McCormack) Braveheart tempers moments of despair with deliriously romantic passages abetted by James Horners traditionally lush score and photography by John Toll (Legends of the Falls Oscar winner). Though lumpy and even redundant Braveheart constantly rebounds on some bold note. On balance director Gibson has delivered a real drum-banger and hasnt it been a while?

The same cant be said of Braveheart or Die Hard With a Vengeance the latest megabuck orgies of high-style machismo. Each works overtime to deliver its share of thriller bang and each features a star who radiates all the essential qualities of a contemporary action hero brawn daring a Zen cowboy ease -- and most important the uncanny ability to look good in blood. To different degrees though both films tread a fine line between exhilaration and exhaustion. Has a warrior ever looked as ecstatic about going into battle as Mel Gibson does in Braveheart? Chestnut mane streaming in the sun face slashed by zigzags of psychedelic blue war paint (hes as pretty as Robert Plant in his rock-god prime) Gibson plays William Wallace the 13th-century Scottish proletarian avenger who led his countrymen in a revolt against the English. Attempting to inspire his troops he gallops back and forth grinning like a demon and taunting the men into action. If the soldiers themselves are a trifle less enthused its with good reason Assembled across the field is the English army a vast marching band of death. William though is on fire -- he wants to stop these bastards -- and Gibson face lit by adrenaline makes you feel the pulse-quickening rush of war. He makes you feel it as a director too. Braveheart features some of the most enthralling combat sequences in years and the excessive ferocity of the violence is part of the thrill. This is a movie in which torsos get impaled crotches gouged and heads smashed like melons each action accompanied by the savage thwack of exploding bodily fluids. Gibson turns war into brutal poetic spectacle. The arrows fired by the English stream across the sky like choreographed flying twigs; moments later they rain down with shocking lethality. Then the Scots attack with homemade weapons long spears that resemble giant pencils and can pierce a soldier before hes close enough to strike. At moments like this the blood movement and sheer vastness of Braveheart evoke the violent excitement you remember from movies like Alexander Nevsky and The Seven Samurai. Then again an epic running time is no guarantee of an epic vision and Braveheart at nearly three hours doesnt always summon the drama to match its images of medieval combat. Gibsons William is a peasant farmer who wants nothing more than to live peacefully with his beautiful new wife (Catherine McCormack). When she is killed by the occupying British soldiers a nasty bunch who use sexual terrorism to keep the Scottish at bay William is transformed into a nihilist revolutionary. For him -- for Scotland -- it must now be liberty or death. As long as William is inspiring his men onto the battlefield Braveheart is stirring. But there are too many half-baked subplots infighting between William and the Scottish nobles the usual civilized treachery among the English (Patrick McGoohans King Edward I is convincingly evil without being especially colorful). Fortunately Gibson has little to learn about showcasing his own charisma. As William hes an enticing mixture of sinewy heroics and studly blue-eyed dazzle. The last hour of Braveheart is a bit of a slog but youll want to sit through it just to see Gibson subject himself to the splendidly masochistic executioners-block finale. It takes a real star to make suffering this sexy.
