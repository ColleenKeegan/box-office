Most attempts to resurrect the genre fall flat yet hope springs eternal if anybody were capable of pulling off this Lazarus act itd be George Clooney the guy with the old-school movie star looks and respect for old Hollywood? The fact that Clooney comes close with his anarchic American football farce only makes this well-intended throwback all the more frustrating. The movie gets lots of things right yet it fumbles key facets so badly that you simply cant christen it the gridiron version of His Girl Friday.To his credit the director-star evokes the early era of pro football with panache capturing the moment when the game went from a shysters paradise to a sanctioned industry. Clooney also knows how to channel the Gable-Cooper-McCrea charm like a champ. Its the dizzy dame in the love triangle who gums up the works. Playing a Hildy Johnson-style reporter Renee Zellweger cant reach screwball speed shes no Miriam Hopkins much less Barbara Stanwyck or Carole Lombard. Its a tall order but when Zellweger tries to attain motormouth velocity the pace falls three beats behind and everyone else scrambles to regain lost ground. In another comedy shed be a weak link. For this fast-talking team effort she is almost the kiss of death.

Other than the pleasing sepia visual effects the single dimensional central characters plodded through the thin storyline unable to lift our mood above the ""yes Im faintly amused but isnt this old tosh going on a bit?"" level.Nobody was convinced or even cared less that Georgeplaying a faded football quaterback was completely unsuited to the feckless investigative reporter played by Zelwegger.

I dont care what anyone thinks; Im not that old. But I did grow up in Wisconsin where the last of the small town teams the Green Bay Packers claimed my childish heart and to this day my aging one. Romantically -- and doubtless erroneously -- I continue to believe that todays insanely well-paid Packers (representing a franchise worth hundreds of millions) have some near-mystical connection with pro-footballs prehistoric days when if the players were lucky they might get fifty or a hundred bucks in return for getting their brains beaten out on Sunday afternoons. To put this matter simply I can imagine the soulful sublime and gun-slinging Brett Favre playing for the Duluth Bulldogs. Thats the name of the hard-pressed fictional franchise featured in George Clooneys Leatherheads in which the director stars as an aging wise-guy running back named Dodge Connolly who may have lost a few steps on the field but is yards ahead of most people in sensing pro footballs glittering future. That potential is personified by Carter Rutherford (John Krasinski) who has it all hes a war hero a snake-hipped runner and cute as all get out. He is a version of Red Grange who came out of Illinois signed a huge contract with the Chicago Bears and began the economic and social transformation of the game; the road to the Super Bowl started however primitively with Grange. In Leatherheads Rutherford is lightly brushed by scandal. And by Lexie Littleton (Renee Zellweger) a proto-feminist newspaper reporter intent on exposing (perhaps inventing would be a better word) a less-than-sterling Rutherford myth. She is of course smitten with him. And she banters fiercely with Connolly -- and anyone the least bit familiar with the basic tropes of romantic comedy has to know where that is heading. The course of true love is always charted by the exchange of zingers which in this case are pretty well written by Duncan Brantley and Rick Reilly. Indeed it seems to me the film works better as a comic love story than it does as a sports epic. In its early moments it features some good roughneck on-field shenanigans. The players are simple jocks content with playing a game of few loosely enforced rules. But as attention shifts from locker rooms to board rooms where the real struggle for control of the games bright yet much more respectable future is waged Leatherheads loses some of its formerly merry ways. It wants to make the case that there is more fun -- maybe more simple humanity -- to be found in the formative years of mighty enterprises (the movie business is an equally good example) before the sober men in suits take charge. This shift in tone is not entirely fatal to the movie for Clooneys coolly scheming charm remains intact and Zellweger gives as good as she gets in their exchanges. I also think that we are witnessing a star-making performance -- loose easy and avoiding the threat of smugness that lurks in his role -- from John Krasinski. Maybe the film loses a little steam as it rolls along but it is still puffing and tooting as Clooney and Zellweger ride off into the sunset -- on a comically raffish period motorcycle free as the wind.

Actually the first and last game I ever sat through during freshman year in college taught me one other thing -- that timing is everything. When the quarterback throws to a spot on the field the receiver had best be waiting there. Further the backs have to hit the holes before they close. Timing Is Everything. So in football so in comedy. Which brings us unavoidably to ""Leatherheads"" the disappointingly leaden if eager-to-please attempt by George Clooney the movies star and director to evoke the screwball comedies of Hawks Cukor and Sturges. Dodge Connolly (Mr. Clooney) is a former college gridiron champion with a 100-yard grin and moxie to spare. With graduation two decades behind him Dodge is trying to make pro football a going concern as captain of the ragtag Duluth Bulldogs. He and his rough and fumble cohorts are laughably ill-equipped from the footballs in their arsenal (teams tend to own exactly one pigskin) to fans (minimal) to sponsors (few and fleeting). Invariably the games which are at best improvisational affairs end in brawls. With the whole enterprise near collapse and in desperate need of a Hail Mary play Dodge finagles to secure the services of Carter Rutherford (the bland John Krasinski) an Ivy League star with real marquee value. Hes a war hero of mythic proportions -- or is he? Ambitious Chicago Tribune reporter and blond siren Lexie Littleton (Renee Zellweger who cant decide from scene to scene whether shes Rosalind Russell Carole Lombard or Veronica Lake and flops with them all) aims to ferret out the truth. ""Leatherheads""s flimsy premise wouldnt be such a problem if the movie had a sharper script star chemistry or shrewd direction. Unfortunately all are in short supply. The first meeting between Mr. Clooney and Ms. Zellweger in a hotel lobby sets the tone for all their dull subsequent matchups -- in a Pullman stateroom and speakeasy on a building ledge and motorcycle. You dont really buy a single strained word they say; in any case theyre both -- fatally -- a beat off. The conventions of the genre -- bumbling frantic action verbal pyrotechnic -- feel imposed rather than organic. Theres a jaunty score by Randy Newman and Clooney as always has charm to burn but here hes off his game. Shine a Light Director Martin Scorsese enlisted 18 cameras to record the fall 2006 Rolling Stones concert documented in the fluidly shot ""Shine a Light."" Seventeen of those cameras at New Yorks Beacon Theater surely must have been trained on the cappellini-skinny Mick Jagger. Almost in his mid-60s when the movie was shot he could still teach the Energizer Bunny a thing or three. He sweats and struts and runs around the stage as though in medal contention pumps the air with his arms and makes communing with the audience an aerobic activity. Hes caught coming and going -- and you are there. In between theres the music ""Lovin Cup"" ""You Got the Silver"" ""Satisfaction"" a particularly soulful version of ""As Tears Go By"" and appearances by Christina Aguilera Buddy Guy and Jack White among others. Bill Hillary and Chelsea Clinton and Grandma Rodham are among the audience members; the former president introduces the Stones with a little joke about how delighted he is to open for them. Aside from snippets of archival footage the concert consumes the movies two-hour running time. A prologue features Mr. Scorsese quite adorably fatootsed about the Stones refusal to settle once and for all on a play list to even let him know what theyve got in mind for their opening number. Some may argue that ""Shine a Light"" could have used more such flavoring. Stones fans wont be among them. Sex and Death 101 Roderick Blank (the charmless Simon Baker) is a fast food exec (who rarely seems to be working) and ladies man (whos always working the angles) in what is being billed as a black comedy by ""Heathers"" screenwriter Daniel Waters. But the crude sophomoric ""Sex and Death 101"" is neither particularly dark nor even remotely funny. In a little over a week the priapic Roderick will be putting away childish things -- unbridled desire one night stands -- and exchanging vows with his fiancee Fiona (Julie Bowen one of the movies many interchangeable bland blondes). But he re-thinks his wedding plans and his life when he receives a baffling email that turns out to be a list of all the women hes ever slept with as well as all the woman with whom hell be having the pleasure. Counting Fiona Roderick is at number 29. The roster ends at 101. You do the math. Blonde by brunette by redhead Roderick does what a mans got to do much to the vicarious delight of his married male buddies stock characters all and the bemusement of his lesbian assistant (Mindy Cohn). Rodericks lady-killer ways are being matched on the distaff side by those of a goth-clothed femme fatale (Winona Ryder) known as Death Nell (get it?). The ""sure thing"" is a bedrock male fantasy -- right up there with the fantasy of going to bed with a gorgeous woman and waking up alone. But Rodericks certainty of scoring every time he steps up to the plate eliminates any sense of suspense. What a bore both for him and the audience. His conquests are also totally without heat. Whats clear is that he isnt talking the women into bed not with dialogue whose apogee is reached with a joke about ""an embarrassment of bitches."" My Blueberry Nights Four very good actors are trapped in the boundlessly inane ""My Blueberry Nights"" the first English language feature by ""In the Mood for Love"" director Wong Kar Wai. Elizabeth (multi-Grammy winner Norah Jones in her film debut) has learned of her boyfriends perfidy from local cafe owner Jeremy (Jude Law) who has an uncanny memory for whos eating pork chops or meat loaf with whom and what side dishes are involved. For the record Ms. Jones is lovely to look at but has a way to go in the acting department. After several nights of listening to his pretty customers romantic woes and serving up blueberry pie a la mode and stilted dialogue Jeremy is smitten. Not that the anguished Elizabeth takes any notice. Shes too focused on her pain too eager to get away from bad memories. And so to the open road. She lands first in Memphis where while bartending she befriends alcoholic Arnie (David Strathairn) who cant get over his estranged wife (Rachel Weisz). Banality ensues. Then its on to Reno where she meets a poker player (a wonderfully fizzy Natalie Portman) whos busy pretending she doesnt care about her estrangement from her father. A failure to connect is the films chief preoccupation -- a fact underscored by its images of swift moving trains doors opening and closing characters peering at one another through windows. Alternately precious and vapid the movie attempts to wrest metaphors from a jar of house keys and eternal verities from pastry. Slice the pie how you will its still half-baked.    DVD TIP Barbara Stanwyck is a highly accomplished con artist who sets her sights on rich naive herpetologist Henry Fonda in Preston Sturgess delectable 1941 screwball comedy ""The Lady Eve.""

Though not as clever as the Preston Sturges or Howard Hawks movies to which it pays tribute it succeeds at what it sets out to be smart-alecky lightweight fun. The dialogue has the trademark rapid-fire banter in the style of the era and there is considerable chemistry between the long-in-the-tooth footballer played by George Clooney (who also directed) and the sassy reporter played by Renee Zellweger. VIDEO See a clip from Leatherheads Its a sports-themed romantic comedy set in the late 1920s during the early days of professional football. Clooney plays Dodge Connelly a brash and witty quarterback of a faltering football team. The bumbling players lose their sponsor and disband forced to take menial jobs. But the savvy Dodge is determined. Dreaming of packed stadiums he devises an idea to draw crowds Recruit a golden boy World War I hero and Ivy League gridiron star (John Krasinski) to ramp up his ragtag team. The boyishly handsome star of TVs The Office is just right for the role of Carter Rutherford who is widely hailed for forcing a platoon of German soldiers to surrender to him. Certain that theres more to his war story plucky reporter Lexie Littleton (Zellweger) hops aboard a train transporting the team and proceeds to pick Carters brain in a flirty if mannered style. Carter and Dodge are intrigued by her perky spitfire character and compete for her attention. But the ambitious Lexie is hellbent on getting her scoop. If this all sounds familiar thats the point. Its an amiable homage to such films as His Girl Friday and It Happened One Night and to director Clooneys credit there are no obvious anachronisms. The production design language and general attitudes stay faithful to the era. In contrast to his last directorial effort Good Night and Good Luck a period piece that was far more substantial Clooney is on much less weighty turf -- as both an actor and director -- with Leatherheads. His best performances have been in more powerful and complex movies such as Syriana and Michael Clayton. Though he did a fine job in Steven Soderberghs crime caper Out of Sight and hit all the right marks in the Oceans series his forte is not light comedy. Still he deserves credit for consistently tackling vastly different cinematic genres. Speaking of tackles brawling and fighting are a big part of this film. And several foot chases evoke images of the Keystone Kops. The film posits the notion that the once-freewheeling game of football has deteriorated as a spectator sport by becoming more rule-bound. More amiable than witty and relying heavily on the likability and charm of its lead actors Leatherheads scores more points as a retro romantic comedy than a football saga.

"Leatherheads Football flick fumbles | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsLeatherheads Football flick fumbles George Clooneys million-dollar smile blazes even when hes covered head-to-toe in mud.A tale of football? Love? Local war hero? Leatherheads cant quite decide.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. April 4 2008 Leatherheads (out of 4)Starring George Clooney Renee Zellweger John Krasinski and Jonathan Pryce. Directed by George Clooney. 113 minutes. At major theatres. PG George Clooneys million-dollar smile blazes even when hes covered head-to-toe in mud. This has its ups and downs much like the football that is the nominal focus of Leatherheads a weak throwback to the screwball comedies of the 30s and 40s.Clooney is now at the stage of his life and career where a flash of his playboy grin earns him enough audience goodwill to carry him over rough patches - and Lord knows this movie has them.At the same time though you can never get past the feeling that youre watching Clooney playing at making a movie rather than hunkering down and actually doing it.This is rarely a problem when hes doing a dramatic turn as Michael Clayton demonstrated with Oscar-nominated conviction.Put him into a situation where hes expected to get laughs though and Clooney turns cut-up unwilling to really earn his applause. This is magnified when hes also the director - Leatherheads marks his third time as helmer - since he has no one to tell him to dial it down.Word is that Leatherheads delayed from a fall 2007 release has been kicking around Clooneys junk drawer for at least a decade. He originally planned to have pal Steven Soderbergh direct it. You have to think that Soderbergh might have done a better job.Soderbergh would surely have at least figured out what kind of movie he was making. Would it be a true screwball homage? Or should it really be a drama since there are two big subplots the encroachment of big business on the noble gridiron pastime and the story of a soldier whose nationally lauded World War I heroics suddenly become hard to verify.Its 1925 and Clooney is Dodge Connelly an aging jock in Duluth Minn. who cant keep his hands off the pigskin. He plays old-school football which had no firm rules - but hes smart enough to know that the game is turning pro and bringing with it big money and tough restrictions.His most immediate concern is the survival of the Duluth Bulldogs who are having trouble drawing fans. Dodges plan is to recruit star player and war hero Carter ""The Bullet"" Rutherford (John Krasinski from TVs The Office). But Bullet is already playing for a Princeton team and also using his hero status to flog toothpaste razors and cigarettes. He wont be easy to get especially with his rapacious manager (Jonathan Pryce) doing the negotiations.Enter gal reporter Lexie Littleton (Renee Zellweger) sent by her Chicago newspaper to do a major expose on Rutherford. Rumour has it he seriously fudged his account of how he single-handedly took on a trench full of German soldiers.The repartee between Clooney and Zellweger seems manufactured and exaggerated like theyre posing for a photo spread in Vanity Fair. A cheesy soundtrack that includes hoary ditties like ""Toot Toot Tootsie"" and ""Hold That Tiger"" doesnt help.The prospect of a three-way love tussle similarly fails to improve the Leatherheads box score. Dodge and Bullet are both sweet on Lexie but neither is committed enough to really fight about it.Even the inevitable gridiron showdown fails to rouse. It all seems to come down to Dodges belief that the only way to keep football fun is to cheat. Thats probably not the message Clooney intends to send us home with but Leatherheads manages to fumble all its signals.

Starring George Clooney Renee Zellweger and John Krasinski. Directed by George Clooney. (PG-13. 114 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. ""Leatherheads"" is not that good a movie and yet it would be hard to enjoy saying anything nasty about it. Imagine a really nice jolly genial person with a mild intermittent hygiene problem. This movie is a little like that. It exudes goodwill and high spirits occasionally makes you feel really good and yet here and there and in some definite ways it kinda sorta stinks. So first please lets emphasize the positive which in this case has to do with almost everything about ""Leatherheads"" except the story and overall tone. Its not enough to say that the world of this picture - set in the nascent days of professional football in the mid-1920s - is attractive and appealing. Its also expertly and artfully realized. One of the movies first shots is of a football stadium as seen from the field and its stunning a vision in sepia and earth tones a mix of reality memory and myth. The effect is like being catapulted back to 1925 but even more like being catapulted into a 1925 dream. George Clooney who also stars in the movie directed it and he seems to have made a conscious choice to present the past as the past; that is to remind us in every possible subtle way that this is a world thats gone. Its quite likely that something in 1925 was blue or green but in ""Leatherheads"" everything is brown brick or a rusty yellow. The movie looks like the inside of some abandoned private library. Its cozy and makes a viewer nostalgic for coziness. Clooney plays Dodge a veteran pro football player at a time when teams were folding for lack of fans. He devises a scheme to revitalize pro football and put it over with the public once and for all by signing Carter (John Krasinski) the countrys No. 1 college player to his Duluth team. Carter is not just a star athlete. Hes also a war hero and a national idol who does print advertisements for everything from cigarettes to razor blades. Most of the movie takes place on the road and focuses on the odd trio the old pro the young star ... and Lexie a hotshot gal reporter from the big city played by Renee Zellweger. While pretending to be everybodys friend albeit in a smart-aleck way Lexie is really out to bring down Carter. She wants to prove that Carter wasnt a big war hero that hes just a big fraud. Like Clooney himself ""Leatherheads"" is easy to take. Clooney may not penetrate the deep places that Clint Eastwood does but like Eastwood he directs himself with an intelligent understanding of his own appeal and meaning as an actor. He knows just how important he is and how important he isnt which indicates a consciousness unclouded by stardom. Clearly theres something in Clooney that really wants to be a great American filmmaker or at least a rescuer of lost Americana. This is evident in the exuberant Randy Newman score full of period references and also in the ... love (theres no other word for it) that Clooney lavishes on his characters. But Clooney drops the ball when he injects notes of screwball and slapstick into the proceedings. At that point ""Leatherheads"" becomes a mishmash of styles reminiscent of Peter Bogdanovich at his worst and soon everybodys having a great time except the audience. Then again it might just be that Clooney is trying to distract from a script that loses all dramatic tension and that fragments after an hour. Louise Frogleys costume designs are authentic and flattering. Zellweger looks great done up like Norma Shearer in ""Lady of the Night."" Frogley must have screened that 1925 picture because there are stylistic echoes throughout wool stockings hats with feathers caps for the men. No question ""Leatherheads"" is pleasant and pleasing enough to watch which is no small thing to say for a movie. But its not quite enough to constitute a recommendation. -- Advisory This film contains brief strong language.

Leatherheads (PG-13) Universal (114 min.) Directed by George Clooney. With Clooney Renee Zellweger John Krasinski. Opens Friday at theaters in New Jersey. TWO STARS Like the Jazz Age football players it idolizes George Clooneys ""Leatherheads"" sets a good pace holds on to a can-do spirit and has a lot of heart. Also like them -- unfortunately -- its not quite as good as it needs to be or thinks it is. Clooneys latest job as a director is a change-up from the deliberately disconnected ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" and fierce focused ""Good Night and Good Luck."" It has some of their interests (Americana entertainment) and some of their concerns (morality the media). This time however Clooney wants to wrap them up in a big package of screwball comedy and nostalgia handsome men in hats and gorgeous dames with comebacks. Full of jazzy music on the soundtrack and speakeasy scenes swimming in bathtub gin its meant to be ""The Front Page"" with pigskin ""The Sting"" in cleats. Its just that with all his attention to detail Clooney somehow left out the fun. The story is set in 1925 when college football was a popular sport but for some reason pro football was merely a joke. Clooney plays Dodge Connelly a fortyish dinosaur who has a simple idea Why not get an investor and just hire Princetons gridiron hero to join his hard-luck team and add a little glamour? Of course it doesnt work out quite as simply as intended. Clooney looks terrific as Dodge and obviously enjoys the few smart lines the script provides him with but hes still unwilling to push himself as a comic actor too willing to mug and pull faces. And while John Krasinski is sweetly big and dopey as the Princeton star the script never gives him the chance to do much more. Worse Renee Zellweger is all wrong as the ""girl reporter"" on the scene. For one her hair is out of step for 25; for another a character who keeps bragging about her ""great gams"" should show em. (Carole Lombard sure would have.) Zellweger has one nicely sarcastic bit of flirting with Clooney early on but their love scenes never catch fire. The story has its own problems. Some are simply chronological. (Even with time out for World War I why is the smart Krasinski still an undergraduate in 1925?) Others are more thematic. Its clear that the movie wants to draw a line between early football and whats to come and to stand on the side of the old mud-and-guts athletes. But whats its real point? Yes the new professionalism brought merchandising bureaucrats and rules. But werent some of those rules good? And wouldnt most people -- particularly a liberal like Clooney -- be glad the players now had agents lawyers protection? Ultimately though the movie -- like a bad throw -- simply falls short. The comedy is less sharp Howard Hawks than clumsy John Ford (lots of guys getting socked in the jaw and spinning around with silly looks on their faces); the plot is confusing without ever being complicated (why does rich villain Jonathan Pryce even need Clooneys character?) Yes its a beautiful looking movie with handsome people. But it fumbles -- early -- and never really gets back in the game. Rating note The film contains some strong language and comic violence.

Especially when ""Leatherheads"" the first film Clooneys directed where he plays the lead is in the notoriously difficult genre of romantic comedy - and he tries to revive the vintage screwball variety on top of that. This doesnt always work but sometimes its quite funny and 12 will buy you yards of the Clooney charm - plus some great sight gags and terrific period sets and costumes gorgeously photographed by Newton Thomas Sigel and accompanied by a jazzy Randy Newman score. The period is the Roaring 20s and the romance is played out against the early years of professional football a rowdy ruleless sport that was far less popular than the collegiate variety. Clooney plays Dodge Connelly an aging World War I veteran whos the captain of a rag-tag team in Duluth Minn. When the franchises sponsor pulls the plug he comes up with the brilliant idea of poaching Carter Rutherford (John Krasinski) a hugely popular star at Princeton known as ""The Bullet."" Enter romantic complications in the form of Lexie Littleton (Renee Zellweger) whos been dispatched by her editor in Chicago to discredit Carters supposed role as a World War I hero. Lexie plans to use her feminine wiles on Carter but her pass gets intercepted by Clooneys Dodge - and they agreeably trade insults as Carters manager (Jonathan Pryce) who also covets Lexie lurks in the background. Clooney is trying for an homage to classics such as ""His Girl Friday"" but he often fumbles the necessary breathless pace in a film that ideally would have been something like 20 minutes shorter. The star-director and his credited screenwriters - Duncan Brantley and Rick Reilly of Sports Illustrated - dont seem to have ended up on the same page though theyve been developing it together for something like 10 years. The lovingly detailed sports background - and hints of the big business that pro sports was eventually to become - is constantly threatening to overwhelm the romantic comedy or at least put the brakes on it. Occasionally Clooneys direction achieves the antic mayhem of the Coen brothers ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" while deploying the same self-deprecating slapstick in his performance - most notably in an extended brawl in a speak-easy followed by a hasty escape. Its certainly easier to take than Clooney and the Coens joint attempt at screwball comedy ""Intolerable Cruelty."" Thats partly due to Zellweger who can often seem mannered but here delivers an entirely credible variation on Rosalind Russell. Krasinski (of TVs ""The Office"") is pretty much a cipher - too young for romantic scenes with Zellweger and too slight to beat up Clooney. But Clooney backs him up with a well-chosen roster of character actors - most notably Peter Gerety who takes charge of the flicks weaker second half as the first NFL commissioner. ""Leatherheads"" is far from a touchdown but you gotta give points to any movie where a character describes its climactic game as a ""muddy snoozefest."" lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next PREGNANT MAN VISITS OPRAH Read Next PREGNANT MAN VISITS OPRAH Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 31723 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 27400 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 16608 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Screwball comedy about a reporter torn between two football players in 1925. With George Clooney Renee Zellweger John Krasinski. Director George Clooney (144). PG-13 Language violence. At area theaters.In recent years George Clooney has become the Ultimate Movie Star a guy who can do virtually no wrong. Given the acclaim he has earned as a filmmaker alone - for ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" and ""Good Night and Good Luck"" - its something of a surprise that he fumbles his latest attempt behind the camera. Apparently even icons have their limits. And with ""Leatherheads"" Clooney may simply have stretched himself too thin by serving as both director and his own leading man. Here he plays aging jock Dodge Connolly a 1920s football player watching his ragtag league buckle under flagging interest. Threatened further by rules designed to end the sports anarchic spirit a desperate Dodge hires Carter (The Bullet) Rutherford (ever-likable John Krasinski). A war hero admired by men and adored by women Carter perfectly represents the new face of professional football. Meanwhile ace reporter Lexie Littleton (Renee Zellweger) is shadowing Carter wherever he goes determined to find some dirt on Americas squeaky-clean star. Before long both guys are making eyes at our gal and when Carter signs with a better team they become rivals on and off the field. Its easy to see what Clooneys going for but hard to understand the choices he makes. Just when we think he has settled into a witty homage to the great comedies of Hollywoods golden age he indulges in self-conscious slapstick. He - and his screenwriters former Sports Illustrated journalists Duncan Brantley and Rick Reilly - seem to have genuine affection for the good old days of unregulated chaos but rarely create any rousing action. As for romance Zellweger bounces helplessly between two men who dont suit her while struggling mightily with a full lineup of rat-a-tat banter. Frankly she shouldnt have to compete with the ghosts of Rosalind Russell and Carole Lombard as Clooney forces her to do. Its one thing to evoke the Champagne sophistication of the screwball era; its another to try to emulate it. Inevitably the harder you work at capturing madcap fizz the flatter things are going to feel. eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Leatherheads (PG-13) 1/2 | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies Leatherheads (PG-13) 1/2 Leatherheads is a game effort that runs into overtime. Photo Universal Pictures Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez Miami Herald In Leatherheads director George Clooney proves all the Cary Grant/Clark Gable comparisons right by casting himself in the kind of crowd-pleasing entertainment Grant and Gable made throughout their careers. Essentially a screwball comedy with a sports theme the movie takes a comic look at the birth of Americas pro football league in 1925 when players shared the field with grazing cows and a turnout of 20 people was considered by team owners to be a good day. As a way of saving the dying league (as well as his paycheck) middle-aged Jimmy Dodge Connelly (Clooney) captain of the Duluth Bulldogs recruits popular war hero Carter The Bullet Rutherford (John Krasinski) to play for his team hoping Carter will attract the same crowds he currently draws to college ball games. The ploy works but it also attracts the attention of newspaper reporter Lexie Littleton (Renee Zellweger) who is working on an expose revealing Carters wartime heroics were more luck and circumstance than actual bravery. If Zellweger cant quite muster the brassy charm of Rosalind Russell or Katharine Hepburn the Front Page subplot does give her and Clooney several scenes of rapid-fire give-and-take bickering. The plentiful one-liners in the script written by Duncan Brantley and Sports Illustrated columnist Rick Reilly dont achieve the memorable wit and instant quotability of golden-age Hollywood but they come close enough. Leatherheads alternates between the aforementioned screwball tone and the broader slapsticky humor of a Three Stooges short. Clooney has obviously been influenced by his frequent directors Joel and Ethan Coen (O Brother Where Art Thou? Intolerable Cruelty) -- Leatherheads often looks and feels like one of the brothers shaky comedies -- but even if the movie doesnt always negotiate the changes in tone with grace it never completely wipes out either. This is the third film Clooney has directed after Confessions of a Dangerous Mind and Good Night and Good Luck and the range of the three pictures is indicative of Clooneys refusal to coast on his star power. Leatherheads goes on a good 20 minutes too long and theres very little in it that makes a lasting impression but its easy to watch while its unspooling -- much like you know a lot of Cary Grant comedies.

Set in the 1920s golden-boy war hero Dodge Connolly (George Clooney) recruits a college football star to join his team. Photo Handout Leatherheads 1 / 2 Back to Gallery In his directorial career George Clooney has made three films a good one (Confessions of a Dangerous Mind) a great one (Good Night and Good Luck) and a throwback. Youll either get Leatherheads or you wont. Even if you do get it you might wish it had a bit more pop to its dialogue a bit more pep to its story. You might long for more and better football scenes. You might spend the drive home with your family debating which brassy actress should have played the heroine instead of Renee Zellweger (Cate Blanchett? No Reese Witherspoon) and why Zellwegers face was mummified under 18 layers of cosmetics (To make her look older? No stranger). Thats if you get it. If you dont get it you could die of boredom. I speak as the most nerdishly devoted of old-movie buffs. I adore all those classic 1930s and 1940s comedies from Howard Hawks and Frank Capra and Preston Sturges and various Georges (Cukor Stevens) anything with a sharp dame a couple of swell men vying for her and a rat-a-tat script full of screwball laughs and well-aimed zingers. And I like this George too with that razor-fine part to his hair and the menschy air of self-deprecation that he always manages to pull off - no matter which side of the camera hes on. In Leatherheads he plays Dodge Connelly aging captain of the down-and-out 1925 Duluth Bulldogs a professional football squad in an era when ``professional football implied a type of mud-packed anarchy ungoverned by fair play or even most of the time rules. The Bulldogs are plumb out of money when Dodge gets a brilliant idea bring in the star player from the booming college-football scene to perk up admission make piles of money and raise the profile of pro football everywhere. As it happens the star player is one Carter ""The Bullet Rutherford (John Krasinski) a war hero who earned the medal of honor for nabbing an entire platoon of Germans in an Argonne foxhole. As it also happens swank blonde reporter Lexie Littleton (Zellweger) has been assigned to interview Carter flirt with him use those fine legs of hers to melt his resistance - and get the real scoop on his time in the Great War. Gumming up this scheme is Dodge whos sweet on Lexie and expresses it (as all screwball heroes must) through glib verbal sniping. The plot unfolds with boozy arguments pretty kissing wild brawls messy football games and one deliciously slapstick flight from a prohibition speakeasy. Clooney mugs and shakes his head. Krasinski oozes niceness. Zellweger cocks her cigarette like a weapon. As a director and as a star Clooney makes new movies with an obvious reverence for old ones. I get the sense hes the biggest film nerd of all and I love this about him. If he admits in interviews that Leatherheads purposely invokes The Philadelphia Story and other chestnuts - hey OK by me. Anytime he wants to dig up the long-lost greats of cinema Id be happy to hand him a shovel. But theres a hitch. If a guy plans to ape past styles of filmmaking he has to ape them perfectly. Getting it half right doesnt work putting a lanky man in a drunk scene doesnt make him Jimmy Stewart; putting a stylish woman between two men doesnt make her Katharine Hepburn. Duncan Brantleys and Rick Reillys screenplay rattles off period slang with the honky-tonk moxie of Randy Newmans score (look for Newman as a bottle-smashing piano player) but Leatherheads never quite sounds like a classic. It lacks the energy of those circa-1940 films - the overlapping dialogue the dizzy verbosity the speed. No ones voice has that proper saucy edge to it the timbre of smart people misbehaving at breakneck pace. Everyones too mannered and most everythings too slow.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor April 4 2008 Save for later Saved About video ads View Caption of George Clooney plays an over-the-hill football stalwart from the 1920s in ""Leatherheads"" but theres nothing over the hill about his screen presence. Even in a middling comedy such as this one which he also directed hes alarmingly ardent. Clooney is relying on the tremendous audience rapport hes built up over the years and hes right to do so.Clooneys Dodge Connelly has been kicking around the sport for years without attracting much in the way of fans or sponsorships. His team the Duluth Bulldogs consists of brawlers who otherwise work light jobs like coal-mining. The only reason these guys play the game is because they love it - or to be more precise because they love colliding with each other.This is after all the pro football era when you were considered a sissy if you threw a pass instead of charging through the line. College football however was another story. The best college players were genuine stars and their games were highly publicized. The conceit of ""Leatherheads"" is that pro football became big in America by poaching from the colleges. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Enter Princeton football star and decorated war hero Carter ""The Bullet"" Rutherford (John Krasinski from TVs ""The Office""). Dodge attempts to bail out his collapsing league by securing Carters services. But Carters war exploits - he claims to have single-handedly wiped out an entire German battalion in World War I - come in for scrutiny when gum-chewing ace newspaper reporter Lexie (Renee Zellweger) in her scarlet dress is put on the case. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Football turns screwball in Leatherheads This is all a bit cutesy. Clooney is great fun to watch as the hard headed conniving Dodge but his instincts as a director are too broad. Hes trying to combine two genres the old-time sports movie and the vintage newspaper comedy.First-time screenwriters Rick Reilly and Duncan Brantley once worked together at Sports Illustrated and they capture a bit of the swagger and camaraderie of the gridiron life. But they cant really duplicate though they try the tone and spirit of their chief model Howard Hawkss ""His Girl Friday.""The filmmakers love of those old movies is everywhere apparent in ""Leatherheads"" but they cant do much more than reference them. They cant create an entity that stands on its own except as a newfangled ""tribute."" Why see the new movie when you can rent the old one?The answer is To see Clooney and company. If anybody else had starred in ""Leatherheads"" it might have seemed like a lunkheaded vanity production. But Clooney both as actor and director invests the film with a friendliness that makes it entertaining even if youve seen it all before. Clooney is saying You havent seen it all with me and to prove it he takes a big-kid glee in romping through the gridiron and getting caked with mud.The flat-out squareness of this movie takes some getting used to. Clooney doesnt just make a movie set in the 20s he also films many of its sequences in the static straight-ahead style of that era. As a movie star hes amazingly malleable because he incarnates the Golden Era glamour of Hollywood while also being indubitably modern. This is why he is able to come across so well in period pieces - he never seems out of place. In the Coen Brothers ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" the American past was refracted through the filmmakers weirdo prism and Clooney fit right in with it just as he looked at home in period movies as disparate as ""Good Night and Good Luck"" (which he also directed) and ""The Good German"" not to mention the modern-day ""Michael Clayton"" with its neo-Bogart tonality.Clooney seems aware in his movies of his retro-ness and he uses it with comic effect in ""Leatherheads."" Its a pleasant time-killer nothing more. But nothing less either. Grade B Rated PG-13 for brief strong language.

The setting is 1925 Duluth home base of the Bulldogs a rough-and-ready pro football team in an era when pay was low glamour was nil and rulebooks were rarely consulted. The only audience at the Bulldogs practice field is a bemused cow and the turnout for their games is scarcely larger or more enthusiastic. Dodge Connolly (George Clooney) the teams irrepressible quarterback and manager boosts the games entertainment value with bizarre plays like the Rin Tin Tin The left wide receiver howls like a scalded hound while you snap the ball right. Still the crowds are thin and the team is so cash-strapped they shower in their uniforms to save laundry fees. When Princeton football star Carter ""The Bullet"" Rutherford (John Krasinski) plays his final college game Dodge entices him to join the teetering Bulldogs for a percentage of the gate promoting him as the sports first superstar. Not only is he a lightning bolt on the field hes famed for capturing a platoon of German infantrymen single-handed. Following Rutherford is Lexie Littleton (Renee Zellweger) a feisty Chicago Tribune reporter ostensibly covering ""The Bullets"" career but actually investigating his story of battlefield heroism. Soon the Ivy League golden boy and the aging roustabout are romantic rivals grappling for Lexies heart like a mud-slicked pigskin. Clooney radiates rakish charm making himself the butt of jokes about his advancing age and including a comic stunt that echoes his recent motorcycle accident. And those endless comparisons to Cary Grant are deserved. Look at the way he uses his eyes in the scene when he first catches sight of Zellweger in a hotel lobby. They have a great rapport; their sharp-tongued comic banter feels effortless. Theres a hint of Marx brothers madness in one scene as Dodge and Lexie squabbling in a double-berth sleeping car snap the curtains open and shut as each tries for the last indignant word. Krasinski is solid as a straight arrow with troubling memories although he never measures up as serious romantic competition. Jonathan Pryce adds suave menace as Carters unscrupulous agent and Stephen Root makes off with most of his scenes as a tippling sports reporter. LEATHERHEADS  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for brief strong language. ""Leatherheads"" Clooneys third outing as a director extends his range beyond the showbiz absurdism of ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" and the political drama of ""Good Night and Good Luck."" Clooney who co-wrote the film is unabashed in his affection for period Americana and old-school filmmaking and recreates it with impressive technical polish. He fills the screen with quaint Tin Lizzies and raccoon coats and paces his chat-a-tat-tat dialog scenes with Roaring Twenties momentum. The score is an upbeat blend of vintage tunes and new ragtime from Randy Newman. Still Clooney missed one crucial lesson from 1930s comedies Keep it short. At an hour and 54 minutes ""Leatherheads"" often lopes when it should race with dead-weight scenes and extraneous subplots. The anachronistic dialogue sometimes feels exhumed rather than adapted for modern audiences. Drawing from movies rather than life ""Leatherheads"" often feels like a likable exercise in retro style rather than a film with a compelling reason to exist on its own.

Problem is it isnt breakneck enough. Clooney the closest thing modern Hollywoods got to Clark Gable bats his lashes wrinkles his brow and woos coos and dukes it out with wiseguy charm. Set in 1925 in the wild woolly early days of professional football when teams were sponsored by starch companies and turnout was good if 200 fans huddled in the bleachers Leatherheads is an admirable if not altogether successful affair. Clooney and leading lady RenA(c)e Zellweger as a tough-cookie reporter with a Veronica Lake coif and a Claudette Colbert attitude play off each other nicely. And The Offices John Krasinski in the role of a college gridiron star and war hero lured to the pros has the lanky comportment and aw-shucks decency of a young Jimmy Stewart. But someone should have held a stopwatch up while Clooney - in his third outing as director - shot his scenes or kicked the cast in the shins to get them hoppin. With the exception of a few sassy exchanges between Clooney and Zellweger (their first meeting with Clooney pretending to be immersed in a copy of the Ladies Home Journal is a hoot) the action and arch dialogue feel a beat-and-a-half too long. Even the football games - with the teams in knickers and baggy jerseys blocking and tossing on messy turf - arent fleet of foot. Loaded with vintage cars one very cool motorbike with sidecar and scores of extras in 20s hats and coats Leatherheads is nothing if not affectionate as it pays homage to pictures like It Happened One Night and The Palm Beach Story. The set of a trains sleeping car shared by Clooneys Dodge Connolly and Zellwegers Lexie Littleton (even the names are retro) has walls that bob up down and sidewise. The curtains of the couples berths fly open and shut as the stars parry their quips and quip their parries. If the Keystone Kops police chase through a hotel after Dodge and Lexie are rousted from an illegal gin joint appears clunky and cartoonish the payoff is sublime a joke about suicide jumpers dark and funny provides the perfect getaway. Leatherheads isnt all its cracked up to be and its neo-nostalgic look at the anything-goes era of pro football - before rules and regulations dulled up the game - feels kind of fake. But if you have a hankering for old-style Hollywood comedy and romance and Turner Classic Movies is on a Steve McQueen or John Wayne jag Leatherheads offers an agreeable substitute. Leatherheads 1/2 (out of four stars) Directed by George Clooney. With George Clooney John Krasinski Jonathan Pryce and RenA(c)e Zellweger. Distributed by Universal Pictures.

Yes evidently. A well-meaning period piece about the birth of professional football war service journalism maybe a little feminism thrown in there somewhere all filtered through the lens of screwball comedy . . . you get the idea. A few of the ingredients are interesting enough on their own but theres way too much going on to come up with a coherent whole. Clooney directs and stars as Jimmy ""Dodge"" Connelly an aging pro gridder at a time - 1925 - when the game was played in cow pastures. But the college game thats where the passion and the crowds were. And thats where Carter Rutherford (John Krasinski) stars at Princeton. He took time off to fight in World War I where he single-handedly captured Germans by the mere sound of his voice. Or did he? Thats the scoop Lexie Littleton (Rene Zellweger) is out to uncover for the Chicago Tribune. Dodge meanwhile has cooked up a scheme to salvage the professional game Sign Rutherford to a contract giving the league the boost in publicity and ticket sales it needs to remain solvent an idea that appeals to Rutherfords greedy manager CC Frazier (the reliable Jonathan Pryce). The various threads come together except when they dont. Theres no real flow to the story (the script is by former Sports Illustrated writers Duncan Brantley and Rick Reilly); the game gets left behind for a big chunk as Lexie tries to ferret out the truth behind Rutherfords heroism. Meanwhile Rutherford is falling for Lexie - as is of course Dodge. Oh and Congress has appointed a commissioner to clean up professional football just in time for Dodges teams big game (cleaning anything up hurts the teams chances considerably). Clooney the director works in a manner similar to Dodge the football player. He is willing to cede the spotlight to Krasinski at least for a time. And Krasinski - best known as Jim on the U.S. version of The Office - gives a good performance making Rutherford a likable fellow who isnt quite the golden boy the world believes him to be but not that far from it either. Zellweger isnt exactly Rosalind Russell in His Girl Friday; shes too broad to be believable snapping off quips as she horns in on the boys club of sportswriters but going over the top is part of playing this kind of role. Unfortunately thats what Clooney does least well. Hes a gifted and underrated actor especially in dramatic roles. (Watch him in Michael Clayton; the subtle touches that hint at the characters desperation are played just right.) But when he goes into bug-eyed double-take mode Clooneys acting becomes too obvious. You can see him sweating the details large and small. For an actor whose charm depends in large part on an unerring sense of cool thats deadly. As director Clooney tries to make the best use possible of the plot strands. Leatherheads gets the look of a screwball comedy right; you imagine if they shot them in color back in the day the warm glow of a movie poster come to life is what would have shown up on screen as it does here. And Randy Newmans score is delightful (Newman does a cameo a piano player in a speakeasy). But its too much homage too little heart. If Leatherheads followed just one or two of the paths it meanders down it could have been a much better film. Instead its the equivalent of a busted play with the players scrambling in different directions making any kind of forward progress nearly impossible.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.April 3 2008 1157 AM Illegal Use of Hands George Clooneys pro-football comedy Leatherheads. By Dana Stevens Leatherheads Leatherheads (Universal) George Clooneys third outing as a director and the first in which he plays a starring role has everything going for it on paper. Setting a screwball comedy against the backdrop of the emergence of professional football in the 1920s sounds like a rollicking idea. The period songs and costumes are as jaunty as can be. And the casting of Clooney our eras Clark Gable as aging football star Dodge Connolly is a natural. So why does the whole thing feel sloggier than the climactic game a near-scoreless battle waged in a lake of mud? Much as Id like to I cant put all the blame on Renee Zellweger. Ive always had an animus toward this actress with her self-congratulatory cuteness and incessant mugging. But I have to admit shes nicely cast as spunky newspaper reporter Lexie Littleton who begins to follow Dodges team the Duluth Bulldogs after they recruit a popular college player Carter Rutherford (John Krasinski). Carter is also a WWI hero known for having single-handedly captured a whole company of German soldiers in the battle of the Argonne. Lexies editor (Jack Thompson) finds the whole story suspicious and puts Lexie on Carters trail. Lexies initial strategy in the grand pre-feminist Barbara Stanwyck style is to seduce Carter into spilling the beans about what really happened in the war. But George Clooney being George Clooney--all the more so in a speakeasy--she can concentrate only so long on that skinny guy from The Office. Advertisement Leatherheads overlong middle section is devoted to the vagaries of the Dodge/Lexie/Carter love triangle as Clooney and Zellweger exchange semi-snappy banter while the hopelessly upstaged Krasinski moons on the sidelines. It was enough to make this sports-averse viewer wish for a little more pigskin. Its fascinating to learn that pro football as we know it is a relatively new sport and that as recently as the mid-1920s the game was unregulated poorly attended and on the verge of bankruptcy (even as college football drew huge audiences). The movie nostalgically contrasts Dodges disappearing version of the game--essentially a barroom brawl between two goalposts--with Carters emerging one an efficient business dependent on advertising money. But the script--which was written by two Sports Illustrated reporters with a long history of covering football--seems reluctant to explore this contrast perhaps for fear of alienating its female audience. Personally Id have preferred to see more of the backroom tactics of the nations first football commissioner (an arresting Peter Gerety) and less of Zellweger pouting in period hats. Still Leatherheads is better than a finger in your eye. Its a perfectly passable if instantly forgettable date movie lushly shot by Newton Thomas Sigel and with a script intelligently versed in American classics like His Girl Friday and Hail the Conquering Hero. Maybe Clooney has just raised our expectations too high with his uninterrupted ascent from ""that dude on E.R."" to respected lefty director/producer (by way of Messenger of Peace and Sexiest Man Alive). At this point in his career hes earned the right to make a movie thats just OK. If Clooneys contemplating going retro again for his next project may I suggest a remake of It Happened One Night? Reese Witherspoon would make a fine latter-day Claudette Colbert and instead of just going bare-chested as Gable famously did Clooney could guarantee big box office by taking it all off.

The archetypes are in place Renee Zellwegers ambitious gal reporter Lexie Littleton; Clooneys roguish football player/entrepreneur Dodge Connelly whos scheming to resurrect his defunct team by recruiting Princetons poster-boy war hero Carter Rutherford (John Krasinski) to pack the stands. Both men take a shine to Lexie but shes got her own agenda to expose Carters battlefield heroics as a sham.The last movie Clooney directed ""Good Night and Good Luck"" was an urgent tribute to journalistic integrity. Oddly there isnt a shred of urgency about ""Leatherheads."" Nothing much is at stake the romantic triangle is no contest from the get-go and Lexies ambition heavily built up in Duncan Brantley and Rick Reillys script is pretty much forgotten about. ""Leatherheads"" also wants us to mourn the passing of the anarchic rough-and-tumble pro-football scene before it became a rule-bound efficient business but Clooney exhibits so little interest in football that he forgets to show us what was so good about the good old gridiron days. The great 30s comedies had edge bite and relentless forward momentum. ""Leatherheads"" is laid-back amiable and terminally tepid.

Thats also how he became a walking American character ideal with a responsible carbon footprint and a villa in Italy. Clooney appears to be a guy who knows how not to sweat the small stuff while making his commitment to big stuff look really exciting Michael Clayton Syriana Good Night and Good Luck; humanitarian activism in Darfur; nontraditional energy-saving automobiles. But when he takes on comic Rat Pack-y projects that overtly tweak his own marketable suaveness -- O Brother Where Art Thou? Oceans Eleven through Thirteen -- something vexing happens. Thats when this coolest of cats looks like hes trying too hard. Reproducing a period-piece screwball comedy for a modern audience turns out to be one playful self-deprecating wink too many for the star who also directed Leatherheads -- with what may have been only vague awareness going in of just how difficult it is to control the speed and bounce of a successful screwball trajectory. In this slowest of ostensibly madcap romps Clooney strains at the chin strap as Dodge Connolly an athletic scrapper at play on the field and off. Leatherheads is set during the early days of pro football circa 1925 before big money and damn rules changed and the movie argues ruined the game. (The script is credited to former Sports Illustrated writers Duncan Brantley and Rick Reilly -- pros at covering college football but not so much at screenwriting. Since the first draft dating back to the early 1990s a lot of hands have touched the ball among them Clooneys own.) Dodge loves a playful brawl a snoot full of drink and a great dame. And the dame hes got his eye on is Lexie Littleton (Renee Zellweger) a snappy news hen from the His Girl Friday school of gal reporters with a nifty wardrobe in shades of red. Lexie meanwhile has her investigative eye on Carter Rutherford (John Krasinski) a straight-arrow college football hero with an impossibly noble WWI record recently recruited by Dodge to boost spectator numbers for his struggling pro team the Duluth Bulldogs. While she sniffs out inconsistencies in Carters battlefield stories this tough honey also finds herself attracted to the big fellow. Why not? Its Krasinskis irresistible Jim Halpert from The Office redux with a bonus of athletic prowess. And so Leatherheads plays out in a sequence of romantic rivalries on-field scuffles backroom maneuvers (many of them involving Jonathan Pryce as Carters slick sports agent) chastely sexy moments of flirtation and wacky digressions meant to simulate the mechanics of the original 30s and 40s comedies by George Cukor Lewis Milestone and Howard Hawks to which Leatherheads doffs its helmet. Reportedly Clooney himself really pushed for more spring to the screwball quotient -- the better perhaps to play off that bon-vivant guy-among-guys smoothie-among-women persona he has established so comfortably. But he never gets that bounce. The dialogue drags no matter how fast Clooney and Zellweger rattle off their he-said-she-said lines in a studious imitation of Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell. Zellweger is a physical match for the showier spitfire hats in which shes framed but shes a personality mismatch for the role of a career-girl toughie who thrives on brainy banter with the boys. She seems stranded here a bruisable actor who has wandered as she sometimes does into the wrong role and the wrong era for her idiosyncratic talents. (Lexie in a railway sleeping car where the two are unwitting bunkmates ""So you want to play dirty?"" Dodge ""Maybe later Im a little tired right now."") Clooney in contrast just seems grimly determined -- to pretend to be jazzed by Zellwegers tense interpretation of banter to pretend to be having a grand time to get through the movie. Under the circumstances the collegial bond between Clooney and Krasinski is a relief from so much strained jocularity. Both exceptionally likable personalities both beholden to TV for their seasoning the natural ease between the pair hints at what Leatherheads could have been had Clooney the filmmaker not tried so hard to re-create a specialty genre rooted in so psychologically different an American time. And had Clooney the star not tried so unnecessarily hard to convince his already convinced fans that his fame and fortune are just the luck of the game.

In his third spin behind the camera George Clooney attempts one of the hardest things there is to do -- re-create the fizz of old Hollywood screwball comedies -- and creates just a mild buzz. ""Leatherheads"" a larky romp about the early days of professional football aims only to please and proves perfectly amiable but ultimate effect is one of much energy expended to minimal payoff. Arch and funny in equal measure this looks like a theatrical non-starter that Clooney fans and football devotees might be tempted to check out down the line on DVD or on the tube. Its always been hard to interest modern moviegoers in the early days of even the most popular sports -- ""A League of Their Own"" seems the well-liked anomaly in the field -- and Clooney goes about it here by giving a 20s story a 30s feel a la the madcap romantic comedies made by Howard Hawks George Cukor Frank Capra and others during the genres heyday. Establishing its throwback status by using a vintage Universal logo (just as ""The Sting"" did) and its jaunty attitude via period tunes the film focuses on a moment in 1925 when college football reigned and the so-called professional version was so derelict and disreputable it was threatened with extinction. Teams were made up of miners farmers high schoolers and men old enough to be the latters fathers brawlers who drank on the field and knew nothing of rules. Sometimes it seemed there were as many people on the field as there were in the stands. When the Duluth Bulldogs -- not the worst team around at the time -- are faced with bankruptcy their leading player Dodge Connolly (Clooney) hatches a scheme to recruit the nations most famous college player Princetons Carter ""The Bullet"" Rutherford (John Krasinski of TVs ""The Office"") to play for them. For 5000 per game Carters well-heeled agent (Jonathan Pryce) agrees further placated by Dodges platitudes about wanting to legitimize the game. Carter is a big deal not only for his speed and brawn but for his touted wartime heroics; like Sergeant York he is celebrated for having single-handedly induced many Germans to surrender. But one newspaper editor (Jack Thompson) thinks Carter is a fake and assigns sassy reporter Lexie Littleton (Renee Zellweger) to ""break the myth."" Clooney the other actors and the scripters former Sports Illustrated reporters Duncan Brantley and Rick Reilly clearly know the name of the game theyre playing; one feels their genuine desire for the film to look sound and feel right to recapture the spirit of the great old movies and to convey a certain moment when the sport changed from a freewheeling down-and-dirty game men played because they loved it to something that suddenly involved enough money for rules ethics and codes of conduct to be imposed. Many of the genre requisites are accounted for -- a colorful cast of characters rambunctious behavior glamorous clothes and settings and quick-witted repartee among good-looking people. Dodge and Lexie have initially opposing interests -- he needs Carters heroic image maintained for mercenary reasons while she means to destroy it -- and the verbal duels in their one-on-one scenes are actually pretty good. Maybe a bit too good however as their exchanges sound so finely polished that they stand distinct from the talk in the rest of the film. The romantic triangle also proceeds in fits and starts. Lexie and the tall manly Carter seem to quickly take to one another but as considerable time passes their relationship doesnt really develop while Dodge is obliged to watch from the sidelines even as he sneaks into Lexies sleeping car berth one night. Theres considerable joking about Lexie being too old for Carter and Dodge being too old for Lexie although it wouldnt seem that Clooney needs to hang up his romantic leading man spurs just yet. Other incongruities emerge World War I ended in 1918 so why is Carter only a junior at Princeton in 1925? And how is it that shortly after it looked as though pro football was about to go belly-up the game is being played at large stadiums in front of packed houses with the games broadcast on radio? Resolution of the Carter scandal and the climactic gridiron contest which resembles mud wrestling are smoothly handled although once again they feel like obligatory motions nicely executed rather than anything urgent or surpassingly entertaining. Physically ""Leatherheads"" is entirely inviting. Newton Thomas Sigel bathes the South Carolina locations in an attractively autumnal amber. Working in immaculate concert are Jim Bissells vivid production design and Louise Frogleys lively costumes; the opening scene at a Princeton-Penn game where everyone in the crowd is beautifully dressed in long coats and hats makes a striking impression. Randy Newmans score has genuine flavor and avoids cliches (tunesmith appears briefly as a speakeasy piano player). Led by their able player-coach Clooney the pleasure-inducing cast performs with uniform spirit and energy. Peter Gerety all but takes over the latter stretch of the picture as the newly installed football commissioner; his looks and glances of complicity warning and power-yielding are indelible.
