Im sold. Yes it gets a bit sentimental. Yes some Ya-Ya Sisterhood friendship cliches creep in. Yes it glosses history. But its also heartfelt hilarious and the cast is a dream-team topped by Viola Davis. Whats more it hinges on a gross-out scene that wouldnt look out of place in a John Waters film.Emma Stone plays a white college graduate Skeeter who persuades her best friends black maid Aibileen (Davis) to write about working for white families. Nowhere is the vile hypocrisy of separate but equal more apparent than in the maid-employer relationship. White employers wont even touch their maids yet these women are raising their kids drying tears and kissing scraped knees. Davis deserves the nominations that are surely coming her way; shes deeply moving as Aibileen who has brought up 17 white children and whose own son died in an accident. Octavia Spencer (pictured right) is hilarious as her best friend Minny - and there are good comic turns from Sissy Spacek and Jessica Chastain.This is the same era as Mad Men but Mississippi is a long way from New York. And Skeeters friends - the maids employers - make Betty Draper look like a radical feminist. The meanest of the mean girls is Hilly (Bryce Dallas Howard acidly amusing) who sacks a maid for using her toilet prompting that revoltingly funny gag.

Truth be told the Southern US States still hold a scary volume of racial tensions. The Help dwells on the petty everyday behavior of mistresses towards their maids. But its these accumulated insults that grind away at the maids dignity. The cast-iron law that maids cannot use the mansion house toilets whatever the urgency and must not be sassy. The practice that maids are passed onto to the next generation of daughters by their mothers confers a job for life but removes freedom of choice. These harsh iniquities are set within a glittering array of colonial mansions bridge afternoons chocolate pie and fabulous Cadillacs. A minor rebellion takes place amongst the maids fed by the newly graduated Skeeter Phelan she secures a NY journalists career launched on the back of the maids everyday gossipy revelations about their nasty employers - a book is successfully published ""The Help"" earning the contributers 40 each. This all ties up rather nicely as Skeeter gets her job and the maids lose theirs. A Womens Institutes view of inhumanity from a kitchen range vista but still an enjoyable two hours.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyNov 6 2011rodgey1FeaturedI was led to believe it was a film based on a true story so was a little skeptical. At the end it told me it was from a novel and strangly didnt mind the slight contrivances. Clearly based on the dreadful treatment my fellow whites have meted out over the years. So shame on us. But a very interesting way of telling the story. Highly enjoyable and moving at the same time and definite oscar worthy perforrmances all round. My only slight gripe is I found it difficult to catch all the dialogue.

Disturbing in a make you angry rather than violent or scary way. Stone is excellent and the two lead maids will make you laugh and make you cry. It is their story and it shows just how bad things were in the South of the USA not so long ago. Chastains character may not be visibly different to the Southern Belles yet she faces bigotry possibly even more disturbing than the maids. She may be rich and white but she is ostracised in possibly a more complete way than the maids. At least they get into the nice houses. As the ""uber bitch"" and Queen bee Dallas Howard is superb in a role that should win her many awards. However I expect to see her and Stone getting lots of nominations whilst Davis takes home the awards.

By Joe Morgenstern August 12 2011 Viola Davis has a way with words that cuts to the quick and pierces the heart. The moment she says ""Lookin after white kids is what I do"" you want to learn more about the woman she plays a Negro maid named Aibileen who works for a white family in 1960s Mississippi. Learning more is what drives Tate Taylors screen version of Kathryn Stocketts debut novel. In an era when Jim Crow laws keep the races apart a young white woman Skeeter (Emma Stone) dares to interview Aibileen and other maids in town to learn who they are and how they live. In our day when knowledge of the past is spotty the film may well teach audiences while moving them to tears with its inspirational tale of color-blind sisterhood and courage in the face of bigotry. Instead of plunging us into a racist past however ""The Help"" takes us on a pop-cultural tour that savors the picturesque and strengthens stereotypes it purports to shatter. ENLARGE Octavia Spencer Viola Davis and Emma Stone in The Help. DreamWorks Theres nothing picturesque about Ms. Daviss performance; warmth comes effortlessly to this wonderful actress along with quiet candor that translates to revealed truth. Aibileen hasnt had the time or money to look after her own children and her life story is all the more heartbreaking for the calm tones in which she recounts it. Aibileens best friend and fellow maid Minny is played by Octavia Spencer another terrific actress with a contrasting style and a problem thats not of her making. At times she makes Minny a formidable force ""I need to see you square on at all times"" Minny tells Skeeter who understands instantly that she means business. But Ms. Spencers greatest strength is exuberant comedy which serves the movie extremely well except when the dubious dialect spoken exclusively by blacks in the book takes Minny to the edge of self-parody and Mr. Taylors broad-stroke direction pushes her over. ""Fryin chicken jus tend to make you feel better about life"" made me feel worse about life by recalling bumptious black mammies of movies past. ""The Help"" is bound to be a hit. Just as readers loved the book for good reason--its resonant themes transcended its imperfect craftsmanship--audiences starved for substance after a long dry summer will embrace the movie. Theyll do so not only for the white guilt it addresses and deftly mitigates but for the plots entertaining contrivances (chief among them a climax of cyclonic uplift) the bonds of love between whites and blacks and a cast of outsize characters that includes Bryce Dallas Howards chillingly bigoted Hilly smiling incessantly and focused on preserving white purity with ever more black-only toilets; and Jessica Chastains desperate white-trashy Celia. Sissy Spaceks Missus Walters isnt outsize shes just-right-size. Droll in her dottiness the old dame is devoid of illusions about the hypocrisy that surrounds her. Much has been made of the author Ms. Stockett having given her books screen rights to Mr. Taylor a friend from childhood and having supported his determination to write and direct the film even though he had done only one feature before. This speaks well for their friendship but the directors inexperience shows when Aibileen and Minny arent on screen (and sometimes when they are Minnys gleeful revenge plot seems awfully silly). Skeeters mother played by Allison Janney is a drab construction with an oddly unsatisfying story to tell. Skeeters boyfriend is an inconstant cipher and her book editor in New York is a fleeting caricature of a Jewish liberal while the caricatures of Hillys Junior League cohorts are as vivid as they are unrestrained. As for Ms. Stones Skeeter shes the pivotal figure in a coming-of-age story with darkly dramatic overtones; by enlisting the towns maids in her forbidden literary venture shes exposing them as well as herself to great danger. And shes played by a young actress who has become in what seems to have been no time flat one of the most interesting quick-witted stars in contemporary films. Disappointingly though Skeeter remains a device albeit an attractive one an earnest learner taking notes with her pencil and pad while ""The Help"" gets indispensable help from sassy Minny and soulful Aibileen. Senna Formula 1 cars are ferociously fast and weirdly beautiful with wings that keep them on the ground instead of lifting them to the sky. ""Senna"" in limited release this week feasts its cameras on whole fleets of these machines as they roar by; this thrilling documentary by Asif Kapadia recounts the career of the late Ayrton Senna a driver of legendary skill and courage and a national hero in his native Brazil. Yet the film opens almost quaintly with what looks to be a Super 8 home-movie sequence of a very young Mr. Senna in his first race abroad steering a squat little go-kart around a European track. ""It was pure driving pure racing"" we hear him recall elegiacally. ""There wasnt any politics no money involved either. It was real racing."" That sets the tone perfectly for whats to come a celebration of a singular spirit in an impure sport. ENLARGE Ayrton Senna celebrates a victory in Senna. What were told about Mr. Senna the driver--he died in a crash in 1994--is clearly validated by his record. With his vaulting ambition keen intellect and uncanny skill he could push cars to do things they werent designed for. In one race his engine stalls at the start. Restarting it he works his way up from the back of the pack to win. He wins another race despite a jammed gearbox that leaves him stuck in sixth gear. Wet tracks that plague other drivers are his preferred habitat. (Someone calls him ""a genius in the rain."") The movie is less clear about the political forces arrayed against him. What are the specifics behind the implication that the French head of Formula 1 racing favored Alain Prost the shrewdly calculating French driver who began as Mr. Sennas friendly rival and became his despised nemesis? How just or unjust was the not-so-veiled accusation of recklessness leveled at Mr. Senna by Jackie Stewart the Formula 1 champion turned TV commentator? The director and his writer Manish Pandey value action over words. Though others discuss Mr. Senna on the soundtrack the film never cuts away to talking heads for the sort of explanatory interviews weve come to expect in conventional documentaries. Thats admirable in principle and the high-speed race sequences are enthralling--grittier and therefore more graphic than the footage from top-of-the-line cameras in fiction films. (Watch the on-board videos on a big screen and you start to understand how preposterously high the speeds are.) Still additional context would have been welcome. I especially wished that stylistic principles could have been suspended long enough for a sitdown with the briefly eloquent Professor Sid Watkins a retired neurosurgeon and former Formula 1 track doctor who became Mr. Sennas close friend. Whats most rewarding though is that Mr. Senna speaks extensively and eloquently for himself and reveals himself to be an eminently human hero. Hes thoughtful even philosophical about decisions that deprive him of seemingly well-earned victories. He goes out on the track to see a fellow driver who lies injured after an accident--not only out of empathy though surely that but out of a need to confront the ever-present perils of his trade. His rival Mr. Prost sneers that Mr. Sennas faith in God makes him think hes immortal but the opposite is the case ""Im as scared as anyone of getting hurt"" Mr. Senna says and you believe it just as you believe the essential truthfulness of everything this hugely likable man says. The peril that took his life came from an unforeseen source. A triple champion at the age of 31 he suddenly found himself competing against invincible technology--a rival car that balanced itself with computerized stabilizers at each of its four wheels. By switching teams Mr. Senna eventually got himself into a car equipped with such devices but then all of the newfangled stabilizers were banned leaving him with an unbalanced machine he didnt like because it didnt respond properly to his touch. A sense of fatefulness grows almost unbearable toward the end but the film takes a final breathtaking turn into a realm of abstract beauty that was glimpsed in the beginning and ""Senna"" reminds us one more time what it was that drove the driver. DVD FOCUS ENLARGE From left To Kill a Mockingbird Easy A and Grand Prix To Kill a Mockingbird (1962) Just in case youve forgotten what the fuss was all about or havent had your ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" fix from TV lately. Robert Mulligan directed this justly celebrated film from Horton Footes adaptation of the Harper Lee novel. In a long and distinguished career Gregory Peck was never more stirring than he was in his Oscar-winning performance as Atticus Finch the lawyer in the Depression-era South who defends a black man Brock Peterss Tom Robinson against a rape charge. Elmer Bernstein composed the music. Russell Harlan was the cinematographer. Easy A (2010) Just in case you missed the movie--and you probably did--that made Emma Stone a star. This high-school comedy directed by Will Gluck from an elated and elating screenply by Bert V. Royal didnt get the respect or success it deserved. Ms. Stone plays Olive Penderghast an Ojai Calif. high-school student who goes to class in a bustier emblazoned with the scarlet A of an adulteress. How she reaches this point is a convoluted story and a hilarious one. Suffice it to say that Olive identifies intensely with Hester Prynne the outcast heroine of ""The Scarlet Letter."" Grand Prix (1966) Formula 1 in all its glory. Nothing before or since can match the spectacle of John Frankenheimers race-car epic which was shot in 65mm and was rereleased only three months ago in the appropriate glory of Blu-ray. In one of the minidocumentaries that constitute the discs special features Saul Bass talks about how he designed the multiple screens and helped the director differentiate one race from another. The cast includes James Garner Eva Marie Saint Yves Montand Toshiro Mifune and Brian Bedford. The director of cinematography was Lionel Lindon who shot Mr. Frankenheimers classic ""The Manchurian Candidate.""

So forgive us if we find the comedic emphasis on the ""scandalous"" payback in the big-screen adaptation of Kathryn Stocketts ""The Help"" more Pyrrhic than satisfying. Dont get us wrong The revenge that comes in this tale of black housekeepers and white families set in 1962 is richly deserved -- and deliciously served. But it feels a little bit beside the point. The same holds true for writer-director Tate Taylors take on Stocketts best seller. In its rush to please this adaptation bleeds too much of the pain out of the interwoven stories of its heroes good friends and housekeepers Aibileen Clark and Minny Jackson and Skeeter Phelan an aspiring writer who gets the women to share their tales of indignities and injustices. Thanks to a talented cast -- starting with leads Emma Stone Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer -- the movie is often entertaining. But ""The Help"" should have been challenging too -- possibly even enduring. What this song of the South needed to be was a little more of a dirge. Villainy comes in the prissy form of Hilly Holbrook. As portrayed by Bryce Dallas Howard shes a mean girl before there was a name for them. Sissy Spacek has cantankerous fun as Hillys mother Missus Walters whose maid Minny (Spencer) is canned for allegedly stealing silver. The hostess to whom all other Jackson Miss. society gals kowtow shes obsessed with getting an ordinance on the books that will require white employers to install a separate toilet for their unequal black help. If Hilly is a harbinger of the modern mean girl Aibileen could be a forerunner to Oprah. She is a dispenser of wisdom and affirmation for her tiny ward Mae Mobley Leefolt daughter of the neglectful and nervous Elizabeth (Ahna OReilly). Davis relies on quietude a genuine gift to signal the grief of a mother who lost her son but still manages to dip into a well of compassion for other peoples children. Stockett chose 1962 as her storys setting for good reason. It was a tipping point for Mississippians. That October James Meredith enrolled at the University of Mississippi. Eight months later Medgar Evers was shot in front of the Jackson home he shared with his wife and their three children. Taylor slips some of these facts into his film. But had he found ways to inject it with that milieu ""The Help"" might have nailed the novels surprisingly subtle achievements. Even so the movies unlikely triumvirate triumphs thanks to the on-screen presence of Davis Spencer and Stone. Spencer nearly steals the show because Minny is the type of character that so often does. Shes tart-mouthed and adept at the comedic double take. And add Jessica Chastain as Celia Foote to the list of reasons to see ""The Help."" She brings an appealing guilelessness to the scattered mistress of a shambling plantation house who employs blacklisted Minny to clean house and give her cooking lessons without her husbands knowledge. But make no mistake Celia is yet another white child being brought up by a black woman.

Comments (3) click to enlarge The Help Rated PG-13  137 minutes  2011 This DreamWorks production a sort of primer on racism for grade-school children presents the segregation era with little sociological nuance but plenty of bathroom humor. Rolling her eyes like a community theater diva Emma Stone plays an aspiring journalist who defies her upper-class background to conduct a series of secret interviews with black domestics in Mississippi in the early 60s. As in many reductive period pieces there are no real characters here just archetypes namely reactionary cretins and sensitive souls who anticipate modern attitudes. (Theres a third type of course the angelic quietly suffering black matriarch.) This is at least handsome to look at thanks to a digitally enhanced color scheme modeled after the Coens O Brother Where Art Thou? though the storybook aesthetic is completely inappropriate to the theme of injustice.

The Help reviewed A feel-good movie that feels kind of icky. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Aug. 11 2011 1116 AM The Help A feel-good movie that feels kind of icky. By Dana Stevens Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer in The Help ""This isnt about me"" aspiring journalist Skeeter Phelan (Emma Stone) assures housemaid Aibileen Clark (Viola Davis) as they sit tensely together in Aibileens kitchen in early 1960s Jackson Miss. By ""this"" Skeeter means the book shes hoping to compile from the testimonials of black housemaids--a book titled like this movie and the Oprah-endorsed best-seller its based on The Help (Dreamworks/Disney). Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Skeeter--a brainy ambitious white woman freshly graduated from Ole Miss--eventually convinces the skeptical Aibileen of her good faith and together they produce an oral history scandalous enough to turn Jacksons Junior League on its ear. But its never clear whether we the audience should believe Skeeters disclaimer or not since the movie sort of is about her. The Help written and directed by Tate Taylor from the novel by Kathryn Stockett belongs to the Driving Miss Daisy tradition of feel-good fables about black-white relations in America movies in which institutional racism takes a backseat to the personal enlightenment of one white character. Advertisement Its hard to actively hate The Help a movie so solicitous of the audiences favor that it cant help but win it some of the time. Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer are tremendous as the stolid Aibileen and her hot-tempered best friend and fellow housekeeper Minny; these two women are funny smart and righteous and every moment we spend in their company is a delight. Some of the smaller performances are quite fine too especially Jessica Chastain as a ditzy new arrival in town. There are several solid laughs and at least two instances when I had to scramble for a tissue. But after awhile all this emotional dexterity starts to resemble emotional manipulation. The Help is a high-functioning tearjerker but the catharsis it offers feels glib and insufficient a Barbie Band-Aid on the still-raw wound of race relations in America. Skeeters idea for the book begins to take shape when Minnys employer the bitchy queen bee Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard) starts a campaign to pass a bill requiring separate ""colored"" bathrooms for houses with domestic help. When Minny defiantly uses her bosss bathroom Hilly summarily fires her and Minny after taking sly revenge goes to work for Celia Foote (Chastain) a nouveau-riche newlywed whom Hilly has chosen as her sworn enemy. While the white women of Jackson spar over social status bridge clubs and charity fundraisers the towns black maids who are bused in each morning from the poorer side of town struggle to make a living and send their children to school. A few characters like Skeeters ailing mother (Allison Janney) are given a trajectory from racial obliviousness to semi-enlightenment but for the most part whites in this movie are either pure-of-heart crusaders or sneering bigots. Similarly some of the black characters (most notably Skeeters aged former nanny Constantine played by a frail-looking Cicely Tyson) border on saintly stereotypes from a sentimental abolitionist-era novel. This moral Manichaeism makes for satisfying melodrama--in fact one of the two scenes that made me cry involved the angelic Constantine. But it also lets the viewer off the hook by making racism seem like a quaint artifact of the days when there were openly racist Hillys bullying self-evidently blameless Constantines. If The Help contained more moments in which Skeeters good will wasnt enough--in which despite her best intentions she blundered by unintentionally patronizing one of her interview subjects and had to confront her own received ideas about race--contemporary viewers might recognize a moment weve actually lived through rather than being encouraged to congratulate ourselves on how far weve come. Then again if glossily inspiring movies about African-American lives didnt get made would a different more challenging kind get made in their place? Part of me wants to say that its fine for The Help book and movie to exist as a pop-cultural phenomenon. The story simplifies and reduces the civil rights movement yes but at least its about it.Thats not nothing given the insulated bubble in which most movies marketed at women take place (the blithely apolitical Eat Pray Love comes to mind). The Help raises the eternal question faced by minority groups who have to fight for space onscreen (that is to say anyone but white men) Do we count ourselves glad to make any inroads we can or do we demand rich nuanced subtle representations right from the start? I get the feeling that The Helps reception will be sharply divided by that question--a division which may in itself be this movies most valuable contribution.

By David Denby Octavia Spencer Viola Davis and Emma Stone in a film of the best-selling book.   Credit Illustration by ROBERT RISKO ""The Help"" based on Kathryn Stocketts best-selling 2009 novel is in some ways crude and obvious but it opens up a broad new swath of experience on the screen and parts of it are so moving and well acted that any objections to whats second-rate seem to matter less as the movie goes on. This is the kind of heartfelt liberal picture that Robert Mulligan (""To Kill a Mockingbird"") or Martin Ritt (""Sounder"") would have made forty or fifty years ago but with a different subject--what black women working for wealthy white families in Mississippi in the early nineteen-sixties (and by extension at any time and place) felt about their lives and about their female employers. The maids raised many of the white women but the love they once felt for one another has been destroyed by chagrin and dishonesties. The women are now having their own children and they too have maids to do the messy chores of rearing them. Sometimes the maids are the same ones who brought up the women but now the women regard them not as family but as lowly hired help. Its 1962 in Jackson where the civil-rights movement is gaining strength and whites are frightened and incensed. The young women idle and snobbish harden into condescending racists refusing for instance to allow the maids to use the toilets in their houses. A peculiarly intimate bitterness a sense of betrayal heats up the material the women suppress their childhood memories and the maids cant speak freely. They cant air their sufferings over their own children and men; they cant say much of anything if they want to stay employed. Stockett shrewdly popularized her subject for her audience. ""The Help"" is morally serious and touching but it has a goosey gossipy quality and a heavy dose of villainy leading to an unpersuasive outcome. The novel appears to be an act of both penance and self-congratulation. Stockett herself grew up in Jackson in the nineteen-seventies and eighties and was raised mainly by her familys black maid Demetrie McLorn who died when Stockett was sixteen. Stockett has re-created the lives of women like McLorn but she set the material during the civil-rights movement and she put a privileged white woman at the center of the narrative. Skeeter (Emma Stone in the movie) graduates from Ole Miss and like her friends she is expected to get married but shes restlessly ambitious and wants to write. Quietly outraged by the cruelty of her social set Skeeter interviews the black maids she knows. There are three first-person narrators in the book Skeeter; the wounded and loving Aibileen (Viola Davis) a maid who has raised seventeen white kids; and a maid named Minny (Octavia Spencer) who is irrepressibly outspoken and frequently canned. In both the book and the movie Skeeter does what Stockett did she writes a best-selling novel called ""The Help."" In brief Stockett memorialized her own book as she wrote it composing a myth of literary creation with a version of herself as heroine. The result is a little embarrassing what Stockett did in safety in 2009 feels like a projection of what she would have liked to have done in a more heroic time. I wouldnt quarrel (as some people have) with a white womans choice to write in the voices of black women or to say what black women of fifty years ago felt. A writer should be able to write in any voice she likes and invented feelings may have a power and an authenticity that transcend literal accuracy. The only issue is whether the results are any good. To my ears the voices in the book are sustained and affecting and Stockett has strived to accurately capture Southern black speech in some of her promotional readings in bookstores she was accompanied by her friend the actress Octavia Spencer and Spencer read the parts written in Minny and Aibileens voices. Those readings it turned out were a kind of halfway point between the text and the movie onscreen Spencer and Viola Davis both great actresses have given Stocketts words the shape the rhythm and the pitch of their own temperaments. They sound right. ""The Help"" was adapted and directed by another friend of Stocketts Tate Taylor who is also an actor and obviously loves actresses; he brings out the best in his large cast of women. Viola Davis possesses phenomenal concentration. When she fixes her eyes on another woman she seems to see right into her soul and the effect is unnerving. As Aibileen tells her story to Skeeter Davis speaks slowly and effortfully--each word is weighted with feeling. Octavia Spencer has a baleful eye and wicked timing; she turns her defiant scorn into expertly delivered riffs. Its deliciously satisfying to see her play a woman who wont hold her tongue. You remember the degradations endured by Hattie McDaniel Butterfly McQueen and Louise Beavers who played maids and mammies in the nineteen-thirties and forties and were allowed to suggest no more than a fraction of what they could do. Emma Stones Skeeter is recognizable as a member of an upper-class social set bred for early marriage. She loves her wayward conservative mother (Allison Janney) who wants her to settle down with a tall wealthy young man--any tall wealthy young man. Skeeter doesnt achieve independence overnight but she has a quality of taut self-definition an air of determined curiosity. Skeeters girlfriends including the witchy Hilly (Bryce Dallas Howard) show up at Junior League luncheons wearing silk flower-print dresses their hair in beehives and bouffant flips garnished with barrettes; they must walk around in rollers most of the time prepping for these events. They squeal and jump when they see one another and then smile as they close ranks against the black women who raised them. Propped up by racist pseudo-science they think that theyre doing their Christian duty for their children by throwing the maids out of the house bathrooms. From the beginning Stones looks set her apart as much as her manner does. She has long auburn tresses that fly gloriously in every direction each tendril seemingly guided by will and she dresses in solid grays and browns and wears glasses. Stone makes it clear that Skeeters break with her friends is produced as much by ambition for a hot literary subject as by moral disapproval. She is one of the few actresses playing a working writer who have actually seemed like one. The husbands off at their jobs most of the time perform only a peripheral role and Skeeter has a rather baffling boyfriend (Chris Lowell) who behaves first like a lout then like a prince then like a lout again. Taylor doesnt seem much interested in him; hes just a guy and not quite real. Female friendship is at the heart of the movie. As Skeeter moves away from the Junior League she becomes closer to the black women in town a risky situation for all of them it was dangerous in Mississippi for whites and blacks even to talk about racial oppression. As they open up to one another talking with greater candor protest marches and violence are on the rise. Taylor has a story to tell and he doesnt let us see much of the political activity but we feel its pressure in the anxiety of the black women and the tight-lipped anger of the whites. Stockett in one of her many smart moves insisted that the film be made in her home state (it was shot mostly in Greenwood) and a good part of the movies emotional strength comes from the physical details the lush green fields; the bright fully saturated colors (Stephen Goldblatt did the cinematography); the whiter-than-white mansions of the rich; the drab crumbling shacks of the maids who are bused into the genteel sections of Jackson every morning. The behavior of the young white women is vile but the story lapses into a viciousness of its own. Hilly isnt only a bitch shes an idiot and the movie takes her down again and again culminating in a baroquely obscene comic insult. Yet this broad attack is likely to make the movie a hit--happy laughter echoed through the theatre when I saw the picture. (Revenge is sweet.) ""The Help"" is insensitive in another way too. The socialites have no use for Celia (Jessica Chastain the mother in ""The Tree of Life"") a white-trash bombshell married to a wealthy young man whos a decent fellow. Kindhearted and instinctively non-racist Celia finds an ally in Minny whom she hires and who teaches her to cook fried chicken and grits. Even the best of the husbands we see dont want their wives to do anything more than produce children and a good table. In one way Celia is in the same boat as the socialites. Stockett and Taylor set those awful women up for humiliation but dont seem to realize that they are victims too.  David Denby has been a staff writer and film critic at The New Yorker since 1998.

Photo Credit Dale Robinette/DreamWorks Pictures/Dale Robinette advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT In 1963 a group of women tests the color barrier in the Deep South. BOTTOM LINE A message movie thats fun and funny thanks to a winning cast and an irreverent sense of humor. CAST Emma Stone Viola Davis Bryce Dallas Howard WHEN/WHERE Area theaters LENGTH 217 An inspirational all-female drama ""The Help"" is an unlikely place to discover one of the best screen villains in years. She is Hilly Holbrook a chatty chirpy racist played to perfection by Bryce Dallas Howard with a mix of Southern charm and ice-cold sadism. Set in Jackson Miss. on the cusp of the civil rights movement the movie doesnt need to show attack dogs and fire hoses; Hillys half-lowered eyelashes are evil enough. ""The Help"" brings a chick-flick sensibility to a serious subject which is more daring than it might sound. Its also incredibly refreshing. Based on Kathryn Stocketts 2009 novel ""The Help"" focuses on the domestic front where men rarely trod which means the bigots here arent the usual tobacco-spitters and shotgun- toters. Instead they wear A-line dresses heels and nasty smiles. advertisement | advertise on newsday Our heroine is Eugenia ""Skeeter"" Phelan (a winning Emma Stone) a fledgling reporter at the Jackson Journal. Charged with writing the housekeeping column Skeeter decides to interview actual housekeepers the towns black maids. Aibileen (Viola Davis dependably solid) is the first who dares to tell her story a big risk in such a small town. Others angered by Hillys semipsychotic campaign to install ""colored"" toilets in white homes follow suit. (The film has one running potty joke too good to spoil here that becomes a surprisingly effective symbol of white hypocrisy.) Like the novel the movie deserves criticism for its somewhat saintly black characters. But it is sensitively directed by Tate Taylor (like Stockett a Jackson native) and filled with terrific performances. Octavia Spencer and Jessica Chastain are engaging as a maid and her employer both outcasts; Cicely Tyson Allison Janney and Sissy Spacek are mother figures who range from heartbreaking to hilarious. Mary Steenburgen plays a New York publisher who wants Skeeter to write fast before this whole civil rights thing ""blows over."" Is the movie-making light of an era filled with suffering and sacrifice? If anything it succeeds precisely because it never overdoes the hand-wringing. ""The Help"" is one thing message movies rarely are Its fun.

Elizabeth Weitzman Wednesday August 10 2011 400 AM Title The Help With Emma Stone Viola Davis. Racism divides the women of 1962 Mississippi.  Director Tate Taylor (217). PG-13 Mature themes. At area theaters. In her best-selling novel ""The Help"" Kathryn Stockett didnt simply introduce us to a few memorable individuals. She offered a meticulously etched portrait of a specific way of life. Tate Taylors eagerly anticipated adaptation is impactful in parts but noticeably lacking in Stocketts instinctive nuance. Though he grew up there himself Taylors Jackson Miss. could be any suburban Southern neighborhood in the early 60s. Similarly many of his actresses have little apparent connection to the intricate culture they are meant to portray. Emma Stone for example is no ones idea of an ugly duckling. And though she offers a sincere effort she never quite settles into the role of Skeeter an aspiring author whose plain looks and spinster status -- at age 23 -- horrify her beauty-queen mother (Allison Janney also miscast). While her small-minded friends gossip through Junior League meetings she envisions her first book idea to give voice to the African-American housekeepers ritually abused by the employers who need them. In 1962 when blacks and whites are divided by both prejudice and the law Skeeters plan is dangerous for everyone involved. But having been pushed to the limit both Aibileen (Viola Davis) and Minny (Octavia Spencer) agree to share their experiences. All the while they have to hide the project from their bosses viciously racist Hilly (Bryce Dallas Howard) ignorant Elizabeth (Ahna OReilly) and flighty Celia (Jessica Chastain). While the books minor -- but crucial -- details are often overlooked the major themes are thrust on screen with forceful simplicity as if Taylor doesnt trust us to understand the stakes. Despite his unsubtle script Davis and Spencer are experienced and assured enough to give their characters considerable depth and their stirring portrayals make the film worth watching. Their younger castmates unfortunately needed more guidance than they evidently received. How much more powerful Hillys shameful cruelty and Skeeters tentative rebellion would have been if they felt intimate and complex rather than grandly symbolic. Stocketts Jackson was a suffocating hothouse where tendrils of ugliness grew amid women raised to be nothing more than beautiful. She illuminated both sin and valor by exposing -- for better and worse -- the humanity in all her characters. In contrast Taylors characters are familiar because weve seen them in movies so many times before heroes and villains drawn in broad strokes residents of a world regrettably lacking shades of gray.

"The Help (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Help (PG-13) Kathryn Stocketts bestselling novel gets a film adaptation worthy of its pedigree. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle The Miami Herald8/10/2011 Editor rating 3 Director Tate Taylors engaging adaptation of Kathryn Stocketts bestselling novel arrives at a strange time of year; movies with such hefty pedigrees usually show up in the fall. But its release in the waning days of summer is a bracing reminder that theres more to entertainment than superheroes hyper intelligent apes and beloved teen wizards. Unique and sensitive in its treatment of a potentially tricky subject The Help is a moving superbly cast examination of a point of view that has been largely neglected that of black domestic workers in the South during the most turbulent days of the civil rights era. The trailers may leave the impression that The Help is more comedy than drama and the film can be pointedly funny. But Taylor a close friend of Stocketts who also adapted the screenplay never loses sight of the sharp edge of casual pervasive racism and how it poisons the lives of everyone -- black and white -- in early 1960s Jackson Miss. Three women lie at the films center quiet Aibileen (the great Viola Davis a sure bet for an Oscar nomination) who loves her employers small daughter Mae Mobley as if the child were her own; her best friend Minny (the equally terrific Octavia Spencer) the best cook in Jackson who has run afoul of her bossy deceitful employer Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard the broadly comic villain of the piece) because she cant censor her sharp tongue; and Eugenia ""Skeeter"" Phelan (Emma Stone in a heartfelt performance) a socially awkward college graduate with dreams of becoming a writer much to the dismay of her traditionally minded mother (Allison Janney). When Skeeter decides to write a book compiling accounts of daily life from the towns maids she first meets with resistance from her subjects; what black woman would dare to tell tales about her white boss? But gradually Aibileen realizes she cant stay silent. Humiliated by her boss insistence on building a separate bathroom for her in the garage -- ""They have different diseases"" Hilly opines loudly and repeatedly -- she understands that some risks are worth taking. The dangers Aibileen -- and before long Minny -- face once they begin to work with Skeeter are somewhat watered down in the film. You never feel Taylor will let anything too terrible happen to these characters. Following Stocketts blueprint the director relegates men to the sidelines. Scenes between Skeeter and a would-be suitor turn out to be the least interesting plotline in the film. The Help is most interested in its women including Jessica Chastain as Celia a former white-trash girl who married up. Shunned by Hilly and her friends Celia hires Minny because shes such an outcast she hasnt heard the rumors about Minnys bad behavior (and boy is it ever bad). Within the confines of the times a sort of friendship blossoms between the two outcasts. Taylor painstakingly recreates Stocketts social pecking order illustrating that small town Southern society had a way of punishing all who refuse to comply with its rules. There are moments of heartbreaking clarity Minny explaining to her daughter before her first day of work that she must taste food with a different spoon than she cooks with; Aibileen whispering platitudes (""You are good; you are smart; you are kind"") to the neglected Mae Mobley a child she will inevitably lose. The Help will make you laugh yes but it can also break your heart. In the dog days of August moviegoing thats a powerful recommendation.

My view of this controversy is easily stated I have no idea whoas right. The novel set in Jackson Mississippi in the early sixties is predictable heavy-handed and rich in cringe-worthy Southern-Negraa dialect. But itas also rich in evocative detail in close observation of servants and employers and the distinctive coping mechanisms of each class. From a dramatic standpoint the most compelling vantage might well be that of the young white woman aSkeetera Phelan presumably Stockettas alter ego. Sheas wracked with guilt over having essentially been raised by a black woman too poor to stay home with her own children. If The Help exploits black experience it does so partly out of a need for penance. The film faithfully adapted and directed by Stocketts childhood friend Tate Taylor (also an actor) has too glowing a palette and too many TV-style close-ups. But its an unusually thorough emotional workout Get past one hurdle without blubbering and the next will bring you down. It plays like gangbusters on the level of soap opera -- of what my familys housekeeper used to call her ""story"" which she watched avidly while ironing. Of course if her ""story"" had featured black women paid poorly to iron white peoples clothes all our lives might have turned out differently. Emma Stone an actress whose mind works so fast that she can be at once blurty and brainy plays the 23-year-old Skeeter an aspiring writer who returns from college to find her wealthy familys cherished maid gone under mysterious circumstances and her friends married with kids and black maids of their own. As racial tensions intensify (Medgar Evers is murdered other blacks are lynched) and the snooty debutantes reveal their true segregationist selves Skeeter prevails on her friend Elizabeths maid Aibilene (Viola Davis) to tell her story in a book to be called appropriately enough The Help. Its a potentially deadly enterprise in this time and place even if the book will be credited to ""anonymous"" with names and settings changed. And when Skeeters New York-Jewish editor (Mary Steenburgen) insists that there be many black women represented the whole community of domestics must weigh the risks to themselves and their families. Thank heaven for Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard) whos just the kind of stock white Southern villainess who can drive even the most reticent of servants to pick up pen and paper. Howard slits her eyes and peers suspiciously at every vaguely human transaction between maid and employer These people must always know their place In her first scene she announces that its unhygienic to let blacks use the toilets in white houses and directs her friends to build outhouses. Then Hilly dumps her aging mothers maid Minny (Octavia Spencer) for being whats often called ""sassy"" with trumped-up charges of theft thrown in for good measure. Finally she refuses to loan Minnys replacement a mere 75 dollars for the maids sons college tuition on the bizarre grounds that a good Christian has the strength of character to spurn offers of charity. Although white males were known to make sexual overtures to the help and white children to bedevil them in The Help its only the women -- the belles of the balls -- who misuse their power and make life for their maids an endless series of insults. The Help could have ended up a misogynist cartoon but these actresses find every possible nuance -- even Howard shows you the neurotic fear of losing control that holds Hillys racism in place. Jessica Chastain plays a handsome rich guys hot uneducated wife who hires Minny on the sly to teach her how to clean and cook and although the character has been simplified -- in the novel shes scarily unstable -- Chastain makes her helplessness hilarious. Sissy Spacek has some crowd-pleasing bits as Hillys mom derisive toward her daughter even in her dottiness while Allison Janney turns Skeeters often-oblivious mother into a study of obliviousness as it teeters on the brink of awareness. And while Octavia Spencer doesnt rise above her ""sassy"" stereotype she brings a good theatrical charge to every scene. But The Help belongs to Viola Davis. Some of Stocketts critics have gone so far as to say she romanticizes domestic servitude by depicting black nannies genuine love for the white children in their care -- as if Stockett were deluding herself into thinking she was more than just an unpleasant job for her familys maid. But Davis makes Aibilenes love for her employers neglected daughter overwhelmingly credible. She has eyes unlike other actresss hard unyielding with no give back. They only soften for this pudgy needy little girl -- and only then because they see in the child something frighteningly vulnerable that reminds her of her own child and of all the children whose value goes unrecognized. Its a tough beautifully judged performance -- it gives this too-soft movie a spine.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Wednesday Aug. 10 2011 1201AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 240PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Before the funny movie came the somewhat more serious book whose white author dared to write in a black voice. Lets start with the book. A segregated society especially one with a slave history like the American South is both tragically unjust and terribly complicated. Complicated because master-slave relationships demand inequality even as they promote interdependence leaving both sides to sift through a welter of emotions - fear hatred anger and guilt obviously but loyalty too even love. Intelligent Southerners black and white have always been sensitive to those complexities. Intelligent Southerners who happen to be gifted writers black and white have woven them into the fabric of their work. To do so with full honesty they must use their own voice and appropriate others. The question is not whether voice appropriation is morally right - without it neither William Faulkner nor Alice Walker could have written what they did - but whether its socially and aesthetically truthful. Multimedia The Help the official trailer video Video Howard discusses her racist character in The Help Kathryn Stockett is a white Mississippian with a bestselling novel to her credit. Now few would put The Help on the proud shelf of great Southern literature; on its evidence Stockett is hardly a gifted writer. But her intentions are good To revisit Mississippi in the early sixties using the relationship between black maids the white children they raise and the women who employ them as a matrix for examining segregations complex emotions. Yes she appropriates black voices not credibly but clumsily and sentimentally although always in the service of her liberal-minded theme. The book reads like Civil Rights Lite. Now comes the inevitable movie which in the hands of writer/director Tate Taylor does a novel about injustice an injustice itself It turns lite into featherweight. The tag line to the movie poster claims ""Change begins with a whisper"" but the advertising proves false. Seems that change begins with a laugh and pretty much stays there. Yet credit Taylor with novelty. Typically this sort of film is an earnest tear-jerker with moments of levity. Instead what we have here is a raucous rib-tickler with occasional pauses for a little dramatic relief. Fans of the book may not remember it as a comedy but the box office will likely crack a wide smile. Aibileen (Viola Davis) and Minny (Octavia Spencer) are the maids in question. Wise and dignified the former has raised ""white babies"" all her working life the latest a cute toddler whose own mother is as detached as she is ineffectual. Larger and fiery Minny toils for the villain of the piece - Miss Hilly (Bryce Dallas Howard) an acculturated racist blind to her own bigotry. Enter Skeeter (Emma Stone) a white woman back from college who unlike her girlfriends lacks a husband but is filled with liberal sentiments and writerly aspirations. To that end she invites the maids to transgress the Jim Crow laws and ""tell their stories"" to her which after some initial reluctance they do. Since those stories arent ""voiced"" in the film (as they are in the novel) the premise pretty much doubles as the whole plot. In the absence of narrative cue the comedy which arrives thick and fast and from the most unlikely sources. Hillys mother who suffers from dementia is a constant fount of laughs. So is Skeeters mom who suffers from cancer but my how shes determined to find that gal of hers a good man. The villainous Hilly herself is more the object of our laughter - like when a crap-load of commodes are piled on her front lawn or in the same scatological spirit when Minny gets her revenge by baking the bigot a chocolate pie with a very personal additive. Over in the mansion of the buxom Celia (Jessica Chastain) the white-trash blonde who married up but retained her heart of gold the romp continues - she attends the charity ball imbibes too much pukes on the hoity-toities. Curiously in the midst of the mania its Stone hitherto a comic actor whos left with the unenviable task of essentially playing the straight woman. She does look a bit miscast. But not Davis whose monologues - for example recounting the death of Aibileens son - give the script a depth it otherwise lacks Yet her contributions also seem oddly out of place as if she just stepped in from the set of Mississippi Burning. Meanwhile the real struggle for change the one that began not with a whisper but with shouts and shootings and the deaths of martyrs like Medgar Evers - is politely confined to a glimpse or two at the edges of the frame. So the fun continues through to the climax when something even weirder happens. This is one of the very few movies Ive seen where the sad ending feels gratuitously tacked on and completely unearned. Yet say this for The Help. At a running time well over two hours the film realistically captures the eternal fight for civil rights in one crucial regard It too seems without end.

Shes talking to an aspiring young writer played by Emma Stone but she could just as easily be addressing Hollywoods proclivity for planting white characters at the heart of almost every movie about heroic black characters. What would Minny make of Mississippi Burning which makes heroes of J. Edgar Hoovers FBI in the wake of the Chaney-Goodman-Schwerner murders? Or Ghosts of Mississippi which makes Medgar Evers widow Myrlie a supporting player in her own story?Its a valid beef but The Help which faced similar criticism as a best-selling novel by Kathryn Stockett is well aware of the potential pitfalls. For one Minny and her fellow domestic Aibileen (Viola Davis headed for a second Oscar nomination) are the beating heart of this highly engaging tearjerker. Just as important The Help proves wise to the ways in which the color line poisons everyone in its vicinity. It shows early-60s Jackson Miss. as a land ruled by a dehumanizing caste system that feeds on the need to maintain the status quo.The premise is enough to send Spike Lee into paroxysms of rage. A rebellious Southern belle named Skeeter (Emma Stone) defies her Junior League peers and launches her literary career by collecting the stories of the maids in her community for a book. Cringe. Sounds like another case of the white knight in shining armor.But theres something lived-in and genuine about this infectious melodrama. The Junior Leaguers led by Bryce Dallas Howard in an acidic turn spew refined venom. They smile and nod as they push for a civic ordinance to require homeowners to install separate bathrooms for their black domestics (""They carry different public diseases than we do"" explains the ringleader). The kinder members of the older generation including Allison Janney as Skeeters mom cant (and generally dont want to) see the civil rights handwriting on the wall. Stockett and director Tate Taylor both Jackson natives have a keen sense of the denial that defined the Jim Crow South.It helps to have Davis and Spencer leading the charge. Davis is one of those rare actresses who can convey a world of emotion in the span of a few seconds. Spencer delivers much of the movies comic relief without sacrificing Minnys dignity; like Stone shes blessed with eyes that say enough to render most words superfluous.The Help has a weakness for the Big Moment and the cut-away shot that plucks at the heartstrings; Taylor isnt aiming for subtlety here but nuance mixes in with the cornpone. In a brief aside The Help handles the Evers assassination with more class than does Ghosts. A quick shot of patrons lining up for the colored-only movie-theater balcony speaks eloquently for a time and place.The Help will be a talker and the conversation it generates will remind of recent history without preaching a sermon. Yes Hollywood still has a way of bleaching black stories. But this one is told well and its smart enough to know who its real heroes are.The HelpB+ Starring Viola Davis Emma Stone Octavia Spencer Bryce Dallas Howard Jessica Chastain Allison Janney and Ahna OReilly.

Share Tweet The civil-rights movement might have ended segregation and beat back centuries of slavery and oppression but lets save a slow clap for well-meaning white folks with the moral courage to put themselves at the center of the narrative. Based on the bestest-seller by Kathryn Stockett The Help joins Glory Cry Freedom Driving Miss Daisy and many other noble adaptations in filtering the black experience through the white experience but credit Stockett (and the film) for conceiving a sneaky end-around. As a progressive-minded college graduate in small-town Mississippi in 1963 Emma Stone goes about collecting testimonials for a book about the experiences of African-American maids. So you see its really their book--shes merely the conduit through which their harrowing touching stories can be told. But in reality its her book and her stories and the central conceit is just some literary flim-flammery to convince readers--and now audiences--of an authenticity that isnt remotely in evidence. A fine cast nearly brings the con across starting with Stones plucky turn as the authors surrogate an ambitious outspoken Ole Miss grad whose enlightenment puts her at odds with the belles in her hometown bridge club. Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer are better still as the two maids who volunteer to tell Stone their stories in secret in spite of the threat of unemployment or much worse. Weary and looking older than her age Davis works for an incompetent young mother (Ahna OReilly) who has just installed a separate bathroom for Davis for hygienic purposes. Though more spirited than Davis Spencer has led a no-less-tragic life but things get better for her when shes fired by a grotesquely racist housewife (Bryce Dallas Howard) and gets a new job with an outcast (Jessica Chastain) whos struggling to manage a large estate. Shot like an inductee in the Hallmark Hall Of Fame The Help covers an ugly era in superficial gloss thats only punctured by the particulars of Mississippi race law or hiring practices that are a mere hairsbreadth away from slavery. Though broadly sketched Davis and Spencer come closest to creating flesh-and-blood characters but the film registers their grievances and triumphs against cardboard types like Howards snooty Klanswoman-in-floral. The whole thing is rigged for crowd-pleasing payoffs--a bit about chocolate pie gets more mileage than a Prius--and those payoffs are about honoring white viewers for not being horrible racists.

A corny notion perhaps -- and surely not his own to begin with -- but its a noble thought all the same. Maybe the entirely fictional Skeeter Phelan (Emma Stone) was given the same advice at Ole Miss before she graduated and returned home to Jackson Mississippi only to find herself upset by the rigid social structure of her white friends and continual dismissal of their black maids in the summer of 62. Or maybe more selfishly she pitched a book anonymously chronicling the frustrations of the help to a big-city publisher strictly to make a name for herself. Whatever her motivation Skeeter earns first the trust of Aibileen (Viola Davis) then that of Minny (Octavia Spencer) and begins to write a book bound to upset the likes of Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard) the kind of woman who proposes that every white family should have a separate bathroom for the help to use in order to keep them from spreading ""their diseases."" Tate Taylors adaptation of Kathryn Stocketts best-selling novel The Help proceeds to span years of desperation and doubt as Aibileen and Minny are increasingly put-upon and yet also in danger of being accosted for speaking out of turn. As the stakes grow higher in a time and place defined by Jim Crow laws so does the necessity for such an expose. As a look at an important era in race relations its a typically tidy portrait -- the white character needs the black characters as much the reverse. But as a character study its well-measured and very well-acted with a welcome amount of humor countering the endless parade of heartache. Stone is likeable by default all wide-eyed and committed to being her own woman (with gasp a job). More importantly Spencer and Davis run hot and cold wonderfully as Minnys outspoken ways help urge the more stoic Aibileen to speak up for herself. Aibileen has been raising white girls her whole life only to know that they will grow up to be every bit as insecure and ignorant as their mothers; in Jackson as was the case across the South the help were a critical yet unsung part of the family unit whose own children had to be cared by others until they had to forsake education for jobs of their own. And its this unfailing inequality that gets under Davis skin; her performance is kept at a simmer throughout and never quite boils over because to do so at the time might have proven fatal. Spencers sense of sass is welcome but Davis really gets to the heart of the matter in a spectacularly understated way. Broader are Dallas Howard all afluster while practically making an art out of dismissive gestures and sneers and a virtually unrecognizable Jessica Chastain as the bubbly blonde who offers Minny a job after Hilly has warned all other white women away from her. Celia isnt acting out of spite though as much as Hilly likes to think; she just wants to be the perfect housewife for her husband without having a clue how to cook or clean for herself. The bond of sisterhood that carries Aibileen and Minny through tough times is nicely contrasted against the Hilly-Celia dynamic in which the hollow sanctity of social circles causes whites to ostracize one another in addition to blacks. Oh but thats not all. I havent even mentioned Hillys forgetful but considerate mother (played well by Sissy Spacek) or Skeeters cancer-stricken mother (Allison Janney) or Skeeters mysteriously absent maid (Cicely Tyson) or Skeeters would-be suitor (Chris Lowell). Such a labor of love this was that I fear Taylor either didnt cut much or didnt cut out enough in his translation to the screen; the film runs nearly two and a half hours all told and it risks losing its impact with each additional turn of the screw. On top of that there is a moment involving a pie that while adding considerable levity and an extra dose of scandal to the proceedings seems to be out of another type of film altogether. Granted Taylor doesnt end things with a big courtroom speech or anything; if anything the ending seems to be continually postponed as a much-discussed banquet finally happens and then the publication of the book takes place and then we get the response to the book. He doesnt want to bail on his characters and in the name of giving credit where its due he keeps his focus on finding personal closure in favor of the grandstanding gestures that tend to define films of this ilk. The Help backs the idea that even the smallest change can matter and while it may not always be subtle it pulls off a rare feat of sincerity -- its corny perhaps but noble all the same.

Theyd been living intertwined lives after all since the days of slavery. The Help an emotionally enveloping sharply alive big-canvas adaptation of Kathryn Stocketts powerful 2009 novel is rooted in that truth more deeply than just about any Hollywood movie I can name. It understands that the ""separation"" of the races in the South wasnt just a crime -- it was a grand illusion. Early on Aibileen Clark (Viola Davis) grave and solid with a look so impassive it takes you a moment to see the silent protest in her eyes tells us that shes a maid just like her mother and that her grandmother was a house slave. Its 1961 and the matter-of-fact way that she delivers that information is startling because shes really telling us that shes a house slave too. Shes just called by a different title. She also says that she has raised 17 white children so thats another way that the word maid seems inadequate. Shes a nanny -- and in many ways a surrogate mother. Set in Jackson Miss. -- the middle-class heart of the Deep South -- The Help is Aibileens story and its also the story of her best friend Minny (Octavia Spencer) a pixie-faced rascal of a housekeeper/cook whos as feisty and contemptuous as Aibileen is circumspect. Davis and Spencer are both brilliant etching these womens hopes and broken dreams with every line and between the lines too. The film is also about their comrades and about the women they work for -- a group of eager perky housewives (theyre like Southern-fried Betty Drapers) who are just the sort of bridge-club-and-benefit types that the movies love to caricature. Yet one of the scrupulous pleasures of The Help is that there isnt a caricature in it. Every woman on screen is fresh live and three-dimensional whether its Elizabeth (Ahna OReilly) the girlish conformist who cedes her motherly duties including nurturing to Aibileen; Hilly (Bryce Dallas Howard) the snarling princess and out-of-the-closet racist who thinks that by forcing Minny to use a bathroom out back shes preserving the cause of racial harmony (shes keeping everything in its place); or Celia (Jessica Chastain) the flaky lost Marilyn-esque white-trash rich girl who hires Minny on the sly. In The Help the issue of the bathroom becomes nearly mythic -- the domestic equivalent of lunch counters and the back of the bus. Bryce Dallas Howard playing the soul of what had to be changed gives a fearless performance her smile treacherous her eyes awake to every nuance of subservience (from her maid and her friends too). Hillys old cohort just returned from college is Skeeter Phelan (Emma Stone) who has already outgrown this circle but isnt quite sure where to turn. She takes a job at the Jackson Journal doing a cleaning-advice column and since she knows nothing about housework she decides to get notes from Aibileen. That in part is what spurs Skeeter to do a book of interviews with the maids of Jackson telling the story of Southern domestic life from their point of view. The book is dangerous to write and ends up causing quite a stir and thats the films main motor. Ive loved Stone as a wide-eyed comic sprite but here playing a young woman more no-nonsense than anyone around her she doesnt just sparkle -- she holds the movie together. Pestering her mother (Allison Janney) to tell her why Constantine the family maid of 29 years was mysteriously let go she makes you feel everything that maid meant to her. And Cicely Tyson in flashbacks makes Constantine with her speech impediment so vulnerable yet squinchy-eloquent that your heart breaks for her. The Help has a saucy humorous side. The film turns on a hilariously vengeful incident in which Minny delivers a very just dessert to Hilly. After a while though the humiliation wrung out of that moment becomes overkill. The Help was written and directed by Tate Taylor who is not a film artist (I kept trying to imagine what Robert Altman might have done with this ensemble) yet he keeps hitting full sturdy notes of straight-down-the-middle emotion. The movie isnt perfect; it sometimes shows its stitching. But mostly its a stirring salute to subjugated women who hold their heads high.

Mae Mobley is plump and ungainly; she looks charming in a diaper but not in the sort of frilly dresses her mother favors. Its 1962 in the Deep South far from the age of Oprah-style self-affirmation yet the black maid gives the white girl a daily mantra which the child dutifully repeats ""You is kind. You is smart. You is important."" The irony is inescapable How likely is it that anyone white and over the age of 3 has ever said those kinds of nice things to weary hardworking Aibileen? Certainly not Elizabeth (Ahna OReilly) Maes distant foolish mother who is overseeing construction of a separate bathroom for Aibileens use. The Help based on Kathryn Stocketts best-selling novel couldnt state its intentions more clearly the shame of how little respect is paid to this good woman should and will be righted in the course of the film. Even the way Jackson Miss. is shot -- lush and in perpetual sunlight -- promises a warm-hearted resolution. Casual constant racism toward black domestics will not end entirely but there is no doubt that revenge will be served warm to the central villain Hilly (Bryce Dallas Howard) an adult Mean Girl whose ""eww cooties"" sensibility sets the tone for Elizabeths social set. (Read ""Watch the Throne Review A Gold-Plated Luxury Vehicle with a Message."") There is something about The Help that feels familiar and old-fashioned as if it came out of that 1970s Brians Song and Roots era of tears and lessons. Its also familiar because Hollywood stories of racism usually skew to the white character leading the charge against injustice (Mississippi Burning Glory Cry Freedom). In Stocketts book the feisty white heroine Skeeter is tall gawky frizzy-haired and cant get a date; to play Skeeter in the movie pretty graceful Emma Stone just puts on glasses and some tomboy airs. Shes not bad but this was a poor casting choice. Skeeter is a bluestocking having developed liberal notions and journalistic aspirations at college that put her at odds with her old friends Hilly and Elizabeth. Its her idea to write a book using accounts by Aibileen and her best friend Minny (Octavia Spencer a sassy eye-roller) Hillys maid and other domestics to expose how rotten the white women are to their servants. (Read ""Box Office Wrap Going Ape for Rise of the Planet."") But for every obvious turn The Help takes there is Davis the ideal counterweight. In the scenes with little Mae Aibileens affection for the girl is obvious and so is her sense of dread that she a paid employee is more important to the child than her mother. Her eyes do tenfold the work of director Tate Taylors screenplay. Thats not an insult. On the contrary Taylors adaptation is a finely crafted distillation of the book; even at two and a half hours it never lags. (Interestingly he has more acting experience than directing credits but he has known Stockett for a long time which helped him land this sought-after gig.) Though it is only August it is safe to say Davis will be nominated for an Oscar. (Just 11 minutes on screen in 2008s Doubt landed her a best-supporting nomination.) But The Help is fat with other class acts including Sissy Spacek (as Hillys selectively senile mother) and Allison Janney (as Skeeters healthy-looking sick mother). Cicely Tyson has about five minutes on screen all of them tearjerking. Jessica Chastain shows something of the flair and versatility of the young Julianne Moore in the part of Celia Foote the polar opposite of her dreamy Madonna turn in The Tree of Life. Celia is ripe with cleavage fluffy hair and Marilyn Monroe-style giggles and grins. She married into money doesnt know how to get these wretched socialites to stop treating her like poor white trash and wouldnt know how to be racist. Shes too good to be true. So is The Help. Like Driving Miss Daisy it paints a pessimistic picture and then steadily brightens it. Its easy to pick sides easy to feel good about every educational mud pie in Miss Hillys face. But there is nothing easy about Davis uncompromising performance. She makes The Help impossible to dismiss.

Photo Emma Stone (front) with Alllison Janney. Oprah must be kicking herself. Her show went off the air before she could devote a very special episode to the female-centered civil rights drama ""The Help."" Performances by Viola Davis Octavia Spencer and Emma Stone certainly merit that kind of attention. The movie unfortunately does not. This flawed adaptation of Kathryn Stocketts best-selling novel about black maids and their white employers in early-1960s Jackson Miss. aims for ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" significance but lands in ""Steel Magnolias"" territory. Like that weepy 80s flick it portrays Southern women their unspoken rivalries and alliances sugary cruelty and dont-eff-with-me breaking points. Maids Aibileen Clark (Davis) and Minny Jackson (Spencer) as well as aspiring journalist Eugenia ""Skeeter"" Phelan (Stone) live in a world of predetermined roles none of which fit them well. PHOTOS EMMA STONES RISE TO STARDOM MOVIE BLOG MORE ON THE HELP Back in Jackson after graduating from Ole Miss Skeeter squirms as her now-married college roommate Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard cartoonishly villainous) talks of ""the colored problem"" and lobbies for segregated bathrooms in every house. Skeeter is more interested in secretly interviewing Aibileen who works for a friend about the humiliations of life as a maid in the Deep South. A New York book editor (Mary Steenburgen) has given Skeeter a cautious go-ahead advising her to get the project done ""before this civil rights thing blows over."" And she wants interviews with lots more maids. Aibileen whose grown son was killed by racist negligence reluctantly begins pouring her heart out. The granddaughter of a slave shes raised 17 white children in households where she couldnt use the front door or eat off the same dishes. She tries to teach them tolerance but then they grow up to emulate their parents. Davis brings as much nuance as she can to this martyrish role. The animated Spencer has most of the fun as Minny a cook with a fiery temper. Working at Hillys Minny knows the white commode is off-limits -- but balks when ordered to use the outhouse in a tornado. Fired Minny goes to work for Celia (Jessica Chastain) a Marilyn Monroe-esque newcomer from the dirt-poor town of -- surely theres a country song about this? -- Sugar Ditch. Shes married to Hillys wealthy ex-boyfriend and has thus made an enemy of the most powerful mean girl in Jackson. Minny has too -- she cant resist getting even with her ex-boss using a nasty prank that may put weaker-stomached audience members off chocolate pie forever. Shes justifiably worried about reprisal though the film minimizes the racial violence in Stocketts novel. Learning of Hillys comeuppance her spitfire mother (Sissy Spacek) gleefully cackles ""Run Minny Run"" Its hilarious--unless you reflect on what happened to black people who didnt run fast enough in Mississippi. The murder of black civil rights activist Medgar Evers and other injustices persuade additional maids to tell their stories to Skeeter whos coping with a cancer-riddled mom (Alison Janney) a weirdly ambivalent suitor (Chris Lowell) and the mystery of what happened to her own familys maid Constantine (Cicely Tyson barely seen). Director Tate Taylor is a childhood friend of Stockett and hasnt done much else which may be why ""The Help"" feels clumsy but well-intentioned. The best moments here are not the big revelations but the intimate details. One of them is a speech about the many uses for Crisco. Apparently it can fix everything from squeaky door hinges to under-eye circles -- too bad it cant smooth over clunky directing. ""The Help"" is like a lot of Southern fare made with Crisco youll want to gobble it up but its not particularly nourishing. sstewartnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Justin Bieber earning reputation for being Hollywoods Big...

By Peter Rainer Film critic August 9 2011 Save for later Saved In this film publicity image released by Disney from left Emma Stone Octavia Spencer and Viola Davis are shown in a scene from The Help. Dale Robinette/Disney/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of ""The Help"" based on the big 2009 bestseller by Kathryn Stockett is set in Jackson Miss. in 1963 and the movie itself sometimes looks like it was made in 1963. Despite its subject matter - the injustice of black-white race relations in the South at the dawn of the civil rights movement - its a carefully manicured almost genteel piece of moviemaking. The film is paradoxically both rousing and lulling.Skeeter Phelan (Emma Stone) a misfit belle recently graduated from college writes the cleaning tips column for her local newspaper. She cant pin down the reason why Constantine (Cicely Tyson) the beloved family maid was let go. Charlotte (Allison Janney) Skeeters ailing mother offers up only patently false excuses.The relationship between Skeeter and Constantine was clearly closer than Skeeters bond with her mother. Among other things ""The Help"" is about the intense emotional connection between white children and the black maids who raised them. These same children as adults with their own children to raise often hold their maids in disdain. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Aibileen Clark (Viola Davis) has raised 17 white children in Jackson during a time when she lost her own son. Far more sensitive to racial grievances than it would appear any other white woman in Jackson Skeeter warily coaxes Aibileen to tell her story for a book she plans to write that eventually includes the stories of other local maids. (Rather too obviously we get a glimpse of Skeeters bookshelf which includes ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" and ""Native Son."")Even cloaked in anonymity Skeeters book project is dangerous. The killing of civil rights worker Medger Evers which burst onto the TV news halfway through the movie is only the most overt instance of how high the racial stakes are. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? The writer-director Tate Taylor a childhood friend of Stocketts from Jackson with only one previous feature film to his credit positions Skeeter and Aibileen as the twin heroes of the piece. Actually theres a third - Aibileens best friend Minny Jackson (Octavia Spencer) a maid who finds it difficult to suffer fools gladly - an occupational hazard to say the least.On the other side of this exalted triumvirate are all those white women who are still comfortable with the way things are run in the Jim Crow South. The films chief target is Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard) president of the local Junior League who is pushing a bill that would require employers to build separate outdoor bathrooms for the help. It should not have been necessary for Taylor to caricature Hilly and the gossipy others who also include scowly Elizabeth (Ahna OReilly) Aibileens boss and the childless flirty trailer-trash Celia (Jessica Chastain). The ordeals of Aibileen and the other maids are sufficiently powerful without having to stack the deck.Did the filmmakers perhaps feel that they would be capitulating to racism if they portrayed Hilly and her sister belles with a smidgen more ""understanding""? (The men in the film barely register.) But comprehending a characters actions is not the same thing as endorsing them. The intense superficiality of Hilly and the others is a disservice to the emotional complexity of racism and what it does to people black and white.The superficiality is doubly felt because the performances by Stone - but especially by Davis and Spencer - are so much more deeply felt. A lifetime of pain is in Aibileens weary rectitude and hard-set eyes. Minny though much more flamboyant carries the same burdens. The presence of these two women which is ennobling without falsifying that nobility with sentimentality periodically lifts ""The Help"" into a higher realm than given its civics-lesson trappings it probably deserves.At the same time I would defend ""The Help"" simplistic though it is against the charge some have leveled against it for being ""patronizing."" Its true that by framing the maids stories through Skeeters lens the film implicitly overvalues the historical contribution of whites to the civil rights movement. But this film is a far cry from say ""Mississippi Burning"" which made white FBI agents into civil rights heroes.There are not so many stirring full-fledged black characters on the screen particularly black female characters that we should feel it necessary to downgrade the few that we have by playing the blame game.

"The Help Its fine work all around - USATODAY.com Skip to Main Content USA TODAY Subscribe Mobile Home News Travel Money Sports Life Your Life Tech Weather The Help Its fine work all around By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Updated Comments Reprints amp; Permissions It would seem difficult even odd to make a sunny and upbeat drama about racial prejudice. Dale Robinette AP Emma Stone stars in The Help based on the popular book by Kathryn Stockett. EnlargeClose Dale Robinette AP Emma Stone stars in The Help based on the popular book by Kathryn Stockett. But The Help with its emphasis on an unlikely friendship transcending segregated strictures manages this tricky feat. It also personalizes the broader issue of civil rights by focusing on one slice of the black experience. And fans of the best-selling novel can rest easy The warmly engaging book has been made into an equally affecting movie. Powered by a strong cast The Help is a faithful adaptation of Kathryn Stocketts novel. A trio of outstanding performances carry the film on their strong shoulders. VIDEO Have a little helping of The Help MORE Octavia Spencer maxes out Minny in The Help MORE Little stars of The Help have own story The story is set in Jackson Miss. in 1963 and centers on Skeeter (Emma Stone) a recent college graduate determined to document the life experiences of African-American maids who endure all manner of disrespect catering to white society folks. At best their employers take them for granted; at worst they are treated as if they are subhuman. In the course of this project which involves the women meeting on the sly to tell their personal stories a bond is forged between Skeeter Aibileen (Viola Davis) and Minny (Octavia Spencer) that flies in the face of the eras societal limitations. Their sisterhood evolves slowly and naturally. The Help    out of four Stars Emma Stone Viola Davis Octavia Spencer Bryce Dallas Howard Jessica Chastain Cicely Tyson Mike Vogel Allison Janney Sissy Spacek Director Tate Taylor DistributorDreamWorks Pictures Rating PG-13 for thematic material Running time 2 hours 17 minutes Opens today in select cities As long-suffering maids to particularly loathsome women in Skeeters circle Davis and Spencer give pitch-perfect performances. Davis is remarkable as the cautious Aibileen communicating years of suffering and fear with the most subtle expressions. Despite the hardships she has endured she is warmly loving to a little girl ignored by her pampered mother. Spencer who is more often seen in comic roles brings the multifaceted character of Minny to vivid life. We unabashedly root for her as she takes unusual revenge on the employer who cruelly mistreated her. Spencer visibly seethes and imbues her character with deadpan humor as she endures the belittling of her smug racist employer Hilly (Bryce Dallas Howard). The third noteworthy portrayal is by Jessica Chastain as Celia a kind-hearted outsider who dresses like a bombshell and is ostracized by the snobbish young women under bossy Hillys sway. Chastain makes a powerful impression as a fragile young wife hiding a painful secret. The likable Stone -- so sharp in satirical teen comedies like Easy A-- feels a bit too contemporary in this role. Her Southern accent tends to waver. The movie wisely focuses less on Skeeter than on the maids she chronicles. As she absorbs the womens personal sagas Skeeters conviction to become a writer is strengthened along with her need to know what happened to her beloved maid Constantine (Cicely Tyson). The book gave that subplot more heft. Here it feels tacked on. Tyson has too little screen time though what she has is memorable and moving. The Help sidesteps easy sentimentality. As the films heart and soul Davis and Spencer add vast reserves of depth and dignity to a crowd-pleasing tale. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

Id done a little weeping while reading Kathryn Stocketts lively -- if brazenly string-pulling -- 2009 novel about black maids and their white mistresses in the Deep South. Yet while my neighbor had used up her hankie supply by the end of the movie I left dry-eyed and disappointed. Set in Mississippi on the cusp of the civil rights movement Stocketts best-seller -- based in part on her own family experiences -- is deftly constructed and briskly paced. She has an attentive ear for multiple voices and a sympathetic feel for the ambivalent ties that bound the privileged lunching ladies of the Junior League to the black women who raised their children just as they had been raised while their own mothers made the bridge club rounds. Adapted and directed by Hollywood hopeful Tate Taylor a childhood friend of Stocketts The Help trots stolidly after the book replicating its basic structure while ironing out the verve with which its nested stories unfold. Taylor has none of Stocketts feel for the seething impulses of character and he has a clunky way with some serious acting talent. In fairness Emma Stone the exuberant young star of Easy A may not be built for earnest melodrama but shes unaccountably tamped-down as Skeeter the spirited young daughter of white privilege who powers this tale of racism and tentative reconciliation. In an effort to launch a career in journalism (""the last stop before marriage"" one of her lunch chums cries merrily) and uncover the secret behind the disappearance of her own beloved nanny (Cicely Tyson) Skeeter embarks on a series of clandestine interviews with Aibileen (Viola Davis) a stoical middle-aged maid submerging her grief over the death of her own son in her love for the little white girl shes raising in the shadow of an indifferent young mother. Cutting between their stories Stockett produced a portrait of a community painfully and at times hilariously awakening to the demise of its discriminatory system. This is a hard thing to pull off without winking at an audience familiar with how this story continued. Where Stockett told her story from the inside Taylor suspends it in historical quotes with heavy-breathing allusions to the death of President Kennedy the shooting of Medgar Evers and inevitably the wicked fashion sense of Jackie O. i Fearing retribution from their employers Minny and Aibileen are at first reluctant to share their stories but they eventually come around to allow Skeeter a glimpse into their world. Dale Robinette/Dreamworks Pictures hide caption toggle caption Dale Robinette/Dreamworks Pictures Fearing retribution from their employers Minny and Aibileen are at first reluctant to share their stories but they eventually come around to allow Skeeter a glimpse into their world. Dale Robinette/Dreamworks Pictures Big hair fine period frocks and interior design lend The Help a pleasingly retro look. Yet for someone who grew up in Mississippi the director has little sense of place unless you count one decidedly low-rent tornado and a few inside shots of a black church. Unlike Stockett who might have been better off writing her own screenplay Taylor has a tin ear for the vernacular speech of his own region. Much of the dialogue seems lifted from Margaret Mitchell with the result that virtually no one escapes caricature from Bryce Dallas Howard anxiously overdoing a vicious housewife who has made it her lifes mission to bar servants from their employers bathrooms to Sissy Spacek marooned in an excruciating dotty-old-lady role as her mother to Jessica Chastain as a good-hearted white-trash interloper trying to break into a circle as conscious of class as it is bigoted about color. Worst of all the pivotal figure of Minny (Octavia Spencer) a motor-mouthed maid with a gift for ruffling white feathers has been broadened into something approaching a black mammy then drafted in the movies last act into an episode of The Jeffersons complete with revenge in the form of chocolate pie containing suspect ingredients. In his lumbering way Taylor makes Stocketts story his own by expanding the books mild lavatorial metaphors for the ill-considered farce that pretty much takes over the movies last act. All of which shoves into the background some beautifully tempered acting by one of our great character actresses. Holding the line for intelligent restraint Davis Aibileen subtly navigates the blend of loyalty and rising anger that binds her to her employers then leads her to break free. Under Davis skillful hand Aibileen emerges as the reluctant heroine of The Help the dignified face of nonviolent resistance and the one who argues wordlessly for the union between two people on opposite sides of the racial divide that ends this rather wishful tale.

Slideshow The Help Premiere Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon More about The Help >> For instance the practice of separate toilet accommodations for blacks which precipitates the films action. Some white employers believed that the women who raised their babies washed their laundry and prepared their meals would by sharing the privy contaminate their families. It would be easy to regard the movie by Tate Taylor who adapted the book and directed as a nostalgic portrait of black dignity in the face of such casual bigotry. Easier still to dismiss it as the work of a white filmmaker who with one hand slaps himself in the face for the sins of his grandmother and with the other pats himself on the back for his expiation of those sins. But The Help set in 1962 Mississippi is more complex and compassionate and nuanced than that. Like its characters it has its faults. But overall it is a movie of imaginative sympathy that gets into the skin of its characters into their hearts and ultimately into ours. From Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer as domestics to Bryce Dallas Howard and Jessica Chastain as their employers to Emma Stone as an idealist who encourages ""the help"" to share their stories for an oral history shes collecting the performances are soul-stirring and hope-raising. (An oral history of black domestics in 1962? Not bloody likely. The Help is better viewed as an emotionally accurate story than a historically accurate one.) The action takes place in Jackson Miss. nearly a decade after the constitutionality of separate-but-equal education has been overturned. Still Hilly (Howard) helmet-coiffed leader of the Junior League initiates a ""sanitary campaign"" to encourage members to install separate toilets for the housekeepers. Aibileen (Davis in the screen role that her fans have been waiting for) delivers an emotionally devastating and triumphant performance as the ramrod-spined granddaughter of a house slave carrying on the family business. ""Raising white babies is what I do"" she tells the idealist writer Skeeter crisply. ""I learned that I can make babies proud of themselves."" And she also learned to conceal her own pride. Skeeters question - ""Did you ever dream of being anything else?"" - encourages Aibileen to slowly reveal her shattered dreams and dare to build new ones. Look at how Davis uses her body. When first we see Aibileen her muscles and essence are contracted. When she recognizes her rigidity is an emotional armor she no longer needs there is a release and expansion of muscle and spirit that infuses the movie. As in the novel Aibileen is the frame of the story. Because of Taylors choices and Davis formidable presence Aibileen also emerges as the principal figure in this group portrait of women at the cusp of social transformation. If Davis is the soul of the enterprise Octavia Spencer as Minny Aibileens short-fused and outspoken best friend is the funny bone. Along with Sissy Spacek as the impish mother of the Junior League dictator Hilly (the coolly intimidating Howard) Spencer provides the levity to complement Davis gravity. As Skeeter Stone functions as a sounding board. Her questions help Aibileen and Minny to tell and hear their own stories help Skeeter see herself and Southern traditions from another perspective. Stone a playful and antic actress puts the brakes on here. Except for one volatile scene with Allison Janney as her mother it is not her best work. But she gets the job done. Himself an actor Taylor is focused more on the performances than on cinematic storytelling. He has a good cinematographer in Stephen Goldblatt who distills the heat and humidity of the Mississippi locations. He has a most evocative costume designer in Sharen Davis who subtly contrasts the floral bubble-skirted dresses of the Junior Leaguers with the tailored dove-gray maids uniforms. And he gets added uplift from Thomas Newmans optimistic score. The artists job said surrealist painter Paul Klee is to make the invisible visible. By making central the backstories and experiences of marginalized women that is precisely what The Help achieves. Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

By Meghan Keane  08/09/11 805pm Octavia Spencer and Viola Davis in The Help. If fried chicken were really as restorative as the new movie The Help seems to think Jim Crow laws probably wouldnt have originated in the South. But in the world of Kathryn Stocketts novel (and now film) Southern stereotypes are given a retro glossy sheen and ingrained racial tension can be resolved by a plucky white debutantes first novel. In the real world the chances of an earnest deb resolving the racial tensions in 1960s Jackson Miss. with her first writing project would have been pretty slim. But if you can suspend your disbelief that a cute 22 year-old had the power to succeed with civil rights where Martin Luther King and President Kennedy failed The Help actually has a lot to offer. Ms. Stocketts story follows Skeeter Phelan (Emma Stone) a recent graduate of Ole Miss who returns to her hometown of Jackson to find that her girlfriends have calcified into terrible approximations of their mothers. Theyve been raised by strong black women but instead of appreciating that work they are now employing (and mistreating) those same women in their own homes. The ringleader of this group is Miss Hilly (Bryce Dallas Howard) who prances around town spearheading a disturbing initiative to get white families to build separate toilets outside their homes for ""the help."" Disgusted by her peerss racism Skeeter decides to publish the stories of some of her friends maids in an effort to jumpstart her journalism career and try to achieve some justice for these women. Inserting a white woman into these maids stories is a strange rhetorical trick which is partly why Ms. Stocketts novel earned plenty of critics when it debuted in 2009. But that didnt slow its rise up the best-sellers list or get in the way of wooing a stellar cast (despite the fact that director Tate Taylor only has one feature under his belt and got the rights because he is a childhood friend of Ms. Stocketts). And the uneven racial terrain of the film likely wont stand in the way of multiple nominations for some truly outstanding performances throughout the movie. Unfortunately Ms. Stones is not one of them. Its not entirely her fault. There is something incredibly unsettling about needing a white socialite narrator to tell the story of abused black women and Emma Stone does not possess the acting nuance to pull it off. In The Help the sexy raspy voice and adorable delivery that served her well in light teen films like Easy A and Superbad just arent enough. Shes in far over her head here and so are the many young women who prance around the screen like theyre trying on their mothers vintage clothes with just a dash of period-piece racism added to the look. More powerful is how well Viola Davis (as Aibileen Clark) and Octavia Spencer (as Minny Jackson) take to their roles as maids who endure the difficulties of growing up black and poor in the South. Its hard to avoid falling into stereotypes when playing such a stock character type but Ms. Davis and Ms. Spencer expertly draw Aibileen and Minny as smart agile women struggling to survive in a culture pit against them. Their wisdom and cooking skills may be mystically overdrawn but these women can make you believe anything. Only Cicely Tyson borders on mammyism as the elderly maid who raised Skeeter but she brings a strong emotive tug into each of her short scenes. In general the older actresses fair better than their younger counterparts. Sissy Spacek has a blast as Miss Hillys mother who often uses bouts of Alzheimers to her advantage. And Allison Janney does her best as Skeeters thinly drawn mother. Jessica Chastain is the only young actress who manages to own her character instilling a bombshell trophy wife with humor and depth. In contrast Ms. Stone has been given some strange direction to play up her awkward side. She uncomfortably bounces through scenes in a series of improbably awful wigs and the character of Skeeter often appears naive to the point of undermining her own efforts. Which might actually be the most optimistic thing about The Help. Maybe next time these black actresses wont need a white narrator to get their films made.

(AP Photo/Disney Dale Robinette) <<12>>Break out the hankies.The glossy Hollywood movie version of Kathryn Stocketts runaway best-seller ""The Help"" hits theaters Wednesday and its virtually guaranteed to be the chick flick of the summer especially for the hard-core book-club set. Of course men who arent afraid to get a little misty at movies that dont involve sports heavy artillery or Old Yeller should also check it out if they fancy a good cry. Director-screenwriter Tate Taylor and Stockett are childhood pals who grew up in each others pockets in Jackson Miss. in the 70s which means the film has one quality that the vast majority of movie adaptations of literature lack a sense of authenticity. So often you get the distinct impression that the director never even bothered to read the book in question. Here you can see Taylors love for the material and his affinity for the rich and thorny heritage of the deep South in every lovingly crafted frame. From the Southern drawl to the sticky-heat the director took pains to get it just right. Advertisement The languid cadence of life in Mississippi pulses through Stephen Goldblatts leisurely cinematography as Skeeter (it-girl Emma Stone) returns from Ole Miss eager to make her bones as a writer. As the plucky little gal settles back into life in her hometown her best friend Stepford-debutante Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard is so hard and cold in this role you get frostbite looking at her) tries to ban black maids from using the bathrooms of the white folks they tend to. For the first time Skeeter sees the racism corroding every aspect of a pampered lifestyle she always had taken for granted.Sensing she has found her big break Skeeter sets out to tell the tale of the Jim Crow era through the eyes of ""The Help."" She turns to two maids she has known all her life but never thought much about brokenhearted Aibileen (Viola Davis) and spitfire Minny (Octavia Spencer). Harnessing a gravitas she honed on the stage (she won a Tony for her turn in the ""Fences"" revival) Davis owns this picture. This is an unflinching portrayal of a proud woman who has buried her indignation under polite smiles for so many years that she has almost forgotten that she exists outside of her starched-gray uniform. In Davis hands Aibileens quiet pain is so intense that its hard not to wince a little as queen bee Hilly attacks her dignity and the status quo denies her rage. Day after day year after year downcast Aibileen trudges to work radiating suffering like a dying star. When Skeeter asks her to tell her story its the first time any white person has paid her the compliment of treating her like a human. She finally finds her voice which she promptly raises in a deeply inspirational act of protest. Indeed the aching tragedy of Aibileens life (her only son died after being turned away from a white hospital) might be unbearable were it not for the salvation of Minnys unfettered sauciness. Like Aibileen she has bridled under bigotry all her life but she refuses to be bowed. When Minny dishes out a heaping helping of revenge on the villain of the piece the debutante diva Hilly it is a moment of wonderfully gross catharsis. Hint It involves the ickiest pie outside of ""Titus Andronicus."" Stone is also notable for bringing an unassuming spunk to Skeeter who gets dismissed as a cranky old maid because she has not nabbed a husband by age 23. The scenes between Skeeter and her mother (a moving Allison Janney) who has unwittingly succumbed to the racism inherent in their culture have a gut-wrenching honesty about the prickly mother-daughter dynamic. Speaking of which invaluable Sissy Spacek shines like diamonds in her all-too-tiny part as Hillys sadly neglected mother a feisty old Southern belle who has not let fate steal her sense of humor. Certainly the movie has its flaws such as the cheesy flashbacks to Skeeters childhood and venerable Cicely Tyson not getting nearly enough screen time as Skeeters beloved nanny Constantine.Also fans of the book which has sold more than 3 million copies may balk that Taylor had to condense the story to fit the time constraints of film. For instance in the movie its not entirely clear why Minnys bombshell of a boss Celia (stunner Jessica Chastain) gets snubbed by all the society girls. Or why Constantine never kept in touch with Skeeter. But its hard to keep those quibbles in mind when youre struggling to keep your chin up. Punctuated by Mary J. Bliges heart-tugging anthem ""Living Proof"" this is one shameless tear-jerker that earns its sniffles. Contact Karen DSouza at 408-271-3772.

Starring Emma Stone Viola Davis Bryce Dallas Howard Director Tate Taylor Running time 217 Release Opened Aug 10 2011  Editorial Review Black and white and not enough HelpBy Ann HornadayWednesday Aug 10 2011Next to ""Harry Potter"" perhaps no book adaptation this summer has been more highly or anxiously anticipated than ""The Help"" based on the 2009 surprise bestseller of the same name. Fans of Kathryn Stocketts folksy ingratiating novel can rest easy The director Tate Taylor - a childhood friend of the author who like her grew up in Jackson Miss. where the story is set - has preserved the books story line characters and confiding tone with loyalty worthy of any best friend. Fair warning ""The Help"" which Taylor wrote for the screen as well as directed isnt likely to win any converts among those who couldnt abide Stocketts dialect-heavy writing and earnest but vaguely self-congratulatory tale of a young white writer who strikes up a Jim Crow-defying friendship with black domestic workers in 1963 Mississippi. But readers who felt they came to intimately know characters such as Celia Minny and Skeeter are likely to greet their alter egos on screen like cherished long-lost friends - especially the nobly suffering Aibileen here brought to quietly watchful life by Viola Davis. Indeed not surprisingly Davis is the best thing about ""The Help"" in which she stars with a veritable cavalcade of up-and-coming actresses. They include Jessica Chastain (seen this summer in ""The Tree of Life"" here delivering a complete 180 from her ethereal presence in that film with a garishly giddy performance as the wrong-side-of-the-tracks Celia); Bryce Dallas Howard as the conniving hysterically racist Hilly; and Emma Stone as Skeeter the recent Ole Miss graduate who is searching for work as a writer as ""The Help"" opens. Skeeter gets a job as a newspaper cleaning-advice columnist but when she asks Aibileen for some tips she realizes that the real story lies in the emotional lives of black women who virtually raise their white employers children but who are treated by those same families as unfit to share a kitchen utensil much less political or economic power. ""You is kind you is smart and you is impotant"" Aibileen repeatedly intones to her young white charge. As anguishing as those scenes are both in vernacular and substance theres no denying the cathartic exhilaration of watching Aibileen Minny (Octavia Spencer in a breakout performance) and Skeeter form their fragile but potent friendship even as they keep their furtive meetings secret from their respective communities. Skeeter is under her own pressures to hew to traditional definitions of Southern womanhood and get married like her friends who inherit their low-wage servants much as some of their ancestors might have inherited enslaved people. But Skeeters discomfort serves as an inadequate index for the pain and suffering of Aibileen and Minny who endanger their very lives by speaking candidly about segregations grimmest realities. One of those truths which ""The Help"" deserves praise for bringing to light is that racism should be understood less as a matter of black grievance than of unexamined white privilege and pathology. And no one is more race-crazy than Hilly portrayed by Dallas Howard in ""The Helps"" weakest performance as a cruel snake-eyed witch whose villainy extends to making Minny use an outside toilet even during a hurricane. Hillys monstrousness is in keeping with ""The Helps"" tendency to reduce its characters to stock types but it has the effect of enabling white viewers to distance themselves from racisms subtler more potent expressions. (Far more troubling than Hillys brand of insanity is the disapproving but passive acquiescence of her mother played with vinegary brio by Sissy Spacek.) With clunky episodic pacing Taylor traces the genesis and effect of Skeeters project including ""The Helps"" climactic sequence when Minny performs an act of subterfuge that depending on taste and perspective will play like a heroic act of subversion or a crass burlesque. Surely both taste and perspective will inform whether viewers will find ""The Help"" a revelatory celebration of interracial healing and transcendence or a patronizing portrait that trivializes those alliances by reducing them to melodrama and facile uplift. (By way of comparison the 2008 drama ""The Secret Life of Bees"" struck a far more sensitive observant chord in its portrayal of similar themes in a similar place and time.) As affectionately as Taylor has brought ""The Help"" to the screen and as gratifying as it is to watch Davis and Spencer bring Aibileen and Minny to palpable fully rounded life their narrative like ""The Blind Side"" a few years ago is structured largely around their white female benefactor. That this is the story we keep telling ourselves is all the more puzzling - if not galling - when viewers consider that precisely at the time that ""The Help"" transpires African Americans across Mississippi were registering to vote and agitating for political change. In other words they were helping themselves. And on screen at least their story remains largely untold. Contains thematic material.

"Movie review The Help - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-72hMovie review The HelpThe Help is an excellent adaptation of the bestselling novel about an unlikely rebellion in a Southern town in the 1960s among black maids serving white families and one white woman who wants them to tell their life stories.August 10 2011|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Viola Davis is part of the ensemble cast of ""The Help."" (DreamWorks )""The Help"" is a delicious peppery stew of home-cooked 1960s Southern-style racism that serves up a soulful dish of what ails us and what heals us. Laughter which is ladled on thick as gravy proves to be the secret ingredient a turning what should be a feel-bad movie about those troubled times into a heart-warming surprise. The movie is richly flavored by the work of a sprawling cast that puts the exceptional Viola Davis and Emma Stone at the films impassioned center with the scene-stealing tang of Octavia Spencer and the sweet-tart of Jessica Chastain thankfully never far away. Since we generally prefer not to be reminded of the darker chapters of our history its a risky business taking us back a even with a fictional tale a to Jackson Miss. at a time when African Americans were still very much the serving class. As much a part of white family life as weekly bridge clubs and church on Sunday black maids were often loved more often exploited and nearly always taken for granted. The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Medgar Evers were out there stirring things up in that season of fear but in Jackson kitchens things were being kept at a simmer. Against that backdrop ""The Help"" takes us inside an unlikely rebellion. It all begins when new Ole Miss grad Skeeter (Stone) comes back home and tries to persuade the women who cook and clean and raise the babies to tell their stories and secrets. She has a publishing career on her mind; they have uncomfortable truths and redemption on theirs. For both sides it becomes a test of courage and conviction told in a kind of Capra-esque style and I mean that in the best possible way. Kathryn Stocketts bestselling novel has given writer-director Tate Taylor a lot to chew on. Born and raised in Jackson they are longtime friends and you can feel that connection in the care with which Taylor approaches the material though the reverence is exactly what eventually trips him up. As a result the movie exists within an emotionally charged landscape sometimes too starkly black and white a there is no room for ambiguity at this table. With Taylors deep Southern roots he insisted on shooting the film on location ultimately finding the retro feel he was looking for in Greenwood Miss. Cinematographer Stephen Goldblatt whose keen sense of the South earned him an Oscar nomination for 1991s ""The Prince of Tides"" makes the most of it giving even the dirt roads and decaying frame houses a kind of gauzy beauty usually reserved for the plantation-styled manses. Production designer Mark Ricker (""Julie amp; Julia"") matches him in kind a this is a man who knows his way around kitchens an asset since it is in kitchens that much of the movie takes place. While a lot of the action happens over stoves its the toilets that become the moral proving ground a and deliver some of the movies funniest moments. That ""The Help"" can take the incendiary issue of ""separate-but-equal"" bathrooms and spin it into a series of side-splitting gags without losing sight of the underlying pain of discrimination represents a kind of comedy I thought Hollywood had forgotten how to do. You know the kind that makes us laugh while going right to the heart of the matter and comes as a blessed relief from the vapid raunch that has become the norm. Skeeters new job at the local newspaper a rejection letter from a New York publisher and the unexplained absence of Constantine the maid who raised her get things underway. From the outset she is at odds with the world she comes back to a childhood friends now grown and married are busy replicating their mothers lifestyle of polished silver properly behaved children and dinner on the table by six. Seeing that same world but with a more wounded and far wiser eye is Aibileen (Davis) whom Skeeter enlists to help her with the cleaning advice column shes writing for the paper. Ambition and insight are a dangerous mix and soon Skeeter wants to make a book out of the maids real life stories a the outrages the secrets the deep bonds and deeper hurts they share with the families they often spend a lifetime working for. But in 60s Jackson speech is not free and talking carries the possibility of losing much more than a job which is precious enough. Skeeter has always been a pea without a pod which makes it a perfect fit for Stones distinctive brand of authenticity. This is an actress who willingly lets her jaw drop and eyes roll but in the most natural of ways. The world-weary Aibileen is the perfect counterpoint to the newly minted skeptic. Davis carries the weight of history in every move she makes you feel the ache in Aibileens aging knees as she bends to comfort a crying child and there is a sadness that lingers in her eyes even when they are crinkled by laughter.1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESProducers Michael Barnathan Chris Columbus high on The...February 3 2012Critics Notebook The Help goes beyond stereotypesSeptember 6 2011The Help cast talksJuly 31 2011Sisters in spiritJuly 31 20112011 Movie Preview The HelpJanuary 16 2011MORE STORIES ABOUT72hKitchensOctavia SpencerTate TaylorCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-the-help-20110810,0,3148091.story",200,thehelp29,thehelp,latimes

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> A deeply touching human story filled with humor and heartbreak is rare in any movie season especially summer. Thats what makes The Help an exhilarating gift. It could have been a disaster. Kathryn Stocketts debut novel riled a few critics. The gall of Stockett a white woman from Jackson Mississippi to think she could get inside the heads of black maids serving white folks during the early 1960s. The dialect (""Yes maam"" ""sho-nuff"" ""Law have mercy"") probably helped Stockett get more than 60 rejections from literary agents. But her book published by Penguin in 2009 touched a raw nerve that led to bestsellerdom and a frank admission from Stockett about how she could never truly understand what it felt like to be a black woman in Mississippi at the dawn of the civil rights movement. ""But trying to understand"" Stockett wrote ""is vital to our humanity."" More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Solid point. And the film version of The Help directed and written - at Stocketts request - by the relatively inexperienced Tate Taylor (her friend from Jackson) does full justice to that intention. Short on style and flashy technique The Help on film compensates with genuine emotional force. The actors are sublime. Start with the brilliant Viola Davis (Doubt) as Aibileen Clark the housekeeper whos helped raise 17 white children for various families but is still reeling from the accidental death of her only son. Aibileen bites her tongue when her employer (Ahna OReilly) ignores her own baby girl and Aibileens feelings when shes relegated to the new bathroom outside. Aibileens best friend Minny Jackson (an award-caliber performance from Octavia Spencer) isnt one to hold back. The secret ingredient she pops in a pie for her racist boss (Bryce Dallas Howard all-stops-out) earns its name as the ""Terrible Awful."" The fired Minny is forced to take a job with white-trash social outcast Celia Foote who could have been a bombshell cliche if the incandescent Jessica Chastain (The Tree of Life) didnt play her with such warmth and feeling. The films catalyst is Eugenia ""Skeeter"" Phelan (Emma Stone) a recent graduate of Ole Miss looking to spark a career in journalism by getting Aibileen and Minny to confide their feelings about working for white families in a changing South. Skeeter is a tricky part - white girl liberates enslaved black womanhood - but Stone an exceptional talent is so subtly effective at showing Skeeters naivete. Its Skeeters job to first liberate herself from the bigoted codes passed on through generations including her mother (Allison Janney) and Skeeters own card-dealing role-playing girlfriends. The Help tries to understand all of them. Its an intimate epic not a historical one. And the tale written on the eloquent faces of Davis and Spencer speaks to the heart.

"The Help movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs The Help (3 stars) gets an assist from a memorable performance by Viola DavisAugust 09 2011|Michael Phillips | Movie criticViola Davis in ""The Help.""""The Help"" has Viola Davis going for it and she is more than enough. The actress deserves the Academy Award nomination (if not the Oscar Itself) shell be receiving come early 2012. Im not working for her; Im just passing along news of the nearly inevitable. Davis is reason No. 1 the film extracted from Kathryn Stocketts 2009 best-seller improves on its source material. You can talk all you want about how a movie begins and ends with the screenwriter(s) or lives and dies on a directors ability to use the camera as more than a recording device. But some film adaptations owe their success primarily to the rightness of the casting. ""The Help"" is one of them. Multiple profitable weeks on the best-seller list aside the reason ""The Help"" became a movie has everything to do with whos staring at us directly from the films poster image Stocketts sympathetic white protagonist played in the film by Emma Stone. Two of the other three in the poster Davis and Octavia Spencer (the help) relate to each other while the third Bryce Dallas Howard (the despicable queen bee of privilege early 1960s Jackson Miss. edition) regards her nails. Like ""Glory"" the film about the African-American fighting men of the Civil War that was really about Matthew Brodericks character becoming a more liberal humanitarian ""The Help"" positions Stones character -- the budding journalist who undertakes a clandestine book project gathering stories from the African-American housekeepers and child-raisers of Jackson -- front and center. If this sounds like trouble there is good news The writer-director of the film Tate Taylor has wisely adjusted the books focus so that instead of three narrators taking turns Davis character Aibileen Clark becomes the storys quietly dominant voice. In the poster for ""The Help"" this inspired actresss guarded wary body language and neutral mask speak volumes about a place a time a world ripe for social adjustment. Theres more acting going on in the poster than in many an entire feature. Stone plays Miss Skeeter who is clearly too good for Jackson and its snippy racists. She lucks into a job on the Jackson Journal as an advice columnist writing under the handle ""Miss Myrna"" dealing with matters of domestic engineering. Skeeter elicits advice and counsel from Aibileen who has raised 17 white children for lousy pay and immeasurable grief from a variety of employers who like Mississippi the way it is thank you very much. Then responding to the civil rights scent in the air Skeeter persuades Aibileen and her best friend and fellow domestic Minny played by Spencer to reveal something of their life stories under pseudonyms. Once published Skeeters book scandalizes the curdled cream of Jackson society embodied by Howards character Hilly. If only Jessica Chastain wonderful as a sweet-natured bombshell who employs Minny on the sly had also played Hilly As written and as acted heavily by Howard the storys key antagonist lacks the sort of specificity and detail that allows a caricature to become a character however loathsome. Even so ""The Help"" flits pleasingly from storyline to storyline. Just when you begin to grow itchy with Skeeters travails the script refocuses on Aibileen and the film transcends its well-intentioned limitations. Davis creates a whole character we care about and feel we know and she does so often by revealing as little as possible in tense situations with Aibileens employers. Do we believe every particular about Aibileen and Skeeter becoming sisters under the skin? Perhaps not. But we believe Davis every second and it has been a few months at least since good and great actresses have had the opportunity to relax into scenes given some breathing room. The movie is a very pretty and somewhat generic thing visually and it doesnt benefit from composer Thomas Newmans musical syrup. Those who are coming to ""The Help"" wanting a faithful but not slavish film adaptation wont care much about those issues. At an awards show a couple of years ago Meryl Streep said from the stage ""My God somebody give her a movie"" The ""her"" was Davis Streeps fellow ""Doubt"" Oscar nominee. Consider ""The Help"" featuring crafty supporting turns from Sissy Spacek and Allison Janney a well-crafted down payment on the movie Davis so clearly has in her. mjphillipstribune.com The Help -- 3 stars MPAA rating PG-13 (for thematic material) Cast Emma Stone (Skeeter); Viola Davis (Aibileen); Bryce Dallas Howard (Hilly); Octavia Spencer (Minny); Jessica Chastain (Celia); Allison Janney (Charlotte); Sissy Spacek (Missus Walters); Chris Lowell (Stuart) Credits Written and directed by Tate Taylor; based on the novel by Kathryn Stockett; produced by Brunson Green Chris Columbus and Michael Barnathan.

Stone is to borrow a phrase from Bret Easton Elliss Twitter account thoroughly post-empire--she doesnt need this kind of relic of old-school Hollywood to show off her chops. But this is the kind of thing The Help is best at forcing easy organic charm to glimmer through a few layers of ancient dust.A fast-talking eye-rolling snarler Stone wears a truly terrible perm to play the allegedly dowdy Skeeter a smart but naive recent college graduate who returns to her familys Mississippi plantation in the summer of 1962. She is shocked to discover that in her absence not only have her school friends become the casually cruelly racist white establishment but also her own beloved childhood maid (Cicely Tyson) has disappeared. Skeeter decides to write about her hometown from the perspective of the black women who work in every white household. Her ins to that world are Aibileen (Viola Davis) a dutiful maid who has a tendency to develop unusually intimate relationships with the white children shes paid to take care of (""Youre my real mama Abi"" a cherubic toddler cringe-worthily exclaims the second her bio-mom is out of earshot) and Minny (Octavia Spencer) whose inability to become wallpaper/doormat while at work has cost her a few jobs most recently and spectacularly in the home of the towns coolly despicable queen bee Hilly (Bryce Dallas Howard).The Help based on Kathryn Stocketts best-selling novel is so sincerely invested in the tenacity and nobility of Aibileen and Minny that to accuse writer/director Tate Taylor of pushing the dreaded Magical Negro button would be a low blow. These women are not merely the wisdom-spouting ciphers that so often exist as only devices to teach white movie characters lessons. They are that--they do actually say things like ""Fried chicken just tend to make you feel better bout life"" while pretty blond women look on beaming--but theyre not just that; theyre also victims of fairly realistic character flaws almost as much as theyre victims of circumstance.Skeeter of course has her own somewhat less urgent civil-rights battle signified by the fact that shes the only white woman in town with a job while her commitment to her career guarantees her inability to get and keep a boyfriend (a ""struggle"" still being fought in the average romantic comedy set today). Shes led to believe things are different in glam Manhattan but even her long-distance New York City mentor a short-skirted book editrix played by Mary Steenburgen is shown business-lunching with multiple men--and pointedly going to bed alone.Maybe its because her project is partially self-interested--shes not writing about these women to help only their careers--that Skeeter and the film neglect to sufficiently answer what is at one point posited as the book-within-the-movies key question Why do little white girls who are raised lovingly by black maids turn into raging racist assholes once theyve grown to run their own households?The psychology of this query is too complicated for a film so hell-bent on jerking easy tears and capturing a wide audience. Instead we get a fairly typical Hollywood flattening of history with powerful villains and disenfranchised heroes. In one corner there are contemptibly cowardly conformists like Hillys gang of girls and their seemingly interchangeable husbands. On the other side are outsiders of many stripes--the black servant class; Skeeter the unglam brainiac; and assorted white matron figures who seem to have the freedom to buck the norm only because theyve outlived their usefulness as women.As a filmmaker Taylor seems to be less interested in the stories of these working women than in the mechanics of storytelling--the ways in which reportage and gossip serve er separate but equal functions in shaping narratives. The Help is plainly a film about how talking becomes writing which becomes activism which turns into history. The night Medgar Evers is killed Aibileen tries to comfort a paranoid Minny ""We aint doin civil rights we just telling stories like they really happened""--a downplaying that rightfully makes her friend laugh. The characters are well aware of the portent of their story swapping as is the film. The Help is able to transcend its own puffed-up self-importance in only those few moments when two people on the margins--by choice or by birth--see their own struggles reflected in the other their individual hardships fading into a shared compulsion to fight back.

Dale Robinette Octavia Spencer right and Viola Davis are shown in a scene from ""The Help."" (AP Photo/Disney Dale Robinette) If the only thing that mattered in a movie were its good intentions then ""The Help"" would be ""The Greatest Story Ever Told."" But when an important message is delivered through cardboard cutouts its akin to a Tyler Perry production of ""Guess Whos Cooking the Dinner.""The novel by Kathryn Stockett and this film by her childhood friend Tate Taylor add an important perspective to our understanding of civil rights. In the Deep South a century after the end of slavery black maids functioned as surrogate mothers for well-to-do white children. Through the soft-focus lens of this crowd-pleasing comic drama all the maids are saintly or sassy while the employers range from racist to unrefined.The saint among saints is Aibileen (the wonderful Viola Davis) a 50-ish maid who says she has raised 17 children including one of her own. She is telling her story to Skeeter (Emma Stone strangely opaque) a young white would-be journalist in Jackson Miss. who has segued from a cleaning-advice column to a book about domestic servants. Skeeter also interviews Minnie (Octavia Spencer another standout) a talented cook who is fired by snooty employer Hilly (Bryce Dallas Howard making the most of a thankless role) for using the wrong bathroom. Minnie is opinionated and wants to get even with Hilly (in a plot twist that is literally hard to swallow) but like a maid who is caught stealing everything Minnie does is ostensibly justified by the behavior of evil whites of whom there are too many to count.What we dont see is a single working-class white character as if every Caucasian in Jackson were a member of a country club. (The one exception is Celia played for laughs by the amazing Jessica Chastain a feckless homemaker who is rich but is ostracized by Hillys bridge club for sexual impropriety.) Likewise the only black male who is not a preacher or a protester - Minnies abusive husband - is heard but not seen. On top of this stacked deck is a glazing of gloppy music to cue us when to cry or cheer. Its a credit to the cast and to the worthiness of the idea that this overlong movie works at all.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint The history of the civil rights movement is often told as a story of front-line battles between police and protesters stirring oratory and terrorist violence against citizens peacefully petitioning for redress of grievances. ""The Help"" is a poignant uplifting and sometimes hilarious dispatch from the domestic front. It tells the story of black maids in Jackson Miss. cleaning their white employers houses and raising their children under the shadow of Jim Crow laws that effectively define them as subhuman. This superb film based on Kathryn Stocketts 2009 runaway bestseller will trigger conspicuous Kleenex consumption and then having broken the viewers hearts carefully mend them. In Jackson in the early 1960s life is pleasant for the communitys white elite. The white-gloves-and-pearls Junior Leaguers throw luncheons without having to fill a coffee cup. These women organize cotillions that their black servants catered dress handsomely in outfits they ironed and drink cocktails on patios they swept. In return the towns good ladies pay their help enough to finance a shack and bus fare. They organize sanctimonious fundraisers for ""the poor starving children of Africa"" and provide their maids with separate-but-equal toilet facilities -- sweatbox latrines in the garage. To them the idea of a white family and its black help sharing in-house bathrooms is a horror beyond contemplation. It never occurs to them that the people they consider appliances might be as good as (and perhaps better than) they are. The superlative Viola Davis a supporting actress Oscar nominee for ""Doubt"" gets her first-ever headlining role in a stellar cast including Emma Stone Bryce Dallas Howard Jessica Chastain Allison Janney Sissy Spacek and Cicely Tyson. Davis plays Aibileen a soft-spoken dignified maid who loves the white children in her care like a mother. Aibileen had no economic advantages and limited education; nevertheless shes a woman of quiet wisdom and substance. She finds camaraderie with her feisty friend Minny (Octavia Spencer a fireball of madcap comic energy) and comfort in tending children but laments never having enough time for her own son. At the dawn of the civil rights era naive newly minted Ole Miss grad Skeeter Phelan (Stone) returns to Jackson in hopes of launching a journalism career (another quaint period touch in this handsomely detailed retro production). She lands a job writing the cleaning advice column for the local paper. Never having scrubbed a pot she turns to Aibileen for guidance. Gradually she realizes that the domestic servants with their own untold stories and insights into every affluent familys dirty laundry could be her ticket to a book deal. She begins interviewing the maids for her tell-all obscuring the details a bit to protect her sources from reprisal. Shes decent and sympathetic to Aibileens plight but no ""freedom now"" revolutionary. Skeeter helps others as a means of helping herself true empathy arriving afterward when she realizes how much the maids who trust her to chronicle their stories have risked. ""The Help"" avoids the trap of recasting a story of black struggle into the story of a white savior. Dale Robinette Mct - Mct Viola Davis right stars in ""The Help"" with Emma Stone left and Octavia Spencer. Through the maids stories we learn the petty tyrannies of vain racist society women. The worst of the lot is Miss Hilly (Howard) a wasp queen whose icy condescension and lemon-slice smile demean her servants at every turn. Observing all from a wry distance is Skeeters mother (Janney) who considers marrying off her 23-year-old spinster the worlds most urgent business. ""Your eggs are dying"" she scolds. ""Would it kill you to go on a date?"" Stocketts book gave some attention to the political underpinnings of Mississippi racism. Its one of the few failings of director/screenwriter Tate Taylors sturdy adaptation that the larger context of the drama plays so small a part. We briefly glimpse news of martyred activists on black-and-white TVs but the most important social advance in 20th-century America is seen largely through a domestic keyhole. It wasnt all mean girls and good girls. Still in this season of robots aliens and superheroes ""The Help"" is a blue-ribbon achievement. It has a mature appreciation of human truth. Late in the film Skeeter grows to understand the role that her own familys black housekeeper played in making her the woman she became able to reach across barriers of class and race to write honestly about her regions troubled legacy. The film could have ended there; wisely it continues. The bittersweet coda belongs to Davis as Aibileen moving toward an uncertain future with her head held high.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Three summers ago I went to visit a friend in West Texas. She took a group of us to a restaurant in a big well-appointed country house. At some point during the meal one of us saw something alarming. A ceramic statue of a squat black woman was propping open a door. It was the sort of figurine that sums up a particular strain of race in America. The owner was a tall white woman who looked 50 in a very young way. When I asked her about the statue her face lit up. ""Oh mammy she said. ""Isnt she wonderful?I dont know what kind of racist craziness we expected her to express but that wasnt it. I was the lone black person in our group which also included only one native Southerner and as a confrontation brewed between this woman and the young people in her restaurant I watched her defiance turn into something else. ""Mammy is strong she kept saying. ""Mammy raised me. We saw a loaded insult. She saw an emblem of welcoming. We were mad. And our anger broke her heart.This pretty much captures the cognitive dissonance of watching ""The Help One womans mammy is anothers mans mother. What can you do? Its possible both to like this movie - to let it crack you up then make you cry - and to wonder why we need a broad if sincere dramatic comedy about black maids in Jackson Miss. in 1962 and 63 and the high-strung white housewives they work for. The movie is too pious for farce and too eager to please to comment persuasively on the racial horrors of the Deep South at that time.Ads mostly feature the white actors in various tizzies using accents wide as a boulevard. Its ""Tin Magnolias. Meanwhile the heart of the film itself belongs to Aibileen Clark (Viola Davis) and Minny Jackson (Octavia Spencer) the two very different maids and best friends at the center of the story. Aibileen is stoic. Minny is defiant. But the movie like the extremely popular Kathryn Stockett novel its based on uses the civil rights movement to suggest that the help could use some help. And so a young white woman named Skeeter Phelan (Emma Stone) finds herself writing a controversial book in the words of the maids who work in the homes of her girlfriends.The movie wants us to know that both sets of women are in tough spots. When Skeeters friend and the films queen bee Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard) insists that a separate bathroom for the maids enhances the value of ones house it also puts social pressure on women like Skeeter and Hillys former classmate Elizabeth Leefolt (Ahna OReilly) who employs Aibileen to build one. Meanwhile the maids who talk anonymously to Skeeter in Aibileens little shack dont want to lose their jobs for doing so. Jackson is a small enough place that when Minny does something entertainingly awful to Hilly and loses her job working for Hillys dithering mother (Sissy Spacek) she has to sneak a job on Jacksons outskirts working for Celia (Jessica Chastain) a five-and-dime Marilyn Monroe whos thrilled that skeptical Minny actually wants the job of maintaining her enormous house.Skeeters expose is meant to empower both the subjects and the author but ""The Help joins everything from ""To Kill a Mockingbird to ""The Blind Side as another Hollywood movie that sees racial progress as the province of white do-gooderism. Skeeter enjoys all the self-discovery and all the credit. She cracks the mystery of her missing childhood maid (Cicely Tyson). She finds a career at a moment in which women rarely had them. And she changes the lives of a couple of dozen black women whose change is refracted primarily through her. Skeeters awakening is a seemingly risk-free reassurance just as Hillys Hanna-Barbera villainy is a kind of delight. The meaner she gets the bigger and higher her hair goes.The novel made a lot of people feel good. It was sneaky. Stockett wrote tolerably in Aibileen and Minnys voices - in a way that keeps black vernacular inside dignified English and avoids the literary dehumanization that Toni Morrison has written about. But as much as the book was about race and class it was really about how feminism empowered Skeeter and Stockett to address other injustices.Tate Taylor a childhood friend of Stockett adapted and directed the movie. He applies a thick coat of gloss to most scenes. Its hard not to imagine what trouble the passive largely absent husbands of these bigoted women are up to off-screen. The death of the civil rights activist Medgar Evers is reported on television so white supremacy is in the air but the movie would have us believe that the racism of the time was the stuff of bridge clubs. Indeed the meanest male in the movie is the abusive mostly unseen black husband who in a poorly made sequence comes after Minny.Taylor opts for vibrancy. He encourages every actors performance to take up as much room in a scene as it can. Allison Janney plays Skeeters self-conscious marriage-obsessed mother and she comes as close to ""Mamas Family as one can get without being Vicki Lawrence or Carol Burnett. Playing to the back of the house works better for Chastain whose breathy dingbat is a universe away from the beatific mother she played in ""The Tree of Life. She and Spencer create great comedy out of the social science fiction of their relationship and their scenes are the best in the movie. Weve never seen this before two stereotypes forging new human ground together. Minny shows Celia she can be a good wife and Chastains surprise is like a joke whose punch line youre happy to keep forgetting.Davis goes the opposite direction. Shes a character actor lost in another role. This one is tough. Shes asked to be serious and thoughtful amid assorted offenses. But you can tell its the back story of Aibileens murdered college-bound son shes clinging to. It was an inspired idea to give her gold caps and show her once without her wig. Few women keep a movie tethered to earth just by folding their hands and staring at another actor. Her touch is soft though. She could pin a corsage on you with a sword.And yet heres the question you ask as you watch a black actor in 2011 play a white ladys maid decades and decades after that was the only job a black woman in Hollywood could get. What went through the minds of Davis Spencer and Aunjanue Ellis who plays Hillys maid as they put on those uniforms and went to work? What went through the minds of the extras? A movie now about black maids in the 1960s can try to reconfigure all black maids in the movies. But its an uphill climb that only the playwright Lynn Nottage has even come close to managing.""The Help comes out on the losing end of the movies social history. The best film roles three black women will have all year require one of them to clean Ron Howards daughters house. Its self-reinforcing movie imagery. White boys have always been Captain America. Black women in one way or another have always been someones maid. These are strong figures as that restaurant owner might sincerely say but couldnt they be strong doing something else? Thats the hardest thing to reconcile about Skeeters book and ""The Help in general. On one hand its juicy heartwarming well-meant entertainment. On the other its an owners manual.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. Follow him at www.twitter.com/wesley_morris. (c) Copyright 2011 Globe Newspaper Company.

"The Help review A showcase for actresses -- and a slightly skewed history lesson |       NJ.com comments The Help review A showcase for actresses -- and a slightly skewed history lesson Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on August 09 2011 at 813 AM updated August 09 2011 at 1236 PM View/Post Comments DreamWorksFrom left Emma Stone Octavia Spencer and Viola Davis in ""The Help."" There is an African-American saying that in the North white people let you rise high just as long as you dont get close; in the South white people let you get close as long as you dont rise high. ""The Help"" set in early 60s Mississippi shows just how close -- and yet separate -- side-by-side lives could be. Based on the best-seller by Kathryn Stockett its the story of Eugenia ""Skeeter"" Phelan a budding journalist in Jackson doing a study of all the black housekeepers who keep all those nice white ladies looking so cool and rested. And what the housekeepers have to tell her becomes nothing less than a story of civil rights and moral wrongs. When it was published in 2009 Stocketts novel drew some criticism for giving the white Skeeter such a prominent role -- as if the story of her awakening to injustice were as important as the injustice itself. That focus only sharpens here Hollywood still prefers using a member of the majority as the entry point into any minoritys story. Skeeter is played by Emma Stone though who is genuinely engaging and when necessary enraged. With her quicksilver features shes able to pass for both a pudding-faced high-schooler at one point and a sophisticated Southern belle at another. And its still the black actresses who own this -- as they should -- and help lift it above well-intentioned melodrama. The extraordinary Viola Davis is breathtaking as Aibileen who has tenderly raised 30 years worth of white children yet never had time for her own life. ""Doubt"" won her one Oscar nomination; this performance deserves another. And Octavia Spencer -- her huge wide-set eyes always set in an expression of startled outrage -- is a consistent delight as Minny the determinedly independent maid who inevitably stands up to her white bosses (but cant seem to leave her abusive husband). For audiences starved for strong female roles this movie gives us plenty (including the always-welcome Sissy Spacek as a slightly dotty matron). For audiences interested in the era however the movie provides some dubious details. Its unlikely for example that Minnies amazing act of rebellion would go unpunished in those Klan-ridden times. And the scenes of maids looking back longingly to the 30s -- when white bosses knew how to act -- feels more like the author fantasizing than the characters talking. Blame that perhaps on fledgling director and screenwriter Tate Taylor who happens to be one of Stocketts close friends. Better than a friend here would have been a fresh eye -- perhaps someone like Kasi Lemmons who might have had her own insights to add. Because while ""The Help"" is wholly entertaining you never get the sense its telling you the whole story. What it does tell you though is still startling -- and what it does show you when we finally sit down in the kitchen with these tired but indomitable women is still provocative as it asks hard questions about class and color and child care. And if you dont think those topics are still worth pondering just look around any playground some morning. Ratings note The film contains violence strong language alcohol abuse and one very scatological joke. The Help (PG-13) Touchstone (137 min.) Directed by Tate Taylor.

The Help Fair to good Director Tate Taylor. Cast Emma Stone Viola Davis Octavia Spencer. Rating Rated PG-13 for thematic material. This weeks new movie releases Based on bestsellers Tate Taylor wrote the screenplay and directs the film based on Kathryn Stocketts popular novel and does so lovingly. The acting is uniformly excellent and the cause - dragging the beginnings of civil rights into Jackson Miss. at great risk - couldnt be nobler. Writer and director bond over The Help What the film lacks is a strong point of view. The story is all over the place on that front bouncing from one perspective to another. That can work well in a novel but not so much in a movie. Also and this may be unfair but it is still evident ""The Help"" carries a little hint of the Great White Savior about it. This doesnt ruin the film by any means but it also cant be ignored. Skeeter Phelan (Emma Stone) has just graduated from college in Mississippi in the 1960s and returned home. The town is divided Black and White and nowhere is this more evident than in Skeeters social circle young women married as soon as possible raising children - or more accurately having their children raised by the Black women who work for them. One of these women is Aibileen Clark (Viola Davis) and the film begins from her point of view talking about the irony of raising babies who grow up to have babies of their own - and quickly forget who brought them up. The racism among the moneyed White women is so ingrained as to be casual which can sometimes be its most hurtful form. It never occurs to Skeeters friend Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard) not to treat ""the help"" dismissively because to her thats all they are - help there to assist her in whatever she needs. She certainly has no regard for them as peers; she barely has regard for them as people. One of her society ""issues"" is to pass a law requiring White homes with Black maids and nannies to build a separate bathroom. Skeeter is different though not unaffected - the Black woman who raised her is gone and her mother (Allison Janney) wont give her a straight answer about what happened to her. Skeeter wants to be a serious writer and a New York editor (Mary Steenburgen) needs something to judge her on. So Skeeter having gotten a job at the local newspaper writing a housecleaning column asks Clark for help with tips. But what she really wants is to know how the ""help"" is treated about the world from their perspective for a book. Aibileen is afraid. She knows if it becomes clear who she is she will be fired if not worse. Probably worse. Yet she is also a proud woman and enough is enough. She decides to go through with the project. She also tries to convince Minny (Octavia Spencer) to talk. Minny is sassy taking no guff from her employers which explains why shes had so many. Shes also not shy about revenge something Hilly will learn all too clearly as will the readers of Skeeters book eventually. Her participation along with some seminal events in the Civil Rights movement leads others to talk as well. The performances are outstanding. Stone continues to star in seemingly every other movie out this summer and its nice to see her in a drama though frankly at times Skeeter seems a little like a lightweight. Davis is anything but giving Aibileen a dignity that characters like Hilly would never recognize nor understand. Spencer is also quite good though her role is more of the stock sassy heavy Black woman weve seen in many other films. This doesnt mean shes not good at it; she is. Just that its not a particularly original character. Howards may be the best performance in the film. The cruelty of Hillys disregard for the women who raised her who raise her children who make her life possible is stunning. And Howard never backs off of that cruelty an inch. She is spoiled privileged reprehensible and Howard nails every characteristic without flinching. Her performance along with that of Davis lends a heft to the film it otherwise would have lacked. ""The Help"" benefits from that greatly. It would have benefited even more from a stronger focus to give it the jolt of power it could use. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Daily Edition Login to download The Help Film Review 1201 AM PDT 8/7/2011 by Kirk Honeycutt FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS This self-conscious and self-congratulatory portrait of the Jim Crow South does at least contain two magnificent award-worthy performances by Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer. TWITTER Actresses Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer dominate Tate Taylors adaptation of Kathryn Stocketts civil-rights era novel about Southern maids and their testy relationships with white female employers. In his first major studio production The Help writer-director Tate Taylor enters a minefield of sociological historical and artistic booby traps. The setting is 1963 Jackson Mississippi where racial tensions simmer between African-American maids and their white employers at the dawn of the civil rights movement. Through cruel words and haughty gestures privileged white women communicate disdain for their black help while the maids seethe at the casual insults delivered almost daily. Taylor does capture the Jim Crow era and its anxieties well but his characters tend toward the facile and his white heroine is too idealized. The film also seems as if it were made in a void of cinematic ignorance as if no motion picture of that or any other era ever tackled this topic. Consequently there is almost nothing new here that filmmakers novelists and historians havent picked over years ago. Indeed Jackson Mississippi along with Selma Alabama is still struggling to overcome being a geographic byword for Southern resistance to civil rights and human dignity. Where The Help succeeds magnificently though is in character portraits by actresses Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer. They play maids who agree to tell their stories to a young white journalist ""Skeeter"" Phelan (Emma Stone) who means to write a book to demonstrate that racism doesnt just mean denial of education and voting rights. Davis Aibileen Clark is the epitome of deferential politeness with a ""mam"" at the end of every utterance. Yet her eyes speak volumes about the pain and anger she feels. She embodies the strange contradiction experienced by many a black maid or nanny who suffers abuse at the hands of white employers yet has lavished boundless love and devotion on the 17 white children she has raised. However bitterness has crept into her soul since the death of her beloved son. Meanwhile Spencers scrappy Minny Jackson Aibileens best friend and the best cook in the county provides not only comic relief but a feistiness that shows that some maids found the gumption andmeans to get back at overbearing employers. Hers is a great character the antithesis of Gone With the Winds Mammy and she nearly upends this movie with her righteous sass. VIDEO Emma Stone in The Help Trailer The film based on a novel by Kathryn Stockett takes place in the world of Southern women. The white men may rule the world but not their own households so they are deliberately marginalized here. The chauvinism they display toward their wives or girlfriends sets up a chain reaction where the white women take their own insecurities and inadequacies out on the black help. This is all well and good up to a point but Taylor verges uncomfortably into cliche when he insists all wisdom and long-suffering nobility resides within the black nannies while the Southern belles of the country-club set are either witches such as Bryce Dallas Howards impossibly villainous Hilly Holbrook or weak-minded go-alongers such as Allison Janneys Charlotte Phelan Skeeters mother who cannot stand up to Hillys bullying. Another female character who starts off like a cliche Jessica Chastains dumb blonde Celia Foote blossoms into an accidental heroine a social outsider in Jackson whose homemaking conspiracies with maid Minny demonstrate that some white Southerners were color-blind even then. Ditto that for Sissy Spaceks dotty hard drinking old lady although at times she seems like a refugee from a minor Tennessee Williams play. Which leaves the problem of the films actual protagonist. With a name like Skeeter you can expect this 22-year-old to be a rebel and troublemaker. Nothing accounts for her color-blindness other that she is right-minded --and a writer. For naturally a novelist would assume a fellow writer is above such pettiness as racism and class snobbery. Stone is one of our very best young actresses and she acquits herself well in this role. She makes you imagine that this might be how Scout from Harper Lees To Kill a Mockingbird might have turned out had she become a journalist Too inquisitive sensitive and empathetic not to brush aside the common wisdom of the day to see eternal truths about human beings. There are small moments in the film though that make you long for a movie that is not so deep-dish serious and self-conscious a contemporary movie that could take advantage of the viewpoint of a half century to look at the past with a kind of cock-eyed grace such as Todd Haynes Far From Heaven or even the TV series Mad Men. These moments come when you see a maid absurdly vacuuming a large stuffed bear or when one opines ""Love and hate are two horns on the same goat."" Now thats the spirit But no the film falls too much in love with its vintage cars period hairdos quaint customs and ubiquitous cigarettes. It lingers a tad too long on the Colored Only signs and Confederate flags. It makes its points with set design and camera movements rather than fully explore the never-ending puzzlement of human malice and ignorance.

A stirring black-empowerment tale aimed squarely at white auds ""The Help"" personalizes the civil rights movement through the testimony of domestic servants working in Jackson Miss. circa 1963. But more than that it serves as an enlightening and deeply affecting exercise in empathy for those whove never considered what life must have been like for African-Americans living with inequality a full century after the Emancipation Proclamation called an end to slavery. With its Southern sass and feel-good sensitivity -- and broad awareness as a New York Times bestseller -- ""The Help"" should clean up domestically though it may not translate well overseas. Based on Kathryn Stocketts unlikely chart-topper in which a white girl who fancies herself a writer convinces more than a dozen Mississippi maids to publish their stories the adaptation is a multiethnic ensembler with likely greater appeal among genteel white ladies than the black community it somewhat patronizingly seeks to understand. The eminently likable Emma Stone plays the young journalist a misfit debutante-turned-college grad named Skeeter Phelan though the true hero is Viola Davis Aibileen the African-American maid who puts her life and career on the line; in the Jim Crow South talking out of turn could get Aibileen lynched. The pair make compelling leads in a film packed with strong female characters. Getting to know this colorful and diverse group of ladies is chief among ""The Helps"" many pleasures as the film emphasizes hankie-tugging sisterhood over pricklier issues that continue to divide the races today. Standouts include Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard) and Celia Foote (Jessica Chastain) two white ladies from opposite ends of the social spectrum. Even though the actresses playing them look uncannily similar they create radically different portraits of Southern eccentricity. As president of the local Junior League Hilly is the classy Marilyn to Celias trailer-trash Norma Jean; both women also happen to share a maid the cantankerous and equally unforgettable Minny Jackson (Octavia Spencer) who isnt afraid to burn bridges in order to preserve her self-respect. Everyone whos anyone in Jackson -- from Skeeters imperious mother (Allison Janney perfectly cast) to Aibileens boss Elizabeth Leefolt (Ahna OReilly a master of the insincere Southern smile-scowl) -- allows Hilly to bully them around. Top of her agenda is passing a bill that would require employers to build separate outdoor bathrooms for the help. Thanks to Minny shell get her just desserts courtesy of a twist that rivals that of kindred spirit ""Fried Green Tomatoes."" In the novel Skeeters anonymously published expose is simply called ""Help"" -- a clever play on words that suggests a cry for change from segregated second-class citizens desperate for their voices to be heard. The film adapted with the sure hand of a seasoned pro by Stocketts longtime friend Tate Taylor (a relatively unproven director with only one previous feature to his name 2008s ""Pretty Ugly People"") hews relatively close to its source material running a tad on the long side in order to squeeze in most of the personality-rich books characters and subplots. Still many of these elements are paid little more than passing recognition and might have been better omitted altogether if only to leave more room for the maids. Though the film makes Hillys Home Help Sanitation Initiative (like her use of the N-word) unreasonable enough that no one would hesitate to denounce it today the issue cuts to the heart of Stocketts strong central theme In their own minds many Southern whites viewed their servants as members of the family and yet they seldom extended them the same courtesies they would have shown to even the most unwanted relative. To underscore the point Stockett includes Hillys mother Missus Walters (Sissy Spacek) whose Alzheimers hasnt advanced enough to erase the memory of her daughters most embarrassing secret. In 1960s Mississippi the only thing the white society ladies value more than discretion is gossip and Skeeters book threatens to expose all their dirty laundry. Even more entertaining than the dirt is the dramatic story behind the books creation intercut with such actual events as the assassination of Medgar Evers which positions the publication of the fictitious tome as one of those inspiring small steps/giant leaps in which white readers come to recognize their fellow man. The film itself shares that perspective frequently privileging the maids point of view to the extent that Taylor opens and closes the film with Aibileens testimony to Skeeters question ""Whats it feel like raising a white child when your own child is at home being raised by someone else?"" Like Stockett Taylor grew up in Jackson and demonstrates a keen wryly observant sense for the dialect and mannerisms of his hometown. Despite his limited directing experience the helmer has firm control of the material working with production designer Mark Ricker (""Julie amp; Julia"") and costume designer Sharen Davis (""Dreamgirls"") to create a robust fully saturated snapshot of the city from Hillys impeccable beehive hairdo to Aibileens understated-yet-proud living room. ""The Help"" probably didnt need the anemic romantic thread between Skeeter and Stuart Whitworth (Chris Lowell) though its inclusion -- over the books explanation for what really happened to Constantine (Cicely Tyson) the Phelan family maid who lost her job after her daughter was born pale enough to pass for white -- suggests where the films priorities lie. Its a shame too that the pic leaves out the particulars of what happens to Aibileen though the final scene -- in concert with Thomas Newmans score throughout -- is irrefutably optimistic about where things are headed.
