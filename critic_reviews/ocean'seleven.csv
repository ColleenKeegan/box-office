An all-star remake of the all-star original ""Oceans Eleven"" is a lark for everybody concerned including the audience. Breezy nonchalant and without a thing on its mind except having a little fun this lightweight caper doesnt take itself seriously and hardly expects the viewer to do so either which itself sets it apart from any other mainstream film Steven Soderbergh has ever made. Watching George Clooney compete with Andy Garcia for Julia Roberts while plotting with Brad Pitt Matt Damon and some other good-looking guys to knock over a Las Vegas casino vault will sound like a pretty good deal to most of the moviegoing public meaning that Warner Bros. will be making some happy trips of its own to a vault wads of cash in hand. Legendary after a fashion as the film that put the Rat Pack together on the bigscreen for the first time and in a Vegas setting no less the 1960 production is remarkable for nothing other than its cast. It is in fact an amazingly lazy and lax piece of work one in which you often feel that it was all director Lewis Milestone could do to get the guys in front of the camera at the same time to say their lines. Watchable up to a point for the ethos it evokes and historical moment it represents lethargic pic has no intrinsic credibility or suspense. Although they cant begin to be compared iconographically to Frank Dean Sammy and the rest the stars are the main event here as well. In this day of 20 million players its rare to see an Irwin Allen-sized lineup of several bona fide movie stars in the same picture but Clooney and Soderbergh made it happen and its a mild treat to watch the thesps good-naturedly bouncing off one another no matter how inconsequential the material. Even more amusing is observing two seasoned old pros Carl Reiner and Elliott Gould devilishly stealing every scene theyre in from their more glamorous cohorts. A good part of the fun in this kind of picture derives from the masterminds rounding up his crew each one a specialist in a certain area that will prove critical to the success of the job. Such is the case here as the debonair Danny Ocean (Clooney) is no sooner released from a four-year stretch in the pen than he begins approaching his key personnel. In Atlantic City he recruits casino dealer and fellow ex-con Frank Catton (the instantly winning Bernie Mac); in Hollywood he recruits card sharp Rusty Ryan (Pitt in Steve McQueen mode) who needs a challenge; in Chicago he finds Linus Caldwell (Damon) son of a legendary con man; in Florida he locates elderly down-on-his-luck hustler Saul Bloom (Reiner) and in Vegas he successfully pitches his plan to bejeweled moneybags Reuben Tishkoff (Gould) a former hotel and casino tycoon who has been deposed by the new king of Vegas Terry Benedict (Garcia). The plot is outlandish seemingly impossible To rob the vault located 200 feet underground that holds the cash that covers all the chips in play at the three hotel casinos -- the Bellagio the Mirage and the MGM Grand -- owned by Benedict. On the night in question when a heavyweight championship fight will bring plenty of high rollers into town the holdings are expected to amount to 150 million. How the heist will be pulled off is another question one the silky-smooth Danny makes sound complicated but feasible. To manage it he calls in the remainder of his team A Cockney demolition wizard (Don Cheadle curiously unbilled onscreen but included in the press notes) whose task it will be to shut down electrical power in Vegas at a precise time; a sweaty surveillance man (Eddie Jemison); disguise-happy drivers and delivery twins (Casey Affleck Scott Caan) and ""grease man"" Yen (Shaobo Qin) a Chinese acrobat whose unusual ability to fold himself in half at the waist and fit into tiny containers qualifies him as an important cog in the wheel. Then theres the part Danny doesnt bother to mention Terry Benedicts personal art curator and girlfriend Tess (Roberts) happens to be Dannys ex-wife and he wants her back. When Tess makes her first entrance 45 minutes into the action its clear that the feeling isnt mutual. And when Rusty learns that the motivation for the job is personal not purely professional hes briefly so upset that he wants Danny out of the picture as well. But Danny perseveres knowing that his only chance with Tess lies in his getting the better of the seemingly invincible Benedict. Since virtually the entire narrative in Ted Griffins script is procedural in that every scene is in some way related to the eventual execution of the robbery its somewhat surprising that Soderbergh puts so little effort into building up excitement in the heist itself. But then again from ""Rififi"" on this has been done a hundred times so the director perhaps rightly decided not to try to inflate with bogus suspense a sequence that if presented with alleged realism might have been exposed as more preposterously far-fetched than it already seems. Suffice it to say that this film does not present criminals with any ideas they could easily put into practice. No the film is all about surfaces and behavior and grace notes. Working as his own cinematographer under the nom de camera of Peter Andrews as he did on ""Traffic"" Soderbergh bathes his actors and settings in a flattering warm glow but retains a measure of the rough-and-ready visual style he developed on his last picture. Steering clear of traditional Hollywood glamour photography despite the obvious temptations helmer attractively frames the beautiful faces and luxurious surroundings (the production had virtually free rein at the Bellagio for weeks) in images of moderate textural grain giving the film a grittier look than usual for this sort of extravaganza. Much of the film is about pretending and about getting away with something. This applies to dapper Danny of course and Clooney has no problem making him the cool and commanding figure the others are willing to follow into what looks like a foolhardy adventure. But the greatest ""actor"" here is Bloom who literally has to shed his old-Jewish-two-bit-dog-track-habitue skin to become a gravely fastidious billionaire of indeterminate origin in order to worm his way into Benedicts exclusive circle. Fretting inside and battling poor health Bloom is made into a choice creation by Reiner making one wish the character could have been given even more screen time. Same can be said of Tishkoff with Goulds wonderful and surprising delineation of a flamboyant but non-caricatured old school queen prompting speculation that the vet thesps range has been decidedly untested. Entire cast seems spontaneous and relaxed. She has more to do than Angie Dickinson did in the original but Roberts is still basically The Girl here albeit one very much worth fighting over and bedecked with fabulous clothes and jewels. Pic could have used a more formidable adversary than Garcias Benedict who is very much the slick entrepreneurial parvenu; with someone like Robert De Niro in the role the entire enterprise would have taken on some welcome weight without at all throwing off the fun dynamic. David Holmes score is characterized by a frisky jazzy feel that is at times abetted by other musical moods notably that of Debussys ""Clair de lune."" Original pic is repped by Dickinson and Henry Silva who fleetingly appear in the crowd for the Lennox Lewis-Wladimir Klitschko prizefight that occurs the night of the robbery. Films coyest touch comes in the end credits which list all the male players and then conclude with ""...and introducing Julia Roberts as Tess.""

"USATODAY.com - Oceans Eleven drifts far away Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 12/07/2001 - Updated 0941 AM ET Oceans Eleven drifts far away By Mike Clark USA TODAY Oceans Eleven (out of four) Stars George Clooney Brad Pitt Matt Damon Julia Roberts Andy Garcia Don Cheadle Bernie Mac Carl Reiner Director Steven Soderbergh Distributor Warner Bros. Rating PG-13 for some language and sexual content The hip factor is missing in Steven Soderberghs more tightly crafted Oceans Eleven reworking which is fatally lighter on the two Vs -- vermouth and Vegas mystique -- that still make 1960s Rat Pack original waningly watchable. As lead George Clooney recently told Katie Couric on NBCs Today ""the truth is those guys (Frank Sinatra Dean Martin Sammy Davis Jr. Peter Lawford Joey Bishop) youd watch them drink coffee thats the truth."" OK it was rarely coffee but the point is well taken. Read more Photo gallery Oceans Eleven Return of the Rat Pack Stories An interview with Las Vegas coolest cut-ups How then compares with now This is a lot to ask Clooney Brad Pitt Matt Damon and Julia Roberts to replicate when they werent a) appearing nightly to sold-out houses at the Sands during filming or b) beginning to help a president (Lawfords brother-in-law John F. Kennedy) get elected. And without an equivalent aura were left with the millionth caper movie since Sinatra amp; Co. -- cast as unlikely 82nd Airborne war buddies -- robbed five Las Vegas casinos 41 years ago. Despite dashes of droll dialogue from screenwriter Ted Griffin the remake aims for cool but instead gets chilly. Its not a stretch to call it surprisingly glum given the joking around key cast members have displayed including during the Nov. 16 group interview with Barbara Walters. This isnt to say that Roberts was desecrating a classic when she told USA TODAY that she tried watching the original but fell asleep twice. With Sinatras performance more aloof than anything in either version youll see -- when it comes out on DVD Jan. 8 -- that the first film takes about 45 minutes to register a pulse. It finally does (a little) -- but thanks to elements that have no parallels in the new movie. Martins repeated Aint That a Kick in the Head vocals nonsensical cameos by Shirley MacLaine and Red Skelton plus vital supporting performances from Cesar Romero and Ilka Chase manage to make Las Vegas look and feel festive which ought to be a major ambition of any big-star Sin City caper pic. The original is swathed in party-time legend. The new version ends up being about banal technology How will a motley crew of specialists and ex-cons (no war heroes these guys) break into a state-of-the-art impenetrable vault? Years go by and security systems improve but those same damned booty-protective laser beams that movie crooks must outwit remain vexing. Yes they were definitely cool and novel in 1966s Gambit and How to Steal a Million -- movies released so long ago that Dino hits were still charting. Its also worth noting that the casino-heist premise wasnt totally fresh in 1960. In 1955s 5 Against the House (Kim Novaks third movie) some aging college guys on the GI Bill knocked off a Nevada betting joint though it took place in another gambling bastion Reno. That screen caper ended as disastrously as the one in Eleven which means that two earlier variations with the same blueprint have punchier wrap-ups than the negligible resolution we get from Soderbergh and Griffin. (The writers 1999 cannibal-Western Ravenous was at least outrageous.) Obviously Eleven is forced to scuttle the originals basic premise -- that World War II heroes without criminal records could not be obvious suspects. This time Clooneys Danny Ocean (same moniker as Frank Sinatras) is getting out of the clink in the first scene so there goes that plot point right off. In fact the owner (Andy Garcia) of the three targeted casinos suspects him almost at once but cant prove the accusation. Garcia is rightfully wary because hes involved with Clooneys ex-wife (Roberts) which is at the root of the movies undoing. In the original we dont witness any heat between Sinatra and his own estranged missus (Angie Dickinson) but their one scene together is a throwaway early on. In the new version Clooney wants to foil Garcia because hes still pining for his ex yet we never believe it. Clooney still cant convey longing or any other kind of emotional depth on-screen and in a movie first Roberts looks wan and tired in her limited scenes. The new film has a few compensations. Its 11 minutes shorter than the original and so coldly cut to the bone that it doesnt ramble. As Clooneys cardsharp buddy Pitt trades some decent ""gotcha"" lines before his role mostly disappears in Hour 2. As an aged retiree brought in on the caper Carl Reiner has his meatiest screen role ever -- reward perhaps for being the greatest straight man of all time (to Sid Caesar and Mel Brooks) next to Dean Martin. But all you need do to gauge this new installments disappointment factor is to study some recent credits. Soderbergh was previously on a staggering four-movie dice roll with Out of Sight The Limey Erin Brockovich and Traffic. The first was a superb ensemble/Clooney caper movie the second has a monster cult the third won an Oscar for Roberts and the last won an Oscar for Soderbergh. To ape the title of a dandy 1960 Dino album This Time Im Swingin this time theyre slumming.

Starring George Clooney Brad Pitt Matt Damon Andy Garcia and Julia Roberts. Directed by Steven Soderbergh. (VHS and DVD. PG-13. 105 minutes.) ""Oceans Eleven"" is based on the old Rat Pack movie starring Frank Sinatra and his pals but the new movie doesnt have that Rat Pack ring-a-ding-ding. Theres no joy and little playfulness about this caper comedy which despite a lighthearted script has a sober undertone to it almost a melancholia. Steven Soderbergh is a director who makes only intelligent films and although it would be too much to say that ""Oceans Eleven"" might have been better off with an idiot as director he is definitely an odd match for this material. Fortunately his artistic intelligence keeps him from suffocating all the life out of ""Oceans Eleven"" which buzzes along at a mildly entertaining pitch from start to finish. For actors George Clooney Brad Pitt and company this is a chance to match themselves against an earlier model of manhood and the new guys stack up quite nicely. We first see Clooney as a graying scraggly-looking prisoner. A minute later hes out of jail. His hair has been cut and dyed and hes breezing into a casino. Clooney is Danny Ocean a man with a plan to rob the central safe for three Las Vegas casinos. He hooks up with an old pal Rusty (Pitt) and puts together a dream team of crooks and con men. Danny is interested in robbing these casinos in particular because theyre owned by Benedict (Andy Garcia) a ruthless billionaire who is romancing Oceans ex-wife Tess. In an example of casting clout gone awry Soderbergh casts Julia Roberts as Tess and she tanks every scene shes in with her sour self-righteous performance. The good news is that shes not in many scenes. ""Oceans Eleven"" is filled with slick storytelling touches. And Soderbergh indulges in a nice silent-movie effect near the finish in which Debussys ""Clair de Lune"" underscores an entire sequence. One could question what Debussy has to do with Las Vegas or for that matter what Soderberghs approach has to do with ""Oceans Eleven."" But in the end everyone comes out of Vegas a little bit ahead.

But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

Smart sassy and gleefully meaningless this caper flick directed by Steven Soderbergh and starring George Clooney Brad Pitt Matt Damon and Julia Roberts -- among others -- is quite simply a hoot. A remake of the 1960 Rat Pack flick of the same name ""Oceans Eleven"" is a far better film then the original. Frank Sinatra and his gang didnt really intend to make a good movie; they were just hanging out and it showed. Now in the hands of Soderbergh and his own pack of all-stars its still just a piece of fluff but a well-done piece of fluff. The film opens with con man extraordinaire Danny Ocean (Clooney) being released from prison. Rather then mending his ways he immediately contacts cardsharp Rusty Ryan (Pitt) with a proposal. Ocean plans on recruiting the creme de la creme of grifters and involving them in a scheme to rob three Las Vegas casinos at the same time hauling in a cool 150 million.

Posted December 5 2001 -- 1200 AM EST In Oceans Eleven the director Steven Soderbergh stages some of the cheekiest and also the most elegantly complicated tricks ever seen in a heist film and hes in such relaxed exhilarated command of his medium that he barely works up a sweat. He appears to be having the time of his life and so does everyone in the cast; so I suspect will the audience. ""Oceans Eleven"" has no pretenses yet its a scrumptious and dizzy-spirited lark a what-the-hell-lets-rob-the-casino flick made with so much wit and brains and dazzle and virtuosity that the sheer speed and cleverness of the caper hits you like a shot of pure oxygen. Soderbergh after the impassioned socio-domestic panorama of ""Traffic"" now goes in the opposite direction crafting a cinematic layer cake of sheer sugar-high escapism. Once again he shot the movie himself and the result of this unusually up close and personal mode of directing is that his actors even in their most tossed-off moments come across with a vibrant immediacy that seems to emerge from the very grace notes of their personalities. For all the relationships on screen their real chemistry is with us. Soderbergh remaking the popular but weirdly half-baked 1960 Rat Pack buddy movie has thrown out just about everything but the storys skeletal outline refashioning the characters and more than that kicking the elaborateness of the heist up several notches (in the original it was slackville). Theres one way though that ""Oceans Eleven"" owes a crucial debt to its source The new film too offers up the spectacle of underworld camaraderie as a vogue projection of high masculine style. As Danny Ocean (George Clooney) an ex-con and professional thief assembles 11 motley cronies to rip off an underground vault linked to a trio of Las Vegas hotel casinos (the MGM Grand the Bellagio and the Mirage) hes a man with a mission but hes far too suave to value victory over swagger. The movie takes its cue from his underhandedly sexy no-fuss attitude of bemused nonchalance. Clooney a compulsive charmer doesnt at a glance do anything that he hasnt done before but he polishes his playful ironic twinkle to such a delectable gloss of hipster savvy that he seems to be redefining cool for the new millennium; he makes cool cool again. What is cool? In ""Oceans Eleven"" its mastering the boggling tactical safeguards of a corporate casino from the inside out; its saying everything on your mind but what you actually think; its staging the perfect crime as a pure throwaway getting high on grace under pressure. Danny has a hidden agenda His ex-wife Tess (Julia Roberts) is the girlfriend of the cutthroat casino owner Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) and Danny is eager to win her back. Clooney and Roberts forge a feisty bond but the beauty of the movie is in the way that Danny stages the entire heist as an act of seduction not so much penetrating the casino as tenderly undressing its operations. As he fills his men in on the fortress theyre up against (video-surveillance cage laser-studded elevator fingerprint IDs Uzi-wielding guards - and how in Gods name do you get out once youve nabbed the cash?) the mission is so farfetched as to be tantalizing and Soderbergh gives the action a hotfooted zing by revealing the details of the plan only as it unfolds right in front of us. In just about every heist film from ""Rififi"" to ""The Score"" theres an elaborate centerpiece sequence in which the gang executes some madly impossible feat in order to break through a six-foot steel door or a nuclear security system; at that moment the film inevitably stops in its tracks and says in essence ""Ooooh look at this"" ""Oceans Eleven"" has more of these audacious gambits than just about any heist film you could name yet the fun of the movie and also its slyboots joke is that the more fantastically elaborate the logistical ruse the more casual the film is about showcasing it. The tricks interlock in prankish split-second ways whether its the crusty old Jewish pro (Carl Reiner) doing Euro-aristo shtick in order to worm his way into the cage the pint-size Chinese acrobat (Shaobo Qin) leaping backward over the vaults electronic alarm floor or Matt Damon as a Ripleyesque pickpocket getting into a riotous staged racial conflagration with wily blackjack dealer Ber-nie Mac. Brad Pitt as Oceans right-hand captain does hilariously poker-faced Zen response lines always coughing them out a beat quicker than you expect. Soderbergh who has the wizardly off-kilter mind of a delinquent physics professor has mastered the art of making the impossible look easy. He steeps ""Oceans Eleven"" so thoroughly in the age of advanced technology that the film in effect comes out the other side of that era. Even when its catching us up in the tactical intrigue of how exactly to break into a vault thats more obsessively guarded than Fort Knox (one bit of advice Bring batteries) were invited to take the gimcrackery for granted. It wouldnt be wrong to call ""Oceans Eleven"" a trifle but its a debonair trifle made with high-wire effrontery the kind that cant be faked. This giddy and glancing charade is one of the most sheerly pleasurable movies to come out this year and it cements Soderberghs status as the reigning artist-entertainer at work in Hollywood today.

"Oceans Eleven | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; ocean-s-eleven ) Oceans Eleven (United States 2001) A movie review by James Berardinelli The good news is that the 2001 version of Oceans Eleven represents one of the rarest of Hollywood rarities a re-make that is actually better than the original. Thats not to say that this motion picture is an unqualified success - one tends to expect a little more from a director of Steven Soderberghs caliber. However 2001s Oceans Eleven moves along at an enjoyable clip and relies on more than the notoriety of its stars to pack movie theaters. The 1960 original was a sluggish unimpressive caper comedy that is best remembered as being the first time the so-called ""Rat Pack"" (Frank Sinatra Dean Martin Joey Bishop Peter Lawford Sammy Davis Jr.) appeared together on screen. The ""event"" didnt require much else resulting in a meandering film that fell short in the areas of plot character development humor and suspense. When producer Jerry Weintraub director Soderbergh and actor George Clooney elected to re-make Oceans Eleven they rectified some of the earlier movies glaring faults. So while this is a re-make in the sense that it borrows the 1960 pictures title and premise there are many many differences almost all of which represent improvements. Oceans Eleven is an entertaining but unambitious endeavor that combines traditional caper rhythms with comic riffs. Compared to another of 2001s pretzel-plot crime movies David Mamets Heist Oceans Eleven comes across as diluted. Both films are plot-driven with little room for the actors to do more than look good and project their personalities. Nevertheless the protagonists in Heist are better fleshed-out (possibly because there are fewer of them) and while Oceans Eleven contains its share of nicely-crafted lines for the actors to chew on the dialogue here never comes close to what Mamet scripted for his outing. George Clooney he of the great smile and unforced charm plays Danny Ocean a con-artist and thief who is planning his next job the day he gets out of a New Jersey prison on parole. For Danny this is the big one a three-casino robbery that will net more than 150 million. Even dividing the total take by eleven (the number of participants) the payout per person is enormous. Dannys crew consists of right-hand man Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) inside man Frank Catton (Bernie Mac) British bad guy Bashir Tarr (Don Cheadle) pick-pocket Linus Caldwell (Matt Damon) veteran con man Saul Bloom (Carl Reiner) moneybags Reuben Tishkoff (Elliot Gould) dueling brothers Turk and Virgil Malloy (Scott Caan and Casey Affleck) electronics expert Livingston Dell (Eddie Jemison) and contortionist/gymnast Yen (Shaobo Qin). Their goal is to liberate the financial resources of the trio of Vegas casinos run by Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) on the night of the Lennox Lewis-Wladimir Klitschko heavyweight battle. Since the money from the Bellagio the Mirage and the MGM Grand is all stored in the Bellagios vault only a single robbery is necessary. There are some obstacles - a ""security system [that] rivals that of most nuclear missile silos"" countless surveillance cameras a secure elevator with multiple safeguards against unauthorized entry armed guards a vault door that may be impregnable and Dannys ex-wife Tess (Julia Roberts) who is currently Terrys girlfriend. The movie provides an engaging two hours that develops in exactly the manner one would expect from this sort of production. The storyline while certainly not a masterpiece of plotting (there are numerous holes some of which are rather large) offers enough to keep audiences guessing and to inject a little tension into an otherwise harmless and lightweight enterprise. There are also sufficient moments of comedy to maintain an upbeat tone. I dont think I ever let out a hearty guffaw but I chuckled on a number of occasions. And of course there are plenty of familiar faces starting with Clooney and Brad Pitt in the lead roles and going all the way down to Julia Roberts in a rare supporting performance. Its a mark of how respected Soderbergh is that he was able to get so many name performers to accept pay cuts. Then again several of the participants including Clooney (Out of Sight) Roberts (Erin Brockovich) and Cheadle (Traffic) have worked with him before. The average viewers appreciation of Oceans Eleven will be influenced by expectations and in the case of older attendees memories of the original. Those anticipating something with the hard-hitting impact of an Erin Brockovich or Traffic will be disappointed. For Soderbergh this is not a quest for the Best Picture Oscar that eluded him last year - its an attempt to craft a popcorn movie. Of course theres a world of difference between an accomplished popcorn movie like this one and one thats oversalted. This is probably about the best anyone could do with Oceans Eleven. The high-wattage star power and unpredictable plot should give it healthy box office splash before it sinks beneath the waves made by the other December 2001 contenders.
