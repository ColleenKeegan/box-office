Jackson Alexandra Daddario Douglas Smith Behind the scenes Directed by Thor Freudenthal Rating PG for fantasy action violence some scary images and mild language Running time 1 hour 46 minutes Playing Throughout Orange County (See theaters and movie times for 3D and 2D screenings)The quick hitThe new entry about the boy demigod on a mission to save Olympus has some funny inventive patches but is generally too whiny listless and repetitive. Grade C Percy Jackson worries about being a ""one-quest wonder"" at the start of ""Percy Jackson The Sea of Monsters"" which could be more simply called ""I Am Still a Teenage Demigod."" After going from dysfunctional high-school student to savior of the universe he sounds like a malcontent to me. In the limp yet relatively amusing 2010 movie fantasy ""Percy Jackson amp; the Olympians The Lightning Thief"" Percy (Logan Lerman) discovered that hes the son of the Greek sea deity Poseidon. He promptly rescued both Olympus and the Earth as we know it from anarchy and destruction. He learned that his ADHD is just a symptom of his warrior reflexes and that his dyslexia is a result of his brain being hard-wired for ancient Greek. He also mastered water-based superpowers using a wave of his hands and some mighty concentration to shape H2O into impermeable water walls and destructive spouts. He forged battle-hardened friendships with a wisecracking satyr named Grover (Brandon T. Jackson) and a valiant demigoddess Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario) daughter of Athena goddess of wisdom and strategy. Unfortunately the way the filmmakers have shaped Rick Riordans best-selling series for the screen they doom him to follow the same arc all over again as if hes on a continuous loop of disappointment and triumph. In the lackluster listless ""Sea of Monsters"" hes too anxious to prove that his first victory was not a case of beginners luck. Just as he fought to impress Annabeth in ""The Lightning Thief"" in ""Sea of Monsters"" he struggles to win respect from another ultra-competitive demi-goddess Clarisse (Leven Rambin) daughter of the war god Ares. Clarisse has trounced Percy in competitions at the demigods haven Camp Half-Blood. So Clarisse gets the honor of trying to grab the Golden Fleece from the monstrous Cyclops Polyphemus. The fleece is crucial to the camps survival. Soon after ""Sea of Monsters"" begins the invisible barrier surrounding it gets breached. For years this invisible shield as tough as Colgates has emanated from a tree that grew out of the body of Zeus daughter. Now the tree is poisoned. Only the Golden Fleece can heal the tree and repair the shield. Percy decides to go rogue with Annabeth and Grover and as Grover puts it ""Bogart"" Clarisses quest. Some funny things do happen on the way to the fleece. Stanley Tucci shows up as the camps manager ""Mr. D"" -- a bored sad-eyed Dionysus cursed to see wine turn into water because of a punishment devised by Zeus. Percys newly arrived Cyclops half-brother Tyson (Douglas Smith) joins Percys mission. His one-eyed physiognomy brings a dash of humor to predictable lessons about overcoming prejudice -- in this case bias against the ""ocularly impaired."" The friends take a mad ride in a taxi run by three brassy immortal sisters who barely manage to keep ""an eye"" on the road because thats all they share - a single eye. Nathan Fillion brings his disconnected yet observant drollery to the role of Hermes the messenger god. In the wittiest sequence Hermes cover business turns out to be a UPS shop. Overall though the movie is too whiny listless and repetitive. Percys friendships dont get beyond base level not even his supposedly charged bond with Annabeth. If he isnt fretting about his prowess hes brooding about his lack of communication with an absent father. You worry that Percy will get into a ""Dad always liked you best"" routine with Tyson. Hermes nihilistic son Luke (Jake Abel) returns to make trouble. As vile as he is you cant help sharing his ""no not-this-again"" reaction when he sees Percy shape seawater into shields and weapons. The special effects are up down and middling. A steam-punk mechanical bull is fetching but the hippocampus a souped-up over-sized sea horse looks as if it jumped off a cheap beat-up carousel. The one visual coup harks back to the birth of Western civilization and the dawn of digital special effects. An oracle tells Percy the story of Kronos the Titan who ate his children so that no one would succeed him as ruler of the universe. (His son Zeus tricked and overthrew him.) That striking cartoon sequence is done in a style that resembles animated stained-glass windows. This marriage of modern and medieval imagery recalls the very first digital character in a feature film the stained-glass knight in the 1986 film ""Young Sherlock Holmes."" (It was created by then-unknown John Lasseter for director Barry Levinson. Chris Columbus wrote the script; he also directed the first Percy Jackson movie and produced this one.) When a conventional CGI Kronos shows up later hes a towering letdown. At one point in Riordans book (which is a lot livelier than the movie) Annabeth reminds Percy of Jason and the Argonauts and he responds ""Yeah. That old movie with the clay skeletons."" Ill take Ray Harryhausens puppets over this films made-by-pixels creatures any day. And dont get me started on the banal 3D. Near the end Percy tells Tyson he doesnt need dark glasses any more. I wish he could make the same promise to 3D-ODd moviegoers.

""Thief"" didnt set the domestic box office on fire but its overseas performance seems to have justified a similarly adequate follow-up in the form of ""Percy Jackson Sea of Monsters."" Being a demigod Percy (Logan Lerman) has some unresolved daddy issues -- namely that Poseidon doesnt really keep in touch anymore and that he was unaware of having a cyclops half-brother Tyson (Douglas Smith) until now. Tysons arrival at Camp Half-Blood (read Not Hogwarts) is soon followed by an attack on the camp and its protective barrier by lightning-thieving scallywag Luke (Jake Abel) and its up to Percy Tyson demigoddess Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario) and token satyr friend Grover (Brandon T. Jackson) to fetch the Golden Fleece from the Bermuda Triangle if they hope to save the world let alone the camp. Percy gripes about being ""a one-quest wonder"" Annabeth holds a slightly racist grudge against the one-eyed likes of Tyson and Grover vanishes for much of the middle as exposition and excitement are doled out at regular intervals. The plot is nothing new -- good guys and bad guys want the same mythical object -- although ""Wrath of the Titans"" recently did the whole resurrecting-Kronos plotline and the climax here reeks of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" Along the way we get mechanized fire-breathing bulls magical cab rides that owe a great debt to ""Harry Potters"" Knight Bus silliness cross-dressing satyrs fantastical tape guns tie-dye fish-horse whatsits and even more magical nonsense. For this film director Thor Fruedenthal (""Hotel for Dogs"" ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"") takes the reins from Chris Columbus and makes surprisingly adept use of digital effects throughout given those smaller simpler films that came before. Lerman Jackson Daddario and Smith are all blandly compatible with Abel reprising his Barry Pepper Jr. sneer during his villainous monologues while Leven Rambins Clarisse attempts to offer a cockier counterpart to Percys flagging reputation. (Naturally shes the daughter of Ares god of war.) A bit livelier are too-fleeting appearances by veteran actors Stanley Tucci (as Dionysus director of Camp Half-Blood) and Nathan Fillion (as Hermes Lukes father and fan of cancelled TV shows cough); meanwhile Anthony Head replaces Pierce Brosnan and youd be hard-pressed to notice the difference in sage mentorship. We get the usual world-ending stakes combined with the rampant invincibility that tends to cancel out said tension while appeasing worrisome young fans of Rick Riordans book series. So whats left to make ""Percy Jackson Sea of Monsters"" memorable? Precious little I must admit but its the odd touch of local color -- like the backdrop of an abandoned amusement park or the arrival of a Civil War steamer crewed by Confederate zombies -- that makes these routine acts of derring-do a bit easier to bear.

Photo 20th Century Fox Percy Jackson Sea of Monsters review Preteen fun 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Percy Jackson Sea of Monsters Adventure. Starring Logan Lerman Douglas Smith Stanley Tucci and Nathan Fillion. Directed by Thor Freudenthal. (PG. 104 minutes.) The rampaging bull in ""Percy Jackson Sea of Monsters"" looks like something an 11-year-old boy might draw on the back of his math homework when he should be paying attention to his teacher instead. The villainous beast is gold has steampunk innards and opens its mouth to reveal a giant flamethrower. This bad guy is boss rad hella sweet or whatever the sixth-grader slang is for cool in 2013. The same can be said for much of the second ""Percy Jackson"" movie which is outgunned by summer movies with larger budgets and bigger names in the cast. Pierce Brosnan doesnt return leaving Stanley Tucci as the biggest star. But the sequel effectively executes its simple vision - to provide clever PG entertainment for preteens whose parents are too strict to let them watch ""The Wolverine."" Logan Lerman returns as Percy the son of Poseidon who hangs in Camp Half-Blood with other teenage god-spawn and fantastic creatures. The tree-deity that protects this little retreat of raging hormones is threatened so Percy and his friends go on a journey to seek the healing powers of a Golden Fleece. ""Sea of Monsters"" based on the Rick Riordan young adult novel weaves Greek mythology with modern updates. Tucci as Dionysus is the camp director. God of commerce and speed Hermes - a nice cameo by Nathan Fillion - runs the overnight delivery company Olympic Postal Service. When our heroes must storm a boat its a luxury yacht. They reach their destination on the back of a hippocampus which looks like the result of an amorous relationship between a racehorse and a rainbow trout. The special effects occasionally fall closer to ""Sharknado"" than ""Pacific Rim"" but director Thor Freudenthal does a good job of stretching the budget. A flashback scene is animated with a stained glass technique. A giant obstacle-course play structure reminiscent of TVs ""Wipeout"" is an effective practical effect. Early scenes take the orphan fantasies of Harry Potter and the X-Men and up the ante. Most of these kids have a god for a dad and a mother who is completely out of the picture. (We didnt even see any care packages filled with cookies and fresh underwear sent to Camp Half-Blood.) A notorious hard-partying wine drinker runs the camp. What 12-year-old in the audience wouldnt sign up for that? The film lacks a central bad guy and the quest starts to develop the dopey procedural feel of a Scooby Doo episode - amplified by the addition of a shaggy Cyclops boy (Douglas Smith) who creates new obstacles for the protagonists with his cluelessness. Cynical moviegoers will note that many Half-Blood campers look as if theyre in their late 20s. Big parts of the book are missing replaced by awkward edits. Finally discriminating adults may find the dialogue a bit groan-worthy. (""Its not cool to Bogart someone elses quest"") Middle school English teachers and librarians who see the parallels to Greek mythology may be more forgiving. Anything to get the kids interested in the classics ... Its an easy film to pick apart but the result is positive - especially if youre a child or sitting next to one. There are plenty of bad films to get riled up about in the summer. ""Percy Jackson Sea of Monsters"" isnt one of them. This is harmless tween-centric fun.

It had something to do with a young kid named Percy Jackson (Logan Lerman) learning that hes the son of the Greek god Poseidon and discovering the secret Harry Potter-like world of his fellow demigods. (To be honest all I really remember of the film was that it was really loud.) But apparently it was successful enough that theyve now made a sequel. As it begins Percy and his friends Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario) daughter of Athena and the satyr Grover (Brandon T. Jackson) are firmly ensconced at Hogwar ... I mean Camp Half-Blood ""the only place on Earth that is safe for our kind"" where theyre learning to use their powers and engaging in various competitions with other demigods. But thanks in part to the fact that Poseidon is an absentee father Percy is having doubts about his self-worth. So he mopes around lakes talking to the water waiting for a response. Hes not sure hes genuinely earned any of the respect accorded him by his peers a situation made worse by the fact that hes also being bullied by Clarisse (Leven Rambin) a daughter of Ares who keeps besting him at various camp trials. The specific adventure this time around follows Percy and his friends along with Clarisse and her better-equipped A-team as they travel to the Sea of Monsters which we normal humans know as the Bermuda Triangle in an attempt to retrieve the legendary magical Golden Fleece.A  Also after the Fleece are a rogue band of demigods led by Luke (Jake Abel) the wayward son of Hermes who want to use it to revive Kronos the brutal father who was slain by Zeus back in the day and buried inside Mt. Tartarus. (For those keeping score at home this was roughly also the bad guys evil plan in The Immortals a couple of years ago.) The good news is that Percy has just learned of a prophecy that deems he might be the one to defeat the resurrected Kronos and save the gods of Olympus. Or he might wind up destroying them; this being a prophecy its kind of vague. Interestingly for all their time spent at Camp Half-Blood our heroes have apparently learned very little actual mythology given how basic concepts such as the Golden Fleece have to be explained to them; imagine a camp full of Christians who have to look up Adam and Eve or the Holy Grail. Part of this is of course because the Percy Jackson stories make mincemeat of the original fables but still this kind of broad-strokes clunkily expository storytelling dooms The Sea of Monsters right from the beginning. You dont get the sense that anybody has spent any time trying to find ways to convey all this information with any artistry or nuance or surprise. The Harry Potter films had lots of exposition too but at their best they were able to convey it with some flair or suspense allowing characters to gradually discover the backstory without having it constantly dictated to them. Running counter to the regurgitative nature of the rest of the movie one animated sequence relates the death of Kronos with stained glass figures come to life; iconography-wise its a bit of a hodgepodge but its the one visually interesting scene in the film. Tucci gets some good lines in as the jaded wine-loving Dionysus who runs Camp Half-Blood. (When Zeus turns his wine into water he retorts ""You know Christians have a guy who can do this thing in reverse. Now thats a god"") Nathan Fillion lends some much-needed energy in a brief appearance as Hermes who owns (what else?) a mail delivery company called OPS (Olympus Postal Service) and is seeking to expand. To help navigate the Bermuda Triangle one character resurrects an old Civil War-era warship manned by a zombie crew. But for every imaginative bit theres more than enough wan recitation of the usual mystical-magical YA cliches unfunny gags (are those ""ethnic"" snakes on Hermess herald staff?) plus sad-sack borrowings from other better films like Raiders of the Lost Ark or Star Wars. Even for those missing their Harry Potter fix this is some weak watered-down stuff.

Our trio of teenage protagonists Harry Hermione and Ron Percy Annabeth and Grover are busily honing their superhuman skills at their home away from home Hogwarts Camp Halfblood a secret sanctuary where wizards demigods are safe from the prying eyes of ordinary folk.But trouble of course is brewing. Thalias Tree which protects Camp Halfblood from invading monsters has been poisoned and the only hope for a cure is the Golden Fleece hidden away in the ""Sea of Monsters."" (Thats the Bermuda Triangle to you and me.) So our young heroes joined by Percys comical half-brother a Cyclops named Tyson set out to...Related Story Blue Jasmine An Interesting Disappointment Oh who am I kidding. Its that point in the summer again when Im at a complete loss for anything useful to say about a kids movie sequel that doesnt aspire to be anything more than a kids movie sequel. So Im using my once-a-year lifeline and calling in the genuine experts Alex (as in Alexandra) who turned eight yesterday and Tom who turns 10 in a week and a half (and has usefully read all the Percy Jackson books multiple times).They grow up so fast The last time I consulted Alex and Tom it was for Ice Age Continental Drift. The next time it will probably be for a Lars von Trier film. In any case this is where those of you who are uninterested in preadolescent movie criticism should probably bail.(At Alexs request Tom answered most of the questions first.)If you had to describe the new Percy Jackson movie in one word what would it be?Tom I would describe it as either exciting awesome or kind of brilliant because I think it was very well set up.As good as the first movie or better?Tom A lot better than the first movie. It just seemed that the first movie didnt have as much happening in it. The second movie is like--boom pow--it starts out with a really big thing when theyre showing--Alex A backstory. [ed. No I had no idea she knew this word.]Tom ...a backstory about how Thalia became a tree and guarded the camp.What about you Alex?Alex I think its better than the first because its more exciting and it has a lot more action all the way through.What was your favorite part of the movie?Tom Either when Percy was blowing a hole in Charybdiss gut or when he was slicing off Kronoss limbs. [My son future Tarantino aficionado.] They left out a couple parts of the book but they also added some new parts. All in all I think it was a little better than the book.Alex I think my favorite part was probably the prologue [nope didnt know she knew this one either] with Thalia. I usually like kind of sad parts and its like shes giving her life to save three others.Who was your favorite character?Alex Probably Thalia even though she didnt have that big a role.Tom I liked Tyson best far and away. He dealt with Annabeths being mean to him--he just like shrugged it off. He was hard to kill but it was also hard for his feelings to be hurt. And he would not give up on Percy and his friends.He had a lot of jokey parts too.""I found the manticore very scary.""Tom Yeah I liked it when he was like ""Bad cow""--punch. [This was during a fight with the Colchis Bull.] And I liked when Tyson is in the boat holding the magical wind container and the boat is flying along and then the boat suddenly stops and Annabeths like why did we stop and Tyson comes back empty handed and says ""I probably should have held on with both hands.""Were there any parts of the movie that you thought were scary?Tom Not really. When I first saw those things in the ocean and I thought they were shark fins Im like ""Oh God you guys are dead."" And then when I realized they were Charybdiss teeth Im like ""You are even more dead.""Alex Well I thought there were a lot of scary parts because Id never seen it before. Like Charybdis and also that giant scorpion-tailed guy--Tom The manticore.Alex I found the manticore very scary.If there were something that you could change about the movie what would it be?Tom I didnt really like that early part at Camp Halfblood when Percy and Clarisse were both climbing that training tower--it was okay I guess but they didnt really need it. It just showed that Clarisse was more self-absorbent [way too good to correct] than Percy and were going to see more of that later anyway.Alex Well I would appreciate it if they didnt put zombies everywhere. And if the Gray Ladies didnt look so creepy.Other thoughts on the movie?Tom If you have like four-year-olds--four- or five-year-olds--it might be kind of risky taking them to it. Some of it can get pretty scary. But if your kids are especially brave and they like Greek mythology theyll like this a lot.Alex Yeah I think five and under would be too young.What was your favorite movie of the year so far?Tom I liked Percy Jackson Sea of Monsters best and then either Smurfs 2 or Despicable Me 2.Alex I think Percy Jackson and the Smurfs were my two favorites.So you guys really liked The Smurfs 2? [note I havent seen the movie. I love my children but there are limits.]Alex In Smurfs 2 there are two new Smurfs that arent blue--the Naughties--and Gargamel creates them like he created Smurfette. And theyre trying to get Smurfette to tell them the secret formula to make them blue.Why do they want to be blue?Tom The Naughties want to be blue because they think gray is a really bad color. But also Gargamel wants them to be blue so he can take away the essence from them and put it in his wand. He thinks hell be all [villain voice] ""Im so powerful I will rule the world ha ha ha"" Hes that kind of guy you know? The guys that are evil maniacs?So if people are trying to pick a movie to go see this week...Tom This is just some advice. If youre a family and you want to see a good movie and dont know whether to watch Percy Jackson or The Smurfs--well if you have some young kids that get scared pretty easily The Smurfs 2 might be a better choice. But if you have kids that are pretty old and they like action I think Percy Jackson would be a better choice.Alex Yes thats it exactly.Note This review is intended for entertainment purposes only. Percy Jackson Sea of Monsters is currently at 26 percent on Rotten Tomatoes and The Smurfs 2 is at 12 percent. So as much as I adore my kids their critical enthusiasm is probably best taken with a grain of salt.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

Updated on July 29 at 930 p.m. DURHAM N.C.--The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down key portions of North Carolinas strict 2013 voting law on Friday delivering a stern rebuke to the states Republican General Assembly and Governor Pat McCrory. The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting.

Percy Jackson Sea of Monsters (PG) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Percy Jackson Sea of Monsters (PG) Perhaps the third installment will be the charm. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle | coglemiamiherald.com8/7/2013 Editor rating 1.5 In Percy Jackson Sea of Monsters choosing the dumbest character is a colossal task. Is it one of the young heroes who stand around staring when they should be running or share tender moments when they should be finishing off an evil opponent? Is it the young villain who doesnt understand that resurrecting a carnivorous god famous for eating his children is perhaps not the safest or smartest way to rebel against the status quo? Or are these characters merely prisoners -- much like the audience -- of a script so uninspired that it demands their stupidity? Hard to say. Whats easier to deduce though is that this second installment in the series based on Rick Riordans popular young adult fantasy novels is a dud. Sea of Monsters -- which strangely includes precisely one sea monster not nearly enough by my reckoning -- is slow-paced and slow-witted with curiously lackluster action scenes that trudge along with all the thrill of a homework assignment. Sea of Monsters finds Percy (Logan Lerman of The Perks of Being a Wallflower) and his pals at Camp Half Blood a safe haven for the offspring of some seriously promiscuous gods judging by the large number of young people there. Percys dad is Poseidon which gives Percy the ability to manipulate water although in terms of parental guidance Poseidon is really sort of a deadbeat. Kinship with him will allow you to create waves but dont expect that talk on the birds and the bees anytime soon. This may explain the lack of even a hint of blossoming romance between these teenagers who should be walking hormones at this age. Even Harry and Ron and Hermione smooched their classmates. When a mechanical bull breaches the force field that protects the camp and a very important tree begins to die the kids set off on a quest to retrieve the Golden Fleece. Its healing properties can save the tree and restore the protective magical barrier and recovering it can also put to rest Percys fears that his role in the events of The Lightning Thief was not a fluke. Familiarity with the first movie isnt necessary to follow the action but coming to Sea of Monsters with a deep affection for these characters would be helpful. The film versions are impossibly bland from Percy to his girl sidekick Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario) to his satyr BFF (Brandon T. Jackson) to the bossy competitive Clarisse (Leven Rambin). The only one who achieves any measure of charisma is Douglas Smith (Big Love) as Tyson Percys cheerful half brother who also happens to be a Cyclops. Sadly Tyson gives rise to a tiresome sideplot about Cyclops bigotry which doesnt seem unreasonable when you consider that theres a flesh-eating Cyclops guarding the fleece and just waiting for some tasty Half Bloods to show up and retrieve it. The adults are mostly wasted -- why bother to cast Nathan Fillion when youre going to upstage him with a couple of unfunny bickering snakes? -- but at least the final scene offers potential for the next film. But until the screenwriters add depth to these characters and learn to stage an action sequence the next Percy Jackson will end up just like this one a reminder of how much better the Harry Potter movies were.

"Review Percy Jackson Sea of Monsters a heroic effort for demigod - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Percy Jackson Sea of Monsters a heroic effort for demigod Only a handful of movies qualify for the exclusive club of films that have taken in more than 1 billion in worldwide box office -- and only three have made more than 2 billion. By Charles Fleming | Sources Los Angeles Times Box Office Mojo Gary Goldstein After a terrific turn in last years fine indie drama ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" Logan Lerman is back in franchise-land. This time the engaging young actor reprises his role as earnest demigod (that is half human-half god) Percy Jackson in the action-fantasy ""Percy Jackson Sea of Monsters."" Skippable 3-D aside its a serviceable limber follow-up to 2010s ""Percy Jackson amp; the Olympians The Lightning Thief"" again based on a novel from the Greek mythology-inspired adventure series by Rick Riordan.The new installment finds a self-doubting Percy son of sea god Poseidon off on another Olympus-saving escapade now with a trio of lively cohorts Grover (Brandon T. Jackson) a skittish satyr (half man-half goat); Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario) daughter of Athena goddess of wisdom; and a newly discovered half brother Tyson (Douglas Smith) who -- surprise -- is a Cyclops albeit a kindly one. (Talk about strange bedfellows Tyson is the offspring of Poseidon and a sea nymph hence the kids one -- and only -- eye. And let me just say eew.) The quartet is on a quest to the Sea of Monsters (a.k.a. the Bermuda Triangle) to capture the legendary Golden Fleece from yet another Cyclops -- this one of the colossal deadly and ravenous variety. The point so that the fleeces magical powers can help restore the invisible shield that critically protects Camp Half-Blood -- a kind of Hogwarts for god-spawns -- that was destroyed by a raging mechanical bull (and not the type you see in country-western bars either).PHOTOS Summer Sneaks 2013 Theres a host of other treacherous myth-centric obstacles in the way of Percys posse most of which make for fairly diverting visual effects-heavy set pieces. These include a breakneck ride in a taxi driven by three blind witches a fantastic voyage through the stomach of a vast sea monster and a climactic battle with the vengeful child-swallowing Titan god Kronos the series ongoing antagonist.Also intersecting with Percy and company are the hyper-competitive Clarisse (Leven Rambin) daughter of war god Ares; Half-Blood turncoat (and the first films ""lightning thief"") Luke (Jake Abel) son of Hermes messenger of the gods; Hermes himself (a broad Nathan Fillion) reimagined here as a spirited UPS worker; camp leader -- and wine enthusiast -- Dionysus or ""Mr. D"" (Stanley Tucci having fun); and wise centaur (half man-half horse) Chiron (Anthony Head) among others. If the characterizations throughout are pretty thin they largely fill the bill.The film directed by Thor Freudenthal (""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"") from a script by Marc Guggenheim doubles as a kind of crash course in Greek mythology though its more academic references and middling-joke asides may elude much younger viewers.

All that elusive improvisatory strangeness that alien sense of causality that emphasis on origins not just of franchisable characters but of everything in the natural world right down to the sea foam that came into being when the Titan Kronos ripped off his fathers genitals and chucked them into the surf birthing Aphrodite from the union of ocean and sperm.Hesiods madness I fear would have to be expurgated made explicable the ore of folklore pounded into the salable tchotchke of Young Adult plotting. In Percy Jackson Sea of Monsters Kronos lives and rages an igneous marvel of special effects but if hes still into hilarious castrations this sleepy PG kids adventure doesnt dare hint at it. Hes a Titan in name only a dumb stomping monster rather than some unknowable force from creations dawn. Unlike weird discursive myth screenwriting is too economical to allow his rampaging to build to something disgusting or ridiculous or beautiful. Hes not even afforded an inventive defeat being brought down by--spoiler presuming you give a shit--the same dumb sword Percy Jackson has carried since movie one Percy Jackson and the Derp of Derp. Here killing the father of goddamn Zeus is less a to-do than kabooming the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.Its a compliment I guess that the stubborn familiarity of this conclusion--all noble sacrifices and meaningless resurrections--is capable of disappointing. That means the rest managed to raise some hopes if not quite expectations. Before it descends into Percy Jackson and the Things That Happen in Movies Like This the adventure at times clicks into the inventive groove of Rick Riordans Percy Jackson novels which at their best are touched with the high strangeness of the ancient tales that inspire them. (The books about the offspring of the Greek gods and mortals rarely feel like off-brand Harry Potter the way the movies do.)Film Details Percy Jackson Sea of Monsters RatingPG GenreAction/Adventure Running Time106 More Info Trailer Jacksons mission is to filch the Golden Fleece from a Cyclops in the Bermuda Triangle. To that end director Thor Freudenthal stages a rousing attack by a clockwork bull a gears-and-fury beast whose mouth hinges open to reveal a flamethrower and presents a magical animated infodump where all the gods of Olympus are rendered in stained glass. (Hey if its good enough for one god its good enough for all of them)The Stygian witches turn up as cab drivers in a frenetic goof of a sequence squabbling as always over that lone eyeball and suggesting the free-spirited grossness of Peter Jacksons The Frighteners. Then there are the sea-beasts first a beauty of a swimming horse streaked like that Fruit Stripes zebra and then the great maw stomach and guts of Charybdis herself who it turns out is responsible for every boat and plane thats gone missing in the North Atlantic. To escape her digestive tract Jackson mans the machine guns of a U-boat crewed by the living corpses of Confederate soldiers--a development that the film to its credit never attempts to explain. And the villainous Cyclops is a treat the heroes encounter with him smartly shot and just the right amount of scary.But even Homer nods. Much of the rest is a deadly bore with the too-old-to-pass-for-teens stars playing characters with one trait apiece--and failing to bring that trait to life. Usually when you see actors this pretty and this vacant standing around this awkwardly you expect them to take their clothes off. Logan Lermans Jackson exhibits none of the troubled complexity of the ADHD-addled boy of the books; the filmmakers forget key tenets of his character just as often as the movies villains forget the basics of his parentage. Seriously if you kidnapped the son of Poseidon would you imprison him on a yacht--in the ocean?The god-kids all live together in a summer camp called Not-Hogwarts where counselor Dionysus (Stanley Tucci as funny as the script allows) dresses like Captain Lou Albano and moans that angry Zeus changes all his wine into water. The kids meanwhile compete in elaborate wall-climbing contests right out of the Real World/Road Rules Challenge. Then the story starts with a ferocious attack on their camp--and Percys dear smart friend Not-Hermione (Alexandra Daddario) figuring out (on her iPad) that the Fleece of the Argonauts is the only way to stop the blah blah something something.Not-Hermiones one trait She hates Cyclopes for reasons the books make clear but the movie cant be buggered about. That means of course a young Cyclops must tag along on the adventure and Not-Hermione gets to glower at him and then learn a lesson about not judging people just because theyre monsters. That Cyclops is just another kid-flick hunk this one with white-boy dreads like hes in some one-eyed jam band. The story contrives to give him a human set of peepers for about half the movie and much of the rest of the time hes wearing sunglasses which is a perfect encapsulation of modern screenwritings approach to rich inscrutable myth ""A Cyclops? Love it But does he have to have one eye?""Also 3D has never been more wasted.Subscribe to the Voice Film Club podcastFollow VoiceFilmClub Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Alan Scherstuhl Follow studiesincrap Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

"Percy Jackson Sea of Monsters visually stunning review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesPercy Jackson Sea of Monsters visually stunning review The second Percy Jackson adventure is fast-paced with visual imagery that should please younger audiences.By Bruce DeMaraEntertainmentWed. Aug. 7 2013Percy Jackson Sea of MonstersStarring Logan Lerman Alexandra Daddario. Directed by Thor Freudenthal. 100 minutes. Opens Aug. 7 at major theatres. PGHis voice is a little deeper the coif a bit less Justin Bieber two hairstyles ago. But Percy Jackson is a typical teen awkward and wracked by self-doubt.The title of the sequel has been pared down from the original Percy Jackson and the Olympians The Lightning Thief (try fitting that on a theatre marquee) but the action remains on par as once again Percy and friends face a sea of troubles.Article Continued BelowThis time out Luke (played by Jake Abel) the villain of the first film invades the sanctity of Camp Half-Blood where Percy and a host of other demigods and the like hang out and train for battle. Percy Jackson (played by Logan Lerman) is off on a new quest filled with sea monsters and danger.But Luke wants to wreak havoc on a grander scale to use the Golden Fleece to bring Cronos -- the godfather of all the Olympian gods -- back from the dead. For some reason the legendary sheepskin is located in the Bermuda Triangle a.k.a. the Sea of Monsters.If all of this sounds rather silly bear in mind this film isnt really intended for adult audiences. With its broad humour and less than serious tone its clearly aimed at tween and teen set and its likely to be a crowd-pleaser among that demographic.Logan Lerman who resembles a combination of Zac Efron and Tim Robbins returns as Percy Jackson and hes a solid anchor in a film where ham acting is not discouraged. Witness Stanley Tuccis turn as Dionysus a.k.a. Mr. D. who favours leopard print shirts mispronounces everyones name and lets the one-liners fly at everyone.""You want to go on a quest? It must be Thursday"" Mr. D. wryly observes when Percy and company decide they must seek out the Golden Fleece to save Camp Half-Blood and their Olympian parents. Brandon T. Jackson returns as Grover Percys sort of protector and hes much less annoying this time out. That role is reserved for newcomer Clarisse (played with caustic gusto by Leven Rambin).Director Thor Freudenthal (Diary of a Wimpy Kid) replaces veteran Chris Columbus who directed the first Percy and he keeps things moving along at a near breakneck pace. In that respect Percy 2 is a better film than its predecessor.Shot in 3-D Freudenthal makes the film a visual treat a sumptuous banquet of very cool and exotic creatures land and seascapes. One scene a sort of stained glass montage is particularly dazzling.Percy learns hes got a half-brother named Tyson half god-half cyclops (played with real empathy by Douglas Smith) which means he has a single eye in the middle of his forehead (though a magic mist spray conceals it for part of the film.) Its an ideal opportunity to provide an object lesson for young audiences that people who may look different are every bit as worthy as the rest of us. Purists will no doubt take offense at how ruthlessly the script -- based on the books by Rick Riordan -- plunders and exploits the ancient Greek myths. And theres also a crew of zombies on a Confederate warship that seem to serve little purpose.But these are not matters germane to the young audience which is likely to find Percy Jackson Sea of Monsters a visually stunning and magical journey.

Share Tweet For a movie whose subtitle is Sea Of Monsters the new Percy Jackson film sure skimps on the wild things. Sure there are a few a ramping mechanical bull that looks both cool and unbelievably phony a snarling feline beastie with a scorpion stinger and a giant leviathan with teeth the size of shark fins and a belly teeming with unlucky sailors. (A sight to see that one.) Occasional creatures aside Sea Of Monsters overdoses instead on mythology and not just the Greek kind on which its fanciful world of gods and demigods is built. This is an all-ages fantasy adventure that never stops bombarding its audience with information--about magic spells ancient grudges and the rules of interspecies breeding. Characters dont so much have conversations as read Dungeons amp; Dragons manuals at each other. The whole thing feels like exposition in search of a story. It must have taken some herculean number crunching to justify a sequel to 2010s tepidly received Percy Jackson amp; The Olympians The Lightning Thief one of several recent attempts to spin a kids-lit book series into a Potter-sized film series. Logan Lerman so affecting as the wallflower of The Perks Of Being A Wallflower returns as teenage demigod Percy bastard son of Poseidon and a hero bland enough to make a certain bespectacled wizard seem multidimensional. He and his fellow illegitimate half-bloods--the deities are basically all deadbeat dads--live together at a magical summer camp this franchises answer to Hogwarts. When not competing in Wipeout-style obstacle courses and clashing with a fiercely competitive teen titan (Leven Rambin Iceman to Lermans Maverick) Percy is pining for the guidance of his absentee father. (Considering that Kevin McKidd who played Poseidon in the first film is absent from the new films cast list he probably shouldnt hold his breath.) Determined to be more than a ""one-quest wonder"" Percy rounds up his posse--Brandon T. Jacksons wisecracking satyr Alexandra Daddarios bossy daughter of Athena--and heads for the Bermuda Triangle. Also along for the ride is his one-eyed half-brother (Douglas Smith) whose presence makes the Cyclops-hating Daddario uncomfortable. See its not all Harry Potter redux In this magical world the Hermione Granger character is a racist Here and there some of this starts to feel a little less like homework and more like fun. Though part one used up many of the good monsters--like Medusa and the hydra--part two is a fleeter entertainment free of origin-story requirements. Its also marginally better made While Chris Columbus brought his leaden Sorcerers Stone touch to The Lightning Thief new director Thor Freudenthal (Diary Of A Wimpy Kid) demonstrates a greater flair for CGI spectacle. Squint hard enough and its possible to pretend youre watching a kind of YA version of Raiders Of The Lost Ark complete with a scene of the heroes tied up while the villains unwisely unleash an ancient evil. Meanwhile those hoping for more of the high-camp cameos that distinguished the original will have to settle for Stanley Tucci hamming it up as a sardonic Dionysus and a couple of Whedon regulars dropping by for comic relief.

Only with thunderbolts and tridents. And theyre back -- along with an assortment of demi-god teenagers and some nasty legendary beasts -- in ""Percy Jackson Sea of Monsters"" the second in the modern mythological franchise. But its all a little late and a little less than needed. The first film ""Percy Jackson and the Olympians The Lightning Thief"" came out three years ago and introduced us to the titular hero a New York teen and a half-mortal son of Poseidon. In true Harry Potter fashion though he didnt know this -- until he was whisked off to a special school given some magical training and told he had a destiny to fulfill (with the help of -- hmm -- a cranky teacher a cute girl and a funny friend). Familiar or not it was an entertaining little movie with some fresh material and loads of stand-out guest spots -- Uma Thurman as Medusa Pierce Brosnan as a friendly centaur and Rosario Dawson and Steve Coogan as Peresphone and Hades. And director Chris Columbus -- whod already done the same favor for the Potter franchise -- got things off to a good start hitting just the right balance between small-fry fantasy and serious thrills introducing the basic story while moving things smartly along. This time around though as Brosnan clearly had other things to do Anthony Head takes over his four-hoofed duties. The guest stars -- Nathan Fillion as Hermes Stanley Tucci as a PG-rated Dionysus -- arent quite as surprising or as much fun. And in the world of kid movies -- well three years is a lifetime or at least a sizable fraction thereof. All this time later its hard to get immediately back into the narrative or remember whats at stake. (This film brings back a half-remembered bad boy and yet another vengeful plot to reduce Olympus to rubble.) Logan Lerman who was clearly starting to move beyond movies like this with ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" returns as our modest hero with bright-eyed Alexandra Daddario as his platonic girlfriend. As an easily scared satyr Brandon T. Jackson is once again the franchises most valuable player. But then three years into this series weve clearly moved down to the B team. While Columbus - who is still the producer - was never anyones idea of an auteur hes still several steps above Thor Freudenthal the director of such classics as ""Hotel for Dogs."" The film has no real look of its own and seems to proceed by fits and starts. There are a few good scenes all of them self-contained action sequences -- a fight on a yacht (which feels weirdly reminiscent of a Bond film) a battle with a fire-breathing mechanical bull a set-to with a cyclops. (Although when the chief villain arrives he looks far more Christian devil than Hellenic deity.) But the movie feels like a watch-the-bottom-line effort thats determined to skimp on everything -- guest stars effects spectacle -- while bringing in new characters we dont care about. The final scene promises yet another chapter to come of Zeus and gang. Its hard to view that as anything but an idol threat. Ratings note The film contains some scary scenes. Percy Jackson Sea of Monsters (PG) Fox (106 min.) Directed by Thor Freudenthal. With Logan Lerman Alexandra Daddario Nathan Fillion.

By NANCY CHURNIN nchurnindallasnews.com Staff Writer Published 06 August 2013 0459 PM Updated 06 August 2013 0459 PM Related Castle star Nathan Fillion makes his monster debut in Monsters University New Hunger Games Catching Fire trailer is amazing A boy discovers he has strange powers he must learn to harness if he is to fulfill his destiny to save the world but is unsure whether hes up to the task.Yes Percy Jackson seems to have borrowed a page or two from the Harry Potter playbook but with an American twist. Our heroes -- half-blood children of the Greek gods -- find the portals between our world and everything from Circes island to Olympus itself conveniently located right here in the good old U.S.A. What are the odds?Percy Jackson Sea of Monsters is the second film adapted from the popular five-book series by native Texan Rick Riordan. The talented Logan Lerman who distinguished himself in between the Jackson films with The Perks of Being a Wallflower is back as Percy (short for Perseus) the son of Poseidon god of the sea.With director Thor Freudenthal taking over for two-time Harry Potter director Chris Columbus who helmed in 2010 this film hits its stride in a way the first one never did. That includes the new 3-D effects which add an extra dollop of peril to everything from a charging bronze bull to a big red Titan who comes across as part giant Transformers villain.In keeping with the second book Percy and his fellow demigods go on a quest to find the Golden Fleece to heal a poisoned tree that has magical powers to protect their camp. Smartly the fast-moving action stays centered on the young cast as they solve their problems in contrast with the first in which Percy mediated battles between adult gods (Percy Jackson amp; the Olympians The Lightning Thief).In fact the adults are so peripheral here that few may notice theyre played by different actors. Stanley Tucci brings wit to Dionysus who grouses because Zeus keeps turning his wine into water. Nathan Fillion pours on the charm as Hermes the go-to guy for extraordinary gadgets in ordinary-looking objects including a spray can that shoots out great winds to speed the kids on their way.But the best part is the introduction of Tyson Percys half-brother a half-Cyclops played by Douglas Smith. With others bullying Tyson for having one eye and Percys friend Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario) muttering that all in the Cyclops family are bad Tysons loyalty bravery and good heart score big points on embracing those who are different.Follow Nancy Churnin on Twitter at nchurnin.Percy Jackson Sea of Monsters(B) Directed by Thor Freudenthal.

RELATED NEWS 10 best movies based on mythology By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Tue Aug 6 2013 126 PM The first ""Percy Jackson"" movie wasnt great but it was fun with a kind of underdog ""Harry Potter"" vibe that carried it farther than it might otherwise have traveled. That vibe is nowhere to be found in ""Percy Jackson Sea of Monsters"" one of the more-disappointing sequels since ... oh maybe when ""Smurfs 2"" came out. So obviously the bar isnt set that high but ""Percy"" still manages to fumble underneath it. Much of the cast returns including Logan Lerman who plays Percy. But Chris Columbus who directed the first film has handed the reins to Thor Freudenthal whose credits include ""Hotel for Dogs"" and ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid."" Thats not a good swap. Percy for those who didnt see the first film or havent read Rick Riordans popular novels is the son of Poseidon though his mother is human. (She was played by Catherine Keener in the first film; sadly shes not in this one.) This makes him a half-blood half human half god. He and others of his kind live in Camp Half-Blood where they can stage incredibly dangerous contests among themselves and not worry about breaking each others necks. Because you know godlike powers that kind of thing. Percy saved the world the first time around which makes him a big deal around Camp Half-Blood. His friends Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario) and Grover (Brandon T. Jackson) keep him grounded and new arrival Clarisse (Leven Rambin) tries to best him at every turn often succeeding. But theres trouble afoot. The shield that protects Camp Half-Blood from the rest of the world is failing. Only one thing can save it the Golden Fleece which Jason and the Argonauts famously sought. (This version wont stand the same test of time.) Clarisse sets off on a quest for the fleece; Percy Annabeth and Grover conduct a competing quest of their own. Theyre joined by Tyson (Douglas Smith) a Cyclops and it turns out Percys half-brother a development so ill-fitting its like when Cousin Oliver joined ""The Brady Bunch."" Unfortunately for both groups Luke (Jake Abel) presumed killed in the first movie is back and he wants the fleece for his own evil purposes. (His return is actually a good thing because Abel is one of the more-entertaining presences in both films.) From there its quest quest quest with lots of computer-generated challenges and fights along the way. There are some nice touches. Nathan Fillion is a hoot as Hermes Lukes estranged father; he has the funniest line in the film one that will be lost on anyone not familiar with a certain short-lived television series with which he was associated. And Stanley Tucci is good as Mr. D. short for Dionysus who runs Camp Half-Blood. But what makes mythology so great is its sense of danger the threat of real loss. This version of ""Percy"" has none of that. Granted this is a movie aimed at children and young teens but it becomes clear early on that there is nothing including death from which our gang cant escape. By the end of the film this is taken to ludicrous extremes. Too bad. Lerman who was outstanding in ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" is a talented actor. The whole cast is enjoyable in fact with good chemistry. Theyre capable of entertaining us. Unfortunately Freudenthal and writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski never really let them.

Rated PG BOTTOM LINE With ""Harry Potter"" gone this franchise is starting to feel slightly less derivative. Eye-catching effects help hide the cribbing. CAST Logan Lerman Alexandra Daddario Brandon T. Jackson LENGTH 146 With the young wizards of ""Harry Potter"" fading from memory the demigod teenagers of ""Percy Jackson"" are starting to seem like the next best thing. The first film 2010s ""Percy Jackson amp; the Olympians The Lightning Thief"" based on Rick Riordans young-adult novel seemed way too Rowlingesque a fantasy-adventure set in a magical boarding school and directed by ""Potter"" veteran Chris Columbus. The follow-up ""Percy Jackson Sea of Monsters"" has a new director and a little more room to breathe in the movie marketplace which helps it establish a personality of its own.

Logan Lerman returns as Percy son of Poseidon. Hes feeling restless and questless but that wont last When his school Camp Half-Blood is threatened by the rogue demigod Luke (an excellent Jake Abel) Percy must save it by finding the all-powerful Golden Fleece. With his friend Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario) and satyr sidekick Grover (Brandon T. Jackson) Percy will head into waters beyond even his fathers control. Along for the ride is a new character Percys sweet-natured Cyclopean half-brother Tyson (Douglas Smith). The cast lacks a certain spark but the actors seem to be settling into their roles. The films fantasy elements work well thanks to some imaginative special effects. The mechanical bulls that invade Camp Half-Blood are marvelously intricate and a rainbow-colored sea horse comes to life thanks to a clever visual touch -- water-drops that fleck the camera. Elsewhere though the film cheats Grover supposedly goat-legged and cloven-hoofed is never shown below the hips except in distant long-shots. Director Thor Freudenthal (""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"") and new writer Marc Guggenheim maintain the first films pop-culture humor The god Hermes played by Nathan Fillion tells us his tie is Hermes. The corny jokes almost come with rimshots but they help lighten the films heavy emotional backdrop of demigod children neglected by their parents. 230 MoviesPercy Jackson Sea of Monsters trailer ""Percy Jackson"" may always feel like a distant second to ""Harry Potter.""

(Photo Murray Close) By Jen Chaney August 6 2013 Follow chaneyj ""Percy Jackson Sea of Monsters"" the second film based on Rick Riordans immensely popular books about a dyslexic boy who discovers hes a demigod may make some moviegoers feel like theyve stepped into an actual Greek myth -- one that banishes them to the underworld for nearly two hours. Well maybe not quite the underworld since a trip down there presumably wouldnt feature droll quips from Stanley Tucci and Nathan Fillion who play small but enjoyable supporting roles in this desperately-trying-to-be-epic adventure. But even likable actors cant obscure the fact that holy gods on Mount Olympus this thing is a slog a movie that dutifully hits its plot points involving prophecies and fleeces without evoking a whiff of spirit or imagination. Its a shame that the millions of readers who fell in love with Riordans classic-meets-contemporary childrens stories have been handed such limp adaptations of the material. The first 2010s ""Percy Jackson amp; The Olympians The Lightning Thief"" -- directed by Chris Columbus who leeched some but not all of the life out of the first two Harry Potter movies -- was respectable but dull while ""Percy Jackson Sea of Monsters"" as directed by Thor Freudenthal (""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"") is both dull and awkwardly executed. Its less a theatrical release than a Disney Channel special that got dressed up in CGI clothes and was shoved into a multiplex. Like its predecessor this ""Percy"" sends its teen hero played by the likable Logan Lerman on a quest this time one that requires him to obtain the coveted Golden Fleece in order to restore life to a dying tree that protects Camp Half-Blood from evil forces. (Camp Half-Blood for those who missed the first movie or the books is the training facility/safe haven for offspring of one Greek god parent and one mere mortal. That includes Percy son of a human mom and Poseidon.) Operation Fleece Pick-up inevitably puts Percy and his band of Zeussian friends in contact with (duh) some massive beasts beneath the sea. It also briefly zips them through the District -- or rather Vancouver with a digitally inserted U.S. Capitol jammed in the middle of it -- in what qualifies as one of the most laughably inaccurate cinematic portrayals of our nations capital in the history of moviedom. The special effects look clunky and unrealistic whether they involve depicting the mammoth maw that is Charybdis or the single eye on the forehead of Tyson (Douglas Smith) a cyclops and half-brother to Percy who makes his first appearance here. Perhaps recognizing that the eye looks a little off (or lacking the budget to make it look on all the time) the filmmakers frequently mask it with a pair of sunglasses. The result the moppy-headed fellow son of Poseidon spends most of the movie looking like Brendan Fraser in ""Encino Man."" But even Tyson is more pleasant-looking than the cab-driving Gray Sisters (Mary Birdsong Yvette Nicole Brown and Missi Pyle) who also share a single eye but spew groan-inducing lines (""Oh no we didnt"") that confirm that even the attempts at comedy in ""Percy Jackson Sea of Monsters"" cant hit the right notes. Well thats not entirely true. Fillion gets the one genuinely funny piece of dialogue in the movie but its one that fans of his old TV show ""Firefly"" are most likely to get. Presumably they wont be coming to this movie. And in case this wasnt clear fans of the Percy Jackson books shouldnt bother either. Chaney is a freelance writer.

Jackson Leven Rambin Stanley TucciRated PG; Runtime 1 hour 46 minutes; Opens Wednesday nationwideHe may be a demigod but Percy Jackson is suffering a crisis of confidence.If this dilemma sounds familiar thats because it is. Percy is a lot like a certain bespectacled young wizard -- sans the lightning-shaped scar. Its too bad his adventures dont have the same enchanting quality.Percy Jackson Sea of Monsters (  out of four; rated PG; opens Wednesday nationwide) comes by the resemblance unsurprisingly since its executive producer is Chris Columbus director of the first two Harry Potter movies. Percy is the half-human son of Poseidon and the supporting cast of mythical-human teens features Hermione and Ron surrogates. Like Harry Percy tangles with computer-generated creatures some of whom are good -- an iridescent seafaring Hippocampus -- and some evil as in the fire-breathing metal Colchis bull.INTERVIEW Leven Rambin is masterfully mean in Percy JacksonREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersThis bland sequel to 2010s more entertaining Percy Jackson amp; the Olympians The Lightning Thief based on Rick Riordans book brings back three main characters Percy (Logan Lerman); Grover (Brandon T. Jackson) the mischievous satyr; and Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario) the daughter of Athena goddess of wisdom. New to the pantheon is Tyson (Douglas Smith) the half brother Percy never knew he had who also happens to be a goodnatured Cyclops.Percy has a nemesis in the form of the ultra-competitive Clarisse (Leven Rambin) daughter of Ares the god of war. She is one of the reasons Percy is not sure that hes still the hero he was in the first film. He saved the world then but could it have been a fluke?Meanwhile Luke (Jake Abel) the ostensible villain vies with Percy and his posse to retrieve the Golden Fleece which has the power to save Camp Half-Blood their home and training ground. But it cant fully save this uninspired action-adventure.STORY Leven Rambin Masterfully mean in Percy JacksonVIDEO Logan Lerman on the Selena Gomez crush SNEAK PEEK A first look at Sea of MonstersThe story opens with Percy and his pals performing feats of derring-do at Camp Half-Blood. One scene brings to mind The Hunger Games though the Potter vibe is more often palpable. Overseeing these sons and daughters of mythical gods are Chiron (Anthony Head) a centaur and the god of wine Dionysus (Stanley Tucci).Adult characters are responsible for a few funny moments. Zeus has cursed Dionysus so that every time he takes a drink of wine its turned into water. Tucci makes a comical quip about ""the Christian god who can do this only in reverse ... Now thats a god""Nathan Fillion is the movies brightest spot as Hermes re-envisioned as a UPS manager. He makes a quip about how the best TV series always get canceled in a nod to Firefly the iconic sci-fi show in which he starred.The saga gets points for attempting to illuminate the world of Greek mythology for young audiences but its too bad that the result is largely lackluster. 30 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 5 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1cFlBnzSummer Movies Calendar AugustTake a look at the films heading to the box office this August complete with trailers reviews clips related stories and more.

Fox Percy Jackson Sea of Monsters Director Thor Freudenthal Genre Adventure Family Fantasy Running Time 106 minutes Rated PG for fantasy action violence some scary images and mild language With Logan Lerman Alexandra Daddario Brandon T. Jackson (Recommended) Returning from sleep-away camp my teenage daughter whod hitherto declared reading a foreign pursuit announced that she was now a ""bookie."" Ruthlessly suppressing my inner jig I nodded casually and asked how this literary epiphany had come about. A cabin full of reader-girls it seemed had turned her on to Rick Riordans Percy Jackson series. And so it came to pass that over the next few weeks my child holed up at the library and indulged a burgeoning obsession with Greek mythology. So it was in a spirit of knee-bending gratitude that I took the teen to a screening of Percy Jackson Sea of Monsters the second (and to judge by its open ending far from the last) episode in a young demigods quest to rise to all manner of occasions. I havent read Riordans well-regarded novels and anyway these days most movie fantasies for kids -- stacked with souped-up special effects in place of character and story -- arent really my bag. Nor had I seen Chris Columbus Percy Jackson amp; The Olympians The Lightning Thief which blew away the box office but won middling reviews. So Im happy to report that Percy Jackson Part Deux is a fetching mix of whizz-bang CGI and full-blooded classical storytelling. Deftly directed by the gloriously named Thor Freudenthal (Diary of a Wimpy Kid) Percy Jackson Sea of Monsters brings back Logan Lerman who charmed our family to bits as a lovelorn sensitive soul in last years The Perks of Being a Wallflower. Here Lerman plays the titular son of Poseidon a busy guardian of the seas whose inattention has dropped his offspring in a heap of self-doubt despite his successful rescue of the world in the first movie. This time around Percys task is to rescue his home base Camp Half-Blood -- a homey little nature refuge that reads a bit like Hogwarts with more in the way of horned and hoofed creatures -- from fire-breathing mythical monsters. There is also a hard-bodied badass Luke (Jake Abel) who looks like a hedge-fund manager but is in fact the son of Hermes (Nathan Fillion) a messenger with a twist that will make you roar. i Wine god Dionysus (Stanley Tucci) is charged with protecting the resident half-humans -- though hes anything but fond of Percy. Murray Close/Twentieth Century Fox hide caption toggle caption Murray Close/Twentieth Century Fox Wine god Dionysus (Stanley Tucci) is charged with protecting the resident half-humans -- though hes anything but fond of Percy. Murray Close/Twentieth Century Fox Let it be said that the effects department had fun There are satyrs centaurs and Cyclopes both good and evil; there are friendly zombies and unfriendly bulls with animatronic scaly bits; and a wonderful abandoned amusement park crawling with alarming wildlife. The goofy bonus is Stanley Tucci as a rumpled bearded pedagogically suspect Dionysus constantly on the lookout for a cheeky little merlot. As if this werent adversity enough poor Percy plagued by insecurity must recover the Golden Fleece an innocuous-looking blankie with magical healing powers. As road trips go Sea of Monsters throws itself around at breakneck speed hurtling between Washington and Florida and through the scary waters of the Bermuda Triangle. Marc Guggenheims script is capable and funny but the films finest wit is vehicular. Theres a decrepit taxicab driven by three crones with but a single eye plus a water horse with the splendid name of Hippocampus who carries three fledgling heroes to a luxury yacht where Luke awaits loaded with Oedipal angst and bad intentions. If that were all Sea of Monsters would make a perfectly presentable boys own adventure yarn. But the movie doesnt slight the ancient lessons of the Greek myths which have much to offer the teenage heart searching for answers to questions like Who am I? Why must I sweep the hearth when the world needs saving? Why do I feel like crap when Im supposed to be a superhero? And by the way what are girls for? Answer Girls like Percys rival Clarisse (Leven Rambin) with tempers as hot as their lithe bodies are for fighting competing and using their brains. Theyre not much for romancing and in fact the real love story in Sea of Monsters is a slow-gathering bromance between Percy and his newfound half-brother Tyson (Douglas Smith). Like most teenagers the two are hybrids who each in his own way feels as if hes from another planet. ""We must create our own destinies"" says Percy as he prepares to surmount one challenge or another. Thats nice -- and very American-modern. The gods of yore bless their fatalistic socks are surely muttering beneath their fiery breath ""Good luck with that honey.""

Credit Murray Close/20th Century Fox Following the almost 226.5 million box office of the first Percy Jackson movie the hero (Logan Lerman) has returned to save Camp Half-Blood the training ground for Greek demigods and employer of the teacher-centaur Chiron (Anthony Head of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" at his Watcher-ly best replacing Pierce Brosnan). When the magical tree that protects the camp is poisoned Percy must retrieve the Golden Fleece to heal it.Tagging along with Percys buds Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario) and the satyr Grover (Brandon T. Jackson) is Percys half-brother Tyson (an appealing Douglas Smith) a shaggy Cyclops mocked by his peers. (Given the proclivities of their father Poseidon Percy and Tyson must have countless half-siblings.)Also chasing the fleece are Clarisse (Leven Rambin lending welcome astringency) the daughter of Ares and Luke (Jack Abel) the embittered son of Hermes back from the first installment who intends to use the fleece to revive the dreaded Kronos long-dormant leader of the Titans. The demis must traverse the Sea of Monsters (the Bermuda Triangle that is) to reach an abandoned amusement park the giant Cyclops Polyphemus and a Kronos resembling the walking volcano from ""Wrath of the Titans.""Regrettably absent here is Catherine Keener (as Percys mother) though Nathan Fillion (another ""Buffy"" alum) as Hermes has amusing moments. ""Sea of Monsters"" is diverting enough -- the director Thor Freudenthal (""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"") is savvy with effects and keeps his young cast on point -- but it doesnt begin to approach the biting adolescent tension of the Harry Potter movies. Are there hints of another sequel? You bet your gorgon.""Percy Jackson Sea of Monsters"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). If you cant handle the Titan lava get out of the kitchen.

Though this copycat franchise -- about a camp where the gods teenage spawn learn to harness their powers -- is still chasing the coattails of its wizard-world cousin Foxs minimal Stateside marketing push proves the studio is focused more on overseas returns where the original earned nearly 138 million.This story first appeared in the August 13 2013 issue of Variety. Subscribe today.See more. Looking old enough to be thinking about college Percy Jackson (Logan Lerman) is still horsing around with centaurs and satyrs at Camp Half-Blood where he has developed a rivalry with hyper-competitive Clarisse (Leven Rambin) clearly the heir to some of war god Ares more combative qualities. The hokey camp is protected from outside threats by a magical tree that Zeus created from the corpse of his fallen daughter Thalia (Paloma Kwiatkowski) just outside its gates -- an all-too-typical example of putatively classic storytelling updated to look wrong-headedly contemporary onscreen courtesy of TV-quality visual effects. Perhaps the most dispiriting aspect of the Percy Jackson enterprise (especially for those hunting for the next Harry Potter) is how little care the filmmakers take in trying to make this young-adult tale feel timeless. Instead of telling a story that will hold up even a few years down the road each installment takes age-old mythology and awkwardly pegs it to the moment all but guaranteeing that it will seem outdated by the time the next sequel rolls around. Here Percys telescoping sword already feels outdated as does the movies villain wayward demigod Luke (Jake Abel) the ""lightning thief"" Percy dealt with in the first movie. The plot involves Lukes attempts to summon Kronos and use the angry Titan (who looks like a videogame version of ""Legends"" Lord of Darkness) to destroy Olympus -- a scheme that mistakenly assumes that whoever resurrects Kronos can control him. One of the pics rare moments of inspiration comes in detailing Kronos backstory presented in an impressive sequence in which Percy perceives a stained-glass window come to life (not in the freaky ""Young Sherlock Holmes"" sense but as an elegant standalone animated interlude). Otherwise the overall vibe suggests ""Xena Warrior Princess"" as a Nickelodeon special as Freudenthal encourages the kind of clownish acting normally found on kiddie TV. Lerman seems especially awkward in this context having proven himself capable of far more serious and convincing performances elsewhere (including last years ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"") and already transitioning from his boyish looks to the face hell have in his 30s. The movie positions him as a lost kid seeking answers about his identity and fate from an unseen father but he doesnt appear nearly as young as his questions sound (""Ever felt that everything youve ever done is all just luck or something?"" he asks a nearby lake hoping Poseidon will answer). Percys already delicate self-esteem is thrown topsy-turvy with the arrival of Tyson (""Big Loves"" Douglas Smith) son of Poseidon and a sea nymph which makes this gangly new arrival to Camp Half-Blood his half-brother -- and a Cyclops to boot. Of all the sketchy special effects in the film none is more off-putting than Tysons lone eye which he mercifully covers with sunglasses for long stretches. That makes at least one character who doesnt have to suffer through 3D conversions of visually mediocre movies. The pic has better luck updating various other mythical monsters ranging from the fire-breathing Colchis Bull to fearsome sea creature Charybdis (which looks like the aquatic version of the Sarlacc pit). Still ""Sea of Monsters"" seems incapable of finding elegant ways to introduce these CG attractions into the story and instead comes across like a lazy bedtime story the narrator seems to be making up as he goes. Its enough to make Homer hang his head as the episodic film stumbles from one corny setup to the next operating on two shaky assumptions first that audiences remember the basics of mythology and second that theyll find it clever when the film name-drops classic characters in silly new situations. (Circes island becomes an amusement park the eponymous ""Sea of Monsters"" is revealed to be the gods name for the Bermuda Triangle and so on.) Its easy to forget this is a dead religion that novelist Rick Riordan and screenwriter Marc Guggenheim are mangling to fit the modern world though their flip treatment of the underlying legends begs the question how audiences might react if they attempted the same CliffsNotes-style riff on characters from the Old Testament or the Quran. Whereas the tale might have demonstrated the immortal appeal of Greek mythology it mostly just exploits the fact that its target audience is still being forced to memorize the gods exploits in grammar school serving up a quest thats modestly more entertaining than doing homework while completely missing the point about nearly everything it depicts.

Sarah says August 8 2013 at 1132 am I absolutely LOVE the Percy Jackson series and I thought that the Sea of Monsters was OK. Most of the things that happened in the book happened in the movie just differently e.g. They get gifts from Hermes Grover gets kidnapped Tyson ""dies"" and then comes to save the day Clarisse is the one to bring back the golden fleece etc. However they did leave out some important events that were some of my favorites in the book. Percy and Annabeth never went to Circes island and they never passed the sirens which I especially thought was something the film really skipped over. (Although this isnt saying much at all) it followed the book more closely than the previous film The Lightning Thief. Reply MagnetEdge says August 8 2013 at 752 am The movie wasnt that bad it was just different from its book counterpart. It wouldve made a good comedy movie but apparently that isnt the case. They tried to cover up for their inability to convey the serious sides of the story with jokes and I think thats what made the film so dull and light. But alas this movie was never meant for young adults and above. It was obviously aimed for children. And I think it did a splendid job at it. After all the first movie was the reason why I decided to read the books and was horrified when I found out how bad the film adaptation was. But it did get me in the franchise. Reply idishi6 says August 8 2013 at 414 am Just saw the movie. I am a huge fan of the books and I was utterly disappointed with the lack of essence in the films. It was a hodge podge of information taken from five books and mixed altogether in one film that half the movie made little sense. Trust me the books are well-written the characters are more dynamic and the myth/modern stuff is explained quite substantially. Both films were bad because they went against so much of the underlying themes. I hope future book adaptations will reconsider changing or condensing stories because historically that makes a big mess. Reply xerxes says August 7 2013 at 518 pm Fan girl talking here. I actually enjoyed the movie AND I have read the books..thrice. Some of the things you pointed out were true in a sense but you have to remember that the series is FICTION. If youre not happy with the way Rick wrote it then why not write your own? If your not cool with the movie why not direct/produce your own and well see how that goes? Just try to enjoy the movie as it is. Sheesh. Reply nici says August 6 2013 at 353 pm Listen some of us havent even seen this movie yet thanks for a bad review I hope that some day you will like a movie. Stop wasting our time reading a story that is much more boring. Reply Spencer Hastings says August 6 2013 at 241 pm As I cannot argue with anything youve said since I dont get to see it until tomorrow I think you underestimate how well this movie will do. Just wait. Reply Contessa46 says August 6 2013 at 157 pm The crappy CGI is compliments of India; way to go Fox Bring back the jobs to Hollywood you greedy bastards and then you will see outstanding CGI Reply ass says August 7 2013 at 536 am for your crappy consideration this is american CGI....so shut up Reply Jenny Jordan says August 6 2013 at 146 pm My goodness you can almost read this tools film-school-drop-out background in this sarcastic and pretentious ramble. Reply Serita Theresa says August 6 2013 at 156 pm I agree. I enjoyed the first movie and will probably enjoy this one. Reply Sranamare says August 6 2013 at 122 pm Thats great Variety. You just keep on slamming every movie that comes out it makes you look really important AND will lighten your workload over time by reducing the number of movies produced since nobody wants to see them anymore after your reviews. Bravo. On your way to retirement Reply Michael P. says August 6 2013 at 643 pm Have you seen the trailers? What makes you think the movie isnt as thin and slapdash as he decribes? Reply Dave Baxter says August 6 2013 at 141 pm I suppose the alternative is to just be a glorified arm of Hollywood PR and gush about everything. I prefer a bad movie be called a bad movie. It wont lighten the load of movies produced but it just might lighten the load of certain KINDS of movies being produced. And that wont be a bad thing.

TWITTER The Thor Freudenthal-helmed sequel lacks the energetic zip of its predecessor. The last time we saw everybodys favorite son-of-a-god he was on a quest to retrieve Zeus stolen lightning bolt in Percy Jackson amp; The Olympians The Lightning Thief. Some 226 million worldwide box office dollars later Percy and his fellow Half-Bloods have regrouped to track down the Golden Fleece somewhere off the Florida coast. Although mercifully coming in at under epic length the Thor Freudenthal-directed Percy Jackson Sea of Monsters which actually runs about 10 minutes shorter than its 2010 predecessor lacks the energetic zip of the Chris Columbus-helmed installment. It also struggles to nimbly balance that very evident Harry Potter-esque reverence with the loopier departures blended into the storylines of Rick Riordans series of best-selling books. Imaginative special effects sequences and the dedicated performances of its young cast should nevertheless help bring in some serious drachmas ahead of back-to-school preparations. PHOTOS Teenage Dreams 17 of the Most Popular YA Properties Adapted for TV and Film The start of the new odyssey finds Percy (Logan Lerman) the half-human son of Poseidon already racked with self-doubt over his demigod street cred further challenged by the discovery of half-brother Tyson (Douglas Smith) a teen Cyclops whose mom was a sea nymph. When Percy learns of a prophecy that could put all of Olympus in jeopardy he and his optically challenged sibling join forces with his trusted satyr pal Grover (Brandon T. Jackson) and Athena offspring Annabeth Chase (Alexandra Daddario) to track down the Golden Fleece before it falls into the hands of former lightning thief Luke (Jake Abel) who seeks it to resurrect the thoroughly evil Kronos. While Columbus who of course also directed the first two Harry Potter movies lent Lightning Thief  a briskness that goosed all that heavy Greek mythology incoming director Freudenthal (Diary of a Wimpy Kid Hotel for Dogs) working from Marc Guggenheims screenplay proves less successful in establishing a unifying tone. The cast give it their all and includes Leven Rambin (Hunger Games) as feisty Clarisse LaRue daughter of Ares the god of war; Anthony Head as Percys Centaur mentor; Stanley Tucci as Camp Half-Bloods hedonistic Mr. D (as in Dionysus) and a sardonic Nathan Fillion as a UPS store managing Hermes. But the true star of the show is once again the visually commanding if loud special effects sequences -- this time including one set in the Sea of Monsters (a.k.a. the Bermuda Triangle) and a grand finale featuring the towering Kronos.

Photo Everett Collection Like some hybrid beast out of Greek mythology this young-adult sequel has the body of a ""Harry Potter"" the head of a ""Twilight"" the feet of a ""Hunger Games"" and the tail oddly of a ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" Percy Jackson (Logan Lerman) knows from Greek myths because he is the son of Poseidon god of the sea. He and his friends are ""half-bloods"" a somewhat jarring moniker for having one immortal and one human parent. The teens attend a magical training facility that isnt Hogwarts at all (its lyrical name ""Camp Half-Blood""). Said camp is located in the piney misty forests of . . . not Forks Wash. but British Columbia. Very different look. Also drawing from the Potter playbook Percy has a doofy male best friend Grover (Brandon T. Jackson) and brainy female best friend Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario) and is informed by his teacher (Anthony Stewart Head sporting a horses hindquarters and possibly feeling that way about taking this part) that hes tasked with a grave quest. Itll be Percys second because in the first film (2010s ""The Lightning Thief"") he saved Mount Olympus. That was just ""beginners luck"" says Clarisse (Leven Rambin) a bitchy and competitive fellow camper whose braided hair and hunting attire evoke a certain Katniss Everdeen-ness. This time around Percy must get his hands on the mythical Golden Fleece to save the camp. He must get to it before Luke (Jake Abel) a disgruntled former friend grabs it for the purpose of reanimating Kronos Zeus abusive dad who long ago was broken into tiny pieces and magicked into an ark. Percy and Co. are joined by newcomer Tyson (Douglas Smith) another son of Poseidons who happens to be a Cyclops -- helpful as the fleece is guarded by the original one-eyed dude Polyphemus. Some questing ensues interspersed with a couple of amusing asides. That bafflingly fast barista at the coffeeshop? Hes secretly got eight hands they just look like two to our Muggle -- sorry mortal -- eyes. And Nathan Fillion gets in a fun five minutes as Hermes Lukes apologetic father who as the messenger god is naturally running the immortals version of UPS. Stanley Tucci (whos getting a lot of YA work these days) is a jaded Dionysus whose wine is forever being turned into water thanks to a curse. For the most part though director Thor Freudenthal (""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"") gives us a tiresome schlep from one 3-D CG set piece to the next interspersed with the most cardboard of dialogue -- which must have tasted especially bad to Lerman so heart-wrenchingly good in last years ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower."" The final insult is watching Luke tie up our heroes to poles in a dusty field while he unwisely prepares to open the ark which has magic swirling around it. Most tween Percy fans wont recognize this as a blatant rip-off of ""Raiders"" but I couldnt help wishing for a little face-melting at this point. You know the wrath of God -- or Spielberg.

Sure the effects are all computer-generated now but this franchise delivers the kind of silly all-ages fun thats appeared far too infrequently on the big screen since 1950s ""Hercules"" star Steve Reeves hung up his toga. For this second in a series of films based on the novels by Rick Riordan director Thor Freudenthal (""Hotel for Dogs"" ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"") takes over the reins from Chris Columbus but the ""Percy Jackson"" series still feels very post-Harry Potter not that it isnt entertaining on its own merits. If these daffy epics inspire kids to pick up Edith Hamilton and read up on the mythological figures who get name-checked throughout so much the better. Percy (Logan Lerman) having learned in the first film that he is the half-human son of Poseidon continues his training at Camp Half-Blood. (And just as an aside -- how vexed must these sons and daughters of Olympus be to know that wizards get a cool British boarding school while theyre stuck drinking bug juice at a summer camp?) See video Logan Lerman Explores the Bermuda Triangle in New Percy Jackson Sea of Monsters Trailer This enclave for demi-gods comes under attack when a protective tree -- actually one of Zeuss daughters long story -- is poisoned and thus unable to maintain the barrier that repels interlopers. After a foe from the past breaks through the invisible wall with a deadly mechanical bull its up to the campers to find the legendary Golden Fleece in the Sea of Monsters (known to us mortals as the Bermuda Triangle) to save the tree. Its not a great time for Percy to go a-wandering alas; hes feeling inadequate and like a ""one-quest wonder"" after his heroics in ""Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief"" and on top of that an oracle (voiced strikingly by Shohreh Aghdashloo) has told Percy that he will either save Olympus or destroy it. On top of that Percy soon learns that hes not an only child after all; seems Poseidon also had a fling with a sea nymph resulting in half-brother Tyson (Douglas Smith ""Big Love"") who happens to be a Cyclops. With returning pals Grover (Brandon T. Jackson ""Tropic Thunder"") and Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario) and new rival Clarice (Leven Rambin) Percy sets out to save the day prophecy be damned. The movies rib-elbowing jokes about gods existing under our noses get tired -- Nathan Fillion for example pops up as Hermes running the Olympian Parcel Service from inside a UPS Store -- but at least the screenplay by Marc Guggenheim (""Green Lantern"") takes the characters and their quest seriously even if we have to endure a Disney feel-good-ism or two. (""If you dont like your destiny"" one character tells Percy ""write a new one."") The cast is game from the slumming vets (Fillion Stanley Tucci Anthony Head) to the appealing youngsters led by Lerman who won an older fan base with his rich turn in last years ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower."" He makes for an amiable hero here able to command the screen even when hes surrounded by visual effects galore most of them having to do with wind water and mystical creatures. Guggenheim and Freudenthal keep the big set pieces coming from a trio of terrifying underworld cab drivers (Mary Birdsong Yvette Nicole Brown and Missi Pyle) to showdowns with sea monsters and a not-so-nice one-eyed distant relative of Tysons. In an age where even ""The Smurfs 2"" has to arch an eyebrow and pretend that its hipper than itself theres something refreshing about the lack of irony in the ""Percy Jackson"" series. Theyre the ideal matinee movies for an era that doesnt know what matinees are anymore. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Percy Jacksons friends urge the teenage demigod to change his destiny if he doesnt like how its playing out. Thor Freudenthal director of ""Sea of Monsters"" apparently missed the memo. ""Monsters"" is the follow-up to the Chris Columbus-directed ""Percy Jackson and the Olympians The Lightning Thief"" generally regarded as mediocre and derivative of Columbus earlier (and similarly mediocre) Harry Potter flicks. Twentieth Century Fox brought on Freudenthal (""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" ""Hotel for Dogs"") to do the second installment of Rick Riordans bestselling young-adult fantasy adventure series based on Greek and Roman mythology. Freudenthal succeeds in focusing on the characters and not overdoing the CGI stuff. The problem is that theres not much to the characters. Combined with a rushed plotline short on heart and laughs ""Sea of Monsters"" is lost by the time Percy and his pals get to what we humans call the Bermuda Triangle. Percy (Logan Lerman) son of Poseidon and a mortal mom needs to retrieve the Golden Fleece to save the poisoned tree that protects Camp Half-Blood. First he must vanquish a sea of mythological creatures pulled from ""The Odyssey"" and ""Jason and the Argonauts."" Theres also a gang of rebel Half-Bloods led by Luke (Jake Abel) son of Hermes who want to use the fleece to resurrect Kronos their Titan grandfather. Percy also is burdened by a prophecy that says his destiny is to save or destroy Olympus home of the Gods. Oh and theres a subplot involving a surprise half-brother whos part-Cyclops. Viewers older than 10 and unacquainted with the first movie or the books may be annoyed by the lack of context. Were not exactly sure why everybodys out to kill the kiddies at Camp Half-Blood or what the rebel Half-Bloods beef is or how exactly Poseidon conceived a Cyclops. The mythology is glossed over. When the gang arrives at the cave where the Cyclops Polyphemus guards the fleece Clarisse LaRue (Leven Rambin) points out the boulder Odysseus used to trap Polyphemus in ""The Odyssey."" The others stare back at her dumbly which makes Clarisse defensive about having read the myth. It wont exactly encourage kids to give Homer a chance. PERCY JACKSON SEA OF MONSTERS 1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG for fantasy action violence some scary images and mild language. Coming off ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" Lerman brings some authentic brooding and gentleness to Percy. Kids may also learn about tolerance and sibling love from interactions between Percy and his Cyclops bro (Douglas Smith). Otherwise the acting is mostly unconvincing. Clarisse picks on Percy with relentlessly forced sarcasm and hostility and Lukes dependence on a vacant stare makes you wonder why they couldnt have just created another computer-animated villain. Supporting actors Stanley Tucci and Nathan Fillion have a good punch line or two but otherwise the books humor fails to translate with both kids and their parents. It didnt have to be this way. If Fox is fated to adapt all the Percy Jackson books to film one hopes theyll find a director who can save the series from a bad ending. The Greeks called those tragedies.

Put a filmmaker with some wit in charge - Joss Whedon springs to mind - and the result could be a charming clash of cultures. Sadly no one involved with Sea of Monsters seems to possess much humour this is a witless heartless imagination-free slice of kiddy bait. We find our half-Greek-god hero (Logan Lerman) at a rustic summer camp for the cast-off children of Olympian deities - imagine an austerity-slashed Hogwarts. But when this mythic Butlins comes under attack from a pack of preening prep-school types Percy is forced to seek out the Golden Fleece. Theres really nothing to recommend Sea of Monsters the young cast are smug and forgettable; the action sequences barely get going before theyre over; and the whole affair is riddled with product placement and pop cultural references - one girl even seems to possess a magic iPad.

Here the myths are Greek the boy hero (Logan Lerman) is the half-human son of Poseidon the baddie is a blond rival demigod and the goal to recover the Golden Fleece from the Sea of Monsters (a.k.a. the Bermuda Triangle) while preventing the resurrection of the Titan villain Kronos. The specifics of Jacksons mission however are ultimately no more important than the themes about father-son bonds which director Thor Freudenthal dutifully trots out as a means of treading water between CG-enhanced set pieces involving badger-scorpion beasts and Transformer-like bulls. Despite the usual end-of-world crisis and Mount Olympus MVP characters theres no sense that anythings truly at stake; rather it feels as if the filmmakers are coasting on the fumes of teen-angst fantasy and making up their fairy-tale rules (Cyclopes are fireproof) as they go along.

BY Jordan Hoffman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Monday August 5 2013 419 PM Title Percy Jackson Sea of Monsters Film Info PG Fantasy action scary images. Area theaters. 3-D where available. Opens Tuesday night. To those who beseeched the gods for a sequel to ""Percy Jackson amp; the Olympians The Lightning Thief"" -- aka the Hellenic ""Harry Potter"" -- your prayers were heard. But as with most mythological stories be careful what you wish for. That first 2010 adaptation of Rick Riordans successful young adult book series had just enough crackle to make it worthwhile for teens. ""Sea of Monsters"" unfortunately is a clueless and bland follow-up featuring an uninspired quest and a startling amount of cheap-looking CGI. We open back at Hogwarts -- er sorry -- Camp Half-Blood where Percy (Logan Lerman) our wide-eyed son of Poseidon is living the young demigod lifestyle with whip-smart platonic gal-pal Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario) and doofus chum Grover (Brandon T. Jones). After an evil mechanical bull attack camp director Dionysus (Stanley Tucci trying his best to have fun with the part) agrees to send out a search party for a charmed Golden Fleece. Brandon T. Jackson Logan Lerman and Alexandra Daddario in Percy Jackson Sea of Monsters The first films director Chris Columbus -- not coincidentally the architect of the first two ""Potter"" flicks -- has spirited away replaced by Thor Freudenthal (""Hotel for Dogs""). Gone too is the supporting star power of the first film. Sean Bean Kevin McKidd and Steve Coogan (Zeus Poseidon and Hades) are discussed but not seen. Pierce Brosnan as the centaur Chiron is replaced by the less-interesting Anthony Head. Uma Thurman? Out. No-name accident-prone one-eyed Cy-klutz is in. The only highlights in ""Sea of Monsters"" are a stained glass-inspired animation sequence and relative newcomer Leven Rambin as Percys good-natured foil. Lively funny and PG-sexy Rambin best known as Glimmer from ""The Hunger Games"" has potential to grow into a true star. There isnt even an actual sea of monsters in ""Sea of Monsters"" unless you count some fish guts. The effects-driven moments we do see range from the competent to the laughable. Theres nothing golden -- but someones getting fleeced. Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.
