A minor turn in the torture porn cycle Untraceable pegs its scenes of calculated torment to a web-phobic police procedural plot that tries to do for cybersnooping what 24 did for enhanced interrogation. Diane Lane is an Oregon FBI agent investigating a website on which victims are subjected to fatal ordeals involving cement sulphuric acid and lawnmowers; the imaginative use of anticoagulants gives a whole new meaning to the term streaming content. The gimmick is that the more people click on the site the faster the victim dies making each of its users An Accomplice To Murder Such finger-pointing might - just might - come off a little more credibly if it werent interspersed with shots of bubbling skin necrotising wounds and water-tanks clouded with blood. Genre cliches arrive at broadband speed from the obstructive senior officer to the cute daughters interrupted birthday party.

John Bramley/Lakeshore Entertainment Group LLC hide caption toggle caption John Bramley/Lakeshore Entertainment Group LLC Detective Eric Box (Billy Burke) hunts an elusive serial killer in Untraceable. John Bramley/Lakeshore Entertainment Group LLC Director Gregory HoblitGenre Crime ThrillerRunning Time 100 minutes Watch a Clip This obnoxious little serial-killer epic features Diane Lane and Colin Hanks (Toms son) as FBI agents trying to find a creep whos trained a Webcam on people hes torturing. Media reports fuel a frenzy -- and the more hits the creep gets on his Web site the quicker the acid drips or the hotter the heat lamps burn. Were meant to be as appalled as the FBI agents are at the publics appetite for sadism while simultaneously feeling implicated for having attended a movie that exploits that appetite with wide-screen images of blistering skin and dissolving flesh. That sounds double-edged but it isnt really; despite reasonably taut direction from Gregory Hoblit Untraceable registers as little more than standard-issue torture porn - Saw 17 with a classier cast.

(Last week an Oscar committee disgraced itself and once again discredited the foreign-film selection process by eliminating this Romanian entry from the short list for an Academy Award.) Im not in the habit of invoking the subject of honors in the course of a review; normally thats a publicists job. But Cristian Mungius elegantly crafted brilliantly acted film set in Bucharest in the late 1980s near the end of the vile Ceausescu regime needs special help in finding the audience it deserves. That means an audience willing to go in with eyes -- and spirit -- wide open and to exchange the usual pleasures of entertainment for a dark unforgettable study of implacable evil personal responsibility and unintended consequences. ENLARGE The subject reveals itself gradually. Two young women in a college dorm Gabita and Otilia are preparing for a trip. Soap must be bought goldfish must be fed. ""Its like youre going camping"" Otilia says dryly. But the destination isnt a campground. Its an expensive hotel where Otilia the organized one has made arrangements for her frightened scattered roommate to have an abortion. (The title refers to the advanced stage of Gabitas pregnancy.) In the Communist Romania of the period abortion under any circumstances is a crime that carries prison terms for those who perform it submit to it or facilitate it. The underground abortionist here Mr. Bebe is played by an extraordinary actor named Vlad Ivanov. First hes portrayed as a convincing approximation of a human being -- laconic calmly methodical possibly competent a stickler for responsibility mutual trust and above all caution After the fourth month Mr. Bebe notes the crime isnt abortion its murder. When the arrangements he has insisted on go awry however the abortionist turns into a silent predator who destroys not just one life but in a chilling and unpredictable sense two. Silence has a significant role in the film much of which plays out at an audaciously -- and hypnotically -- slow pace The filmmaker and his cinematographer Oleg Mutu have staged several remarkable sequences with a quiet austerity reminiscent of the Japanese director Yasujiro Ozu. Its not like watching grass grow -- grass doesnt flourish in the bleak junkyard that the nations capital has become under Communist rule. Rather theres a sense of being able to watch thoughts form while the two young women consider their fate in the confines of their hotel room. And its a shared fate for Otilia having agreed to help Gabita pays dearly for her roommates irresponsibility. ENLARGE Anamaria Marinca Otilia is played by Anamaria Marinca an actress whose phenomenal performance comes to dominate the film which in its turn opens up into more than a drama about abortion. (Though its very much a drama about abortion depicting both the dire results of an outright government ban and the stunning reality of an aborted fetus.) Like ""The Death Of Mr. Lazarescu"" a 2005 film -- also shot by Mr. Mutu -- that portrayed Romanias health care system as mostly dehumanized and dysfunctional ""4 Months 3 Weeks and 2 Days"" evokes a nation suffering from economic and emotional stagnation. Black markets are the only flourishing markets. Service workers dispense disdain in lieu of service. Against this desolate landscape Otilias plight is all the more anguishing. Her worst crimes have been friendship and loyalty yet she finds herself running through nighttime Bucharest like a fugitive from justice afflicted by grief that may not be curable. In one of those Ozu-like sequences a stationary camera studies her as she sits in silence at a birthday dinner while others at the table talk cheerful small talk of Easter egg dyes and favorite recipes. In a pensive moment toward the end Otilia and Gabita reconnect at a table in the dining room of the hotel where guests at a wedding party dance on the other side of a windowed wall. Watching the two women watching each other doesnt qualify for a moment as entertainment but the movie is a window into their souls. Untraceable ""Untraceable"" doesnt qualify as entertainment either though its supposed to. This joyless thriller runs the gamut from unconscionable through unwatchable to unendurable. Its also unfathomable that two talented people Diane Lane and her director Gregory Hoblit got themselves involved in such an unpromising enterprise. ENLARGE Diane Lane (center) in Untraceable The subject is cyber crime -- the ostensible subject since the world of virtual vice is only an excuse for making a sleazy simulation of a snuff film. Ms. Lane is Jennifer Marsh an FBI agent assigned to chasing down criminals who operate on the Internet. Her quarry -- and eventually her tormentor -- is a serial killer with a supposedly untraceable Web site and a gift for exploiting new media. After kidnapping his victims-to-be he puts them on global display in streaming video tortures them in various grisly ways and then links the intensity of the torture to the number of hits -- the more millions of people who log on the sooner the victim dies. ""Any American who visits the site is an accomplice to murder"" says a grim-faced FBI techie. ""We are the murder weapon."" (What about Andorrans or Zambians who visit the site? Arent they culpable too?) Theres a moral of course -- a voyeuristic public gets the entertainment it deserves. But what have we done to deserve this? The only original idea is the bad guys ability to hack into a car computer. Maybe that will prompt the automobile industry to protect its products with passwords. Morgensterns DVD Tip The link between ""4 Months 3 Weeks and 2 Days"" and ""Alfie"" (1966) may seem farfetched but its real. The first and only time Michael Caines likable misogynist of the title displays anything resembling a conscience is after a lady friend undergoes a squalid abortion. The camera doesnt show the dead fetus as it does in the Romanian film but Alfie describes it to devastating effect.

Not only are two of the widest releases --Rambo and Untraceable-- predictable derivative and generic they are offensive and gruesome. Untraceable has traces of Saw Silence of the Lambs and Seven in its lineage but is a wan version of the same old tired serial killer story despite its updated milieu -- cyberspace. CLIP Get a clue into Untraceable Worse it is deplorable in its exploitation of torture porn. While trying to make a statement about the publics fascination with tragedy it revels in graphic violence. A sick techno-geek has fashioned a website called killwithme.com in which he features the gruesome murders of real people. The more hits the site gets the faster he kills. The FBI team investigating the cybercrimes is led by Diane Lane who does her best to inject a serious quality into this thankless role. Her character proves that you dont have to be twentysomething to be tough and gritty and outsmart a young killer. While its refreshing to watch a thriller driven by a smart middle-aged woman her widowed character makes some inexplicably stupid choices endangering her young daughter in her single-minded focus to catch the murderer. Lane is assisted by a likable Colin Hanks. Also on the case is Billy Burke last seen in director Hoblits previous film Fracture. He plays a particularly dedicated local police detective who teams with Lane to crack the case. What is most troubling is the way in which the movie tries to have it both ways. It touches on some intriguing ideas such as the role of the public as criminal voyeurs and what the anonymity of the Internet does to our humanity. It also rightly implicates the mass media for their fascination with mayhem and destruction. But then it indulges in tasteless and graphic exploitation of the violence it condemns. Watching the hideously inventive ways in which the sweet-faced serial killer (Joseph Cross) annihilates his victims makes us accomplices too. Its as if director Hoblit is saying ""Look see how terrible our voyeurism has become. But wow check out how cool and gross this is"" The plots twists and turns are obvious and telegraphed while the script is so mired in techno-babble that key lines are inadvertently funny. The attempt at addressing societal and cultural ills and probing the downside of the Internet is superficial at best. But mostly Untraceable feels sleazy and gratuitous.

"Untraceable Pointless horror | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesUntraceable Pointless horror In the opening scene of Untraceable a kitten is killed by a psychopath. We are spared any revolting details but its still a shocking sight and ordinarily Id be walking out of the movie at this point.By Philip MarchandMoviesFri. Jan. 25 2008Starring Diane Lane Billy Burke Colin Hanks and Joseph Cross. Directed by Gregory Hoblit. 100 minutes. At major theatres. 18A  In the opening scene of Untraceable a kitten is killed by a psychopath. We are spared any revolting details but its still a shocking sight and ordinarily Id be walking out of the movie at this point.Being on duty I remained in my seat for this thriller from Gregory Hoblit a veteran director of many a television cop show.At least I can inform the reader there are no more depictions of animal slayings in this film about an ultra high-tech serial killer. His victims are all full-grown humans if thats any reassurance.Article Continued BelowThe premise of the film is gruesome but plausible the serial killer kidnaps a victim and then invites Internet users to visit his website and see a video of his prey poised to die in an extremely unpleasant manner.The more visitors to the site the more gruesome the death. As the killer taunts one ""The whole world wants to watch you die - and they dont even know you.""Its the job of FBI agent Jennifer Marsh (Diane Lane) to find this ""piece of s---"" before he strikes again. Along the way - despite its immersion in an up-to-the-minute digital world and sophisticated visual direction -the movie faithfully obeys many of the hoary conventions of the movie thriller. One such convention is that the villain must be almost superhuman in his abilities. For this villain its a genius level in applied computer science and engineering.Another faithfully obeyed by Untraceable is that Marshs boss the FBI supervisor must be clueless. Surely somewhere in the real world there must be a competent FBI supervisor. Untraceable demonstrates once again how unnecessary it is for audiences actually to understand technical jargon.Viewers of Law and Order have no trouble tolerating legal gobbledygook while following the shows plot line and fans of Star Trek swallow all sorts of pseudo-scientific gibberish so viewers of this movie will no doubt accept it when Marsh says things like ""Hes got to be running his own bot net"" and then follows up that statement with a barrage of other computer terms.All that is acceptable. What is questionable is whether the filmmakers have any business placing at the very centre of the movie the big-screen equivalent of a wax museum torture chamber. Not that the movie doesnt attempt to justify this with a little dose of social criticism. The killer himself weighs in with a condemnation of our society and its cruel voyeuristic tendencies.""Soon executions will be delivered live on our televisions our computers our cellphones our handhelds - and it wont cost much more than 10 bucks"" the psychopath raves. ""Millions of eyes all watching Theyll have no trouble finding sponsors""These outraged comments are moral fig leaves like a movie with exciting battle scenes dressed up with an ""anti-war"" message. Theyre a way of saying its not just about pointless horror. But it is and in that sense its pornography. Scenes of torture are like sex scenes. They overwhelm the imaginative responses of an audience to such an extent its impossible to perceive any moral or emotional truth - supposing any such truth is lurking in the first place.

Email Print Share Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Del.i.cious Google+ Reprints Follow TIME Five reasons to hate Untraceable 1. It takes advantage of defenseless January moviegoers. I refer to those loyal souls who have assiduously seen all the late-year releases that are now bathing in Oscar-nominated glory and are looking for a weekend diversion that doesnt involve the Rambonctious Sly Stallone. They see Diane Lanes name on a movie called Untraceable and think it might be a thriller for adults an Unfaithful with a little murder on the side. What theyll get is Saw 4-1/2 another slice of movie gorenography this time with the patina of social comment. Lane plays Jennifer Marsh an FBI agent in Portland Ore. who tracks cybercrime mostly identity theft and porn downloads. A new site is different the work of a sickie who shows a kitten on the screen then shortly thereafter one dead kitty. This guy is smart deranged and even with all the resources at Marshs command untraceable. Even for a January splatter-fest movie Unpraiseable is spectacularly stupid. Toward the end the killer knows Agent Marshs identity and is out to seize fricassee and kill her. So her boss takes her off the case and tells her in effect get out of here; we wont have any cops guard you when you go through the rain at night alone and unprotected to the creepy motel room youve moved into. Apparently Marsh has an electric car because when she drives onto a bridge -- where there are no drivers to help her -- the killer is able to make it stop through remote control. 2. It plays into the sick myth of the brilliant serial killer. The evil genius with a sadistic streak who plays mind games with his victims and the police has replaced the criminal mastermind of old dime novels. Instead of tying the heroine to the railroad tracks (these days the train would never arrive) he straps them into Rube Goldberg contraptions that slowly rip their fingernails off and tear their dignity to shreds. We live in a cruel world but this is one area of criminality where fiction has long outstripped fact. According to the folks at Wikipedia -- and those obsessive list-makers have to be trusted here -- there have been 93 U.S. serial killers. Movies and novels topped that number ages ago merrily tapping into or creating the audiences fascination with diseased minds and the atrocities they can dream up. Lately virtually all serial killers are derivative of Thomas Harris Hannibal Lecter series and its spawn the Saw films where the killer is (1) gloriously nuts and (2) convinced he is wreaking divine vengeance on his victims. Hes meant to be pitied as much as reviled. In Unfaceable the killer -- revealed fairly early in the proceedings so Im not spoiling much -- is a young man (played by Joseph Cross) bereft over his fathers suicide and driven to punish those he believes responsible. Dont blame me blame society. Sadly this sympathy-for-the-devil tone permeates modern psychiatry it says that every kink can be traced to some genetic mistake or childhood trauma. Cant anyone in fiction or real life just be a bad person? 3. It exploits the sickness it supposedly condemns. The killers notion is to kidnap someone truss him up in a basement in front of a video camera and post the torture on his Internet site. The more people who log on to watch the agony the more the victim is tortured unto death. This allows the perp to think hes not the one killing his victims; its the viewers those sick voyeurs glued to their screens. They are voting for the victims painful death simply by watching in a sort of American Idol for sadists. The site is called killwithme.com. Go on click away; Ill wait. Hi welcome back. You saw the warning ""Visiting this site could cause harm to innocent people. Do you still want to enter?"" You said yes and saw this ""91% of you ignored the warning. Where are your morals?"" This is of course a site devised by Screen Gems the Sony subsidiary that produced Vacancy When a Stranger Calls and sequels to Hostel 8mm Sniper Resident Evil and I Know What You Did Last Summer. So Sick is pretty much the in-house genre and the superior moral tone of Intractable is just another twisted prank. The movie says were all rotten and weak for watching the very form of lurid stuff it put on the screen. But the people behind the film wont take responsibility for their artistic crimes. They say theyre not culpable for manufacturing and marketing this trash. No we are for paying to see it. 4. It stains the C.V.s of some fairly honorable movie people. The director is Gregory Hoblit who helped dream up the distinctive visual styles of the TV shows Hill Street Blues L.A. Law and NYPD Blue and directed the not-bad crazy-killer thriller Primal Fear (which introduced Edward Norton to film audiences). Two of the writers Robert Fyvolent and Mark R. Brinker are first-timers but the rewrite man (or in this case woman) Allison Burnett scripted last years saucy amiable Robert Benton movie Feast of Love. I know a buck is a buck if not nearly a Euro but I cant imagine what lured them to lend their talents to this enterprise. Our condolences to some fine actors. Colin Hanks Toms very promising son does decent work as one of the FBI agents but like so many other characters in the movie he has to play his last scenes tethered in torture. And we will not forgive Lastplaceable for making Lane -- at 43 a near-30-year veteran of movies and a fine natural actress who I wrote not long ago ""has never had an ungorgeous day in her screen life"" -- look run-down worn-out and generally kind of awful even when shes not hanging upside down above a threshing machine. Finally the movie turns Portland into a gray soggy monsoon city. I checked the citys official website and read ""Our average annual rainfall is less than that of Atlanta Birmingham Houston Indianapolis or Seattle."" Maybe everyone who logs onto the site makes it pour more. 5. It makes critics like me go shrill with condemnation. For movie distributors January is garage-sale or garbage-sale time; reviewers critical expectations are lower than usual. Were indulgent toward junk that deserves to go direct to DVD. We want to save our fulminations for later in the year and unleash them on failed films with bigger budgets and higher ambitions. But Untraceable really is disgraceable. Its bad enough when a movie offers up atrocity scenes that would make the Nanking soldiers seem like Hannah Montana; its repellent when the movie dresses up the sadism in a moral message that condemns the very weakness it is exploiting. Can we resolve to take a break from gorenograohy? For now enough of torture porn. Its time for tort-reform.

(AP Photo/Sony Pictures Entertainment) Photo John Bramley Review Untraceable - its worse than spam 1 / 2 Back to Gallery J Untraceable Thriller. Starring Diane Lane Billy Burke and Colin Hanks. Directed by Gregory Hoblit. (R. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) As plain awful as ""Untraceable"" is possibly the worst thing about it is that it pretends to mean something. Its supposed to be good for you. See theyre not showing you a series of grisly murders for nothing. Theyre not putting you through 100 minutes of an absurd story and dumbfounding dialogue just for their health. No this is for your health - a meaningful commentary on the excesses of the Internet. In the movies first seconds things get off to a flying start with the murder of a kitten. The murder takes place off camera but we see the meticulous setup and its well not fun. I thought they taught this in screenwriting school If you want people to like your movie (or play or TV show or novel or story or vacation video or bracing anecdote over cocktails) avoid opening with the torture death of a small furry animal. Not everyone will appreciate the artistry. Indeed some people will get so confused theyll suspect the movie isnt about a creep but that it was made by creeps. We soon discover theres a wacko out on the loose - isnt there always? - and he has broadcasted the kitten death live over the Internet. Whats more FBI cyber investigator Diane Lane cant figure out where he is. Hes ... untraceable. Hes done all this stuff - all this this Internet stuff you see - that nobody understands but he has all these firewalls and fake IP addresses. You just cant get to this guy Hes that good In fact he kills a person next. He doesnt say ""OK first a kitten lets try a chimpanzee."" He goes for the gusto by hooking a human being up to some arcane slow-death torture device. And then in a supreme act of innovation he hooks the device up to his computer. This is where the social commentary kicks in. Apparently the more people log on to watch this gruesome horror the faster the victim dies. Indeed if nobody clicked on the victim would go unharmed. Makes you think doesnt it? People are really sick. The preposterousness quotient is the least of this movies problems but its worth a glancing mention. The police and the FBI know the killer is in Portland Ore. He contacts people. He flaunts his crimes. If the FBI and local police really cant find him then someone is doing a heck of a job Brownie. But even if they cant locate him physically why cant they block traffic to his site? Why cant they scramble the broadcast? And if hes ""untraceable"" surely the people logging on to his site arent. There would be a way to stop this. But in ""Untraceable"" there isnt and so we get to see a series of murders all of them as creative as something a Bond or Batman villain might devise but a lot more graphic and with a lot more screaming. Lane has quite a role here. Her task in scene after scene is to look at a screen and register horror. The gradations of horror increase starting at anonymous-furry-creature horror and eventually graduating to oh-no-is-that-my-dear-friend horror. At least the movie never has her throw up though at one point she comes close. ""Untraceable"" was directed by Gregory Hoblit who made ""Primal Fear"" ""Frequency"" and ""Fracture"" all good films so this is his first bomb. The incandescent idiocy of the movie can be blamed on the screenwriters but Hoblit has to take some credit for the sheer ugliness of it all. -- Advisory Grisly torture sequences.

"Untraceable Streaming horror - Mercury News Hot Topics Big Sur fire Balloon crash No-parachute skydive Deadline 29 to Vegas Sheryl Sandbergs Option B Steve Torrence Ask Amy Comics SV150 Print Email Font ResizeUntraceable Streaming horrorDIANE LANE GETS CAUGHT IN WEB OF ONLINE MURDERER IN UNTRACEABLEBy Bruce NewmanMercury NewsPosted 01/25/2008 030251 AM PSTUpdated 01/25/2008 030251 AM PST ""Untraceable"" is the latest entry in an increasingly crowded field of torture porn movies although with Diane Lane as its star it gives itself away as soft-core porn. If they wanted the hard stuff they obviously would have gotten Jodie Foster. Like a lot of porn ""Untraceable"" is seductive. It sucks you in then later you feel like you need to take a shower. The story is driven along by an idea thats as ingenious as it is insidious A string of torture-murders is being streamed live on the Internet and the more people click onto the site the faster the killers helpless playthings die. The problem of course is that to play along with this plot conceit we have to watch what becomes a series of snuff films so we are both complicit in the horror and one step removed from it. As various instruments of agony are unleashed on the trussed-up victims a tote board counts the number of unique visitors who have logged on to watch. As the numbers spin upward faster and faster the torture increases. The first clue that the plot is going to revolve around a cat-and-mouse game between the cyber-killer and FBI computer crimes agent Jennifer Marsh (Lane) is the identity of the initial victim an actual cat who dies a slow grisly death streamed live on www.killwithme.com. (Psycho-killer qest-ce que cest?) Marshs partner in the Portland cyber-crimes unit is Griffin Dowd (Colin Hanks) and when he isnt prattling on about the blind dates he meets through the Internet he and Marsh are speaking to each other in computerese.Advertisement We hear a lot about ""black-holed IPs"" ""botnets"" and ""Trojans"" establishing their fluency in hackerspeak as we watch Marshs fingers fly across the keyboard at a rate previously attained by few humans. If youre paying attention ""Untraceable"" often seems to go out of its way to tip off whats coming so that its hard to tell whether the films writers are lazy clumsy or just painfully obvious. Many of these shortcomings are heaped on Dowd the sidekick whose anonymous Web hookups seem increasingly unwise as the death toll mounts - if not to him certainly to us. Dowd also remarks while watching one victim die in agony that if only the guy knew Morse code he could blink his location into the camera. What an interesting idea Wonder if itll ever come up again. In one early scene Marsh is stuck in a traffic jam and for no particularly good reason activates the OnStar system in her car. She gets directions from the disembodied voice of someone at OnStar who has been using a computer to track her location. Then she drives home. On its own this scene has so little merit that it invites suspicion that later somebody else - the killer? Vice President Dick Cheney? - is going to share an OnStar moment with Marsh. Sure enough when we get to one of the movies most thrilling scenes it is bisected by the pictures most ludicrous line of dialogue. In a panic Marsh calls detective Eric Box (Billy Burke) the cop shes been working with and screams ""He hacked into my car"" Not with a crowbar mind you. With a modem. Despite a trail of corpses with boiled skin the movie leaves behind the true villainy ""Untraceable"" seems eager to expose is the nerd mob of our collective nightmare the Internet. The Amazon dot-comming of murder. This subtext begins to feel a little preachy until at last the picture reveals both the identity and the motive of the killer and director Gregory Hoblit finds some by-the-numbers thriller moments to bring the movie home. Hoblit directed ""Fracture"" last year a crime thriller that was the cinematic equivalent of a good paperback mystery. But ""Untraceable"" is something far more lurid and far less mysterious. And in the end not much fun.

I wonder what patients of the doctor - a Houston orthopedic surgeon named Mark Brinker - will say when they see all the evil contraptions this guy dreamed up such as a series of heat lamps rigged to slow-fry a prisoner. (Er actually doc I think I dont need any more treatment from you. And please dont approach me with any sharp instruments.) As for the lawyer though Id hire the guy anytime. The movie starts with a cat being tortured to death and then introduces us to a Portland Ore. FBI investigator and caring mom (Diane Lane) who tracks online criminals. The cat killer did the deed while streaming the action on a Web cam but the agent finds that the wee beastie was only practice for bigger game. Soon the psycho is kidnapping humans putting them in torture devices and making them stars of his Web site. He arranges it so that each pain machine is linked to the number of viewers of his site. The more visitors the worse the torture until the victims as dead as the script around him. The doctor and the lawyer write dialogue about as well as I transplant kidneys. Characters actually say ""This time its personal"" ""Just when you thought youd seen it all"" and ""You think this is it? Its just the beginning."" Every so often the story veers off the thriller rails and into the parking lot of product placement for Windows Vista or the navigation service OnStar. Out of nowhere Lane says ""Make sure to send her mom an Evite"" and when the detectives have important matters to discuss they stand in front of a Pepsi machine. The victims share a connection that Inspector Clouseau would have figured out. Its not revealed until the end but the detectives seemingly didnt employ such techniques as asking what the deceased did for a living. When one victim disappears instead of looking at his computer and phone records and talking to his family to find out where he might have been going they publicize his plight. This (duh) causes surging Web traffic and certain death. The movie chides us for being a sick voyeuristic society hungry for the sight of violence. The purity of this moral stance is somewhat clouded by the movies habit of staging sick violent acts. Not that crowds are going to stampede the multiplex for this one. Whats the opposite of a voyeur? An ignoreur? UNTRACEABLE Unendurable. Running time 100 minutes. Rated R (torture violence profanity). At the Lincoln Square the Kips Bay the Orpheum others.

Tuesday June 3 2008 1111 AM The premise for Gregory Hoblits cyber-thriller ""Untraceable"" is traceable - to the misanthropic assumption that there are about as many sickos in society as there are personal computers.Were not talking porn surfers or even MySpace predators but people who would click on the Web site killwithme.com to watch live streaming of torture and murder. More than that they would do so knowing that by clicking on the site they would be adding to the suffering and hastening the deaths of victims. Hoblit a veteran of TVs ""Hill Street Blues"" and ""NYPD Blue"" is a skillful director of the police procedural and he adds to this one the creepy vibe of ""Silence of the Lambs."" Its an involving movie well-acted and fast-paced. But you may need a shower afterward. The reliably intense Diane Lane stars as FBI cybercrime agent Jennifer Marsh a single Portland Ore. mom who monitors the Internet for identity thieves hackers and other high-tech felons. When her screen suddenly fills with the words ""Kill With Me?"" and the live image of a kitten being tortured follows shes onto something grotesquely special. Over the next few days Marsh and her partner Griffin Dowd (Colin Hanks) watch helplessly as a kidnapped man replaces the kitten and is slowly bled to death thanks to an anti-coagulant drug that drips into his vein with each click of a new visitor to the site. If no one visited the man would live. But word-of-mouth travels fast in ghoul-land and millions are soon connected instant-messaging their excitement as the victim succumbs. There will be other victims before Marsh and her team figure out whos doing the killing and why and where hes doing it. I wont say more except that its personal for Marsh. I like the idea of a cybercrimes agent cracking cases through superior knowledge of the Internet. Marsh could be a great heroine for a continuing series. But ""Untraceable"" essentially forces its audience to identify with those who would be willing accomplices to torture and murder. To understate the point thats not an audience-friendly approach.

By  Lisa Kennedy PUBLISHED January 23 2008 at 200 pm | UPDATED May 7 2016 at 758 pm Sign up for newsletters and alerts Submit your news tips or photos Most Popular Donald Trump stumps in Colorado promises ""No more Mr. Nice Guy"" Chris Harris INT injuries and 8 other observations from Day 2 of Broncos training camp Broncos offensive line can live with the blame game. Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Its hard not to admire the woman who grabbed her parka and headed out of a recent preview of the thriller ""Untraceable"" during the climax. By then a garden rototiller -- we had been shown oh-so-subtly earlier -- was revving for a slaughter. And our Penelope was in deep peril.  RATING | Thriller Its not that this film about the hunt for a Portland serial killer who streams his handiwork on the Web is especially egregious. The ever-watchable Diane Lane brings believable single-mom weariness to Jennifer Marsh an FBI cybercrime agent. Colin Hanks -- yep of that bloodline -- is likable as Griffin her colleague in keyboard sleuthing. And director Gregory Hoblit is known for delivering diverting thrillers that often contain fine even breakout performances ""Primal Fear"" with Edward Norton; last years ""Fracture"" with Ryan Gosling. Joseph Cross turn as the smug efficient killer isnt in that league. But by the time the movie pits Marsh against killer Owen Reilly the murders have taken their toll and the presumed moral of a cynical script (written by Robert Fyvolent Mark R. Brinker and Allison Burnett) has been smothered by the cruelty. Reilly Tasers his victims then hitches them to lethal contraptions. If youre thinking ""Saw"" then you know what Ive seen. The hook here is that hits from the online community decide the fate of the victims. In an indictment of the cravenness of some cybersurfers each new murder amasses larger audiences. Reilly blocks access to his killwithme.com site so that only Americans are viewing. A communal blog runs next to the video cheering on or commenting on the action. At one point Reilly pontificates about audiences and their (our?) thirst for snuff video. Its just so much blather his but also the films. As often happens when the middle-of-the-road flicks pass judgment on other forms of media the tale loses its bearings. Learning Reillys motivation is meant as a thoughtful twist. Its merely twisted. The film teases and unnerves for 100 minutes with scenes of cold brutality. Then in a rush to the end it tries to make it all better or at least make it more complicated. Any comparisons with the female heroics of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" are misleading. Unlike Reillys online viewers we may find ourselves bedeviled by the question ""What have we just participated in?"" Having waded long enough in the muck the departing moviegoer mentioned above probably wasnt worried there would be no resolution to ""Untraceable."" She just knew that as much as we might cheer on agent Marsh she couldnt make up for all the nastiness that had come before. Lisa Kennedy 303-954-1567 or lkennedydenverpost.com ""Untraceable"" R for gruesome violence and language. 1 hour 40 minutes. Directed by Gregory Hoblit; written by Robert Fyvolent amp; Marl R.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr (John Bramley) B- Untraceable Genre Mystery and Thriller; Starring Billy Burke Diane Lane Colin Hanks; Director Gregory Hoblit; Author Mark Brinker Robert Fyvolent; Release Date Wide 01/25/2008; Runtime (in minutes) 101; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Screen Gems Inc. Posted January 28 2008 -- 1200 AM EST Is Unfaithful and Under the Tuscan Sun star Diane Lane just randomly picking movies that start with the letters U and N? On this evidence quite possibly. She plays a widowed cybercrime-investigating FBI agent on the trail of a creep who kills people in various grisly ways and broadcasts it live over the Internet. The twist? The more people who log on to the sickos website the quicker the victim bleeds out/fries to death/becomes the piquant seasoning in a sulfuric acid soup. Thats right -- the real perp is you (or possibly YouTube). Then the homicidal maniac hacks his way into Lanes computer and her own life is put at risk as are the lives of her predictably cute daughter and mom. Lane skillfully sells the tech-heavy script. But after a much-too-early reveal of the murderers identity the ""low battery"" signal starts to flash on this film by thriller specialist Gregory Hoblit director of last years far superior Fracture. Moreover it seems a bit rich to criticize the publics appetite for watching grisly images while serving up scenes of torture porn that in terms of visceral horror come close to rivaling the nastiest moments of the Hostel or Saw franchises. The hypocrisy is well undeniable.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint If the makers of ""Untraceable"" had paid attention to the script they were filming they might have argued themselves out of making the movie. The story is an FBI procedural about agents on the trail of a serial killer who broadcasts the death throes of his victims on his website. The more viewers who click on to watch the faster the subject dies. Naturally the site becomes a huge hit with thousands of voyeuristic observers becoming accomplices in the atrocities. Did no one notice that ""Untraceable"" reenacts its villains crime creating a pay-per-view torture chamber and enticing us to take a peek? It would be good to shrug off this film as an unwatchable mess but sadly it is the work of skilled actors and a proficient crew. Its technically polished handsomely photographed and skillfully edited. Morally however ""Untraceable"" is indefensible. And that causes it to miss its mark. It aims to terrify but it left me feeling just heavyhearted. Everyone working on the project is overqualified for the job; the cast is headed by Diane Lane Colin Hanks and Mary Beth Hurt. Yet torture porn is all that Hollywood offers these talented entertainers. Lane plays Jennifer Marsh of Portland Ore. a federal agent and single mom to a young daughter. Jennifers team usually concerned with garden-variety cybercrime and identity theft stumbles onto something more unusual and unsavory when they discover a kitten about to be zapped on a site titled KillWithMe. The agents laugh it off as an outrageous hoax until a struggling gagged man is murdered on streaming video. The killer is operating in Portland exact whereabouts unknown picking off citizens seemingly at random. In fact in an elaborate scheme that could have been drawn from an Agatha Christie drawing-room mystery the killer is choosing targets linked by an event they would never suspect. As Jennifers pursuit of the evasive killer heats up he turns the tables moving ever closer to Jennifers colleague Griffin (Hanks) and even her daughter. Director Gregory Hoblit knows how to build tension; he brought to the screen the sleek courtroom dramas ""Primal Fear"" which made a rising star of Edward Norton and ""Fracture"" co-starring Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling. Such is his command of film technique that even when a character does something absurd Hoblit keeps you wrapped in the storys web. But this movie wasnt made to tell a story of suspense. The cornerstones of ""Untraceable"" -- its reasons for existing -- are protracted scenes of misery and mutilation. An acid bath heat lamps and blood anticoagulant gradually snuff out agonized victims before KillWithMes video cameras. What professional polish is lavished on this parade of brutality. The film gives us artfully composed closeups of bloody flayed flesh skin broiling and scorching eyes bugging in torment. Im sure the makers of the movie would call it a provocative condemnation of mans capacity for voyeurism and cruelty. Im sure I wouldnt believe them. ""Untraceable"" is unethical a tawdry serving of sadism in the guise of a morality tale. The script wags its finger at us -- accomplices once removed -- for enabling the murders. Lets take that message seriously and move on lending our support to something more uplifting.

"Untraceable Snared In Its Own Sordid Trap washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On >> This StoryRead +| Comments Movies Untraceable Snared In Its Own Sordid Trap Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday January 25 2008 Diane Lane may be the single best reason for adults to keep going to movies these days embodying not only the glamour and sexiness of an old-school movie star but also somehow the mellow slightly careworn seasoning of an ordinary middle-aged woman. This StoryMovies Untraceable Snared In Its Own Sordid TrapUntraceable Showtimes Those qualities are very much intact in ""Untraceable"" in which Lane plays a cyber-crime expert with the FBI which makes her presence in the film all the more painful. An otherwise slick well-crafted police procedural ""Untraceable"" dabbles in the kind of torture porn that has made movies like ""Saw"" and ""Hostel"" such hit franchises with the very teenagers Lanes career has so triumphantly defied. There are two movies to talk about in ""Untraceable"" one of which is very good. That one stars Lane as Jennifer Marsh a widowed federal agent living in Portland Ore. with her mother (Mary Beth Hurt) and 8-year-old daughter (Perla Haney-Jardine). She works nights so she can spend more time with her daughter and also because thats when her cyber-criminal quarries seem to be most active. She and her cheerfully geeky colleagues bait and trap pornographers pedophiles and fraudsters with the high-fiving enthusiasm of kids playing Super Mario Bros. Director Gregory Hoblit populates ""Untraceable"" with a terrific supporting cast of fresh faces including the hugely appealing Colin Hanks as Jennifers best friend and sidekick Griffin and Billy Burke as a Portland police detective with whom she shares a frisson of attraction. The entire production is skillfully and tastefully executed with Portland providing a refreshing visual backdrop and the action -- which could have amounted to a stultifying montage of computer-screen close-ups -- moving along at a crisp engaging clip. With its dialogue laden with references to Evites TTLs IPs and botnets and its spot-on depiction of the boneheaded ""comments"" that pass for discourse on the Web Hoblit provides a vivid atmospheric portrait of a contemporary media culture whose greatest literary achievement is ""LOL."" But from its very first scene (lets just say theres a kitten involved) ""Untraceable"" isnt the sophisticated brainy thriller it so nearly could have been but just another movie about a serial murderer in this case a deranged computer whiz who kidnaps people drags them to a basement and then tortures them uploading the images to a Web site called ""Kill With Me?"" The more people who log on the faster the victim dies whether by bleeding to death being burned while encased in cement or dunked in a vat of battery acid. These gruesome graphic images which Hoblit splices into ""Untraceable"" just often enough to provide what studios once called ""wammies"" provide a sick even depraved counterpoint to the relatively classy production going on around them and the filmmakers intent is clear to indict a culture drunk on images and desensitized to their meanings. (Lanes character pointedly compares the fans of ""Kill With Me?"" to the people who logged on to watch the video of Daniel Pearl being murdered.) As ""Untraceable"" descends into progressively more perverted territory -- and as Jennifer becomes personally more endangered by the sickos hacking expertise -- it begins to practice the very hypocrisy it condemns engaging in the rancid voyeurism it pretends to abhor. The final showdown is the kind of preposterous Hollywood cliche that would be right at home in Robert Altmans classic satire ""The Player."" Through it all Lane hits her marks with signature insight and professionalism which only proves that she deserves much better than this grim grisly joyless production. Untraceable (100 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for some prolonged sequences of strong gruesome violence and profanity. >> This StoryRead +| Comments (c) 2008 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends Activity View More Activity  Untraceable Snared In Its Own Sordid Trap Untraceable Showtimes",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/24/AR2008012402997.html,200,untraceable21,untraceable,washingtonpost

Its difficult to know whether you should praise or punish a movie for feinting toward social relevance and falling woefully short. Its a case-by-case basis for the most part. And in this case Untraceable deserves to be punished. Although it gives lip service to intriguing social issues - the deleterious effects of the media the power of the Internet the danger of group think - it never follows through. Instead its lazy ridiculous and not much better than the torture porn at the center of its story. Diane Lane stars as Jennifer Marsh an FBI agent who spends the night shift catching cyber criminals most of whom are teenagers stealing credit-card numbers to buy cheap porn. Then a tip leads her to Watchmekill.com a site that streams live video of a cat being starved to death. (Yes there is such a site and yes its related to the film. Untraceable might be stupid but the people who market it are not.) Its a disturbing sight yes but hardly worth the FBIs time Marshs boss figures. But soon the site is showing a man being tortured with a twist the more people who visit the site the faster the man dies. Now thats intriguing. It could be the jumping-off point for all kinds of social examination. Would you click? Could you stop yourself? If the victim dies - guess how that turns out - are you responsible? Marsh has her answer. When a cop calls visitors to the site ""fans"" she says ""Dont call them fans. Theyre accomplices."" Marsh makes her case but the movie doesnt certainly not with any passion. Its more interested in being a by-the-numbers - low predictable numbers - thriller than it is in being anything deeper. This is exacerbated by some bad acting much of it surprisingly from Lane. Shes not helped by having to spout all manner of technical jargon little of which she pulls off convincingly. Colin Hanks provides a bit of spark as an agent always on the lookout for an online date but Billy Burke as a detective working the case is so inert he should hide from woodpeckers. The storys no better. It wanders from one cliche to the next. And because Untraceable doesnt have the courage of its convictions - namely to look at the bigger picture - it eventually devolves into a standard-issue thriller with Marsh herself in jeopardy. Why not? Shes a single mom with an adorable daughter (Perla Haney-Jardine) and a spunky mother (Mary Beth Hurt) and toward the end of the film Marsh makes so many stupid scary-movie decisions she should have ""Me next"" tattooed on her forehead. Theres a good movie to be made about the power of the virtual mob the ethical consequences of participating in it the costs of free will. But Untraceable isnt it not by a long shot.

"Untraceable | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; untraceable ) Untraceable (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli Untraceable engenders a reaction that is one part fascination one part disappointment and two parts frustration. The film which has the ingredients for a thoughtful tense thriller throws away a compelling first half so it can descend into silliness and clichA(c)s. For a movie that works overtime to establish credibility during its first half-hour Untraceable leaves no predictable formulaic stone unturned in its rush to a jaw-droppingly stupid conclusion. Its almost as if the filmmakers who made the first two acts were replaced by Uwe Boll collaborators for the final 40 minutes. Then again its possible to believe this of director Gregory Hoblit who achieved something not dissimilar with his previous feature Fracture. At the core of Untraceable lies a moral question If a man is being tortured and killed on-line and you know the URL where the streaming video can be found would you visit the website? Furthermore how would your decision to type in that address be impacted if you know that the mans death is hastened based on the volume of the sites traffic? Considering the dynamics of web surfing and the kinds of sites that can be unearthed the answer is not straightforward. I have never visited a snuff site but they exist and in some communities they are popular. It doesnt take much expertise to locate a copy of Daniel Pearls execution. On-line seek and you shall find no matter what it is youre looking for. Untraceable opens with a cruel and heartless video stream a kitten starving to death after being ensnared in one of those sticky rat traps. (This scene alone will be enough to cause some viewers to leave the theater. It is not graphic but is extremely disturbing for cat lovers.) The name of the website is Killwithme. It shows the progression of the kittens dilemma from when it is caught to when it dies. FBI agent Jennifer Marsh (Diane Lane) and her partner Griffin Dowd (Colin Hanks) who work out of Portlands cybercrime division watch this situation with growing horror but there are other human-related situations that require their attention. Then a week after the cats demise Killwithme ups the ante by depicting a human being tortured. Hes trapped in a set-up thats designed to end his life. The more traffic the site gets and the faster the traffic comes the quicker he dies. Local cop Eric Box (Billy Burke) becomes involved in the case and he and Jennifer pool resources to stop the serial killer. But hes smart and has figured out a way to make his website untraceable and impervious to attempts to remove it. The rumor of its existence catches fire and soon its one of the hottest Internet stopovers. With Untraceable its possible to be duped by the premise and the methodical manner in which the early portion of the film sets everything up. For a while the film is compelling in much the same way that a picture like Seven is compelling. However when the movie decides to make the threat more ""immediate"" the script becomes awash in contrivances and clichA(c)s. The manner in which the killers identity is discovered is patently absurd although it is telegraphed in the first twenty minutes via one all-too-obvious line of dialogue. (Hmmma| I wonder why he said that?) The climax which is the result of the protagonist thinking shes in a horror film and therefore doing one stupid thing after another is so asinine as to be almost laughable. Its doubtful the directors intent was to provoke derisive chortles. The films nearly fetishistic obsession with inventive deaths recalls Saw although there are substantial differences. Untraceable seeks to be categorized as a thriller while Saw prefers the horror genre but there are similarities in the ways the movies view death as part of a game between cops and a twisted mastermind. Both films have moral statements to make and their conclusions about human nature are similar. If one is looking for an optimistic perspective of what it means to be a member of this race The Bucket List would be a better multiplex option. Its a little surprising to find Diane Lane in such grim grotesque circumstances. She is after all known for gentler fare. Maybe she didnt read the entire script and was seduced by the veneer of intelligence the early pages exhibit. Or maybe she just needed a paycheck. The supporting cast is effective although relatively small. Colin Hanks has inherited a portion of his fathers likeability and Billy Burke has the perfect square jaw for his part as the extraneous cop/pseudo-love interest. The fact that the movie seeks to implicate the audience in the crimes by proxy is an interesting approach and it makes watching Untraceable uncomfortable. With a better screenplay this could have been an unsettling motion picture - the kind that causes viewers to leave the theater shaken. Instead however because of poor choices by the filmmakers the moral questions are shunted into the background and the only thing ""shaken"" as the end credits roll are viewers heads - shaking with dismay.

Unfolding like a better-than-average episode of a first-rate TV police procedural ""Untraceable"" is a satisfying slice of solidly crafted meat-and-potatoes filmmaking. Diane Lane heads a cast of thoroughgoing professionals who breathe a fair degree of fresh life into stock characters and the formulaic plot is enlivened with bracingly acerbic observations about Internet-enabled voyeurism. Aggressive marketing -- and a fortuitous lack of similar product in the marketplace -- may enable this latest thriller from helmer Gregory Hoblit ( ""Fracture""""Primal Fear"") to draw genre fans to megaplexes before pic begins a long life on vidstore shelves and cable network playlists. Working from a script credited to Robert Fyvolent Mark R. Brinker and Allison Burnett Hoblit (whose early experience as a director on ""Hill Street Blues"" and ""NYPD Blue"" serves him well here) focuses on the crime-busting activities of an FBI cybercrimes unit in the bureaus Portland Ore. field office. Usually special agents Jennifer Marsh (Lane) a widowed single mother and Griffith Dowd (Colin Hanks) her younger nerdier partner set their sights on sexual predators and credit-card scammers. But the stakes are raised when they discover someone on the Web has developed an attention-grabbing killer app. The anonymous psycho behind killwithme.com starts out small trapping a kitten and promising to kill the cat once his ""untraceable"" site gets a sufficient number of hits. When the maniac Webmaster makes good on his promise Marsh assumes its only a matter of time before human victims are placed at risk in live downstreaming videos. And sure enough the psycho lives down to her worst expectations rigging torture devices that grow increasing painful and eventually lethal as millions of voyeurs worldwide click on to watch the real-time action. Alert auds will note just how rigorously Hoblit and his scripters adhere to the law of Chekhovs gun If you introduce a firearm in the first act you must use it in the third. While watching a victim writhing in agony on killwithme.com someone notes that it would be great if said victim could blink Morse code directions to his whereabouts -- suffice it to say that blinking then figures into the plot in a way of which Chekhov would approve. Unfortunately the filmmakers shoot themselves in the foot and leave a gaping hole in their narrative by not revealing the ultimate fates of two key characters during their otherwise effective wrap-up. Given the serial killers ingeniously grisly means of dispatching his captives -- acid baths megawatt sun-lamps etc. -- and the prevailing atmosphere of impending doom in a rainy Pacific Northwest setting ""Untraceable"" cannot help but invite comparisons to ""Seven."" New pic is hardly in the same league as David Finchers influential thriller but it does keep the aud consistently discomforted -- in all the right ways -- while sustaining interest and maintaining suspense. Lane strikes the perfect balance of resourcefulness and sensitivity in a quietly forceful performance that efficiently propels the action. Billy Burke lends strong support as a Portland cop who aids in the investigation -- wisely the filmmakers avoid the obvious while developing his relationship with Marsh -- while Joseph Cross is both oddly compelling and formidably creepy as the Webmaster from hell. Other standouts in the supporting cast include Mary Beth Hurt as Marshs mom Perla Haney-Jardine as Marshs young daughter and Hanks as the FBI agent who goes looking for love in all the wrong places. Credit lenser Anastas Michos for making Portland look and feel like a moody gloomy place where the worst things can happen at any moment. Other tech credits are pro.
