A similarly sozzled Kevin Costner pitches up one day to discuss the sale of a vacant lot adjoining their upscale Detroit properties and soon this ex-baseball star now scuffing along on local radio is spending a lot of time there. He may be just what she needs or the last thing she needs - if she ever says sober long enough to work it out.This serio-comic rumination on lifes skewed learning curve deserves some credit for leading with a couple of flailing insecure not all that likeable characters showcasing excellent work from Allen (one of the great screen drunks) and Costner (uncommonly persuasive playing against type). Theres spiky humour and ample breathing room for the material yet the movies rather too intent on parading its own wisdom. Given the catastrophic final twist and a cloying voiceover explaining the point of it all perhaps such smugness wasnt such a great idea after all.

Nicely mounted and engagingly acted by an attractive cast led by the exemplary Joan Allen Mike Binders femme-dominated domestic drama hooks the viewer immediately. New Line should expect respectable theatrical B.O. ""The Upside of Anger"" takes a surface look at the life-changing potency of the fury felt by an abandoned spouse. Nicely mounted and engagingly acted by an attractive cast led by the exemplary Joan Allen Mike Binders femme-dominated domestic drama hooks the viewer immediately and is flecked with enough bitterly comic touches to make this an easy-to-digest variation of an angst-ridden tale. But pic increasingly exhibits a desire to amuse and distract rather than go deep which ultimately generates disappointment in light of its announced intentions. New Line should expect respectable theatrical B.O. upon March 11 release and better than that in subsequent home viewing markets. Narrated by one of the main characters four teenage daughters tale finds suburban Detroit housewife Terry Wolfmeyer (Allen) in a brittle alcoholic funk after the abrupt departure of her husband who she tells her girls left them for his Swedish secretary. Her mood hardly helped by incessant listening to immediate post-9/11 news reports Terry is joined in her daily drinking and smoking by neighbor Denny (Kevin Costner) a former baseball player with little to do aside from hosting a local radio talkshow. As uncomplicated and genial as a golden retriever Denny good-naturedly swills Bud all day long; he may have long-range ambitions to get into Terrys pants but he doesnt push it and she could do worse for mindless companionship. Terrys daughters are another matter. Eldest Hadley (Alicia Witt) is off to college and none-too-soon as far as shes concerned to escape the domestic pressure cooker. Emily (Keri Russell) is upset her mother doesnt take her balletic aspirations seriously. Unsurprisingly it is the most overtly sexual of the quartet who causes the most trouble for mom. Announcing she has decided not to go to college Andy (Erika Christensen) accepts Dennys offer to interview for a job at the radio station. Not only does she get a (nonexistent) job but she soon lands in the bed of Dennys producer Shep (Binder) which infuriates everyone who lays eyes on the crass and unkempt middle-age hustler (Andys age goes carefully unmentioned). Then theres the youngest 15-year-old Popeye (Evan Rachel Wood) a girl with literary pretensions who with rather startling bluntness tries to jump-start a relationship with a new boy in school by offering to have sex with him only to be rebuffed when he claims to be gay. With all these hormones bouncing around Terry decides to get into the act practically inevitably with Denny which given his amiably bland personality doesnt effect their relationship much. This along with Binders increasing interest in the intimate lives of the daughters prevents the drama from developing in compelling ways where Terry is concerned which leaves it up to Allen to dig down into her seemingly inexhaustible supply of variations on how to convey degrees of rage disgust self-loathing contempt and agitation. Maintaining a level gaze and an elevated talent for articulation no matter how much shes drunk Terry is redeemed even at her lowest ebb by an awareness of her own ridiculousness her surprise at the predicament shes in. Right at the outset Popeye insists how funny her mother used to be before the roof caved in and Allen is especially good at conveying how embarrassing Terry knows she is especially while drinking. She also sparks well with Costner who does very nicely here in what is essentially a self-effacing character role. Unaccountably shot in England but never less than fully convincing as upscale U.S. production is glossily decked out in all respects. One surprise is a score that not only is the first disappointing one from Alexandre Desplat (""Girl With a Pearl Earring"" ""Birth"") in recent times but one that makes the film seem more conventional and emotionally simplistic than it is. Teen actresses are fine without too much range being demanded of them. But one can only wonder about the motivations behind Binders writing himself such an obnoxious part. The former stand-up comedian has played unsympathetic roles before but here hes an entirely loathsome cretin most of whose dialogue consists of defensive rationales as to why its a good thing that he sleeps with teens less than half his age.

We are treading water in a mental puddle of perfect oblivion. We are having fun. Or are we? In ""The Upside of Anger"" an edgy tragi-farce from Mike Binder ""we"" are suburban wife Terry Wolfmeyer (Joan Allen) whose husband has suddenly left her for his Swedish secretary. So Terry isnt so very happy at all. Keri Russell left Joan Allen Evan Rachel Wood and Erika Christensen in ""The Upside of Anger"" about a mother (Allen) who turns to alcohol after her husband leaves her.

The drinking starts early. And so does her razor humor with nasty one-liner quips at the dinner table in front of her shocked daughters. Or just sitting in front of the television which she does all day still in her nightgown. Terrys losing emotional contact with her children all of them bright and beautiful. She cant be there for them. Not right now. But shes still furious at them for growing away from her. Its a terrible affront to her self-pity. Her oldest daughter Hadley (Alicia Witt) a college student makes one of those hear-a-pin-drop announcements the kind that includes an upcoming wedding and a due date. And then theres Andy (Erika Christensen) who becomes involved with Shep (Binder) a sleazy middle-age radio producer who promises her a job but is really looking for a sexual relationship. Andy sees no problem with this arrangement. Emily (Keri Russell) is an aspiring ballet dancer whose obsession for her art has left her cold and lifeless. And theres Terrys youngest the teenaged Popeye (Evan Rachel Wood) whos all too observant about moms shortcomings and boozy funk. Cant a mother drink herself stupid without getting so much grief? The biggest event of Terrys life however isnt the disappearance of her husband or her deteriorating relationships with her daughters. Its Denny (Kevin Costner) Terrys roguish beer-swilling neighbor and a former baseball player who starts coming around every day as soon as he hears shes alone. Denny who has parlayed his fame into an on-air gig at Sheps radio station seems to have nothing better to do than bother Terry. What does he really want -- as if she doesnt know? Whats best about ""Upside"" is its gonzo-sitcom craziness a situation that lends itself to enjoyable performances. All four actresses are terrific as Terrys daughters. And so is Costner as the indolent ultimately sensitive Denny. The 50-year-old actor hasnt lost that lazy knowing charm that has served him so well in such films as ""Tin Cup."" Binders turn as Shep practically steals the movie. Hes about as scurrilous a character as ever slouched and sleazed his way across the screen. But hes so blissfully unapologetic you cant help but warm to the rascal. Allen is outstanding as the inebriated Terry whose senses are intoxicated but never dulled. Theres a wonderful scene in which she is invited to celebrate her daughter Hadleys nuptials with the future in-laws. But shes pretty upset about being the last to hear the news. Her every gesture from the way she rigorously orders her drinks to an addled longwinded toast of sheer aggression strikes a tense yet strangely humorous chord. While the actors are cooking away however the movie takes a conventional turn for the redemptive. Suddenly everyone seems directed toward saving themselves just in time for the ending. And though this development may be satisfying to many theres something underhanded and contrived as well. Apparently if you want to stop drinking for instance all you have to do is quit putting those bottles in your shopping cart. Its too bad Bill Wilson the co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous didnt hear about this sooner. Who needs to go through 12 steps of recovery when all you need is a transition montage? If only life were like that. THE UPSIDE OF ANGER (R 116 minutes) -- Contains obscenity sexual scenes drinking and drug use and some violence. Area theaters.

"Dumbness Is the Downside in The Upside of Anger washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Dumbness Is the Downside in The Upside of Anger Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday March 18 2005 To watch ""The Upside of Anger"" is to ask that timeless cinematic question Where have you gone James L. Brooks? Of course Brookss most recent film ""Spanglish"" raised the same query but think back to ""As Good as It Gets"" and you realize that Brooks remains the master of tart adult dramedy. ""The Upside of Anger"" written and directed by Mike Binder clearly aspires to be a Brooksian comedy of manners but instead it feels like a retread of several better movies with a nastier more bitter edge. No one in ""The Upside of Anger"" is nastier or more bitter than Terry Wolfmeyer a recently jilted mother of four daughters living in a plush mansion outside Detroit. Joan Allen whose recent role in ""Off the Map"" suggests that she is finally breaking out of roles calling for icy restraint here veers even further afield as a furious often unhinged woman on the verge of a murderous rampage. As the movie opens Terry is drunkenly explaining her husbands departure with his Swedish secretary to her four daughters (Erika Christensen Evan Rachael Wood Keri Russell and Alicia Witt). Throughout the film Terry unsteadily comes to terms with her newly single status and the fact that her daughters are growing up and out of her control. Meanwhile shes being heavily courted by Denny (Kevin Costner) a former pro baseball player who like Terry is a barely functioning alcoholic. Like last years inexplicably popular ""Sideways"" ""The Upside of Anger"" plays drinking problems for laughs an indication of the cheap shots it resorts to in order to move ahead. Binder also thinks its charming to have his two romantic leads conduct an otherwise soporific heart-to-heart in the middle of a traffic jam they caused and to end nearly every scene with someone -- usually Costner -- dissolving into a fit of goofy giggles. Costner as the character who would be played by Jack Nicholson in Brookss version of the movie is no Nicholson. But his lumbering blandness qualifies him to play a man who when life hands him lemons chooses to make a big Tom Collins. Still for someone of such laid-back tendencies Denny is an oddly charmless dullard who serves more as a foil for the raging female emotions swirling around him than as an authentic character. ""You know somethin?"" Costner says in a typical piece of dialogue. ""Nothin."" Indeed. As Terry Allen delivers a volatile performance that only occasionally descends from finely controlled rage to something more akin to acting-school hysterics (a scene in which she catches one of her daughters having sex finds Allen in the rare position of overacting). Viewers will recognize Terry as one of a new breed of movie mothers women who came of age in the 60s and who unapologetically enjoyed the recreational substances of that era and has often unnervingly frank relationships with their kids. These are the older slightly more cynical sisters of the WBs Lorelai Gilmore who are as likely to cadge a joint off their teenagers as they are to nag them to do homework. Like Sigourney Weavers character in the recent ""Imaginary Heroes"" as well as the moms in ""Pieces of April"" ""Donnie Darko"" and ""Thirteen"" Allens Terry and her prickly exasperation will surely strike a familiar chord in anyone who has found herself trapped in a life she doesnt quite remember asking for. But unlike the often witheringly funny ""Pieces of April"" or ""Lovely amp; Amazing"" Nicole Holofceners fine-toothed excavation of a mothers love for her daughters ""The Upside of Anger"" demonstrates little by way of insight or truly observant humor. As he did in his similarly cliched HBO series ""The Mind of the Married Man"" Binder seems more interested in indulging his own fantasies about how women operate rather than delving deeply into the more complex contradictory dynamics of their relationships. Its telling that in one scene -- in which viewers will be steeling themselves for a ""Terms of Endearment""-like revelation -- Binder explicitly invokes Larry David his far more talented colleague at HBO. Binder obviously fancies himself a purveyor of Davids signature brand of comedy-with-a-cruel-streak; the problem is that Binders humor has a dumb streak twice as wide. Whats more as its preposterously silly ending suggests he has failed to heed Davids Golden Rule No hugging no learning. One might add no stealing unless you can make it better. The Upside of Anger (116 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for profanity sexual situations brief comic violence and some drug use.

(AP Photo/New Line Productions/ Paul Chedlow) Photo PAUL CHEDLOW Nobility overrides an alcoholic haze 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Upside of Anger Drama. Starring Joan Allen Kevin Costner Erika Christensen Evan Rachel Wood Keri Russell Alicia Witt and Mike Binder. Written and directed by Binder. (R. 118 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In a rare adult moment Hollywood gave the go-ahead to ""The Upside of Anger"" -- the kind of drama thats become a dinosaur on screens overrun by computer-generated creatures. The characters are actually believable and the messes they get into approximate real life. So the temptation is to forgive a plot hole big enough to drive an 18- wheeler through especially while transfixed by Joan Allen and Kevin Costner as an unlikely couple brought together by fate and geographic proximity. These wondrous performances would evoke the O word if it werent so soon after the last Oscar ceremony. Allen stars as Terry a suburban Detroit housewife whose husband abruptly runs off to Sweden with his secretary leaving her a large house and four headstrong daughters to care for. Anger contorts this abandoned wifes face deepening the lines between her nose and mouth. When Terry screams at her children out of frustration the veins on her neck pop out. Often shot with no makeup Allen gives the most naked performance possible with your clothes on. Related Stories Good acting adult plot make Upside of Anger worth seeing Costner is her neighbor a retired baseball player named Denny in homage to Detroit Tigers great Denny McLain. Hollywoods onetime golden boy has been in a slump lately but playing sluggers is something he knows how to do and in ""Anger"" he hits one out of the park. Costner is built like an athlete agile and loose. His Denny is still loose even though hes gone soft with the beginnings of a paunch. This is a man whose best years are behind him. As he tells Terry while trying to convince her to sell her land so a subdivision can be built on it ""Im just a front man flashing my World Series ring. They get the sales -- I get a free lot out of it."" Costner makes Dennys resignation palpable in the embarrassed way he autographs baseballs for money -- his shoulders are hunched and his head hung low. Mike Binder wrote and directed ""The Upside of Anger"" and he brings to it the same sensibility of his underappreciated HBO series ""The Mind of the Married Man."" Binder knows that people behave foolishly but are also capable of noble acts. Terry and Dennys bumpy relationship is a prime example. It develops from a mutual appreciation for the numbing effects of alcohol. Denny sneaks into her bathroom while shes showering. Covered only in a towel she orders him out; Denny agrees to leave but says the drink hes poured for her goes with him. She grabs the martini glass like the drunk shes turned into. Their sex scenes cant compare with Costner and Susan Sarandons wild lovemaking in ""Bull Durham."" He was an aging baseball player in that one but not quite over the hill. Still its fun to see Allen and Costner crack up after their odd couples first time in the sack. Exercising a screenwriters prerogative Binder has penned a juicy role for himself as Shep the producer of Dennys radio talk show which was supposed to be about baseball except that the host finds the subject a bore and would rather offer stock tips. Shep is one of those slimy men who use their vaulted position to attract women half their age. When he takes up with Terrys 18-year-old Mom lets him know exactly what she thinks of his behavior by punching him out. The daughters are played by Erika Christensen Evan Rachel Wood Keri Russell and Alicia Witt. Theyre talented actresses able to portray the girls as wise beyond their years. One slight quibble -- they look nothing at all like one another or Allen. Usually casting directors strive to construct a family where theres at least a slight resemblance. The bigger problem is that plot hole. It doesnt give anything away to say it has to do with a death since ""Anger"" begins with a funeral. At the end when you discover who is laid out in the coffin you leave the theater scratching your head more in utter confusion than in anger. -- Advisory This film contains sex scenes and adult language.

Browse over 8 million products  Clothing amp; Jewelry  Computers amp; Electronics  Home amp; Garden  Kids amp; Family Upside of Anger wisely centers on Joan AllenBy Claudia Puig USA TODAY The primary upside to The Upside of Anger is the presence of Joan Allen in the lead role. Joan Allen second from left plays a woman who must cope after her husband unexpectedly disappears. New Line Productions Allen is one of the most reliable American actresses and her intelligence and wit raise the quality of a movie that often feels as if it belongs on the Lifetime cable net- work. She transcends the soap-opera nature of the story and lends the film emotional heft. Allen plays the prickly and sharp-tongued Terry a suburban mother of four daughters whose husband suddenly leaves her. She grows embittered seemingly overnight relying on booze and sarcasm for solace. Her daughters experience their own psychological and physical traumas to add to her mounting unease. Kevin Costner does a fine job as Terrys laid-back drinking buddy/neighbor who is surprisingly comfortable hanging out in a household of five women. Terrys daughters -- played by some of the best young actresses around including Erika Christensen and Evan Rachel Wood -- work well despite limited material. About the movie The Upside of Anger   1/2 (out of four) Stars Joan Allen Kevin Costner Erika Christensen Evan Rachel Wood Keri Russell Alicia Witt Mike Binder Director Mike Binder Distributor New Line Cinema Rated R for language sexual situations brief comic violence and some drug use Opens Friday in New York and Los Angeles A major drawback is director/screenwriter Mike Binders unfortunate decision to cast himself in a key role as a radio station manager who seduces Christensen. She comes looking for a job at the station where Costner a former baseball star has a talk show. She gets an entry-level spot and a slimy skirt-chaser in her bed to boot. Not really an actor and not much of a comedian Binder could have spent his time more wisely focusing his energies on polishing the script. Many of the comic moments in the film are in the broad and silly vein of a second-rate sitcom with gags centering largely on drunkenness that wear thin pretty fast. The Upside of Anger does have its entertaining moments usually centered on Allen whose edgy comic ability is well established with this role. She also adds nuance and shading to her anger and sense of betrayal sometimes coming off bull-headed self-absorbed or sheepish but always authentic. Its baffling that Binder could write such a complex character and so wisely cast Allen in the part then allow his own role to be such a cliche. Nonetheless after his last project HBOs boorish and bawdy The Mind of the Married Man his decision to explore the many colors of rage from both comic and dramatic angles is an intriguing choice.

"Upside of Anger The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; upside-of-anger-the ) Upside of Anger The (United States/Germany/United Kingdom 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli Now that Kevin Costner has grown too old to convincingly play a baseball star (even an aging Major Leaguer as in For Love of the Game) he has progressed logically. In The Upside of Anger he portrays an ex-Detroit Tiger whose life has deteriorated the further age has taken him from the diamond. Its an effective performance but only a supporting one. The Upside of Anger belongs to Joan Allen (for whom director/screenwriter Mike Binder developed the project) and theres no way Costner or any of Allens younger co-stars is going to steal even the most minor scene from her. When the film opens Terry Wolfmeyer (Allen) has been devastated. Her husband Gray has vanished without a trace presumably running off to Europe with his secretary. Terry is left to care for four teenage daughters all of whom are exhibiting different degrees of rebelliousness. Hadley (Alicia Witt) the college student treats her mother with disdain and cant wait for her school break to be over so she can escape from her family. Andy (Erika Christensen) has decided that college isnt for her; she gets a job as a production assistant at a local radio station and embarks upon an affair with her sleazy boss Shep (Mike Binder). Emily (Keri Russell) wants to be a professional dancer and refuses to go to a traditional university. And Popeye (Evan Rachel Wood) is experimenting with drugs and wants nothing more than to have a boyfriend. Into this tumultuous five-woman household comes Denny Davies (Costner) an ex-baseball player turned radio talk show host with a ""thing"" for Terry. Despite his alcoholism he turns out to be a stabilizing influence on the Wolfmeyer household - to a point. This sort of ""domestic drama"" fits squarely into the ""chick flick"" niche and its evident that the film will be a bigger draw for women than men. The Upside of Anger offers a lot of smart dialogue and six nicely developed characters. The overall storyline is slight and relies on at least one significant contrivance but the movie offers enough in the way of small pleasures to be worth a recommendation provided you enjoy this kind of low-key drama. Theres nothing here (except perhaps the scene where Denny kicks in a door) thats going to appeal to those who are in search of a testosterone cocktail. Aside from Allen and Costner the cast is comprised of four of todays up-and-coming young actresses. All acquit themselves admirably taking characters who are not written with much depth and developing them into believable individuals. Of the four Alicia Witt has been around the longest having appeared in numerous indie movies during the last 10 years. (She was also a regular in the mid-1990s TV show ""Cybill"".) Keri Russell who starred for five years as ""Felicity"" is beginning to make inroads into movies. Erika Christensen appeared in Traffic before making a splash with Swimfan. And Evan Rachel Wood is best known for Thirteen. As I mentioned earlier this is Allens film. It represents something of an unusual role for her in that she is able to display raw emotion and a sexual side. (Allen is often cast in low-key roles.) Terry is a hard-drinking somewhat unstable individual and Allen never stumbles in her portrayal. Its also worth noting that despite being surrounded by four younger attractive females the 48-year old Allen consistently comes across as the hottest of the bunch. Unlike some movies in this genre The Upside of Anger does not engage in male-bashing. Despite his flaws Denny is essentially a good guy. He does his best to hide his streak of nobility underneath a cloak of drunkenness and laziness but there are times when the armor shines through. The film features a louse - Dennys producer Shep (who is also Andys boss and bed-partner) - but he is not patterned as a one-dimensional villain. The film gives us a couple of scenes that offer insight into why he is the way he is. Individual scenes shine and every member of the cast has at least one golden moment. There are a lot of instances that ring true on an emotional level and although some of the material wades into dark and murky waters Binders screenplay never loses its sense of humor. For those who are bothered by movies in which main characters are lushes its worth noting that both Denny and Terry drink less the farther the film progresses. The Upside of Anger is a pleasant diversion sandwiched between the ugly releases of winter and the higher profile blockbusters of mid-spring.
