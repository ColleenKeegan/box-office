Entertainment How ""Furious 7"" Stacks Up To The Other ""Fast And Furious"" Movies One last ride? We hope they never stop. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic 7. 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003) View this image > Eli Reed / Universal Studios ID 5402039 Directed by John SingletonWritten by Michael Brandt Derek HaasThe Fast and the Furious wasnt always the globe-trotting gravity challenged literally (and poignantly) death-defying monster franchise it is today. In fact it could have totally ground to a halt in 2003 with 2 Fast 2 Furious a half-hearted sequel directed by John Singleton that moved the street racing action from Los Angeles to Miami but otherwise ran on fumes from the first movie. (And it almost did -- according to screenwriter Chris Morgan who boarded the series in its third installment the studio was ready to go straight to DVD after this second film.) View this image > Eli Reed / Universal Studios ID 5402046 Vin Diesel the 2001 movies brawny breakout was nowhere to be seen off trying to be a solo action star with the first films director Rob Cohen in xXx and leaving Paul Walker game and golden but never capable of his former and future co-stars gravitas to carry on without him. In Diesels place Tyrese Gibson played Brian OConners (Walker) new partner in crime Roman Pearce a childhood friend whose resentment over Brians adventures in law enforcement quickly burned away in favor of bantering bromance.The real fondness Gibson and Walker seemed to have for one another is the best part of 2 Fast 2 Furious even if they often feel like two sidekicks in search of a main character. Walker who died in 2013 in an unrelated car accident during a break from filming Furious 7 always looked more comfortable with someone to play off of and pal around with than he did going solo. But 2 Fast 2 Furious channels the rapport between the fast-talking Roman and the... blond Brian through the series most wretched dialogue. Every other line Brian utters is punctuated with ""bro"" (""Im not a cop anymore bro"") and Roman actually refers to a place as a ""hoasis."" On the plus side Roman does rightly describe what happens in the climactic scene as ""some real Dukes of Hazzard shit."" Then everyone basically high-fives and lives happily ever after bro.Still consider this exchangeROMAN What you checking her out for?BRIAN Im not checking her out.ROMAN Yes you were.BRIAN No I wasnt.ROMAN I seen you checking her out man.BRIAN OK I was. Now shut up.ROMAN You shut up. Dont tell me to shut up. View this image > The ""stare and drive"" Universal Pictures ID 5402111 The ""her"" being checked out is Monica Fuentes (Eva Mendes) an undercover Customs agent who is trying to take down a drug lord named Carter Verone (Cole Hauser) and who has possibly gotten in too deep and flipped. Its an underdeveloped parallel to what happened to Brian with whom she gets semi-entangled in the first Fast and Furious film.While Ludacris character Tej whos also introduced in this underwhelming installment becomes a series regular Monica has only shown up once more -- in the stinger for Fast Five. Its noteworthy for a franchise in love with bringing characters back and seems to be more about what Monica represents than it is anything to do with Mendes. For all the consistently gyrating women the series uses as set dressing the Fast and Furious movies do not blithely shuffle in new love interests (or replacement besties) every installment. They have continuity. Theyre about family. They are complications of amnesia aside unexpectedly monogamous. 6. Fast amp; Furious (2009) View this image > Universal Studios ID 5402057 Directed by Justin LinWritten by Chris MorganBy 2009 Diesel had crept back to the Fast and Furious series to produce as well as to play whats become the defining role of his career Dominic Toretto the franchises smooth-pated patriarch who with his childhood sweetheart Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and a new gang kicks off this installment on the run in the Dominican Republic hijacking fuel tankers. In addition to Leo Tego (Tego Calderon) and Rico Santos (Don Omar) Doms crew includes Han Seoul-Oh (Sung Kang) from The Fast and the Furious Tokyo Drift in the start of what becomes an impressive fidelity to a convoluted universe (the Fastverse?). View this image > Universal Studios ID 5402195 Han dies in Tokyo Drift but hes alive in Fast amp; Furious which came out after that movie but which takes place before it filling out the claim made in Diesels closing Tokyo Drift cameo that Dom and Han were friends who rode together. Sadly after a nifty opening sequence that involves flaming wreckage bouncing down a highway Han takes off and then so does Dom sneaking out on Letty in the middle of the night in hopes of protecting her. Instead he gets her killed (well ""killed"") when she returns to Los Angeles with a plan to clear his name.Fast amp; Furious reunites Dom Brian Letty and Mia (Jordana Brewster) from the first film but recycles an awful lot of the dramas too. Brians a cop or rather an FBI agent again despite how improbable that development is. He has to win back Doms trust again. He has to charm his way into Mias heart again. ""Maybe youre not the good guy pretending to be a bad guy. Maybe youre the bad guy pretending to be the good guy"" Mia tells him which he broods over as if he hasnt gone through the same dilemma once before. View this image > Universal Studios ID 5402158 Fast amp; Furious is a revenge story with Dom and Brian both trying to take down Braga (John Ortiz) the cartel boss responsible for Lettys ""death."" But in the overall span of the franchise it feels more like bombastic filler an installment to bridge the gap between a series thats about car racing and a series thats about insane international automotive-enabled heists. And this films big action idea to send cars racing through narrow underground tunnels across the U.S.-Mexico border is better in theory than in practice where it looks deflatingly video-game-like. The best thing Fast amp; Furious does is end with Brian cutting his ties with being a bad good guy forever instead embracing good bad-guydom by going to bust Dom out as hes on his way to prison. 5. The Fast and the Furious (2001) View this image > Universal Studios ID 5402222 Directed by Rob CohenWritten by Gary Scott Thompson Erik Bergquist David AyerThe original The Fast and Furious is Point Break on wheels right? Paul Walker is Johnny Utah and Vin Diesel is Bodhi and instead of an extreme surfer lifestyle being financed by bank robberies in presidential masks theres an extreme street racing lifestyle being financed by truck hijackings in modified Honda Civics. The beats are all pretty much the same except in this version Bodhi doesnt die out in the epic waves -- he goes on to anchor a franchise. View this image > Universal Studios ID 5403166 Rob Cohen isnt nearly as deft a director of action as Kathryn Bigelow and street racing down a quarter mile straight isnt nearly as cinematic as surfing -- theres a reason the series has upped its stakes with crazier and crazier car stunts in each installment. But The Fast and the Furious does understand that like Point Break it is fundamentally a deep platonic romance between two men with a shared defining passion. Brians a cop and Doms a criminal but theyre both racers inside. When Brian falls in love with Doms sister Mia (Jordana Brewster is totally the Lori Petty of this universe) its like hes doing the next best thing to actually getting together with Dom.The actions not as flashy as what would come and the scales much smaller but The Fast and the Furious lays out details that become totemic for the franchise the Echo Park house in which Dom and Mia live and in which they grew up the black 1970 Dodge Charger in the garage that belonged to their late father and the tradition of grace being said over dinner at a cookout by whoever reached for the food first. Many of the elements and dynamics that have remained central to the series as its gotten more and more outsized are here at the start. View this image > Universal Studios ID 5403553 What is jarring looking back at this first film is its whiteness. The Fast and Furious series has become a testament to the way a diverse ensemble can be both a pleasure to watch and good business. But in the film that started it all the majority of the main characters are white even as the world they live in is distinctly not. Multiracial ethnically ambiguous Diesel may be paired in different ways with Michelle Rodriguez and Brewster but in addition to Walker his team is made up of Chad Lindberg Johnny Strong and Matt Schulze. They just race against different drivers of color including antagonist Johnny Tran (Rick Yune).Yes its something that does change. But what doesnt is the way that for a franchise that doses itself as heavily with testosterone as an unwashed teenager layering on Axe body spray the Fast and Furious series retains a gigantic mushy heart. And its all courtesy of Vin Diesel who sells the hell out of the idiot poetry of this first film. ""I live my life a quarter mile at a time"" he rumbles in that basso profundo. ""Nothing else matters not the mortgage not the store not my team and all their bullshit. For those 10 seconds or less Im free."" Its the kind of speech that should be silly and is instead somehow soulful. 4. Furious 6 (2013) View this image > Universal Studios ID 5402240 Directed by Justin LinWritten by Chris MorganWith the exception of 2 Fast 2 Furious this franchise has always been built around sincere endorsements of family (and sometimes familia) in the literal sense as well as family ""of choice."" The last three installments have cemented that family as a multiethnic coalition of super-loyal super-attractive precision drivers wholl come running from other continents if needed. And in the case of Furious 6 theyre needed in London. This movie may not be as good as the ones that come directly before and after it but it affirms the connections its ensemble of characters has while introducing the next generation of heavy-footed racers -- the baby Mia gives birth to at the start of the film and who Brian and Dom immediately start tempting with toy versions of their preferred Japanese and American car models. View this image > Giles Keyte / Universal Studios ID 5403576 The villain in Furious 6 is a not terribly memorable Luke Evans as Owen Shaw who was part of some mobile warfare something or other and whos got an elaborate plan to steal a computer chip or whatever... Hes got this cool-looking skeleton car OK? Hes a transparent excuse to bring the team back together but the real reason is Letty who in a delightfully soap opera twist turns out to not be dead but instead has amnesia and has been recruited into Lukes crew. Luke runs the anti-family to Doms family -- he thinks ""a team is nothing but pieces moved around until the job is done"" and his code is the chilly ""precision."" His crew hilariously looks like the ""evil twins"" of Doms crew as Roman points out with Brians match being fellow high-cheekboned blonde Vegh (Clara Paget).Clearly Furious 6 isnt the greatest plotwise -- in a series thats proudly ridiculous thats never been a strong point. The battle against Luke Shaws non-family is really just a way to get us to some great action sequences. Theres the one in which the wanted Brian slips with laughable ease back into the U.S. and into prison to interrogate Fast amp; Furious baddie Braga the one in which Gina Carano and Michelle Rodriguez have a bruising brawl in the London subway while Tyrese Gibson and Sung Kang get their asses comically handed to them by The Raid Redemptions Joe Taslim and theres the one in which the team faces down an actual tank. But the best scene is the unconventionally romantic interlude in which Dom shows up at a street race (overseen by Rita Ora) to woo the amnesiac Letty by competing against her. View this image > Universal Studios ID 5403658 They coast through the city with cops in pursuit flirting by way of evasive maneuvers eventually pulling over to compare scars with Letty more and more uncertain but also unconvinced. Its love Fast and Furious-style powerful enough to enable Dom to catch Letty midair like Superman in a later scene. The steroided-out sweetness of the whole thing counterbalances the parallel tragedy involving Han and his girlfriend Gisele (future Wonder Woman Gal Gadot). The romance between Dom and Letty is so canonical that Elsa Pataky -- whose Brazilian cop character Elena became a replacement love interest for Dom when he thought Letty was dead -- arrives to gracefully bow out and to give the pair her blessing. Its about as dignified a breakup as a gal whos just been replaced by her boyfriends formerly dead memory-wiped ex could hope for. 3. Furious 7 (2015) View this image > Universal Studios ID 5402254 Directed by James WanWritten by Chris MorganOnly an action franchise in which characters regularly declare their affection for one another could pull off the ending of Furious 7 which serves as a full-on elegy and tribute to Paul Walker and Brian OConner turning the movie into the years stealthiest tearjerker. Its unabashedly sentimental its poignant and its eerie. View this image > Universal Studios ID 5403869 Walker had filmed some of his scenes before his death and the rest were accommodated with rewrites careful editing and some CGI tweaking of the faces of stand-ins including Walkers brothers Caleb and Cody. While not seamless it works and an awareness of Walkers death is an undercurrent running throughout Furious 7 right down to the tagline ""One last ride."" Those final scenes though give an almost explicit nod to his passing with an image thats all the more sad for its imperfection Walker is transformed into a digital ghost.The rest of the movie is joyfully excessive with The Conjurings James Wan ably taking the reins from previous director Justin Lin. Wan has a finely calibrated sense of the balance his film needs between the serious the spectacularly over-the-top and the genuine. Its a good thing because Furious 7 manages to have the least sensical plot out of the entire franchise. Jason Statham plays Deckard Shaw older brother to Owen from the last film who sets out to avenge his sibling. View this image > Universal Studios ID 5402355 But never mind all that. Furious 7 strings together three jaw-dropping set pieces with skydiving cars in the Caucasus Mountains a skyscraper jump in Abu Dhabi and a multi-vehicle scrum in the streets of Los Angeles that involves a drone and a rooftop fight like something out of Highlander. Furious 7 commits like nothing else -- its filled with callbacks to the earlier films it has a dramatic twist that would do any telenovela proud and it treats Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson like the magnificent living action figure he is with a scene in which he gets his broken arm to heal with the force of his will alone.The fact that Furious 7 is messier than any of the past installments is more than mitigated by its grandeur. ""Dom cars dont fly Cars dont fly"" Brian yells before its biggest stunt. Furious 7 makes you believe they can. 2. Fast Five (2011) View this image > Universal Studios ID 5402281 Directed by Justin LinWritten by Chris MorganFast Five is the movie that brought this franchise out of the realms of the maybe very remotely believable and into the gleefully outrageous picking up right where Fast amp; Furious left off with Brian and Mia chasing after the transport bringing Dom to prison. After Brian manages to do the equivalent of sticking his foot out to trip someone only with his car and a bus Doms freed and the fugitives are off to Rio de Janeiro where they immediately get involved in the local crime scene. View this image > Jaimie Trueblood / Universal Studios ID 5403733 Fast Five treats Rio like a gorgeous backdrop a fabulous playground and one big china shop waiting to be destroyed even before they go trundling through the city dragging a giant safe through the streets and the occasional bank lobby. Nestled up in the favelas the team quickly attracts the attention of yet another ruthless crime lord Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) as well as Diplomatic Security Service Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and his Under Armour-clad team who arrive intending to bring the three back.Of course he doesnt. Fast Five is so immensely satisfying because Hobbs becomes part of the family just like Gisele like Han like Roman like Tej like Vince (Matt Schulze) the suspicious dude from the first movie that everyone forgot about. The Fastverse is triumphant by Fast Five a consistent place in which characters can disappear for multiple movies and then turn up in Brazil still harboring resentments from several installments ago. If the Fast and Furious films reflect shifts in how race is presented on the big screen they also contain a mini-history of the changing nature of star power and the rise of the franchise. In the franchise stars do not have to be doled out a few per installment. They accrue or they come back and they stick around and their characters really like each other. View this image > Universal Studios ID 5403743 Johnson fits seamlessly into the world of the series as the only man around to be even more of a human phallic symbol than Diesel -- hes just as bald but even more bulgy possessed of even tighter shirts and with even less of a neck. Diesels greatest gift is his ability to deliver lines like ""Were going to do this... were going to do one last job"" and have them come across as unaccountably fervent. The Rocks greatest gift is his ability to deliver lines like ""You know I like my dessert first"" (when asked if he wants someone to lead with the good news or the bad news) and to have it sound hilarious without ever being winking. When Dom and Hobbs finally have it out after much buildup its like the long-awaited sex scene of brutal fights with the pair grappling and smashing each other through walls.Fast Five confirms that what has powered this preposterous series forward is not NOS but earnestness. It goes on to get bigger dumber and more incredible but it doesnt smirk at itself or the audience. Its unapologetic about what it is which is a celebration of some of the movies most basic pleasures -- beautiful people driving beautiful cars. 1. The Fast and the Furious Tokyo Drift (2006) View this image > Universal Studios ID 5402301 Directed by Justin LinWritten by Chris MorganRob Cohen may have started the Fast and Furious movies but Justin Lin and Chris Morgan built them into a universe -- a universe that truly started with this third installment in which they dumped out the pieces of the existing two movies and figured out which ones to keep. Its ironic that it took what was essentially a reboot to save a series that would fall so in love with continuity but aside from the street racing theme The Fast and the Furious Tokyo Drift only retains two points of contact with the earlier films. It ends with a cameo from Vin Diesel as Dom and it stars Lucas Black whos very much the poor mans Paul Walker as the very-not-teenage-looking teenager Sean Boswell whos sent to Japan to live with his father after getting in trouble for racing back in Arizona. View this image > Universal Studios ID 5403812 The utterly cornpone Sean is plunked into Tokyo in what looks like your standard white-guy-as-window-into-foreign-world setup except that Seans adrift in his own story too. Hes just a stupid kid who likes cars and girls like Neela (Nathalie Kelley) his classmate whos caught up in a complicated relationship with local bad boy Takashi (Brian Tee) better known as DK the Drift King. The stealth lead of the movie is Han whos allied with DK but with whom hes also playing power games. And Han takes Sean under his wing because of how much the newcomer gets under the baby yakuzas skin.If Dom is the character that anchors the series Han is its most subversive addition and a built-in rebuke to the Hollywood assumption that a movie can go anywhere only so long as it has a good-looking white person in the main role. Kang steals the movie from Black and Han becomes the character who goes forward into future installments (all taking place in the past). Hes a much-needed reclaiming of laconic screen cool in the form of an Asian-American male. Lin and Morgan make sure he gets the girl too in subsequent films falling for Gisele not (just) because shes played by the former Miss Israel but because shes such a skilled driver. And his name is goddamn Han Seoul-Oh. When the franchise arrived at its current ensemble state it was thanks to this film which freed it from being just a star vehicle and opened it up to new sorts of badassery. View this image > Universal Studios ID 5403409 The driving sequences in The Fast and the Furious Tokyo Drift are also the series most beautiful taking advantage of tight spaces whereas before the horizons were wide open. The first race in a city parking lot is fantastically unlike the muscling down roads with the help of NOS boosts and high-performance engines that weve seen before. The series has traveled farther afield since this movie to the gaps between glass towers in the United Arab Emirates but its most sublime moment is still the one in which Sean and Neela in the middle of a chase go coasting through Shibuya crossing. The neon-lit intersection is one of the busiest in the world but as people scramble out of the way of the charging car for a moment everything is still. Its not the speed thats the most thrilling part of this series after all despite the name. Its the quiet in the midst of all of it thats where the lunatic lyricism can be found.

He plays Brian a vehicular warrior who is married to Mia (Jordana Brewster) the sister of his partner-in-arms Dom (Vin Diesel). The partners are mobilized again--together with the martial artist Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) who is Doms wife; the class clown Roman (Tyrese Gibson); and the tech wiz Tej (Ludacris)--to combat a double-barrelled assault. The evil Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) is trying to kill them and his partner-in-terror Jakande (Djimon Hounsou) has kidnapped the hacker Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) whose ""Gods eye"" gizmo can track them across the globe. The federal government--represented by the helmet-coiffed Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell)--kicks in some equipment and the chase begins taking the heroes from Los Angeles to the Caucasus Mountains and Abu Dhabi and back. Along the way they achieve the impossible with vertiginous style blending NASCAR maneuvers with demolition-derby impact special-forces exploits with acrobatic aplomb. The director James Wan sends cars repeatedly airborne and seems himself to marvel at the results; the movies real subject is the stunt work but its stars authentic chemistry lends melody to its relentless beat. The wreckage of cities is just a backdrop for the thrill of hard-won victory and the familial bonding that results.

Fourteen years and six films later theres precious little alone time for the Furious clan. This lucrative franchise has so many recurring characters that they really should trade in their muscle cars and charter a team bus. Overpopulation worthy of an X-Men flick is just one pothole for Furious 7 which at 137 minutes also suffers from bloating and repetition. Yet the first movie in the series to be directed by Saws James Wan is as zippy playful and amiably preposterous as the best of the previous models. The filmmakers even finesse the most conspicuous problem Walkers November 2013 car-crash death which occurred midway through the shoot. The actors already-filmed scenes were supplemented with CGI doubles and unused footage from previous movies. But Wan and veteran Furious scripter Chris Morgan could have elected to write him out of much of the story as they did with Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson). Theres just not room for everyone in a movie that introduces three fresh villains played by Jason Statham Djimon Hounsou and Tony Jaa as well as two new allies portrayed by Nathalie Emmanuel and onetime action star Kurt Russell (who now looks more like Richard Nixon than Snake Plissken). Plus an Iggy Azalea cameo. Whos revving his engine for Fast 8? Jean-Claude Van Damme? Statham enters first as Deckard the brother of a guy the Famp;F gang bested in the previous episode. Deckard wants revenge and has the ex-special-forces skills to get it. His black-ops background underscores that the Furious saga which began with L.A. drag racers has detoured onto MIs course. This movies plot involves a new computer surveillance device coveted by both the U.S. government and a Bond-style super-baddie. And the action zooms from London to Tokyo Azerbaijan Abu Dhabi and the Dominican Republic. Back in L.A. Brian is driving a mini-van and making babies with Mia (Jordana Brewster) Doms sister. Meanwhile amnesiac Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) cant quite remember that shes Doms longtime squeeze. She can still race like a demon though as she proves in one of several scenes thats part bikini beach party -- complete with awestruck close-ups of thong-clad bottoms. After Deckards threat becomes evident Dom and Brian mobilize Letty and regulars Tej (Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges) and Roman (Tyrese Gibson). An anonymous government agent (Russell) promises to help but only if the car club first rescues a computer prodigy (Emmanuel) who turns out also to be partial to swimsuits. The plan involves driving through midair a feat the filmmakers like so much they stage it several more times under different pretexts. These nutty set pieces assert that Famp;F movies are about cars even if they really arent anymore. The stunts are also heavier-than-air homages to Hong Kong action movies which are full of delirious gravity-denying moves -- and have been a crucial influence on the series. The gangs Asian member doesnt have much of a role this time but that doesnt prevent Furious 7 from continuing the series utopian vision of a post-racial world. Dom the crews closest thing to a philosopher king even refers to his white black and cafe-au-lait pals as ""mi familia."" That sentimental message is essential to the movies appeal even if it cant always be heard over the thumping hip-hop thundering hard rock and shattering collisions.

"Drivin and Cryin Old Ridiculousness and New Emotion Converge in Furious 7 << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Drivin and Cryin Old Ridiculousness and New Emotion Converge in Furious 7 universal pictures Movies April 3 2015 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print ... And in the seventh part they refused to die. Still. Its true that two early scenes in Furious 7 occur at cemeteries. But by the second trip Roman (Tyrese Gibson) makes everyone in his government-sponsored car club promise that this is it for graveyards and it is. Two characters go tumbling down a mountain in an armored car and a couple of scenes later are chatting on a beach. When one speeding car needs to deposit its hotly pursued passenger into another speeding car the transfer requires each vehicle to swerve into a parallel formation so that the body can slip from one window through the other. (It took longer to type that than it did to watch.) A physicist might say of the deposited ""See you at the morgue."" But physics are to the Fast amp; Furious movies what term limits are to dictators something to be flouted. That transfer is but one of the dozen or so incidents in this movie that drop your jaw steal your breath and make you want to say ""I do."" Characters of course have died in these films. They just dont stay dead. And theres a glorious soapiness to some of that. Furious 7 has Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) standing over her own grave struggling to remember all the driving and snarling shed previously done. She tells Dom (Vin Diesel) she needs time for self-rediscovery which would seem to entail relearning that this bald muscle-bound man with the Anthony Quinn mumbles is her husband. More Fast amp; Furious Drivin and Cryin Old Ridiculousness and New Emotion Converge in Furious 7 John Singleton Reveals How Ja Rule Blew His Chance to Be in 2 Fast 2 Furious Should You See It? A Curious Consumers Decision-Making Guide to Furious 7 The Fast-ies Handing Out Awards for the Greatest Films in the History of Western Civilization The Bad Guys Weirdness Index Who Is the Strangest Baddie in Movie History? This series has resurrected both itself -- Installment 3 (the silly slinky hilariously homoerotic and only modestly lucrative Tokyo Drift) had virtually nothing to do with Parts 1 and 2 -- and Diesels career. But of all the phoenixes to rise from Fast amp; Furious rubble none has been as uncanny as Paul Walker. In late 2013 he died in a car accident unrelated to the filming of this movie. His appearance as a fully integrated member of the narrative nonsense epitomizes movie magic. I at least cant tell the real Walker from the digital composite. And that seems miraculous. There was a time when that lack of distinction between him and something less organically animate would mark the occasion for a joke. He was not a great actor. But these movies didnt require that of him. They required the shine of an action star and in this world he shone. Walker of course was the original centerpiece of these movies. In the first installment he was the chill white LAPD officer from whose point of view we were meant to see Doms multicultural ring of road-racing Los Angeles car thieves. Hed infiltrated the ring and by the first films end he was in love with Doms sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) and helping the gang elude capture. By the second installment without Diesel he was in a plot that narratively handcuffed him to Gibson who plays an ex-con. They did white-guy-black-guy action comedy. The longer the series went on the more racially and ethnically panoramic it became. By 2011s Fast Five without any self-congratulation and without demoting Walker the point of view had expanded. Hed become an equal player in an action melodrama that was once primarily about him. Fourteen years later Walkers Brian OConner is pressuring himself to abandon high-velocity vengeance. In a movie full of good gags and throwaway lines the one of Walker revving the engine of what turns out to be a minivan traveling only 2 feet is the best. He and Mia are about to become parents again. The explosive arrival of Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) the brother of the previous movies not-entirely-vanquished Eurobaddie (Im telling you this series doesnt believe in death -- or at least checking toe tags) puts Dom amp; Co. on the defensive. Shaw kills a member of Doms crew narrowly misses taking out Dom Brian and Mia and their son and hospitalizes the government security agent and Friend of Fast amp; Furious Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) in a classically impossible fight at Hobbss workplace. (The audiences applause for the slamming of Statham through a glass coffee table was third only to the first close-up of Walker and the climactic shattering of an arm cast.) The OConners are shipped to the Dominican Republic to the compound of a guy played by the music star Romeo Santos. Dom wants Shaw as badly as Shaw wants him. But first covert-operations muckety-muck Frank Petty (Kurt Russell) convinces Dom to rescue a hacker named Ramsey whos invented a global tracking device that -- well it does what such surveillance devices do in movies but with faster upload speeds. Petty has taken the trouble to assemble Doms team -- Brian Roman Letty and the engineer and technologist Tej (Ludacris) -- and has given them free reign over the toys in his agencys hangar-size emporium of military-industrial fun. This mission requires via another crazy stunt dropping onto a road in of all places the Caucasus Mountains for the thwarting of the African nut job (Djimon Hounsou) who wants the hacker and the tracker. Furious 7 is the writer Chris Morgans fifth of these movies. Hats off to his gonzo plotting and geo-racial sense of humor. If Dom amp; Co. can rescue the hacker and retrieve the device Petty will allow them to use it to catch and crush Shaw. Really the frequency with which Shaw just arrives mid-action-sequence is very funny and extremely stupid. Apparently Shaws tracking device is set to ""Dom."" In any case the chasing and running lead to the sand and skyscrapers of Abu Dhabi then back to the streets of Los Angeles. In each city the wanton ovation-worthy demolition barely lets up. You can spend a lifetime watching movies and see very little that approximates the craftsmanship and ingenuity of the stunt work in these films. When this series began as The Fast amp; the Furious visual logic and navigability were scarce. The first film got by on energy freshness and having pulled back a curtain on a microcosm that became a world that became a universe. It was an action film that crossed the ""nothin but a good time"" spirit of a beach movie with the turf-war menace of a biker gang. But by the second film reinventing what an action sequence could do and be had become and remains a priority. For that sequence in the Caucasus the team deploys evasive formations. In Los Angeles they do lateral handoffs with a human being. Each sequence thrives on a careful mix of running plays and winging it. The corporeal and vehicular choreography aided by some visual trickery operates at a level of competency that raises the bar for an action sequence. When Brian and Dom go careering through all three Jumeirah at Etihad Towers the looks on the faces of Diesel and Walker match the looks on ours. Taking over for Justin Lin the director James Wan moves here from the gotcha-horror galaxy (Saw Insidious The Conjuring). Its a better fit than it might sound since Wan has prioritized visual coherence in action sequences of every kind. He seems to know that a kind of clarity is the surest path to both suspense and surprise. Cameras are pinned to parachutes and tipping-over sofas. But all of that motion rarely results in clutter. The four credited editors settled on clean-looking assemblages of shots. All I want from an action sequence are camera angles wide enough to keep track of bodies and cars (and choppers and drones as the case is here) and editing that doesnt feel as if its doing all the work. In these movies you can see the orchestration in the stunts. Theyve been worked out and considered not discovered -- rescued really -- in editing. Some of the editing is just playful. The first time Diesel and Statham go driving head-on at each other (there are at least three) the film cuts rapidly from Diesels face to Stathams so that you cant tell them apart. Its a hugely ejaculatory moment. These bald men are plowing toward one another but the screen makes them look like two testicles about to blow. Does it strain plausibility that Letty could hold off the high-octane arm-and-leg work of Ronda Rousey and that Brian could go forearm-to-forearm with Tony Jaa twice and live to tell? It does indeed. But thats just part of the magic. In Dubai cars fly a character played by Tyrese cant sing and when Johnson who still gets the best lines and is more tanklike than ever is laid up his hospital stay fails to reveal that hes actually a T-800. More light magic. Its the heavier variety that sticks with you like when the main cast looks on as Brian frolics with his wife and son. Its a happy strangely moving occasion since the underlying message and ensuing montage is clear The seance must conclude. If there are to be more of these films Walker wont be in them. But these compose a kind of afterlife. His characters decision to trade one family for another gives the movie an unexpected gravitas. Who would have thought that a series addicted to the high of movement could also summon a solemnity that leaves you moved?

By Peter Rainer Film critic April 2 2015 Save for later Saved About video ads About video ads View Caption of The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide The death of Paul Walker during the filming of ""Furious 7"" in November 2013 inevitably overshadows the movie which was retooled to provide the illusion that he was alive for the entire shoot. Since the movie is otherwise a turbo-charged crash-and-burn clobberfest this note of real-world morbidity makes for an unsettlingly strange combo.If a thriller is only as good as its bad guy ""Furious 7"" does a fairly good job with Jason Stathams lean and hungry Deckard Shaw whose brothers injuries inflicted by the Fast and Furious crew he aims to avenge by knocking off the crew en masse. His first encounter with Dwayne Johnson is a real thudathon. A later street fight between Shaw and Vin Diesels Dom recalls ""When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth."" Dom and his team are hired by a shady (but apparent good guy) operative (Kurt Russell) to capture from terrorists an all-seeing surveillance system called Gods Eye. In exchange they will get the assistance of a private army to bag Shaw. All of this is an excuse for scenes like the one in which the crew drive their cars out of a plane and parachute in midair. Best sequence Diesel and Walker crash a super-expensive (alas brakeless) sports car through the picture windows of not one but two Abu Dhabi skyscrapers. Presumably these scenes were done with CGI but who knows? Recommended The 50 best movies of all time The only grace note in this otherwise determinedly graceless movie is the classy way Walkers exit is handled. To say more is to say too much.

Photo Universal Pictures Having enjoyed theA Fast amp; FuriousA movies -- especially the fifth and sixth directed by Justin Lin -- as much as anyone I nonetheless settled into my seat forA Furious 7A with only one thing on my mind and I suspect it will be on your mind too Will Brian OConnor played by Paul Walker who died in a car accident off the set in the middle of shooting also die onscreen? Or will the character be allowed to go off into the sunset with his wife and kids a finish that Walker was cruelly denied in life? Adding to the poignancy is that whatever OConnors fate it will have to involve computer trickery and editing sleight-of-hand to compensate for the actors absence. Not the happiest state of mind in which to watch a crash-and-burn picture Fortunately the Fast amp; Furious films have always come with a full tank of sentimentality lately evolving into rousing odes to family -- multiracial hard-driving ass-kicking family. That evolution was in its corporate-tooled way organic. The first movie was a good rough-hewn drag-racing thriller in which FBI agent OConnor infiltrated a gang of daredevil thieves led by Dominic or ""Dom"" Toretto played by Vin Diesel; fell for Doms sister played by Jordana Brewster; and ended up throwing in his lot with the more ethical outlaws. After two unrelated sequels the gang returned with more crowd-pleasing stars and more talk of family. The big business of international blockbusting went agreeably hand-in-hand with racial harmony the family including Michelle Rodriguez Ludacris Tyrese Gibson Sung Kang and Israeli beauty queen Gal Gadot soon to be Wonder Woman. Then came Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnson as a lawman meaning that big musclebound baldy Diesel got to square off against even bigger musclebound baldy Johnson -- who ends up joining the family too dontcha know. Director Justin Lin filmed the last several F amp; F films with surprising elegance. The driving became a thing of beauty. There was emotion in motion. By the time of Fast amp; Furious 6 the proportion of crashes to hugs was roughly one to one. Furious 7 kicks the biggest and hardest but its far from the best. Lin has handed the keys to James Wan the cunning horror director of Saw and The Conjuring and though the thrill isnt gone the finesse is. Wan has a heavy workmanlike hand and a Michael Bay-like way of jump-cutting to female extras derrieres and long bare thighs -- you can almost hear the editor going ""Yow-eee"" The movie has one of my least favorite lazy premises. The baddie the team routed in Fast amp; Furious 6 has a brother whos mad as hell and coming to kill the good guys starting with Sung Kangs Han. That guy -- Deckard Shaw -- is played by the charismatic Jason Statham inexplicably minus his charisma. But he can certainly fight both fairly and dirtily (with grenades). In a good early scene he convincingly puts Johnson in traction. Furious 7 has a second plot centering on Kurt Russell (in a paycheck performance) as a government agent who engages the team to recapture a world-dominating tracking device known as ""Gods Eye."" To get it they have to rescue a genius hacker named Ramsey from the second villain played by Djimon Hounsou whos foiled more times than the coyote in the Road Runner cartoons. Ramsey turns out to be a babe played by Nathalie Emmanuel who gets a bikini scene with the camera jump-cutting to her ample bosom and long thighs while Ludacris and Gibson go ""Yow-eee"" The camera in this series has always savored hardbodies but with a little more class. The narrative setup is so threadbare its pathetic but the budget for Furious 7 is sky high -- and so literally are the stunts. There are more explosions and building collapses than the average disaster movie and an especially outlandish set piece in which a 250000 car sails from one Abu Dhabi skyscraper to another to another about a mile off the ground. Atop one of those mammoth towers Rodriguezs Letty -- an amnesiac who nonetheless remembers how to fight -- faces off against a big bruiser of a female bodyguard and though the battle is nowhere near as boffo as her airport brawl with Gina Carano in Famp;F 6 few things are better in action pictures than watching Michelle get mad. This is the sort of movie in which Johnson -- bedridden for most of the running time -- shows up at an opportune moment in the climax; Rodriguez says ""Did you bring the cavalry?""; Johnson says ""I am the cavalry""; and the audience goes ""YAAAWWWWWW"" Twice good guy Dom and bad guy Deckard stare hard through their respective windshields revving their engines before driving straight into each other. We think Which of these macho freaks has the thicker skull? Its mad fun. But that fun ends of course whenever Walkers Brian is onscreen gazing at his son and once-more-pregnant wife wondering if he should quit the perilous extended-family-vigilante business for the sake of his biological family. Over and over Furious 7 foreshadows Brians death while we try to resolve all the art-versus-life contradictions in our minds. Which would be worse seeing Brian die or seeing him live happily ever after with the knowledge that its fake? We also have to try to pretend we dont notice that the characters face is in shadow and that there are no close-ups during his final hand-to-hand fight with an especially agile henchman. I cried at the end along with many in the preview audience especially at the clip montage of Walker glowing with youth in the other Famp;F movies. The actor was apparently a good guy tireless on behalf of several charities among them one he helped to start Reach Out Worldwide. Its hard not to watch him here and thinkA Fuck race cars. Which raises another question Should I get all moralistic about the fact that the characters walk away from high-speed collisions and plunges down cliffs when one of its stars perished in a single-car crash in the passenger seat of a business partners Porsche going 90 miles an hour? Probably not. We hardly need another ""Kids dont try this at home"" message or more finger-wagging. But the difference between life and art -- wish-fulfilling blockbuster art for an audience desperate to escape -- is worth noting. It has to be noted. Furious 7 leaves you well wrecked.

John Semley Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Apr. 03 2015 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Apr. 03 2015 1200AM EDT Comments AA Directed by James Wan Written by Chris Morgan Starring Paul Walker Vin Diesel Jason Statham Michelle Rodriguez Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges and Dwayne Johnson Classification 14A Genre action Country USA Language English By about the time of the fourth Fast and the Furious film the question of ""Why does this exist?"" sort of receded. By now nobody questions these movies. They just are. They rip and roar and drift in their own little laneway flanked by roaring fans accustomed to the series cartoonish brand of modern carsploitation. Theyre not so much a part of the larger pop culture ecosystem as they are adjacent to it. Like Ernest movies. Furious 7 is the final film to feature star Paul Walker who died in 2013. It sidesteps any heavy-handed funerary air until its last act. Instead the film pays homage to Walker in faster furious-er fashion whipping straight into the high-octane action and improbable car chases that have defined the series as it morphed from a simple street-racing movie to a superhero franchise on four wheels.The villain this time around is Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) brother of the dispatched bad guy from the previous film and hell-bent on avenging his family name. Stathams presence and especially his ravenous scenery chewing in the hyperactive opening sequence bolsters Furious 7s self-conscious B-movie bona fides right out of the gate. Both Statham and the wired fast-motion camerawork of director James Wan evoke something of Neveldine/Taylors original Crank - the kind of thick-headed energy-drink action cinema the Furious movies aspire to.With their car-stealing/secret-agent gang under threat tough-guy leader Dom (Vin Diesel who looks more and more like someone Photoshopped Yul Brynners face on a steroidal California Raisin) calls up his bro (Walker) and assembles a crew of expert motorists for ""one last ride."" This involves in no particular order parachuting cars out of an airplane playing ""hot potato"" by swapping a foxy computer hacker (Nathalie Emmanuel) between three moving vehicles jumping a car between not one but two Abu Dhabi skyscrapers Diesels car basically humping Stathams car and a car being just straight-up driven off a cliff as a last-ditch ""tactic.""Its all entertaining enough I suppose. But theres a twisted coldness under the action thats anxiously concealed by the characters refrains of the importance of ""family"" and sticking together and other ostensibly nice stuff. In David Cronenbergs Crash about people who sexually fetishize automobiles (and in particular automobile accidents) one such enthusiast describes car-crash fetishism as a way of ""reshaping the human body."" Muscle and steel become one gory sinew entwined with leather tears exchanged for acrid wiper fluid.The Furious films feel like the action movies - or the live-action Saturday morning cartoons - for this cruel posthuman present where mechanization has blurred the line between man and machine. When Diesels Dom is felled in a four-wheeled fracas its surprising that the characters dont attempt to revive him by shocking him with jumper cables and jamming his heart with an syringe full of Pennzoil.At some basic level the appeal of such automotive arch stupidity is understandable. Furious 7 offers dumb easy fun and never pretends to be anything else. But the way the baseness of this entertainment can be so effortlessly calibrated to appeal to explosion-happy galoots clapping at each rev and burnout like trained seals feels a little troubling. It brings to mind another Crash quote this time from J.G. Ballards source novel.""I wanted to rub the human race in its own vomit"" says the books narrator ""and force it to look in the mirror."" The reflection offered in the puckered muscle and polished chrome of Furious 7s heroes feels like a cheery escapist distortion of a culture that more closely resembles the smashed steel mangled bone and blood and vomit of a plain ol unsexy car wreck.

""Furious 7"" whose title sounds like a bloody western revenge tale is the series most souped-up installment yet. The core cast is back in full including Vin Diesel Paul Walker Jordana Brewster Michelle Rodriguez Tyrese Gibson and Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges as well as Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson who joined two films ago when the franchise was running on fumes and kicked it into overdrive.The new film adds Jason Statham as a bad guy Kurt Russell as a shady government official ""Game of Thrones"" Nathalie Emmanuel as a super-hacker and UFC bruiser Ronda Rousey as a butt-kicking bodyguard. If thats not enough Lucas Black also makes a brief return his first since starring in ""Tokyo Drift"" the series black sheep third installment.But even with all those bodies -- its cast is the most ethnically diverse of any major franchise -- the real stars of these films are the bonkers action setpieces and ""Furious 7"" achieves new high points in that department. The script is centered around a couple of scenes so bananas they had to have been conceived inside a Red Bull fever dream Can cars skydive out of an airplane? Can they smash from one skyscraper to another? If you can dream it the ""Furious 7"" team -- which now includes ""Saw"" director James Wan in the drivers seat -- does it.In between those sequences which are true blue jaw-droppers there are some schmaltzy scenes where characters talk -- or grunt in Diesels case -- about the concept of family while setting up excuses to skydive cars out of an airplane and smash from one skyscraper to another. The motivations have something to do with Stathams character seeking to avenge his brothers death (he was killed in ""Fast amp; Furious 6"") and a mysterious Big Brother-on-steroids surveillance program called ""Gods Eye"" but coherence is not a strong point.Theres a truly ""Dynasty""-worthy subplot about Rodriguez amnesia-suffering character seeking to regain her memory and in one scene Diesel lifts up the front end of a car using his own two hands. So when another big action scene comes racing along no one is crying for the loss of smaller moments.Which is not to say the film doesnt have heart. ""Furious 7"" acts as a tribute to Walker who died in November 2013 before filming was completed. His character Brian OConner spends much of the film wrestling with settling down and giving up a life of daredevil stunt driving and the films final frames -- completed with the help of Walkers brothers -- give him a touching send-off. Yes the ""Fast and Furious"" movies are about roaring engines and speeding cars but Walker and Diesel were the brotherly blood pumping through its veins and the sentimental finish is earned.Yet while the film is Walkers last the series shows no signs of slowing. Its imaginative stunts enormous cast and thrilling sense of constant one-upmanship can keep it driving into the sunset -- or at the rate it seems to be headed to infinity and beyond.

"Furious 7 -- just roll with it dude review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesFurious 7 -- just roll with it dude reviewFurious 7 makes you want to believe that a car can fly and also that a dead man can drive. Put your brain in neutral and enjoy the ride.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. April 2 2015Furious 7Starring Vin Diesel Paul Walker Dwayne Johnson Michelle Rodriguez Jason Statham Tyrese Gibson and Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges. Directed by James Wan. Opens April 3 at GTA theatres. 137 minutes. PGFurious 7 makes you want to believe that a car can fly and also that a dead man can drive. This latter trick is the most astonishing one in this seventh chapter of The Fast and the Furious street-racer franchise.Article Continued BelowThe tragic car-crash death of lead star Paul Walker midway through filming in 2013 suggested that this would be a half-hearted salvage job at best.The late Paul Walker stars in Furious 7 although he was killed midway through filming in 2013.On the contrary while the stunts and grunts are as dumb ever Furious 7 is a remarkably satisfying and entertaining action movie one of the best in the series. Put your brain in neutral and enjoy the ride.Thanks to CGI trickery spare footage and careful doubling (by his two younger brothers) Walkers speed-demon ex-cop Brian OConner is very much at the wheel. Theres much poignancy watching him risk death in various absurd scrapes as he rejoins fellow series staples Vin Diesel Dwayne Johnson Michelle Rodriguez Tyrese Gibson Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges and others.Walkers presence seems almost supernatural something director James Wan a franchise newcomer happens to be known for. He directed the horror sensations Saw Insidious and The Conjuring.Everybody involved in Furious 7 seems determined to outdo James Bond and Mission Impossible for outlandish stunts and Transformers for urban mayhem while breaking all known laws of physics.The late Paul Walker stars in Furious 7 although he was killed midway through filming in 2013.Dont worry if youve lost track of the series which has always made about as much sense as a sandpaper jockstrap. The atrocious dialogue comes once again from the pen of Chris Morgan who scripted the previous four films.Furious 7 continues to break all known laws of physics all in service of reliably stupid thrills. In fact its only when the film tries to get really serious -- all that kissy-face stuff between Diesels bullet-headed Dom and Rodriguezs amnesia-afflicted Letty -- that it gets stuck in a rut.What began in 2001 as a story of L.A. car jockeys burning rubber and bashing skulls for the hell of it has morphed into an international espionage thriller with planet-quaking threats and a villain straight out of comic books.Jason Statham is Deckard Shaw an apparently indestructible bomb hurler who happens to be the meaner more sociopathic and extremely vengeful older brother to Luke Evans Owen Shaw the bad guy from the last movie.Not to be outdone for excess Kurt Russell joins the cast as a mysterious U.S. government operative with no leash on his budget or his mouth. He needs the speedsters led as always by Dom to help him keep an all-seeing computer snoop called Gods Eye out of the hands of terrorists and nasty foreign governments.Also new is a brainiac hacker played by the fetching Nathalie Emmanuel (Game of Thrones). She helps up the estrogen quotient of this testosterone-soaked series as does Lettys evening-gowned cat fight at a swank party. Everybody succeeds in their drive to top previous Famp;F movies. Los Angeles gets properly pummelled in the ridiculous third act when attack helicopters and fighter jets join in the madness and battle fatigue starts to take its toll. Also outstaying their welcome are Wans extreme close-ups which do no favours to aging faces especially when blown up to IMAX size.No matter really because the films earlier set pieces are the ones youll remember and talk about.They include a parachute drop of muscle cars onto twisting roads in the Caucasus Mountains of Azerbaijan of all places to penetrate the lair of a whiskered warlord (Djimon Hounsou) who currently possesses ""Gods Eye.""Another stunt shades of Tower Heist has a multi-million-dollar sports car parked in the penthouse suite of a billionaire Jordanian princes skyscraping abode in Abu Dhabis awesome Etihad Towers. Theres nowhere to go but down but Dom has a lead foot -- and maybe also a death wish. This feat alone would have a physicist want to make a citizens arrest of Wan and his crew if he or she werent laughing themselves silly.Almost as silly as anybody would be if they actually believed that Furious 7 is the ""one last ride"" promised in the poster.If death and gravity cant stop these people whats to keep them from making a Furious 8?As somebody big and bald grunts in the movie ""Its never goodbye.""The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Furious Seven | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; furious-seven ) Furious Seven (United States 2015) April 02 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli Furious Seven provides what viewers have come to expect from the long-running The Fast and the Furious series a string of high-octane physics-defying action scenes loosely connected by a narrative that occasionally makes rudimentary sense. This time around however real-life events dampen the films fun quotient. The untimely death of Paul Walker looms large. Every time Walkers character Brian OConnor walks on screen were reminded of that. This lends a poignancy to the proceedings that none of the other The Fast and the Furious movies have had. Despite a major change at the top - horror movie maestro James Wan (Insidious The Conjuring) replacing Justin Lin in the directors chair - the franchise doesnt lose a beat. Like Lin Wan leans heavily on computer generated imagery to realize stunts more spectacular than anything practical effects could achieve. The problem with using animation to this degree is that although the ""wow"" factor may be amplified things are too smooth and clean to generate real tension. Consider for instance a scene in which a car sails across the gap between two high rise buildings. It looks great in the trailer and even better in the movie but no one in the audience is even a little worried that things might not turn out alright. So we admire the artistry of the moment but dont feel an inkling of concern that the characters might die. The story picks up where Fast 6 ended with badass Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) deciding to take revenge on the Fast and Furious group for the death of his brother. An ex-black ops ""asset"" Shaw is an expert at staying under the radar. Hes a ghost who leaves a trail of dead bodies. Furious Seven opens with a bang (several of them actually) as Deckard first goes after agent Hobbs (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) sending him to the hospital (although not the morgue as was his goal) then blows up the house of Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) while his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) and best buddy Brian (Walker) are visiting with their young son. For a while Furious Seven is a hunter-and-hunted story with Deckard targeting Dom and his crew Brian; Doms amnesiac girlfriend Letty (Michelle Rodriguez); and two others computer whiz Tej (Ludacris) and ""comedy relief"" man Roman (Tyrese Gibson). Before the halfway point however a mysterious government agent played by Kurt Russell enters the proceedings and Dom Brian and the others end up in the middle of a James Bond movie complete with a beautiful woman (Nathalie Emmanuel) and a vicious terrorist (Djimon Hounsou). During the films second half Deckard becomes an afterthought who occasionally shows up to take pot shots at Dom. Furious Seven tries to do some character building. It is most successful with Brian who feels torn between the high-adrenaline ride he gets with his friends (""he misses the bullets"") and his responsibilities as a father and husband. Although Walkers death adds an unintended layer to some of those scenes its clear the movie was originally scripted to retire Brian - or at least provide Walker with an ""out"" if he wanted to step away. The story also restructures the romantic relationship between Dom and Letty (which was fractured by her ""death"" and loss of memory) but many of those scenes feel like filler. Early in the proceedings it looks like Jason Statham is going to provide a top-notch villain but the intelligence and ruthlessness he shows diminishes as his character slips into the background. Of the other newcomers Kurt Russell leaves the strongest impression as a spook whos probably hiding more than hes telling. Nathalie Emmanuels Ramsey is reputed to be one of the worlds best computer hackers but the characters spends a lot of time emulating a damsel in distress. Djimon Hounsou apparently having watched a few too many Roger Moore James Bond movies stares daggers and froths at the mouth. Viewers who come for the spectacle will get their moneys worth. Furious Seven is all about action with some scenes being more inventive than others. Staying true to its pedigree the film offers a variety of fast vehicles and high-speed chases. The crashes including an instance of chicken in which no one blinks are satisfyingly loud with bits of twisted metal flying in all directions. There are several mano-e-mano clashes modeled after Schwarzengger/Stallone fights from the 80s no matter how hard someone gets punched kicked or clobbered they come back for more. In fact Dwayne Johnson seems to be channeling one or both of those action icons. Furious Seven ends on an elegiac note paying tribute to Walker with more than just the ""For Paul"" dedication. During these moments the film nudges close to crossing the fourth wall. Some of the scenes featuring Brian that were completed after Walkers death (using a combination of body doubles and CGI) are well-handled although one fight scene is unsatisfying. The franchise will undoubtedly move on - plenty of groundwork is laid for future installments - but its doubtful the tone will match that of Furious Seven when off-screen tragedy is reflected in a moving and non-exploitative fashion on-screen.

Every now and then this seventh edition of the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise cuts away from the chase for mano-a-mano combat (the most energetic of these interludes involves Vin Diesel and Jason Statham two hulks wielding tire irons) for stupendous explosions (a parking structure falls like a house of cards a cell tower tumbles like a sapling) or for emotionally charged flashbacks.

Comments (1) click to enlarge Furious 7 Video Rated PG-13  137 minutes  2015 James Wan (Saw Insidious) directed this seventh installment of the Fast and the Furious series demonstrating once again that he doesnt give a fig for anything more than blunt sensationalistic effects. The story takes place in LA Abu Dhabi Tokyo and the Caucasus Mountains yet Wan has so few ideas about how to choreograph and edit action that the elaborate stunt sequences all feel exactly the same. The characters are basically automatons this time around their chief function being to operate neat-looking vehicles and hang from high places. The movie concludes with a brief tribute to Paul Walker who died during production; the effect is jarring because this is the first time in over two hours that the film has displayed any interest in individuals.

Winds light and variable. Updated July 30 2016  153 am Full Forecast News Sports Business Go Life Buy/Sell Movie reviews Furious 7 is running on fumes By Joe Williams / film critic / joewilliamspost-dispatch.com Joe Williams Apr 2 2015 (...) The ""Fast and Furious"" franchise jumped the shark in episode 5 at precisely the moment when our hot-rodding heroes plowed through a block of Brazilian storefronts without batting an eye at the collateral victims. It not only jumped the shark it snagged it with a grappling hook strapped a nitro booster to its tail fin and rode the thing to an alternate universe where the laws of physics dont apply.Like its slightly more preposterous and enjoyable predecessor the best way to appreciate ""Furious 7"" is as a purely mechanical fantasy with no relation to real human behavior. Never mind the tear-jerking coda in which the producers pay homage to the late co-star Paul Walker; they already proved they could raise the dead in ""Fast amp; Furious 6"" when they cynically resurrected the left-for-dead Letty (Michelle Rodriguez).That episode ended with a minor characters death and a tease to a sequel featuring Jason Statham as the villain. Here we learn that hes an ex-British commando named Deckard Shaw and hes the vengeful brother of the villain in the previous movie. Shaw is gunning for Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his crew of street racers and his first stop is the super-cop complex in Southern California where agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) knows their whereabouts. Consumer alert After tussling with Shaw Johnson-as-Hobbs bows out of the movie for the next 90 minutes. A parallel storyline is that a spy-agency spook who calls himself Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) needs Toretto amp; Co. to free a hacker named Ramsey from a Somali terrorist (Djimon Hounsou). Ramsey has developed an eavesdropping software that can track anyone in the world. If Toretto helps Mr. Nobody get the software for the feds theyll use it to find Shaw. And yet moments before he makes his pitch to Toretto Mr. Nobody allows Shaw to scamper away unmolestedNonsensical plots are as integral to the ""Fast and Furious"" series as bulletproof beefcake and street-racer groupies in thong bikinis. Here the story takes them from their LA clubhouse where pregnant Mia (Jordana Brewster) again encourages Brian (Walker) to go have fun with the boys to Azerbaijan where they slalom down mountainsides in their indestructible muscle cars and discover that Ramsey is a British babe (Nathalie Emmanuel) to Abu Dhabi where they party with infidels and catapult a million-dollar Maserati between towers of a high-rise. Thats an awfully long road to a desultory death race in downtown L.A. By now the pressure to top the previous movies has popped the hot-air from this franchise. The grunted catch-phrases the implausible escapes the plot holes the size of the Bonneville Salt Flats -- its all pitched at a particular audience like a dog whistle that fully grown humans cant hear. If you dont crave the taste of motor oil on your popcorn ""Furious 7"" cant end fast enough.What ""Furious 7""  Two stars out of four  Run time 217  Rating PG-13  Content Prolonged sequences of violence action and mayhem suggestive content and brief strong language Joe Williams  314-340-8344Film criticjoethecritic on Twitterjoewilliamspost-dispatch.com Film interrupted When the star dies mid-shoot directors get creative Replacing fallen stars like Paul Walker involves body doubles and digital effects.

Vin Diesel pays tribute to Paul Walker at Furious 7 premiere We have officially entered the baroque stage of the Fast amp; Furious franchise. Its no longer enough that the films fleet of tricked-out turbo-boosted muscle cars drive really really fast. Now they also have to fly. In the numbingly bonkers Furious 7 cars parachute out of cargo planes jump from one skyscraper to another and sail through the air to intercept helicopters. At this rate the next chapter will have to take place in outer space. Fast amp; Furious Venusian Drift. So hows the movie? Well its both awesome and ridiculous. The acting is mostly lame the dialogue is entirely laughable and the story makes absolutely no sense. Picking up where its (better) 2013 predecessor left off Vin Diesel Paul Walker and their diverse gang of gearheads reassemble when Jason Statham playing the brother of the previous films villain (Luke Evans) goes on a bender of payback. Since this was already the premise of Die Hard 3 director James Wan and writer Chris Morgan pile on a mess of pointless subplots and secondary bad guys like Djimon Hounsous high-tech terrorist and his martial-arts henchman (Tony Jaa). But the kernel is this In order to hunt down Stathams Deckard Shaw before they can be hunted the crew agree to help a shadowy government agent (a winking Kurt Russell) retrieve a surveillance gizmo that will make Shaw easier to find. Heres the thing though--he isnt hard to find at all. In fact he keeps popping up wherever they go (Azerbaijan Abu Dhabi Los Angeles). So why they need Russell or his gizmo is anybodys guess. And yet none of that matters. No one forks over 10 bucks to see one of these flicks for its logic. We go for the bananas demolition-derby mayhem. Furious 7 delivers that with the direct visceral rush of an EpiPen. For two hours and change were treated to a high-octane orgy of some of the most exhilarating stunts ever put on film including one showstopper where Walker balances on an overturned bus thats teetering on the edge of a cliff. If the masterminds behind this series were honest with themselves--and the audience--theyd eighty-six the idea of making another feature-length sequel with all of its soap opera hooey about Michelle Rodriguezs amnesia and crank out a 30-minute stunts-only supercut of just the good stuff. It would solve a lot of problems for folks who get hung up on old-fashioned notions like narrative coherence...and it would make a billion dollars. Furious 7 is of course dedicated to the memory of Walker who died before filming was completed. The biggest surprise in the movie is how poignantly and tastefully it pays tribute to the star who by all accounts was as devoted a family man off screen as he was on it. In the final scene the actor looks directly into the camera and flashes his thousand-watt smile from behind the wheel. Its a rare moment of subtlety in a franchise that otherwise has no use for it. And its as cathartic as any car flying through the air could ever be.

(Scott Garfield/Universal Pictures) By Jen Chaney April 2 2015 Follow chaneyj ""The Fast and the Furious"" movies have elicited various emotions during their nearly 14 years (so far) of existence. Those feelings include souped-up Dodge Charger envy Michelle Rodriguez resurrection confusion and various states of magnificent car collision awe. But this remarkably resilient Vin Diesel-goes-vroom-vroom franchise has rarely struck a note of genuine poignancy. That changes with ""Furious 7"" which unleashes the usual cockamamie car chases and Imax-ready explosions but also earnestly marks the final performance by Paul Walker. The actor -- who plays Brian OConner a.k.a. the pseudo-brother/partner-in-crime to Diesels Dominic Toretto -- died in a 2013 car accident an event that felt particularly tragic since he was primarily known for a street-racing film series featuring the catchphrase ""Ride or die."" [Paul Walker died while filming Furious 7. How did other movies handle the sudden loss of a star?] Not surprisingly the loss of Walker who had shot a solid chunk of ""Furious 7"" before his death hovers over much of the movie particularly during a flashback-filled tribute to the star that gently ruptures the fourth wall between fiction and reality. On more than one occasion longtime fans might find themselves getting misty. But more often its their adrenaline not their tears that will be flowing. ""Furious 7"" plays to the sagas over-the-top action strengths perpetually ratcheting things up a few notches even when it seems like all notch possibilities have been exhausted. In classic ""Fast"" tradition there are ultra-intense fights in which bodies are flung into a dazzling array of glass surfaces; chase scenes in which cars tear through traffic career down mountain ranges and even parachute-jump out of airplanes; and sequences in which 3 million smart cars leapfrog among a trio of Abu Dhabi towers far taller than the Empire State Building. The seventh movie in the ""Fast amp; Furious"" franchise features actor Paul Walker who died while the latest installment was still filming. (Universal) [The Fast and Furious franchise is so much better than you think. Heres why.] Through it all both Diesel -- whose vocal register continues to emanate from somewhere several sedimentary layers below the Earths surface -- and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson utter lines that rival the 80s-era output of Arnold Schwarzenegger. When Rodriguezs Letty asks whether Hobbs (Johnson) is ""bringing in the cavalry"" to assist in a dire situation the Rock responds the way only he can ""Woman I am the cavalry."" As usual the plot of a ""Fast"" movie seems almost beside the point. But if you must know After the loss of a friend and the bombing of his familys home Dominic goes on the hunt for the man responsible. Thats Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) the older brother of bad guy Owen Shaw who was targeted by Dominic and Co. in ""Fast amp; Furious 6."" This Statham vs. Diesel rivalry -- which involves brutal fistfights and multiple games of vehicular chicken -- could have provided enough fodder for the movies narrative. But because ""Furious 7"" screenwriter Chris Morgan and director James Wan (""Saw"" ""The Conjuring"") believe in going either crazy big or crazy bigger there is a second interconnected plot that involves Kurt Russell the U.S. governments desire to recover a tracking device dubbed Gods Eye and the Toretto crews involvement in retrieving said device which forces them to participate in dangerous missions that always begin with Roman (Tyrese Gibson) the franchises go-to source of comic relief saying things like ""Im all for winging it but this is crazy"" [The Fast and the Furious series started with a (true) story in a magazine] Yes the whole movie feels overstuffed and overlong and the non-action scenes are often dragged down by stilted dialogue. But ""Furious 7"" buzzes with a frenetic energy so contagious theres no sense in resisting it. Like its predecessors this film has no shame about being its high-octane gloriously ridiculous self. Its also not afraid to sentimentally and respectfully honor Walker. That combination doesnt make the movies more absurd moments seem remotely realistic. But it does give ""Furious 7"" an authenticity deserving of respect. Chaney is a freelance writer. PG-13. At area theaters. Contains prolonged frenetic sequences of violence action and mayhem suggestive content and brief strong language. 137 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

"Furious 7 review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review Furious 7 Furious 7 Universal Pictures Paul Walker in ""Furious 7"". Paul Walker in ""Furious 7"". (Universal Pictures) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune The franchises ongoing tribute to fossil fuel consumption bids goodbye to Paul Walker. Under the hood were all Vin Diesel trying to live a meaningful life a quarter-mile at a time. Yet the film series begun in the pre-9/11 era with ""The Fast and the Furious"" has sustained itself through weak sequels and exuberant ones and has become not a drag race but the Indy 500 of the movies a reliable if repetitive ode to fossil fuel. Keep it coming pal. Well tell you when weve had enough.""They say the open road helps you see where youve been ... and where youre going."" So says Diesels character Dom to Letty his amnesiac honey played by Michelle Rodriguez early in the new movie ""Furious 7."" For a thundering action franchise these diversions always have had their sincere soul-searching side in between cars ramming each other head on or plummeting down mountains or here in one of my two favorite insane bits Diesel and company drive five cars equipped with parachutes out of the back of a plane flying high over the Caucasus Mountains (played by the Rockies) which then hit the ground running at high speed in pursuit of a ruthless mercenary (Djimon Hounsou) in possession of the all-powerful surveillance device known as ""Gods eye."" This epically ridiculous aerial sequence explains why even with its dull stretches and hacky maniacal editing rhythms ""Furious 7"" does the trick. Its roughly as realistic as Georges Melies ""A Trip to the Moon"" of course. But revisiting our old pals (one of whom is played by an actor who is no longer with us) and watching them survive one unsurvivable collision or plunge after another continues against the odds to have a walloping charm all its own.My other favorite insane bit in ""Furious 7"" finds the gang in Abu Dhabi (played by Abu Dhabi). A surveillance device stolen by a dishy English hacker (Nathalie Emmanuel of ""Game of Thrones"") has fallen into the hands of a Jordanian prince who lives in a very high high-rise where he keeps his car (). The device is in the car the car requires stealing and at one point Diesel drives it through the windows and sails hundreds of feet midair. The bit goes on just like the beat but well draw a veil so you can discover the trajectory for yourself. Avenging his brothers death as depicted in the previous ""Furious"" Jason Stathams character is a bullet-headed Special Ops assassin out for blood. Kurt Russell joins the ensemble as a Mr. Big man who wears nice suits and genuinely enjoys his work or seems to because Russell brings such a welcome lightness of touch to his expository load. He assembles the street racers (Diesel Walker Rodriguez Tyrese Gibson and Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges) for the heist of the Gods eye thingie which the gang will then use to find Stathams character before its killin time. After so many thrillers designed to stoke audience paranoia about omniscient surveillance practices its refreshing to see a film thats really into it. Furious 7 Scott Garfield Universal Pictures Paul Walker in ""Furious 7."" Paul Walker in ""Furious 7."" (Scott Garfield Universal Pictures) Walker died in a car accident in late 2013 midfilming. His scenes were completed using doubles i.e. two of his brothers and the trickier prospect of digital face replacement with footage of his face replacing that of his doubles. In some medium shots and close-ups Walkers expression remains eerily still and calmly neutral; the rationale I think is that its less attention-drawing that way. The Walker we see on screen in ""Furious 7"" for lack of a better term is the best that money could buy. And the undertow of the farewell of friends parting can be felt throughout the film. The coda acknowledges Walkers death with a montage of dialogue-free shots of the actor from earlier films in the series. It shouldnt work but it does and though director James Wan exhibits none of the stealthy patient camera instinct exhibited in his best earlier work lower down on the budget scale (""Furious 7"" reportedly cost 250 million) he does make time for the occasional rest stop and reflective moment. Its all about family as were told throughout and being there with huge automatic weapons when needed as illustrated by Dwayne Johnsons presence in ""Furious 7."" SXSW Surprise Furious 7 screening met with tears by Paul Walker fans Mark Olsen Who would have thought that a ""Fast amp; Furious"" movie would inspire tears?

The unlikely franchise that has brought in more than 2 billion worldwide... (Mark Olsen) There will be more ""Furious"" films starting with one scheduled for 2017 possibly marking the return of Justin Lin the series most talented director so far. ""Furious 7"" is not as zippy as ""Fast Five"" my favorite of the ones Ive seen but it has its satisfactions; its global audience is built-in as well as strapped in and ready to ride.

Larry the Cable Guy Justin Bieber Spam. To that cavalcade let us add the likable repetitive chaotic ""Furious Seven."" This follow-up to the sequel to the sequel to the sequel to the sequel to the sequel of the launch of the high-octane adventure yarn is dumb enough to bring Chuck Norris to weeping. Its also enjoyable especially if you like multiple car wrecks brawls beyond counting fiery pandemonium and cameras focused on women in skimpy bikinis. The series runs on turbocharged adrenaline not brain fuel. Above all it is durable like the cars it sends through metal-smashing street races in every film. When launched in 2001 ""The Fast and the Furious"" introduced the catch phrase for Vin Diesels motorhead speed demon Dominic Toretto ""I live my life one quarter-mile at a time."" At this point its miraculous the long-running franchise isnt kaput in a dead end its audiences and producers equally exhausted. Yet like two-year-old Parmesan these cheesy action spinoffs improve with age. If you saw ""Fast amp; Furious 6"" -- would you be reading this if you didnt? -- you need no analysis of the opening here. At the end of the last film we met British mercenary Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) who vowed revenge against Toretto and his teammates for the death of his brother. Having killed one of their colleagues in Tokyo he appears in Los Angeles fighting Diplomatic Special Services uber-agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) with knuckles then gunfire then explosives. Why the villains of the series always begin with their lowest-caliber weapons then slowly work their way upward is never explained; perhaps they are tied to deficit-cutting austerity budgets. Giving Statham a leading role in the new escapade is excellent casting. Like Johnson who joined the ensemble in 2011s ""Fast Five"" Statham has the kind of charisma that improves any film he appears in whether or not they make sense. There are celebrity pop-ups here by rapper Iggy Azalea Ultimate Fighting Championship star Ronda Rousey and Thai martial-arts ace Tony Jaa but Statham becomes the backbone of the story (if you would call it a story; screenwriter Chris Morgan who scripted the past five episodes is no master wordsmith). Popping up around the globe to crush Doms dream team of drivers he moves them to a MacGuffin subplot that like the previous film involves a top-secret government microchip. Video (0227) Trailer Furious 7 A mysterious CIA type (Kurt Russell) directs them to track down the gizmo from a nefarious mercenary (Djimon Hounsou) with the promise that they can use it to locate Shaw. Their route takes them from Azerbaijan where they drive their speedsters out of a high-flying Air Force transport to Abu Dhabi where Dom and his good pal Brian (the late Paul Walker) send a supercar smashing through three of the sky-high Etihad Towers. While the car chases play like live-action cartoons the man-to-man battles (or woman-to-woman when they feature Michelle Rodriguez as Doms thought-dead/magically revived/now-amnesiac wife) contain some of the wildest tough stuff since the Gilded Age of kung fu. Walker who died in an unrelated car crash while the film was shooting in 2013 receives a fond presentation here. Stunt doubles and CGI images of Walkers facial features carry him through scenes incomplete at his death from a tottering bus about to fall from a mountain cliff to sweet moments with his characters wife (Jordana Brewster) and their toddler. The importance of family is a standard theme of the ""Furious"" films as Diesels growling bass voice pauses from threatening enemies to praise the clan he values above all. Its an idea that stumbles badly here once with a road race launched in the midst of a solemn funeral even worse later when a near-dead character is saved not with cardiopulmonary resuscitation but by a character who halts it to bring him back with lovey-dovey sweetheart talk. But the feeling for the late star is genuine. The cast and filmmaking crew offer a touching farewell right down to the end credits dedication ""For Paul.""

But what the fuck it is -- the family being the audiences that have stuck with this car-porn franchise thick and thin since the first chapter in 2001. And the family of actors and crew who have gathered here to pay tribute to one of their own. More News Fast and Furious Star Paul Walker Dead at 40 Peter Travers on the Worst Movies of March Conjuring Director James Wans Favorite Horror Movies All Stories >> Related Michelle Rodriguez My Life in 10 Movies The Furious 7 star gives it up for Disney Paul Newman and Pulp Fiction ""Its impeccable."" That would be Paul Walker who plays Brian OConnor the undercover cop who infiltrated an outlaw gang of East L.A. street racers run by Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and stayed to form a bond. Walker 40 died in a high-speed car crash on November 30th 2013 in the passenger seat of a 2005 Porsche Carrera GT that hit trees and a concrete lamppost. With only half of Walkers scenes finished at the time of his tragic death it took an act of will to decide the fate of Furious 7. After taking time to grieve Walkers brothers Caleb and Cody stepped up to fill in for scenes that digital grafting couldnt cover. Tough job. It had to look seamless. And it pretty much does. Furious 7 is the best Famp;F by far two hours of pure pow fueled by dedication and passionate heart. This one sticks with you. The usual flaws -- plot bumps muscle acting tweet-length dialogue -- fade in the face of the camaraderie on and off screen. Finishing the film in Walkers honor clearly brought out the best in everyone. Its bittersweet seeing Walker in action again. But its also a kick to watch him take the wheel or hang off a bus in Azerbaijan that happens to be hanging off a cliff. He feels at home. Home of course is where Furious 7 starts. Back in L.A. Brian finally looks uncomfortable with a moving vehicle. Thats because its a suburban minivan he uses to pick up his girl Mia (the ever- stellar Jordana Brewster) and their infant son. Mia tells her brother Dom she loves having her family reconnected. But she admits that Brian ""misses the bullets."" Thats the cue to bust loose for horror director James Wan (Saw The Conjuring Insidious) expertly taking over the drivers seat from four-time Famp;F honcho Justin Lin. Serenity vanishes when Doms house is blown up by Deckard played with menacing glee by Jason Statham. In no time Brian Dom his amnesiac love Letty (Michele Rodriguez is killer) and their tech-wiz comic cohorts Tej (Ludacris) and Roman (Tyrese Gibson) are on the road to global vengeance. Hell that bastard Deckard has put FBI agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) in the hospital. Newbies to the cast include a welcome Kurt Russell as covert government operative Mr. Nobody who wants the Famp;F crew to enter the terrorist lair of Mose Jakande (Djimon Hounsou) and snatch Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) a computer hacker whos invented a software program called Gods Eye that can track anyone anywhere via the simplest digital devices. In exchange they can use Gods Eye to find Deckard. Got that? Doesnt matter. Chris Morgans chronology-jumping logic-defying plot doesnt matter a damn next to the breathtaking stunts and action. Theres a hell of a head-butting fight between Diesel and Statham and a knockout scene of buckled-in drivers being parachuted onto a mountainside. And you wont believe your eyes as Dom drives a priceless Hypersport out of the 80th-floor window of an Abu Dhabi skyscraper and into another. Brians words echo in his ears ""Cars cant fly Dom cars cant fly."" Well they do here. The filmmakers have figured out an ingenious and graceful way to give Brian a happy ending of sorts. If youve given your heart to Walker and the Famp;F crew you cant help but well up. If you believe theres no crying in car racing take a star off my rating. But my guess is that if Gods Eye is tracking Walker somewhere hell be smiling.

"Furious 7 (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Furious 7 (PG-13) The latest installment in the popular Fast and the Furious franchise sputters and stalls. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com4/2/2015 Editor rating 2 In Furious 7 the unstoppable Fast and the Furious franchise sputters and stalls edging from spectacular tongue-in-cheek B-movie fun to soulless insulting inanity. Here is a film in which nothing is at stake Cars crash into each other head-on at high speeds vehicles sail off cliffs and tumble down rocky mountainsides people jump out of buildings and fall six stories to the ground then characters just dust themselves off and continue as if nothing had happened. Even Wile E. Coyote wasnt  this resilient. Thats not to imply the previous films werent far-fetched. Fast Five which remains the best entry to date centered around one of the most preposterous heists in cinematic history and the previous installment Furious 6 ended with that now-legendary chase sequence on an airport runway that seemed to be as long as the Florida peninsula. The series secret weapon has always been the cheerfully lunatic manner in which the movies tear through the edges of plausibility with a nudge and a wink letting you in on the joke while putting on a grand show. But the law of diminishing returns sinks Furious 7 in which the filmmakers succumb to the trap of having to top each successive film -- bigger louder dumber -- by plunging free-fall into absurd cartoonish nonsense. James Wan inheriting the reins of the money-minting series from Justin Lin (who directed parts three through six) shows little of the ingenuity he used in his low-tech hugely effective horror pictures (The Conjuring Insidious). He doesnt even pull off a single setpiece as effective as his long single-take footchase between Kevin Bacon and a gang of thugs in a parking garage in the underrated Death Sentence. Instead Wan seems to have taken some crash courses at the Michael Bay University of Filmmaking where you never do anything for real when you can fake it with computers and where no idea is deemed to be too much as long as the special-effects crew can put it up on the screen. Realism is for documentaries and stuff. This is a popcorn movie man Its supposed to be stupid right? At this point screenwriter Chris Morgan doesnt even care about viewers who are unfamiliar with the series. Hes only interested in preaching to the converted since the previous films have grossed more than 2.3 billion worldwide. As long as the old fans show up this giant-budget (a reported 250 million) spectacle wont have any problem recouping its costs. The film practically does away with traditional scenes of dialogue and plot development in part because these characters who were thin to begin with have been stretched to their limits over seven movies now. The actors are essentially playing fictionalized versions of themselves (faring particularly badly are Tyreese Gibson and Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges two dynamic entertaining performers who are given little to do except spout exposition and lame jokes). As the film starts Michelle Rodriguez is still suffering from amnesia -- she doesnt remember how much she loves Vin Diesel. Paul Walker and Jordana Brewster are getting used to life as parents (Brewster is sidelined for the movie with a baby in her arms). Jason Statham the brother of the previous films baddie has come looking for payback and is in the process of taking our crew of heroes down one by one (Statham gets the best entrance although even his considerable magnetism is muted here). New characters include Nathalie Emmanuel as a genius hacker Kurt Russell as a shady government agent and Djimon Hounsou as a villain with dreams of ruling the world and fond of spouting ""What?"" ""What?"" and ""WHAAAAT?"" Outside of Russell whose weathered craggy face and impish energy inject some much needed human fun into the movie the only other actor who fares well is the indestructible Dwayne Johnson reprising his role as a crackerjack federal agent. He infuses life and warmth into the picture whenever hes onscreen -- a natural comedian Johnson is capable of being self-effacing and bad-ass at the same time as in a shot in which he flexes his way out of an arm cast -- and youll wish even more than before that he and Diesel could trade places on the Furious totem pole and Johnson would take over the wheel. Maybe next time. Furious 7 is comprised of a string of enormous loosely-linked action setpieces includes a phenomenal sequence in which the heroes parachute out of an airplane while inside their cars; a vertigo-inducing chase on mountain roads; an I-dare-you-not-to-smile-at-this bit of business involving a limited-edition Ferrari that sails through the air and crashes through not one but two skyscrapers; and some good old-fashioned one-on-one throwdowns. But the film is also padded with unnecessary montages soul-deadening dialogue (""You made it I cant believe we pulled that off"") hoary cliches (including the requisite jackknifing 18-wheeler carrying a load of large cylindrical objects) and a protracted finale in which half of downtown Los Angeles is destroyed that is better suited to an Avengers movie than a film about former car thieves and drag racers turned charming superhuman rogues. Walker who has always been the series humble solid center (he counterbalances Diesels raspy-voiced tough-guy cartoon) died tragically while the film was still in production which explains why the credits list four editors and two cinematographers. There are also chunks in the picture in which the actor is only shown from the back. The movie ends with the requisite ""For Paul"" dedication but before that the filmmakers engage in a bit of shameless exploitative manipulation including some computer-generated images intended to bring the film to a sentimental close and pay tribute to Walker. I wish the producers would have honored him with a better movie. You wont fall asleep at Furious 7 but the new picture returns the series to the unfortunate place where it started - a ridiculous junkheap of hollow fleeting thrills polished to a high sheen and cranked up to 11.

If that sounds like a great way to spend two hours and 17 minutes read no more.On the other hand if you like a little bit more in a movie -- say characters that are mildly interesting or a plot thats a wee bit logical -- stay far away.Maybe thats no surprise. Its not like ""The Fast amp; Furious"" franchise is filled with gems; instead theyre dumb potboilers that have gotten increasingly bloated and self-important. Let me repeat This movie is 137 minutes long emphasis on long.In this outing Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his pals do battle against a revenge-seeking assassin (Jason Statham). Throw in a computer hacker (Nathalie Emmanuel from ""Game of Thrones"") and a mysterious agent known as Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) and you have a lot of characters running around hanging off buses and jumping from car to car.Dwayne Johnson brings a certain twinkle to his role as a special agent and Emmanuel boasts a snappy fun presence. Otherwise the performances fall in place with the lumbering presence of Diesel who woodenly recites every line in a rumbling basso profundo that suggests too many cigarettes and late nights. Then again with such lines as ""Thats the thing about street fighting The street always wins"" the skills of a Kenneth Branagh arent really necessary.Co-star Paul Walker famously died in 2013 during production in a car crash. The movie was completed using outtakes from previous films and stand-ins including Walkers two brothers. ""Furious 7"" ends with a dedication to the actor and a sentimental montage is used to send off his character. Director James Wan (""Insidious"") handles the matter about as tastefully as a fan could want.Furious 71.5 stars (out of 5) Director James Wan.Cast Vin Diesel Paul Walker Dwayne Johnson Jason Statham.Rating PG-13 for violence action suggestive content and strong language.Reach the reporter at randy.cordovaarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8849.

""You got me"") hyperactive camerawork ridiculous stunts and plot holes you could drive a car through. Which the characters do regularly. I mean its the kind of movie in which the endlessly antagonistic villain and hero express their boiling hatred by driving head-on into each others rides. At high speed. Twice. Which is pretty much the way ""Furious Seven"" approaches its audience too - you will watch and you will like this. Or at least be too shocked and assaulted to look away. And if you do well hit you. But ""Furious Seven"" isnt boring. Its over-the-top action scenes are both absurd and kind of terrific. And it even manages an end-of-movie sendoff to Paul Walker that may leave you feeling a little teary. It was Walkers horrible senseless death - in a speeding car - which seemed to end this film before it had even finished shooting. (Whether it should have gone on is another question.) But director James Wan (whose earlier special-effects heavy movies included horrors like ""The Conjuring"" and ""Insidious"") used careful editing stunt stand-ins and even quick doubling by Walkers brothers to finish the scenes. So lets get the obvious question out of the way Will you notice? Probably not. Theres one fight where Walkers face is regularly in shadows; in another scene one of his closeups seems to be re-used and the final sequence employs some computer-generated trickery. But its all smoothly done and although theres some painful irony - Walker is constantly talking about his addiction to excitement and Tyrese Gibson complains theyve lost too many friends - fans can mostly concentrate on the adventure at hand. Its a pretty good one too bringing on Jason Statham as the vengeful brother of the villain from the last film. Hes out to take revenge on Vin Diesel and his crew and he starts by blowing up Diesels house. Not a good idea. But the film pleasantly complicates things by bringing in Dwayne Johnson (reprising his role as Diesels frenemy federal agent) an international terrorist and even Kurt Russell in a plum guest-star part as someone called Mr. Nobody. Oh and Michelle Rodriguez is back as Letty too still struggling with amnesia - but not so distracted she cant have an all-out fistfight in heels and an evening gown. Not everything works. Jordana Brewster is packed off early to the Dominican Republic to be a mommy and stay safe; Gibson is never going to be funny no matter how hard the franchise tries to make him ""the funny one."" And Wans direction is both energetic and empty. Simple phone conversations have the camera circling the characters in 360-degree pans. The go-to cliches of old MTV videos - slowly whirling industrial fans gratuitous girls in thongs - fill too many scenes. Wans better though when he has a chance to legitimately show off as in the many action scenes. In fact the stunts are so insane - driving parachute-equipped cars out of airplanes is only the beginning - all you can do during most of this movie is simply laugh. And maybe at the end - as Diesel talks about ""his brother"" and we get a quick roundup of clips from the other movies and the boyish Walker flashes that grin at us one last time - even grow a little teary. And you know you should. Because if you dont this movie might just punch you in the face. Ratings note The film contains violence. Furious Seven (PG-13) Universal (137 min.) (PG-13) Universal (137 min.) Directed by James Wan. With Vin Diesel Paul Walker Jason Statham Michelle Rodriguez. Now playing in New Jersey.

Its touching and -- heres a word that has likely never been used during this franchises 14-year history -- incredibly classy. PHOTOS Pauls life Until then. . . . ? Buckle up for a high-octane fast-paced adrenaline rush that revels in its own ridiculousness. Nobody will ever confuse this with a Best Picture Oscar nominee (no matter how hard Vin Diesel tries to sell it as such) but it deserves props for delivering exactly what fans crave. Bonus Its no big deal if you havent seen a Fast amp; Furious film since the 2001 original (uh if you catch my Tokyo Drift). Walkers ex-cop Brian OConner dragsters Dom (Diesel) and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) have all now joined forces and theyre joined by characters played by Ludacris and Tyrese Gibson. Meanwhile Brian is now married to Doms sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) and they have a child. Dwayne Johnson also returns as the groups connection in law enforcement albeit his role here is more of a glorified cameo. Paul Walker and Vin Diesel in ""Furious 7"" Scott Garfield/Universal Pictures PHOTOS Stars who gained or lost weight for roles This time the gang is targeted by a baddie (Jason Statham) -- whos the brother of the baddie they pummeled in installment No. 6. And this guy is serious about staking revenge Within the first 20 minutes he plants a bomb outside Doms house and goes mano a mano with Johnson. To track the baddie down our heroes must first find a gizmo that can hack into every Smartphone on the planet and rescue a kidnapped hacker. All this convoluted nonsense is just a means to stage dazzling vertigo-inducing stunts. In a wildly fun whirl the guys ride off the side of an airplane in-flight crash a car through the glass windows of the Etihad Towers in Abu Dhabi and motor through the streets of L.A. PHOTOS Stars gone too soon Meanwhile they toss off lines such as ""I am the cavalry"" and ""Daddys got to go to work"" Theyre so dumb and cliched that its a wonder how the actors recited them to the camera with straight faces. Yet the audience in my screening lapped them up. And why not? If you want a flat self-serious and heavy-handed slog in this genre go see The Gunman. (Director James Wan could have reined in the babes-in-bikinis slow-mos and close-ups though. Obviously the film is aimed squarely at dudes but did Wan have to make his onscreen dudes do so much ogling? This isnt supposed to look like a Furious film spliced in with lost scenes from Girls Gone Wild.) Tyrese Gibson Michelle Rodriguez Paul Walker and Ludacris in ""Furious 7"" Scott Garfield/Universal Pictures PHOTOS Best and worst movie remakes The goal is to enjoy the fun and not fixate on the eerie parallels of Walkers 2013 car crash. And admittedly its difficult to do so as Brian sheds tears during a friends funeral promises his wife that this is his last mission and argh rides shotgun in a sleek sports car with faulty brakes. You see Walker and his gleaming smile lights up the screen and the mind wanders Is this stock footage? When did he film this? Is Brian headed for doom as well? Indeed Walker might not have been the flashiest star of this franchise but he represented its soul. And you better believe that hes going to be missed in the inevitable eighth edition. But its heartening to know he gets a touching send-off that stirs fond memories -- and lets his costars pay their respects as well. When Diesel talks solemnly about the importance of his ""family"" the sentiment is achingly sincere.

Universal Studios Universal Studios Universal Pictures Furious 7      (out of five) Director James Wan Cast Vin Diesel Paul Walker Dwayne Johnson Rated R (prolonged frenetic sequences of violence action and mayhem suggestive content and brief strong language) Running time 137 min. By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 136pm on Thursday Apr. 02 2015 Thursday Apr. 02 2015 Thursday Apr. 02 2015 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Furious 7 the newest model in the careening yet indestructible ""Fast amp; Furious"" franchise is directed by a guy better known for corpses than cars.Australian James Wan came up in the horror ranks and gave the world the first Saw as well as Insidious and The Conjuring. But if ""Famp;F"" fans feared that he would tamper with the box-office formula and end up slaying and gutting this cinematic golden goose for shocks and giggles they can rest easy. Furious 7 just may be the best in the line. And thats quite an accomplishment considering that Fast amp; Furious 6 is hard to top; and one of his stars Paul Walker was killed in a non-filming-related car crash as Furious 7 was in production.While Wan working from a script by Chris Morgan and Gary Scott Thompson leaves his scare tactics at home he still brings a revved-up sense of energy and kinetic choreography. That certainly helps when working with material thats as dim-witted as drywall and loud as a Texas thunderstorm. A good action scene -- and there are many of them here -- can make up for a multitude of storytelling sins. (And its not in 3D in the US always a plus.)The film picks up where 6 left off with federal agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) recovering in an L.A. hospital while the other crime fighters try to get on with their lives. Brian (Walker) is struggling to get used to domesticity with his wife Mia (Jordana Brewster) and young son. Dominic (Vin Diesel) is reconnecting with girlfriend Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) who was seriously injured in an earlier film and suffers major memory lapses.But trouble just wont leave them alone. It comes in the brutal form of Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) the avenging brother of the now-dead villain from 6. Hes a renegade British black-ops agent which means hes both irredeemably evil and able to go toe-to-toe with the best drivin and fightin skills our guys can muster.Hes going after the team one by one killing member Han (Sung Kang) in Tokyo and sending a bomb to Dominic. Meanwhile a secret government agency fronted by Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) wants Dom and his crew to help them get back a brilliant and beautiful hacker Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) who was kidnapped by forces working for terrorist mastermind Jakande (Djimon Hounsou). Ramsey has designed a breakthrough global surveillance system that must not fall into the wrong hands. If they help Mr. Nobody nab Ramsey he will help them with Shaw.So Dom gets the band back together -- including tech wiz Tez (Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges) and would-be ladies man Roman (Tyrese Gibson) -- for one more mission. From there its a chase around the world from L.A. to Tokyo Azerbaijan to Abu Dhabi and back to L.A. but its really just an excuse for elaborately staged stunts in exotic locales. The vehicular dance of death along twisty roads in Azerbaijan alone is worth the price of admission as its the stuff of action-fan fever dreams especially since it pits Walker against Thai martial-arts star Tony Jaa of the cult-favorite Ong-Bak movies.Speaking of Walker there is a sense of sadness that hangs over the film especially in a scene where his cars brakes are failing or when hes saying goodbye to his wife. In the wake of Walkers death his brothers and CGI were combined to digitally reimagine him in certain scenes he left uncompleted. Though it seems like a crass idea the process never appears obvious or fake. Then just when it looks like Furious 7 is lurching along on fumes as it descends into the usual third-act action-movie exploda-palooza its Walker who saves it. Wan turns the last few minutes into a tribute to the actor showing shots from previous ""Famp;F"" films and sending theatergoers out with a lump in their throats.Perhaps this would be an appropriate time to pull the key out of the ignition on this whole phenomenon to go out on a poignant fuel-injected high. But no the eighth movie is in the works.With Furious 7 looking at a potential 275 million opening weekend worldwide this is one franchise thats unlikely to run out of gas.

EntertainmentMovies Furious 7 Hard-driving action ends with a touching tribute Originally published April 2 2015 at 1205 am Updated April 29 2015 at 258 pm A movie review of ""Furious 7"" The seventh entry in the large-men-and-fast-cars franchise is breathless fun and includes a touching tribute to the late Paul Walker. Rating 3 stars out of 4. Share story By Moira Macdonald Seattle Times movie critic Having presumably run out of surfaces on the ground the mad driving crew of ""Furious 7"" resort to backing their cars off a plane and clutching their steering wheels while driving er falling through thin air. Why do they do this? Because its fun ... to watch that is. The seventh entry in the large-men-and-fast-cars franchise directed by James Wan (taking over from Justin Lin who steered the last few editions) delivers the goods and then some. The action sequences include the aforementioned paradriving (I guess thats what youd call it); an escape from a bus delicately teetering on a precipice; a snappy red roadster gleaming like teeth flying from building to building; an elaborately collapsing parking garage; a lot of Thelma-and-Louise-ish driving off cliffs; and Dwayne Johnson ripping a cast off his arm simply by flexing his muscles. (I bet he does this at parties.) All are breathless crazy fun; all should be watched on the largest screen possible. As usual the plots of little importance. Theres vengeance involved as the very scary Shaw (Jason Statham seen briefly at the end of ""Fast amp; Furious 6"") is quite ticked off at our beloved driving gang for killing his evil brother. Theres family loyalty and theres amnesia (Michelle Rodriguezs hard-driving Letty still struggles with her memory) and theres parenthood and theres ... well a lot of moody lighting and Vin Diesel purring out his lines in a voice that sounds as if not-quite-melted metal was poured into a velvet-lined percolator and even a mysterious unseen choir that chimes in during a fight scene. Everyone drives around a lot (except Johnson who spends much of the movie lying attractively in a hospital bed exposing his manly pecs) and nobody among this Rasputin-like crew ever sustains serious injury despite their habits of frequently getting beaten up crashing their cars and falling out of things. Movie Review    Furious 7 with Vin Diesel Paul Walker Dwayne Johnson Michelle Rodriguez Tyrese Gibson Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges Jordana Brewster Djimon Hounsou Kurt Russell Jason Statham. Directed by James Wan from a screenplay by Chris Morgan. 137 minutes. Rated PG-13 for prolonged frenetic sequences of action violence and mayhem suggestive content and brief strong language. Several theaters. And looking at Paul Walkers dazzling smile in the film you wish the real world worked that way just a bit. Walker only 40 died in 2013 in a crash -- off duty as a passenger in a speeding car. Though his work in the film wasnt quite finished Wan and the production crew were able to seamlessly complete his performance by using old footage body doubles and CGI work. The last few minutes in ""Furious 7"" (dedicated simply ""For Paul"") are a touching tribute to him as his character Brian sweetly exits the franchise choosing another road. Drive safely Brian -- and everyone. Most Read StoriesThinking of voting for Jill Stein or Gary Johnson?

Photo Scott Garfield Furious 7 is creepy and long 1 / 5 Back to Gallery If ""Jaws"" were made by the people who made ""Furious 7"" it would be 137 minutes of shark attacks -- no suspense no human interest just blood in the water followed by blood in the water and then blood in the water. The action comes so fast and furious in ""Furious 7"" that for all the explosions and overturned cars and missiles fired on downtown Los Angeles it becomes a dull muddle. Here and there we get the imaginative and outrageous stunts this series is famous for but mostly the movie plods along muscling through without much life or spirit. We shouldnt be surprised. Paul Walker died midway through shooting and in retrospect it seems a mistake to have gone ahead and completed the film. At the very least the way in which they chose to make ""Furious 7"" seems crazy and macabre. Instead of killing off his character or writing him out of the picture the filmmakers apparently used body doubles (Walkers brothers) to whom they attached Walkers face through computer imaging. The problem is its incredibly obvious when Walker is really there and when hes not. Hes alive for example throughout the long sequence in Abu Dhabi. Hes talking hes present hes active as a full-fledged co-star. But for most of the movie hes just off to the side with a glazed goofy expression on his face as though saying ""Dont mind me Ill just stand here being dead if you please."" Though done with the intention of preserving his work and honoring his memory this reanimation of Walker does a disservice to the actor turning him into a cyberzombie and forcing him into a bad performance. His reactions -- found reactions pasted onto someone elses face -- are invariably wrong or at least a little off. Plus whenever people talk to him except in Abu Dhabi they do all the talking. He just grunts or smiles or says yes or no. To say this takes you out of the movie isnt enough. It takes you out of the movie and then makes you imagine Walkers death (in a car crash) and then further reminds you that the other actors supposedly looking at him are actually people who have recently attended his funeral. Its creepy in a way movies have never been creepy before. And as this technology improves this may be the herald of more creepiness to come. The story picks up almost immediately after ""Furious 6"" in which Dom (Vin Diesel) and his gang of race car drivers helped save London from a mad terrorist. Now the terrorists even worse brother (Jason Statham) is out for revenge which sounds like the makings of a good action movie but is in fact a comedown. Last time millions of people were at stake. This time only a few racing enthusiasts are targeted for destruction. But the sluggishness of imagination is most apparent in the action scenes themselves. A revealing moment comes when Dominic finds himself with his back to a cliff and the front of his car blocked by about 10 parked cars with guys pointing guns at him. What will he do next? If youve seen the other movies in the series you get ready for something amazing. But no. He just turns his car around and drives off the cliff. Thats his escape plan. Or more accurately thats the screenwriters escape plan. Why paint your lead character into a corner if you havent figured out how to get him out? Perhaps its no coincidence that the best action sequences in ""Furious 7"" involve Walker. Theres a scene in which he has to escape a bus thats about to fall from a great height and another crazy moment in which he and Diesel drive a car through the three Etihad Towers in Abu Dhabi. But those are really the only two scenes in ""Furious 7"" that have the old ""Fast amp; Furious"" magic. The movie contains an epilogue of sorts in which Dominic (but really Diesel) talks in an elegiac way about having to leave his best friend Brian (but really Walker). Its weird and awkward but its an authentic moment that comes closest to acknowledging the technological artifice and making art out of it. But by then were already more than two hours into a failed experiment and theres no turning things around Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

"Review Furious 7 fires fuel-injected fun on all cylinders - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Furious 7 fires fuel-injected fun on all cylinders Scenes from ""Furious 7."" Betsy Sharkey Furious 7 soars with high-octane action airborne muscle cars and an emotional final ride for Paul Walker ""Furious 7"" is the fuel-injected fusion of all that is and ever has been good in ""The Fast and the Furious"" saga that began in 2001 with souped-up cars and a stripped-down story about a tightknit East L.A. street racing crew.Though 2006s ""Tokyo Drift"" the third in the series will always remain for me the one in which the films find their footing in ""Furious 7"" they learn how to fly. In every sense.The always-fabulous autos spend much of the time airborne in stunning heart-dropping effects. But it is in the handling of heartfelt sentiment that ""Furious"" truly soars as the on-screen and off-screen family gives one of their own -- Paul Walker who died in a car crash in 2013 as ""7"" was filming -- a near-perfect final ride. The all-important foursome of mostly unknowns that kick-started things in 2001 is back and once again keeping the focus on family Vin Diesels Dom Toretto the head of the crew; Michelle Rodriguezs Letty as his street-racing main squeeze; Walker as former undercover cop Brian OConner who has become a brother in arms now brother-in-law as well marrying Doms sweet baby sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) and starting a family in ""6.""

Its not every action film that can boast of having dropped a fleet of racing vehicles from a C-130 aircraft flying 10000 feet over the Arizona-Nevada border. But ""Furious 7"" director James Wan a newcomer to the fast-car franchise wanted to make a statement with one of the sequels key heist... (Gina McIntyre) It goes without saying the most significant is linked to Walkers tragic death. Morgan and James Wan in the ""Fast"" directors chair for the first time handle it creatively and deftly steering clear of letting things turn maudlin or exploitive keeping the overall tone in sync with the past while shaping the franchise for the future. Between scenes of Walker shot before his death footage from previous films CGI wizardry and stand-in help from Walkers brothers Caleb and Cody Brian OConner is very much in the movie as he always has been. The action sequences -- from hand-to-hand combat to the crash and burn of cars -- are as weve come to expect not grounded in reality. The parkour-influenced high-rise stunts that everyone will be talking about are particularly affecting because a) they feature the multimillion-dollar eye-candy of a jewel-encrusted limited-edition Lykan Hypersport and b) they are amazing. All of the driving and skydiving fall into the never-try-this-at-home zone.Though Im not sure it is possible to top the Letty-Riley (Gina Carano) catfight in ""6"" the designer gown face-off between Letty in a red stunner by costume designer Sanja Milkovic Hays and the ultimate party bouncer played by UFC champ Ronda Rousey in a skintight floor-length golden Herve Leger gets close.But the money shots come in the knockdowns between Dom and Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) exploiting the fighting skills of mixed martial arts expert Statham. An extended battle of flying fists kicks and tire irons on top of an L.A. parking lot is the centerpiece but throughout stunt veteran Joel Kramer and fight choreographer Jeff Imada go fierce. And a shout out to the entire production team including directors of photography Stephen F. Windon and Marc Spicer visual effects supervisors Michael J. Wassel and Kelvin McIlwain and production designer Bill Brzeski.All the favored players are there including computer whiz Tej (Chris Ludacris Bridges) and Brians fast-talking juvie buddy Roman (Tyrese Gibson). Agent Hobbs hasnt exactly throw in with Doms crew but their interest in outlaws increasingly coincides. In ""Furious"" it is Stathams rogue black-ops killer whose now-comatose brother (Luke Evans) was one of the main targets in ""Fast amp; Furious 6."" Shaw starts a revenge streak that puts Doms Tokyo brother-in-arms Han (Sung Kang) six feet under Hobbs in the hospital and blows Doms house to smithereens. Anyone who rides with Dom is on Shaws hit list.There is another villain as well a bunch of international mercenaries led by Djimon Hounsous Jakande which means Azerbaijan ends up on Doms flight-fight plan. With Hobbs temporarily side-lined -- half his body is in a cast -- a new shadowy government figure code-named Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) turns up to join forces with Dom.Besides getting even everyone in ""Furious 7"" wants to locate an illusive hacker named Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) and the ""Gods Eye"" an all-powerful Internet location tool Ramsey designed that puts GPS and Google mapping to shame. Between the various villains and multiple agendas ""Furious "" two-plus hours of metal-twisting and bone-crunching occasionally feels a little long. But every time youre about to say ""Enough already"" it shifts gears.Much of the credit for the mostly smooth ride must go to the director Wan who is known for bringing some 21st century stylistic oomph to horror in ""The Conjuring"" and ""Saw."" He has not been shy about leaving his imprint on the franchise. The emotional connections between the actors can really be felt far more in ""Furious 7"" from the lip-lock between Dom and Letty -- finally -- to the glances passing between Dom and Brian that become exactly what youd imagine between real-life close friends Diesel and Walker. Wan taps into a softer side of his ripped cast and especially his two leads -- one living one gone -- without ever letting things get mushy. So much so that when the films ending comes even hard-core ""Furious"" tough-guy fans might be tempted to shed a tear.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com ------------Furious 7MPAA rating PG-13 for prolonged frenetic sequences of violence action and mayhem suggestive content and brief strong languageRunning time 2 hour 20 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Reviews Movies Entertainment Mixed Martial Arts Paul Walker James Wan Jason Statham Fast and Furious at the box office Posthumous productions Fast amp; Furious 7 to get fancy with Iggy Azalea cameo Furious 7s insane car drop from on high adds fuel to action fire SXSW Surprise Furious 7 screening met with tears by Paul Walker fans Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad71deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-furious-review-20150402-column.html#navtype=outfit,200,furious730,furious7,latimes

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The Fast And Furious series may have grown and mutated in directions no one could have anticipated nearly 15 years ago but give the franchise some credit It never forgets its roots. Although the globe-trotting three-ring circus of ambitious action climaxes on display in Furious 7 bears little superficial resemblance to the small-scale street-racing thriller The Fast And The Furious the 2001 original is the subject of multiple callbacks flashbacks and in the end tearful reflections. The series has long established itself as particularly adept at sly retcons and continuity maintenance--since the fourth film every entry has featured at least a few dramatic entrances and/or exits. But paying homage seems especially important this time around because its the last film that will star the late Paul Walker as Brian OConner the former cop (and later former FBI agent) so transfixed by the street-racing world of Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) that he permanently joined his ragtag crew knocked up Torettos sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) and embarked on all manner of dangerous heists rescues and revenge missions.Those adventures continue in Furious 7; despite the nods at series history this is not a back-to-basics enterprise. The film finds a settled Brian Mia Dom and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) hunted by Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) the lethal and unstoppable older brother of the bad guy from Fast amp; Furious 6. In the end credits of that film Shaw was retconned into responsibility for the death of Han (Sung Kang) and near the beginning of this one he mounts an ill-advised but surprisingly effective attack on the towering sweaty mountain of Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) with his sights set on the rest of Doms makeshift family. As Dom initiates counter-revenge measures a mysterious government operative called Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) steps in with an offer that includes all of the tenets of a latter-day Fast movie rolled into one rescue a kidnapped hacker and heist the hackers all-powerful computer program and hell help the gang (also including as ever Tyrese Gibson and Ludacris) get revenge on Shaw.In other words Russell provides the means and the excuse for Furious 7 to try topping the fifth and sixth films in nutty commitment to big-scale action and insistent defiance of petty trifling gravity. To that end cars chase each other down mountains Dom drives indoors and then out a window and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson fights Jason Statham among other stunts. To briefly describe these sequences does little to spoil their giddy ingenuity. Though the Fast cycle remains more gimcrack and flashy than the suspense-driven Mission Impossible series it shows similar facility with joyfully elaborate set pieces.Notably the man in charge of those set pieces this time around has changed for the first time in about a decade James Wan takes over for Justin Lin who directed parts three through six. Wan has shown a flair for slow-burn camera work in horror movies like Insidious and The Conjuring but here he largely adapts to the Fast house style. If anything some of the filmmaking is slightly less elegant than in Lins films the close-ups are a little tighter the cuts are a little faster and a few long pans during exposition scenes look like theyve been chopped up (maybe by one of the films four editors). Amusingly the director of the original Saw does slip some of his favorite low-rent exploitation imagery into the big-budget proceedings. Several late-movie confrontations take place in and around a parking garage and a dimly lit warehouse and multiple scenes include large industrial fans spinning slowly in the background just as one did in the John Goodman scene from Wans Death Wish re-do Death Sentence. Wan also adds a signature fight-scene move where the camera locks on a subject as he or she flips falls or slams to the floor tilting along with the body in motion. He pulls this trick at least four times (Furious 7 has a lot of fight scenes all pretty great) and it never wears out its welcome.Like all of its predecessors Furious 7 has peculiarities and problems that arent fully absorbed into the intoxicating silliness like hiring the talented Djimon Hounsou to play a bad guy only to give him dialogue that consists largely of screaming ""What?"" and ""Fire"" at his lackeys. Elsewhere in the villain lineup Statham is well deployed in fights but doesnt get much of a chance to chew on gloriously ridiculous dialogue the way Johnson does. As effective as the film is at gathering action icons it sometimes feels like a fantasy camp for the less physical members of the cast Ludacris sheds his tech-expert role to dole out an inexplicable beatdown and due respect to Paul Walker but hes no hardcore action fans idea of a dream match-up against Tony Jaa the dexterous star of Ong-Bak. A little flattery seems in order though; Walker died before production on Furious 7 was finished. (His work was completed with stand-ins including two of his brothers and computer effects and the seamlessness of these techniques dispels natural fears of uncanny creepiness.) The films ensemble sprawls less than previous installments--some supporting players feel more slotted in than usual--which allows the movie to focus on Dom and Brian whose relationship is more the heart of the series than any conventional romance (though Diesel and Rodriguez also share a substantial romantic subplot). Furious 7 most differentiates itself from its predecessors by unexpected necessity parlaying the films incessant talk of loyalty and family into a touching tribute to Walker delivered with rumbling sincerity by that old softie Vin Diesel. The series will doubtless continue on with Diesel Rodriguez Johnson and the rest but in the meantime Furious 7 comes to the most conclusive and emotionally satisfying ending since fittingly the very first film.

Paul Walker who died in a 2013 car accident stars in Furious 7 the latest entry in the Fast and Furious franchise.(Photo Universal Pictures via AP)The freewheeling Fast amp; Furiousfranchise is at the top of its game with its latest far-fetched go-round. Furious 7 offers edge-of-the-seat excitement with outlandish action sequences inventive stunts hilarious cartoonish moments and even some touching emotion (   out of four; rated PG-13; opens Thursday in select theaters and Friday nationwide).Sure there are plenty of eye-rolling moments Vin Diesels acting skills consist mostly of glowering. The movie can be deafening with amplified sounds of cars revving. Its wide-ranging gravity-defying plot rarely makes sense. And yet what it offers in spades is pure adrenaline-infused fun.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Paul Walker died when he was only halfway done shooting Furious 7 but the movie was was finished seamlessly without him. USA TODAYs Carly Mallenbaum talks about how the film was completed and how it pays tribute to Walker. Director James Wan (The Conjuring) and the returning cast wink at the audience with self-mocking one-liners delving deeper than ever into fantasy with jaw-dropping car stunts. On the gentler side the movie offers a lovely lump-in-the-throat tribute to the affable Paul Walker killed in a car accident in November 2013.Lines of dialogue and plot points can be painful reminders of Walkers death at age 40. As Brian OConner he talks about yet another funeral and his wife Mia (Jordana Brewster) urges him not to say goodbye as if he will never see her again. These scenes simultaneously take the viewer out of the movie make it even more poignant and underscore lifes fragility. Known mostly for his horror films Wan is new to the franchise and acquits himself well. It helps of course that the cast is back and that screenwriter Chris Morgan responsible for the last four films is also on board. Much of the dialogue by Dominic Toretto (Diesel) and FBI agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) consists of classic Furious one-liners.Holed up for days in a hospital ICU (though he hardly seems in critical condition) Hobbs flexes his considerable muscles and tells his young daughter ""Daddys got to go to work.""When Walker died the film was only half completed. But filmmakers have digitally fused Walkers face onto stand-ins (including Walkers brothers Caleb and Cody) and artfully incorporated footage from previous films.Its bittersweet to see the handsome blue-eyed actor (particularly looking so young in flashback footage) as he gives his all here. Scenes of Walker smiling and looking carefree in the final scenes offer a tasteful subtle memorial.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare A dead mans brother seeks revenge on the Toretto gang. VPCIts not worth spending much time on the not-so-subtle plot. Bad guy Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) is after the car-racing protagonists. His menacing scowl puts Diesels one-note glare to shame. Hes seeking revenge for an attack on his brother (Luke Evans) from the previous movie. Also involved in the mayhem is a vaguely-affiliated terrorist (Djimon Hounsou) and a computer hacker (Nathalie Emmanuel).The takeaway here is cars flying skimming through the air as if winged. Several are released from a cargo plane over the Caucasus Mountains -- with the drivers buckled inside -- in free-fall until their parachutes open. In Abu Dhabi a pricey sports car goes airborne gracefully flying among three shiny skyscraper towers. Furious is not just about souped-up cars however. Its also about camaraderie and loyalty. Though it never makes it a focal point the franchises ethnically diverse cast -- which includes Michelle Rodriguez Tyrese Gibson and Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges -- is a wonderful example for Hollywood of how most films should look.The credits offer a funny disclaimer urging audiences not to try the dangerous vehicular stunts at home.""All stunts were performed in controlled environments with professionally trained stunt crews on closed roads. No attempts should be made to duplicate any action driving or car-play scenes herein portrayed.""As if. 2584 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 7 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1CydpCh",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/04/01/furious-7-review/70732130/,200,furious732,furious7,usatoday

Paranormal abilities are about the only thing lacking for the folks played by Vin Diesel Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson Michelle Rodriguez and the rest of the team (or family as they like to call it) of the ""Fast amp; Furious"" franchise. Not that it all isnt fun to watch. It is. And that along with the touching send-off at movies end for Paul Walker -- who died in a car crash during a break from filming the movie -- makes ""Furious 7"" the perfect way to end the franchise if thats what the studio decides.But if it is over -- wow what a wild and oftentimes ridiculous way to go.Fans already know suspension of disbelief is key to enjoying the ""Fast amp; Furious"" movies. They dont make sense nor are they supposed to. If you expect to learn something witness great acting or become a better person watching these movies youre missing the point. About the only lasting impact is that youre far more likely to get a speeding ticket on the way home.""Furious 7"" is about explosions and logic-defying stunts and fast loud muscle cars and brave characters uttering defiant one-liners in the face of death. It is perhaps the ultimate proof that a ridiculous movie and a good movie arent mutually exclusive. Get your popcorn strap in and enjoy the ride even if youre laughing most of the way at what writers Chris Morgan and Gary Scott Thompson jam into the script. To be fair some of the humor such as the interplay between Roman (Tyrese Gibson) and Tej (Ludacris) is intentional and well-timed.Advertisement What separates ""Furious 7"" from other logic-defying boomfests such as the tired ""The Expendables"" franchise is that director James Wan (""Saw"") keeps the action fun and the characters fresh. The multiethnic cast is depicted as genuinely caring for one another which lapses into thick cheesiness at times but these arent actors who can fake it that well. They must really like each other which helps immensely.That said ""Furious 7"" still causes plenty of eye-rolling. This time around the gang goes up against Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham playing Jason Statham) an angry and tenacious former British special forces soldier intent on getting revenge for his hospitalized brother. Just when you think hes the only fly in the ointment here comes terrorist/mercenary Jakande (Djimon Hounsou) who kidnaps brilliant hacker Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) and an ""Eye of God"" surveillance device that makes NSA hardware look like a Pong game. Some government agency -- does it really matter which one? -- represented by wisecracking Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell obviously enjoying himself) puts our heroes to work getting Ramsey back. What follows one-liners parachuting cars one-liners people jumping between speeding cars explosions one-liners shooting cars purposely plummeting off cliffs one-liners explosions computer hacking karate fighting between women in formal wear and an eye-popping stunt exceeding even parachuting cars (think supercars and three giant Abu Dhabi towers). This photo provided by Universal Pictures shows Vin Diesel as Dom Toretto in a scene from ""Furious 7."" (AP Photo/Universal Pictures Scott Garfield) ( Scott Garfield ) The action somehow returns to the streets of Los Angeles where Diesels Dominic goes mano a mano with Deckard while Hounsous Jakande patrols overhead in a military chopper firing huge guns and demonstrating incredibly bad aim. Meanwhile Johnsons Hobbs sees the action from his hospital bed and intent on joining the fray removes his cast in perhaps the silliest (and funniest) moment in action-movie history. More explosions and unexplainable things happen before it all gets sorted out.Well maybe it gets sorted out and maybe it doesnt. The door to an eighth ""Famp;F"" is left wide open.Knowing its Walkers last movie creates a shadow of sadness among all the snarling fun. Its stunningly ironic how his character spends most of the movie being torn between his young family and his love of being shot at as if he had wanted this to be his last ride.All of which really means the ""Famp;F"" door should be shut. The tribute to Walker in the films final moments is goosebump-inducing and regrettably the perfect way for the series to go out.

First though Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) has to arrange a rendezvous with his current nemesis Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham). They meet under an L.A. highway -- Doms beloved 69 Dodge R/T Charger growling at Deckards Aston Martin DB9 -- and steer their vehicles into a high-speed head-on collision. Boom It looks like mutually assured destruction but nobodys seriously hurt. Its really just a workout for a couple of testosteronic gearheads doing what manly men do best -- crashing the cars they love. The Fast and Furious movies -- those odes to torn asphalt crunching car-nage auto-eroticism and as the characters kept insisting family values -- have often shown a cavalier attitude toward death. Moviegoers in the theater must pretend that they are cocooned by film fantasy that this universe is one that courts fatal impact without ever making good on the threat that may await audience members from some highway maniac on the drive home. That blithe belief endured a toxic hit on Nov. 30 2013. Paul Walker who had played undercover cop Brian OConner since the original 2001 The Fast and the Furious died when the Porsche Carrera GT driven by Walkers friend Roger Rodas a financial planner and amateur racer crashed into a Valencia Calif. light pole at a reported 80 to 90 m.p.h. igniting the car and killing both men. The stars sudden death at 40 put a halt to the Furious 7 shoot and left series screenwriter Chris Morgan with two dreadful dilemmas how to work Walkers footage into a revamped movie and how to keep romanticizing the series theme -- speed thrills -- when it was also painfully evident that speed kills. Furious 7 opening nine months after the initial July 2014 release date proves how splendidly if preposterously movie fiction can trump human tragedy. Without stinting on the greatest hits of the earlier films it underlines the first law of cinema that movies -- and the people stories and machines in them -- have to move collide combust. Secure in this knowledge 7 meets the demanding standards of the two previous entries the crazy-great Fast Five (2011) and its amped-up purified sequel Furious 6 (2013) while providing a tender onscreen farewell for the fallen Walker. Its an enormous steroidal blast and as much ingenious fun as a blockbuster can be. James Wan the Saw and Conjuring magician who succeeded Justin Lin director of the previous four entries says he chose the Furious 7 title as a reference to Akira Kurosawas 1954 martial epic The Seven Samurai. Here as there rugged souls do humanitys dirty work for the satisfaction and the fun. But in the Furious cosmos these seven include two women. Brian has gone domestic with the foxy Mia (Jordana Brewster) and Dom is reunited with his lost love Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) still stricken with a telenovela case of amnesia. Tej (Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges) the computer whiz and Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson) the resident motormouth are joined by federal agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) who enlisted back in Fast Five and infused the skein with his cartoon gravitas. As if to challenge the audiences stomach for stark violence in a PG-13 film Furious 7 begins with the fiery almost Walker-like death of one of the series regulars (Sung Kangs Han) and the totaling of Brians and Mias home. The villainous Deckard is supposed to be avenging the incapacitation of his brother Owen (Luke Evans) the prime bad guy from Furious 6 yet as he leaves Owens hospital he blows up his bro and the building that houses him. But this is just a crash test for sensitive viewers. The series long ago expanded from a drag-strip Gotterdammerung to a globe-circling showcase for spectacular stunts in exotic locales. The plot a CIA shadow who calls himself Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) wants the gang to corral some computer MacGuffin guarded by an IT genius named Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel Game of Thrones Missandei) whos been kidnapped by Deckard and pan-African warlord Jakande (Djimon Hounsou). Honestly though who cares? Ramsey is just the excuse for the group to infiltrate an Azerbaijan forest redoubt and recover the van that holds her. This sensational second-act chase ramping up to Walkers Brian in a literal cliffhanger would be the climax of any other action picture but its just a why-not escapade to keep you from going for popcorn during the movies two-hour-plus nonstop assault. On we fly to Abu Dhabi where Dom and Brian hijack a sheiks W Motors LykN Hypersport vroom it out of the 50th floor of an Etihad Tower skyscraper and into the adjacent high-rise -- and then again into a third building before our heroes land somehow intact. ""Cars cant fly"" Brian keeps saying but Furious 7 refutes all aeronautic logic with its next stunt which one-ups the skydiving Elvises from the old movie (and the Broadway musical) Honeymoon in Vegas by dropping five members of the team and their cars 10000 feet from a C-130 military transport. (Auto coordinator Dennis McCarthy who deployed about 250 vehicles for the movie insists that this was no illusion the cars truly did float to earth most of them safely.) By the end of the movie back in L.A. youre not surprised when a car can serve as surface-to-bad-guy-in-helicopter missile. In such a buoyant enterprise as this gravity is for wimps. Retaining one sweetly anachronistic element of the series the cast goes not just fender-to-fender but fist on fist bulk on bulk hulk on hulk. Tough-guy franchise mavens Statham and Johnson mix it up in a fracas that leaves Hooks incapacitated for half of the movie -- until he rises from his sick bed cracks open his arm cast and mutters ""Time to go to work."" Rodriguez tangles with MMA Medusa Ronda Rousey and Walker (or his stunt-double team) staves off a wondrously savage attack from Tony Jaa the Muy Thai Warrior. As much as Furious 7 flirts with scenarios from The Avengers in its heart it still wants to be Fight Club. No series with the worldwide box-office horsepower of this one -- 2.4 billion so far with a bonanza awaiting the release of Furious 7 -- wants to imagine its own demise. So in its closing credits each of the recent episodes has introduced a new villain for the next installment. Diesel a Furious producer and guiding light has said he sees 7 as the first in a third trilogy. (In strict chronology the series is a kind of terrestrial Star Wars in that the fourth through sixth films were one long flashback beginning at the end of the 2006 Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift; Hans death at Deckards hands brings the story back to the present.) Russells presence as Mr. Nobody may point toward future chapters but 7 has no end-of-film tease. It must send its dead co-star on a verklempt trip to Valhalla. In the series multiracial retinue of toughs Walkers Brian was the one WASP solid citizen. If the dark glowering Diesel was the franchises engine the blond Walker provided the ethical brakes -- yin to Vins yang. Though the early films emphasized the near romantic charisma of this complementary couple in Fast Five and Furious 6 Walker was really a supporting character ornamental but not essential to the series grand grit. Yet Brians mulishness and recklessness sometimes hinted at a desperation in completing his mission. In the first film when Dom doesnt yet know that Brian is an undercover cop Walker tells an FBI agent ""I just need some more time."" The agent snaps ""If you want Time buy the magazine."" Finally Walker ran out of it. But not Brian. Making judicious use of outtakes CGI work and model-doubling from his younger brothers Caleb and Cody the 7 filmmakers fully integrated the actor into the film. Their improvisatory skill and their feeling for their friend give his final moment a sleek poignant unforced grace. In a series that consistently elevates B-movie car crashes and smashes to state-of-the-art epiphanies its only appropriate that a departed star should be able to cruise off to placid immortality. <a href=""http//time.pinnion.com/pepl/webWidget.php?id=12980amp;key=MzkxZGY3MTA1MWU5YmVhNGRhZmNjYjEyZTMyOWFkYjE.amp;al=1amp;qPos=32"">TIME 100</a> Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

Never mind that the film repeatedly presents the impossible - a muscle car attacks an airborne helicopter - fans of the franchise know to suspend disbelief at the door. With nonstop action from start to finish its easy - if a bit exhausting - to go along for the high-speed ride. Paul Walker died in a car crash in 2013 while the film was still in production. Vin Diesel left as Dom Toretto and Jason Statham as Deckard Shaw in ""Furious 7."" Universal Pictures ""FURIOUS 7"" starring Paul Walker Vin Diesel Dwayne Johnson Jason Statham Michelle Rodriguez Jordana Brewster Kurt Russell and Tyrese Gibson. Directed by James Wan. Written by Chris Morgan and Gary Scott Thompson. A Universal Pictures release. Rated PG-13 for prolonged frenetic sequences of violence action and mayhem suggestive content and brief strong language. Running time 220 Search photos available for purchase Photo Store - Reality intrudes at the end The film is dedicated to Paul Walker who died in a car crash in 2013 and concludes with a montage of images of the actor from his five previous ""Fast and Furious"" appearances. Walkers brothers acted as stand-ins and special effects were used to maintain his presence throughout his final film which was still in production when he died. There are a couple of creepy allusions to his death in the film that could briefly jar viewers. At one point Roman (Tyrese Gibson) asks Brian (Walker) to promise their team wont face any more funerals. When Brian replies ""Just one more"" hes referring to that of the films villain (Jason Statham) but one cant help but think of the actors own accidental death. Another scene shows Brian telling wife Mia (Jordana Brewster) that if she doesnt hear from him after the crews latest mission she should ""move on."" It almost feels like a message to his co-stars. Like its predecessors the seventh installment of the hit franchise features a multicultural cast international settings and a dazzling array of cars. While this critic is partial to American muscle cars the 3.5 million Lykan Hypersport from Dubai-based W Motors is incredible to see. Only seven such vehicles exist. (No Lykan Hypersports were harmed during the making of the film.) The story is just a framework for car chases and fight scenes. Dom (Vin Diesel) and his crew are acclimating to life on the right side of the law when theyre attacked by Shaw (Statham) bent on avenging the death of his brother who was killed in ""Fast amp; Furious 6."" Shaw is elusive and the crew needs help. Theyre approached by secret operative Mr. Nobody (a smiling and smarmy Kurt Russell) who promises to aid in taking out Shaw if Doms crew can secure a breakthrough tracking device for the U.S. government. Meanwhile a group of mercenaries led by an underused Djimon Honsou is also willing to kill for the tracking device which can locate anyone on the globe by hacking into myriad digital networks. Directed by James Wan (""Saw"" ""Insidious"") ""Furious 7"" scores with unprecedented car stunts. A cargo plane drops various parachute-equipped cars onto a curving road in the Caucasus Mountains. Amazingly all the cars land upright where they are supposed to. Hilariously Dom and the others are shown ""steering"" the vehicles as they fly through the air. Another awesome sequence shows a sports car crashing through glass windows as it jumps from skyscraper to skyscraper in Abu Dhabi. When the characters arent in their cars theyre fist-fighting and Wans shooting style makes those scenes appear illuminated by strobe light. Even Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) the lone female driver on the crew throws blows - in a gown and heels - battling an all-woman security team led by MMA fighter Ronda Rousey. Though Letty is depicted as an equal among the boys there is a sexist undertone to the film. Attractive women are set dressing and Roman and Tej (Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges) play rock paper scissors for ""dibs"" on a woman. While that may be comic for some most of the funny comes from security agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) with lines like ""Daddys got to go to work"" after which he busts his arm out of a plaster cast Hulk-style just by flexing. It all adds up to an over-the-top escapist romp which is exactly what ""Fast amp; Furious"" fans expect. Share Read or Post Comments Were you interviewed for this story?

Photo Credit Universal Pictures advertisement | advertise on newsday From the moment that several candy-colored hot rods parachute from a plane and land wheels down on an Azerbaijan highway its clear that ""Furious 7"" is unconcerned with reality. The delicate politics of the region not to mention plain old physics are completely ignored. The latest installment in the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise is all about fun fantasy and teenage kicks and nothing will stop it. Not even the uncanny car-crash death of its star Paul Walker (whose brothers Caleb and Cody served as occasional stand-ins here). advertisement | advertise on newsday By now the ""Fast and Furious"" narrative has devolved into soap opera Han is dead Letty has amnesia and ex-con Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) is being hunted by black-ops renegade Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) whose brother was killed in the previous film. Its a slim excuse and a perfectly good one for trotting around the globe blowing up drones in Los Angeles and sending Lebanese sports cars crashing through Abu Dhabi skyscrapers. Fresh acting blood keeps energizing these movies and ""Furious 7"" gets a steroid-laced injection. Statham as the unstoppable Deckard hasnt been this brutal -- or this fun -- since his ""Transporter"" days. Kurt Russell a blast from the B-movie past plays Mr. Nobody a cocky covert type with a sharp suit and a smart mouth. Dwayne Johnson again sparkles as the rough-and-ready Agent Hobbs. They help distract from the weaker actors particularly Tyrese Gibson and Chris Bridges (aka rapper Ludacris) who havent improved much over the years. (The charismatic Diesel remains more a persona than a thespian; may he never change.) ""Furious 7"" might have treated women with more respect. The backsides of beach bunnies are highly visible but speaking roles for females are rare. Michelle Rodriguez is sidelined as Letty though she does get to wallop Mixed Martial Arts fighter Ronda Rousey (""The Expendables 3""). Nathalie Emmanuel joins the cast as Ramsey a hacker in a byte-size bikini. Jordana Brewster returns as Brians hearth-minding wife Mia. 259 MoviesFurious 7 trailer Though directed with wild abandon and gleeful destruction by James Wan ""Furious 7"" ends on an emotional note. In a highly symbolic and very nicely handled epilogue our heroes gather on a beach to bid farewell to Walker as Brian OConner. The character now has a wife a child and responsibilities -- which in this movies youthful world is its own kind of death. advertisement | advertise on newsday Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

You may also like me have a hard time remembering exactly what happened in each film. You neednt worry. The franchises Wikipedia page is filled with bare-bones yet surprisingly descriptive sentences like these ""Roman manages to anchor his car to the tank which Brian then pushes over a bridge flipping the tank."" Ah yes -- the old anchoring the car to the tank and then pushing it over the bridge trick from 2013s Fast amp; Furious 6. How quickly we forget Could anything in any subsequent Fast and Furious movie -- say Furious 7 -- ever top it? A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - The good news is that Furious 7 offers more -- and more and yet more -- of the same. The series prides itself on scaling grander heights of craziness each time and thats part of what fans love about it The 1001 instances of shock-absorber abuse in Furious 7 include but are not limited to pinwheel turns executed inside an Abu Dhabi skyscraper (by a car without brakes no less) and a rather sweet ode to one of the series great-grandpappies The Italian Job in which a long squarish buslike vehicle (which is not actually a bus) perches delicately on the brink of oblivion almost taking with it one of the series central characters the late Paul Walkers Brian OConner.Dizzying stuff happens in Furious 7 and there are probably more instances of airborne cars than in any other single movie in the series. (This is the only modern movie franchise that owes a serious debt to Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.) Theres something marvelously freeing about watching objects that were meant to hug the road soar through the heavens. Plus these brief moments of floating freedom are a respite from the films predictably A.D.D.-choppy editing a hallmark sadly of nearly all action movies today.Film DetailsCritics Pick Furious 7 RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time137 min. More Info Trailer Yet the pace of Furious 7 even for those who prefer their movies slow and calm is so aggressively frenetic that it might lull you into a sort of Zen state as it did me. A picture can move only so fast before it starts to drift backward and before long Furious 7s numerous swervings crashes and explosions started to blur into something like a spa bath. Like its forebears this movie -- directed by junior horror kingpin James Wan (The Conjuring) taking the gearshift from Justin Lin (director of movies three to six) -- has a characteristically throwaway plot with a few new faces thrown in. Jason Statham swaggers around as Deckard Shaw a nasty British special-ops guy out to avenge the death of his brother vanquished in the last movie. A Fast and Furious picture always needs an extra stone fox or two and flirty-flinty Nathalie Emmanuel plays one here. (Her character is a hot hacker.) A suave suit-wearing Kurt Russell pops in from nowhere -- his entrance is one of the movies grandest most pleasurable jokes -- to reassemble Brian OConners old gang for you know one last job.But this Furious 7 is more poignant than any other action movie in modern memory for the simple reason that this really will be Brians one last job. Walker was killed in a car crash in November 2013 during a break from filming Furious 7 and his presence in the finished film is palpable despite the fact that Wan had to use doubles (including Walkers two younger brothers) to complete the shoot. And no matter how zany and over-the-top the action details get the series core characters -- introduced in that first exhilarating surprise hit The Fast and the Furious made fourteen years ago -- have always been its lifeblood.Most of those characters -- the ones who havent been killed off at least -- are here One of the franchises more recent additions Dwayne Johnsons Agent Hobbs has a marvelous moment where he wields a gigantic automatic weapon -- with those meaty arms he handles it as daintily as if it were a leaf blower. Vin Diesels Dominic Toretto is back too of course In his trademark white waffle- knit shirt he looks like a hip Mr. Clean. Michelle Rodriguezs amnesiac Letty Ludacriss brainy-silly Tej and Tyrese Gibsons charming grandstander Roman remember things make wisecracks and try to run the show respectively.For all the full-throttle dazzle of Furious 7 the best scenes are the quietest ones in which these characters make observations about love life and family that would seem overcooked in any other movie. In a tense moment when Stathams villainous Shaw tries to foist that old ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend"" bromide on Toretto the latter responds with Dieselicious calmness ""I dont have friends. I have family."" Furious 7 is mostly as it should be Diesels show. His deep affection for his late co-star -- whom he calls both on- and off-screen his brother -- has always been there in his eyes and it seems to burn even warmer now.I confess Id always thought of Walker as a dull actor but I see now that he was simply one of those performers whose presence -- a handsome blond dependability -- changes and enhances the color of the movie around him. Thats no small thing. The ending of Furious 7 one of the most straightforward and yet most touching final shots Ive seen at the movies in years is a kind of benediction. ""Things are going to be different now"" Toretto say as Furious 7 coasts to a gentle stop. Because no matter how fast or how slow you drive the scenery around you is always subject to change.

(Fast amp; Furious) Paul Walker died during the filming of ""Furious 7"" but he remains a key part of the saga. (Universal Pictures) How can you hate a movie that jumps a car from one skyscraper to another? (Furious 7 trailer) BY Jacob Hall NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Tuesday March 31 2015 200 AM Title Furious 7 Film Info With Paul Walker Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez. Assassins gun for race car gang. Director James Wan (217) PG-13; Violence language. Area theaters. Opens Thurs. night. ""Furious 7"" is the biggest silliest movie in the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise officially transforming the series into ""The Avengers"" with muscle cars. But whats wrong with big and silly? Directed with over-the-top panache by horror maestro James Wan (""Saw"" ""Insidious"") the film is a live-action cartoon starring caricatures rather than characters. But hey these are charismatic personalities played by actors in on the joke. They maintain straight faces as they sell their macho dialogue and drive sports cars off the Burj Khalifa. Picking up shortly after the events of ""Fast and Furious 6"" (2013) the movie introduces a new big bald baddie. Jason Stathams Deckard Shaw is a ruthless assassin none too happy with the trouncing that Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his crew gave Shaws villainous little brother in ""6."" When Deckard brutally murders Han (Sung Kang) -- an event previously witnessed in the third film in this series lunatic timeline -- Dom gets the gang back together for one last ride. Tyrese Gibson Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges and Michelle Rodriguez all give solid support. But its the late Paul Walker who gets the most to do as the bromance between his Brian OConnor and Dom reaches a big-hearted conclusion. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker in Fast amp; Furious 7 (Universal Pictures) Despite his tragic death midway through production Walker remains a key player thanks to the clever use of body doubles and subtle CGI effects. His completed scenes radiate the relaxed everyman quality that made him such a fun screen presence. The film is a perfect sendoff for the late star concluding his journey with as much elegance as this series can muster. Dwayne Johnsons Hobbs spend most of his time on the sidelines this time but his spot is filled by veteran tough guy Kurt Russell. He brings his fair share of swagger and testosterone. 1 photos view gallery A look back at the life and career of Paul Walker ""Furious 7"" never even pretends to be a stand-alone movie. This is a fan event through and through filled with references inside jokes and a loyalty to continuity that may baffle newcomers. Its actually less a movie than a collection of scenes that feel constructed to make ""Furious"" fans cheer. And cheer they will because ""Furious 7"" features physics-defying action that looks like it belongs in a superhero movie. All of the preposterous action is balanced by the franchises trademark goofy honesty. When theyre not driving cars off airplanes the actors chat crack jokes and generally act like actual friends. When Diesel croaks something about the importance of family for the nth time its easy to drink the motor oil. With Walkers death ""Furious 7"" definitively ends a chapter in the ""Fast and Furious"" saga while opening the door to further adventures. But it sets the bar for craziness awfully high. The only way to top this one is to send Dom and the crew to outer space where no one can hear you rev your engine or talk about family. ON A MOBILE DEVICE? WATCH THE EXTENDED TRAILER HERE.

Photo 2015 Universal Studios MOVIE REVIEW Fast and Furious 7 Overheated Running time 129 min. Rated PG-13 (violence language). If the ""Fast and Furious"" crew could figure out how to power their souped-up autos with machismo theyd really have an innovation on their greasy hands. As it is the action in the seventh installment of the franchise is pretty by-the-book Car racing vengeance logic-defying stunts and stuff blowing up. Too much stuff blowing up really. We came for the cars and their reckless gorgeous drivers; we can get explosions anywhere. Theres also a bit of Tamp;A but its so beside the point The main objects to ogle here are the muscle cars and the muscles. Gold-hearted thug Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and lawman Brian OConner (Paul Walker) may each have formidable spouses (Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster respectively) but its their bromance thats front and center. The last two minutes of the film are a lovely ode to the late Walker who died in a fiery car crash in 2013 -- but in truth the whole film feels a bit that way (though perhaps it would not if you didnt know beforehand about his death; I suspect most viewers will). Every shot of Walkers character seems a little golden-burnished -- even the preposterous ones like where hes scrambling to get off a cliff-hanging Azerbaijani bus. (Walkers two brothers reportedly stood in for needed reshoots but thanks to todays level of technology youd really never know.) Its hard not to root for it on that score but despite James Wans capable direction and very game cast the whole thing goes increasingly wobbly like a bad axle until its just a tangle of metal and bullets and yelling. Part of the problem lies with the plot which like most action franchises insists on throwing in multiple bad guys when one good one would do. And whos better than Jason Statham? His well-groomed grenade-favoring Deckard Shaw -- ""a real English badass"" as one character puts it -- is on a mission to destroy Dominic amp; Co. for hospitalizing his brother. Meanwhile a mercenary named Jakande (Djimon Hounsou) is on a quest to nab a hacker (Nathalie Emmanuel) and the ultimate-surveillance device shes invented. And if thats not enough out of the ether comes -- 80s action guru Kurt Russell? Yes His ""Mr. Nobody"" as he calls himself offers Dominic a mysterious deal in which hell help him get Deckard if Dom and his crew save the hacker and her device. But the convoluted plot is just an excuse on which to hang logic-ridiculing set pieces and Wan doesnt skimp on that front. Dominic Brian and the team (Rodriguez Ludacris Tyrese Gibson) parachute cars out of an airplane at one point because why not? Dominic and Brian sail out of an Abu Dhabi skyscraper in a cherry-red Lykan HyperSport (quite an expensive ride I understand) and into another skyscraper. And out of that building and into another. Michelle Rodriguez and Vin Diesel in a scene from ""Furious 7.""Photo Universal Pictures Its wonderfully silly and there arent enough moments like it; too often the film devolves into eardrum-splitting mass mayhem (chases with helicopters and drones gunfights) when it should have the confidence to let its characters be the quasi-superheroes we know they are -- like when Statham and Diesel go at it in hand-to-hand combat or Dwayne Johnson leaps out of the hospital bed where he spends most of the film growling ""Daddys gotta go to work"" and flexing right out of his arm cast. Its these moments -- more than the goodbye montage even -- that are a real tribute to Walkers legacy in building this goofy good-natured car racing franchise.

And if incoming director James Wan (""The Conjuring"" ""Saw"") falls the tiniest bit short of what Justin Lin brought to the third fifth and sixth entries ""Furious 7"" nonetheless ranks a very successful fourth place overall with at least one gargantuan set piece that ranks among the series finest. See Video Furious 7 Features Touching Paul Walker Tribute (Video) As we learned in the closing credits of ""Fast and Furious 6"" Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) is out to get the gang of street-racers who put his brother Owen (Luke Evans) into intensive care. Having already taken out Han (Sung Kang) Shaw is gunning for Dom Brian the still-amnesiac Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) droll techie Tej (Ludacris) and flashy motormouth Roman (Tyrese Gibson). After Shaw sends FBI agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) to the hospital and blows up Doms house our heroes are out for revenge but to take on the black-ops-trained Shaw theyll need a little help from shadowy government agent Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) who approaches Dom with a proposition rescue a mysterious hacker -- and more importantly a device that can track anyone on earth via every closed-circuit camera and cellphone -- from terrorist Jakande (Djimon Hounsou) and Dom and his team can use the device to track down Shaw. MacGuffin plot in place the cast ventures forth to the Caucasus mountains and Abu Dhabi to track down their various foes before bringing everything back to downtown Los Angeles for a high-speed throwdown that involves not just souped-up cars but airborne assaults as well. Also Read Furious 7 Star Ludacris Says Paul Walker Jokes During Justin Bieber Roast Werent Appropriate (Video) ""Furious 7"" often feels like its attempting to hit the heights of its two predecessors so its hard not to make comparisons -- Rodriguez for example gets into a pretty intense brawl with Ronda Rousey (""The Expendables 3"") but its not quite up to the two fights she had against Gina Carano in ""Fast amp; Furious 6."" And while its exciting to see martial arts legend Tony Jaa join the cast (as one of Jakandes henchman) he doesnt get as much to do as Joe Taslim did in the previous film. While most of those parallels dont work in this new films favor ""Furious 7"" makes plenty of smart moves from giving the ever-stone-faced Diesel fewer speeches about the importance of family to mounting a giddily exciting centerpiece involving cars parachutes a well-armed bus and lots of sheer cliffs. (If anything the Caucasus sequence raises the bar so high that the rest of the movie cant compete.) Also Read Vin Diesel Says Furious 7 Oscar Chances Hindered by Academys Stigma Towards Action Films The death-defying nature of the stunts is of course underscored by the real-life passing of Walker and the film gives both the actor and his character a beautifully graceful farewell. (Bring a handkerchief.) Walkers familial scenes with on-screen wife Jordana Brewster take on an unforeseen poignancy and he brings the film a kind of energy that its easy to take for granted Brian is simply a good guy wanting to do right by his spouse and child and the actor makes that relatable and interesting even in these larger-than-life situations. Proving that the best villains have the charisma of a hero Statham makes a strong impression supplying the kind of menace that permeates the movie even when hes not on screen. His fight with Johnson doesnt have the bang youd expect from a The-Transporter-versus-The-Rock match-up but the climactic Statham-Diesel battle more than delivers. Rodriguez manages to be tough and tender even making us believe Letty when she talks about all the things she sees in Doms Mount Rushmore eyes and Gibson and Ludacris have their comic-opposites patter down to a science. These characters like the franchise itself dont go very deep but if you arent having a good time with all of this absurd machismo superheroic stunt driving and bro-bonding by now you probably never will.

But for all that the filmmakers cant quite get around the fact that over recent episodes Walkers boy-next-door ex-cop Brian had become something of a second-string player neither as memorably menacing as Vin Diesels Peperami-necked anti-hero Dom or as quick with the kiss-off one-liners as Dwayne Johnsons latecomer lawman Hobbs. And now hes got another smart-mouth beefcake to contend with Jason Statham chomping down great chunks of scenery as legitimate British badass Deckard Shaw on the trail of our heroes after they hospitalised his brother in the previous movie. The chase takes them to Tokyo the Dominican Republic Abu Dhabi Azerbaijan (really?) and finally back to their home turf on the mean streets of LA for a final showdown packed with helicopters drone strikes wrench fights and more glistening auto-porn than Jeremy Clarksons hard drive. If none of this is quite as blood-pumping as it ought to be that is largely down to director James Wans decision to shoot every automotive action sequence in such juddery relentless close-up that its often impossible to tell whats going on. The effect can be like having your face shoved into a fan belt and not necessarily in a good way. But the face-to-face punch-ups are a lot more fun - the Statham-Johnson smackdown resembles nothing more than two shaved pitbulls in a tumble dryer - and the sheer sense of ludicrous punch-the-air joie de vivre is impossibly infectious.

A new director at the helm and the sudden death of leading man Paul Walker might have spelled doom for the ""Fast and the Furious"" franchise but rather like one of its own seemingly indestructible muscle cars ""Furious 7"" has emerged miraculously unscathed. In taking over for longtime director Justin Lin (parts three to six) horror auteur James Wan (""The Conjuring"") ably steps up to the big-action plate orchestrating two-plus-hours of increasingly outlandish vehicular (and aerobatic) mayhem that revs pulses and engines in roughly equal measure. Completed under what were surely challenging circumstances but (mostly) seamless to behold ""Furious 7"" provides both a satisfying chapter in the movies pre-eminent gearhead soap opera and a tactful touching memorial to Walker whose final screen appearance will help ensure that this already 2.3 billion series is seven times lucky at the worldwide box office. When Walker died in a high-speed car crash in November 2013 he was only halfway through filming ""Furious 7"" -- a process that was eventually completed using a combination of unseen Walker footage from previous films and new scenes shot using stand-ins (including Walkers two younger brothers Caleb and Cody) who then had the late actors face digitally grafted onto their bodies. Reportedly this sent the films already enormous 200 million budget spiraling toward 250 million but to judge from the end product -- and its enthusiastic reception here at SXSW -- it was time and money very well spent. Although there are moments -- especially during a climactic foot-and-car chase on the streets of downtown Los Angeles -- where Walker (or his avatar) is conspicuously filmed from behind or with his face obscured for most of the time Walker is onscreen (which is quite often) its nigh impossible to tell whether he is fully real or partly virtual. We are not so far here from the once-absurd suggestion that it might some day be possible to make a brand new-movie ""starring"" Humphrey Bogart or Marilyn Monroe. But for now there is Walker and it is a constant pleasure to watch the excitingly physical actor he was once again hurl himself into the movies complicated stunt sequences like a human cannonball. Although Walker could never have known this would be his final performance it may be the ultimate compliment to say that he plays each moment as though it were his last. And when the time does come for his Brian OConner to bid adieu the movie arranges it in a way that feels fully earned and well within the boundaries of good taste. Up until then its more or less business as usual in ""Furious"" land with one badly banged-and-bruised bad guy from 2013s ""Furious 6"" (Luke Evans Owen Shaw) still clinging to life by a thread; a badder baddie (Jason Statham as Shaws older brother Deckard) waiting in the wings; and for good measure a terrorist mastermind (Djimon Hounsou) intent on -- what else? -- world domination. Owner of a scowl that could re-thaw the polar ice caps and one of the few actors who could plausibly take the Rock and/or Vin Diesel in a fight Statham gets a great entrance putting baby bro out of his misery (along with an entire heavily guarded London hospital) without breaking a sweat. But its revenge that looms largest on Deckards mind. First up (as teased at the end of ""Furious 6"") a trip to Tokyo where Deckard helps the vacationing Han (Sung Kang) to meet his maker -- events that finally close the chronological gap between the third ""Fast"" film 2006s ""Tokyo Drift"" and parts four to six (which effectively functioned as one long flashback). Then its off to L.A. where Deckard makes it clear that its open season on Dominic Toretto (Diesel) and his entire crew. (The screenplay is once again by Chris Morgan whos written the last four films in the series.) If Hans death (in a burning car no less) casts a somewhat eerie pall over ""Furious 7"" its not the only thing that does. Walker/OConner is first seen revving the engine of a most atypical vehicle -- a Chrysler minivan -- with his infant son strapped into a car seat in the back and one of the new films running themes is that while marriage and fatherhood may have domesticated Brian he still pines for his old rebel-outlaw days. ""He says he misses the bullets"" notes wife Mia (Jordanna Brewster) as if it were a perfectly normal sentiment. But how much longer can -- or should -- Brian continue to put himself in harms way when he has a young family waiting for him at home? The arrival of Deckard momentarily makes that a moot point as everyone -- even still-amnesiac Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) -- readies for battle . Then comes another new cast member a silver-tongued government shadow man (Kurt Russell) who refers to himself as ""Mr. Nobody"" and tells Dom he can help him eliminate Shaw provided Dom does something for him first. G-man Russell needs help with the rescue of a kidnapped computer hacker Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) whos being held by Hounsous Mose Jakande somewhere in the Caucasus. (Unspecified ""political"" concerns prevent the U.S. from staging an official rescue mission.) Ramsey has developed a software program unsubtly named ""Gods Eye"" that can track anyones movements at any point on the globe through any available camera or cell phone. In the wrong hands it could be a disaster. Think Edward Snowdens worst nightmare times infinity. Things manage to get even more complicated -- perhaps a bit too much -- from there in a story that hopscotches to Azerbaijan and Abu Dhabi before finally ending up back in L.A. But then the special appeal of the ""Fast"" movies has never lain in the what they do and when but rather how they do it -- as in how do you manage to deposit a half-dozen high-test super cars on a remote stretch of winding Azerbaijani mountainside without raising too many eyebrows? Why parachute them out of a cargo plane of course ... with the drivers already buckled in Note that this is not the last time a car will glide balletically through the air in ""Furious 7."" Nor is it even the second-to-last time. Wan and veteran ""Furious"" stunt coordinator/second unit director Spiro Razatos also stage a jaw-dropping literal cliffhanger involving an overturned bus sliding toward certain doom and later a ridiculous but highly entertaining car chase that begins inside one of Abu Dhabis skyscraping Etihad towers and ends in a neighboring one without ever touching the ground.  Not all of the action quite lives up to those high standards and none of it can quite surpass the sublime ""Fast Five"" finale in which two Dodge Chargers towed a massive bank vault through the streets of Rio de Janeiro. Wan a master of old-school analog frights in his horror movies favors a more frenetic shooting and editing style here and gooses his setpieces with too much CGI. (The movie is also at 137 minutes arguably too much of a good thing.) Still ""Furious 7"" has few equals in the category of sevens and outside of the James Bond franchise (which was up to ""Diamonds Are Forever"" at a comparable point in its lifespan) its hard to think of another contemporary film series that has run this long while continuing to afford so much pleasure. Harder still to think of another mainstream Hollywood blockbuster past or present with this level of ethnic and socioeconomic diversity on display just because thats who the characters are and not because the filmmakers are trying to earn PC brownie points. ""It wont be the same going forward"" one character says late in the film and thats certainly true. But to judge from the evidence here even a Walker-less team ""Furious"" still has plenty of gas left in the tank. Also joining the cast for this latest outing Thai martial-arts superstar Tony Jaa female UFC champ Ronda Rousey and in a blink-and-you-miss-her cameo Iggy Azalea. The films full onscreen title reads ""Furious Seven"" although all posters and marketing materials bear the numeral ""7."" The presence of two credited cinematographers and four credited editors offers further evidence that the interrupted production took many hands on deck to properly salvage.

Every comment is welcome. )))) Reply Ayush Chandra says June 14 2015 at 836 am Nice Review. We all were expecting from Furious 7 that it will be Something WOW but unfortunately it is not of that Level. Screenplay stunts and Direction is good but it lacks in the actual Story. It became a HIGH Budget Fail. Film attracts such huge audience towards the theaters just because of Late Paul Walker. Overall it is a One or Two time watch but not as expected Its 6th and some earlier Parts are much capable of involving audience in it. Reply Leigh of FakeABaby says March 17 2015 at 1232 pm Sooo looking forward to see Pauls last film. missinmycrushie Reply Jo says March 17 2015 at 1008 am Nice (partial) read but too detailed and lengthy considering the movie hasnt come out...using Walkers brothers for stand ins amp; digitizing his face on their body TMI Reply rjbailey says March 17 2015 at 445 am Reblogged this on Locating Frankensteins Brain. Reply Fernby says March 16 2015 at 1105 pm Man this is great news. I was so worried after Walkers passing that this film would feel somehow disjointed but to hear its a mostly seamless farewell to the franchises lynchpin Im relieved beyond measure. I would dispute the phrase ""too much of a good thing"" though because with these films theres no such thing as too much. ;) Reply Terry Martin says March 16 2015 at 1010 pm Im a Fan of all Fast Furious Movies Also Fan Big Fan of all the Actors in all the Movies too BUT Im Heart Broken over lossing Paul Walker too I always will be too So to say Im very glad ""Furious 7"" was able to be finish too say it would be nice if Paul Walker Was able to be part of the ending  BUT I believe He was there with all of Yall ALWAYS FOREVER Too Thank You for the chance to say Im glad there are People like Yall in this World too Much Love Yall Terry Martin Reply Jim says March 16 2015 at 631 pm How long is Lucas Black in the movie? Reply briandanacamp says March 17 2015 at 834 am I was curious about the same thing but theres no mention of Black in the entire review. Thats an odd omission. Reply mightymad says April 3 2015 at 133 pm 5 minutes is actually pretty generous. Lets just say way longer than Azalea but still not close enough to break the one minute mark - he only had like three-four new lines here for chrissake. Patrick Juvet says March 20 2015 at 703 am About 5 minutes at most roxriotour says March 16 2015 at 543 pm Reblogged this on Roxies HeaLinG Korner.....

Daily Edition Login to download Furious 7 Film Review 206 AM PDT 3/16/2015 by John DeFore FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS A nuance-free franchise crafts an honorable exit for its departed star TWITTER Walker Diesel and their cohorts blow the doors off on one last adventure together. Any moviegoer who didnt know about the untimely death of Paul Walker would never guess it had occurred during production of Furious 7 a film that (whatever massive efforts were required to work around his absence) is as stupendously stupid and stupidly diverting as it could have hoped to be had everything gone as planned. The knowledge of his death in a November 2013 car accident colors our experience of this unintentional swan song in many ways of course but viewers trying to spot the scenes in which stand-ins and CGI played Walkers part for him will find it hard enough that they may do the right thing Stop trying and instead go along with a reworked screenplay that ushers him off the stage with as much grace as any other development in this muscle-car melodrama. Technical miracles aside the nature of the story makes watching Furious 7 something of a morbid game Over and over the action puts Walkers Brian OConner in such jeopardy that we think ""Ah this will be the scene where they give him a heroic death."" But saying ""over and over"" acknowledges that Brian survives at least the bomb blast that nearly kills his family in one fell swoop that he manages to get out of that big bus hanging precariously over a cliff and that he and for that matter all his pals drive their cars out of a plane in midair and parachute to the ground without so much as denting a fender. But producer Neal H. Moritz who introduced the super-last-minute screening at South by Southwest begged the audience to keep mum about Brians fate so we wont provide an exhaustive list of the many certain-death situations he faces and survives. We neednt say much about the plot either. Bare bones Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) brother of the crews defeated enemy Owen Shaw has vowed to kill them all in revenge; an all-seeing surveillance program called Gods Eye has been stolen by terrorists; the creator of said program (Nathalie Emmanuels Ramsey) needs to be rescued; and a mysterious lawman with his own private army (Kurt Russell who any oddsmaker would say is bound to be hiding something) promises to help Vin Diesels Dom get Deckard if Doms crew will save Ramsey and recover the Gods Eye. Tired yet? You will be after two hours of F7 which is as overinflated if not as well formed as the physique of Dwayne Johnson who gave this ensemble a much-needed charisma boost when he signed on in episode five. Alas Johnson is sidelined for much of this installment laid up in a bodycast after saving a co-worker from an exploding building. Dont worry kids the Rock will be back for the climax reentering the action with the words ""Daddys gotta go to work."" That is Wildean wit compared to most of Chris Morgans unrepentantly dumb pulp dialogue. But Fast amp; Furious fans dont come out to critique lines like ""Lets do this"" they come to see a red sports car (one so expensive only seven were made) be stolen from a billionaires Abu Dhabi penthouse; to watch it bust through his windows fly through the air and crash into the skyscraper next door (landing safely of course) only to learn that the brakes have gone out and it will have to take to the skies again into a third building. Anyone who can buy that bit of computer-generated idiocy should have no trouble believing Paul Walker is in this film from start to finish.
