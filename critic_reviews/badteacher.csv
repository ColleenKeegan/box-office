By Anthony Lane Justin Timberlake and Cameron Diaz in a movie directed by Jake Kasdan.   Credit Illustration by TOM BACHTELL Waiting for ""Bad Teacher"" to begin I caught a trailer for the upcoming ""Horrible Bosses."" What is it with these titles? Studios may think that they can palm us off with flat sour recitations of what their products contain but back in 1975 no one would have paid to see a Spielberg film called ""Nasty Fish."" In the words of Raymond Chandler whose ear for a good title was the sharpest of the twentieth century the names of books and films should conjure ""a particular magic which impresses itself on the memory."" ""The Maltese Falcon"" as he said ""makes the mind ask questions."" No danger of that here. The woman at the hub of ""Bad Teacher""--to call her the heroine would be a stretch--is Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz) who is certainly bad at teaching and no better at ordinary life. Shortly to be married she quits John Adams Middle School in Illinois goes home gets dumped by her fiance and returns to John Adams at the start of the following term. If she didnt like the place before she loathes it now fobbing her pupils off with DVDs instead of giving them lessons. This hardly endears her to colleagues such as Mr. Snur (John Michael Higgins) the dolphin-friendly principal or the chattering Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch). Yes she really is named Squirrel; why reach for the subtle the movie implies when the crunchingly obvious lies close to hand? There are few genres that I dread more than the teaching movie. This is because more often than not the mechanics of actual teaching are sidelined in favor of a public lecture on Ways to Inspire. I still recall the wrath with which I simmered through ""Dead Poets Society"" ""Dangerous Minds"" and--heaven preserve us--""Mr. Hollands Opus"" all of which left me with a renewed respect for Mr. Gradgrind the stony tyrant of the schoolroom in Dickenss ""Hard Times"" described as ""a kind of cannon loaded to the muzzle with facts."" The heart sinks in inverse proportion to the eagerness with which such movies command it to soar and there is a wild relief to be had in seizing upon the exceptions like ""Rushmore"" and ""Election"" which politely inform Mr. Holland where he can stick his opus. Would it be too much to hope that ""Bad Teacher"" might follow in their cool and perspicacious groove? Yes it would. The life of the school it transpires is little more than a convenient window in which the director Jake Kasdan and his screenwriters Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg get to hang a threadbare tale of romantic rivalry. ""My full-time job is to find a guy whos going to take care of me"" Elizabeth declares before lending weight to this bracingly feminist cause by saving up for a pair of bigger breasts. In a scene lifted from ""Cool Hand Luke"" she also washes cars in a pair of mini-shorts under the eyes of salivating males yet she fails to win the love of the new teacher Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake) who prefers Miss Squirrel. Scott though dim and dorky hails from an excitingly wealthy background. Yeah right. If you can see past the dismal sexual politics of ""Bad Teacher"" which I couldnt you might applaud the gall of a film that expends so little effort in forcing us to like its central character. The trouble with Elizabeth Halsey however and the reason that Scott is right to stay clear is not that shes lazy conniving superficial and doped up. The trouble is that shes a drag who slows down rather than quickens the movie and Cameron Diaz playing gamely against type gets outpaced by the supporting cast especially by Jason Segel as a gym teacher and Lucy Punch with her prim exclamations of surprise--""Shut the front door"" she cries skirting a different F-word. In a line that will freeze the soul of Arne Duncan Elizabeth is asked ""What went so wrong that you ended up educating children?"" But thats the wrong question. The correct one is What have you done children to deserve Miss Halsey? The educator who matters in ""Terri"" is Mr. Fitzgerald (John C. Reilly) an assistant principal with a problem. His problem is Terri Thompson (Jacob Wysocki) a mountain in his mid-teens with a penchant for wearing pajamas to school. Add the soft unhurried waddle of the lads gait plus the seconds that tick by as he ponders the answer to a simple inquiry and you start to wonder if Terri is less of a student than a sleepwalker. It is Mr. Fitzgeralds chosen task to awaken Terri to the world along with other worrisome cases--Chad (Bridger Zadina) say who claws at his scalp as if trying to get at the itchy thoughts inside. Azazel Jacobss film runs a grave risk of falling into the Fitzgerald habit the urge not uncommon in kindly teachers to concentrate so hard on the constant flow of misfits in your care that you all but neglect the fits--the boys and girls who manage more or less to make it through the week. Now and then we dip into classrooms but only in order to deal with folks like Heather (Olivia Crocicchia) the class beauty for whom Terri does a good turn. Far more time however is spent outside Mr. Fitzgeralds office where Terri and Chad sit listening to the coughs of a ghost-white secretary and waiting to be listened to themselves. This is infinitely preferable to the shabby cynicism of ""Bad Teacher"" which congratulates itself on brushing off kids like flies. Nonetheless I couldnt help thinking of ""To Be and to Have"" the great French documentary of 2002 which summoned the patience to lock into the regular--and it turned out fascinating--rhythms of give-and-take that existed between one man and his class. Maybe feature films avid for incident and payoff and nervous of anything that smacks of a daily grind are barred from finding that beat. Yet ""Terri"" works not least because against expectation it is a beautiful movie to look at with an enchanted sense of place. The parentless Terri lives in a house in the woods with an ailing uncle an ancient TV and sedimentary layers of books. The whole setup has the secret air of a fairy tale what with Terris dappled path to school and patches of chiaroscuro--normally the prerogative of thrillers and horror flicks but used here to suck people into pools of solitude. These are never darker than when Terri Chad and Heather on a rare nocturnal binge flirt with catastrophe. Thankfully they pull back and the next morning breaks fresh and free. Terri finds Mr. Fitzgerald something of an overgrown kid himself asleep in his car. They hang out for a while not as master and pupil but as friends; and their time together in all its bleary brightness feels like a state of grace. If you think that Elizabeth Halsey is self-centered wait till you meet Baya Benmahmoud (Sara Forestier). She is the force that powers ""The Names of Love"" an unstoppable flywheel of lust good intentions poor judgment world-class ditziness and sentimental blah. Here is a young woman half French half Algerian who buys crustaceans not in order to boil them and eat them with melted butter but to return them alive and snapping to the sea. She cant hold down a job for five minutes but what she excels at as an upstanding left-winger is making love to right-wing men--and doing it with such elan that they are converted to her views. Now thats sexual politics. This new French comedy directed by Michel Leclerc has flashes of sappiness yet it puts ""Bad Teacher"" to shame not just by humming with high spirits but by allowing us to admit now and then that what its heroine truly needs is not to be worshipped or taken to bed yet again but rapped on the knuckles and sent to the back of the class. So allergic to multitasking is Baya that she comes out of the shower answers the phone leaves her apartment and gets as far as a Metro car before realizing that she has forgotten to get dressed. To be fair she is wearing boots but nothing else which is mildly perplexing to the Muslim couple sitting opposite--a typical instance of Leclercs desire to land as many jabs as he can on areas of cultural tenderness. Not that Jewish sensibilities escape provocation Baya is thrilled at the news that her latest paramour the hyper-square Arthur (Jacques Gamblin) has Jewish blood. ""We have loads of deaths in our families because of French cops"" she says with widened eyes. The weirdest hiccup in the movie arrives when the name ""Bernard-Henri Levy"" is translated in the subtitles as ""Woody Allen."" Do I hear the distant rumble of a lawsuit? Probably not if only because Leclerc pays such lavish homage in the construction of his film to golden-age Allen; the moments at which a bewildered Arthur consults his teen-age self could have come straight out of ""Annie Hall."" In fact I began to wonder whether an American remake might for once be in order. A Prius-driving environmentalist from Seattle sets out to screw a host of Tea Party stalwarts into Hegelian consciousness? Or just for the heck of it vice versa? Any takers?

"Bad Teacher Movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Jake KasdanMovie review Bad TeacherThere are too many Fs and incompletes to give this Cameron Diaz comedy an A.June 24 2011|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Cameron Diaz left and Justin Timberlake in ""Bad Teacher."" (Gemma LaMana / Sony / Columbia...)""Bad Teacher"" is a classic underachiever. This subversive comedy definitely has its moments but when the final grades are in the raunchy romantic romp starring Cameron Diaz Jason Segel Justin Timberlake and Lucy Punch is a frustrating mix of smart flash and smirking impudence. It makes you want to dash off a ""could have been great if only theyd tried harder"" note to the parents. The notion that director Jake Kasdan and screenwriters Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg (""The Office"" veterans) play with is a clever twist on the age-old question What really makes a good girl good and a bad girl bad? I say ""girl"" because even though Diazs Elizabeth Halsey and Punchs Amy Squirrel are board-certified teachers they are a long way from adults. Ironically Segels pot-smoking gym teacher is the grown-up among ""Bad Teachers"" class clowns and quite an appealing one at that. Meanwhile Timberlake is an embarrassingly infantile sub Mr. Delacorte though he can sing (but we knew that). Now to the ""good-bad"" question which the filmmakers have restated thusly Can we look past Elizabeths filthy mouth very hot bod fabulous hair sexy clothes and clear disdain for virtually all of humanity to see the possibly decent person that might be buried deep deep deep inside? They dont make a ""yes"" easy. The movie starts as Elizabeth is wrapping up what she thinks will be her first and last year at the local middle school where shes been putting the finishing touches on her wedding of convenience a her intended is conveniently rich. A bad turn of events puts her back in the classroom in the fall and convinces her that all she needs is a boob job to turn things around. Raising enough money for the procedure becomes an obsession and she will do anything to get there. The various ""anythings"" become the comic fodder that drives the action with cinematographer Alar Kivilo (""The Blind Side"") ensuring that the apple stays polished. Elizabeths nemesis is Amy a perky redhead whos got a killer grip on the top teacher spot a crush on goody two-shoes Mr. Delacorte and an increasingly loose screw. Driving her crazy is Elizabeths ability to convince everyone else that despite her many offenses a showing movies to her class while she sleeps off a hangover is a frequent one a shes good at her job or as Principal Wally Snur (John Michael Higgins) puts it shes teaching ""for the right reasons"" (which sadly only makes me think of ""The Bachelor"" and ""The Bachelorette""). Diaz is quite fearless in playing funny willing to throw those long gams and all that sex appeal under the bus if it will get the laugh. Its been more successful when shes playing the innocent as she did with a great deal of campy charm in ""Theres Something About Mary"" and ""My Best Friends Wedding."" She should be able to go dark too but most filmmakers including Kasdan dont seem to know exactly how to take her there. So instead of physical comedy (soaping up in Daisy Dukes at the schools fundraising car wash does not count) ""Bad Teacher"" puts all its comic chips on giving her a potty mouth. I guess in the current comedy culture where F-bombs are king its good that Hollywood is finally allowing women to be just as foul as the guys though I dont think thats what the feminist movement had in mind with the whole gender-equality fight. That the filmmakers find the idea of a woman saying something really blue to be both shocking and fall-down hilarious tells you just how far we have to go. Though perhaps not a lofty goal hard-R comic equality is possible in the best sense. Case in point ""Bridesmaids"" served up its women raw but if you watch it closely the raunch has organic roots planted in situations. ""Bad Teacher"" on the other hand uses more of the strafing approach a having Elizabeth throw bad words around like Molotov cocktails whenever things get slow. That approach helps make ""Bad Teacher"" feel more like a string of comic vignettes than an actual story unfolding more heavily influenced in style than it should be by the writers sitcom background. A few of those short bits though are priceless especially the interludes that pair Diaz and Phyllis Smith playing a dandy version of the self-deprecating soul that has made her such a valuable member of ""The Office"" ensemble. As a comedy director Kasdan has good instincts that arent quite fully realized here. The scenes that are the most satisfying a Diaz and Segels romantic smackdowns chief among them a are the ones that are more character-driven echoing the fine work he did on TVs ""Freaks and Geeks"" and ""Undeclared."" Unfortunately there arent enough of them to keep you from wishing that school would let out early. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESReview Bad Teacher pleasantly softens as a CBS sitcomApril 24 2014Lucy Punch turning her back on fame?July 4 2011Cameron Diaz feels good about BadJune 19 2011MORE STORIES ABOUTJake KasdanBad TeacherCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword",http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jun/24/entertainment/la-et-bad-teacher-20110624,200,badteacher1,badteacher,latimes

I give it an A. I dont understand why it didnt get great reviews. Maybe the terminally politically correct types didnt like it b/c it made fun of teachers. Get over it; the movie and Cameron Diaz were great. Tedsaid on Saturday January 21 2012 23817 PMYikes This movie was horrible. Bad Santa had some funny moments. This garbage was not funny. Ericsaid on Tuesday October 25 2011 40912 PMThis film was brilliant Unfortunately most people just dont get it. Great comedy. Justin Timberlake kind of sucked though. beegeessaid on Friday September 23 2011 52121 AMYes I totally agree with your review. This film is politically incorrect it lacks sense of humor no message that leaves in our heart. The movies should even its a comedy have some message. I never laughed it was just disguasting nasty film that Ive ever seen. Jamessaid on Thursday July 21 2011 62613 PMAs a long time follower of Richards reviews I cant agree with this one. It absolutely does not deserve a better rating that Horrible Bosses which while it was not gem had far more laugh out loud moments than this feeble and forced excuse for a comedy.

Bad Teacher reviewed Cameron Diaz Justin Timberlake and Jason Segel are half-funny. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 24 2011 229 PM Middle Schooled Cameron Diaz and Justin Timberlake in Bad Teacher. By Dana Stevens Cameron Diaz Justin Timberlake and Jason Segel in Bad Teacher A black comedy a la Bad Santa --the kind of movie that hides its warm and squishy center inside a hardened shell of cynicism and makes them both taste pretty good--is tough to pull off. To work on both levels such a film must have an appreciation both for unapologetic bad behavior and for the transformative power of human relationships. We must laugh in identificatory glee at the selfishness of the leading man or woman and also care enough to believe that he or she deserves something more from life. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Bad Teacher (Columbia Pictures) directed by Jake Kasdan (whose last movie was the spotty but intermittently hilarious Walk Hard The Dewey Cox Story) gets only the first part right. As Elizabeth Halsey a promiscuous gold-digging middle-school teacher Cameron Diaz is enjoyably horrid. But we never detect the human being behind her exterior of awfulness or witness a moment of vulnerability introspection or regret. Elizabeth isnt like Billy Bob Thorntons dissolute department-store Santa a damaged but worthy person who reflexively holds the world at arms length. Shes just a pretty blonde jerk. Advertisement What kind of jerk? Elizabeth skips all faculty meetings and sloughs off her responsibilities on her fellow teachers especially the enragingly perky Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch). She smokes pot in her car in the school parking lot. She sneaks sips from a flask behind her desk while showing her students in-class movies for weeks at time. Elizabeths attempt to quit teaching and marry rich is thwarted when her fiance realizing she cares nothing about him dumps her; humiliated she returns to John Adams Middle School to beg for her job. Elizabeth has an eye on the new substitute teacher Scott (Justin Timberlake) who comes from money and is volunteering out of the goodness of his heart. She brushes off the advances of the schlubby sarcastic gym teacher Russell (who by mere dint of the fact that hes played by Jason Segel we know to be a decent guy). But Scott takes up with Elizabeths arch-nemesis the goody-goody Amy which only redoubles Elizabeths determination to land him for herself. Whats more Elizabeth has long been obsessed with getting a breast job to make her already-slammin body even more pneumatic and shes willing to embark on all manner of embezzlement schemes to afford it. With Amy acting as informant to the principal (John Michael Higgins) the school administration slowly starts to crack down on Elizabeths malfeasance but not before shes gotten herself into some serious--and possibly legal--trouble. From time to time Bad Teacher gestures vaguely at the movie it could have been. Diaz slouches and snarls effectively through the early scenes. It isnt till we realize her redemption will be unsatisfying that the character starts to curdle. The role of Scott a sexless bow-tie-wearing nudnik cannily exploits Justin Timberlakes inherent creepiness; a scene where he serenades his new girlfriend at a bar even allows him to sing (though the song which Timberlake co-wrote needed lyrics that were 20 percent funnier and sharper). Jason Segel who deserves a role infinitely better than this one gets in a few laugh lines in as the laconic P.E. coach. Bad Teacher has one massive blind spot For a movie purportedly about teaching it seems curiously uninterested in children focusing almost entirely on the sniping among the middle-school faculty. What do the kids in her class think of Miss Halsey? The students we see embody crudely drawn types the smart preppie girl in pearls the dunce whose mouth is constantly hanging open--but with the exception of one nerdy unpopular kid (Matthew J. Evans) theyre barely given names much less characters. Toward the end of the movie Elizabeth helps the unpopular kid get through an embarrassing moment on a school field trip. But we dont sense any real connection or reciprocity between student and teacher The boy exists purely to provide the Diaz character the redemption required by the plot. I dont like to begrudge fictional characters their happiness but whatever good fortune befalls Elizabeth at the end of this movie felt deeply unearned. If youre looking for a funny comedy about a cynical hard-partying school teacher transformed by his students into a paragon of pedagogical awesomeness skip Bad Teacher and go rent School of Rock instead.

But heres the secret to the earlier films We like Walter Matthau and Billy Bob Thornton from the beginning long before these foul creatures reluctantly seize the opportunity to redeem themselves. The reason? Theyre underdogs pitiable sad sacks who have fallen all the way down the social ladder banging their chin on every rung. As Elizabeth Halsey the cheerfully vile seventh-grade instructor in Bad Teacher Cameron Diaz proves a much tougher sell. When the film opens Elizabeth is not an underdog but a bully. Theres a whiff of entitlement behind her open contempt for her colleagues and students even before shes shown blazing through the parking lot at John Adams Middle School (called ""JAMS"" by its more enthusiastic educators) in a brand-new Mercedes. And though shes quickly humbled when her rich fiance gets wise to her gold-digging motives her mirthless ambition to marry into wealth doesnt change. All that changes is the vehicle she hopes will get her there a 10000 pair of fake boobs. The bulk of Bad Teacher is about Elizabeths attempts to raise the money for these monuments to her shallow status-seeking ambitions which is a good indicator of the films aggressively juvenile sensibility. Given its most obvious predecessors -- the aforementioned Bad movies plus the much more family-friendly School Of Rock -- its brand of slacker irreverence seems a little stale at times particularly when it confuses shock value for comic value. The laughs that do score in this bumpy comedy tend to be sidewinders. Since Theres Something About Mary Diaz has always looked happiest when shes goofing around but she throws herself into this role with a zeal thats a notch too amplified. Still shes surrounded by a wealth of talent including a terrific Justin Timberlake as a clean-living (and rich) substitute with a thing for cable-knit sweaters Jason Segel as a laid-back gym teacher who functions as an audience surrogate and The Offices Phyllis Smith as Elizabeths amusingly passive lackey. Add to that bit turns by ringers like Dave ""Gruber"" Allen whom Freak amp; Geeks cultists will appreciate for more or less reprising his role as a hippie-burnout teacher; Tom Lennon as the easily duped keeper of standardized test answers; and John Michael Higgins as the dolphin fetishist who serves as JAMSs principal and there are plenty of quality gags seeping through from the margins. i Diaz Jason Segel and Justin Timberlake jeopardize childrens futures one off-color joke at a time. Most of the films laughs come from its gifted comedic ensemble. Sony Pictures hide caption toggle caption Sony Pictures Diaz Jason Segel and Justin Timberlake jeopardize childrens futures one off-color joke at a time. Most of the films laughs come from its gifted comedic ensemble. Sony Pictures More problematic is Lucy Punch as the descriptively named Amy Squirrel who serves as Elizabeths romantic rival and bete noire at JAMS a chipper ""across-the-hall mate"" who rallies her students to excellence while a hungover Elizabeth pops school-related movies like Stand amp; Deliver into the DVD player. Amy is made to seem equally detestable if not more so because she hides her maliciousness under a goody-two-shoes act. But the film isnt nearly so eager to find anything human or redeemable about Amy and the cartoonish rivalry between her and Elizabeth leaves a sour aftertaste. Nevertheless funny forgives a lot and director Jake Kasdan (Walk Hard The Zero Effect) working from a script by longtime Office writing partners Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg gets contributions up and down the ensemble. The little touches pay off the most like Segels throwaway improv in a dodgeball sequence Timberlakes perpetual look of dim impressionability or the succession of ever-more-ludicrous movies Elizabeth shows the class in lieu of teaching. The overall impression is of a great assembly of offbeat talent stranded in a film with a directive to offend but little desire to stick to the lesson plan.

By Peter Rainer Film critic June 24 2011 Save for later Saved Jason Segel (l.) and Cameron Diaz are shown in a scene from Bad Teacher. Gemma LaMana/Columbia Pictures - Sony/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The game plan of ""Bad Teacher"" is quite simple - create a middle school variant on ""Bad Santa."" I happen to like ""Bad Santa."" When it came out I was more than amused by the angry ruckus from people who apparently like little Virginia think Santa Claus is real.Jake Kasdans ""Bad Teacher"" written by Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg has its lewd funniness though not often enough to make it worthy of not only ""Bad Santa"" but more to the point ""School of Rock.""Cameron Diazs Elizabeth Halsey is a middle school English teacher - at least I think she teaches English - who is on the prowl for a rich guy after her wealthy fiance dumps her for running up a whopping tab on his credit card. Her immediate goal pulling together the many thousands shell need for a first-class breast implant job. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? A rich but dweeby new teacher played by Justin Timberlake ends up being snared by a ding-a-ling/dweeby social studies teacher played with pinpoint goofiness by Lucy Punch. That leaves gym teacher Russell Gettis (Jason Segel) who doesnt let his slim bank account slow down his advances to the unadmiring Elizabeth. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? These two seem made for each other - hes hip to all her scams and enjoys watching them disintegrate - but her conversion from gold-digging shrew to (sort of) good girl is way too rapid. On the other hand this 92-plus-minute movie seems overlong. Grade B- (Rated R for sexual content nudity language and some drug use.)

Cameron Diaz and Justin Timberlake star in Bad Teacher. Photo Columbia Pictures Bad Teachers 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Protagonists are always more intriguing when they sport a few flaws even lots of flaws even when theyre evil-incarnate serial killers. But a decent antihero still needs one thing charm. It offsets the repulsion and goes well with a nice chianti tht-tht-tht-tht. Cameron Diazs character displays none of it in Bad Teacher. No charm anywhere. Nada. One-Nay. Elizabeth Halsey is a dreadful woman lazy superficial casually racist. A seventh-grade English instructor at an Illinois middle school she forces her pupils to watch movies each day (Stand and Deliver natch) while drinking herself into a stupor. When parents voice their concerns at an open house she dismisses them in a snit and then collects bribes. A kid gives her homemade cookies. She spits them out. Another kid confesses his crush on a classmate. She mocks him. Inspired if thats the word to make her students perform well on a state test she propels a rubber gym ball at their terrified faces and unprotected groins. (Child abuse. Ha. Ha.) Determined to raise 10000 for a new pair of mighty breasts -- which would shes convinced snare the wealthy new substitute played by Justin Timberlake - she resorts to criminal means. Apart from her ability to writhe orgasmically in short-shorts while soaping up a car she has no redeeming talents whatsoever. Diaz fails to invest this woman with anything resembling a soft side anything to make her less overtly horrible but I cant imagine anyone else succeeding. (Judi Dench?) The protagonist is fatally flawed. Because she hogs 90 percent of the action the film is too. Director Jake Kasdan is fully capable of making a funny movie when supported by a functioning screenplay ( Walk Hard The Dewey Cox Story). Here he is not. Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg shared screenwriting credits with Harold Ramis on the biblical comedy Year One and theyve progressed or something from sodomy jokes to Bad Santa-style misbehavior and dry-humping in blue jeans. Most of the cast doesnt know what to do with all the shallow characterizations and lackluster dialogue (gosh vulgarity can be dull) although Phyllis Smith has a party micro-adjusting her facial twitches as a nervous colleague. Too much of the plot revolves around a shrieky rival named Squirrel (Lucy Punch) who confronts the principal (John Michael Higgins) mid-bowl-movement and goes downhill from there. Every few scenes a gym teacher played by Jason Segel appears with pot or a pep talk for the heinous Ms. Halsey her boob-job fixation reflects low self-esteem the lamb. This is about as convincing as the chemistry between real-life exes Diaz and Timberlake whose character is too much of a dip to matter. He does have one memorable bit singing an idiotic love song (""How do you know when you know?/I guess you just know/Whoa whoa whoa whoa"") which made me laugh and I mean that literally. Otherwise the best lines were harvested for the trailer - so if youve seen that youve seen it all. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Open-Box Unlocked Galaxy S7 4G Android Phone for 420 + free...

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jun. 24 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 240PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Shame the flicks just a one-note joke because sight unseen Bad Teacher had me at the title. I mean weve all experienced some bad ones more than a few - the recognition factor is off the charts and so potentially are the laughs. And who hasnt grown weary of all those good teachers hogging the screen? In the movies (if nowhere else) educators are typically a dedicated bunch forever teaching math to the clueless or music to the tuneless or otherwise inspiring the intellectually challenged. Movies Bad Teacher The official trailer video Video Diaz on her Bad Teacher role Its high time then to bid goodbye to Mr. Chips and say hello to Miss Halsey who is refreshingly foul-mouthed and mean-minded and dedicated only to her narcissistic pursuits. Bad Teacher should be a hoot. But it isnt. Love the theory here hate the practice. The single note is struck early when Miss H. drawn to the profession by the classic motives of ""short hours summers off no accountability"" is seen in front of the class applying her patented pedagogical methods Show the students a movie fall asleep at her desk. From there the kids pretty much disappear and the script lumbers off on its own lesson plan. Hows this for instructional Halsey (Cameron Diaz) determines that the best way to find herself a rich husband is to buy herself bigger boobs. Surgery is expensive; money must be raised. Now if as comedic narratives go this strikes you as a trifle thin not to worry. Clearly a cum laude graduate of the no-plot school of cinema director Jake Kasdan has a ready answer. In lieu of a movie he gives us scenes. Oh lots of scenes. Like the one at the fundraising car wash where Cameron gets to wear really short shorts and a wet shirt. Or the one at the plastic surgeons office where she (and we right along with her) get to gaze fondly at samples of the docs handiwork. Or like the one in the bar where Justin Timberlake (the rich potential hubby) gets to wear Clark Kent glasses while playing the guitar badly and singing worse - a spectacle of ineptness that Timberlake fans will find amusing and non-fans will find unsurprising. And dont forget the scene in the mens washroom - always a reliable source of toilet humour. Speaking of potty mouth the jokes one note is pitched in the key of R for Restricted which liberates Miss Halsey et al. to speak many of those words-which-I-cant-repeat-here. Of course it also frees the writers from any compelling need to be clever. When in doubt just have the teach dole out another F. Anyway in her twin quest for lucre and mammarian largesse the bad teacher must contend with her nemesis the good teacher whose name Amy Squirrel pretty much says it all. Actually thats not true - I do the comedy a grave injustice. When obliged to eat an apple laced with poison ivy Amy Squirrel undergoes a hilarious metamorphosis into Amy Blotchy-Red-Faced Squirrel. Still lets be fair and do what teachers do Mark this thing on a bell curve and thus search hard for anyone or anything that merits a passing grade. Sorry not Cameron. Admittedly casts are blameless in these under-written overinflated affairs and Kasdan does his star no favours by lighting her to look less like an avid gold digger than a tired harlot. Nevertheless Cameron doesnt exactly improve matters unless you count turning a thankless role into a desperately thankless role. So the search continues. Oh wait. Watch closely and theres Jason Segel as the phys-ed guy He doesnt say much but as he surveys the mirthless mania around him his silences speak volumes. Even better sometimes his silences speak funny volumes. Yep give Jason full marks and ask yourself if this conforms to your school experience In Bad Teacher the gym teacher is the smartest of the lot and the sole saving grace.

"Bad Teacher movie review No class in this classroom |       NJ.com comments Bad Teacher movie review No class in this classroom Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on June 24 2011 at 743 AM updated June 24 2011 at 651 PM View/Post Comments COLUMBIACameron Diaz plays an educator who definitely isnt a role model in ""Bad Teacher."" ""Bad Teacher"" movie review You know those films about inspirational teachers people who make a difference? Films like ""Stand and Deliver""? ""Lean on Me""? ""Dangerous Minds""? Elizabeth Halsey knows them well. Because she shows all of them in class over and over so she can put her head down on her desk and sneak a nap and maybe recover from her latest hangover. Yes Elizabeth (Cameron Diaz) is a ""Bad Teacher."" And the film in which shes the anti-heroine is definitely in the defiant tradition of ""Bad Santa"" -- taking supposedly child-friendly figures and turning them into crude drunken equal-opportunity offenders. And getting big laughs while doing it. It was sort of a 50/50 gamble going in. Director Jake Kasdan did the intermittently funny ""The TV Set"" and the mostly unfunny ""Walk Hard""; the sceenwriters have plenty of ""The Office"" credits but also bear the blame for the unbearable ""Year One."" This one could have gone either way. That it succeeds is partly due to those filmmakers too. Kasdan keeps things moving so fast you tend not to mind the gags that dont work (mostly ones that confuse being rude and raunchy with just being stupid and grade-school gross). The screenwriters have taken the time to write more than one good character too; the movies called ""Bad Teacher"" but Elizabeth is hardly the only not-quite-ready-for-adulthood misfit who stumbles through it nor the most sympathetic one. And the fact that there are so many good comic bits here is whats allowed Kasdan to assemble a great comic cast. The movie of course belongs to Diaz. Shes always projected a sort of girlfriend-gone-wild sass that suggested shes a hell of a lot of fun after a couple of mango margaritas; ""Bad Teacher"" is one of the few films thats allowed her to show that. And not only does she show it she flaunts it from a wardrobe thats tighter than next years school budget to a vocabulary thats definitely not on any standardized test. But shes not alone. The wonderful Lucy Punch -- the gold digger from ""You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger"" -- is a nagging toothache as a too-perfect teacher. Comic actors such as Thomas Lennon drop by for brief but marvelous scenes and Jason Segal is a menschy gym teacher. Justin Timberlake however remains too cool to really commit to his oddball character a substitute teacher that the man-hungry Diaz fixates on. (That the two performers used to be an item though gives an extra level of comic discomfort to their scenes together). And for a movie thats supposed to be one long dirty joke ""Bad Teacher"" could be even more incorrect -- or at least topical. For all her talk Elizabeth never actually has sex nor are there many jabs at teachers unions or pushy parents -- two extremely fertile topics for satire. But the film is fast and often funny. And while its not for children -- really -- I bet the adults who just spent a school year with them are going to love it. Ratings note The film contains drug and alcohol use strong language sexual situations and violence. Bad Teacher (R) Columbia (89 min.) Directed by Jake Kasdan. With Cameron Diaz Justin Timberlake Jason Segel. Now playing in New Jersey.

And not in a good way. Starring Cameron Diaz Jason Segel Justin Timberlake Lucy Punch Thomas Lennon Noah Munck Molly Shannon Eric Stonestreet John Michael Higgins Phyllis Smith Director Jake Kasdan Release Opened Jun 24 2011  Editorial Review ""Bad Teacher"" reviewBy Ann HornadayFriday June 24 2011""Bad Teacher"" suffers from a truth-in-advertising problem. Fans of ""Bad Santa"" Terry Zwigoffs Christmas movie starring Billy Bob Thornton as a smoking drinking Kriss Kringle had reason to hope that ""Bad Teacher"" starring Cameron Diaz as a smoking drinking middle school teacher would be just as hilariously twisted. Instead this fitfully funny but mostly dull misfire defines exactly where the line can be drawn between truly subversive humor and lazy cynicism.Diaz brings her signature brand of blond va-va-vooms to Elizabeth Halsey a sultry surly self-absorbed gold digger who decided to become a teacher for what she deems ""the usual reasons short hours summers off and no accountability."" When her planned jackpot of a marriage comes up lemons shes forced to return to her old job at John Adams Middle School (JAMS) where she visibly recoils from the fatties nerds and poors shes forced to work with. As for actually teaching students its enough to pop ""Stand and Deliver"" or ""Lean on Me"" into the DVD player before she succumbs to the crippling hangover she habitually wakes up with.As every screenwriter knows movie protagonists need a compelling goal to keep viewer interest. In this case Elizabeth is working toward breast implants a hero quest that supplies ""Bad Teacher"" with plenty of lascivious sight gags. Shes also looking for another rich guy to marry and she sees potential in a new substitute teacher at JAMS a bespectacled sweetie named Scott Delacorte played in a disarmingly self-deprecating turn by Justin Timberlake.Timberlakes set pieces -- a musical number where he sings a bad song badly the funniest fully clothed sex scene since ""Harry Met Sally"" -- exemplify the all-too-fleeting moments of humor in ""Bad Teacher"" which was written by Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg (""Year One"") and directed without distinction by Jake Kasdan. A promising assortment of famous players from TV sitcoms -- including Jason Segel of ""How I Met Your Mother"" Phyllis Smith of ""The Office"" Eric Stonestreet of ""Modern Family"" and Noah Munck of ""iCarly"" -- make up a comic dream team of a supporting cast. But with the exception of Segel and his reliable laid-back flair theyre left with next to nothing to do but react with appalled awe to Elizabeths trademark vulgarity-strewn ripostes.As this summers surprise hit ""Bridesmaids"" proved lady-type-people are fully capable of raunchy comedy so Diaz swearing like a stevedore and slinging her sexuality like a six-gun arent particularly shocking. Instead what was playful and even progressive in ""Bridesmaids"" here feels strained and mean-spiritedly one-note as Elizabeth cuts an increasingly cruel swath through the school. She focuses most of her destructive energy on her nemesis an Up With People-ish teacher named Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch whose British accent here gives way to an utterly authentic Midwestern twang).What passes for a third-act turnaround is unconvincing and too slight to make an impact; and what passes for a happy ending feels rushed and unearned. It takes good filmmakers to make bad people if not sympathetic then at least interesting. ""Bad Teacher"" isnt good that way.

Photo Columbia Pictures Cameron Diaz and Justin Timberlake star in Columbia Pictures comedy ""Bad Teacher."" Justin Timberlake dry-humps Cameron Diaz while both are fully clothed in a bizarre scene that serves as a fairly convenient metaphor for the whole of ""Bad Teacher"" -- a fitfully amusing comedy that promises far more outrageousness than it actually delivers. Sure Diaz swears up a storm smokes pot steals test scores and spends far too much time zoning out while her students are watching movies. But shes nowhere near as transgressive as the hero of this movies apparent model Billy Bob Thornton in ""Bad Santa."" Yes Diaz deserves credit for trying to leave behind her basically sweet persona in a role that sort of acknowledges that even with a still-hot bod shes pushing 40. PHOTOS CAMERON DIAZS LEADING MEN She doesnt get nearly enough help though. The sloppy direction is by Jake Kasdan (""Walk Hard The Dewey Cox Story"") and the scattershot script is by Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg (TVs ""The Office""). Diazs character hates kids hates teaching and is engaged to a rich guy who will enable her to retire. When that plan falls apart she sets her sights anew on Timberlake a milquetoast millionaire who has just joined the staff as a substitute. Our heroine decides she needs a new pair of breasts to entice Timberlake not easily procured on her teachers salary. She solicits cash from parents for ""private tutoring and skims cash from the student car wash -- where she pumps up business in Daisy Dukes. She even seduces a state official (Thomas Lennon) to procure test answers in advance (while posing as a reporter) in order to collect a cash teaching award. Though Diaz talks dirty this sequence turns out to be rather chaste. Did the star or filmmakers decide they didnt want to go as raunchy as ""Bridesmaids?"" -- or even ""Theres Something About Mary"" which Diaz made 16 years ago? Or does the relatively brief running time suggest the studio got cold feet in the cutting room? Certainly ""Bad Teacher"" makes surprisingly little use of Timberlakes talent for self-deprecation. Jason Segal who shares co-star billing with Diaz and Timberlake also has remarkably little footage -- less than Phyllis Smith as a plump shy colleague who Diaz improbably befriends. But he makes the most of his role as a schlubby gym teacher who sees Diaz for exactly the opportunist she is -- and loves her anyway. Diazs best scenes are with him and the kids who she puts down mercilessly until she uncharacteristically takes pity on one young misfit. Most of the laughs are collected by Lucy Punch as chirpy borderline-psychotic teacher named Squirrel. Timberlake initially prefers her to Diaz but once Diaz starts moving in on him Punchs character starts reporting her bad behavior to the timid principal (John Michael Higgins). Then Punch escalates her war against Diaz -- pretty much making the main character in ""Bad Teacher"" look like Mother Teresa by comparison and stealing what little movie there is worth stealing. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Sean Kingston released from hospital Read Next Sean Kingston released from hospital Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 60635 How Hillary blew her big moment 29070 Malia Obama skipped the DNC for Lollapalooza 22392 Cop in bikini tackles bad guy Now On Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary Jill and Joe Biden stop traffic on Fifth Avenue Ex-Focus Features CEO thanks company for firing him SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Shes never needed to be; in the comedies shes always been a supporting character or a co-lead. That pattern of being at most mildly funny continues in Bad Teacher -- only this time its a problem because the movie is all about her. The teacher is bad sure but not funny. This unimaginatively raunchy comedy follows the Bad Santa mold by putting a reprobate in an occupation normally associated with saintlier types. Diaz plays Elizabeth Halsey a middle-school English teacher who drinks smokes pot swears at her students and spends every class period showing movies like Stand and Deliver and Dangerous Minds. A gold-digger by nature Elizabeth is only teaching (well ""teaching"") until she can land a rich husband. In the meantime she needs 10000 for a boob job so she steals from the school fundraiser. Thats only the beginning something to set the tone. In general the movie -- directed by Jake Kasdan (Orange County Walk Hard The Dewey Cox Story) -- has a pretty relaxed attitude about storyline preferring to shamble along from one episode to another as it covers Elizabeths school year. She has her eyes on Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake) a cheesy fellow teacher who comes from a wealthy family. She half-heartedly rebuffs the advances of the relatively decent gym teacher Russell (Jason Segel) whos broke. She is annoyed by her opposite Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch) the very picture of what a perky and dedicated middle-school teacher should be and who is more Scott Delacortes type to boot. The thread running through it all is that Elizabeth needs to come up with 10000. Theres nothing wrong with a dark comedy about a transgressive character who never really learns anything. The problem here isnt that Elizabeth is an unrepentantly awful person; its that shes an uncreatively awful person. Diaz performs with gusto but the screenplay (by Year One scribes Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg) doesnt give her many funny things to say. Shes rude petty and shallow -- but she rarely demonstrates it with anything better than a generic putdown. The very fact that she IS an awful person by itself is only amusing for a few minutes. So while Elizabeth is clearly meant to be a funny character most of the big laughs in the film -- and there are some -- come from the supporting cast. Lynn a timid fellow teacher is played by Phyllis Smith better known as Phyllis on The Office; her delivery as a square who wants to be cool is pitch-perfect. Lucy Punch is likewise terrific as goody-goody Ms. Squirrel who would be a fine enemy for Elizabeth if only Elizabeth herself were better defined. Theres John Michael Higgins as the nerdy Midwestern principal Thomas Lennon as an easily duped representative of the state testing board Matt Besser as a semi-enthusiastic Abraham Lincoln impersonator at a historical site Molly Shannon as the mother of one of Elizabeths students -- all sharp comic actors all adept at shining during their few moments at center stage. But we must return to the curiously underdeveloped parts of the film. The screenplay awkwardly implies that Scott Delacrote is a conservative prude but doesnt define it very well or give Timberlake much to work with and Timberlake grasping at straws plays the role like an SNL character. When it comes time for Scotts big moment -- a bizarre sex scene -- I was more puzzled than amused because nothing had been done to establish WHY he would be acting this way. Similarly there are oblique mentions of a mental breakdown Ms. Squirrel had a few years ago but no payoff to it. Then theres Elizabeths weird roommate (Eric Stonestreet) whose thing is that hes ... dumb? Intimidating? Crazy? He shows up in just a couple scenes long enough for you to feel like he was supposed to be more fleshed out than he is. Thats the movie in a nutshell solid premise good cast not enough fleshing out. Bad Teacher is eager to wring laughs out of naughtiness but doesnt expend enough effort to get them. Just being bad isnt sufficiently funny. You have to be bad in creative clever and original ways.

"Icky Bad Teacher fails on all fronts - USATODAY.com Skip to Main Content USA TODAY Subscribe Mobile Home News Travel Money Sports Life Your Life Tech Weather Icky Bad Teacher fails on all fronts By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Updated | | Share Reprints amp; Permissions Bad Teacher is rotten to the core. By Gemma LaMana Columbia Pictures Cameron Diazs gold-digging teacher is odious and unfunny. EnlargeClose By Gemma LaMana Columbia Pictures Cameron Diazs gold-digging teacher is odious and unfunny. Cameron Diaz plays Elizabeth Halsey a hard-partying bad apple of an educator. Crude rude and a lazy stoner she somehow stumbled into teaching though her real dream is to be a trophy wife. On the first day of class she pops in a DVD of Stand and Deliver then puts her head down on her desk and naps. STORY Stars tell tales out of school She puts slightly more energy into finding a meal ticket who will keep her in spike-heeled Louboutins and sporty foreign cars. Were not saying shes a gold digger but she wont be going out with any broke fellow teachers. PHOTOS See the stars on the set Still Russell (Jason Segel) a likable PE instructor is itching for a date. They apparently have lots in common because both like to smoke weed and neither can climb a gymnasium rope. Thats pretty much all anyone needs for a romance in Hollywood. Russell is as decent as Elizabeth is repellent. Her string of lies schemes and lack of concern for anyone else essentially makes her a sociopath. Worse for a comedy shes not a very funny character. Segel generates a few laughs as does Justin Timberlake as an earnest teacher Elizabeth tries to land when she discovers hes from a rich family. About the film Bad Teacher  1 1/2 out of four Stars Cameron Diaz Justin Timberlake Lucy Punch Jason Segel John Michael Higgins Director Jake Kasdan DistributorColumbia Pictures Rating R for sexual content nudity language and some drug use Running time 1 hour 29 minutes Opens Friday nationwide The films rhythms are disjointed and there are tedious patches and gaping holes in the story. No one bothered to create anything beyond a vague outline of a superficial character. Elizabeth is not dumb so why she chose teaching when she has so little regard for students or the educational process is a mystery. And if shes bent on meeting rich guys there are better places to do it. Even in a silly comedy there should be some sense of the lead characters motives and back story if the audience is expected to give a hoot. Elizabeth is convinced that shes an 81/2 but if she had D cups shed be a 10. To raise 10000 for breast augmentation she resorts to pilfering from a school fund blackmailing an administrator stealing standardized tests and planting drugs on a fellow teacher (Lucy Punch). Still were supposed to find her charming. Or maybe were supposed to overlook her transgressions because she decides against surgery and embraces her nearly perfect physique. Ah the redemption. Diaz brings little but her blond good looks to the role. Then again she was not given much material to work with. Just rewatch 1998s Theres Something About Mary to be reminded she once was funny. Misanthropic to the extreme Bad Teacher fails across the board. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

Comments click to enlarge Bad Teacher Video Rated R  92 minutes  2011 Cameron Diaz stars as a booze-slamming pot-smoking gold-digging middle school teacher in the Chicago public school system. Even a passing familiarity with our screwed-up schools self-serving teachers union and politics-ridden board of education might have inspired an ice-cold social satire but of course screenwriters Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg (both veterans of NBCs The Office) pitch this to the C students. Technically the movie is a mess--sloppy editing obvious postdubbing plot complications either introduced and abandoned or papered over altogether. Yet Diaz costars Jason Segel and Justin Timberlake and a sharp supporting cast (Lucy Punch Phyllis Smith Thomas Lennon John Michael Higgins) manage to deliver a crappy good time mercifully devoid of any heart-tugging teacher-student subplots.

Satiric surreal fun; Bad Teacher and star Diaz make no grade Watch a clip from the film ""Cars 2"" courtesy Walt Disney Pictures. By Joe Morgenstern June 24 2011 Five years ago when ""Cars"" proved to be Pixars first less-than-stellar animated feature an animator friend offered his theory about why. Cars he said can have faces but they dont have hands; theres only so much you can have them do. To make up for their lack of hands the cars in ""Cars 2"" do all sorts of cool things with their front tires and the 3-D animation as a whole is spectacular. But the movie has its own deficits--a lack of variety originality subtlety clarity and plain old charm. The law of averages has finally caught up with the most remarkable studio in modern movie history the dream factory that lived up to Buzz Lightyears joyous cry of ""To infinity and beyond."" This frenzied sequel seldom gets beyond mediocrity. ENLARGE Lightning McQueen and Tow Mater in Cars 2. Disney/Pixar Theres certainly no lack of clarity in the calculations behind Pixars swerve. In the five years since ""Cars"" was released the movie has sold something in the neighborhood of 10 billion in merchandise--cute little cars trucks and other vehicles that keep rolling off the toymakers assembly lines in epic numbers. To sustain such financial numbers--and to pave the way for next summers opening of a 12-acre Cars Land at Disneys California Adventure Park--Pixar and Disney the animation studios relatively new owner needed a hard-sell crowd-pleaser with exactly the sort of high-octane action and high-decibel soundtrack that energizes--or blights depending on your point of view--""Cars 2."" This is something new for Pixar a movie in which characterization and deep feelings take a back seat to breakneck pace and something new for Pixar lovers including me who may find themselves wondering if Disneys master merchandisers are starting to call the tune for Pixars master storytellers. The story here concerns a pair of American innocents abroad--Lightning McQueen the bright-red race car brightly voiced by Owen Wilson and Tow Mater the buck-toothed good-hearted tow truck who speaks in the cornpone tones of Larry the Cable Guy. Taking their leave of Radiator Springs the time-warpy desert town that served as the setting for ""Cars"" the two buddies head for Europe where Lightning enters the first of several competitions in the World Grand Prix and Mater is mistaken for a spy. The repetitive race sequences--vroom vroom vrooming at warp speed--are intercut with a James Bond spoof that centers on Finn McMissile a supercar with superweapons voiced by Michael Caine and that starts the action in a preface set on a giant oil platform at sea. (The preface to ""Toy Story 3"" which was absurdly and delightfully over the top turned out to be Andys fantasy. This one elaborate but clumsy is part of the narrative.) From one moment to the next ""Cars 2"" comes up with plenty of visual zingers a Parisian marche aux pieces (as in spare parts); a plunge into the giant clockworks of Londons Big Bentley; a Japanese toilet designed to pamper any chassis; exotic cars galore including such exotic lemons as the Pacer the Gremlin and what the movie calls the Hugo. And as cool as the story tends to be on a scale of emotional temperature it does evoke an affecting friendship between Lightning and Mater one thats tested by driving ambition and a deadly bomb. Still this is a Pixar animated feature were talking about a film from the people who brought genuine enchantment into our lives with tales of toys come alive of beguiling bugs fantastical fishies impassioned robots and self-reflective superheroes. Whats more its a film co-directed (with Brad Lewis) by John Lasseter the man who more than anyone else has embodied the studios spirit from the days when he used a computer to create a pioneering Pixar short about a couple of desk lamps. By now its a commonplace that Mr. Lasseter whose father was a parts-department manager in a Chevy dealership in Southern California was prompted to make the first ""Cars"" by profound car love. That film for all its odd mixture of tedium and frenzy operated within recognizable Pixar parameters. But in this one cars seem unconstrained by the laws of physics and writers seemed unconcerned with developing character as opposed to belaboring it. (Mater gets to be as maddening as that old Hollywood yodeler Andy Devine.) For Pixars sake and for ours lets hope that the fast track of ""Cars 2"" is a temporary detour. Watch a clip from the film ""The Names of Love"" courtesy Music Box Films. ENLARGE Sara Forestier and Jacques Gamblin in The Names of Love. Music Box Films The Names of Love ""Our two families embody France"" says Baya Benmahmoud the delightful heroine of Michel Leclercs sharp-witted sometimes surreal and largely autobiographical French-language comedy which he directed from a script he wrote with Baya Kasmi. So they do in many ways though not necessarily in the amorous way one might infer from the misleading English title. Baya who is played by Sara Forestier has an earnest Algerian father and a screwy French mother. The filmmakers surrogate Arthur Martin (Jacques Gamblin) has a Jewish mother of immigrant parents and a father who served in the Algerian war. The political intricacies on both sides are too complex to detail here while the comedy flows with daunting fluency from the ostensibly mismatched lovers. Baya a sentimental left-winger who is as volatile as she is alluring sleeps with conservatives in order to convert them; she considers her body a weapon with which to destroy the right wing. Arthur a middle-age middle-of-the-roader studies bird flu as a scientist; at one point he cant sleep with Baya because he must perform a necropsy on suspect geese. ""The Names of Love"" isnt a completely misleading title since love along with lovemaking does prevail. Still the original title ""Le Nom des Gens""--literally ""Peoples Names""--comes much closer to conveying the storys essence. Mr. Leclercs movie in French with good English subtitles often plays like romantic comedy but its really a sophisticated burlesque about the significance of surnames (his is comically common hers misleads people into thinking shes Brazilian) plus some quintessentially French obsessions the trap of racial identity; the politics of ethnicity and the fateful power of the past populated as it is for Baya and Arthur by ancestors who suffered for them dreamed for them and loved them. ENLARGE Cameron Diaz in Bad Teacher. Columbia Pictures Watch a clip from ""Bad Teacher"" starring Cameron Diaz Justin Timberlake and Jason Segel. Bad Teacher From the evidence on screen no one who made this alleged comedy ever noticed that no one in it was remotely likable. The heroine Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz) has been teaching at a middle school to kill time until her impending marriage to a rich guy. Her academic qualifications are never in evidence but she is manifestly a lazy cynical oversexed unprincipled foul-mouthed pot-puffing booze-slugging gold-digging slut who is not only dislikable but unfunny. Then her marriage plans go awry and her flaws multiply. Have talented actors ever struggled so much to so little avail? Ms. Diaz sells her lines like a street vendor peddling fake Timexes. Lucy Punch mugs and pouts as Elizabeths rival Amy Squirrel. Justin Timberlake plays the creepily fey Scott Delacorte a rich substitute teacher who sings a ghastly song called ""Simpatico."" (""Ask me how much I love you. A lottico."") Only Jason Segel finds a few fugitive flashes of likability--yes Im backtracking a bit here--as a gym teacher named Russell Gettis. (Lots more gravitas in that name than in Squirrel.) How did ""Bad Teacher"" which was directed by Jake Kasdan come into being? Maybe someone having seen Jack Black in ""The School of Rock"" decided to do something even raunchier with a female teacher (and failed to notice that both the star and his material were terrifically funny.) Or maybe the production began--as it should have ended--with the clever risque poster that shows among other things Ms. Diaz with her booted feet on a teachers desk. How much do I loathe this film? A lottico is putting it mildico. DVD FOCUS A Bugs Life (1998) The second Pixar feature this animated fable teems with vivid creatures standing on their own countless feet. The ant hero Flik (Dave Foley) wants to throw off the tyranny of the grasshoppers who led by the malevolent Hopper (Kevin Spacey) demand a huge cut of every harvest. Journeying forth to the big city in search of help Flik mistakes the members of a broken-down flea circus for puissant warriors brings them back home and presents them as the colonys saviors. The clowns redeem themselves but only by helping fearful antdom find the courage to get real and hang tough. Amelie (2001) Jean-Pierre Jeunets French-language fable isnt about racial identity or any of the other preoccupations of ""The Names of Love."" As a stylistic tour de force though it has been hugely influential on many filmmakers of varied ethnicities. First the film conjures up a telepathic but touchingly fragile heroine played by Audrey Tautou who rearranges other peoples lives even though shes terrified to live her own. Then the movie puts this elfin do-gooder/do-badder at the center of a fanciful world that looks like everyones idealized notion of Paris no crowds no dirt no traffic no permanent grief. Any Given Sunday (1999) Thinking about Cameron Diaz may not put you in mind of Oliver Stones movie about human worth vs. net worth but its entertaining all the same. Al Pacino is an aging coach who still thinks the game should be fun. Ms. Diaz is Christina Pagniacci a steely young franchise owner and Jamie Foxx is Willie Beamen a headstrong quarterback who brings Christinas team a star quality that she covets. If the field is tilted toward traditional values thats the fun of this fantasy version of the NFL in which morality finally proves a smoother lubricant than corporate moolah.

Here were more concerned with the mock-shock screenplay futilely in search of a story and the characters that could have been created on an Etch A Sketch.Step to the front of the class Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz). Elizabeth is a brazen gold digger who just wants to save enough cash to get the breast implants that may help her land the big fish of her dreams. For reasons of plot contrivance needed to facilitate a movie called Bad Teacher she decides she can best achieve her goals by instructing seventh-graders.We seem to have reached a point where comedy writers can just lean back on some variation of the adjective ""bad"" placed before a generic authority figure Bad Santa (which had the courage of its rotten convictions) Bad Teacher and the upcoming Horrible Bosses. Thats all well and good if you can weave the badness into something resembling a story.Bad Teacher makes some cursory gestures in this direction. Elizabeth has a foil the psychotically perky Amy Squirrel (the divine Lucy Punch). She has a target in a wealthy substitute teacher -- yes you read that correctly -- played by Justin Timberlake by now a master of shallow smarm (he gets to perform a song that would make a dandy Saturday Night Live digital short). She has a suitor in Jason Segels likable schlub of a gym teacher. She has a zonked-out roommate (Modern Familys Eric Stone-street who steals the screen the few times he appears).The above combine for some sporadic strung-together laughs most of them provided by the secondary players. Bad Teacher belongs to the school of comedy in which characters need not resemble anyone you might encounter in the real world and things happen just well because. That works for a couple of minutes here and there but when fully developed (and funnier) comedies such as Bridesmaids and Midnight in Paris are out there this skim alternative feels flimsy and overly eager to congratulate itself on its own knee-jerk naughtiness.Sure bad can be funny but is that all youve got?Bad TeacherC Starring Cameron Diaz Justin Timberlake Lucy Punch Jason Segel Thomas Lennon and Eric Stonestreet.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Agreeably off-color and endlessly inappropriate the R-rated Cameron Diaz comedy ""Bad Teacher"" makes a homecoming bonfire out of schoolroom pieties and drags heroic-educator yarns into the boys bathroom for a swirlie. The story wisely doesnt waste much time setting up a premise weve already accepted. Diaz plays Elizabeth Halsey a Chicagoland middle-school instructor whose back-to-school supplies include stiletto heels airplane bottles of Jack Daniels and a wardrobe clingier than the shrink wrap on a new CD. Her classroom philosophy is Leave Every Child Behind conserving her energy for extracurricular pursuits. Her ambition is to land a rich dupe who will take her far from the backpack brigade and the frumps and trolls in the Teachers Lounge. A likely prospect is substitute teacher Simon Delacorte (Justin Timberlake) a preppy nimrod with oodles of family money. Reeling him in proves tough even for a nine-faced Machiavellian. Simon has a natural affinity for Elizabeths childlike coquettish colleague Amy (Lucy Punch) whose twinkly pep-fest approach to inspiring her class is a good argument for home schooling. Elizabeth is convinced that shes just a boob job away from stealing Simon from the curvaceous Amy. Her schemes to finance the operation on a teachers salary provide a vehicle for some scurrilous but rather funny gags. Amys rising suspicions set her on an angry collision course with Elizabeth. The film pulls the neat trick of shifting our sympathies from the wronged but insufferably self-righteous do-gooder to her nemesis who is catty and calculating but not quite heartless or psychotic. Director Jake Kasdan (""Walk Hard The Dewey Cox Story"") has pulled together a fine kooky supporting cast. Jason Segal plays a gym teacher who just might unclog the stopped-up septic tank of Elizabeths heart; if you cant see the ending from 12 blocks away youll have to stay after class. John Michael Higgins (""The Ugly Truth"") plays the oblivious principal Phyllis Smith (""The Office"") is a soft-spoken co-worker and Thomas Lennon soars as a state administrator who becomes a pawn in Elizabeths schemes. Everyone earns their laughs -- from the dry and Seinfeldian to the lowdown and dirty -- while still allowing their characters to feel like real people. Or wildly inflated caricatures of real people. ""Bad Teacher"" is Diazs show however and she contributes a performance that doesnt feel like it came from the stock comedy character catalog. This one may not sit at the head of the class but it earns a smattering of gold stars. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Sadly it only took about 10 minutes to wipe the smile off my face. Bad Teacher keeps running away from its combustibly nasty premise. Damn shame. Diaz looks ready to shock as Elizabeth Halsey a 7th grade educator buried in Illinois where teaching credentials are clearly way too easy to come by. On her first day Miss Halsey props her Christian Louboutin heels on her desk runs a DVD of Edward James Olmos teaching tough in Stand and Deliver and proceeds to sleep off whatever wasted her the night before. Prim colleague Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch in the films stellar comic turn) is scandalized but gym teacher Russell Gettis (Jason Segel charmingly lowkey) is the bee to Elizabeths honey. Bury your stinger buddy. Elizabeths personal syllabus is all about finding a new sugar dude to replace the rich fiance (Nat Faxon) who kicked her to the curb. Bachelor No. 1 is teacher Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake) from a wrist-watch fortune.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> The problem is Scotts last love had ginormous breasts which means Elizabeth will need a quick 10000 for a boob job. Having that that sinking feeling yet? Thinking that misogynys ugly head is lurking behind every frame? It gets much worse. The script by Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg (Year One OMFG)) gives director Jake Kasdan (Walk Hard The Dewey Cox Story) scraps to work with forcing the overqualified cast to strain hard for laughs. The dry-humping scene with Diaz and former flame Timberlake falls embarrassingly flat. The students in the movie barely register except as punching bags. And the editing has the subtle edge of a buzzsaw. How did Elizabeth even become a teacher? The movie doesnt know or care. So why should we?

(LaMana) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday June 23 2011 328 PM Title Bad Teacher A gold-digging teacher searches for a rich man. With Cameron Diaz Justin Timberlake. Director Jake Kasdan. (138). R Language sex drugs crude humor. At area theaters. Given that she starred in ""Theres Something About Mary"" Cameron Diaz clearly knows a thing or two about shock comedy. So its hard to say why she chose this underachiever which -- unlike its obvious inspiration ""Bad Santa"" -- barely makes the grade in either humor or provocation. All hard edges and flaunted curves Diazs Elizabeth Halsey is the worlds hottest and most hateful teacher. Deservedly dumped by her rich fiance she immediately starts plotting to land another big fish. Deciding that pricy breast implants will be the bait she lies cheats and steals to raise enough cash to supplement her middle-school salary. This leaves little time to teach but that suits her just fine as far as shes concerned students are a distraction best ignored anyway. Surprisingly enough the disjointed script -- which relies more on concept than cleverness -- was written by Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg whove been responsible for some of the funniest episodes of ""The Office."" Director Jake Kasdan encourages cartoonish turns to match so the talented supporting players are left to flounder. Most disappointing is Lucy Punch a gifted comic actress who cant find a single element of humanity in her broad caricature of Elizabeths uptight rival. While Justin Timberlake does better with his ill-defined role as the schools weird new substitute its Jason Segels deadpan gym teacher who comes closest to grounding the film. As for Diaz theres no denying she looks great and commits impressively to Elizabeths utter lack of morality. Unfortunately the filmmakers never give us a single reason to root for such a miserable character whose comic appeal rarely reaches further than dirty words and bad behavior. The whole cast works hard but theres only so much even A-list actors can do with a C-level script theyre stuck in a one-joke movie and the title gives the punchline away. Magic Moment Timberlakes musical solo in which . . . he cant sing at all.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + ""Bad Teacher is supposed to be Cameron Diaz playing the worlds most pathetic middle-school teacher. Shes a stoner who is in the classroom because she lacks the ambition to do anything else. This movie is what you do when you have never been to school or dont like education. Or movies comedies women breasts sex or dodgeball. In a movie like this in which Diaz purports to wash cars wearing short-shorts and mile-high espadrilles yet only she seems to get wet you learn more about the moviemakers than anyone in the movie They have a very sad erotic life.The fiance of Diazs character Elizabeth dumps her after her gold-digging can no longer be ignored. The movie just sends her into a spiral of caustic depression thats never funny enough. Class with her consists of playing DVDs of goodish Hollywood movies like ""Stand and Deliver ""Lean on Me and ""Dangerous Minds movies about brown kids fighting to subsist in bad situations while she texts or drinks or sleeps. ""Bad Teacher assumes that a mocking awareness of those movies permits this one to deploy jokey casual racism. Were made to understand that one terrible but terribly dedicated teachers new job at someplace called Malcolm X High School is a punishment. Presumably her time there will make her the subject of a much better film.Back in this movie Elizabeth turns man-hungry and sets her appetite on the bank account of new teacher (Justin Timberlake) whos got his eye on the prudent dingbat (Lucy Punch) who from across the hall has been tallying Elizabeths ethical lapses. Meanwhile the blocky P.E. teacher (Jason Segel) tells Elizabeth that she needs to work so desperately to raise the money for the breast augmentation the filmmakers want her to have. News of a 5700 bonus actually inspires her to teach. To be fair if these nonmasculine men are the only options I might go to work depressed too.Diaz has no character to play. She just makes her way through the backhandedly hateful fantasies about women one acquires mostly from an adolescence spent listening to Eazy E while watching Whitesnake videos. To which one can say only that Tawny Kitaen was a woman who knew how to wash a car.You dont want to think what would Preston Sturges or Alexander Payne do with this material? But there is a seed of satirical cynicism in this movie that a smart clear mind could have finessed. Jake Kasdan is not that director. He doesnt appear to know what to do. He just sprays the screen with shots of swollen pants pot fumes soiled pants fake breasts and Diazs rear. Ah Diazs rear. Its how movies let us know women didnt make them. Shes the butt of too many jokes. Over the years rooting for Diaz has become like rooting for say the Chicago Cubs a lost cause thats turned into a habit. But eventually in Diazs case a diehard has to confront the reality that her worst enemy is herself. She might be incapable of staying aligned with directors who want the best for her and surrounds herself instead with guys who like to play with Barbie.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com or followed on Twitter wesley_morris.

More about Bad Teacher >> Elizabeth Halsey the middle-school instructress played by Cameron Diaz in Bad Teacher is just such a dedicated educator - if your goals in life are to down a lot of booze smoke a lot of weed and marry into money. A raunchy comedy thats funnier to think about than to watch (yes the best stuff is in the trailer) Bad Teacher does boast some pricelessly derisive turns from Diaz who swings her hips through John Adams Middle School dressed to kill rolling her eyes at her fellow faculty members and keeping her distance from the pimply brats and awkward tweens crowding the corridors. First day of class? She pulls the TV monitor up and puts on Stand and Deliver aghast that not one of her pip-squeaks is familiar with the Edward James Olmos inspirational classic. Next up on the queue Dangerous Minds. Directed by Jake Kasdan from a screenplay credited to Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky (a writer/producer team from The Office) Bad Teacher is a promising concept in need of more promising material. The jokes are for the most part default-mode dirty - not so much outrageous as just inevitable. Breast enhancement gags? Got em. Lesbian one-liners? Check. Some graphic descriptions of condom use? Afraid so. When her plans to nab a sugar daddy are foiled by her targets rightly suspicious mother Diazs Halsey finds herself back at John Adams for a second year. Things couldnt be more depressing until she bumps into a new colleague a bow-tied and bespectacled Scott Delacorte who teaches because he loves to and just happens to be the heir to a watch fortune. Justin Timberlake - who was once according to my sources at US Weekly in a relationship with Ms. Diaz - essays the role of this impossibly earnest Mr. Nice with a game comedic face. Here too however the writing isnt up to the performance. Even Timberlake seems worn down after a while. As Halsey stalks her prey - and plots how to raise 10000 for the aforementioned breast implants a plot that involves such honorable enterprises as embezzlement and fixing the scores on a statewide student exam - her nemesis and rival for Delacortes affection tries to convince anyone who will listen that Halsey is a deadbeat a golddigger a cheat. Lucy Punch engagingly kooky (and kinky) in You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger and Dinner for Schmucks is Amy Squirrel the goody-two-shoes who goes toe to toe with Diaz. And then theres lunky Jason Segel as the Average Joe gym teacher who cant seem to get Halsey interested in him - but isnt about to give up. And did anyone say redemption? This is after all Hollywood and in Bad Teacher of course even the title character turns out to be good. Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

"Bad Teacher (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Bad Teacher (R) As uneven as that wobbly desk you got stuck with in seventh grade Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle | cogleMiamiHerald.com6/28/2011 Editor rating 2.5 All legs and hair and eyeliner and attitude Cameron Diaz makes a formidable bad teacher in the raunchy new comedy from director Jake Kasdan ( Walk Hard The Dewey Cox Story Orange County). Shes nasty conniving and selfish as Elizabeth Halsey a middle-school instructor who cares more about scamming money for breast implants than about student participation or test scores. Diaz is funny all right but she is no miracle worker so she cant erase the movies slow spots or make it feel shorter than its 92-minute running time (it feels much much longer never a good sign for a comedy). Bad Teacher is as uneven as that wobbly desk you got stuck with in seventh grade. Its amusing in plenty of spots but wastes too much time focusing on jokes that are repetitive and exaggerated (Lucy Punch as Miss Squirrel the gung-ho goody-two-shoes teacher determined to expose her rival as a drug-addled cheater) instead of rewarding better characters with more screen time (Jason Segal as a laid-back gym coach intrigued by Elizabeth is the films secret weapon and hes virtually invisible for the first half hour or so). As the film opens Elizabeth is saying goodbye to the colleagues she despises at John Adams Middle School (or ""JAMS"") happy to be leaving her job to marry a rich guy. But hes onto the fact that shes only after his money and dumps her leaving Elizabeth with no choice but to return to the world of preteen crushes school dances and long dull mornings of sleeping off hangovers at her desk while her students dutifully watch Stand and Deliver. Then a savior arrives in the form of substitute teacher Scott (an appropriately goofy Justin Timberlake who turns out to be a braver comedian than you may have imagined). Scott reveals that his family has money. Elizabeth immediately starts trying to seduce him but foiled by Scotts general cluelessness realizes she must formulate another plan of attack. She believes she needs the breasts of her dreams to pry Scotts attention from the squeaky-clean charms of Miss Squirrel and she knows she cant afford them on a teachers salary. Like most good comedies Bad Teacher is populated by familiar character actors. Some contribute greatly such as Phyllis Smith from The Office as Elizabeths shy (and only) friend on the staff or Eric Stonestreet of Modern Family as Elizabeths slovenly roommate (she found him on Craigslist). Others must grovel unbecomingly for laughs like Molly Shannon as an over-eager parent of one of Elizabeths lovelorn students or comic veteran John Michael Higgins as the principal whos obsessed with dolphins a joke to which Bad Teacher returns over and over though it never pays off. But when Elizabeth inevitably starts caring about her students success -- for all the wrong reasons naturally -- and gradually grasps the sly appeal of the gym coach Bad Teacher takes off. Thank Segal in part because the guy is always funny and Timberlake gets some of the biggest laughs in a particularly crude sex scene (though the song with which his character woos Miss Squirrel is perhaps the films funniest moment). The movie may not earn an A+ but at least its far from getting an F. Movie Info Cast Cameron Diaz Jason Segal Justin Timberlake Lucy Punch. Director Jake Kasdan.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The similarities between Bad Teacher and the beloved 2003 Yuletide black comedy Bad Santa begin with the titles and they dont end until Bad Teacher does. Both films take the form of curdled dark comedies about raging misanthropes who abuse their positions of authority--or at least their power over small children since drunken mall Santas and Chicagos public-school teachers both lack real power--to engage in criminal schemes. And both films are fundamentally redemption comedies about anti-heroes who might ultimately be beyond redemption. Bad Teacher isnt subtle in its ""borrowing"" from its clear inspiration but it is savvy. In a performance that plays to her strengths as a ballsy vulgar physical comedienne Cameron Diaz stars as a hard-living mean-spirited gold-digger biding her time as a teacher until her marriage to a foppish rich man frees her from a life of semi-honest labor. But when her wealthy fiance dumps her shes forced to scramble for a plan B. She sets her sights on an exquisitely unselfconscious goober a wealthy substitute teacher played by Justin Timberlake with just the right note of utterly unearned geek bravado. Meanwhile charming slacker gym teacher Jason Segel patiently waits for Diaz to get over herself enough to appreciate his humble charms and to a lesser extent get the fake breasts shes stealing and scheming to raise money to buy. Director Jake Kasdan hasnt had much luck commercially with three fine comedies (Zero Effect The TV Set Walk Hard) that didnt find cult audiences until they flopped in theaters so perhaps it isnt surprising that Bad Teachers tone is broad crowd-pleasing and unapologetically commercial. For a mainstream studio comedy its agreeably nasty and dotted with moments of cruelly satisfying cultural specificity like a hippie teacher played by Freaks And Geeks Dave ""Gruber"" Allen rocking out in middle-of-the-road ecstasy to Shawn Mullins ""Lullaby"" or Timberlakes pride in boldly exploring the world of ethnic cuisine by going to an Ethiopian restaurant. But Bad Teacher is really Diazs show as much as Bad Santa belonged to Billy Bob Thornton. Teacher underutilizes a smartly cast-against-type Timberlake and the perpetually winning Segel but Diaz ultimately earns a rooting interest in the unlikely redemption of her scheming opportunist. Considering how utterly repellent she is in the films misanthropic early scenes thats an impressive feat.

"Bad Teacher | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; bad-teacher ) Bad Teacher (United States 2011) June 23 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli Bad Teacher takes a delicious premise and leaves a sour aftertaste. Despite the promise of something nasty and cutting the film turns out to be as edgy as a dull razor with limp ""raunchy"" comedy and an unwillingness to push envelopes. The concept titillates - an oversexed drug-abusing foul-mouthed doesnt-give-a-shit woman put in charge of a classroom - but the result is drab obvious and disappointing. Despite the existence of Bad Santa as an obvious template Bad Teacher doesnt want to be dark (or at least not too dark); it wants to be naughty enough to get an R-rated but not so naughty that it will shock viewers. The product is akin to a mediocre 80s sex comedy (with minimal nudity) and ""daring"" is a descriptor only the most naA-ve and puritanical would employ. Cameron Diazs Elizabeth Halsey is the title character. Its an open question why anyone would hire her to teach junior high (although her legs might have something to do with it) but were supposed to accept the premise that the Worst Teacher in the Civilized World is somehow skating by without anyone noticing her shortcomings except her nutty co-worker Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch). The reason Elizabeth needs a job is because her ex-fiancA(c) figured out that shes a gold-digger and canceled the wedding. So Elizabeth is out to find a new sugar daddy and as a means of enhancing her appeal she has decided to get a boob job. Finding a spare 10000 is proving difficult. For Mr. Moneybags she has set her sights on geeky substitute teacher Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake) whose family is rich. To that end she goes to war with Amy who is dating Scott and ignores the advances of gym teacher Russell Gettis (Jason Segel). In Bad Santa Billy Bob Thornton played an unrepentant misanthrope. Even the ""sunny"" conclusion is designed more as a send-up of feel-good endings that an instance of genuine redemption. Would that a similar approach had been used with Elizabeth Halsey. Despite her obvious personality defects the screenplay doesnt want to make her too unlikeable. And therein lies the problem. For Bad Teacher to work as the raunchy black comedy it wants to be Elizabeth has to be the educational equivalent of a nymphomaniac Nurse Ratched. But the filmmakers want viewers to kinda sorta like her. They want her to be appealing more of an anti-heroine than a villain. It doesnt work; she comes across as a lame caricature. Elizabeth is surrounded with equally cartoonish characters. Amy is the typical goody two-shoes whose sunny exterior hides an interior ugliness. Scott is a teenager in an adults body; his idea of hot sex is dry humping. Principal Snur (John Michael Higgins) is a moron with a dolphin fetish. Gym teacher Russell is the only ""normal"" individual in the film resulting in his seeming out-of-place. Diaz is unconvincing as the slutty hungover Elizabeth. She wears the clothes and spouts the profanity but I never bought the character even in a comedy/parody sense. I am forced to wonder whether the original script was a lot harder and nastier but was softened when Diaz came on board. Its hard to say whether Bad Teacher fails because the original screenplay didnt take enough chances or because agent/studio interference forced director Jake Kasdan and the writers to emasculate the narrative to avoid what happened to Observe and Report. The supporting cast is mostly solid with Punch and Timberlake embracing the vapidity of their characters and Jason Segel bringing elements of warmth and humor to Russell. Despite the movies overall weakness there are isolated scenes that work such as the car wash and the sequence in which Elizabeth devises an unusual punishment/reward system involving a dodge ball. The comedy is tepid however. A decade ago it might have been deemed risky. Today with so many films (like The Hangover Part II) pushing the R-rating to its limits even Bad Teachers most outrageously gauche humor feels safe. The movie had an opportunity to do for the classroom what Bad Santa did for Christmas but the filmmakers courage went on summer vacation.

Bad Teacher Fair Director Jake Kasdan. Cast Cameron Diaz Jason Segel Justin Timberlake. Rating R for sexual content nudity language and some drug use. This weeks new movie releases Spotlight Cameron Diaz Cameron Diaz is fine as a gold-digging teacher who spends more time drinking smoking dope and either insulting or ignoring her students than she does actually instructing them (mostly she shows movies). Lucy Punch is good as a maddeningly over-enthusiastic colleague. Justin Timberlake is mostly wasted as a rich guy who substitute teaches but hes game for just about anything. But somehow the characters - and their story - dont come together in a satisfying way. Top 11 hottest teachers in film | Interview Diaz Segel and Timberlake on Bad Teacher. Director Jake Kasdan coaxes some laughs out of the film but only Jason Segel as a cynical gym teacher seems like a real person instead of a caricature. Everyone else seems like theyre trying just a touch too hard. Elizabeth Halsey (Diaz) gets dumped by the rich guy she was going to marry for money forcing her to come back for another year of teaching junior-high English. But she is not without goals; her immediate one is to figure out how to get enough money to pay for breast implants which she thinks will help her more easily land a replacement sugar daddy. The operation is tough to afford on a teachers salary of course. But one day handsome Scott Delacorte (Timberlake) the heir to a watch-making fortune shows up as a substitute teacher giving Elizabeth a suitable target. But Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch) an impossibly cheery teacher figures out what Elizabeth is up to and sets her own sights on Scott. Shes successful for a while but is ultimately out of her league competing with Elizabeth who has the advantage of having no morals whatsoever - except of course when the movie needs her to. Meanwhile Russell Gettis (Jason Segel) a P.E. teacher who sees right through Elizabeth but also sees her which isnt hard with her taut body always on display lets Elizabeth know her constant rejection wont be dissuading him from pursuing her. As the only character not dialed up a notch or two too high hes a refreshing relief. Kasden and writers Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg construct the film as a series of set pieces some funnier than others. When Elizabeth learns there is money to be had in having the class with the best standardized test scores its amusing to see her shift into action as a suddenly committed teacher (its amusing to watch the class reaction to the change as well). Thomas Lennon is dependably funny as an official with the answers to the tests and whom Elizabeth of course must dupe. Any scene with John Michael Higgins as the put-upon principal with a thing for dolphins or Phyllis Smith as an uptight teacher is welcome. But in the end it just doesnt quite add up. Maybe its the too-easy ending that feels like a cop-out. Maybe its the cardboard cut-out nature of the characters. Probably its a combination of those and other elements that leads to Diazs bad teacher not being as bad as she might have been and ""Bad Teacher"" not as good as it could have been.

A lot of adolescent males may turn out opening weekend in the hope of seeing Cameron Diaz stoke their hot-for-teacher fantasies. But that -- sorry dudes -- is not what the movies about. Make no mistake Diazs Elizabeth Halsey is bad -- shes a heartless coarsely self-centered and manipulative schemer. The only reason shes a teacher at John Adams Middle School is because her fiance dumped her for being a gold digger and she needs to support herself. Her one goal in life is to land 10000 for breast-enhancement surgery. To get through the day she babysits her seventh graders by showing teacher movies like Stand and Deliver; she smokes dope and lies through her overbright red lipstick; she makes racial slurs (""This is why the Japs are overtaking us"" she exclaims reading her students papers); and she flirts like a paid escort with the sexy-nerd substitute Mr. Delacorte (Justin Timberlake) -- but only because hes the heir to a watch-company fortune. The basic joke of Bad Teacher which director Jake Kasdan hits over and over again is that Elizabeth is the most dislikable character of the year. Diaz in smeary make-up certainly makes her ill-tempered shrillness convincing but there isnt much spark to her performance and theres so little bounce -- or real shock -- to the films overly controlled look how rude were being black comedy that the audience is left stranded. Were not on Elizabeths side or anyone elses really. Were just watching a film try to pass off misanthropic blunt-wittedness as ""edge."" Kasdan thinks in outdated music-video shorthand trotting out Diaz in Daisy Dukes for a ""horny"" car-wash scene and getting his actors to pelt each other with invective. Timberlake has enough campy sincerity to make you wish hed been allowed a different note and Jason Segel as a romantic phys-ed instructor lays on the puppy-dog sweetness. The one actor I enjoyed was Lucy Punch as Elizabeths nice-teacher enemy. Bearing a physical resemblance to Lady Gaga (though more angelic and less outlandish) she turns this Goody Two-Shoes into the worlds most self-actualized Valley Girl. Even when shes insufferable you like her. Thats a trick the movie could have used more of.

Yay right?If a new era is dawning Bad Teacher reminds us exactly why change is so desperately needed. Directed by Jake Kasdan (an Apatow comedy family cousin whose last film was Walk Hard The Dewey Cox Story) and scripted by frequent Office writers Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky Bad Teacher focuses on a school year in the life of Elizabeth (Cameron Diaz) an aging party girl once destined to be a trophy wife who instead ended up an incompetent middle school English teacher managing to hold on to her job only via coy manipulation. Dumped by one wealthy fiance Elizabeth goes looking for another and finds potential in Scott (Justin Timberlake) an heir who has altruistically signed up as a substitute teacher. Elizabeth must compete for Scotts affections with her perky perfectionist white swan--history teacher Amy (Lucy Punch)--while first fending off and then (surprise) slowly succumbing to the advances of schlubby gym teacher Russell (Jason Segel).The general argument holds that because studios produce so few films built around strong lady protagonists Hollywood must hate women. But be careful what you wish for. Here a ""strong woman"" means a lazy lying scheming slutty and obstinately materialistic one whose sole redeeming virtue is her hard body (which the camera shamelessly ogles as if the men watching need their hand held to look at an actresss ass) who is so delusional that she thinks her ostentatious assholery is rock-star sexy and whose delusions are essentially validated by narrative resolution.At least Bad Teacher offers opportunities to ponder an evergreen pop-culture conundrum At what point do professional performers with evident talent and a proven ability to make smart choices realize theyre trapped in a film that--due to lazy writing style-free direction and visual design and a general refusal to aim above the lowest common denominator--simply cant be good? What compels someone like Justin Timberlake--so charismatically contemptible in The Social Network so often a saving grace on SNL--to take a role centered on a cringe-worthy set-piece involving him dry-humping his real-life ex-girlfriend? Are actresses like Diaz and Punch really cool with punishing material based on the worst male-invented stereotypes of the way women deceptively control men and compete with one another? If theyre at all conscious of what theyve gotten into did they try to make it better or did they submit to mediocrity because you know fuck it--the check cleared? Are they so far inside that they cant possibly gauge what the fix theyre in might look like from the outside?Jason Segel can perhaps He seems to have shown up on set carrying an enormous amount of weight as if hes hoping to not be recognized. In a role hardly larger than a cameo despite the fact that hes ostensibly the male romantic lead Segel never tries to hide that hes only here to pay his mortgage--which makes him the most likeable presence on-screen. In just a handful of scenes he comes close to saving the movie by injecting a much-needed dose of casual naturalistic performance into the shtick even as most of his dialogue consists of caustic asides and barbed flirting. Elizabeths sole character growth comes from her gradual understanding that she and Russell are soul mates of sorts in that theyve both figured out that sincerity is for suckers and thus subsequently live to mess with people. That his agitation consists entirely of harmlessly sour even charming verbal play directed at oblivious rubes while she gets her kicks from mounting pranks with severe real-world consequences is a moral discrepancy the film is content to leave unresolved.You cant say Bad Teacher doesnt fulfill the basic promise of its genre; once the dust settles boys and girls alike walk away with what they went looking for. But for Segels character ""victory"" doesnt seem like a good thing. Maybe this is a sign of progress after all After a hundred years worth of romances in which ""heroes"" are rewarded for their unrepentant shittiness with the affections of an ever-patient beloved maybe its the dudes turn to get the raw deal.

A foul-mouthed reprobate working in a traditionally wholesome profession with young people secretly plots to serve her own ends. Sound familiar? Although the two have no above-the-line credits in common ""Bad Teacher"" is essentially ""Bad Santa"" with a femme lead (Cameron Diaz) set in a middle school instead of a department-store grotto. Its also nowhere near as gleefully filthy or fun which would be OK if it had something more to offer like warmth or a sharper script. Nevertheless if played right canny scheduling could help raise pics GPA at the B.O. by attracting auds bored with f/x-driven summer fare. Sony pic has already been handicapped by negative early buzz prompted by a pushed-back release; it preemed in Blighty a week before it opens Stateside frequently the sign of a stinker. In fact the big surprise is that ""Teacher"" isnt a complete failure more like a C+/B- student that could have tried harder. Nevertheless its comic rhythms are out of whack and sloppy continuity and unfilled story blanks suggest ample post-production surgery on a pic that commenced shooting more than a year ago. The heroines questionable likability reps another risky variable. While fans of the salty scabrous humor that made the indie-lite laffer ""Bad Santa"" a cult favorite will consider ""Teacher"" sanitized and toothless by comparison but mainstream auds may be repulsed by the trash-talking gold-digging and all-around viperous Elizabeth Halsey (Diaz). Chalk it up to sexism but its harder to get auds to embrace a monstrous femme character than a man whos just as bad or worse. The filmmakers are clearly hoping to cash in on goodwill toward the usually charismatic Diaz but Jake Kasdans direction doesnt draw out her best allowing the actress to coast and mug her way through with a slackness that is at least in sync with her character. Diazs Elizabeth is a seventh-grade teacher in an Illinois suburb. Its never made clear why this blonde bombshell whose sole ambition is to marry a rich guy is working in public education in the first place -- in fact nothing about her backstory is made clear. But shes stuck there after getting dumped by her fiance (Nat Faxon) whose considerable wealth at least explains how Elizabeth happens to own so many Christian Louboutin shoes and designer dresses that mostly hem somewhere near the crotch. Elizabeths version of pedagogy is to put on a different education-themed DVD every day (""Stand and Deliver"" ""Dangerous Minds"") while she literally puts her feet up and schemes about how to raise money for breast-augmentation surgery. She thinks she needs a boob job to pull in dishy-but-dim supply teacher Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake just OK) who comes from a moneyed background. Idealistic Scott is actually better suited to terminally chipper passive-aggressive fellow teacher Amy Squirrel (a scene-stealing Lucy Punch) while Elizabeth clearly has more in common with gym teacher Russell Gettis (Jason Segel) who at least shares her taste in sarcasm and pot smoking. Its pretty obvious which way the chips will fall romantically by the end so the only suspense here is in seeing how bad Elizabeth will be. The answer is not very. Apart from partying cursing like a sailor being brutally honest with her students about their inadequacies committing a little light embezzlement and fraud and trying to steal Scott from Amy shes actually more not-so-bad-once-you-get-to-know-her teacher. As if in an attempt to portray Elizabeth as worse than she is the other thesps are made to look as manically squeaky-clean as possible though the script by Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg (""Ghostbusters III"") lacks the surreal quality that would make the material appealing to a proper stoner crowd. At its best the pics study of low-stakes workplace politics recalls Stupnitsky and Eisenbergs contributions to NBCs The Office"" especially when making smug people look stupid. (Timberlakes Scott gets one of the pics biggest laughs when he explains that he and Amy went to an Ethiopian restaurant ""They finally got their own cuisine Its progress"") Whats singularly lacking here is any sense of how to use the underage characters who apart from one or two are a barely distinguishable gaggle. If the filmmakers were aiming to make the film more marketable they might have considered using ""School of Rock"" rather than ""Bad Santa"" as a template. Craft contributions are standard but undistinguished. Apart from school field trip to what is supposed to be Abraham Lincolns home in Springfield Ill. virtually no effort is made to create the illusion that the pic was shot anywhere other than California. Connoisseurs of poor continuity will be delighted with the climactic romantic scene in which its patently obvious the stand-in hired to replace Diaz in a shot-reverse-shot conversation with Segel was actually half a foot shorter than the real actress.

TWITTER Justin Timberlake and Cameron Diaz star in Jake Kasdans raunchy comedy. NEW YORK -- Positioning itself as the academic answer to Bad Santa Jake Kasdans Bad Teacher threatens a schoolyard tussle but refuses to hit below the belt. Screenwriters Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg dish up shameless misbehavior but never approach the depravity of the earlier film -- probably a smart choice for the movies box office prospects which are solid but one that places a certain tier of shock-hilarity out of reach. Cameron Diaz comes to the picture ready to offend. Her eyes have never been harder and on the rare occasion that the script offers her a line like ""Im gonna suck your dick like Im mad at it"" she spits it out convincingly. But for all her desk-stashed booze and inappropriately tight skirts the movie offers Diaz a pretty bland badness. She plays Elizabeth Halsey a teacher desperate to land a rich husband and quit her job; having decided that a fresh pair of breasts would help with that she embarks on a series of petty moneymaking schemes to buy implants. She cajoles parents into paying her for ""private tutoring"" pawns the contents of the lost amp; found and embezzles from a fundraising car wash made vastly more successful when she uses her cutoff-clad body as a chamois. (In a millisecond-long cameo one gawking dad at the carwash is played by Kasdans old collaborator Paul Feig whose Bridesmaids stole Bad Teachers raunchy-women thunder a few weeks ago.) Justin Timberlake is amusingly ingenuous as the wealthy but dimwitted newcomer Elizabeth hopes to seduce though (with the exception of one bizarre dry-humping gag) the movie doesnt exploit his capacity for self-mockery as well as Saturday Night Live sometimes has. The purposeful tortoise to Timberlakes peppy hare Jason Segel steals scenes as the gym teacher who keeps flirting despite Elizabeths many rejections. The pictures most entertainingly unhinged element though is Lucy Punch whose overachieving social studies teacher seethes with a goody-goody neurosis that threatens to erupt as she watches her colleague get ahead despite treating students like animals. Happily showing more restraint than she did as the lustful stalker in Dinner for Schmucks Punch makes a highlight out of what could have been a tiresome role. Concocting the inevitable redemption for a character as intentionally unsympathetic as Elizabeth is a challenge and the script doesnt quite rise to it. It points in the right direction during a field-trip scene where her contempt for a students romantic cluelessness convincingly motivates an act of kindness. But there are a couple of steps missing between that moment and the relative maturity with which Elizabeth eventually weighs the contest between the milquetoast millionaire and Segels earthy schlub. Barely an hour and a half long the film could have spared a few minutes to sell her turnaround (such as it is). Having decided not to risk offending us it could at least work a little harder to earn our affection.

Cameron Diaz is Elizabeth a dirty-mouthed hard-drinking pot-smoking Chicago teacher who cares more about raising cash for a boob job than passing on knowledge to her charges. A break-up with a fiance keeps her unhappily in the education system where she has both eyes on a wealthy colleague Scott (Justin Timberlake) although hes more keen on overachieving Amy (Lucy Punch). Meanwhile the nice-guy sports coach (Jason Segel) holds a flame for Elizabeth... Its a basic but amusing farce gifted with enough sharp lines to carry you through the lean patches. I love helping bums says Elizabeth her character straight from the Bad Santa school of writing - a shit you can love - although this films political incorrectness is far more self-conscious and coy. Diaz relishes the role compared to the dire Knight and Day this is her Citizen Kane.

Cameron Diaz was good but her character was anything but likable - which really ruined it for me - I literally couldnt care less if she ended up with Timberlake or the other guy or got the money or didnt. I saw this because Im a fan of Lucy Punch - but it was the worst thing Ive seen her in (apart from that sitcom). She was wasted in it. It was also full of really clunky humour. You had a brief smile at some of it but then it laboured and laboured the jokes as if the film-makers expected you to still be laughing five minutes later. But I wasnt.
