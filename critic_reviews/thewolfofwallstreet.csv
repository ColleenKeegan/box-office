"A-oooh << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com  Previous San Diegos Long Strange Trip  Next Deconstructing Gaffney Paramount Pictures Facebook Twitter Print Art A-oooh Martin Scorseses (amazing) The Wolf of Wall Street and the best Leonardo DiCaprio has ever been by Wesley Morris on December 30 2013 Its rare that a tracking shot brings a tear to my eye. But theres one in The Wolf of Wall Street that almost made me weep. Investment banker Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) stands before the scores of bankers of his scammy Stratton Oakmont brokerage and cajoles them into telling their clients to buy stock in the shoe company Steve Madden (its the early 1990s). Belfort finishes his speech by simulating the swing and smack of a baseball. When the imaginary ball flies the camera sails with it. It soars over the rows and rows of desks as men and women scream into their phones because their young coked-up commander -- who illegally owns a huge share of the company -- has coked them up too. Who knows why this image got to me? It could be that just as the camera does its thing the live sound drops out and Jimmy Castors ""Hey Leroy Your Mama Callin You"" starts to play. That song is an even better city-playground record than ""Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard"" and it gives ironic funk and Latin soul to whats effectively a spirit-bilking exercise. It could be the controlled chaos of it all. But this whole movie is like that imaginary baseball hit right out of the park. The opportunity to say or do something about the predations of the banking industry would push a lot of directors into righteousness and solemnity. Maybe it should. But Martin Scorsese turns national tragedy into farce and rarely in a way that feels itself distasteful. For three hours the movie operates at a ridiculous comedic pitch. You never forget youre at the circus. You never lose site of the lawlessness the reckless pleasure the sheer lunacy and lack of regulation. Scorsese hurls the madness at you like a pie in the face.

The Year of the Movie Apocalypse Is the end nigh for Hollywood? Do You Like Prince Movies? Podcast Alex Pappademas and Wesley Morris discuss Beyonce American Hustle and R. Kelly. Youre wiping off cream starting from the opening couple of montages which are narrated by DiCaprio. The movie is taken from The Wolf of Wall Street Belforts real-life first memoir (there are two) and the screenwriter Terence Winter seizes on the books braggy ""can you top this?"" tone. Belfort imagined the book to be contrite. But mostly it reads like a long-form hip-hop record. Winter locates the decadence in the self-aggrandizement and turns it up. A minute after the movies begun one of Jordans sports cars whizzes by; in the narration he declares the cars color is wrong and it changes on the spot. This is a self-impressed variation on the offscreen guiding Ray Liotta did as Henry Hill in Scorseses Goodfellas. Its not narration. Its a dramatic reading. The movies are basically twins two accounts of young men exhilarated by sex drugs money and crime. Goodfellas was stressful. The cocaine in that movie kept everybody from looking down at the life-or-death tightrope they walked. The random violence the probability of being caught the mistakes the mistresses the paranoia Only a psychopath -- or an idiot -- could leave that movie wanting to join the mob. The Wolf of Wall Street is full of idiot psychos but theyve come to party. After Belforts over-the-top self-introduction the movie steps back to show his arrival on Wall Street as a twentysomething kitten from middle-class Long Island. He gets a thankless job at a brokerage run by a tanned rooster with an upside-down bouffant named Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey). One day Hanna takes Belfort to lunch (hes impressed that the kid pitched a stock during his interview) and proceeds to walk him through the looking glass. Hanna explains the con (move the money from the clients pocket to yours) and the lifestyle (the only way to do the job is high). Of course theres an outsize nuttiness to the way McConaughey presents the tutorial. He beats his chest while humming until the beating and humming become the sort of tribal song I imagine cavemen would perform upon returning home with their spoils from the hunt. The scene which McConaughey shoots through with a kooky arrogance is a marvel of satirical blatancy. He has three scenes and is gone. Hannas firm goes under in the Black Monday market crash of 1987. Belfort contemplates getting out of finance. No ones hiring brokers. But his somewhat-demure wife -- his first one played by a very good Cristin Milioti -- sees an ad for a broker and he shows up in a nice suit at a Long Island strip mall. The office is shabby and the men schlubby. Spike Jonze plays the broker who sits near the door and explains to Belfort how this place works. They sell cheap stocks to working-class people at a 50 percent commission. Thats 49 percent more than Belfort was making with Hanna. And the jolly innocence with which Jonze lays out the operation makes it sound as if hes selling a spot in the Peace Corps. Soon enough the schlubs crown Belfort king and he strikes out and trains a handful of nincompoops including a weirdo WASPy Jew named Donnie (Jonah Hill) to start Stratton Oakmont. Belfort wants to bilk the 1 percent compete with the big Wall Street outfits and rake in the dough. By that score things are a raging success. In flows the money call girls and drugs (cocaine Quaaludes speed). A money-laundering operation is established and Belforts confidence hits outer space. Jordan comes on to his future ex-wife a smooth blonde model from Bay Ridge Brooklyn (Margot Robbie) pretty much in front of his current one. Money is balled up and tossed in trash cans. He has sex with the second Mrs. Belfort on stacks of it. Orgies trash hotels jets and the Stratton Oakmont offices. But during the many years that pass in this film Belfort and his crew are able to wake up and keep bilking every day. It looks easy fun and primed to go up in smoke at any moment. (Kyle Chandler is the FBI agent on the firms case.) Scorsese has made a fun movie but that fun resides in the recognition that were watching goons in bespoke suits. In one scene the Stratton Oakmont offices throw a party that begins with a barely dressed male marching band. Then strippers pour in like Visigoth invaders. All kinds of screaming and fucking and gladiating commence and in the middle of that chaos is an employee who agreed to let her head be shaved for 10000. ""Scalp Scalp Scalp"" She wanders into the shenanigans with her cash and nasty haircut in ecstasy and shock. Whoever started shaving her never bothered to finish. The profligacy feels like the end of the world. Its Apocalypse Now in Lower Manhattan. On the one hand what the banking industry has done to this country is no laughing matter. The myriad scandals and the men who perpetrated them (its never women) have inspired the high-minded hand-wringing of Oliver Stones Wall Street and the outraged horror show of Charles Fergusons Inside Job. There have been films and TV shows as different as Boiler Room Margin Call Arbitrage Damages and Woody Allens Blue Jasmine in which a womans Madoff-like husband ruins her familys life. These are mostly heavy movies even Allens. On the other hand theres a certain audacity in throwing comedy at the problem. But its all visual comedy the opulence of such ugly luded-out people in slow motion the aerial shots of the mornings after all the fuckfests that give the impression that a massacre occurred. The sustained juxtaposition of glam rock combat and Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous gets you high while also making you sad and kind of sick. You laugh at Scorseses treatment of how Belfort and his buddies treated money people and the law. After one narrated montage ends with a shot of a broker dead in his bathtub DiCaprio leaves a beat and sighs ""Anyway."" This isnt Goodfellas. Its more debauched and de-romanticized. The bankers are gangsters but theyre also terrorists -- ""telephone terrorists"" yells Belfort -- beating their chests and groaning in their big high-rent caves. And Robbie whos from Australia isnt bad. Shes committed to the chintz of the part. But its like watching someone aim for Lorraine Bracco in Goodfellas and Sharon Stone in Casino but land at Real Housewives. Otherwise the rhythm of this movie has a hook in both the extended sequences and the shorter more kaleidoscopic ones. Working with a crew that includes his longtime editor Thelma Schoonmaker the cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto and Robbie Robertson supervising the soundtrack Scorsese returns to New York and finds a new operatic gear. This is actually the closest to Fellinis vulgarity that Scorsese has ever come. Hes playing with new tricks. Theres some telepathic table tennis that goes on between Belfort and an elegant Swiss banker played by a silky Jean Dujardin (from The Artist). Theres even dancing to Naughty by Nature on the front of Belforts super yacht and a stormy shipwreck scene. Theres also a sequence featuring Quaaludes and driving that is one of the funniest things Ive ever seen. Then theres DiCaprio who is like a desperate cartoon. He and Scorsese have done strong stuff together -- The Aviator The Departed Shutter Island. Those movies had greatness in them but this has something altogether different. Its free of the self-consciousness that has marked their previous movies even a work of gutter art like The Departed. Belfort is the best work DiCaprio has ever done in no small part because hes not begging us to like him. DiCaprio gets to let go physically and emotionally. Hes rarely asked to be unapologetically funny. But he and Scorsese have developed a trust. DiCaprio is free to play an asshole like Belfort and do the best work he has ever done in no small part because hes not begging us to like him. That neediness in DiCaprio has always been a limitation. He likes parts with a clear psychological explanation for what hes playing. This time hes playing greed and the hedonism and extravagance set him free. (To see him dance some type of robot dance to Bo Diddley at a wedding reception is essentially to die and go to cheeseball-disco heaven.) There are three or four scenes in which DiCaprio has to use a microphone to address the staff and he gives those a rock n roll televangelist charge. He loves the crowds in this movie. He seems to love the scenes with Hill whose character is even more unstable than Belfort and with the rest of the massive cast (Rob Reiner Joanna Lumley Jon Bernthal Kenneth Choi P.J. Byrne Bo Dietl as himself). One of those speeches is supposed to be a resignation speech but he turns it into a steroidal James Brown routine. He contorts his face and body for this role. He turns into James Cagney Jack Nicholson Liotta and Dick Van Dyke. You sense this is what Scorsese has been trying to do for DiCaprio all these years unleash him. You also sense that is what Scorsese has been hoping to get out of working with a younger star youth. But The Wolf of Wall Street is not just a young movie. Scorseses 71. Hes been around long enough to see what that one neighborhood of this city he loves has done to this country and to the world. Scorsese sometimes runs only as deep as his screenplays. And Winters is a good one. It is not deeply political but it doesnt need to be. Scorsese laces his amusement with just enough anger. In another dozen or so years these guys could have been running the Capitol in The Hunger Games. Belfort served 22 months of a four-year sentence and is now giving speeches and doing sales training. Half of every dollar he makes is supposed to reimburse his victims. He makes a brief appearance at the end. Hes reformed he says. But its hard to watch Scorseses movie and not think more about the ruin he wrought and about all the other Belforts who are still very much employed. Of course the Bible is notoriously open to interpretation too. One mans Eden is anothers Gomorrah. An earlier version of this column misstated Margot Robbies characters origin as Bayside Brooklyn; this has been corrected to Bay Ridge Brooklyn.

Martin Scorseses new film based on the autobiography of Jordan Belfort a broker who made a fortune on shady sales of penny stocks--and spent a fortune on drugs sex and other self-indulgences--in the nineties before going to jail for his financial crimes is an exuberant hyper-energized riot. Its like mainlining cinema for three hours and I wouldnt have wanted it a minute shorter. The jangled story line sticks close to Belforts perspective; his voice guides the action and Scorseses freewheeling direction captures the autobiographers raunchy discursive vigor. Scorsese unleashes a furious yet exquisitely controlled kinetic energy complete with a plunging and soaring camera mercurial and conspicuous special effects counterfactual scenes subjective fantasies and swirling choreography on a grand scale. He also introduces a great device to impose the protagonists point of view Belfort narrates the action even while hes in the midst of living it addressing the camera with monologues that show him to be both inside and outside the events converging on-screen his present and former selves. Its furious cinematic inventions are no mere flourishes; theyre essential to Scorseses vision of Belforts story and to the disturbing moral ideas that he extracts from it. ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" may be Scorseses most fully realized movie with its elaboration of a world view that without endorsing Belforts predatory manipulations and reckless adventures acknowledges the essential vitality at their core. The movie has a sharply rhythmic swing like a great jazz band in flat-out rumble thanks to Scorseses stylistic inventiveness and the wild exhilarating performances that he elicits from his cast. Leonardo DiCaprio playing Belfort gives the first fully satisfying elbows-out uninhibited screen performance that Ive seen from him. (DiCaprio is thirty-nine but I intend no insult here--Humphrey Bogart didnt come fully into his own until after forty.) DiCaprio has always been an extraordinarily gifted mimic but his performances have been burdened with a second layer of mimicry--he has to play a star as well as his role. In ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" he leaves impersonation behind and unleashes spontaneous bursts of energy that seem to tear through the screen. Instead of fitting his performance to a preconception of Belfort DiCaprio seems to be improvising on the theme of Belfort spinning out an electric repertory of gestures and inflections. By being more than ever himself on-screen DiCaprio realizes his role more deeply than ever before. More or less the entire cast could fill the lists of nominees for supporting actors especially Jonah Hill as Donnie Azoff Belforts partner in business pleasure and crime; Rob Reiner as Belforts father Max called Mad Max for his exotic temper; Margot Robbie as Naomi Lapaglia Belforts first mistress then second wife (her consonants alone floating away at the end of words deserve an Oscar); and Matthew McConaughey in a brief but high-relief role as a swaggering Wall Street mentor that tunes the movie like a concertmaster. Scorsese has done more than just put together a finely meshed ensemble; he brings together flamboyant soloists who combine emotional inspiration with emblematic physical and vocal specificity. Reiners first appearance in the film is the funniest scene Ive seen in a movie for quite some time and my second and third runners-up are also in this film. For all its frank and confessional presentation of financial crimes and destructive pleasures ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is an outrageous comedy that in its greatest moments is inspired by the howling uproars of Jerry Lewis and Jackie Gleason. Scorsese makes Belforts life look as jazzed and as swinging as Belfort must have felt it was. Brilliantly Scorsese doesnt hide the story behind the story--he makes the planning of a repellently decadent party even more absorbing than the event itself and somehow manages to make a self-administered enema seem like part of the fun. Belfort is furiously appetitive idiosyncratically gifted and perceptively opportunistic; he doesnt so much turn to the dark side as stumble into it and just keep going. His story is one of sex drugs and rock and roll but with financial machinations replacing the music. Belfort turns out to be a savant of sales a complex art of rhetoric performance and psychology combined with boundless chutzpah. He takes pleasure in the money that he moves from his clients pockets to his own but he also takes pleasure from the very exercise of power over his victims. He isnt Gordon Gekko who engineers his greed into a social good as if rendering himself a disinterested servant of abstract principle; Belfort loves what he does. Its thrilling for Jordan Belfort to use and abuse this power and its thrilling for us to watch--and his understanding that his actions are wrong only adds to the thrill. Belforts misadventures are driven by his desire for a wilder experience a greater pleasure a higher high a more shattering ecstasy--an extreme of sensation joining pleasure and pain (one of the movies most telling scenes involves a session with a dominatrix). He has not just a self-defeating intelligence but a self-punishing one. It took a sort of genius to conceive Belforts plan talent to realize it and stupidity to think he could get away with it. The smarts and the stupidity dont coexist side by side; they overlap. The risk is part of the pleasure the anticipation of the fall is part of the thrill the humiliation and degradation is built into the excitement of his success. For all of his crudeness vulgarity and cruelty hes one of the high-wire elite akin to those actors and directors those musicians and writers those monstrous potentates whose vast and dark range of experience is precisely the source of their allure. Its cold comfort to Belforts victims--and a hard challenge to critics like me whose idea of great adventure involves a night at the opera and a good book. Scorsese without at all seeking to justify explain or apologize for Belforts actions reveals the impulse behind the vulgar self-indulgence and the grotesque insensitivity the terrifying yet ecstatic inner force within the petty monster of vanity. The already celebrated expressionistic comedy of Belforts quaalude-spastic night crawl to his Lamborghini is matched by the crazed crowd-stoking as he addresses his employees before taking leave of his firm. The speech runs the gamut from a frenzied sentimental intimacy (Id bet that some viewers wont be able to resist some embarrassing tears) to a shattering outburst. (Who would have expected DiCaprio to reveal himself to be a comedian of such a high order?) What makes the movie a comedy is that after all that Belfort went through all that he put others through all that he may have come to regret--having done enough to have a past--he survived it and having survived it his memories take on a wry tone of wonder that such things could ever have happened even to himself. Yet within the comedy Scorseses vision is a tragic one rooted in the stark wisdom of Belforts division of the world into those who unendowed with such a gift a hunger and a will are relegated to lives of frustration and narrowness; and those who thus endowed seek to fulfill their unfulfillable cravings by taking advantage of the former. Scorsese also suggests a third category--the sort of person embodied by the F.B.I. agent (played with a cagy dialectical bonhomie by Kyle Chandler) and the prosecuting attorneys who bring down Belfort. Despite the authentic justice of their work these people of principle are no saints. As Scorsese shows they bind themselves in a carapace of order and discipline that allows them too to take visceral pleasure in the exercise of power. No of course Scorsese doesnt approve of Belforts actions; who would? We may wish that such behavior didnt exist but its existence is a central part of human nature and theres a reason that we cant stop watching just as we cant stop watching the terrifying storm or the shark attack. Within the movies roiling riotous turbulence is an Olympian detachment a grand and cold consideration of life from a contemplative distance as revealed in the movies last shot which puts ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" squarely in the realm of the late film with its lofty vision of ultimate things. Its as pure and harrowing a last shot as those of John Fords ""7 Women"" and Carl Theodor Dreyers ""Gertrud""--an image that if by some terrible misfortune were to be Scorseses last would rank among the most harshly awe-inspiring farewells of the cinema.

Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size Christopher Orr Dec 25 2013 Culture ParamountLets be clear from the outset The Wolf of Wall Street is not a ""scathing indictment of capitalism run amok"" or a ""cautionary fable for our time"" or any of the comparable high-minded plaudits that are likely to be thrown its way. Yes Martin Scorseses new feature is undeniably topical the story of a rogue Wall Street trader Jordan Belfort who made himself and his partners fabulously wealthy at the expense of the broader American public and got off--even after multiple fraud convictions--nearly scot-free. But the film displays almost no interest whatsoever in Belforts victims and it is extravagantly incurious regarding the mechanisms by which he took their money. If this is a message movie its one that features a message suitable for a cue card.None of which incidentally is intended as an indictment. The Wolf of Wall Street is a magnificent black comedy fast funny and remarkably filthy. Like a Bad Santa Scorsese has offered up for the holidays a truly wicked display of cinematic showmanship--one that also happens to be among his best pictures of the last 20 years.Related Story American Hustles Stylish Lies Based on the memoirs of the real-life Belfort the story follows his meteoric rise from a penny-stock broker operating out of a strip mall in the late 1980s to a twentysomething tycoon complete with mansions a lingerie-model wife a yacht nearly the size of the QE2 a helicopter and two bodyguards--""both of them named Rocco."" Oh and drugs and hookers. Lots of drugs and hookers. The latter he estimates he frolicked with five or six times a week on average. The former included Quaaludes Adderall Xanax pot cocaine (of course) and morphine ""because its awesome.""Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Belfort narrating his own tale with the help of frequent demolitions of the fourth wall. (""No no no. My Ferrari was white--like Don Johnsons in Miami Vice--not red."") As a Wall Street newbie he absorbs wisdom from an older broker-guru (Matthew McConaughey in a magnificent but all-too-small role) who offers invaluable lessons about money coke and masturbation (""When you get really good at it youll be stroking and thinking about money""). Soon enough Belfort is in turn imparting such wisdom to his own acolytes (including a very good--and very funny--Jonah Hill) and the brokerage firm Stratton Oakmont is born.This may be the highest-velocity three-hour movie ever a delirious and borderline addictive wash of adrenaline testosterone and controlled substances.Stratton Oakmont is essentially a white-shoe criminal enterprise that fleeces its clients by day and throws sex-booze-and-drug-suffused ""motivational"" exercises by night--and for that matter by day too. (Eventually these activities require the posting of a sign in the office declaring ""No fucking in the bathroom between 9 and 7."" It is of course ignored.) These and related depravities continue for about two and a half hours of the movies running time with a few close calls from the SEC and FBI along the way until the final act when the tone turns darker and Belfort finally gets his astonishingly belated (and decidedly insufficient) comeuppance.Yes The Wolf of Wall Street is a solid three hours long--an earlier cut ran to three-and-a-half--and it would be a better film if it were shorter. But its easy to see why Scorsese was loath to cut further than he did. This may be the highest-velocity three-hour movie Ive ever seen a delirious and borderline addictive wash of adrenaline testosterone and controlled substances.The screenplay by Terence Winter (Boardwalk Empire) is a marvel of indecency featuring hilarious set pieces regarding cousin marriage Quaaludes and the various grades of prostitute. DiCaprio is a mesmerizingly over-the-top slice of ham--part motivational speaker (think Tom Cruise in Magnolia) part football coach (think Al Pacino in Any Given Sunday) and all sleaze. The supporting cast which also features Jean Dujardin and Kyle Chandler is uniformly terrific. Even Rob Reiner (who plays Belforts dad) delivers big-screen excellence for the first time on either side of the camera in longer than I care to remember.The true star is Martin Scorsese who at age 71 comes explosively uncorked like a well-shaken bottle of vintage champagne.But the true star of The Wolf of Wall Street is Martin Charles Scorsese who at age 71 comes uncorked like a well-shaken bottle of vintage champagne. The movie plays like a masters course in cinematic technique delivered by the master himself crammed with giddy effects and visual jokes. A crowd parts for DiCaprio as it did in Titanic and there is a brilliantly naughty variation on the epochal ""Mrs. Robinson youre trying to seduce me"" shot from The Graduate. There are witty references too to The Equalizer Tod Brownings Freaks and Benihana. And dont get me started on the comic tour de force in which Popeyes spinach is analogized to--no youll have to wait and see it for yourself.From the first-person narration to the exquisitely clever soundtrack to the overall rags-to-riches-to-indictment story arc The Wolf of Wall Street is clearly intended to be the prodigal son (and yes it is definitely a boy) of Scorseses Goodfellas. Belfort claws his working-class way into a manicured life creates his own (non-homicidal) mini-mob family of criminal loyalists and is ultimately undone by his appetites and vanity. Does Wolf have the heft or depth of Goodfellas? Of course not. The stakes are lower the tone breezier the excesses vastly more excessive. But you know what they say second time farce.The Wolf of Wall Street is not a subtle movie or a thoughtful movie or a particularly innovative movie. But for those susceptible to its vulgar charms Scorseses latest is a great--no a fucking great--movie movie.

Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip.

"Review Scorsese DiCaprio go hunting in Wolf of Wall Street - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Scorsese DiCaprio go hunting in Wolf of Wall Street A wealthy stockbroker finds himself living the high life until corruption and crime get in the way of his fun. (By Christy Khoshaba) Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Think you already hate those Wall Street high rollers who took so many investors for a ride in the 90s?Just wait until Martin Scorsese Leonardo DiCaprio and ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" are through with you. Man does this movie have a savage bite.Yet it is such a kick to watch the filmmaker and the star in their fifth collaboration. They go at the black-hearted comedy full throttle fully tanked and for DiCaprio full monty -- almost. PHOTOS Behind the scenes of movies and TVThe script by Terence Winter stays close to Jordan Belforts audacious 2007 memoir of his highly leveraged life. Scorsese adopts the former stockbrokers irreverent tone then amps it up so that the film fairly crackles with electricity from beginning to end. A very fast three hours ""Wolf"" is a fascinating revolting outlandish uproarious exhilarating and exhausting master work on immorality.DiCaprio plays Belfort the so-called ""wolf"" a young Turk who rode the market to unbelievable riches -- 49 million the year he turned 26. Most of it was spent on cocaine Quaaludes hookers a helicopter and other expensive toys. Basically anything money could buy -- Belfort did -- unapologetically.The actor is just as unapologetic. Fierce and in your face DiCaprios performance turns Belfort into the human incarnation of avarice and arrogance. This is not a likable man. But as DiCaprio increasingly proves he is great at playing the irredeemable. I guess the wolf is not quite as bad as the sadistic Southern slaver he brought to merciless life in ""Django Unchained"" last year. But the performance is somehow more provocative in the way it traffics in modern-day sins. PHOTOS Best films of 2013 | Betsy SharkeyFor Belfort life begins the day he finally has his brokers license in hand. Hes been well trained to go rogue at the venerable L.F. Rothschild under the watchful bloodshot eyes of a cocaine-and-martini-fueled hot shot named Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey).It is Oct. 19 1987 dubbed Black Monday the stock market crash heard round the world. The Dow dropped 508 points that day. After nearly 90 years Rothschild collapsed in the wake of it putting Belfort and many like him out of a job.Belfort eventually builds his fortune as a bottom-feeder -- progressing from penny stocks to blue chips and IPOs. Taking shoe designer Steve Maddens company public becomes both a joke and an immorality clause in the film. So extraordinary are Belforts gains the FBI and the SEC begin investigating. A little cooperation at the right time and a refashioned wolf is back on the street. Not Wall Street -- hes banned -- but Belforts still got game.The question of how an earnest Wall Street trainee one who refused lunchtime martinis became a soulless millionaire driven by an insatiable desire for money drugs and sex is answered. The why is not.PHOTOS Best films of 2013 | Kenneth TuranBut first Scorsese wants to introduce ""debauchery"" as defined by Belfort taking us deep inside his den of iniquity Stratton Oakmont the Long Island brokerage he founded with Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill) a fictionalized character based on his former partner.Our tour guide is Belfort himself. As the book did so well a good deal of the dialogue is directed toward us. Dripping with a kind of toxic charisma Belfort wants to confess all. DiCaprios skill at playing to the camera makes this descent into hell irresistible.The film begins with a polished ad for Stratton a lion roaming the brokerage as a narrator talks about tradition. Then the scene shifts to a dwarf-throwing competition in that same Stratton boardroom -- a football-field-sized floor filled with desks and feverish Belfort acolytes.You see in the way Belfort urges on his troops microphone in hand voice building in intensity the motivational speaker he will eventually become after his crimes ban him from the financial game.FULL COVERAGE Oscars 2014Of course the wolf never asks for anything he wouldnt do himself. So hes right in there tossing a dwarf then leading the charge though the night -- memorably snorting a line of strategically placed coke off a hookers derriere -- before facing the wrath of the ""Duchess of Bay Ridge"" the next morning. His second wife a blond bombshell named Naomi (Margot Robbie) is her own piece of work. Sex -- or withholding it -- her weapon of choice. Robbie definitely gets into the bump and grind of it.This is a big sprawling story that involves the actual fleecing of the unsuspecting along with hard partying Swiss bank accounts wiretaps bribery more hard partying money laundering and weirdly friendship and family.The casting is spot-on across the board but Hill is a standout as the despicable Donnie. Between his overly white teeth his sexual proclivities and his disdain for most of humanity Donnie is actually worse than the wolf and Hill hits a smarmy high. But the film would implode if it was just bad boys and bad behavior. ""The Artists"" Jean Dujardin as the Swiss banker eager to handle Belforts funds and the lunacy of his tendency to lapse into French at the most inopportune times is great comic relief. Rob Reiner as Belforts father ""Mad"" Max is priceless as the voice of reason. Belforts Javert is FBI agent Patrick Denham. Played with a clean-cut but sarcastic fervor by Kyle Chandler he provides the accountability and a few shreds of decency which the film definitely needed.Meanwhile the late 80s and early 90s have been polished to a flashy sheen. Rodrigo Prieto is the director of photography. Bob Shaws production design and Sandy Powells costuming are terrific. And the soundtrack under Randall Posters supervision is inspired. Or as the Cannonball Adderley track puts it so eloquently ""Mercy mercy mercy please."" There is none from Scorsese. It is his brashest most provocative work yet. There is a real verve to ""Wolf"" as if the movie somehow recharged the filmmaker. I wont say this is his best ever; ""The Departed"" still leads the pack. And Id argue the ending -- more a whimper than a bang -- is a weakness. But thats a minor complaint.As to whether redemption comes to the big bad wolf I think its safe to say the only change is in the style of his sheeps clothing.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com---The Wolf of Wall StreetMPAA rating R for sequences of strong sexual content graphic nudity drug use and language throughout and for some violence.Running time 2 hours 59 minutesPlaying In general release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Movies Leonardo DiCaprio Martin Scorsese Jonah Hill Reviews Margot Robbie SAG Awards 2014 Is The Wolf of Wall Street still lying in wait?

(Photo/Video Paramount Pictures) By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Updated Dec. 24 2013 142 p.m. ET More Markets How Investigators Untangled the Wolf Scandal In ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" Leonardo DiCaprio plays Jordan Belfort the celebrated crook of the 1990s who prided himself on his ability to sell anything and did in fact swindle investors out of hundreds of millions of dollars. Martin Scorseses epic-scale comedy of criminality adapted by Terence Winter from Mr. Belforts book of the same name is selling three hours of incessant shouting and sensationally bad behavior--mud wrestling without the mud that includes drugs booze debauchery degeneracy and dwarf-throwing. Its meant to be an entertaining even meaningful representation of the penny-stock maestros life and times. But I couldnt buy it and couldnt wait for the hollow spectacle to end. Thats no knock on Mr. DiCaprio who throws himself heart and soul into a character with deep deficits in both departments. Lets stipulate that his extravagant embodiment of excess is extremely skillful and very funny and put other stipulations on record as well. Jonah Hill equipped with phosphorescent teeth and a manic affect is often hilarious as Jordans partner in the sleazy firm of Stratton Oakmont. So is Matthew McConaughey in a madcap soliloquy on masturbation and the need to stay relaxed. The film does full justice to its denizens devotion to cocaine Quaaludes and heroin and to morphine which Jordan takes ""because its awesome."" The Scorsese touch is everywhere in evidence swirling set pieces (Stratton Oakmonts boiler room full of rabid brokers as a Roman bacchanal) spectacular camera moves (Rodrigo Prieto was the cinematographer) and all of it heightened and sharpened by Thelma Schoonmakers editing. Some of the settings are enjoyable up to a point for their tacky sumptuousness I liked the trashing of a Lamborghini Countach. And sharp-witted scenes do play out from time to time on a human scale. In one of them a couple of FBI agents engage the wily Jordan in a game of cat-and-rat. ENLARGE Leonardo DiCaprio plays Jordan Belfort. Paramount Pictures Eventually though the pandemonium wears you down; in my case eventually meant the end of the first hour with two more hours to go. ""Stratton Oakmont is America"" insists Jordan ever the overreacher in the course of his self-serving valedictory. Maybe so but any meaningful perspective on the greedfest of the period is obscured by the gleefulness of the depiction. The film may well prove profitable Lurid outlaws are always appealing and theres pleasure to be had in the downfall of slimeballs. But ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" demands a huge investment of time for a paltry return. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty Sometimes you see failed films and think well they tried for this or that but couldnt pull it off. After seeing Ben Stillers version of the venerable James Thurber story I dont know what the film was trying for. Its a cipher in every realm but the visual. (Stuart Dryburgh did the stylish cinematography.) ENLARGE Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller) imagines himself as a fearless mountain climber who captures the attention of his co-worker Cheryl (Kristen Wiig). 20th Century Fox Mr. Stiller isnt the first one of course to play Walter Mitty on screen. In 1947 eight years after the Thurber story appeared in The New Yorker magazine an elaborate MGM production starred Danny Kaye as the wistful daydreamer who imagines himself in heroic situations. The movie was overblown with a succession of preposterous adventures that grew tedious; its durable reputation is due to its star a great comic actor who did memorably well with Walters mood swings between mousy and manic. Mr. Stillers version written by Steve Conrad wisely moderates the derring-do but unwisely sends its hero on a quest that swings tentatively between the spiritual and the absurd. Even the starting point feels tentative. The time is the present but Walter works in the photo department of Life magazine which closed down as a standalone publication more than a decade ago. (He goes forth in search of a missing negative shot by a legendary photographer.) Walter does have outlandish adventures in the Himalayas Greenland and Iceland but the lines between his fantasies and reality keep getting blurred. You dont know for instance if hes imagining himself jumping from a chopper into arctic waters or really making the jump. Whether the blurring is intentional or accidental it vitiates a film that already feels dissociated as if the basic narrative structure hadnt been thought through. Impressive landscapes plus Kristen Wiigs appealing Cheryl the fellow worker who inflames Walters passion make the movie enjoyable enough. Yet its style is a constant bafflement and nowhere more so than in a key scene on a Himalayan mountaintop--an encounter between Walter and a character played by Sean Penn. One could imagine the scene being played relatively straight as a moment of fleeting profundity in a comedy or as the culmination of a shaggy-dog story. Whats so baffling is the way it has been played--drained of energy tone or discernible attitude. Like so much of this journey by a shy guy from Life magazine Walters peak experience is weirdly lifeless. August Osage County Family dysfunction has seldom been as flamboyant--or notable for its performances and flow of language--as it is in this screen version of the Tracy Letts play directed by John Wells from a screenplay by the playwright. The cast alone is worth the price of admission Meryl Streep as the cancer-riddled drug-addled matriarch Violet Weston; Sam Shepard as her alcoholic husband; Julia Roberts Julianne Nicholson and Juliette Lewis as the couples daughters; and Chris Cooper Ewan McGregor Margo Martindale Benedict Cumberbatch and Abigail Breslin as members of their extended family. The language rich in invective flows from kindred spirits who are rich in aggressiveness both the active and passive flavors. By comparison to this familial Grand Guignol ""Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" is a crash course in decorousness. Watch the trailer for ""August Osage County"" a new film based on the Pulitzer Prize winning play by Tracy Letts. Starring Meryl Streep Julia Roberts Ewan McGregor and more. When I saw the play on Broadway some years ago I had a good seat down front on the left yet awkward staging prevented me from seeing Violet at the family table at the peak of her rage. Estelle Parsons was formidable in the role but one of Vis daughters had plunked herself down between her mother and me. The movie provides perfect sight lines meaning a chance to see Ms. Streep do all of her stuff at every moment and she is marvelous. (So what else is new about her work?) In addition to raging Vi wheedles needles seduces and charms and her mental fogs disperse miraculously whenever she finds a chance to lacerate one of her loved ones with something mean. ENLARGE Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts. Weinstein Co. The movie also gives us a chance to see Ms. Roberts in action and shes marvelous too in an austere style that perfectly complements Ms. Streeps volcanism. Her Barbara has the dubious gifts of clarity and self-irony. She sees her mother and her family for the tortured people they are but shes still her mothers daughter. In a dark determinist comedy about the transmission of rage from one generation to the next this seemingly vital woman is incurably infected. The Invisible Woman Ralph Fienness elegantly crafted agreeably leisurely period drama does a public service by making the woman of the title visible. Born Ellen Ternan into a family of actors she was often called Nelly and as an 18-year-old became the very young and secret lover of Charles Dickens who was more than twice her age. The service lies partly in bringing Nelly out of obscurity--her story is one of a steep price paid for the passionate attention of a literary giant who may have had no love to give anyone but the characters in his books. It also lies in casting Felicity Jones who is as eloquent and beautifully modulated in the role as she is physically beautiful. Still Dickens dominates the story; hes a fiery presence as played by Mr. Fiennes who directed from Abi Morgans adaptation of a book by Claire Tomalin. ENLARGE Ralph Fiennes as Charles Dickens and Felicity Jones as Nelly Ternan Sony Pictures Classics This immeasurably famous writer and amateur actor doesnt mean to enslave Nelly to him. Still hes at the height of his career and engulfed by writing amateur acting and a gift for giving spellbinding readings. Its tempting to call him a 19th-century London version of a rock star but Dickens was far more accessible than that Londoners knew him flocked to him and drew pleasure from his proximity. Nelly draws pleasure too. Shes inexorably attracted to him even after she comes to understand that their relationship will remain secret. The film overemphasizes Dickenss emotional repression; in fact he was devastated by a terrible accident that in the film leaves him relatively cold and mainly concerned about preserving the secrecy of Nellys status. But ""The Invisible Woman"" gives us a plausible image of the great man in the fullness of his celebrity and an affecting portrait of the woman who lived much of her life in his shadow. Lone Survivor Peter Bergs screen version of Marcus Luttrells book is remarkably good at dramatizing the notorious 2005 Navy SEAL operation that went horrifically bad. The power of this production isnt evident in the preface a standard-brand account of the rigors of SEAL training. And familiar themes of combat movies make up most of the operations initial phase--cocky banter macho preening talk of wives and girlfriends back home. The first hint of whats to come is someones casually ominous observation about the complexity of the joint military planning ""A lot of moving parts."" ENLARGE ""Lone Survivor"" the story of four Navy SEALs on a covert mission to neutralize a high-level Taliban operative. Universal Pictures The parts were set in motion for Operation Red Wings a covert mission intended to kill or capture a Taliban commander in northern Afghanistan. A four-man team of SEALs was ambushed by Taliban fighters and the books author then the team medic was the lone survivor of a debacle that also took the lives of 16 men aboard a rescue helicopter shot down by a rocket-propelled grenade. Mr. Luttrell now retired is played by Mark Wahlberg; the other team members are played by Taylor Kitsch Emile Hirsch and Ben Foster. All four performances are first-rate and the action is staged with shattering intensity. Literally and graphically shattering. The film is a celebration of courage and the brotherhood of warriors facing unfathomable danger in the service of their country. These too are familiar themes but they take on new meaning in ""Lone Survivor."" The SEALs arent just shot at in a merciless firefight. They are shot time and again. They are almost aerated by Taliban bullets and they fight on. Their training has turned them into fighting machines and their equipment employs technologies undreamed of in earlier wars. Yet their high-tech edge is blunted by faulty communications their support is compromised by limited resources--the film doesnt try to score political points on this score but questions are implicit in the narrative--and their flesh and blood are anguishingly vulnerable when all the planning comes unraveled. A lot of moving parts in a moving film. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download ENLARGE Mean Streets (1973) This is the wellspring of Martin Scorseses career. Every potent element of his art flowed from it the violence the sense of evil the tribal warfare the fascination with criminality and the explosive style. Its a small-scale film with enormous impact even now four decades after it hit the screen. The setting is Little Italy where Mr. Scorsese grew up and the cast includes the stunningly young Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel. The script was written by Mardik Martin and the director who also played a gunman in a car. Greenberg (2010) ENLARGE Ben Stiller was uncompromisingly brilliant though widely unpopular in Noah Baumbachs comedy which scintillates with intelligence razors-edge humor and austere empathy for its struggling lovers. Mr. Stiller is Roger Greenberg a middle-aging misanthrope whose anger is matched only by his narcissism. Greta Gerwig gives a performance of heartbreaking delicacy as Florence Marr a wistful young woman falling into a love affair with him. ""Ive gotta stop doing things just because they feel good"" Florence says but theres no evidence she feels truly good about anything. Coriolanus (2011) ENLARGE In choosing one of Shakespeares more opaque plays for his directorial debut Ralph Fiennes emulated the character he portrays a refractory Roman general Caius Martius Coriolanus for whom compromise equals surrender. But the general comes to a bad end while Mr. Fiennes achieved a great beginning as a director and his performance stands as a chilling exemplar of psychomartial ferocity. The cast includes Jessica Chastain as the heros ardent wife Virgilia; Gerard Butler as Tullus Aufidius his mortal enemy; and Vanessa Redgrave as his mother Volumnia alongside whom todays tiger moms seem toothless. 129 Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post When the year in film 2013 is examined down the road it should have a few interesting footnotes concerning Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio. The copacetic duo have reteamed for their fifth film their plunge into excess ""The Wolf of Wall Street."" This often ugly occasionally funny and at nearly three hours overlong bit of business is based on the 2007 memoir of the same name by Jordan Belfort who in 1998 was indicted for securities fraud and money laundering. He served 22 months thanks in part to a deal cut with the FBI. It may say something touching about DiCaprio that he makes a far more interesting Jay Gatsby than a J. Belfort but then again F. Scott Fitzgeralds golden invention of reinvention is a more telling literary figure. Belfort who narrates his rise and fall as the duke of pump-and-dump stock trades is full of himself with nary an ounce of introspection. Australian actress Margot Robbie plays the second wife he trades up to Naomi his ""Duchess of Bayside."" What authentic character arc there is gets truncated once Belfort begins snorting powder gulping pills and humping prostitutes. And thats pretty early on. Jonah Hill does the movies best work portraying Donnie Jordans partner in the dodgy stock and later initial public offering enterprise. Contempt courses through ""The Wolf of Wall Street."" Sure Jordan and his merry band of brokers (as a 1991 Forbes article put it) have contempt for their investors. And Belfort according to a book reviewer also in Forbes was mighty short on contrition in his tell-all. But one gets a sense of Scorseses contempt too. Only filmmaking contempt is a funny thing. It has a way of conferring too much value on the very lifestyle it skewers. ""Wolf of Wall Street"" and Belfort has been likened to Caligula for the debauchery for the sex and drugs consumed. So it may be worth noting that the 1979 film about the Roman emperor written by Gore Vidal and co-financed by Penthouse mag wasnt very illuminating either. Sure ""Wolf of Wall Street"" -- adapted by Terrence Winter -- has its moments. A slow dumb tumble down a country-club staircase has Tim Conway absurdity to it. There were a number of appreciative Harvey Kormans at the preview screening. And the way in which the Quaaludes (which hes addicted to in addition to cocaine and morphine) hit the central nervous system is an endless source of amusement. When Belforts book was published a reviewer described it as a ""cross between Tom Wolfes The Bonfire of the Vanities and Scorseses GoodFellas."" Thats quite the circle. Movie influences the tone of book which then infuses the tone of the movie which is punctuated by Belforts voice-over which has none of the charm of Ray Liottas wiseguy observations in ""Goodfellas."" Its hard not to feel there is a better revisit of Scorseses crime gem already in theaters David O. Russells ""American Hustle."" Which is fun funny and even comes with a couple of insights into the erotic charge of corruption and the need for greed.

Starring Leonardo DiCaprio Margot Robbie Jonah Hill and Kyle Chandler. Directed by Martin Scorsese. (R. 180 minutes.) Though ""Raging Bull"" must still go down as Martin Scorseses greatest achievement ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" makes the race for No. 2 a lot more interesting. It is his first since ""Goodfellas"" to break through that mystical barrier that separates ""Oh yes that was excellent"" from ""Wow that was amazing."" And it is the best and most enjoyable American film to be released this year. It runs a full three hours but feels that long only in terms of its abundance. Theres just so much here - so many characters so many famous faces so many turns of story so many indelible set pieces - that thinking about it afterward is like contemplating some deranged tapestry. Yet as an experience as time spent in a theater seat it is the fastest three hours imaginable. Supposedly the original cut was six hours long. If all six were like this that would have been fine. To the extent that its reminiscent of any of Scorseses previous films ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is something like the crazy last third of ""Goodfellas"" in which Ray Liotta juggled a dinner party a drug habit and an airport drop while federal helicopters circled overhead. ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" has a similar freneticism a fluidity of camera movement and a dark comic sensibility that lets you know that funny though it is this cant end well. Like so many of Scorseses films it tells the story of one mans career in crime. It follows Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) - Terence Winters dazzling screenplay is based on Belforts memoir - from his 1980s initiation into the cult of Wall Street through the rise and fall of his own brokerage firm in which he perfected the art of bilking clients and laundering money. He is a charming snake-oil salesman in love with an idea of himself that isnt really true and in this way he shares a family resemblance with other roles played by Leonardo DiCaprio - Gatsby J. Edgar Hoover Frank in ""Revolutionary Road"" and Howard Hughes. Handsome fraud But Jordan Belfort is the ultimate both in what it demands from DiCaprio and what it brings out of him. Jordan believes that he is glamorous that his clients money is better spent by him because he at least knows what to do with it. He spends it on drugs prostitutes a garish yacht and a helicopter that he flies while intoxicated. The orgy sequences arent the usual forlorn movie orgies but scenes from inside a mad party and they had to be edited down to avoid an NC-17 rating. They couldnt have been edited much. Playing a fraud an emotional infant and a moral slob - who is also a very handsome and appealing guy - DiCaprio responds with a performance that matches the verbal pyrotechnics of Robert Preston with the physical comedy of Jerry Lewis. Its a huge performance an abandoned performance one that requires that he push sell and celebrate in between panicking raving and in one notable case foaming at the mouth from a drug overdose. DiCaprios sheer energy is staggering but so is his subtlety and his comic precision. One of the great quiet scenes shows Jordan on his yacht trying to charm an FBI agent (Kyle Chandler) whose dream in life is to put him behind bars. Watch DiCaprios eyes as he slowly realizes that the conversation isnt really going his way. ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" finds Scorsese at his most playful and inventive with scenes in which we hear what the characters are thinking and others in which we see what a character thinks is happening when something else is happening altogether. The camera swoops down and pans over crowds and the songs on the soundtrack always have some connection with the action. DiCaprios voice-over narration peppered throughout is never an intrusion and is sometimes side-splitting. Strong supporting cast Scorsese at this point can get just about anybody to take a small part in one of his movies but he doesnt abuse that. Matthew McConaughey (still skinny from ""Dallas Buyers Club"") appears in only two scenes but his role as a loony broker who counsels the young Jordan to masturbate at least twice a day is made to order. Likewise Jean Dujardin is ideal casting in the small role of a Swiss banker whose happy smile cant hide the larcenous soul. Its a running joke that he is able to speak and understand English only when its convenient. The cliche about tales such as ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is that they tell a quintessentially American story and sometimes cliches are true. But the allure of Jordan as a character is not that he represents something poisonous in the American soul but rather that he represents a poisonous byproduct of something otherwise glorious in the American soul - the drive for splendor the belief in endless reinvention. Jordan has the same dream most Americans have only he gets sick on it. Finally one more word about Scorsese. This is the first film of his 70s and at least according to Orson Welles the 70s and 20s are when an artist does his best work. Perhaps Scorsese is intent on proving Welles right. He could not have made a stronger start. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Comments (3) click to enlarge The Wolf of Wall Street Recommended Video Rated R  180 minutes  2013 If youre one of those Martin Scorsese fans who have been waiting 20 years for another Goodfellas your ship has come in from the incessant conspiratorial voice-over narration to the grotesque freeze frames to the balls-out celebration of money and power this giddy biopic of stock-market hustler Jordan Belfort is almost a carbon copy of the directors gangland classic. Leonardo DiCaprio plays the title character and a tour de force sequence in which he tries to drag himself to his sports car while sloppy on Quaaludes reveals the actors mostly untapped comic skill. In fact the whole thing plays more like farce than drama aside from Belfort the characters are broad and flat and theres little regard for the countless middle-class investors he bilked. As with Goodfellas Scorseses helpless attraction to the very behavior he wants to indict becomes the movies serrated edge.

(Mary Cybulski) B+ The Wolf of Wall Street Genre Drama; Starring Leonardo DiCaprio Jonah Hill Matthew McConaughey; Director Martin Scorsese; Release Date Wide 12/25/2013; Runtime (in minutes) 179; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Paramount Studios Posted January 15 2014 -- 1200 AM EST Pay no attention to the title Martin Scorseses new shoot-the-works epic The Wolf of Wall Street isnt about rapacious stockbrokers or shady financial shenanigans. Its about drugs. Lots and lots of drugs. From its twisted opening scene where a floor of coked-up boiler-room meatheads toss dwarfs for bacchanalian sport the feverishly paced film is hell-bent on making the audience feel like they just snorted a Belushian mountain of blow. You can practically feel your teeth grinding to dust. As with any high though it also doesnt know when to stop. Based on Wall Street evil genius Jordan Belforts 2007 memoir about getting insanely rich from conning investors Wolf stars Leonardo DiCaprio as an amoral Horatio Alger with a rolled C-note up his nose. He gives a hell of a performance thats electrifyingly loose perversely funny and dripping with jerk charisma. Like Ray Liotta in GoodFellas DiCaprios character explains through wise-guy voice-overs how he pulled off one of the most brazen and boneheaded scams in history. The film chronicles Belforts improbable ascent from eager brokerage-house trainee (under the gonzo tutelage of a scene-stealing Matthew McConaughey) to Black Monday casualty to silver-tongued swindler cold-calling suckers to peddle them worthless stocks out of a former auto-body garage. He proves to be such a born salesman that in no time he and his merry band of macho Bayside Queens goombahs (led by a terrific Jonah Hill as Belforts bucktoothed loose-cannon sidekick) have more money than they know what to do with. So they blow it on Bond-villain yachts trophy wives and insane quantities of coke. Soon the firm becomes a millionaire-minting mecca attracting both wannabe Gordon Gekkos and the attention of a hungry FBI agent (Kyle Chandler) who drools over Belforts nouveau-riche toys while vowing to bring the drug-fueled Caligula down. It says something about DiCaprios oily charm that you almost want him to get away with it. As bad judgment and paranoia take hold and the high rollers get careless about stashing their loot in Swiss banks Wolfs pace never stops panting. And you cant help but be amazed that its the work of a 71-year-old. After five decades behind the camera Scorsese still works with the frantic energy of a man whos got something to prove. But the director also has to know that his film could have used some trimming. Clocking in at just a minute under three hours Wolf starts to repeat itself as were given one scene after another of men behaving badly. If youre feeling charitable you could argue that the movies running time is meant to mirror its theme of excess. Then again you could also say that its just way too long. Theres a reason roller-coaster rides last for only a few minutes. Still Scorsese has pulled off something tricky with Wolf Hes given us a thrilling cautionary tale about a guy who never for a second seems the slightest bit sorry for what hes done. If anything he just had the bad luck to get caught. B+ Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

Do we really need another movie about a Wall Street shark living high and scraping bottom? The film is almost three hours long and precious little of it feels new - not from Scorsese or from anybody else. DiCaprios Jordan Belfort upon whose memoir this film written by Terence Winter is loosely based goes from two-bit broker on Long Island to major player earning 49 million by the time he was twenty-six mostly from bogus blue chip stock sales. Scads of that money went up his nose or into a daisy chain of orgiastic extravaganzas - many of which we are subjected to ad nauseam.DiCaprio doesnt seem terribly comfortable in the role despite all his strutting and posturing. Maybe its because the film never allows him to get inside Belforts psyche. Its essentially a celebration of sharkdom. (The victims of Belforts chicanery are barely dealt with.) Jonah Hill plays Belforts cohort and punching bag Donnie Azoff and the actor sports his whitest teeth ever. Too bad there isnt enough here for him to sink his teeth into. Grade C (Rated R for sequences of strong sexual content graphic nudity drug use and language throughout and for some violence.)

In some of his movies -- films like ""Raging Bull"" or ""Taxi Driver"" that show the descent of a tortured soul -- those voices are often internal. ""I hear things"" Jake LaMotta mutters darkly. ""You talkin to me?"" Travis Bickle asks his mirror. But in other films his protagonists arent the tempted but the tempters. And they instead speak directly to us Henry recalling the joy of being one of the ""Goodfellas"" Ace guiltlessly explaining the scams that made him millions off a ""Casino"" Frank lovingly describing the old neighborhood he runs in ""The Departed."" They smile. They whisper in our ears. They are that small insinuating voice in the shadows and they say -- Whaddaya a mook? Ya wanna be poor all your life? Come and be rich. Come and be me. Both hungry and heartless DiCaprios antihero soon climbs to the top as The Wolf of Wall StreetPARAMOUNT Its the explicit come-on of ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" Scorseses gleefully vulgar bitterly funny return to his world of handsome heartless hell-bound seducers. Here the devil is Jordan Belfort a kid with the happy honk of Queens and the slippery smile of Leonardo DiCaprio. Hes a Gatsby as rewritten by Budd Schulberg all make and no music; he yearns to get rich not because he has big dreams but because thats his only dream. Its a mostly real story and the script by Terence Winter -- a veteran of both ""The Sopranos"" and ""Boardwalk Empire"" -- interweaves other bits of reality including cameos by people playing real-life celebrities and a TV commercial for Belforts firm thats a bald-faced steal from the old Dreyfus Fund ads. But what makes the film truly authentic is the intimacy as Belfort often talking directly to the screen tells us how he used penny stocks pump-and-dump schemes and -- but wait you dont really wanna know do you he says with a grin. And just as hes reeled us in like the best conmen he pretends to retreat only so well pursue. Scorseses camera is on him constantly and constantly in motion swerving around the Wall Street bullpens where profoundly profane people buy and sell anything. Yet it finds time to shrewdly observe characters too. Jonah Hills flabby unreliable partner. Belforts diamond-hard second wife Margot Robbbie. And Kyle Chandlers square-jawed FBI man who finally begins to pry into the books. But the person Scorsese really watches is DiCaprio who has grown into maturity over their five films together while remaining at almost 40 still able to tap into pure baby-faced amorality. Why would a man cheat people out of millions and then spend it on hookers ludes and stupid pranks? Hey why wouldnt you? Of course even in the creative-accounting world of Wall Street -- and Hollywood -- all bills eventually come due and in the last and slightly too-long third of the film Belforts many addictions catch up with him. There are painfully extended scenes of him stumbling drooling flopping on the floor like a dying fish; Scorsese -- who had his own dissolute days long ago -- never even blinks. N.J. NEWS ON THE GO Our redesigned mobile site has quick page loads and app-style navigation and lets you join the conversation with comments and social media. Visit NJ.com from any mobile browser. The film nonetheless drew gasps and nervous giggles at early screenings and also some outrage even from hardened critics. Belfort was degenerate misogynistic and worse unrepentant they complained. Who wants to spend three hours with that? But how much does any great Scorsese character truly change? Or even want to? What is Franks endless shrug of self-justification? ""No one gives it to you -- you have to take it."" What is Ace Rothsteins only real regret after a life in Vegas? ""The big corporations took it all over. Today it looks like Disneyland."" And Henry Hills sole bitter realization? ""Im an average nobody. Get to live the rest of my life like a schnook."" These men do no penance. But thats because theyre the sin not the sinner -- theyre lust and wrath and avarice made flesh waiting in the shadows watching your approach whispering in your ear. They will never regret and they will never change. After all they have been in this world since the beginning. And they will be here until the end. Ratings note The film contains graphic nudity and sexual situations drug and alcohol abuse strong language and violence. The Wolf of Wall Street (R) Paramount (179 min.) Directed by Martin Scorsese.

(AP Photo/Paramount Pictures Mary Cybulski) Leonardo DiCaprio as Jordan Belfort in a scene from ""The Wolf of Wall Street."" (AP Photo/Paramount Pictures Mary Cybulski) In Martin Scorseses ""Goodfellas"" the scenes of cocaine-fueled paranoia are so infectiously tense that its a relief when the cops come and restore order. In Scorseses new movie ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" the druggy delirium lasts for three hours bolstered by two other intoxicants money and sex.The most exhilarating film of the year is also the most exhausting. Part of that exhaustion is the mental effort of traveling back to the 1990s. Thats when selfish jerks such as Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) were mistaken for heroes.Belfort is a young middle-class New Yorker who fails on Wall Street and then answers an ad for a penny-stock trader. From a suburban strip mall he builds an empire with the help of doughy dogged lieutenant Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill) an army of cold-calling cut-throats and an investment strategy called ""pump and dump"" buying bad stocks promoting those stocks to suckers and then bailing out before facts about the assets cause a crash. The strategy works well enough that Belfort gets the keys to a Manhattan lifestyle including an upgraded girlfriend (Margot Robbie) and a 2 million bachelor party.One could quibble that there are so many scenes of stockbrokers snorting coke off hookers boobs that this thrill ride becomes nauseating. Belfort often addresses the camera as if this were an informercial for the American Dream and we cant find the remote control to change the channel. (And actually Belfort does do a commercial before feds led by Kyle Chandler flip the script.) But Scorsese as always knows exactly what he is doing. Although its long the movie is never less than entertaining. From the sunshine-bright colors to the wall-to-wall rock and roots music its a feast for the senses. And the cast shares the fun starting with Matthew McConaughey in an opening-segment cameo as Belforts rip-off role model. But this is DiCaprios show and a scene in which he crawls to his sports car on quaalude-quaking legs belongs in a time capsuleFor the holidays DiCaprio and Scorsese have gifted us with another classic American story.

Mary Cybulski/Paramount Pictures hide caption toggle caption Mary Cybulski/Paramount Pictures The Wolf of Wall Street Director Martin Scorsese Genre Comedy Biography Crime Running Time 180 minutes Rated R for sequences of strong sexual content graphic nudity drug use and language throughout and for some violence. With Leonardo DiCaprio Jonah Hill Margot Robbie Matthew McConaughey Kyle Chandler Several times during The Wolf of Wall Street the wolf himself turns to the camera and offers to explain some stockbroker term or strategy. But then he stops himself and says it doesnt really matter. It sure doesnt -- not in this exuberant but profitless bad-behavior romp. Its based on the career of former penny-stock magnate Jordan Belfort but might as well be about Keith Richards in the 70s or Robert Downey Jr. in the 90s. ""I love drugs"" announces Belfort early in the movie which proceeds to demonstrate this passion so often that susceptible viewers may experience a contact high. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Belfort in his fifth and most dominating collaboration with director Martin Scorsese. There are hundreds of others -- the broker also loves sex and you cant have orgy scenes without lots of bodies -- but DiCaprios broad swagger and Scorseses narrow focus reduce most of the other performances to cameos. The principal exceptions are a scary Jonah Hill as Donnie Belforts nebbishy and utterly venal lieutenant and a feisty Margot Robbie as Naomi the financiers sexy (and frequently undressed) second wife. Few of the others really register save for Matthew McConaughey as Belforts chest-thumping Wall Street role model and The Artists Jean Dujardin as a frozen-grinned Swiss banker so avaricious hes prepared to deal with -- shudder -- Americans. The saga really begins in 1987 when Belfort then a fledgling Wall Streeter is forced to reinvent himself after the Black Monday crash. He sets up in a crummy Long Island boiler room touting cheap stocks to people who cant afford even those low-rent investments. What hes selling is the promise of future wealth; what hes keeping is the real money of steady commissions. Belfort gets rich then richer. He drinks snorts cocaine and indulges a special fondness for Quaaludes. The camerawork and the editing however are adrenalized in Scorseses usual manner. The movie barrels through time and space boosted by punky songs whose titles say it all ""One Step Beyond"" ""Never Say Never"" ""Uncontrollable Urge."" Yet the zooming visuals dont propel the story to any place in particular. Sure an FBI agent (Kyle Chandler) is nosing around and Naomi eventually rebels against her husbands thing for other women mostly hookers. But Belforts character such as it is remains unchanged. Various Cheech-and-Chong-style slapstick scenarios play out repeatedly just with different props. The perpetually buzzed Belfort variously trashes a helicopter a sports car and a yacht and he rolls down a set of stairs in a luded daze. His 1998 bust feels as much like an intervention as an arrest. For all its outrageousness though the movie seems overfamiliar and not just because DiCaprio played a self-inventing Long Island plutocrat and party boy earlier this year in The Great Gatsby. Scorsese too is on oft-trod turf The director has recently specialized in larger-than-life protagonists within tiny tales a formula he continues here. If the use of competing voiceovers and other flashy storytelling gambits isnt as awkward as in the Scorsese-aping American Hustle its only because Wolfs essential narrative is much simpler. It didnt have to be. Terence Winter a veteran of The Sopranos and Boardwalk Empire who based his script on Belforts memoir could have allowed the broker to talk high finance as well as high times. Instead the filmmakers merely mirror Belforts excess spending three hours -- and a reported 100 million -- chiefly to have some nasty fun. Rather than digging into investment-market manipulations The Wolf of Wall Street just surfs the wave of corruption digging the view from up there.

"Wolf of Wall Street The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ...

His most celebrated movies are Taxi Driver Raging Bull Goodfellas and The Departed - all intense uncompromising samples of cinema at its finest. Scorsese however has never been easy to pigeonhole; he has always enjoyed playing in unconventional sandboxes. Some may recall that he followed up Casino with Kundun that he entered Merchant-Ivory territory with The Age of Innocence or that he predated the Coen Brothers in surreal comedy with After Hours. Scorsese is about far more than mobsters De Niro Pesci and profanity-laden tirades. Nowhere is this more evident that in The Wolf of Wall Street. The Wolf of Wall Street joins After Hours as the most openly comedic films Scorsese has made. The movie isnt a nonstop treadmill of jokes and gags; instead the blackly humorous elements are incorporated into a screenplay that questions the ""get rich"" mentality that has always infected Wall Street. Although an indictment of greed the movie establishes the anti-hero in this case Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) as a quasi-sympathetic figure. Viewed objectively Belfort - a materialistic drug-addicted womanizing thief - is the kind of character who could easily fill the villains role. Hes the kind of white-collar criminal whose activities led to the 2008 economic melt-down and who would feel at home swapping stories with Bernie Madoff. Yet by shaping the movie the way he does Scorsese presents Belfort as a charismatic Caligula. He is an endlessly fascinating character who holds viewers attention from beginning to end. Many of Scorseses best films have used real-life stories as their underpinning and this is no exception. The director is quick to point out that the screenplay credited to Terence Winter is a fictionalization of Belforts life and takes numerous liberties. This isnt a documentary and its not intended to be one. As a result Scorsese can amplify elements of Belforts life to accentuate the comedy or the tragedy of a given situation. Although The Wolf of Wall Street features some strongly dramatic elements many of the films flourishes are designed for laughs. Throughout his long career Scorsese has been known for pushing the envelope of the MPAAs R-rating. The Wolf of Wall Street is replete with naked bodies and acts of sexual depravity. Theres also copious drug use and frequent profanity but very little in the way of physical violence. This isnt that kind of story. This is about how the pursuit of money above all else can transform a hard-working family man into a kingpin of immorality and debauchery. This is DiCaprios fifth outing for Scorsese but the first time in which the director has turned him loose. The result is an astounding courageous performance the likes of which we havent yet seen from the talented actor. Throughout the movie Belfort gives pep talks to his ever-growing flock of broker disciples. These are reminiscent of Alec Baldwins scathing monologue at the beginning of Glengarry Glen Ross but instead of galvanizing an audience for ten minutes DiCaprio does it for three hours. The Wolf of Wall Street tells the tale of Belforts rise and fall. Parts are presented in flashback with DiCaprio providing a self-mocking voiceover. Its a rags-to-riches story about a hard-working broker who breaks into the industry in the late 80s and has the misfortune of earning his license on Black Monday the day of the biggest crash since the 20s. He subsequently loses his job but reinvents himself as a purveyor of ""penny stocks."" Fraud abounds in this ill-regulated dark corner of the financial industry and Belfort rides the wave to wealth. Hes able to found his own company Stratton Oakmont and surround himself with cronies like Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill) who shares his taste for quaaludes. He dumps his first wife for a hot blond Naomi Lapaglia (Margot Robbie). The SEC starts to notice Stratton Oakmont but Belforts real problems begin when FBI agent Greg Coleman (Kyle Chandler) opens a file on him. DiCaprios turn is ably supported by a tremendous supporting cast. Jonah Hill is creepily effective as Belforts drug-addled sidekick. Its a part that straddles drama and dark comedy and is perfect for the actor. Matthew McConaughey who appears in only three scenes gives an unforgettable speech. Australian actress Margot Robbie amps up the sexual tension with a performance thats likely to expand her Hollywood profile. There are some nice turns by members of Scorseses directing fraternity (all of whom have previous credits in front of the camera) Spike Jonze Jon Favreau and a brilliant Rob Reiner. The movie is littered with acting gems - some from expected sources and some that arrive out-of-the-blue. By turning this into a comedy Scorsese assures a different tone from Wall Street and Boiler Room. There are serious aspects to The Wolf of Wall Street but the filmmakers dont want to get caught digging in areas where the ground has already been tilled. Belfort may have the same predatory instincts as Gordon Gekko but hes not as smart and lives a more extravagant lifestyle. In fact one could talk at length between similarities between Belfort and DiCaprios other 2013 character Jay Gatsby. I laughed more during The Wolf of Wall Street than I did during any of 2013s ""pure"" comedies. Maybe thats an indication that my warped sense of humor is a match for Scorseses sensibilities. This is an example of what a supremely talented actor can do under the auspices of one of the best working directors. Some things in The Wolf of Wall Street will undoubtedly offend more sensitive movie-goers but that goes with the territory for Scorsese. The Wolf of Wall Street crackles with energy and justifies its length offering three of the most riveting hours available this holiday season.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Colin Covert colincovert In a dog-eat-dog environment willingness to hurt others is a competitive advantage. Which explains why the testosterone-soaked stockbrokers in ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" love a good dwarf-tossing contest. The opening image of Martin Scorseses euphoric film is a nervous little fella hurtling like a dart toward a target in a brokerage office. Whoever hits the bulls-eye wins 25000. Its a perfect metaphor for America under the stewardship of financial con artists. If some little people are banged up while billions are being made so what? Money and dwarves were made to be thrown around. The brilliance of Scorseses film is that it delivers this strong-medicine rebuke not with a spoonful of sugar but a nose full of blow. ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a fleet-footed three hours of startling moments 99 percent of them hedonistic and hilarious. This movie gazes into the abyss and laughs out loud. It makes moral bankruptcy look like a blast especially when its accompanied by an orgy of mansions luxury goods and well orgies. As in ""Goodfellas"" Scorseses new film comes not to bury its colorful villains but to praise them. The main perp slings a genial arm around our shoulder tells the story from his own point of view and thrills us with his shady audacity. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Jordan Belfort the amiable unapologetic stock fraudster whose memoir inspired the film. Belfort is a real piece of work and so is DiCaprio. He plays Belfort as a clueless colossal amoral jerk whos convinced hes the smartest most desirable and most charming person in the room. No in the world. The fact that he manages to crash a helicopter his Lamborghini two marriages and his 120-foot yacht (in a riotous lampoon of ""Titanic"") never deflates his narcissism. DiCaprios triumph is that he makes us enjoy this magnetic monster. He radiates the sort of warped charisma that explains how a hustler from the outer boroughs could build a hot-air empire. He makes the character credible -- in fact unforgettable. When he dances like a nut and flings 100 bills and cooked lobsters at FBI agents we feel were looking at an epic comically myopic D-bag not an actor playing one. THE WOLF OF WALL STREET  out of 4 stars  Rating R for sequences of strong sexual content graphic nudity drug use and language throughout and for some violence. Jonah Hill sporting incandescent white teeth plays grasping junior partner Donnie Azoff his most abrasive least ingratiating character ever yet one of his funniest. In one outrageous passage he and Belfort wrecked on Quaaludes lurch through the worst night in recorded history. That sublimely idiotic sequence could be released on its own if there were a market for R-rated comedy featurettes. Incapable of making a U-turn away from disaster Belfort loses his securities license though not his entire fortune. He reinvents himself as a motivational speaker for aspiring salesmen. In the films final image we see his audience a hall full of cow-eyed yearners desperate to acquire what hes got. Here as in the opening close-up of that fretful flying dwarf its not a movie screen were looking at. Its a mirror.

"The Wolf of Wall Street (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Wolf of Wall Street (R) Martin Scorseses riotous comedy about financial corruption starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com12/23/2013 Editor rating 4 The stockbroker and financial investor Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) made 49 million by the time he was 26. Judging by The Wolf of Wall Street its a miracle he lived that long. Early in his career when he was young and wide-eyed and married to a pretty hair stylist (Cristin Milioti) Jordan got some advice over lunch with a billionaire (a chest-thumping Matthew McConaughey) he took to heart The two keys to success on Wall Street are cocaine and hookers. Keep plenty of both around all the time and you will become a Master of the Universe. Jordan takes note of the tip but he doesnt really believe it at first. A few years later by the time he was sailing around the world in his 170-foot yacht (complete with helicopter landing pad) and his model-beautiful second wife (Margot Robbie) there wasnt a drug Jordan hadnt abused an attractive woman he hadnt slept with and a party he had thrown that hadnt turned into a deranged bacchanalia. Jordans meteoric rise to success which began by swindling ordinary people with penny stocks and grew to the point where he guided the IPO launch of footwear magnate Steve Madden is depicted by Martin Scorsese as a raucous wallow in vulgarity excess and debauchery. If it had been a drama The Wolf of Wall Street might have been unwatchable Theres simply too much of everything. But Scorsese and screenwriter Terence Winter (The Sopranos Boardwalk Empire) hit on the genius idea to turn the story into a riotous comedy one that keeps topping itself everytime you think it cant possibly get crazier. Scorsese has often ventured into dark comic territory before -- there are bits in Goodfellas and Casino that are as hilarious as they are horrifying and The King of Comedy makes you laugh as often as you cringe -- but he has never made a movie this free and spirited and insane and fun. This isnt a personal Scorsese picture Unlike his films about Italian-American culture mobsters loners and movies he feels little but disdain for Jordan and his merry band of suit-and-tie thieves (including an unhinged Jonah Hill rocking some Elton John-sized eyewear and blindingly white capped teeth). That emotional distance allows the director to cut loose in ways he never has before which will inevitably lead some viewers to wring their hands and cluck about immorality and reprehensibleness (at a screening for Academy members earlier this week someone yelled ""Shame on you"" at the director as he stepped out of an elevator). But to confuse the contact-high the onscreen revelry imparts as the filmmakers approval is a misguided reading of the movie. This is a film about awful people doing horrible things only instead of guns and violence they trade on decadence and power. The only respectable character in The Wolf of Wall Street is Patrick Denham (Kyle Chandler) an FBI agent who becomes suspicious of Jordans flamboyance and launches the investigation that eventually toppled his empire. Scorsese lets their first scene together run for a while so we see how shrewd and intelligent Patrick is at toying with his prey and how arrogant and foolish Jordan is by thinking this is just another problem he can solve by throwing money at it. There are several longer-than-usual scenes (by Scorseses standards) in The Wolf of Wall Street including some rally-the-troops speeches Jordan gives to his tribe of savage financiers that help you understand why they worshipped him like a deity. It wasnt just because he made them rich DiCaprio who has rarely been better taps into the verbal dexterity and irresistible charisma of a man who could sell a donkey to a race car driver over the phone if he wanted to. The movie runs three hours but the time flies and the antics never get repetitious. Late in the film comes one of the most astonishing scenes of the year -- a lengthy gut-busting setpiece in which DiCaprio reveals a tremendous gift for physical comedy he had never hinted at before. After playing so many moody tortured types the actor seems happy and energized by the opportunity to experiment and have fun and Scorsese channels his energy into this fiery exuberant carnival of a movie. The director even lands his closing shot something he hasnt always done well leaving no doubt how he feels about Jordan abandoning him in a perpetual hell of his own making. The Wolf of Wall Street isnt a celebration of bad behavior Its a condemnation. Scorsese just allows you to share in the fun young millionaires can afford to have and lets you get drunk with them. Eventually though the party must end as they always do and most will leave the theater exhilarated and relieved at being part of the 99 percent.

(Photo by Mary Cybulski) By Ann Hornaday December 24 2013 Follow AnnHornaday In a palatial mansion on Long Island a lone well-dressed millionaire played in an all-out performance by Leonardo DiCaprio presides virtually unseen over a bacchanal of benumbed excess the avatar of an age of heedless self-indulgence and greed. Ah so the 3-D version of ""The Great Gatsby"" is being re-released? Not quite. In ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" Martin Scorseses big bravura maddeningly uneven indictment of the extreme financial depredations that characterized the 1990s DiCaprio plays Jordan Belfort a real-life swindler and penny-stock con man who made more than 100 million off of unwitting investors. The Queens-born Belfort may embody the same ambition and shadowy ruthlessness as F. Scott Fitzgeralds self-made anti-hero but he has none of his subtlety or allegorical heft. Theres no enigmatic green light goading Belfort on in ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" other than the unseen internal one telling him to go go go and get more more more. More in this case doesnt just mean money -- although in one of Belforts several speeches to his employees delivered in a style suggesting Henry V combined with a touch of Catskills tummler -- he suggests that whatever problems they may have they should solve them by getting rich. As ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" makes clear from its first aggressive whipsawing moments Belfort is the ultimate empty vessel a man who can never get enough of anything whether its sex or drugs or validation from the audience he addresses by way of near-constant narration occasionally breaking the fourth wall for a contemptuous tutorial in Darwinian finance. Belfort is such a thoroughly loathsome character that it makes ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" difficult to process as art much less entertainment. Theres no doubt that Scorsese -- working with screenwriter Terence Winter cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto and longtime editor Thelma Schoonmaker -- is still working at the top of his game his sheer technical chops and exuberant commitment exerting an insistent sleeve-tugging pull. Juxtaposing blues and Afro-pop riffs with shiny nouveau-riche settings and at least two astonishing set pieces Scorsese evinces the same canny eye and ear that make his movies compulsively watchable regardless of who or what theyre about. Only a filmmaker of his prowess and infectious energy can make three hours zip by this fast. But in ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" the films nominal subjects -- Belforts ignominious rise (did he ever really fall?) and the gluttonous underbelly of capitalism he represents -- arent particularly interesting or new. When Belfort joins with his future partner Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill) when he marries his stunning second wife Naomi (the angel-faced fiery-eyed Margot Robbie) when he finally comes under the scrutiny of Patrick Denham (Kyle Chandler) an even-keel FBI agent none of those relationships ever manages to be fully realized. Like DiCaprios theyre superb even brave performances in search of somewhere to go go go. Instead ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" remains one-note even at is most outre an episodic portrait of rapaciousness in which decadence escalates into debauchery escalates into depravity -- but miraculously not death. Its a movie composed of several memorable moments -- Matthew McConaugheys deranged Tuvan throat singing as Belforts early mentor; a spectacular and cosmically unjust rescue at sea; a tawdry rampage through Las Vegas that costs 2 million in hookers drugs and hotel repairs; Belforts degenerate office parties. The films centerpiece is a Keaton-esque sequence in which DiCaprio delivers a druggy feat of physical acting thats both appalling and viciously viscously funny. But to what end? ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" doesnt implicate the audience in Belforts desires the way ""Goodfellas"" seduced viewers with its intimate textured vignettes of Henry Hills life in the Mafia. Belfort is too scuzzy the material culture he inhabits too bland and superficial to create that kind of vicarious sympathy. But nor does the film ever empower its saner voices to give Belfort an adequate dramatic foil. (A line from Belforts father about ""chickens coming home to roost"" is especially lame Gee Dad ya think?) Chandlers clean-cut FBI agent would have been the perfect Javert to Belforts monotonous amorality. As it is he gets only one or two substantive scenes one a subway ride home that speaks volumes for being wordless and relatively brief. That meaningful eloquent moment notwithstanding ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" maintains an oddly equivocating ethical stance throughout its vertiginous slide through the muck. On one hand the filmmakers suggest that Belforts most dehumanizing behavior is what undergirds every Wall Street firm that behind those stentorian ads and Forbes profiles are just a bunch of tacky boiler-room bros with their snouts in the trough. But in the final analysis they pull their punches on Belfort -- who actually appears in the final scene of the movie wielding what else a microphone (reportedly he has yet to pay up fully on the 110 million he owes in restitution to his victims). In ""Goodfellas"" which still reigns supreme as Scorseses finest plunge into the low life the film ends on that teasingly ambiguous shot of Ray Liottas Mona Lisa smile. In ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" Scorsese turns his gaze on the audience itself suggesting that its our own avarice -- or at least fatal naivete -- that creates monsters like Belfort. Okay but really? Belfort turned out to be a harbinger years before his more well-heeled but equally crooked colleagues at white-shoe Manhattan firms cooked up what may be the largest transfer of wealth in human history. And its schmoes like us that ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" holds accountable? That laughing sound you hear just out of eye-shot may well be Belfort having the last howl.   1/2 R. At area theaters.

Paramount Pictures Mary Cybulski Mary Cybulski The Wolf of Wall Street Director Martin Scorsese Cast Leonardo DiCaprio Jonah Hill Jon Bernthal Rated R (strong sexual content graphic nudity drug use strong language violence) Running time 180 min. By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 457pm on Tuesday Dec. 24 2013 Tuesday Dec. 24 2013 Tuesday Dec. 24 2013 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram The Wolf of Wall Street comes shackled with impossibly high expectations.Its the latest film from Martin Scorsese (arguably this countrys greatest living director) features two of the eras most notable leading men (Leonardo DiCaprio and Matthew McConaughey) and runs three hours (Hollywood proof that this is ""important"" people). It also happens to be of the cultural moment based on Jordan Belforts bestselling memoir about his days as a young ruthless Wall Street warlord. As the country continues to struggle its way out of the 2008 financial collapse theres still interest in how it all might have gone down.So its a relief and a pleasant surprise that Wall Street despite some missteps and the need for an editor mostly manages to live up to the interest generated by its kinetic trailers and the heavy hand of hype. While there are obvious similarities to such previous Scorsese films as Goodfellas and Casino this freewheeling and often ferociously funny film about a bunch of goofballs -- pumped up on coke crooked capitalism testosterone and entitlement -- stands on its own as one of the years most entertaining films.At the films start working-class Belfort (DiCaprio) is at his first menial Wall Street job being treated like dirt by his supervisor but getting some sage -- and hilarious -- advice on how to survive in this shark tank by a co-worker (McConaughey in a far-too-brief cameo). But the year is 1987 and the firm is taken down by that years financial crisis. Belfort is back to square one.Thats when he stumbles across a low-rent brokerage house dealing in penny stocks which according to the film at least were often sold by the unscrupulous to working-class Joes looking to get rich quick. Belfort decides to flip the script by trying to sell penny stocks to his old blue-chip customers. If Belforts clients fortunes dont improve his certainly do -- so much so that he starts his own firm. His success is so fast and furious that the business press dubs him ""The Wolf of Wall Street.""His life turns into a nonstop party and no one parties harder than his business partner Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill). Their slow-motion brawl while whacked out on quaaludes is going to be one of those scenes that filmgoers will be talking about well into the spring.Of course what goes up must come down and helping along with that is federal agent Patrick Denham (Kyle Chandler) whos looking for just the right opportunity to bust Belforts entire operation.While the general arc of the story is no shock how Scorsese and writer Terence Winter ( The Sopranos Boardwalk Empire) tell it -- breaking the fourth wall a near-constant electric sense of movement -- keeps it fresh. And DiCaprio who couldnt fill the shoes of The Great Gatsby gives a refreshingly loose-limbed compelling performance that ranks as one of his best.Yes there are scenes that go on too long (Scorseses original cut ran four hours so it could have been worse). Yes Scorsese has trod this territory -- young men gone impossibly bad -- before.But when its done this well theres little reason to complain.

"The Wolf of Wall Street is Leonardo DiCaprios best role yet review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Wolf of Wall Street is Leonardo DiCaprios best role yet reviewIf youre down with a character arc thats a short as a crack pipe and equally resistant to temperance then this is your chance to howl.By Peter HowellMovie CriticTues. Dec. 24 2013The Wolf of Wall StreetStarring Leonardo DiCaprio Jonah Hill Matthew McConaughey Margot Robbie Kyle Chandler and Rob Reiner. Directed by Martin Scorsese. 180 minutes. Opens Dec. 25 at major theatres. 18AIf steady dramatic development and ennobling redemption are what you seek in a movie about a disreputable person then The Wolf of Wall Street may not be your idea of a grand night out.On the other hand if youre down with a character arc thats as short as a crack pipe and equally resistant to temperance then Martin Scorseses latest picture is your chance to howl.Article Continued BelowFor the first third of its wildly overlong three hours Scorseses film fairly bowls you over with its wild-eyed depiction of Wall Street as Animal House with excesses of the late 1980s through 1990s that included everything from dwarf tossing to cocaine snorting/smoking to hooker procuring and much much more. Did I mention that its sort of a comedy?The Wolf of Wall Street is as much Leonardo DiCaprios film as it is Martin Scorseses.Theres some stock trading too all of it calculated to separate suckers both rich and poor from their money.After this its just a matter of hanging on as many will eagerly choose to do even though the remaining two hours are essentially more of the same. We view these antics through the wandering eyes of the title character played with gusto by Leonardo DiCaprio and based on events that The Sopranos/Boardwalk Empire scribe Terence Winter adapted from stock swindler Jordan Belforts lupine 2007 memoirs.This is a movie sprinting to get down to bad business which may seem funny considering its marathon running time. Its 1987 and DiCaprios Belfort a Wall Street rookie has barely warmed the chair of his telephone-dialing gig at an investment firm when a senior stockbroker (Matthew McConaughey) invites him to a mentoring lunch indulgence of martinis coke masturbation (thankfully not on camera) and chest-thumping tribal chants. Its the best and funniest scene in the movie and McConaughey sadly exits the picture before too much longer. But Belfort takes to his macho call to action like a disco nose to white powder finding purpose in the pursuit of ""making more money than we knew what to do with.""He hits a major roadblock later that year as do all the other Wall Street bulls and bears as the infamous Black Monday incident sends stocks free-falling. Belfort gets back on his feet when he discovers the legal-but-sleazy world of penny stocks ""selling garbage to garbagemen"" and before long hes back in the big game running his own trading company with the faux fancy name of Stratton Oakmont.Dont worry if you cant follow all the financial ins and outs. All that dough drugs and dwarf-tossing is just incidental to the rough male bonding that has always been Scorseses favourite domain from Mean Streets to Raging Bull to Goodfellas to Gangs of New York to The Departed. He loves the company of men. Besides DiCaprio -- who delivers his finest performance yet in this his fifth Scorsese film -- he gives us Jonah Hill as Belmonts chief accomplice Rob Reiner as his outspoken dad Jean Dujardin as his wily Swiss Banker and Kyle Chandler as the hard-nosed FBI agent who wants to collar the wolf.They all provide sturdy support finding some distaff competition from Margot Robbies Naomi the model/mistress and later Belmont spouse who is anything but a Little Bo Peep. This is DiCaprios picture as much as Scorseses something the actor demonstrates in a jaw-dropping scene where he downs enough Quaaludes to drop an elephant and then has to somehow find his way home.DiCaprio plays a character so outsized and amoral you may forget that earlier this year he was the title star of The Great Gatsby a guy who partied almost as hard as Belmont (except maybe for the dwarf-tossing) yet who had romantic angst fuelling his high living.Theres no such nobility in his Belmont or even much of a message to his actions although the real Belmont describes his memoirs as a ""cautionary tale ... (for) anyone who think theres anything glamorous about being known as a Wolf of Wall Street.""The moral of the movie seems to be that the most crooked members of the financial community really dont possess much of a conscience if that comes as news to anyone.DiCaprio is happy to be the lead man on Scorseses coaster ride through hell and were all invited along. They promise youll feel happily smoked and only slightly scorched as you exit through the gift shop.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Martin Scorseses The Wolf of Wall Street is outrageous an offense against modesty a shameless celebration of bad conduct. Based on the memoir of convicted stock swindler Jordan Belfort (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) its a blistering caricature of the ethical rot that led to the Wall Street crash of 2008. Also its a really funny comedy. And at three hours running time its an exorbitantly long comedy. Think the mock-epic picaresque novels of Henry Fielding (Tom Jones) or Laurence Sterne (Tristram Shandy). Or in more modern terms Scarface meets Dennis the Menace. Wolf is discernibly a companion piece to Scorseses mid-career criminal biographies Casino and Goodfellas movies made before the most influential American director of the past half-century decided to get responsible and Oscar-conscious (The Departed Hugo) Welcome back Mr. Scorsese your sardonic Mr. Hyde side has been missed. Video Video Five must-see movies to add to your list this holiday After an opening which slyly bleeds into the pre-movie ads we catch a brief glimpse of the reality of a typical afternoon at Belforts brokerage firm A dwarf-tossing contest with fistfuls of cash being flung into the air by the howling employees.A beat later in DiCaprios mellow voiceover we are offered a description of the extremely high life enjoyed by Jordan Belfort multimillionaire idiot playboy degenerate snorting cocaine off a prostitutes behind getting fellated while screaming down the highway in his white Lamborghini (""like Don Johnsons in Miami Vice"") and drugged-out to the point of nodding nearly crashing a helicopter on the lawn of his multimillion-dollar Long Island estate.Who is this stooge and why is he a hero in his own mind? Dont worry Jordan will tell us in flashback starting when as a 22-year-old baby broker he gets his first job on Wall Street at the white-shoe brokerage firm of L.F. Rothschild. Here hes immersed in the obscene language and cutthroat culture of the trading floor. He meets his mentor a senior broker (Matthew McConaughey) who takes him out for a martini and cocaine lunch complete with wise advice (masturbate frequently to relieve stress; take coke to stay focused) and a chest-thumping tribal chant to the voracious Lord of Money.The year is 1987 and shortly after Jordan gets his broker licence its Black Monday. Goodbye job goodbye L.F. Rothschild. In desperation he ends up at a penny-stock boiler-room operation working out of a strip mall selling ""garbage to garbage men"" for a 50-per-cent commission.In no time Jordan has set up his own operation adopted the phony-tony company name Stratton Oakmont and turned his team of dropouts and drug dealers into a sales force and personal cult. Their specialty is ""pump and dump"" operations artificially hyping stocks and then dumping them just before the inevitable downturn. His sidekick is Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill) a Jewish WASP wannabe in tortoise-shell horn-rims and sweaters tied around the neck who shares Jordans passion for all forms of debauchery.Scorsese and his Boardwalk Empire collaborator screenwriter Terence Winter avoid anything that resembles moralizing though often theres a sickly kicker to these scenes that undermines Jordans enthusiastic voiceover narration. In an office orgy sequence (quoting a similar scene in Citizen Kane) an assistant is paid to shave her head and while half-naked bodies are tumbling around her we see the woman wincing as her hair falls away. Jordans second marriage to a Barbie-doll lingerie model (Margot Robbie) is consumated in ""a fairy-tale wedding"" in Vegas - right after the groom gets rid of the STDs he contracted at his bachelor party.Excess is both the theme and the filmmaking approach here. The Wolf of Wall Street is bloated Individual sequences are filmed brilliantly (Scorseses employment of freeze-frames slow-motion and tracking shots still puts his many imitators to shame) but overextended. One exhausting scam and disaster follows another. When you ask will someone say enough is enough - which perhaps is what capitalism gone wild is all about.What keeps the energy percolating is DiCaprios performance in the loosest and most charismatic turn of his career. The character is a moral idiot but his sheer irrepressibility is almost a virtue. Hes a kind of twisted evangelist who preaches to his congregation of hucksters that the religion of capitalism is not about saving souls but finding marks to screw over.Dont worry Theres also a good guy here though he takes a while to show up. Thats FBI agent Patrick Denham (Kyle Chandler) who as seen by Jordan is one of those underpaid schnooks who needs to punish those with more imagination and courage than himself. In one of the movies several indelible sequences Jordan invites the cop onto his yacht. The entire scene is a beautiful little one-act play of gamesmanship and shifting status between the two men.At the other end of the spectrum theres a physical-comedy sequence that seems destined to live on in the annals of slapstick. Jordan and Donnie have a delayed reaction to some extra-strength Quaaludes which leads to Jordans epic slow-motion journey from a country-club lobby to the drivers seat of his Testarossa and a subsequent battle for control of a telephone thats on par with Jacobs wrestling match with the angel.Like everything in The Wolf of Wall Street its all too too much; for my part I couldnt get enough of it Report Typo/Error Follow Liam Lacey on Twitter liamlacey More Related to this Story Geoff Pevere Scorseses creative alliance with DiCaprio No nomination for Oprah and more movie surprises from the Golden Globes The Wolf of Wall Street The mighty shouldnt monkey around Comments Print /License AA In the know Life This woman became a middle-age man magnet.

Running time 2 hours 59 minutes Playing Opens Dec. 25 throughout Orange County (See theaters and movie times)The quick hitThis sprawling mock epic about a sleazy penny stock whiz contains scenes of astonishing black-comic brilliance but its also solipsistic and exhausting. Grade B Jordan Belforts memoir the source book for Martin Scorseses wild new movie (also called ""The Wolf of Wall Street"") reminds me of tell-all football memoirs and novels from 40 years ago. It brings no-holds-bared machismo to a closed hothouse environment. In Belforts case it was the ""boiler room"" of his penny stock investment company Stratton Oakmont which became a cesspit of fraudulent business practices and top-down debauchery in the 1990s. The movie Scorsese has made from the book overflows with unzipped braggadocio self-exposure thats at once aggrandizing and incriminating and drug comedy that does for coke and Quaaludes what ""Up in Smoke"" did for doobies. (Reportedly Tommy Chong encouraged Belfort to write the book.) Its entertaining - and wearying especially at a near-three hour running time. But whenever youre about to give up on it some patch of energizing effrontery bizarre slapstick or unexpected eloquence keeps pulling you back in. Belfort himself played with Brando-like bravura and Jerry Lewis-like elasticity by Leonardo DiCaprio is the fulcrum of the movie. He narrates with a frankness thats initially disarming. He tells us that he knew selling stocks was the job for him from the first day he experienced the roar of profanity and the rush of profiteering when he was a ""connector"" making phone contacts for Wall Street salesmen. He may look like a fresh-faced kid but the chance to score big money from exploiting low appetites proves irresistible. Its only a matter of time before his penchant for testosterone-fueled salesmanship takes over his entire life. The one bump in his path to vainglory is that his first day selling stocks on Wall Street is almost his last day as a broker - Black Monday October 19 1987 which marked the biggest percentage drop in Wall Street history. The way the movie tells it Belfort is ready to work in an electronics store when his first wife suggests that he check out an ad for a Long Island stock company. It turns out to be a strip mall storefront where phone salesmen cold-call clients to sell penny stocks that are worthless except to the salesman who net 50 percent of each transaction. The scene in which Belfort uses his Wall Street-generated slick to pull off a mammoth sale sets the stage for Belforts emergence as a magnetic guru of the hard sell. He astonishes the declasse grunts surrounding him who might as well be hawking Veg-O-Matics. He soon gets the idea that hed make more money pitching penny stocks to the wealthy than to middle-class or working-class people. Then he realizes that hungry kids aching to make a buck rather than business school grads gunning to land in a white shoe firm would be his ideal followers. All they must do is follow his scripts and put them across with the ardor he demands at his adrenaline-pumping pep rallies. At their best Scorsese and screenwriter Terence Winter toy with their antiheros charisma. They challenge the audience to shake him off when he makes outrageous claims. For example Belfort declares that the company he founds on Long Island is Ellis Island. It depends on how you interpret the meaning of ""the wretched refuse of your teeming shores."" Belfort keeps his minions desperate to prove themselves and stoked on rivalry. He creates an anything-goes environment with rabid office high jinks - midget-tossing competitions id-charging antics with several levels of hookers (from high-class to diseased) and naturally ubiquitous drug use. Calling Belfort the smartest man in the room would be to flatter him. He is the shrewdest as well as the most debauched. The movies fascination comes from seeing how far he will degenerate as his cravings define him. One look at the statuesque Naomi (Margot Robbie) and thats it for his long-suffering spouse the bright steadfast Teresa (Cristin Milioti). But he cant be a one-woman man with Naomi either. In fact his one lasting relationship is with his right-hand man and best drug buddy played cleverly by Jonah Hill as a guy whos not as sharp as he thinks he is. Long stretches of this film play come off like a ribald coke-and-Quaalude drug comedy. The most original upsetting and hilarious sequence depicts Belfort drugged senseless striving to get back to his mansion from a country club pay phone before his pal spills incriminating evidence over a tapped line. No filmmaker since Hitchcock has been as skilled as Scorsese at subjective camerawork and cutting - film craft that pulls the audience inside the heart and head of a character. Its both thrilling and funny to watch him and his virtuoso collaborators cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto and editor Thelma Schoonmaker use sinuous camera moves and abrupt changes in scale and perspective to chart the vertiginous gap between Belforts addled perceptions and reality. But Scorseses choice to limit his perspective almost exclusively to Belforts leaves the movie gasping for breath. Near the beginning Matthew McConaughey as his mentor spouts much of the same super-salesman ethos in a riotously mysterious way - in just a couple of scenes he fully renders a man who uses hedonism to get through a business he despises. Midway through Kyle Chandler as a true-blue FBI agent punctures Belforts self-image as a genius by underplaying his own savvy and playing off the rich mans arrogance. Chandler embodies the kind of American hero Belfort despises the man who gets satisfaction from performing a job well and with integrity. The movie could have used more of these two men as well as other characters who could have put the gaudy Belfort into stark relief. He becomes a motivational speaker presenting cutthroat capitalism as the true American way but we dont get to know either the people he inspires or the ones he victimizes. At the end theres nothing left to him and to the movie but hot air. Contact the writer msragowocregister.com Most Popular U.S. Open of Surfing Will you marry me?

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet ""This is obscene"" stammers Max Belfort (Rob Reiner) upon first glimpse of his sons empire the spacious Long Island office where Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his team of cold-calling brokers work and play. ""Obscene"" as it turns out is practically a polite euphemism for how these crooks live--for the lucrative swindle they pull on their clueless clients and for the endless orgies of drugs and hookers that otherwise occupy their time. Theres a lot of sense in Martin Scorsese our premier cinematic authority on American sin bringing this real-life tale of greed and hedonism to the screen. But who could have predicted that hed turn it into a flat-out comedy one as boldly excessive as the lives it chronicles?At three hours The Wolf Of Wall Street is Scorseses longest movie (barely edging out Casino). Its also his crassest his loudest maybe his funniest--an aggressively broad satire of American ambition the full meal to which Spring Breakers Pain amp; Gain and The Bling Ring were merely appetizers. Such reckless indulgence provides the director his own excuse to indulge and Wolf pushes his showboating stylistic tics and love for loutish behavior to the edge of their acceptable limits. But theres a cracked logic a genius almost to the films amped-up irreverence. Maybe laughter isnt just the best medicine but the only sensible response to this much brazen amorality.From Travis Bickle to Jake La Motta to the Italian and Irish gangsters of his crime epics Scorsese has always been hooked on bad boys. And Belfort the founder of shady brokerage firm Stratton Oakmont may be the baddest of them all. No he never murders anyone (though he comes close at least once) but in his ruthless consumption--his endless need for more fixes more women more everything--he may be the most unscrupulous character Martys ever built a movie around. Introduced as a green stockbroker devoted to actually making his clients money (the naivete) Belfort quickly falls under the influence of a slick superior (Matthew McConaughey). In the first of many long baggy dialogue scenes this mentor figure initiates his young protege into the pack. Suitably inspired Belfort masters the sucker sell later starting his own firm and surrounding himself with a posse of moldable lowlifes. Stratton Oakmont would in real life become one of the largest brokerage houses in the country through both fraud and bullying sales tactics. (It was the inspiration for Boiler Room which looks like an Ingmar Bergman film compared to this mad opus.)The Wolf Of Wall Street finds Scorsese slipping back into Goodfellas and Casino mode using Belforts revealing autobiography as the template for another sprawling true-crime saga. But while the years-spanning narrative and chronic voice-over recall those earlier hits Wolf is less interested in the nitty gritty of Belforts bad business than in his monstrous ego and appetites. Stringing together an endless series of blow-out parties the film occasionally approaches the barbed insanity of William Kleins Mr. Freedom especially when Belfort is pumping up his army of loyal employees. Scorsese seems pumped too His film kicks down the fourth wall takes fevered digressions (like a short history of the Quaalude) and features a mind-reading showdown between Belfort and a sneaky Swiss banker (Jean Dujardin from The Artist). Any doubt that this is a capital-C comedy basically evaporates the moment Scorsese cuts to the protagonist and his sexpot second wife (Margot Robbie) literally screwing on a bed of money.As in The Departed theres the occasional sense that Scorsese should have reined in his actors a little more. (Though Jonah Hill hilarious as the right-hand degenerate basically masters the art of the riff.) What keeps Wolf together even when its threatening to collapse under the weight of too many improvisational conversations or destructive drug trips is the actor in the lead. Proving yet again that he does his best work under Martys direction DiCaprio channels all of his star power--the heartthrob charisma he once resisted in the wake of Titanics success--into this vacuous anti-hero. Its a performance that plays brilliantly on his celebrity and his ageless good looks while also building to an early-Pacino-like intensity during the mighty motivational speeches. The scene on a yacht in which Belfort attempts to bribe the FBI agent (Kyle Chandler) watching his every move is a triumph of verbal warfare. And in the movies deliriously funny highpoint Belfort misjudges the potency of some ancient Quaaludes his whole body giving out on him at a moment of urgent crisis. DiCaprios pathetic spirited attempts to crawl to his car reveal an untapped gift for physical comedy. Theres no shame in being repelled by all of this relentless debauchery especially considering the guilty gleeful pleasure Scorsese--ever the conflicted Catholic--seems to take in it. (Scenes in which the brokers beat the shit out of Belforts gay butler or discuss the logistics of ""midget tossing"" are much too humorous to qualify as disapproving.) But as far back as Taxi Driver which looks in the wrong light like an endorsement of vigilante justice Scorsese has approached indefensible people with a mixture of fascination and disgust. The Wolf Of Wall Street just locates a black absurd humor in that comingling of feelings. Anyway its hard to see anything celebratory in the films Goodfellas-style upshot exemplified by Belforts insistence that ""There are no friends on Wall Street."" In the end hes more rodent than canine but The Rat Of Wolf Street just doesnt have the same ring.

Still loved the flick but it is long and the economy of the story could have been flushed out by shortening DiCaprios shouting scenes in his expensive suits to the brokers floor once they had their glass offices. There were three or four of those scenes all too long. Some of the drug scenes with him and Johana Hill could have been trimmed as well. What makes the picture is some of the clever writing and character tight interaction even with bit characters. More of that should have been sprinkled in to freshen up the story rather than DiCaprios and Hills long monologues and drug moments. Yelling works in cinema but after awhile it looses its effect and wares the viewer down.

At this point ""white Wall Street conmen experience meteoric rise and disgraceful plummet as accompanied by prostitutes and drugs; cause us to question our own social values"" isnt new ground to tread. In a year where we had some pretty cool and unusual things happening in mainstream cinema (an animated ""princess"" movie where the most important relationship was between two sisters a space thriller whose face was a middle-aged woman a high-grossing action movie starring a young woman a sci-fi blockbuster where 2/3 leads were NOT white men a female buddy-cop movie) this just seems....tired. And honestly nothing in this movie asks any questions that havent been asked a million times in similar explorations. Lets celebrate Progress not Excess. DeeJaysaid on Sunday January 26 2014 11400 AMI would have to agree this movie is great just a bit to long... I enjoyed it. The best was Jonah hill acting like a complete jackass at times. B+ Mikesaid on Monday December 30 2013 114722 AMDiCaprio is excellent (as usual). Jonah Hill is very good too. Thats saying a lot for me because I ma not a fan of Jonah Hill. For the most part I agree completely with Richard here. The movie is way too long and after a while you get worn down by watching this group of criminals in their excess and periods of self destruction. I would give this movie a B instead of a B+.

"Scorseses Wolf of Wall Street starring Leonardo DiCaprio reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up The Wolf of Wall Street A 180-Minute Party Montage From Martin Scorsese The Wolf of Wall Street A 180-Minute Party Montage From Martin Scorsese Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 23 2013 516 PM The Wolf of Wall Street Epic in size claustrophobically narrow in scope. By Dana Stevens Leonardo DiCaprio Jon Bernthal Jonah Hill Margot Robbie and pure decadence star in The Wolf of Wall Street. Photo courtesy Mary Cybulski/Paramount Pictures Remember that scene in The Wolf of Wall Street when Leonardo DiCaprio (as the crooked stockbroker Jordan Belfort) and Jonah Hill (as his right-hand man and chief enabler Donnie Azoff) do an obscene amount of drugs and ostentatiously throw around their swindled millions and just generally act like complete amoral tools? No the other one. No the other other one. The truth is that description fits nearly every scene in this three-hour-long movie. Epic in size but claustrophobically narrow in scope The Wolf of Wall Street maintains a near-exclusive focus on the greed and self-indulgence of its proudly rapacious hero. Sometimes in voice-over sometimes directly addressing the camera Jordan narrates his and Donnies booze-and-Quaalude-fueled monkeyshines (which range from snorting drugs out of a hookers ass to throwing dwarfs-for-hire at a Velcro target board) in a cocky self-satisfied tone. Hindsight and jail time it seems have done nothing to tarnish Belforts memories of how awesome it was to be young high and rich with other peoples money. Mind you this is not to suggest that Belforts amorality is in itself a fault of The Wolf of Wall Street. Unredeemed jerks can make for transfixing movie heroes (and DiCaprio has played not a few such characters from the slippery trickster of Catch Me If You Can to the shirt-tossing profligate of The Great Gatsby). But Scorsese and Terence Winter (the Emmy-winning Sopranos writer who adapted Belforts memoir for the screen) overestimate the audiences ability or desire to watch Leo misbehave. The storys relentless unvarying rhythm--malfeasance consumption more malfeasance more consumption--leaves the audience drained and annoyed. Theres a comic/horrific set piece late in the movie in which Jordan too zonked on ludes to form a coherent sentence literally drags himself on his belly to his waiting sports car for a very ill-advised drive home from his country club. Coming as the culmination of a well-shaped storyline about Jordans mounting drug addiction and self-destructiveness this scene might have been as bleakly funny as Scorsese (judging by how lovingly he documents every second of that crawl) seems to find it. But given that weve been watching this man get wasted and do stupid stuff for the past two hours already Jordans arduous car crawl merely seems like an amplified (and endless) replay of whats come before--for example the early scene in which Donnie and Jordan play hooky from their job trading penny stocks at a low-rent Long Island brokerage firm to try out a promising new street drug called ""crack."" I dont mean to suggest that no coherent narrative worms its way into the 180-minute party montage that is The Wolf of Wall Street. The best scenes involve Jordans attempts to stay just out of reach of the FBI agent Patrick Denham (a blessedly understated Kyle Chandler) whos trying to gather enough evidence to nail Jordan on insider trading tax evasion or whatever he can get. The films single strongest moment happens during a cat-and-mouse conversation between the two men that takes place on board Jordans cartoonishly luxurious yacht. (It has a helipad complete with helicopter.) While Jordan drops broad hints about bribery--he understands the hardships of working in law enforcement he could find ways to make Denhams life easier etc.--the canny agent lies in wait for his mark to say something explicitly incriminating. This yacht scene crackles with the macho gamesmanship and latent violence that Scorsese so deftly explored in Goodfellas--a film this one resembles for the most part only superficially. Top Comment Thank you for watching it so I dont have to.  More... -nerdpocalypse Join In Advertisement The Australian actress Margot Robbie who has the brittle impossible prettiness of a life-sized Barbie makes the most of her underwritten role as the ""Duchess of Bay Ridge"" the outer-borough beauty who seduces Jordan away from his first wife. A scene where she sexually humiliates her husband in front of their babys crib only to become the victim of Jordans turnabout nasty trick points at the dark domestic comedy this could have been had Scorsese spent more screen time developing that relationship. Instead there are a lot--a lot--of chemically enhanced dude-bonding scenes between DiCaprio and Hill in between stylishly edited montages of churning stock tickers ecstatic trading floors and writhing strippers. Thelma Schoonmaker Scorseses longtime editor makes these individual fragments of storytelling feel kinetic and propulsive (aided by the soundtrack of pop jazz and blues songs by everyone from Billy Joel to Cannonball Adderley.) But even the best editing cant create story out of a vacuum and the world as Scorsese lets us glimpse it through Jordan Belforts eyes is pretty vacuous. I suspect that Scorsese chose to tell the story of Belforts late-80s/early-90s rise and fall as a commentary on the 2008 crash but its not clear what comment is being offered since the only affect available to the viewer after the second straight hour of gonzo young-banker high jinks is a numb combination of boredom disgust and (I guess if you aspire to snort coke out of prostitutes bums and mistreat your yacht captain) envy. Unlike the hapless marks that Jordan and Donnie sweet-talk into buying penny stocks I just cant bring myself to invest. Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic.

The movie is based on a memoir of the same title by the Wall Street scoundrel Jordan Belfort who cheated his clients out of tens of millions of dollars ratted on his friends and was indicted and jailed for securities fraud and money-laundering. Set in the period from the mid-eighties to the aughts its a three-hour-long satire of loathsome financial activity and extravagant debauchery and its meant to epitomize everything that has gone wrong with money culture. Scorsese employs a flexible narrative form and a free-swinging style of filming. (Rodrigo Prieto is the cinematographer.) The camera plunges into groups of stockbrokers cleaving their numbers as Moses did the Red Sea; it swings over them and then swings back like some video-enhanced boomerang. ""Wolf"" has great giddy moments and Terence Winter (""Boardwalk Empire"") who did the adaptation creates flurries of raucously cynical dialogue that hit you like a rapid series of jabs. Leonardo DiCaprio puts his voice his body and his handsome face which he contorts into a grimace into what is certainly his largest performance yet. But the entire movie feels manic and forced as though Scorsese is straining to make the craziest most over-the-top picture ever--as if he is determined at seventy-one to outdo his earlier triumphs ""Raging Bull"" and ""GoodFellas"" and to show that hes still the king. Put crudely this is his attempt to out-Tarantino Tarantino. I didnt much care for ""Wolf"" but every time I describe it to someone he says ""I want to see that"" Many people are going to be made happy by the wild hyper-vulgar exuberance the endless cruddy behavior (swindling drugs whoring orgies dwarf-tossing more swindling) and the fully staged excess of every kind. To adopt the idiom and the tone of the movie Are you fucking kidding me? Are you telling me that youre bored by big money? By orgies? By monster yachts? Are you saying you dont like looking at beautiful naked blondes? Is that what youre fucking telling me? Three hours of that kind of hectoring. The film as you can see is a bit of a trap for critics. Scorsese mounts the filthy piggish behavior on such a grand scale that mere moral disapproval might seem squeamish unimaginative frightened. Most of us after all wouldnt dare screw up as badly as Jordan Belfort. The movie has a bullying tone and you have to come back at it. All right then I myself am not squeamish and Ive done my own share of screwing up financially and yet I found plenty of room in my heart for disgust and even for boredom. ""Wolf"" is delivered almost all the way through at the same pitch of extreme aggression. Its relentless deafening deadening and finally unilluminating. As the critic Farran Smith Nehme pointed out to me one of the filmmakers mistakes was to take Jordan Belforts claims at face value. In his memoir Belfort presents himself as a very big deal on Wall Street. The movie presents him the same way--as a thieving Wall Street revolutionary--whereas in fact he was successful but relatively small time. From the beginning ""Wolf"" feels inflated self-important. DiCaprios Jordan Belfort comes right at us narrating directly to the camera like a low-rent Richard III. He takes us into his confidence pitching his life story to us--we might be one of his clients. As he talks ""Wolf"" develops the rise-and-fall shape of a gangster movie like Scorseses marvellous ""GoodFellas"" which too is narrated by its hero played by Ray Liotta. But we never develop any empathy for Jordan nor do we identify with him as we did with Liottas Henry Hill. The narration has such an unremittingly boastful tone that the response is often ""What a jerk."" Jordans story is an up-from-nowhere tale. He gets into a Wall Street firm in the eighties passes his Series 7 exam and becomes a broker only to run into the crash of October 19 1987 when the Dow Jones Industrial Average drops by twenty-three per cent in a single day. He gets thrown out of work and winds up in a boiler room in a Long Island shopping center where demoralized schlubs pitch ridiculous penny stocks to easily excited clients--garbage men appear to be especially gullible. Jordan who particularly excels at pump-and-dump schemes takes over the place soon enough and in company with Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill) a former furniture salesman he starts his own company on Wall Street Stratton Oakmont an actual company which did actual stock-brokering and committed various treacheries. (The company no longer exists.) At this point the movie lurches wildly into excess. Again and again as Jordan stands in front of his legion of brokers mic in hand DiCaprio arches his back and winds himself up as if hes about to fling a shot put; he drops his voice nearly swallows the mic then shouts like James Brown at the Apollo. He preaches the gospel of winning killing triumphing. Scorsese gives him three long motivational speeches each one working up to a hysterical high. As performance theyre amazing if you prize brazen overacting. But what is the point of Jordan saying the same thing three times? By the end of the first speech my teeth ached. Marty we get it Gordon Gekko was wrong. Greed--the surprise here is overwhelming--is bad intoxicating corrupting destroying. On the trading floor the brokers flip the bird at clients as they talk to them on the phone. Were invited to enjoy how contemptuous they are of anyone whom they can bully cozen or blarney out of money. Listening to Jordans speeches these brokers (women as well as men) go nuts cheering and pumping their fists like a crowd at a Fascist rally. They come off as fools manipulators who it turns out are very easily manipulated themselves working their butts off to make Jordan rich. The speeches and the responses to them leave you with a queasy feeling; you can hardly react the way the brokers do. Instead you can only shrink down in your seat battered. The first speech is capped by a trading-floor orgy in which a naked male marching band parades its way onto the floor followed by a procession of naked hookers. The girls wrestle out-of-shape brokers to the floor or straddle them on desks. It sure is whoopee time. (When money is around were meant to think everyone gets laid.) There are additional orgies later staged with such demented physical vigor that they might be part of a Broadway musical. At times Scorsese seems to be directing a knock-the-tourists-dead show called ""Greed"" Hundred-dollar bills which Jordan peels from an oversize roll flutter through the air like snowflakes. Quaaludes ingested in bulk slow Jordan and Donnie down until they fall into a drooling paralyzed trance. Naked blondes keep showing up. The point of course is that the men who sling them around are pigs but Scorsese doesnt get anything out of the actresses. Theyre just bodies and hes using them too. Everything is pushed to the edge of mania and disintegration. Satire presented this broadly ceases to have any instructive or cleansing effect. It becomes burlesque--lewd vaunting and self-promoting--and you can get excited by it and feel slightly soiled at the same time. Its not only the trading-floor and debauchery scenes that are directed in this overwrought way; Jordan and Donnie and their cronies in the Stratton Oakmont inner circle gather together and pelt every subject that comes up with profanity some of it funny some of it just repetitive and show-off raw. Scene after scene explodes into an obscene fight or an obscene mock-fight staged with all of Scorseses stunning energy and pounding-temples anxiety. There are so many noisy moments like this that the movie has no possible climax--or it has so many climaxes that it seems like one almost continuous fit. Hysteria is not a very productive dramatic mode. The few times that Scorsese releases his choke hold on the audience he produces some fine moments and at least two classic set pieces. At Jordans first brokerage job Matthew McConaughey playing the top broker Mark Hanna explains the facts of life Never work for the client always work for yourself. Dont let the client cash in his winnings argue him into reinvesting and take the commission. McConaughey who has been on a roll of his own in recent years speeds up his Texas drawl which somehow makes the sleazy advice even more potent. As McConaughey instructs holding up a little vial of cocaine and caressing the air DiCaprio listens closely and you can actually see Jordan learning. At that instant he comes across as extremely intelligent even appealing. Afterward hes hardly an imaginable or a bearable human being. The second great scene a long serious confrontation between Jordan and a straight-arrow F.B.I. agent Patrick Denham (Kyle Chandler from ""Friday Night Lights"") who is Jordans Inspector Javert pursuing him for years. They meet on Jordans hundred-and-seventy-foot yacht in New York harbor. A sober fellow Patrick is meant to represent not just the law but also moral sanity and decency. Jordan who buys everything and everyone sees in Patrick a guy who rides the subway--a loser--and he makes the mistake of underestimating him. Scorsese creates Patrick as fully equal to Jordan in guile and determination and Kyle Chandler a formidable actor puts layers of amusement and contempt into his work. As the two men talk grinning and putting each other on wrapping insults in suave flattery the scene develops what the rest of the movie doesnt have undertones. Scorsese has always understood the way that men try to outmaneuver and dominate each other. If there were more moments like that the movie might have been as fine as ""GoodFellas."" But in general Scorsese wears his performers out with noisy redundant material. Casting off his helpful first wife (Cristin Milioti) Jordan acquires as wife No. 2 a slender blonde Naomi (Margot Robbie) just as he acquires an enormous house on Long Islands Gold Coast and the yacht. The marital fights are depressingly banal; weve seen these screaming violent conflicts in many movies before including a few by Scorsese. Does he think can make them fresh by turning up the volume? The pouting Margot Robbie tries hard but shes no match for Jennifer Lawrence who has a similar role in ""American Hustle"" as well as a much better script. As Donnie Jonah Hill grinning with shiny new choppers is amusing at first but he is forced to overdraw on what he can do. The performance doesnt grow it just repeats. DiCaprio who keeps selling rather than acting his character is the ultimate victim of Scorseses over-driven vitalism. You feel like youre being back-thumped into admiring his version of Jordans self-presentation. In all he gives one of the most completely externalized performances in the history of the movies. Everything is big and he turns himself inside out physically. Writhing and then crawling on the floor in a quaalude overdose he rivals Lon Chaney in his contortions. (The physical excess in its stupid way is meant to be heroic though no one could punish his body as much as Jordan Belfort does and continue to look like Leonardo DiCaprio.) DiCaprio has enormous physical range but the performance is spiritually constrained. Jordan lacks complexity contradiction insight. No doubt there are terrible people on Wall Street but its naive to put a man this limited at the center of a three-hour-long epic. Illumination never arrives. ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a fake. Its meant to be an expose of disgusting immoral corrupt obscene behavior but its made in such an exultant style that it becomes an example of disgusting obscene filmmaking. Its actually a little monotonous; spectacular and energetic beyond belief but monotonous in the way that all burlesques become monotonous after a while.

"Wolf of Wall Street movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - Chicago Tribune Arts amp; Entertainment Arts amp; Entertainment Review Wolf of Wall Street  Wolf of Wall Street Mary Cybulski/Paramount Pictures Jonah Hill and Leonardo DiCaprio in ""Wolf of Wall Street."" Jonah Hill and Leonardo DiCaprio in ""Wolf of Wall Street."" (Mary Cybulski/Paramount Pictures) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Privacy Policy In the waning years of the last century at Stratton Oakmont the Wall Street brokerage house run like a coked-up 24-hour bacchanal by Jordan Belfort the customer wasnt king. The customer was merely a means to an end. Belfort and his minions ruled and they couldnt spend snort or swallow the riches reaped fast enough.Belforts various illegalities and near-death experiences were lovingly self-chronicled in his memoirs. Now director Martin Scorsese has made a three-hour picture about the man and his pleasure missions. Leonardo DiCaprio reteams with Scorsese for a fifth time and late in ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" theres a sequence when Belfort and his friend and up-from-the-streets colleague played by Jonah Hill ingest fistfuls of Quaaludes and feeling nothing take a few more. This leads to a massive delayed reaction and a nearly incapacitating mess of lost motor function slurred speech seriously impaired driving and a steadily building comic set piece that nearly saves the movie. Theres something missing from ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" though. Scorseses camera energizes all he can in every way he can as a propulsive filmmaker. But around the 80-minute mark the bullet train of a protagonist begins to run in circles however maniacally. The movies benumbed by its own parade of bad behavior. Like some of Scorseses other second-tier works -- ""Casino"" ""Bringing Out the Dead"" -- the gulf between virtuoso technical facility and impoverished material cannot be bridged. Its diverting sort of to see DiCaprio doing lines off a strippers posterior but after the 90th time its like enough already with heinous capitalistic extremes.Adapting screenwriter Terence Winter intends Belforts story to be an increasingly galling cautionary tale but without the overt finger-wagging that would bring in the bring-down. Although DiCaprio is never less than engaged I wonder if the comfort level between this actor and this director has begun to work against both artists. Perhaps its simply that DiCaprio has already played a (very different) man of blinkered excess in a similarly exhausting picture this year Baz Luhrmanns ""The Great Gatsby."" But no matter how many whirligig variations DiCaprio and company pull in ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" the films relentlessness becomes monotonous. In one scene the federal agent (Kyle Chandler) who smells a rat visits Belfort on his yacht -- a yacht as DiCaprio reminds him that is ""fit for a Bond villain."" Its an interesting scene for a while with the adversaries sniffing each other out pushing each others buttons. And then it goes on two minutes too long.

Photo Credit MCT advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The drug-fueled sex-crazed life of Long Island-based financial fraudster Jordan Belfort. Rated R (sex drug use language) BOTTOM LINE Martin Scorseses epic tale of debauchery feels overlong and sometimes misses its mark but its the directors raunchiest funniest film yet. CAST Leonardo DiCaprio Jonah Hill Margot Robbie LENGTH 259 ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" a tale of unchecked greed and excess is a movie of superlatives. Its Martin Scorseses longest at 179 minutes and also his raunchiest with more sex and debauchery than any other hes made. Soon to be famous for showing Leonardo DiCaprio holding a lit candle with no hands ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is the closest Scorsese has come to making an out-and-out comedy. DiCaprio plays financial fraudster Jordan Belfort whose fusty-sounding firm Stratton Oakmont was actually a pump-and-dump boiler room in Lake Success. A good one too -- by the age of 26 Belfort was earning nearly 3 million a week enough to acquire a Ferrari and a centerspread-worthy wife Naomi (Margot Robbie). As for his victims Belfort tells us ""Their money was better off in my pockets. I knew how to spend it better."" Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Scorsese shows us exactly how Belfort spent it on drugs prostitutes and lavish parties often right in the office with his equally depraved colleagues. ""Wolf"" based on Belforts post-prison memoir (Kyle Chandler plays the FBI agent who quietly gets his man) wants to paint an emblematic portrait of Wall Street hubris. This however is where Scorseses movie misses its mark. The mayhem truth be told isnt terribly shocking. The atmosphere feels whimsical with midgets and marching bands -- less Caligula than Fellini. There are a lot of these visually jumbled and high-volume scenes (DiCaprio often screams until hes beet red) and they quickly grow repetitive. Belfort also seems like the wrong poster boy for todays problems and not just because he comes from the long-ago 1990s. Hes a street kid a common criminal whereas the millionaires who fleeced America in 2008 did so legally. Those stories have yet to be compellingly told in the movies; Belfort is merely an entertaining scapegoat. 214 MoviesThe Wolf of Wall Street trailer ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" has some fine performances particularly from Jonah Hill as Donnie Azoff (loosely based on real-life Stratton staffer Danny Porush) a toothy accountant whose drug habit turns him into a kind of nebbish Hulk. Hill and DiCaprio run through a Quaalude-induced slapstick routine that may become a minor classic.

Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Friday December 20 2013 1049 PM Talk about a high-risk reward. Martin Scorseses ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a delirious manic push-the-limits comedy of gaudy amorality that tests the audiences taste. But its a gamble that works since you leave this adrenaline trip wasted but invigorated. That also describes Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) as he arrives in the Manhattan financial world. A 25-year-old Queens kid eager to get rich Belfort is a lamb with fangs. His meat business has gone belly-up and hes hungry. His hopped-up mentor (Matthew McConaughey seen too briefly) gives him advice Play hard do hard drugs to stay up take harder drugs to go down. The Black Monday market crash of 1987 forces Belfort to work at a rinky-dink Long Island brokerage firm specializing in ""penny stocks"" cheap sells to sucker investors wholl never see a dime. The surroundings may be two-bit but Belfort is all class mesmerizing all around him including Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill) a neighbor impressed by Belforts paychecks. The Wolf of Wall Street is directed by Martin Scorsese. Later at Belforts own firm Stratton Oakmont he Azoff and their frat-boy-ish pals are as depraved as possible while making millions. When Belfort and the equally out-of-control Donnie arent hosting dwarf-tossing contests snorting coke off hookers or crashing helicopters and cars theyre smuggling dirty cash into Switzerland for safekeeping. This conscience-free bull throws his energy into prurient activities the way most of us channel-surf. DiCaprio is up to the challenge. Playing a Wall St. Caligula in Canali suits the almost 40-year-old actor never lets Belforts outlandishness have a whiff of gravitas -- which is a savvy way of making his debauchery even more depraved. Its a richintoxicating performance that reaches a fever pitch whenever Belfort wields a microphone to rally his troops. Hill is also great in a turn that like his Oscar-nominated one in ""Moneyball"" feeds off his average-guy persona. Donnie always had a greedy monster in him and once the genie is free it cant be bottled up -- not even when Belforts accountant dad (Rob Reiner) warns them of too much excess or when a wily FBI agent (Kyle Chandler) starts sniffing around. Leonardo DiCaprio takes the mic in The Wolf of Wall Street. Scorsese working from Terence Winters hyperverbal adaptation of Belforts memoir tones down his peripatetic style. Thats smart -- if the camera were as frenetic as Belfort wed all have heart attacks. Aficionados of the filmmaker will follow the scent from ""The Color of Money"" to ""Goodfellas"" to ""Casino"" to here but this dark comedy almost never shows a victim. Like the Stratton Oakmont guys its in its own world. Only occasionally does it feel myopic. Another flaw Margot Robbie as Belforts sexy but screechy second wife never finds her footing. Still this fast-moving film has a scene everyone will buzz about a groggy fight on a Long Island lawn between Belfort and Azoff both drugged out on copious amounts of bad Quaaludes. Their scuffle is played hilariously like theyre at half-speed. Henry Zebrowski (from left) P.J. Byrne Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill in The Wolf of Wall Street The scene recalls the slow-motion kitchen fight in Scorseses ""Whos That Knocking at My Door"" (1967). Only here its not a gang playing with guns -- its irresponsible young men playing with innocent folks money. We could say they get whats coming to them but Scorseses film definitely gives the thieves the last laugh.

"Review Wolf of Wall Street a decadent gem - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Wolf of Wall Street a decadent gemBy Randy MyersSan Jose Mercury News CorrespondentPosted 12/23/2013 080000 AM PSTUpdated 12/24/2013 020744 PM PST Related StoriesJan 1Jonah Hill goes even more hedonistic for The Wolf of Wall StreetDec 31Leonardo DiCaprio Martin Scorsese defend making The Wolf of Wall StreetDec 26Martin Scorsese heckled at Wolf of Wall Street screeningDec 24Marty and Leo team up again for WolfOn face value Martin Scorseses altogether rude and spunky ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" fits the bill of exploitative junk. A ""Boys in Pinstripes Gone Wild"" if you will that is classed up by a wildfire of a performance from Leonardo DiCaprio playing a real-life Wall Street dealmaker and lawbreaker.Take one look at the hard-R-rated debauchery on display the scenes of excessive partying that lead to tossed-off tops and bottoms. The marathon drug-taking sessions that fuel shady deals and high jinks on yachts and in offices big and shoddy. And the rampant disregard for anything remotely associated with political correctness.All of it comes scandalously gloriously into focus because of the spry-beyond-his-years direction from Scorsese a dead-on screenplay by Terence Winter and the dexterous seamless editing of Thelma Schoonmaker Powell.But Scorseses in-your-face exploration of Wall Street swindling and powertripping isnt a cheesy wallow designed for the raincoat crowd. It has a sharp point to it that stabs at the heart of the American way of moneymaking and at those who worship the mighty dollar and see hucksters like Jordan Belfort (DiCaprio) as soothsayers with a magic formula worth learning from. Few films have so blatantly portrayed the amoral absurdities of Wall Street fat cats like this naughty adults-only ride through the lifestyles of the rich and infamous. If you thought your holiday office parties spun out of control you havent seen anything yet.Advertisement The decadent antics that unspool seem over-the-top but theyre all rooted in reality since ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is based on Belforts best-selling confessional of his flashy ascent and fiery descent as a stockbroker who cofounded New Yorks Stratton Oakmont. The dashing Belfort took nothing and turned it into something by corralling a posse of wanna-get-rich compatriots to help lead others into bad investments during the 1980s and 90s. Soon enough the FBI caught a whiff of what was really going down.DiCaprio is ideal to play a cunning smoothie like Belfort; using that twinkle in his eye and boyish charisma even better than he did as Jay Gatsby. This is his finest three hours of work and his most demanding role yet one that requires him to be raw unhinged and showier than ever. Whether hes on the phone luring someone to send him a check for a dicey investment or flopping around the floor after ingesting too many quaaludes DiCaprio hits the jackpot.Hes not alone. In a small sharply written role Matthew McConaughey is electrifying as coke-snorting mentor Mark Hanna who engages in a bawdy off-the-rails lunch conversation. Funnyman Jonah Hill elicits his usual big laughs as Belforts kooky neighbor and eventual partner Donnie Azoff. And in smaller but essential parts Kyle Chandler makes for formidable FBI foil Patrick Denham while Margot Robbie spices things up as Belforts second trophy wife Naomi.As good as they are theres no doubt this is a two-person show. The partnership of DiCaprio-Scorsese has been a good one including ""The Departed"" and ""Shutter Island."" With ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" its clear that all their work together has created a bond that is yielding some big dividends with the biggest payday coming yet for DiCaprio.

But what happens in a movie when that energy is willfully indiscriminate -- shapeless conscienceless mindless? It becomes an endurance test. Scorseses youngish alter ego Leonardo DiCaprio is the real-life penny stockbroker Jordan Belfort who delivers boastful odes (in voice-over and sometimes right to the camera) to the accumulation of cash sex drugs and real estate. Working from Belforts memoir (the script is by Terence Winter) Scorsese tells the story entirely from his protagonists point of view evidently grooving on Belforts conspicuous consumption and ability to live -- at least for a time -- by his own laws. Maybe a quarter of the movies three hours centers on Belforts attempt to hide his chicanery (and money) from an FBI agent named Denham (Kyle Chandler). The rest is a veritable orgy of immorality each scene making the same point only more and more outrageously the action edited with Scorseses usual manic exuberance but to oh-so-monotonous effect. The trajectory is nothing you havent seen before. Young wide-eyed (too wide-eyed) Belfort arrives on Wall Street and is told hes ""pond scum"" by one of his new bosses. The other (Matthew McConaughey) takes him out to lunch sucks down drink after drink repeatedly thumps his chest and says ""Fuck the clients"" Money cocaine and hookers -- thats what its about. Deep-sixed after 1987s Black Monday Belfort starts over on Long Island in penny stocks and puts that ""fuck the clients"" philosophy into action by selling ""garbage to garbagemen."" (""Their money was better off in my pocket"") Before long he too has cocaine and hookers -- at one point sucking the former from the ass of the latter. And so begins the symphony of sin. Scorsese seems to think that by blowing Belforts book up to three hours hes making an epic statement. But its not as if he shows you the consequences of Belforts actions. The movie has no scope; theres barely enough content for a short. The Wolf of Wall Street is three hours of horrible people doing horrible things and admitting to being horrible. But youre supposed to envy them anyway because the alternative is working at McDonalds and riding the subway alongside wage slaves. What are a few years in a minimum-security prison -- practically a country club -- when you can have the best of everything? In interviews Scorseses brilliant editor Thelma Schoonmaker has said it was hard to cut the film down from four hours. Four hours? As I watched I kept thinking that every scene could be snipped at the halfway point before yet another hot-dog monologue or leering shot of Belforts second wife the startlingly pretty but soulless Naomi the ""Duchess of Bay Ridge"" played by Margot Robbie. I figured Leo must have been sitting in the editing room saying ""No no dont cut here -- my favorite line is coming up -- 30 more seconds -- okay a minute -- wait let it run Its my Oscars scene"" But no this was Scorseses design. Overkill is the ruling aesthetic. DiCaprio certainly aims to kill. He has A-list charisma but his performance is all on the nose -- no shading. Jonah Hill sticks big false teeth into his mouth to play Donnie Belforts zhlubby sidekick -- the dork engorged by power and quickly more brazen than his mentor. Those choppers chew the scenery but Hill has a good quiet moment when Belforts fortunes plummet and Donnie doesnt know how to talk to him. As the FBI nemesis Chandler steals the picture by underplaying. The only scene with a dramatic arc is onboard Belforts yacht when Denham and his partner pay a call. Belfort delivers a spiel in which he hints he can make their lives more comfortable and they sit and listen patiently and give him the tiniest friendly signals to keep talking -- and hang himself. Scorseses go-with-the-immoral-flow strategy makes sense in one respect. The parts of Oliver Stones Wall Street that captured our imagination featured the dastardly Gordon Gekko Who even remembers the ""good father"" a tediously moralizing union man played by Martin Sheen? Why should a filmmaker slow down a movie with sermons saying things we already know? Obviously he or she shouldnt -- that clumsily. But much of what we respond to in a work of art is the distance between the artist and the subject. It can be the subtlest tension between the filmmakers and characters points of view as in Scorseses Taxi Driver where were infected by Travis Bickles insanity but could also stand back from it or GoodFellas where the narrators newfound sense of power wasnt enough to forestall the dread. To make The Wolf of Wall Street Scorsese has had to empty out his head and pound his chest. The movie is thumpingly insipid.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 1226 p.m. EST December 24 2013An unexpectedly funny movie that is also wildly energetic. Di Caprios role -- and the movie as a whole -- embodies the financial opportunism and cutthroat style of the era.Leonardo DiCaprio lives the good life as Jordan Belfort in ""The Wolf of Wall Street.""(Photo Mary Cybulski Paramount Pictures and Red Granite Pictures via AP)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY review 1/2 out of fourStars Leonardo DiCaprio Matthew McConaughey Jonah Hill Kyle ChandlerRated R; Runtime 3 hours; Opens Wednesday nationwideFrom Mean Streets to Wall Street director Martin Scorsese is fascinated by clever one-track-minded slimeballs.And in The Wolf of Wall Street (1/2 out of four; rated R; opens Wednesday nationwide) we share his exuberance.Sharp humor accentuates the free-wheeling energy of Scorseses latest film focused on unscrupulous stockbrokers. Its rambunctious and unruly but mesmerizing. Based on the memoir of multimillionaire Jordan Belfort Wolfs lens is trained on the ubiquity of greed. Like Scorseses After Hours its absurdly funny though more akin to Goodfellas in substance and structure.The story traces the rise and fall of abhorrent market wiz Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his retinue of debauched fellow traders and to a lesser extent the FBI agent (Kyle Chandler) hell-bent on bringing him down.In voice-over narration and in shots where hes often looking directly into the camera Belfort knows no bounds with his drug-addled hubris. From dwarf tossing to smuggling thousands of dollars into Switzerland many of the scenes play like a depraved farce.Belforts all-consuming avarice captures the essence of 90s excess. The company that Belfort builds is essentially a cross between a frat and a cult complete with chest-pounding and chanting. He and his closest henchman Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill with a hilarious set of luminescent fake teeth) ingest insane amounts of controlled substances and bed countless women. Theyre rock stars in the financial world and such indulgence is expected in their orgiastic culture of excess.Hailing from working-class origins Belfort begins his Wall Street career as a decent guy but tutored by a smarmy honcho (Matthew McConaughey) he quickly acquires a sense of entitlement.The stock market crash of 1987 rocks Belforts world but in short order he applies his Wall Street tricks to penny stocks and wields his charm to fleece gullible folks out of their savings. As he grows wealthier he dumps his starter wife (Cristin Milioti) for a trophy spouse (Margot Robbie).Scorsese has made DiCaprio his latter-day muse This is their fifth collaboration. The actors swaggering master-of-the-universe portrayal here is his best performance.When hes indicted for securities fraud and money laundering Belfort only serves three years at a country club prison easily manipulating fellow prisoners with his wealth.And speaking of country clubs a slapstick scene in which Belfort ingests mass quantities of Quaaludes rolls down the stairs of an elegant country club and attempts to drive home is both queasy and giddily amusing.The Wolf of Wall Street examines the twin demons of insatiable desire and corruption in a thoroughly entertaining fashion. Its cynical script by Terence Winter is razor-sharp. And while there are a few too many scenes of maniacal partying the film is captivating despite its three-hour length.Its not entirely clear however if Scorsese is appalled by the bad behavior or merely winking at it. These are repellent people who dont suffer the consequences they deserve. Does the director in some ways admire their all-out audacity? He doesnt delve too deeply into the psyches of these vulgar swindlers. He just offers them up to the audience relentlessly with a distinctively swooping camera and quick edits.The Wolf of Wall Street is epic in scope intoxicating and brimming with vitality -- often disturbingly so. 74 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDIN 9 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1c1tsIj",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/12/22/the-wolf-of-wall-street-review/2941331/,200,thewolfofwallstreet37,thewolfofwallstreet,usatoday

All Rights Reserved. Martin Scorseses The Wolf of Wall Street is the kind of movie directors make when they wield money power and a not inconsiderable degree of arrogance. Sprawling and extravagant it revels in all manner of excess including sexual debauchery hearty abuse of liquor and quaaludes even dwarf-tossing. Its antihero the crooked high-flier Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) has a Dunhill wallet where his heart should be and he just cant stop flinging bills out of it. The movie around him guns for grandeur in the same way There are hints of greatness one or two artfully constructed scenes that remind you why you look forward to new Scorsese films in the first place. But as a highly detailed portrait of true-life corruption and bad behavior in the financial sector Wolf is pushy and hollow too much of a bad thing like a three-hour cold call from the boiler room that leaves you wondering ""What have I just been sold?"" A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Its a work of bullying artistry but at least it looks really expensive. So does DiCaprios Jordan with his wardrobe of bespoke suits and that Crest Whitestrips smile. Jordan is the founder of a 90s-era investment firm with a pseudo-classy name Stratton Oakmont. His cronies among them Jonah Hills perpetually dazed-looking Donnie Azoff start out knowing diddly-squat about finance. Before long theyre bending the rules and bilking ordinary folk out of millions the better to finance mansions yachts and trophy wives -- along with their hookers and drug habits. (The movie was adapted by Terence Winter from Belforts 2007 memoir of the same name.)Scorsese halfheartedly follows a rags-to-riches-to-rags arc though mostly he fixates on riches. Some of the early moments are promising One of the funniest most casual sections features Matthew McConaughey as one of Jordans early mentors earnestly advising the callow newcomer over a multi-martini lunch that in order to be a world beater hell need to start masturbating more. Scorsese doesnt pass judgment on his characters which at first seems like a plus. But he cant get a fix on the tone; the movie has the intentionally sour spirit of Goodfellas but none of its grim humor. Film Details The Wolf of Wall Street RatingR GenreDrama Running Time179 More Info Many of the bits are probably intended to be over-the-top funny and horrifying In one sequence a female Stratton Oakmont employee volunteers to have her head shaved in front of the staff in return for a hefty check which Jordan announces shes going to use for breast implants. She submits cheerfully to the electric shaver but we feel humiliated for her as locks of her lustrous hair fall to the floor. Shes playing the boys game tossing her own currency into the pot but its all just a big guffaw for them.One hour of that boorishness would be more than enough; by the end of the second you might be wondering if anyone including Scorsese is ever going to call these guys on their self-absorbed idiocy. What exactly does he think of these people? His portrayal has no sharpness no skepticism. Long after weve gotten the picture Scorsese and cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto are still presenting each new depraved revelation as if it were an infant water-nymph on a lily pad a thing of wonder theyd never seen before. If youve never heard stories about the boorishness of Wall Street types youll be incredibly shocked by The Wolf of Wall Street. That man snorted coke out of a hookers butt Jordan does eventually fall. His second wife a pneumatic princess he calls the Duchess (Margot Robbie) finally sees what a loser he is as a man if not a pocketbook; the supercilious French dude (Jean Dujardin with his crocodile smile) whos helping him hide his money in Switzerland pulls a fast one on him; and a wily FBI agent -- played by the appealing Kyle Chandler whos starting to resemble a young Robert Forster which is miraculous -- starts sniffing at his all-too-obvious trail. (In real life Belfort was convicted of money laundering and securities fraud and spent 22 months in jail. He now makes a living as a motivational speaker.)But if theres nothing pleasurable or revelatory in watching these guys act like cavemen who have just discovered women drugs and cash its even less fun to see them get caught. DiCaprios Jordan is manic in a studied way; hes always leaping onto desks or writhing on floors. Hes not wholly dislikable -- his brashness has a bright sheen to it like artificial solar power -- but DiCaprios turn might be more effective if he hadnt just played Jay Gatsby in a much better performance earlier this year. Both Gatsby and Jordan are strivers and fakers but Gatsby aspires to elegance not excess and even then his greatest hope is that it can buy him love. As DiCaprio played him he had the touching austerity of a lone silver cuff link an incomplete man who appears to have everything.Theres nothing as complicated or as appealing in The Wolf of Wall Street and nothing tragic not even tragically funny. Scorsese is one of the few great old-guard filmmakers with the clout to make movies on this scale and this picture -- dreary self-evident too repetitive to be much fun even as satire -- is what he comes up with? Some have already favorably compared this with Brian De Palmas Scarface in that it invites us to revel in its characters amorality from a safe distance and at epic length. But thats a slippery surface-level comparison. Scarface is violent as hell and operatically blunt but oddly enough its not an aggressive picture. It rolls forward in crazy melodramatic waves without pushing its points about the horrors human beings are willing to commit in the name of capitalism. It doesnt have to when theres a chain saw to do the talking. Scorsese on the other hand belabors every angle of this lukewarm morality tale. Its self-conscious and devoid of passion and theres no radiant star at its center. Who would choose DiCaprios depraved squeaky Jordan Belfort over Al Pacinos twisted basso profundo Tony Montana? The Wolf of Wall Street has everything money can buy and still it comes up empty.2 Jonah Hill (left) as perpetually dazed-looking Donnie Azoff.Mary Cybulski - (c) 2013 Paramount Pictures.

Played with pitch-perfect man-boy entitlement by Leonardo DiCaprio this baby-faced swindler-in-the-making steps off the bus onto Wall Street like a wide-eyed ingenue arriving in Old Hollywood. But no sooner has he procured a job at a tony firm than the October 1987 Black Monday crash sends him scuttling back to the suburban poorhouse. Out of middle-class hardship comes master-of-the-universe inspiration While slumming at a strip-mall brokerage Belfort realizes he can sell penny stocks to gullible customers for a huge profit. Thus is born Stratton Oakmont a boiler-room operation of massive fiscal lucre and titanic drug-addled debauchery. Scorsese and screenwriter Terence Winter (who adapted the real-life Belforts 2007 mea culpa bestseller) take everything this flimflammer says at face value. Its all true apparently the dwarf-tossing competitions the sex sprees on transatlantic flights even the reckless sinking of a multimillion-dollar yacht all re-created with no-holds-barred exorbitance. An early sequence in which Belfort lunches with an oily mentor (McConaughey) sets the exhausting jet-black tone building from cynically verbal jabs to chest-beatingly physical displays. The rest of the movie is multiple variations on the same theme--a full immersion into a world of fratboy immorality and unapologetic corruption. So which is it Marty Are you sanctioning this bad behavior or pointedly lampooning it? Much like its cocky protagonist The Wolf of Wall Street is a slippery beast both beguiling and repellent on the surface more difficult to pin down the deeper you look and shifty in ways that I found intoxicating. The movie contains some of the best scenes Scorsese has ever directed notably an extended quaaludes-laced sequence in which a motor-function-deprived Belfort has to figure out how to stop his partner-in-crime (Hill) from choking to death. (Lets just say it involves a lot of Jerry Lewis-like flopping and an energizing hit of cocaine.) Wolf is also an extremely draining experience thats sure to leave plenty of viewers shouting ""We get it"" by the third gluttonous hour. But thats the point Scorsese that sly spiritualist is out to make us sick on commerce and greed run rampant. He moves us beyond the allure of avarice so that we might take better stock of ourselves. What starts as a piggish paean becomes by the end an invigorating purge.

The Wolf of Wall Street has been awarded a nose-thumbing Bronx cheer by some critics as noisy vulgar flashy disgusting and over the top-- the same reasons they adored the talented but self-indulgent Coen brothers Inside Llewyn Davis one of the dreariest most pointless and ludicrously overrated films of the year. O.K. it has all those things not to mention nudity violence graphic sex out-of-control drug use and filthy dialogue. It is also sensational entertainment. This 100 million extravaganza is--lets face it--rampantly over the top. Hell its by Martin Scorsese who is always over the top. But unlike the Coen brothers who have been getting away with murder for years he puts thrilling stuff on the screen that is unforgettable. In good movies or bad his never-ending collaborations with Leonardo DiCaprio (and his last one the pretentious Shutter Island was a real stinker) always fill the screen with something good to look at. This time its all true. Terence Winters action-packed screenplay about the rise and fall of Jordan Belfort is based on the confessional memoir by the reckless multimillionaire stockbroker who served nearly two years in prison for defrauding high-profile investors in a Wall Street corruption scandal that included banking industry big shots and celebrities. (A few boldface names have been changed to avoid litigation.) Clocking in just short of three hours running time it needs a pair of scissors another trip to the editing room and an intermission but if you dont have a bladder problem The Wolf of Wall Street goes by as fast as a nap by the pool in Acapulco. The saga is long and Mr. Scorsese seems hell-bent on filming every minute of it but he never wastes your time doing it. The movie opens with a naked Mr. DiCaprio snorting cocaine from the graphic spaces between a hookers wide-open legs (use your imagination dude) and were off to the races. The sprawling narrative moves around in jumping time frames narrated by Mr. DiCaprio in passages from the Belfort book that take you from his arrogant beginnings as a 22-year-old penny broker from Long Island one of hundreds of Ivy League pin-stripers anxious to conquer the world of finance climbing out of the ashes of Black Monday to sell penny stocks at 6 cents per share in his own self-made investment brokerage firm operating out of an abandoned storefront. His fledgling staff is headed by Donnie Azoff (super-charged Jonah Hill) a pudgy wannabe who is so dumb he thinks jujitsu is a town in Israel. Moving it up a notch Belfort graduates to selling blue chip stocks for 50 percent commissions and a hatchet job in Forbes catapults him to superstardom. By the year he turned 26 he made 49 million funneling most of it up his nose. Orgies on chartered planes with 50 hookers and enough drugs to fly without gasoline. A weekend that cost 2 million plus the renovation of an entire floor of the Mirage Hotel. Marriage to a gorgeous playgirl who becomes his long-suffering wife and the mother of his child (a stunning Margot Robbie who is worth keeping an eye on for more reasons than one) with a 150-foot yacht as a wedding present. You get it all in lush knockout set pieces that look like they were designed for Technicolor. No wonder Leo smelled a film with enough excess to make The Great Gatsby look like Tobacco Road. Consuming enough drugs to sedate all of Manhattan Belfort and his sidekick Donnie pull out the stops most notably in a very long sequence in which they overdose on Quaaludes and vodka in the middle of a botched attempt to smuggle 2 million out of a Swiss bank moving from the living room to a country club and back again plummeting down a flight of stairs projectile vomiting smashing up cars and wrecking the furniture. All you can do is observe all of this wicked cinematic exorbitance with your mouth wide open follow all of the illegal tricks they pull to climb the ladder to success and wait for the crash. In the meantime you can thrill to Leos loosest most passionate performance to date and applaud Mr. Hill who matches his madness every step of the way. The movie fails to make any of its characters appealing and I didnt much care what happened to them but when the downfall comes at last propelled by handsome Kyle Chandler as FBI investigator Patrick Denham I was almost sorry to see their escapades coming to an end. Others were racing for the exit doors. From bit parts by Matthew McConaughey Jean Dujardin (The Artist) Christine Ebersole Rob Reiner and Fran Lebowitz to Ahmad Jamal jazz and Brioni suits the movie wears its labels well. The sets are ravishing. The cinematography dazzles. Theres so much going on that you dont blink for fear that you might miss something. Did I say over the top? I meant over the moon. Against my better judgment there were times in The Wolf of Wall Street when I was over the moon myself.

The subject matter. The epic running time. All the signs pointed to real-life stock-market story The Wolf of Wall Street being classic old-school Martin Scorsese drugs swearing big speeches bigger performances a spot of social critique and lashings of classic rock. But while many of these elements are present something unexpected has snuck in alongside them huge unashamedly crowd-pleasing laughs. This is without doubt the funniest movie of Scorseses career - earlier efforts like The King of Comedy and After Hours may have been brilliant but their chuckles were chillier and more unsettling. The Wolf of Wall Street plays modern tragedy as epic farce reminding us just how much fun Scorsese can be when hes in a playful mood. It also proves - equally unexpectedly - that Leonardo DiCaprio can do comedy too. He plays Jordan Belfort an unscrupulous stock-market wizard who in his early twenties became a multi-multi-millionaire by fleecing Americans out of their hard-earned investments. Belfort - along with his goofy-toothed sidekick Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill) - lived high on the hog for the best part of a decade a constant roundelay of booze yachts hookers and hard drugs. That is until the authorities came a-knocking... Predictably The Wolf of Wall Street is more flash than substance. Scorsese never digs too deeply under the skin of these reprehensible playboy douchebags and there are times where the swooping photography smash-and-grab editing and toe-tapping soundtrack conspire to almost - almost - make us like them. But when the films cylinders are firing its impossible not to be dragged along. The big set-pieces - a coke-fuelled lecture from an unscrupulous Matthew McConaughey a squirm-inducing encounter between DiCaprio and Joanna Lumley on a London park bench a Mediterranean cruise that goes horribly wrong and most memorably a grandiose slapstick sequence involving a sports car and a fistful of vintage quaaludes - are among the most memorable of Scorseses career rivalling Goodfellas for sheer vitality. The result may not be the most measured take on the ongoing financial crisis but it is without doubt the most entertaining.

Before this films release I felt that I knew what to expect from Martin Scorsese and I was very curious to see what his take would be. But he executes it brilliantly and captures the true essence of the Wild West. And whilst Di Caprio is an absolute star as the over-indulgent sex-crazed degenerate drug addicted Jordan Belfort I would keep an eye out for Jonah Hill at this years Oscars as he is a revelation.

It is long for a film these days but there is no let up in the action.It is subversive. There is objectification of women - it is in the book and is central to the story.

He lives a selfish drugged-fuelled money grabbing cheating existence and thinks only of himself. Yet annoyingly you end up routing for him. That in itself I believe is clever story telling.From the opening shot to the very end the film takes you on a journey with camera work that draws you right in. This is what makes the film so compelling and like the drug habits of Belfort himself its rather addictive. Perhaps the life he leads the hedonism and the highs is rather an enjoyable experience and for a whole 3 hours you get to travel along on this fantasy.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 11 2015stephen jFeaturedFinally got around to watching this film so Im very late to the party (and boy what a party).So as youd expect with Scorsese this is a well executed fantastic looking film with some great scenes and its a nice change to see some brash (and pretty dark) comedy substituting the usual violence youd associate with his best films. Overall great entertainment value and worth seeing on that basis but on the downside its lacking any real depth - it doesnt attempt to explain what motivates the greed these people exhibit or the basis of their relationships (Di Caprio and Jonas Di Caprio and his father). Also while Di Caprio does a good turn for me  he doesnt earn any outstanding accolades. Its an over the top fairly shallow character theres no subtlety to the role which is down to the script rather than him but I cant help but think that most half descent actors would be able to turn in a convincing performance.All in all though for a thoroughly enjoyable piece of entertaining escapism its well worth a watch and its a must see for any Scorsese and /or Di Caprio fans (which should be everyone right ?)Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 11 2014adaromasFeaturedVery long took me 2 nights to finish.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJul 15 2014Tammy N Bruce SFeaturedIt was an ok movieHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreMar 25 2014Marcelo VFeaturedDi Caprio is great actor.

At this point ""white Wall Street conmen experience meteoric rise and disgraceful plummet as accompanied by prostitutes and drugs; cause us to question our own social values"" isnt new ground to tread. In a year where we had some pretty cool and unusual things happening in mainstream cinema (an animated ""princess"" movie where the most important relationship was between two sisters a space thriller whose face was a middle-aged woman a high-grossing action movie starring a young woman a sci-fi blockbuster where 2/3 leads were NOT white men a female buddy-cop movie) this just seems....tired.

Like a few said it does rather fizzle out towards the end and the last half an hour does seem rather abrupt. It is as if a 3 1/2 hour film had to be cut below 3 hours after original screenings. Di Caprio is excellent as is Hill though much as you root for them at times it is difficult to forget the yacht house drugs hookers and beautiful wives came on the backs of people ripped off.

Photo AP MOVIE REVIEW Wolf of Wall Street Emperor Has No Clothes. Ditto cast. Running time 179 minutes. Rated R (massive drug use full frontal female nudity profanity violence). Opens Dec. 25 at the Ziegfeld the Empire the Union Square others. Naked Hookers Cocaine Quaaludes Hookers and cocaine Quaaludes and hookers Dwarf tossing Naked Leonardo DiCaprio with a candle in his butt Leo snorting coke from a hookers butt Rinse repeat . . . If youre going to invest three hours watching a movie about a convicted stock swindler it needs to be a whole lot more compelling than Martin Scorseses handsome sporadically amusing and admittedly never boring -- but also bloated redundant vulgar shapeless and pointless -- ""Wolf of Wall Street. Leonardo DiCaprio goes way way way over the top in this strenuously comic and far-too-faithful adaptation of the self-serving and credulity-straining memoir by Jordan Belfort who spent just two years at a country-club prison for defrauding unwitting investors of millions (thanks to turning in his colleagues). Scorseses classic ""Goodfellas explored crime and its consequences in fascinating detail but this is a very different kind of movie. Its basically an advertorial showing that crime pays though its surprisingly uninterested in the particulars much less Belforts victims (both those on his payroll and those coerced into investing their life savings in worthless stocks). This is pretty well summed up in one of Leo-as-Belforts lengthy addresses directly to the camera where he interrupts a none-too-clear explanation of a money-laundering scheme to tell the audience ""But you dont care about any of this All you care about is whether we made a sh-load of money Dicaprio now pushing 40 needs to reconsider playing 20-something-year-old characters.Photo Trailer Belforts crimes -- and his lengthy pursuit in the early 1990s by a party-pooping FBI agent (Kyle Chandler) who finally takes him down -- take a back seat to the depiction of what he did with that money. Much of it went up his nose and into various orifices of hookers. Scorsese and his screenwriter seem to think that the only way to depict these excesses is to be excessive themselves -- why show one or two out-of-control bacchanals when you can stage a handful? The films of what you might call Scorseses Leo period (from ""The Aviator on and including the DiCaprio-free ""Hugo) have increasingly showcased scenes that go on forever mostly so that the maestro can indulge in elaborate camera moves that impress some critics but in no way advance the story. Theres not much narrative drive in Terence Winters highly episodic script and what little there is grinds to a halt for numerous sequences that really ought to have ended up on the cutting room floor. Like Belforts lengthy and pointless interrogation of a crooked butler or a stormy effect-laden trip on our heros huge yacht that could have been avoided if only he used the helicopter on the ships deck. And what exactly is Jon Favreau doing here except for collecting a paycheck? A bigger problem for me was that except for Belforts quickly disposed-of first wife (Cristin Milioti very good) and Rob Reiners underwritten part as Belforts father -- the films very nominal conscience -- there were no characters in this in many ways loathsome and amoral movie that I cared about. Belforts second wife (the bodacious Margot Robbie) is depicted as a greedy and manipulative sexpot and enabler with all of the other female characters coming off far worse in this shamelessly misogynist epic. The men are mostly crude ethnic caricatures -- most prominently a very flamboyant whore-chasing and coke-snorting Jonah Hill as Donny Azoff a fictionalized version of Belforts real-life second-in-command Danny Porush (who has questioned the veracity of some of Belforts wilder stories including those with a dwarf and a horse). And then theres DiCaprio pushing 40 who really needs to stop playing characters in their 20s. You have to give him credit though for stretching here -- and not just with that candle in his butt. DiCaprioPhoto YouTube Theres a very lengthy scene where DiCaprio demonstrates the tranquilizing effects of an unusually potent dose of quaaludes on his ambulatory skills. Lets just say hes no Jim Carrey though Scorsese seems to think he is. Nor is DiCaprios Belfort as charming as the film requires -- a quality the actor managed far better in ""The Great Gatsby (Matthew McConaughey shows how its done in a brief cameo here). This is the most drug-obsessed Hollywood movie Ive seen since Brian De Palmas notorious ""Scarface 30 years ago. It reminded me of a quote attributed to Scorsese at the films New York premiere ""You guys are great -- but be prepared because theyre going to hate it in Hollywood . . . because its about them. I wonder if the director who at 71 really lets it all hang out here was attracted to the excesses of ""Wolf of Wall Street for personal reasons. Scorsese has publicly admitted he had a serious substance-abuse problem in the 1970s -- and his drugs of choice matched Belforts heroin and quaaludes. Belfort recently boasted to The Posts Andrea Peyser that he could make as much as 30 million from the movie. He promised it would all go to his victims who the feds say have seen a small portion of the 10 million in restitution he promised to pay before beginning a lucrative career as a motivational speaker. You might want to consider that before you fork over your 15 for a film that in the final analysis is more exhausting than exhilarating.

TWITTER At nearly three hours of pushing the R rating Martin Scorseses film leaves no storytelling trick unused while watching Jordan Belfort embrace Wall Streets cutthroat ethos. At the very least Leonardo DiCaprio can claim to have cornered the market on 20th century Long Island gazillionaires. Having begun his year portraying Jazz Age mystery man Jay Gatsby he closes it by serving up a wild portrait of a poster child for 90s financial excess in The Wolf of Wall Street. Nearly as extravagant as the characters it depicts Martin Scorseses comic operatically-scaled film is on a moment-by-moment basis often madly entertaining due to its live-wire energy exuberant performances and the irresistible appeal of watching naughty boys doing very naughty things. PHOTOS Martin Scorsese Leonardo DiCaprio Spill Candid Stories on the Making of The Wolf of Wall Street At the same time the dramatic strategy of titilating an audience with salacious behavior for 90 percent of the time only to deliver a wages-of-sin message at the end is older than Cecil B. DeMille while the hopped-up visuals editing and music feel like the stylistic equivalent of doubling up coke and Viagra. Without a doubt Paramounts sybaritic three-hour Christmas Day release will divide audiences but the now five-film DiCaprio-Scorsese collaboration should continue to yield pretty strong returns commercially. Although never the household name hell now become with a big movie made about him Jordan Belfort was nonetheless emblematic of the unrestrained financial shenanigans of the final years of the American century when the idea of any consequences for lid-off monetary opportunism seemed unthinkable (its quite likely that Wolf could be a giant hit in China Russia and other markets where the spectacle of American irresponsibility will be most appreciated). A working-class New York kid Belfort enthusiastically embraced the cutthroat Wall Street ethos in his early 20s and eventually formed a respectable-sounding company Stratton Oakmont featuring a boiler room ethos among employees that was thoroughly drilled in their leaders take-no-prisoners sales approach. Indicted in 1998 for securities fraud and money laundering Belfort got off easy by ratting out many associates to the FBI and served but a brief sentence in a country club-like prison facility where his bunkmate was Tommy Chong. Hes now a popular motivational speaker his fee no doubt about to soar. The format of Terence Winters ever-percolating script closely resembles those of two major Scorsese films about underworld figures Goodfellas and especially Casino. Wolf is wallpapered with first-person narration takes pains to explain how the business and scams work and positively wallows in the pleasure of elaborating the minutiae of self-gratification through criminal and otherwise depraved activity the immorality and illegality of which have been totally waived away by the characters. This approach works on the viewer by providing what feels like privileged access to individuals youd abhor in real life but who as inhabited onscreen by charismatic actors are undeniably fascinating for how they get away with so much for so long. Its the gangster formula here applied to white collar types. VIDEO Martin Scorsese Leonardo DiCaprio Finally Open Up About Wolf of Wall Street Scorseses point of view toward these characters and his reasons for returning to them time and again could profitably be analyzed further. Its safe to say however that at 71 the director is still making the films of a much younger man and is showing no signs of turning toward a more reflective meditative style. Effectively setting both the iniquitous attitude and the adrenalized acting style that will predominate is Matthew McConaughey who in his one big scene as a successful drug-drink-and-sex-addled broker tutors the 22-year-old greenhorn Jordan (DiCaprio) at a very funny lunch on what it takes to become a whiz in the money business. Jordan has just gotten a taste of Wall Street life when Black Monday hits in October 1987 sending him back to square one. Married and desperate for any income he sets up a few desks in a Long Island garage slaps the ""classy"" name of Stratton Oakmont on it and instructs a few young guys most notably eager acolyte Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill) in the high-pressure art of selling penny stocks to suckers over the phone. Its the start of something very very big. From the outset the parties and celebrations are totally debauched; throughout Scorsese pushes to the outer limits of the R rating (the film did require cutting to avoid an NC-17) in showing drug excess perhaps outdone only by Scarface and rampant sex including in the workplace. Even when the firm grows to a thousand employees the office filled with white-shirt-and-black-tied men more often resembles a mosh pit more than a place of business. Jordans ferocious inspirational speeches to his troops are among the films highlights and the boss gets his greatest satisfaction from seeing the men (there are a few women) go ape with abandon at the prospect of their unethical practices reaping ever-escalating profits. Greed is all-pervasive and is held as lifes greatest virtue. With success for Jordan comes a trade-up trophy wife; Naomi Lapaglia (promising Australian newcomer Margot Robbie) is as gorgeous as can be although her lower-class roots show whenever she opens her mouth. The charter flight to Vegas for a 2 million wedding party sets a new high bar for R-rated debauchery (this was reportedly one of the scenes most heavily trimmed for the ratings board) and the skys the limit on other expenditures as well mansions the fanciest cars a helicopter and a yacht to which Jordan invites FBI agent Denham (an excellent low-key Kyle Chandler) when authorities decide to put him in their sights. One particularly tasty side story involves Jordans use of Naomis stylish British aunt Emma (Joanna Lumley) to systematically stash large sums of cash in Swiss banks. A proud survivor of the Swinging Sixties Emma is a wonderful character in this context one whose eyebrows are scarcely raised by the younger generations antics because shes seen it all--and no doubt participated in it--before. An innuendo-laden scene between her and Jordan in a park is a classic of alternating voice-over inner dialogue. STORY How Armani Dressed The Wolf of Wall Street Scorsese leaves no storytelling device or trick unused except for understatement. The real-life story being told may be dramatic but much of it is played for comedy sometimes to the edge of farce notably in a hilarious scene in which Jordan under the effect of vintage Quaaludes to ""the cerebral palsy stage"" agonizingly drags himself out of a country club tumbles down a flight of stairs and attempts to drive home. Its hallucinatory slapstick under the influence of Jerry Lewis and Jacques Tati and one of the directors most inspired film buff interpolations here is to intercut Jordans drug ingestion with a clip of Popeye downing a can of spinach. Even after hes indicted in 1998 and is forced to give farewell speech to his disbelieving staff Jordan has at least one more surprise up his sleeve which extends the film right up to the three-hour mark. There are a few scenes and minor character subplots that could have been lost particularly a protracted dispute between Donnie and a tough-guy underling that looks like it was meant to be funnier than it is and diverts attention from the central character for too long. But Scorsese clearly intended this to be a comedy-lined epic maxed out to grand opera proportions so a little excess more or less wasnt going to make much difference. Jordan would scarcely disagree. This is undoubtedly DiCaprios largest and best screen performance one in which he lets loose as he never has before is not protective of vanity or a sense of cool and one feels gets completely to the bottom of his character. Caution was not an option with this characterization; the word does not exist for the actor or the character. Unlike most of his screen work to date Hill is not (just) comic relief here but a credible if weird figure an eager young man perennially keen to prove to his boss that hes willing not only to embrace but exceed his high standards of waywardness. The actors timing is terrific and he keeps offering surprises and nuances to the end. Even though its hard to believe he could have fathered DiCaprio Rob Reiner is a hoot as Jordans old-line accountant dad. Even in this context Jean Dujardin is a bit over-the-top as the smarmy Swiss banker. Production values are expectedly top of the line across the board. However coming from a filmmaker as meticulous as Scorsese its surprising to see so many small but noticeable mismatched cuts in some of the dialogue scenes here. Jordan Belforts story inspired the indie film Boiler Room in 2000.

More often than not theyll either become less captivating or descend into self-parody (see De Niro Robert in anything not directed by David O. Russell). A Movie Star becoming more interesting and more textured as a performer seems almost unheard of. That Leonardo DiCaprio""gt;Leonardo DiCaprio can still surprise us as he does with his extraordinary turn in Martin Scorseses ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is exciting enough but his performance goes even further redefining his thespian abilities and branching out his screen presence into new and fascinating territories. Starring as shifty stockbroker Jordan Belfort DiCaprio delivers some of his most electrifying moments on the big screen -- when he gives his fellow traders a pep talk its like watching a revival meeting in a Brooks Brothers. The actor isnt just channeling Gordon Gekko here; he reaches full-on Elmer Gantry heights of ecstasy. Belforts story is a rise and fall not unlike the one featured in another Scorsese saga ""GoodFellas"" but while it was only in that earlier films last act that the hero (and the movie itself) started pinging around on a cocaine high the white powder appears visually (and narratively) at the beginning of ""Wolf"" guiding both the characters and the storytelling pace into whiz-bang teeth-grinding euphoria. Also read Wolf of Wall Street Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio Bring Sex Drugs and Money to the Oscar Race We first see Belfort as a young up-and-comer working in an established brokerage firm and being taken under the wing of Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey in a one-scene wonder of a performance) who counsels his protege in the ways of drug abuse and self-abuse (masturbation twice daily is advised) as a way to get to the top. Hanna also tells Belfort that investment itself is a drug; the clients might make money on paper but they never lay their hands on it since they can always be convinced to chase the dragon through more and more reinvestments all of which mean more money for the brokers. Belfort soon becomes a licensed broker himself but his first day on the job winds up being October 19 1987 -- better known as the infamous ""Black Monday."" Out of a job Belfort hooks up with a penny-ante bunch of penny-stock salesmen and he uses his Wall Street know-how to sell this junk paper in staggeringly high volume. Soon hes taking the tiny company to the big time teaching his tricks of the trade to the formerly slovenly sales force and to his neighbor Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill) who eagerly hitches his wagon to Belforts rising star. See video Leonardo DiCaprio Parties Hard in Martin Scorseses Wolf of Wall Street Trailer Swanky houses trophy wives helicopters and yachts follow with Belfort cockily playing cat-and-mouse with a federal investigator (played by Kyle Chandler) while an array of prescription and illicit drugs courses through his body. In many ways ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" outdoes ""The Great Gatsby"" in its portrayal of Long Island indulgence and hollow materialism; unlike Baz Luhrmann Scorsese doesnt allow himself to become blinded by the flash and dazzle. One of the highlights of ""Wolf"" comes in an extended sequence in which Belfort must leave his estate to find an outside phone line and then make his way back home all while a handful of old-school Quaaludes suddenly takes effect. Its one of the funniest and most physical moments DiCaprio has ever been allowed on film and the scene is simultaneously hilarious suspenseful and pathetic. I dont think Ive seen an actor go through such elaborate physical contortions in portraying a man with limited control over his motor functions since Steve Martin in ""All of Me."" Also turning in an extraordinary performance is Hill seemingly borrowing Stanley Tuccis veneers from the ""Hunger Games"" movies as DiCaprios faithful sidekick. Never as glib or as handsome as Belfort Donny maintains a sense of flawed humanity as the movie spirals further and further into glossy excess. (The cast is loaded with scene-stealers from Rob Reiner to Joanna Lumley to Jean Dujardin.) See video Leo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill Go Into Dirty Business Together in Wolf of Wall Street Trailer ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is a terrific and fascinating movie but it stops short of masterpiece territory -- as a character in Stephen Sondheims ""Merrily We Roll Along"" observes ""You want to know what true greatness is? Its knowing when to get off [stage]."" Ive got no objection to a three-hour movie in theory but Scorsese and his legendary editor Thelma Schoonmaker allow the film to repeat itself from time to time overdoing a tale that is itself already about the act of overdoing it. Also read Boardwalk Empire Could Terence Winter Lure Leonardo DiCaprio to the Boardwalk? Its also a letdown that the screenplay by ""Sopranos"" and ""Boardwalk Empire"" vet Terence Winter (based on Belforts memoir) has so little interest in the women here; Belforts sexy second wife Naomi (Margot Robbie TVs ""Pan Am"") is literally objectified -- which is probably intentional -- but just one or two scenes with Belforts betrayed first wife (Cristin Milioti ""How I Met Your Mother"") might have offered up some interesting perspective on our protagonist. Winter also gives Belfort narration in which he tries to explain his financial chicanery to the audience before throwing his hands up and changing the subject; its a cute shtick but there are a few moments when a little exposition about say Belforts transition from slinger of penny stocks to titan of the market would have come in handy. (And without getting too much into spoilers suffice it to say that Belforts fall doesnt seem commensurate with his rise. But hey its a true story.) Scorsese it bears noting still has one of the deepest bags of tricks of any filmmaker working today and ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" sees him still reveling in them. This may fall a few points under his blue chip offerings but I never felt shorted. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

With an untamed energy that dwarfs any of his crime dramas Scorseses raucous exhausting display is driven by an eager commitment to vulgarity. As stock market scammer Jordan Belfort Leonardo DiCaprios unfettered ferocity meshes with Scorseses aim of exploring Belforts crafty early nineties rise. Turning his memoir into a vivid portrait of the hedonistic excesses associated with unregulated wealth ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" amps up an absurd volume of entertainment value. But it also suffers from an overabundance of the qualities that elevate it to such ridiculous heights. Scorsese depicts his maniacal subjects far better than he interrogates their mania. Terence Winters screenplay provides a loose structure for Scorseses wildly improvised tale which opens in the midst of a stockbroker office party before sketching out Belforts origin story. It takes little time to establish that Belfort will be our guide to the mayhem which in its opening minutes finds the character careening down the highway in a sports car while receiving fellatio from his trophy wife before crashing a helicopter into the front lawn of his mansion. As Belfort narrates this brash introduction to his reckless lifestyle Scorsese unleashes a slew of stylistic bells and whistles freeze frames slo-mo a blaring rock soundtrack and snazzy camerawork set the stage for a tale of debauchery that refuses to let up. Certainly a funhouse for Scorseses longtime editor Thelma Schoonmaker ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" feels both totally slick and assaultive an apt tone for Belforts self-destructive world. For sheer liveliness it ranks as the most robust teaming for DiCaprio and Scorsese and provides ample terrain for Jonah Hill to diversify his range in a supporting role as Belforts wildcard business partner. While not as refined as ""The Departed"" it has a lot more gall. DiCaprio and Scorsese compensate for the lethargic stretches of ""Shutter Island"" and ""The Aviator"" by bringing a demented vigor to each moment. The resulting bravado gels nicely with the material while echoing the gritty qualities of Scorseses earlier works. Harkening back to the jittery sleazeballs of ""Mean Streets"" Belfort and company decontextualize the usual Scorsese brand of crime by turning it into a cartoonish office farce. Until the FBI catches up these swindlers are more liberated in their savage pursuits than any other clandestine lawbreakers in the Scorsese oeuvre. Yet while ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is sometimes hard to take and unapologetically erratic Scorsese and Winter capably establish how things got that way. The details of their story draws on more real incidents than meets the eye -- including bullying office tactics that included the devouring of a negligent employees goldfish as well party guests that included costumed little people and at least one monkey. Kinky prostitutes and cocaine fly freely. The orgiastic display makes Oliver Stones ""Wall Street"" look downright minimalist. Many of these incidents stem from Belfords actual account of his antics which kicked into high gear in his twenties after he launched the Long Island-based ""boiler room"" firm Stratton Oakmont. Concocting a scheme to drive up the price of shares with specious hype and then cashing in on them Belfort and his cohort Danny Porush -- played by Hill under the fictionalized name Donny Azoff -- pulled in upwards of 200 millions for their ""pump and dump"" scheme before landing jail time in the middle of the decade. Flashing back to the initially overwhelmed young Belfort during his first Wall Street gig the movie quickly lays out his rapid transition into a capitalist psychopath. ""Money doesnt just buy you a better life"" he asserts. ""It makes you a better person."" The irony of that statement is it arrives as we witness its opposite effect. In fact ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" lays out the equation of corruption almost too neatly with Belfort getting schooled in the ways of his new profession from a chest-thumping Matthew McConaughey as one of his earlier office mentors. In a fleeting but crucial cameo McConaughey lays out the rules of succeeding in the profession -- a zany laundry list that includes various narcotics and sexual dealings -- which is more than enough to set Belfort off and running. After the devastating Black Monday crash of 1987 Belfort manages to funnel his lessons from the bottom of the totem pole to climb straight to the top. Before long hes surrounded by a new wife fresh digs and hundreds of thousands of dollars in escort charges. Largely restricted to Belforts point of view (even most memorably when hes under the influence) ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" lurches forward as its plot details remain fairly minimal. Only when the FBI grows curious about his scheme does Belfort turn to a similarly cunning Swiss bank accountant (Jean Dujardin his eyebrow cocked and half-grin frozen) in an attempt to save his riches. While not a fully defined presence Dujardin gets a chance to match wits with DiCaprio in another amusingly over-the-top scene in which the two men communicate telepathically about their scummy motives. And thats just one of several moments where ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" sets story aside for the sake of letting the actors play. The women are naturally short-shrifted although Margot Robbie lands some snappy moments as Belforts sultry wife. Virtually everyone onscreen in ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" gets a chance to mess around (even Spike Jonze crops up for a fun cameo) but the casts true secret weapon in Jonah Hill. As the wacky flamboyant Donny Hills most accomplished performance to date exists on an entirely different plane from anything hes done before. His hyperactive presence is the ideal comic side dish to DiCaprios embodiment of a more subdued sociopath. While DiCaprio never really vanishes into the role its still impressive to watch him swing for the fences. Outdoing his turn as Jay Gatsby he uses his movie-star persona in service of making the characters superficial addictions come to life. Its a starry performance of a guy who believes so thoroughly in his power that he forces it into reality at every moment. When we watch Belfort pantomime sex while courting a client on speaker phone its easy to get wrapped up in the slapstick amusement of his commitment to the performance. Scorsese complements DiCaprio with an equally zany flair including one knockout sequence that finds the character wreaking havoc while on Qualuudes. These moments dont give the movie much of a soul but the unruliness provides set pieces that compensate for what amounts to a long slog through terrible behavior. Always something of a horror show about the perils of too much money at its best ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" explores its corporate targets by transforming their world into a working professional twist on ""Animal House."" But as Scorsese keeps the salaciousness coming -- an airplane orgy here an Samp;M session there -- ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" diminishes the ability for ideas to win out over the spectacle. Theres no question about the efficacy of Scorseses filmmaking prowess only that he never knows -- or doesnt care -- to slow down and deepen the material. Despite the sexual pageants that beckon comparisons to ""Fellini Satyricon"" Scorseses best-directed scenes aim for grander visions An impressively realized boat sequence in which Belfort gets caught in a storm and refuses to face death sober stands out for its metaphorical representation of financial uncertainties. Scorseses ability to work a major set piece into his story temporarily makes its heft seem worthwhile. But its only a single weighty moment in a sea of many more superfluous ones. Thematically speaking ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is often too obvious and never remotely subtle. Still the inherently trivial means by which Scorsese foregrounds his protagonists insanity pays off in a climax that hints at Belforts ability to infect society at large with the same lusts that corrupted him in the first place. While hes told earlier by a cohort that the FBI ""thinks youre Gordon fucking Gekko"" the movie asserts that hes something scarier Belforts lasting successes imply not that greed is good but that it has the power to make its champions invincible. Scorsese makes that point too bluntly and too often while sometimes celebrating the same excess hes seemingly trying to condemn. That very ambiguity infuses ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" with the same overwhelming and dangerous sense of self-determination that afflicts its characters. Criticwire grade B HOW WILL IT PLAY? With buzz high and the vulgar ingredients generating obvious box office heat Paramount is bound to see strong returns when ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" opens Christmas Day. While competition at this time of the year is formidable the movie seems well-positioned to continue gaining momentum in the new year and remaining a player throughout the rest of Oscar season when its bound to land major nominations (if less likely to score big wins).

In a year where we had some pretty cool and unusual things happening in mainstream cinema (an animated aprincessa movie where the most important relationship was between two sisters a space thriller whose face was a middle-aged woman a high-grossing action movie starring a young woman a sci-fi blockbuster where 2/3 leads were NOT white men a female buddy-cop movie) this just seemsa|.tired.

Even Gordon Gekko looks like a veritable lap dog compared to Jordan Belfort the self-proclaimed ""Wolf of Wall Street"" whose coked-up pill-popping high-rolling shenanigans made him a multi-millionaire at age 26 a convicted felon a decade later and a bestselling author and motivational speaker a decade after that. Now Belforts riches-to-slightly-less-riches tale has been brought to the screen by no less a connoisseur of charismatic sociopaths than Martin Scorsese and the result is a big unruly bacchanal of a movie that huffs and puffs and nearly blows its own house down but holds together by sheer virtue of its furious filmmaking energy and a Leonardo DiCaprio star turn so electric it could wake the dead. Arriving six weeks past its original November release date and still showing signs of editing-room haste ""Wolf"" should ride a high want-to-see factor and generally admiring reviews to solid holiday B.O. though its length and extreme content may keep the reportedly 100 million production from reaching the rarefied aerie of ""The Departed"" (289 million worldwide) and ""Shutter Island"" (294 million worldwide). After going unexpectedly kid-friendly for 2011s ""Hugo"" (his first PG movie in two decades) Scorsese could hardly have followed with a more dramatic about-face than ""Wolf"" which skirts the very outer limits of the R rating with its nonstop barrage of drug-fueled decadence all put across with a sinister smile. In the first reel alone which aptly sets the tone for whats to come Belfort (DiCaprio) can be seen snorting coke off a prostitutes backside getting fellated while driving his white Ferrari and nearly crashing his private helicopter while high on a homemade cocktail of Quaaludes Xanax and morphine (the last one ""because its awesome""). If some of the advance hype suggested that ""Wolf"" was going to be a kind of ""Goodfellas"" on Wall Street in reality its more like the jittery paranoid third act of that movie stretched out to three hours starting at a fever pitch and heading toward the nuclear. In the prologue to ""Wolf"" the first of two volumes of memoirs Belfort wrote that he hoped his story would serve as ""a cautionary tale to the rich and poor alike"" though there was little in the 500 pages that followed (or in the cover line ""I partied like a rock star lived like a king"") that suggested contrition. Nor have Scorsese and screenwriter Terence Winter brought any retroactive moralizing to bear on the material. Rather they take Belfort on his own questionable terms seeking to reproduce the atmosphere of crazed alpha-male intensity that engulfed the trading floor at Stratton Oakmont the Belfort-founded brokerage house which in ""Wolf"" comes to resemble a Boschian Rome before the fall. It is the sort of office where a bathroom placard kindly reminds everyone not to engage in intercourse on the premises during office hours -- right where the ""Employees Must Wash Hands"" sign usually goes. The movie begins in medias res with Belfort and his devoted minions blowing off steam in an office dwarf-tossing competition before flashing back to give us a brief glimpse of the young and relatively innocent Jordan who arrives on Wall Street in the fall of 1987 as a ""connector"" -- basically a glorified phone dialer -- for the old-money trading firm of L.F. Rothschild. Its there that the eager rookie gets his first sense of the wild life to come when a mad-hatter senior broker (Matthew McConaughey) takes him out for a three-martini lunch that also includes enough white powder for a killer day at Big Bear. And even though hes no longer quite boyish enough to play someone in his early 20s DiCaprio is convincingly green here like a wide-eyed Candide lunching with McConaugheys debauched Dr. Pangloss. But no sooner has Jordan settled in than Black Monday arrives and the bottom falls out of the market and L.F. Rothschild sending him back to the help-wanted ads at a time when nobody seems to be looking for stockbrokers. Nobody that is save for a storefront brokerage in a Long Island strip mall where the slovenly staff unloads worthless penny stocks on cold-called clients for 50% commissions and where Belfort sticks out like a Savile Row suit on a Kmart clearance rack. But the genial proprietor (an uncredited Spike Jonze) agrees to give him a shot not quite realizing hes just let a wolf in the door. It isnt long before Belfort branches out on his own starting the tony-sounding Stratton Oakmont in a declasse former gas station resolving to go from ""selling garbage to garbagemen"" to targeting the deep-pocketed one percent. He assembles a merry band of brokers comprised of petty thugs drug dealers and high-school dropouts who when trained in Belforts precision-scripted tactics prove to be remarkably effective salesmen. Riding herd on them all is Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill) a buffoonish caricature of a Jew in WASP Land decked out in garish bleached teeth clear-lens horn-rims and a sweater tied ever so carefully around his neck. (Belforts own Jewishness and WASP aspirations a running theme in the book have been omitted from the film.) After offering his services to Belfort out of the blue in a local diner Donnie becomes the Wolfs most trusted associate and its Hill who gives the movies most flamboyant (if slightly one-note) comic performance unzipping his schlong swallowing a live goldfish and otherwise boldly exploring the gray area between mankind and our nearest relatives on the evolutionary scale. Clocking in at 179 minutes ""Wolf"" sets a record as Scorseses longest fiction film (one minute longer than ""Casino"") but that doesnt make it his most ambitious or deeply felt. It lacks the dynamic emotional range of a ""Mean Streets"" or ""Goodfellas"" or the intricate plotting of a ""Casino"" and for all its amusing guest stars (Rob Reiner as Belforts combustible dad Jean Dujardin as a pompous Swiss banker) and caper-like episodes almost everything unfolds in the same manic register. Even when the movie is really cooking (which is often) theres a feeling that scenes are being held for a few beats too many that Scorsese and his ace editor Thelma Schoonmaker simply didnt have enough time to do the elegant fine-tuning theyre accustomed to (an impression reinforced by several conspicuous continuity gaffes and badly matched cuts throughout the film). Still considering how familiar this milieu of fast-talking hard-selling hucksters is from the likes of ""Wall Street"" ""American Psycho"" ""Boiler Room"" (which was also inspired by the Belfort case) and ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" its surprising how lively Scorsese manages to keep things throughout. In terms of style the movie is almost self-consciously Scorsesean -- even more than ""The Departed"" -- with d.p. Rodrigo Prietos camera tracking elaborately freeze-framing dollying in fast and whip-panning even faster while a quadruple albums worth of classic rock and blues fill up the soundtrack (veteran Scorsese collaborator Robbie Robertson more than earns his ""executive music producer"" credit) alongside DiCaprios running first-person narration. This is very much iconic old-school Scorsese in full bloom but whats missing is the marvelous empathy the filmmaker managed to conjure for even those films most reprehensible characters -- the sense that this former seminarian could see the good and ill in the souls of troubled men even finding some kind of tormented nobility in the psychopath Travis Bickle. In ""Wolf"" that empathy has been replaced by an overarching cynicism -- cynicism for the swindlers who do the swindling and the schmucks who get snookered cynicism for the empty allure of the good life and cynicism for a system that allows for so many clean getaways. (Belforts nominal downfall notwithstanding those wishing to see the character get his real comeuppance will still be waiting after the end credits have rolled and the lights have come back up.) Make no mistake ""Wolf"" is as much a gangster movie as any Scorsese has made with Belfort as a Bill the Butcher who slices and dices peoples bank accounts a Nicky Santoro who puts your savings in a vise. But on some basic level hes a cipher whose drug-fueled binges regularly put others (including in one harrowing scene his own young daughter) in harms way and who thinks nothing of recruiting his wifes British aunt (an excellent Joanna Lumley) as a front -- or in the movies distinctive patois ""rathole"" -- for his offshore accounts. As dramatis personae go Belfort lacks a tragic dimension This latter-day Gatsby stares out from his own extravagant Long Island enclave and sees only a blinking green dollar sign. But a talented performer can do much to camouflage such shortcomings and thats precisely what DiCaprio does here. A reliably good actor who too often shows you all the hard technical work hes put into creating a character the DiCaprio of ""Wolf"" seems loose and uninhibited and freed of premeditated mannerisms. In his fifth collaboration with Scorsese hes a constant joy to watch whether crawling across the floor like a baby while his bombshell second wife (appealing Australian newcomer Margot Robbie who deserves more screen time) engages in a particularly cruel form of cock-blocking or rallying his disciples with an impassioned variation on Gekkos ""Greed Is Good"" speech. DiCaprio doesnt just play this part; he inhales it along with everything else that goes up Belforts nose and into his bloodstream. For anything resembling gravitas though one must instead look to the dogged FBI agent Patrick Denham (Kyle Chandler) who sets Belfort in his sights early on and gradually closes in. In one of the movies best scenes a cocksure Jordan goes so far as to invite the G-man on to his yacht and comes within a hairsbreadth of bribing him. And Chandler who projects the effortless middle-class virtue of a 1950s leading man (a Robert Stack type) plays the scene with a wonderfully sly poker face leading Belfort the egomaniac to believe hes actually buying what hes selling. But the sting of ""Wolf"" comes in Denhams realization that while he may have gotten his man its Belfort who may well have the last laugh. Moments like those keep ""Wolf"" buoyant and lithe in spite of its redundancies and excesses. But if theres one scene here that is sure to end up in future Scorsese career-achievement montages its the epic drugged-out setpiece in which Jordan and Donnie experience a delayed reaction to decades-old Quaaludes obliterating their motor skills and culminating in an explosively funny battle for control of a kitchen telephone. This live-action variation on the old Looney Tunes cartoon in which Bugs Bunny and the mad scientist get high on ether fumes reveals heretofore unknown reserves of physical comedy in DiCaprio. But more than being just a great gag its a representative image Call it infantile capitalism. Despite its high price tag the pics physical production is more modestly scaled than the likes of ""The Aviator"" ""Gangs of New York"" and ""Hugo"" save for one elaborate CG-intensive sequence in which Belforts yacht nearly capsizes in a violent Mediterranean storm. Otherwise most of the movie is confined to trading floors boardrooms and suburban McMansions rendered by Prieto and production designer Bob Shaw (""Boardwalk Empire"" ""The Sopranos"") with the bright Windexed sheen of strip-mall office-park America. The redoubtable costume designer Sandy Powell has everyone looking suitably snazzy in keeping with Stratton Oakmonts policy of inhouse custom tailoring for its employees.

Reply Carl White says January 4 2014 at 423 pm This was a very entertaining but ultimately very disappointing mess of a film. Somewhere in this mess is a great film you can feel it but Mr Scorsese seems to have put the pieces of the puzzle in all the wrong places. It almost feels like he was trying too hard to entertain and forgot to simply tell the story. Slow down Scorsese just take your time and tell the story next time. I would still recommend you see it but the whole is much less than the sum of its parts. Reply MaceyJ says December 30 2013 at 141 pm Loved the performance...Loved the movie..Arguably the top 5 movies of 2013 for me.

It was a torturous waste of time. Reply shortdwarfcom (shortdwarfcom) says December 28 2013 at 435 pm looking forward to reviewing this as it has similarities to the thomas bruderman / fidelity bachelor party of 2003 in miami beach complete with dwarf-tossing Reply Sapi mann says December 27 2013 at 1220 am Loved Leos over the top performance dont always but shame on Martin Scorsese for not editing this film It was way too long incorporated too many drug fueled scenes that were yes redundant turned into the perfect storm. No reason that should have been in and taken up so many minutes with no real consequence. It seemed amateur filmmaking from a first time try. It was just brutal to think it was ending over and over and he kept trying to wring the neck out of Leos character til we the audience wanted to strangle this overindulgent brat director for never ever ending the inevitable. Never ever should have been three hours. Reply Ellen Janois says December 26 2013 at 939 pm Just returned from seeing this amp; it was too long too repetitive amp; all over the map. Dont bother.

Thank you Reply have not seen worse do not waste your money says December 25 2013 at 719 pm This movie stinks it long repetitive graphic and lacks any plot other sex and steeling from the common man. It could not be a worse movie to see on Christmas Reply Julian says December 20 2013 at 149 pm Its Mad Men on crack. And its pretty spectacular. A wild ride glossing over the bad with a soft landing and painless exit. Classic Wall Street... I thought it hit the mark exactly. Reply petrescucosmin says December 20 2013 at 106 pm The last few Scorsese pics left me a little disappointed. I had begun to think Marty had become a gun for hire and that his brilliance may have been spent (his earlier works were some of the best movies ever made). I attended a screening of The Wolf of Wall Street this evening and was expecting to be unimpressed. I am happy to say I was completely blown away. This pic is Marty at his best. I laughed I cringed I related (with fond memories as well as a bit of guilt) and I TOTALLY believed every unbelievable moment. A good book a great screenplay and a delightful cast were formed and molded into what I believe should get Scorsese a best director Oscar and likely a Best Picture Award for the movie. Leo DiCaprio has grown into a versatile actor and his creation of this super hero dirtbags roller coaster ride in this crazy (true) story is really honest and delightfully entertaining. Jonah Hill pulled out all the stops too and this is definitely his best work. Thank you Mr. Scorsese for delivering the goods so brilliantly More about the movie you can also find it here http//movieinfodb.com/en/movie/106646/The+Wolf+of+Wall+Street-2013 Reply Rev. Jeff Grant says December 19 2013 at 953 pm We have the first ministries in the US to support the families of persons accused or convicted of white-collar and other nonviolent crimes. As see it the biggest tragedy of all about white-collar and nonviolent crime is not how big the matter is or sensationalized the headlines - it is in our failure to see it as a human story with real people real brokenness and real families left behind. I went to prison for a white-collar crime myself so I am especially concerned that this movie does nothing to help. Rev.

Dont make me read the whole thing. ugh Reply Andrew says December 18 2013 at 539 am Reblogged this on Andrew J. Patrick and commented This actually looks interesting... Reply Samuel Bowles says December 18 2013 at 338 am Mr. Foundas The idea that the film has ""several conspicuous continuity gaffes and badly matched cuts throughout the film"" because Scorsese and Schoonmaker were working too quickly is ridiculous. Scorsese is known for favouring emotion over continuity when editing. Its simple he doesnt care if shots dont perfectly match if he feels the cut is right. These ""errors"" feature throughout his work and this may sound a little harsh but the Chief Film Critic for Variety being unaware of this basic facet of Americas most acclaimed mainstream modern filmmaker is somewhat alarming. Peace. Reply Robert Brooks says December 18 2013 at 315 am Just finished the book last week Its 500 pages of hedonism infidelity crime drug abuse in the extreme and more crime...But it is a fantastic read and Belfort while being a sort of nudge with short-man syndrome is a likable guy..Marty will do it justice as he is one of the great directors...I lived and worked through the 80s/90s and had a couple girlfriends in brokerage houses....THIS GUY PUTS THEM ALL TO SHAME  )...Guaranteed to like the movie if you dont mind watching someone else self destruct sort of... ) Reply Paul Vincent Zecchino says December 18 2013 at 247 am The star of this film squeaks and scolds Americans for driving while he jets off to his private island off Belize to save the planet. Tedious. Very tedious. The director makes yet another film about lowlife criminals who always end up on their feet while the American people end up footing the bill for their larcenous behavior. Why would anyone waste time and money watching a film about yet another pack of thugs whove cost us our wealth and liberty? Theres too many decent hard working people in the financial industry wholl never be glorified like this because theyre decent because they benefit us. Nope we get to watch lowlives doing what they do and the money we pay for the privilege of watching these spoiled brats of the big screen is in turn handed to left wing politicians and subversive causes which cost us yet more liberty and wealth. Forget it. Why feed the beast?

Reply James says December 17 2013 at 956 pm Which rock? One of the over 10 billion hits in the last one year or one of the 29 million in the last 24 hours?

King Babalou says December 17 2013 at 625 pm Good lord this review was longer than the movie Reply Leon A Davis says December 17 2013 at 437 pm Has anyone stopped to think what people in other countries must be thinking about America when movies like this hit their theaters? After see a dozen movies like this will they have a higher opinion of America or a lower opinion? Now one might say it doesnt really matter what anyone else thinks about the US because its the lone superpower calling all the shots in the world. Okay maybe so. But what happens when Bush or Obama sends an army to a country and says ""because America is a superior culture we know how to run your affairs better than you do so stand aside because were taking over."" That was Bushs reason for invading Iraq and Hillarys reason for the Arab Spring in Syria and Egypt and Obamas rationale for whacking out Colonel Gaddafi. Its just something to think about thats all... Reply Bill Williams says December 17 2013 at 1145 pm Leon imagine what the world would be like if China Argentina or God forbid Belgium was the worlds strongest and richest nation. Yuck. Reply Lola Guin says December 17 2013 at 538 pm Leon A Davis- I completely agree with you concerning our countrys incessant desire to police the world. I take issue with it too. However I couldnt care less what other countries think of us. A lion does not concern itself with the opinions of the mouse. America is the most powerful country on the planet and were hated for it. We the people who dont make major policy decisions are hated for it. I protested Bush and his failed wars and now Im protesting Obama and his even more destructive policies. Foreigners still hate Americans. So for me personally Im not really affected by their opinions as they have no effect on me. I am in total agreement about our foreign policy though. Our men and women belong at home protecting our borders from the current invasion not thousands of miles away in some desert hell-hole guarding opium poppy fields and lithium deposits. That serves someones interests but those interests certainly dont belong to the American people yet were stuck footing the bill. I care about that but not about the opinions of people who dont live here. Reply LOL says December 17 2013 at 1233 pm Honestly Scorsese since the beginning of this decade has been a serious let-down. He needs to stop making these 100 million bloated movies that play to Academy darlings and either go small and focussed or simply retire. The last proper Scorsese picture was Brining out the Dead and even that needed better dramatic clarity. This movie looks like a freewheeling Scorsese by numbers movie that couldve been made by others keen on mimicking his style. That is the ultimate problem younger filmmakers weaned on his films have come along and can match his cinematic flair sometimes even better than the master himself can nowadays. His hearts not in it. He said so himself. Nonetheless American cinema will be a crapper place without him. Reply zeus says December 17 2013 at 724 pm it isn too far from the urinal right now bloated portraits at how stupid we are so the darling little fascists can show their faces. diletti inhumani- wait till your grandkids are left with the plans and policies in place- start reading the Congressional Rags all of you living on cheap insurance in flood fire and disaster prone areas are gonig to get a pretty rude kick in the arse when you see what happens to the Govt subsidized disaster insurance see the following FEMA gov site all you Malibu Temescal Canyon Palisades and smell the coffee the rates for some of you will be...They have a workup shee so you can see for yourself the 40K + rate you are going to get and it only gets worse year after year or another disaster you may have a bond the bank wont cover even you big stars I have noticed the big movies last a few weeks and then are no longer aspecial engagement but at a theatre near you or already turned over to DVD and Netflix Reply erwin says December 18 2013 at 712 am i could not have said it any better. in the days when scorcese and deniro made a movie every other year or so i looked forward to them eagerly and was rarely disappointed. casino was the first false note i can recall but it was not terrible - just highly flawed. departed was entertaining (when nicholson was on screen at least) but fell apart toward the end. since then scorceses movies strike me as little better than very expensive mtv long form videos. and of course deniro destroyed his reputation 15 years ago or more J.E.Vizzusi says December 17 2013 at 948 am More white powder than Black Bear the East Coasters will have to look that one up Christmas Im not thinking about a MS Film although I fall into the perfect demographics. Longest review I have ever read on Variety a sorta bio-pic upon itself. Leo is never quite right for the jump cut mentality of this most honored NYC Director. Hopefully that will change here. I look forward very much to a return of a true MS Directed Film we all once knew. Note Spike Jonz is credited on IMDB. Great Review.. jv Reply J says December 17 2013 at 815 am Interesting point about the continuity issues but your conclusion regarding them may be incorrect. A lot of Scorseses acclaimed films (like Goodfellas Gangs of New York or The Departed) are riddled with obvious continuity errors. Its no secret that Scorsese and Schoonmaker openly opt for the proper emotion/energy in a take over continuity.
