(Hopper Stone/Bleecker Street) Al Pacino stars as Danny Collins in Dan Fogelmans drama about an aging rock star who cant stop wanting to be adored.(Hopper Stone/Bleecker Street) Danny Collins A rock stars battle with time and fall from the limelight Add to ... Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Apr. 10 2015 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Apr. 10 2015 1200AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Dan Fogelman Written by Dan Fogelman Starring Al Pacino Annette Bening Christopher Plummer and Bobby Cannavale Classification 14A Country USA Language English Al Pacino once an heir to the Marlon Brando method crown has become increasingly emphatic with the passing decades his volume rising along with his hairdo refusing to be ignored. With Danny Collins the 74-year-old actor gives us the full Pacino Its one of those Quaker Oats box-like regressive experiences a celebrity playing a celebrity whos sort of modelled on himself. Furious 7 - the seventh installment of the Fast and Furious movie franchise - raced to the top of the U.S. box office picking up a massive 143.6 million in its opening weekend. Andrew Bell has more. BNN Video Video Video Furious 7 cruises to top of U.S. weekend box office The movie about an aging rock star trying to recover his artistic mojo is the directorial debut of Dan Fogelman best known as a prolific writer of corny successful movies (Cars 2 The Guilt Trip Tangled Last Vegas Crazy Stupid Love). The plot of Danny Collins though loosely based on a real incident follows the pattern though it occasionally sucker punches you with an emotionally authentic moment.In 2005 English folksinger Steve Tilston finally received a letter which had been written to him 34 years before by John Lennon. Lennon was responding to a magazine interview in which the young Tilston speculated that success probably would spoil his art; Lennon disagreed telling him his integrity was up to him to maintain.Fogelmans script serves as an alternative history in which a one-time sensitive singer-songwriter (we see a young Pacino lookalike in an interview back in 1971) achieves his dreams and sells out. Not to make too fine a point of it we see the words ""Sold Out"" on a marquee of a theatre where the aging Danny Collins is in his dressing room getting ready to perform. Squished into a girdle sporting dyed black hair and an orange booth tan he wears a big cross around his neck; the cross which is also where he stashes his cocaine. Onstage Danny Collins is like a lower-carat Neil Diamond sashaying about and croaking out his golden oldies to an adoring gray-haired audience.The singers life-changing moment comes when Dannys crusty old manager Frank (Christopher Plummer) gives him a birthday present a long-lost letter from Lennon telling Danny to ""stay true to yourself."" The singer takes it as a late-life wake-up call. He says goodbye to his latest gold-digging young fiancee hops on his private jet to New Jersey and assumes his version of the humble life He rents a suite at the Hilton where he installs a baby grand piano to become reacquainted with his muse. He also plays matchmaker between the bellboy and the concierge and flirts with the sensible middle-aged hotel manager Mary (Annette Bening) who calls him ""ridiculous"" but screws up her eyes and giggles girlishly at everything he says.Dannys real reason for moving to New Jersey is to reconnect with his estranged son Tom (Bobby Cannavale) a 40-year-old construction worker who has a hyperactive five-year-old daughter with special needs a very pregnant wife Samantha (Jennifer Garner) and a looming personal crisis.Between Dannys attempts to ingratiate himself with his new family and the hotel staff the movie bobbles between sitcom cuteness and melodrama with Fogelman throwing bits of off-beat dialogue and plot turns to avoid complete predictability. Put aside the overall mawkishness and there are some fine quiet exchanges between Pacino as a guy who cant stop wanting to be adored and Cannavale a stubborn grown-up child.One of the things that partly excuses the movies mush is that its a kind of musical. The songs include Dannys chestnut Hey Baby Doll (written by Ciaran Gribbin) which echoes Neil Diamonds Sweet Caroline. Dannys would-be comeback song is an introspective Leonard Cohen-like ballad called Dont Look Down (by Don Was and Ryan Adams) and nine of the songs on the soundtrack linked to dramatic moments are from Lennons post-Beatles career. Those include Imagine which was the movies original title and wrap up fittingly with Instant Karma a song by a rock star who decided to get serious about his lifes decisions.

Audiences crave his old hits so he hasnt written a new song in years. Hes definitely a character on the Rod Stewart-Keith Richards continuum.But then his longtime manager (Christopher Plummer) gives him a surprise birthday gift A letter John Lennon wrote to the young Danny in 1971 that was never passed on.Danny immediately recognizes what a waste hes made of his life. So he hires a private jet flies to New Jersey rents a red Mercedes sports car and checks into a suburban Hilton hotel way beneath his pay grade.Why? Because it turns out he has a full-grown son (Bobby Cannavale) hes never met as well as a daughter-in-law (Jennifer Garner) and hyper-adorable granddaughter (Giselle Eisenberg).These folks are somewhat hesitant initially in embracing famous Grandpa but Danny makes new friends at the hotel to keep his spirits up most notably with the prim hotel manager (Annette Bening).He also starts writing songs again.The story takes a turn toward melodrama as Danny tries to win over his resentful son but writer-director Dan Fogelman (""Crazy Stupid Love"") keeps that Pacino charm up front even when things go dark. Really some of the films best moments are just Danny exchanging patter with the hotels employees.Of course patter only takes you so far. ""Danny Collins"" is the cinematic equivalent of a well-sung easy rock tune enjoyably light and bouncy with some darker notes hidden within the chords.Nice stuff Al.TLongdetroitnews.comtwitter.com/toomuchTomLongDanny CollinsGRADE BRated R for language drug use and some nudityRunning time 106 minutes 80 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1IXvXhx MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2015/04/03/al-pacino-rocks-charming-danny-collins/70853192/,200,dannycollins1,dannycollins,detroitnews

Its a treacly paint-by-numbers redemption story about an aging rock star who wants to change his life for the better; a terrific cast takes that sitcom dross and spins it into -- well maybe not gold but at least gold-plated. This thing turns out better than youd expect. Al Pacino as the ridiculous Danny Collins will make you laugh in spite of yourself. Moussed spray-tanned and corseted Collins is an aging rock star content to rest on the laurels of his Greatest Hits forever. His concerts are packed with aging baby boomers and he hasnt written or sung anything original in eons. But who cares? Dannys fans are legion he still makes tons of money and his best friend and manager is played by a wiseacre Christopher Plummer. Doesnt get much better than that until ... The discovery that John Lennon -- yes that John Lennon -- sent him a fan letter in 1971 that never got delivered sends Danny into mid-life crisis. What if theyd met? What sort of life and career would Danny have had then? Mobile users please click here. He runs off to small-town New Jersey where the locals at the hotel are stunned to find a rock icon in their midst. Danny wants a quiet place to start writing songs again. And he picked New Jersey in hopes of finally encountering his adult son a person hes never met. His son was the result of a one-night stand with a fan and well -- Dannys hoping to play catch-up after some 30 years. Getting past the estrangement and toward a relationship with this son is where director/screenwriter Dan Fogelman (who penned Crazy Stupid Love) really starts laying it on with a trowel so lets cut to the chase the son is played by Bobby Cannavale and the sons pregnant wife is played by Jennifer Garner. If those two actors arent enough to win an audience over (and they are) the whole redemption scenario is overseen by Annette Bening who plays the manager of the hotel where Danny stays in New Jersey. Thats just talent overkill. And then theres Pacino who is easy-breezy here self-effacing silly -- and attractive for it. People always say story first but Danny Collins is proof that the right cast can perform miracles. For his directorial debut Fogelman puts all the right people together and whats more gets a performance out of Pacino thats one of his best-ever comic turns. All this with a total sitcom story.

Special to Newsday + - Christopher Plummer and Al Pacino in ""Danny Collins."" Photo Credit TNS / Hopper Stone advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Aging rock star gets a long-delayed letter from John Lennon which prompts him to reassess his life. (Rated R for language drug use nudity) BOTTOM LINE Pacinos exuberance rescues Dan Fogelmans directing debut from the schematic snares in Fogelmans script. CAST Al Pacino Annette Bening Bobby Canavale Christopher Plummer LENGTH 146 Al Pacino playing an overripe rock star ruing his misspent youth (and middle age) might seem like an opportunity for enthusiastic hoo-hah-ing and a whole lotta ACTING in capital letters. But the saving grace of ""Danny Collins"" is that Pacino is playing a performer one whose overly large self is perfectly plausible. Danny is a rock and roller whose biggest records are well behind him but whose devoted fans still turn out in droves to hear his hits. So Danny 40 years past his prime and recycling like crazy is still rolling in money women and cocaine. Life may be shallow but its sweet. And then a letter turns up 40 years after it was sent telling a young promising Danny to be true to his art to never compromise his talent. The writer John Lennon. (The incident is based on a true story and a real Lennon letter to English folk singer Steve Tilston.) Danny looks at his life at its trail of broken promises and unmet potential and decides to make amends. advertisement | advertise on newsday Yes its a surefire recipe for schmaltz. But Pacino makes Danny into a man who knows exactly what he is and how and why he appeals to people -- after all Danny is Mr. Show Biz whos been cultivating his persona and making calculations about people his whole life. So when he seeks out the son he abandoned (Bobby Cannavale) Danny expects to be rebuffed and to eventually get his way; when Danny takes a shine to the beautiful manager (Annette Bening) at the hotel where he sets himself up he knows hell charm his way past her misgivings about his wastrel ways. More movie reviewsLatest movie reviews Dan Fogelmans script hits all the predictable plot points en route to Dannys Waterloo with his own ego and uncertainties but theres also an honesty about how the hero deals with his son his daughter-in-law (Jennifer Garner) and their daughter who needs the kind of special help only Danny can afford. The relationship between Danny and his longtime manager (a first-rate Christopher Plummer) feels right their history being all about ego-wrangling and self-indulgence. And the film avoids any easy roads to redemption -- Dannys attempt to reinvent himself is just as hard as it should be. For all his unchained charm Pacino also provides an appropriate amount of pain.

"Danny Collins stars Al Pacino as an aging singer rocked by John Lennons delayed karma review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesDanny Collins stars Al Pacino as an aging singer rocked by John Lennons delayed karma reviewAl Pacino plays an aging rocker whose past catches up with him in various ways in Danny Collins.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. April 9 2015Danny CollinsStarring Al Pacino Annette Bening Christopher Plummer Jennifer Garner and Bobby Cannavale. Directed by Dan Fogelman. 107 minutes. Opening Friday at major theatres. 14AThe marquee reads ""Danny Collins Sold Out.""It also serves as a definition of the artistic integrity of aging rocker Danny played with slick zeal by Al Pacino in Danny Collins. Hes a soft-middled Tom Jones sort whos been packing stadiums and his bank account on the strength of formula-written singalong hits for more than 30 years. Article Continued BelowScreenwriter Dan Fogelman (The Guilt Trip;Crazy Stupid Love) directing for the first time here was inspired by real-life British folksinger Steve Tilston who worried about fame in a magazine interview. John Lennon (and Yoko Ono) wrote Tilston a letter in response only discovered decades after the singer-songwriters death.Christopher Plummer Al Pacino and Katarina Cas appear in Danny Collins.  (Hopper Stone / TNS)  Slope-shouldered and leading with his pouchy tummy as he shuffles along Danny relies on spray tans good hair and coke to keep stage ready and drown out doubts. He could have been a Bob Dylan-style troubadour; instead hes singing his gooey hit ditty ""Hey Baby Doll"" to packed houses of swaying seniors. The moneys good but the soul-stealing is getting harder to bear.In his ""plus"" column theres the hot young fiance fancy cars and an L.A. mansion. But only his longtime manager and best friend Frank (Christopher Plummer in fine form here) tells him the truth about how things are.When the letter Lennon wrote after reading Dannys self-doubting freshman magazine interview finally catches up with him 40 years later it sparks a change. Danny decides to hole up in of all places a New Jersey Hilton where he can write meaningful songs in his room and get his mojo back along with free Wi-Fi.The place has a nice lobby bar and a smart and lively hotel manager Mary Sinclair (Annette Bening) who catches Dannys eye. She quickly proves shes no pushover but Danny likes a challenge.Turns out hes not just in Jersey for the nightlife. Since you cant have a movie about an aging rocker without including a reunion with a long-lost kid its time for Danny to reconnect with his adult son Tom (Bobby Cannavale) a product of a long-ago backstage encounter.Tom has never met his phantom father and wants no part of him although his pregnant wife Samantha (Jennifer Garner) is prepared to be convinced. Their cute but often-frantic daughter Hope provides a good way for Danny to insert himself into their lives.As fun as it is to watch Pacino enjoying himself onscreen hes never convincing as a rock star. He may be one of the worlds greatest actors but his onstage take on the classic band welcome to screaming fans ""Hello L.A."" sounds like hes calling bingo rather that pushing it to 11.Director Fogelman keeps it simple and surprise-free right down to the heavily engineered romance between two hotel employees and repeating themes about the past catching up with you frame most of the action. Karma instant or delayed is a you-know-what man.But its never dull to watch pros like Pacino Bening Plummer Garner and Cannavale interact -- this is dream casting -- and the film makes the most of that along with a pleasingly comprehensive Lennon soundtrack. As a result Danny Collins works despite predictability and some overly sentimental patches.

EntertainmentMovies Danny Collins Al Pacino unleashed as aging pop star Originally published April 2 2015 at 315 pm Updated April 29 2015 at 258 pm Al Pacino (with Christopher Plummer left and Katarina Cas) charms as an aging rock star in (Hopper Stone/Hopper Stone SMPSP) A review of Dan Fogelmans dramedy ""Danny Collins."" Rating 2.5 stars out of 4. Share story By Moira Macdonald Seattle Times movie critic Much of Dan Fogelmans dramedy ""Danny Collins"" involves watching Al Pacino wander around in flashy suits being charming to people in a very larger-than-life make-sure-they-can-see-me-in-the-back-row kind of way -- and lets just admit it you can probably think of worse ways to spend the better part of two hours. (Or maybe you cant in which case this isnt your movie.) Pacino plays the title character a coked-up version of Neil Diamond crossed with Tom Jones an aging pop star whos getting tired of singing the same signature songs to blue-haired Vegas audiences. After hitting a milestone birthday (too hard) and being unexpectedly presented with a letter to his 20-something self from John Lennon Danny has one of those revelations so beloved of screenwriters He wants to rethink his life reconnect with the son he never knew and perhaps become a better man. That he does so should come as no surprise; weve all seen movies like this before. ""Danny Collins"" leans a little too hard on the charm Everyone Danny meets -- his estranged son (Bobby Cannavale) daughter-in-law (Jennifer Garner) and young granddaughter (Giselle Eisenberg) as well as the ever-smiling manager (Annette Bening) and staff of the New Jersey Hilton in which Danny holes up -- is unfailingly nice. (This is the kind of movie in which the ever-so-cute grandkids name is -- wait for it -- Hope.) Movie Review 1/2   Danny Collins with Al Pacino Annette Bening Jennifer Garner Bobby Cannavale Christopher Plummer. Written and directed by Dan Fogelman. 106 minutes. Rated R for language drug use and some nudity. Several theaters. But its fun watching Pacino sashay around in his necklaces and pinstripes and eyebrows flirting with the help and making Bening giggle and hes got some great clash-of-the-titans scenes with Christopher Plummer who plays Dannys longtime manager. And Cannavale has one wonderful moment thats so poignant -- staring wordlessly at his daughter late in the film with a look of such sadness and decency and yes hope -- that you forgive ""Danny Collins"" its excesses. Like its hero the movie is flawed but hard to resist. Most Read StoriesThinking of voting for Jill Stein or Gary Johnson?

Updated July 29 2016  1053 pm Full Forecast News Sports Business Go Life Buy/Sell Movie reviews Danny Collins imagines Al Pacino as a rock star By Joe Williams / film critic / joewilliamspost-dispatch.com Joe Williams Apr 2 2015 (...) Al Pacino is a rock star among actors. And not necessarily in a good way. Like the singer he plays in ""Danny Collins"" Pacino is prone to coasting through performances regurgitating his greatest hits for an audience of aging pushovers. (Exhibit A ""Stand-Up Guys."") But the lesson of this likable little movie is that its never too late to reclaim your integrity.Danny has all the standard rock-star accessories; a 20-something girlfriend a cocaine habit a truss. Imagine the lifestyle of Rod Stewart and the repertoire of Neil Diamond. (His treacly hit beloved by all the grannies is called ""Sweet Baby Doll"" and it will infest your dreams.)For his latest uncountable birthday Danny gets a smack upside the head. It comes in the form of a long-lost letter. More than 40 years earlier Danny had been an up-and-coming folk singer and lamented in a magazine article that he was worried about becoming a sellout. John Lennon read the article and sent the magazine a letter urging Danny to be true to his art. But the editor kept the letter. It eventually ended up in an auction where it was bought by Dannys ever-loyal manager (Christopher Plummer). When Danny reads the letter from his hero Lennon he vows to change his ways. That means giving the unfaithful girlfriend a no-hard-feelings send-off and flying to New Jersey to find the now-grown son he never met.Tom (Bobby Cannavale a standout) is the product of a long-ago fling. He lives a working class life with wife Samantha (Jennifer Garner) and hyperactive daughter Hope (Giselle Eisenberg). Although his late mother said his father was a rock star Tom wants nothing to do with the rich visitor who offers to pay for Hopes education. But Danny is stubborn and he hunkers down in a nearby hotel to write songs and map out his new mature lifestyle. That where he meets hotel manager Mary (Annette Bening) with whom he has an age-appropriate flirtation. It stretches credibility that a letter from another rock star could rewire Dannys coke-addled libido and reorient his moral compass and the miscast Pacino is somewhat hard to swallow in both the Before and After modes yet this is loosely based on a true story.In real life the intended recipient of Lennons 1971 letter was an English folk singer named Steve Tilston. Unaware of the letter until 2005 Tilston has enjoyed a niche career but unlike Danny he has never had to deal with fame and fortune. So like the producers of this feel-good fantasy Tilston cannot fully understand the truth of Lennons words ""Being rich doesnt change your experience in the way you think.""What ""Danny Collins""  Two and a half stars out of four  Run time 146  Rating R  Content language drug use and some nudity Joe Williams  314-340-8344Film criticjoethecritic on Twitterjoewilliamspost-dispatch.com Videos Arts Pop Joe Williams talks new movie Danny Collins Apr 1 2015 (...)

"When Orange Calls for Black The Racial and Sexual Impotence of Get Hard. Plus Al Pacino Is Great Again << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com When Orange Calls for Black The Racial and Sexual Impotence of Get Hard. Plus Al Pacino Is Great Again Warner Bros. Movies March 27 2015 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print The first 15 minutes of Get Hard set the stage for a nutty social farce like Trading Places. Will Ferrell plays James King a senior hedge fund manager with a Los Angeles palace and a sexy young fiancee. Kevin Hart is Darnell the guy who runs the parking garage beneath Jamess office building. One afternoon Darnell taps on Jamess car window to get his attention and give him the keys and James lets out a long frightened scream. He doesnt bother to turn around to see who it is. He doesnt have to. The movie has so perfectly set up Jamess affluent white aloofness that its clear that the mere prospect of contact with a nonwhite person (Darnell is black) would terrify him. In the same scene Darnell asks James to consider buying a lifetime platinum membership to the struggling car wash Darnell operates. It costs 30000. James demurs. Instead he gives Darnell a lecture about investing. In a matter of years James could turn that money into 3 million. Moreover unlike Darnell he didnt ask for handouts to get where he is. (He simply accepted them from his father but never mind.) The point is Why doesnt Darnell work harder to get where he wants to go? An exchange like this is such a classic talking (down) point between the classes (and by extension between races) that the movie can afford to keep its barely straight face. Were getting the joke. It helps that the person visible in Ferrells caricature suggests a refurbished device whose original software was unsuccessfully wiped. Only loosely is James an asshole. So when the big dogs at his firm -- including his future father-in-law played by Craig T. Nelson and Greg Germann as house counsel -- frame him for fraud and embezzlement you feel for him. And the movie taps into the publics outrage over economic inequality. With all of Ferrells sponge-haired oafish ersatz innocence James insists that he intends to fight the charges against him. But at trial the judge throws the book at him 10 years at San Quentin. Its meant to be a message to the whole financial world. Indeed victims bilked by Jamess firm show up after the trial and bang on his Town Car. The sentence includes a month to prepare for prison. The movie strikes a cathartic balance between absurdity and some kind of injustice. In a montage you see Ferrell in a 1 percenters despair. One very funny shot has him weeping trying to drink a glass of red while vibrating in a recliner. His accounts are frozen. His sexy fiancee (Alison Brie pampered but sharp) leaves him. He puts on a wig and mustache and tries to flee. These scenes are all so well done so tasting of ill-gotten upper-crustiness that you want to know where the rest of this movie is going. But if youre at Get Hard you probably already know racial-stereotype reinforcement. Darnell finds James stuffed in the trunk of a car in the office garage (James was on the run). James explains his situation. Darnell already knows. James presumes Darnell can relate because Darnell is black and is working this menial job and according to James one in three black American men goes to prison. So statistically speaking isnt Darnell likely to be an ex-con? Darnell takes umbrage in that catching-the-Holy Spirit way that is Harts specialty. He summons for James a fulminating pantomime of the endless sex that awaits James behind bars. James offers Darnell 30000 for a crash course in how to avoid it. Even with that ridiculous premise declared youre intrigued. In the next scene were at Darnells for the first time where his wife Rita (Edwina Findley Dickerson as good as Brie but with a lot less to do) is expressing disbelief about Darnells plan. ""What do you know about prison?"" she asks. Attempting to act tough he calls her a bitch and she hauls off and smacks him. But as the movie proceeds the intrigue dissipates. Darnell calls a cousin for tips and tells James the plot of Boyz n the Hood as if it were the story of his life. The prison school Darnell concocts turns Jamess mansion into a makeshift maximum-security facility built by Jamess Latin staff played by some funny actors who are only barely allowed in on the jokes. One of the houses studies becomes Jamess cell. One of the tennis courts turns into a prison yard. The school stuff is loaded with dismaying coursework featuring scores of rape jokes and culminating in a prison-yard scenario in which Ferrell is bombarded by Harts impersonations of three inmate archetypes gangsta cholo fairy. Get Hard turns out to be a far cry from something like Trading Places or even the clever first half of the class-insurrection comedy of Tower Heist. Its freewheeling street-approved tourism is closer to the white-dude-in-the-hood flagrancy of Jamie Kennedy as a ""wanksta"" in Malibus Most Wanted which is a slightly more tolerable piece of racial cynicism. Trading Places is the kind of white-liberal fantasy that brought us Diffrent Strokes and Webster but it also had a fizzy distrusting intelligence that Get Hard lacks. The problem with this movie is that you keep waiting for it to turn the premise and its presumptions upside down but it never gets even part of the way there. The writing doesnt think much of Darnell. Compared with James he has no talent or skill. (Hes not even a good impostor ex-convict.) We learn about Jamess educational background and peers; its for laughs but its still information that tells you who this guy is. Despite his being framed and convicted James has a way with math and money. We see him apply it. What ultimately is Darnell good at? Ferrell and Hart share this movie but the writing for them is hardly equal. I dont know what Hart is supposed to be playing. Hes just the industrys idea of A Black Person. Just about all the nonwhite workers we see work for James. Darnells wife Rita is a nurse but the only time we hear about her work is after James gets himself a gross boo-boo. The movie is actually presenting Darnell as the ambitionless peon James presumes him to be. By the time he takes James to see his ex-con gangsta cousin Russell (T.I.) for a possible ride-along drive-by Darnell seems smart only compared to the dummies in Russells crew. The one crime-free black male has to pretend to be bad to prevent a good white guy from having worse things happen to him -- and all for our entertainment. More might be demanded of this movie if Jamie Foxx were playing James. But that movie would never get made. The script is credited to the movies director Etan Cohen as well as to Jay Martel and Ian Roberts both of whom are the executive producers for Comedy Centrals absurdist racial kaleidoscope of a sketch show Key amp; Peele. (All of whom are white.) The smart class-warfare setup erodes into another helping of sexually paranoid bromance one chafed by the quills of race and typical of Ferrells lack of intra-male boundaries. Most of Darnells personal training involves Jamess being readied to defend against assault. He dispatches James to fight strangers as some people might break in a pit bull. He lets James use him as a barbell to do bench presses. But he also takes James to solicit blow jobs at ""L.A.s flirtiest gay brunch."" While James is in a bathroom stall falling into a strangers crotch Darnell is back in the garden getting picked up by a guy (T.J. Jagodowski) who wont take no for an answer. The scene manages split-level comedy -- its both homophobic and homo-curious in a way thats disorienting yet fascinating. Hart isnt playing contempt at that gay brunch. Hes insulted because the guy isnt as good-looking as Darnell believes himself to be. But his exasperation vaguely pays off four or five scenes later in a tacked-on moment that reminds you once again that Hart can be a breathtakingly tender star. When James embraces Darnell and tells him he got hard thinking about him youre surprised the double entendre doesnt make Hart recoil. Ferrell says it over and over and every time little Hart gets a bit more lost in Ferrells big embrace. It all points toward an inauthentic but perversely warm half-step forward for so-called bromance an advance that makes you wonder whether the movies will figure out as the country as a whole currently is how to be comfortable about homosexuality before achieving comfort with race. This movie opens the same week that HBO announced that it wont renew Looking its slow-burning romantic comedy about the lives of actual gay men. The ratings were poor. But when youre seeing Ferrell and Hart feeling on each other and all but falling in love the impending absence of that show -- and its reality -- stings. Get Hard knows how to screw around. But when it comes to anything more it lacks the balls to fuck.  Danny Collins Productions Theres a kind of modest American comedy thats so keenly done that you dont bother resisting. All the details feel exactly right for that particular story and those characters. It just works. Right away you can tell that Danny Collins is working. The editing and camerawork establish an easy storytelling rhythm. Theres wit in the writing. The actors are alert and into their roles. Theres not a lot going on and that turns out to be to its advantage. It keeps surprising you. In the opening sequence a pop singer named Danny Collins (Al Pacino) whos been very famous for four decades has just finished punching the air at another ecstatically sold-out show. As he barely sings his biggest hit he sways his old bones back and forth like a Margaritaville Jolly Roger. A quick cut backstage catches him looking cadaverous. Hes drunk coked up and girdled into his black pants and matching open shirt. Revelers cavort in his dressing room but not with him. Oh no I thought here comes one of those bottoming-out musical dramas. But then Dannys forever-manager (Christopher Plummer) gives him an early birthday present a framed handwritten letter that John Lennon wrote to him in the early 1970s that Danny never received. (The movie takes the premise from a similar letter that Lennon actually did write to a young British folksinger named Steve Tilston.) Danny is floored. It gets him thinking about what might have been. It makes him feel a bit like a fraud. He catches his latest wife cheating on him in the master bedroom of his gated Los Angeles fortress and decides to cancel his lucrative tour and head to New Jersey. The plan is to reintroduce himself to a grown son Tom (Bobby Cannavale) who really really doesnt want to see Danny. He makes his base of operations a Hilton in someplace called Woodcliff Lake where he passes out compliments to the dazzled staff. ""Great face"" he exclaims to Nicky the young valet (Josh Peck). With the hotel manager Mary Sinclair (Annette Bening) Danny commits to a regimen of high-intensity flattery. He makes Pepe Le Pew look like Bartleby the Scrivener. ""While youre checking me in"" he says ""Ill be checking you out."" He lays it on thick. She scrapes it off. On both the romantic and paternal fronts Dannys got his work cut out for him. Musically too. Its been 30 years since he last wrote a new song but he cant sing the old ones anymore. That big hit is something called ""Hey Baby Doll"" and the chorus is a lawsuit away from ""Sweet Caroline"" -- Splenda to Neil Diamonds sugar. To attempt to change that Danny ships a giant Steinway to his hotel suite and gets to work on what turns out to be a pretty good mood-color ballad (composed in fact by Ryan Adams). I love that Danny knows who he is. He doesnt quit abusing substances. He just cuts cocaine out of his life the way some people do carbs. He likes being a famous rock star. He loves the clothes especially the shirts he can open to the middle of his chest so that you can see the crucifix he keeps on a necklace. Even when hes sitting in the hotel bar after another tough day with Tom looking sunk hes unsinkable. Mary walks into the bar to ask him how she should handle a drunken celebrity and ends up spending the night drinking and commiserating alongside him. Who wouldnt? Danny Collins is the sort of thing that 25 or 30 years ago wouldve come out every week a low-budget low-stakes excuse for good actors to have some fun with a smart director and script (by Dan Fogelman who wrote the busy AARP-centric comedy Last Vegas). Now its such a rarity -- Pacino and Bening just relaxing together charming each other being legitimately funny but also versions of themselves -- that the sheer entertainment of it brings a tear to your eyes. Fogelman gives most of the scenes a huge emotional brightness. Theres a shot at Dannys surprise party that pans across a line of aged former showbiz guys staring agog at some nubile woman. The camera keeps going until it finds Danny in a doorway doing the same thing. The movie is full of little wonderful touches like that including the very last shot. All of the actors are good even Jennifer Garner as Samantha Toms pregnant semi-tough wife. She doesnt go for too much which is perfect since she doesnt need to. Neither does Plummer who gets snobbily bent out of shape by all of this New Jersey business. Tom and Samantha have a focus-challenged kid named Hope whos played by Giselle Eisenberg a child actor but a miracle of one; shes got comic timing makes funny faces and has real chemistry with Pacino. But everybody here has that especially Bening who somehow finds a way to give the same clenched smile about 20 different meanings. Its exciting to see a brilliant actor invent a character by thinking about what that woman does for work. Bening gets to reinvent customer service as a sterling personality trait. You get why she lowers her guard for this leathered mildly obnoxious man too Pacinos really enjoying himself. Danny is miserable but you can sense immediately that Pacino isnt playing misery. The bottom that Danny has hit is spiritual. He needs to detox his soul. Pacino makes his way through this movie granting wishes and tossing out treats like a combination used-car salesman and leprechaun. Its been years since hes been this relaxed in a movie. You dont care that he cant make rock megastardom seem possible. Pacino makes himself seem plausible as a movie star again. Forget Oscars. That deserves a toss of your underwear. This post has been updated to correct two errors The platinum membership offered to Ferrells character was a lifetime one not an annual one and Ferrells response about the money hed have otherwise refers to a sum of 3 million not 30 million.

By  Lisa Kennedy PUBLISHED March 25 2015 at 1132 am | UPDATED April 25 2016 at 311 pm Sign up for newsletters and alerts Submit your news tips or photos Most Popular Former Japanese consulate residence hits the Denver market for 4.2 million Sports Authority plans to pay top executives 2.85 million in bankruptcy bonuses Donald Trump stumps in Colorado promises ""No more Mr. Nice Guy"" Blake Shelton plays free intimate show at Denvers Grizzly Rose Tennis-ball-sized hail knocks out 27 Colorado Springs police cars Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie The beginning of the new Al Pacino flick ""Danny Collins"" has a familiarity that teases contempt. Oh no please not another aging rock-star saga not another post-midlife-crisis tale. And while the movie is in many ways just that hang with Danny on his conscience-cleansing sojourn. Because once the deeply flawed protagonist leaves behind his palatial digs in L.A. and age-inappropriate fiancee (Katarina Cas) for a New Jersey hotel room and an ill-advised visit to the adult son hes never met ""Danny Collins"" begins striking some sweet chords. Dannys soul-rattling epiphany comes in the form of a letter from John Lennon and Yoko Ono. Christopher Plummer provides the first inkling of good things as Dannys longtime manager and best friend Frank Grubman. Something in Plummers eyes his characters unfazed approach to rock-star nonsense lends ballast to a listing set-up. Frank gives Danny the long-undelivered missive from the ex-Beatle on Dannys birthday. In gratitude Danny leaves Frank to clean up the mess of canceling his lucrative U.S. tour dates. Writer-director Dan Fogelman based his script on the story of Brit rocker Steve Tilston. In 2010 a memorabilia collector approached Tilston with a letter penned in 1971. Lennon had read with interest an interview with the very young performer in which he worried about what fame may cost him artistically. Nick Offerman cuts a devilish figure as the rock n roll zine editor who tells the young Danny (Davide Donatiello) greatness is about to befall him and asks is he ready? Fogelman juxtaposes this scene with the older Danny rocking his biggest hit ""Hey Baby Doll"" for ardent fans who have aged along with him but dont have the lifestyle resources to pretend otherwise. The rest is Fogelmans ""what-if"" riff. Given its shaky start the story finds its surprisingly tender groove when Danny meets daughter-in-law Samantha (Jennifer Garner full of intelligent warmth) hyperactive granddaughter Hope (Giselle Eisenberg) and makes a songwriting nest of a hotel suite in a New Jersey. Bobby Cannavale does nicely gruff work as Tom the son born of a concert tour hook-up. Where others might see an unexpected windfall in the arrival of the contrite rocker this blue-collar contractor smells the baloney. Hes right to be suspicious. Dannys a charismatic narcissist -- an entertainer. A number of moviegoers will likely welcome the nine Lennon songs threaded through the movie. They seem superfluous. More raw true and tentative are Dannys fledging compositions. Ryan Adams is one of the films composers and songwriters. Annette Bening plays Mary the no-nonsense manager of the Wood Cliff Lake Hilton where Danny sets up shop by shipping in a baby grand Steinway. He gently hits on her with regularity. She rebuffs. Bening is amusing as she looks askance at this ridiculous grown-up from behind her glasses. It seems possible Danny hasnt been told ""no"" for decades. Tom and Mary are all about telling him ""no."" A twist bonds father and son at least more than theyve ever been before. But given Dannys character the nascent connection feels vulnerable. What Fogelman doesnt quite achieve as screenwriter at the start of the film he makes up for in his directorial debut. He supports wonderfully the affable allure of his attuned cast.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint The Public Domain [?][?][?] out of four stars Unrated but includes adult themes. Theater Lagoon. Premiere 7 p.m. Friday with red carpet filmmakers Qamp;A and afterparty. The 2007 collapse of the Interstate 35W bridge created a range of emotional aftershocks some socially visible others hidden. In this crisp touching little drama many of the consequences enter a Minneapolis bar. The Public Domain (a quintessential Northeast pub invented for the locally shot film) is where callers go to revisit time in a bottle. We enter this home away from home eight years after the disaster alongside several regulars each still coping with unique varieties of lifes fallout. The script by director Patrick Coyle doesnt try to squeeze much symbolic mileage out of the tragedy favoring character over circumstance. Emily Bridges (daughter of Beau of the famous film acting clan) plays a twenty-something writer dealing with with the pain and aggravation of childhood abuse. Guthrie Theater leading man Peter Christian Hansen plays a brother returning home to atone for years of absence. His stage colleague Mark Benninghofen is an ad agency cad trying to hold the reins of his disused marriage while riding the saddle of a hard-to-resist affair. Sara Marsh (of the Minnesota-made comedy ""Sugar and Spice"") is an actress using her looks for professional and personal advantage. Bleecker Street Media Al Pacino in ""Danny Collins."" Each subplot intersects with the next unexpectedly and even minor characters get entertaining attention. Brian Porter (""Dear White People"") adds ricochets of comic relief as a cocky journeyman actor aiming to outperform every tryout competitor. Coyle a gifted performer as well as filmmaker plays the villain of the piece a secretive peeping Tom gathering information for purposes initially unidentified. He has given us a well-crafted small budget indie touching some painful funny truths. COLIN COVERT Danny Collins [?][?] out of four stars Rated R for language drug use nudity. Theater Uptown. How bad could a movie be that features talent as serious as Al Pacino Annette Bening Christopher Plummer Bobby Cannavale and Jennifer Garner? This bad alas. In this cute but consistently stodgy opus Pacino plays a wealthy old soft rock star. Danny found his talent in the 1970s lost it through decades of hammy pop success and hopes to find it again while connecting with the man he fathered on a tour 40 years earlier. Pacino is one of the best actors in film history even now at age 74 and 11 months. Hes still got a voice strong enough to inflate big shouty parts but he can sing like your ears can chew gum. So why is he cast as an aged pop superstar? In certain ways it makes sense. The film gives Pacino a rare chance to play an avuncular chuckling glad-handing codger. His scenes with Dannys youthful foreign lover (nice work by Yugoslovias Katarina Cas) are an amusing in-joke given Pacinos long personal relationship with Argentine beauty Lucila Sola. But he cant sell a musical scene. Writer/director Dan Fogelman who created the age comedies ""The Guilt Trip"" and ""Last Vegas"" gives us a redemption love story too cute for its own good. When his manager and lifelong friend Frank (Plummer) gives Danny a long lost message sent to him by his idol John Lennon the handwritten fan letter inspires him. He eases up on his appetite for alcohol and cocaine. He travels from L.A. splendor to blue-collar New Jersey with heartfelt apologies and lavish big-ticket gifts for his construction worker son Tom (Cannavale) and Toms pregnant wife (Garner). He shares his chagrin at Toms long-simmering resentment with the hostess of his East Coast Hilton Mary (Bening) a bright age-appropriate replacement for his young girlfriend. With Lennon songs popping up across the soundtrack like so much hotel Muzak the film is ultimately more about celebrity. C.C. SERENA [?] out of four stars Rated R for violence sexual situations. Theater Lagoon. Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper signed on to this indie before they became two of Americas most recognizable actors. But Susanne Biers dark drama is a real slog. The movie is set during the Great Depression around the Smoky Mountains where George Pemberton (Cooper) runs a timber enterprise. He returns from a vacation with a young bride Serena (Lawrence) a spitfire whose late father was also a logging man. Cooper and Lawrence do their best but the material consistently works against them from the overwrought dialogue to the never-ending plot twists. The movie feels a little bit like a logging version of ""There Will Be Blood"" except that the characters in this study arent really worth consideration.

(AP Photo/Bleecker Street Hopper ... more Photo Hopper Stone Associated Press Al Pacino finds his old guy groove in Danny Collins 1 / 4 Back to Gallery In his recent movies Al Pacino has been devoting himself to showing what its like to be an old guy. He was an old cop in ""Righteous Kill"" an old gangster in ""Standup Guys"" an old actor in ""The Humbling"" and now hes an old rock star in ""Danny Collins."" In each of those roles his age was not incidental but was very much a part of what those movies had to say. With ""Danny Collins"" this movement in Pacinos career gets interesting. Until now the most indelible Pacino has always been the young man. Many actors experience a heyday in their 40s but Pacino had his in his 30s when he made a series of classics including the first two ""Godfather"" movies ""Serpico"" ""Dog Day Afternoon"" and ""...And Justice for All."" Hell never top that but these recent movies may end up creating a new indelible Pacino image as well as an important third act in a great actors career. These new films explore questions that Hollywood usually avoids What is it like to have been somebody in the world but then lose your ability or interest? How do you escape the patterns of a lifetime? How do you conduct yourself when you feel the same as ever but the clock is running down? And what if anything really matters in the end? ""Danny Collins"" is an entertaining and refreshing take on these questions with Pacino as a megastar of more than 40 years standing a pop elder statesman like Bob Dylan or Paul McCartney whom even 20-year-olds would recognize. But unlike Dylan or McCartney Danny hasnt written a song in 30 years; and though he sells out big arenas he cant help but feel like he lost himself along the way. Wherever he goes everybody wants to hear his last big hit ""Hey Baby Doll"" a song that sounds like light pleasing pop the first time you hear it but by the second or third time is revealed as an anvil around his neck. Singing ""Hey Baby Doll"" to 20000 people isnt like breaking rocks for a living but anyone could see how that wouldnt be fulfilling. Then one day his longtime agent (Christopher Plummer) gives him an unexpected present. Apparently back in 1971 John Lennon wrote a letter to Danny warning him about the dangers of fame and inviting him to hang out with him. The letter was never delivered and now more then 40 years later Danny seizes on this missive as the summons to change his life. Maybe if hed met Lennon he wouldnt have dried up as an artist or turned into a nostalgia act. ""Danny Collins"" is a fun glimpse into stardom on the ultimate level. Every person he meets feels privileged just to talk to him. He is greeted only by smiles; and in return he has to perform and act high spirited even if he doesnt feel that way. For sure it enhances the movie that Danny is being played by Pacino a star of equal magnitude and at times we cant help but wonder where the character ends and Pacino begins. As you might expect the movie is about one mans attempts at redemption both as an artist and as a human being but theres a nice fluidity and freedom to writer-director Dan Fogelmans storytelling so things never become predictable. Bobby Cannavale has a supporting role as Dannys son who is bitter at never having known his father though at least he should be happy that he got his height from moms side of the family. Cannavale has too often been cast in thuggish roles. Here he retains some thuggish power but hes basically a sensitive family man. As the woman who becomes Dannys conscience -- a hotel manager that he keeps flirting with -- Annette Bening is warm but wary projecting the self-protective aura of someone who knows she is out of her depth. Its a subtle performance suggesting lots of thought and suppressed emotion. By the way ""Danny Collins"" is inspired by the true story of Steve Tilston a British musician who received a 1971 letter from John Lennon some 30 years after it was written. The gist of the letter was about the same but all the characters and circumstances are creations of the filmmaker. Curiously that makes ""Danny Collins"" one of two movies currently in release -- the other is ""Living Is Easy With Eyes"" closed -- based on something John Lennon did in real life. In both cases Lennon extended himself in a generous way that took him no more than 10 minutes and he probably never thought of it again. But over 40 years later it all comes back.

He was so so great in the first couple of ""Godfather"" movies ""Serpico"" and ""Dog Day Afternoon"" among so many other films and then settled into an overacting mode that garnered him an Oscar in ""Scent of a Woman"" for basically saying ""Hoo-ah"" every so often; this was clearly a career-achievement award.In ""Danny Collins"" the directing debut of screenwriter Dan Fogelman Pacino and his director dont get back to basics -- given that Pacino plays the title character an aging rock star who long ago sold out that wouldnt make sense. But the actor brings such a charming attitude to the role that his performance feels far more genuine than the story itself.Despite the fact that as the opening credits tell us ""The following is based on a kind of true story a little bit.""As the film opens Collins is a kid in 1971 doing an interview being told by the reporter that his talents rival the likes of John Lennon. Why does he seem so afraid of becoming rich and famous?Because he is Collins replies.Years later Collins is a Neil Diamond-esque singer. He squeezes himself into a girdle snorts a few lines of cocaine and belts out his signature hit ""Hey Baby Doll"" for adoring aging boomers. Hes rich with a mansion and a (very) young fiance (this is to be his fourth marriage) and a hollowed-out soul. Hes unfulfilled. He and his longtime manager Frank (Christopher Plummer) know it but its hard to shut down such a profitable money machine.Then Frank gives Danny a birthday present a long-lost letter Lennon wrote to Collins all those years ago telling him that fame and fortune need not compromise his art. (This part really happened to a British folk singer named Steve Tilston who never found great fame and fortune but has released 20 albums over 40 years.)So Danny dumps his fiance after walking in on her and her lover and heads to New Jersey holing up in a hotel room whose space is taken up by the Steinway he has trucked in. Hes going to write songs again but hes also going to take care of family business.This means a visit to his bitter long-estranged son Tom (Bobby Cannavale) whos married to Samantha (Jennifer Garner). They have a daughter Hope (Giselle Eisenberg). Tom tosses Danny out as soon as he sees him but Hope has ADHD and Danny can pull strings to get her into an exclusive Manhattan school that specializes in teaching kids like Hope.Meanwhile back at the hotel Danny makes comically inept passes at Mary (Annette Bening) the hotel manager who repeatedly turns down his invitation to dinner.You can guess where things are leading but only to a point. Fogelman tosses in some mild surprises along the way some more effective than others.But this is still a movie where yes the adorable child who may help bring people together is named ahem Hope. And in case such clues werent explicit enough Fogelman telegraphs things by sweetening the soundtrack with obvious Lennon solo selections including ""Working Class Hero."" So although some details may seem like twists every emotional note this kind of movie hits is reliably dealt with here.Fogelmans writing credits include the animated films ""Bolt"" and ""Tangled"" which were good as well as such live-action movies as ""Crazy Stupid Love"" which also was good and ""Last Vegas"" which was terrible.Yet the latter film leads to this one at least in spirit aging Boomers seeing a glamorized form of wish-fulfillment will love it. The difference here is Pacinos performance so theres a chance people in other age groups might too.Danny Collins3 stars (out of 5) Director Dan Fogelman.Cast Al Pacino Christopher Plummer Annette Bening.Rating R for language drug use and some nudity.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

(Bleecker Street) By Stephanie Merry March 26 2015 Follow stephmerry Channeling equal parts Tom Jones and Barry Manilow Al Pacino delivers an impressive performance as the title character in ""Danny Collins"" a sweet but shallow movie about a rock star who hasnt written a song in decades but can still sell out a stadium. The crowds come to hear him croon his old hits especially the cheesy singalong-inducing ""Hey Baby Doll"" which sounds very much like something Neil Diamond would have churned out around 1970. Ultra-tan with longish hair a pristine set of teeth and his shirt open one button too far Danny looks the part of the aging rocker. And with his 20- something blonde fiancee and a cross pendant full of cocaine he acts it too. But everything shifts when Danny is given a letter he was supposed to receive in 1971 from none other than John Lennon and Yoko Ono. The pair urged the young musician to value art over fame. They didnt want him to become well exactly what he has become -- an old guy phoning it in just to make the big bucks. So begins the soul-searching. The coke gets flushed down the toilet the fiancee gets pushed aside and Danny heads off to suburban New Jersey where he plans to hang out in a hotel write new music and maybe even begin a relationship with the adult son hes never bothered to meet. In other words its redemption time. Pacino has been taking roles in smaller movies lately and hes made some interesting choices. This is a good fit for him and he has no trouble pulling off the drunken flirtatious and slightly eccentric spotlight seeker. Danny is an entertainer who aims to please the masses even if its at the expense of those closest to him and Pacino exudes enough charm to make the character forgivable. The supporting players deliver memorable performances too. Bobby Cannavale is weary and conflicted as Dannys estranged son while Jennifer Garner playing the sons wife gives the movie a powerful jolt of emotion. And Annette Bening seems to be having fun playing a hotel manager Danny is trying to woo. The two have plenty of chemistry with their steady stream of quick patter. ""Danny Collins"" is the directorial debut of Dan Fogelman the writer behind ""Crazy Stupid Love"" the television musical ""Galavant"" and the retirees-take-Sin-City comedy ""Last Vegas."" Like his other work this redemption narrative feels entirely good-natured and also manufactured to maximize likability. Every emotional moment has its comedic counterpoint keeping the movie light easy and utterly low-stakes. A film with so much drug use nudity and profanity has rarely felt this tame. After all whats the worst that could happen? Danny goes back to snorting coke and selling out shows. Fogelman makes some rookie mistakes the most egregious of which is using far too many montages. Montages can serve as important shorthand in a narrative or emotional arc but nearly all of these could have been replaced with individual scenes to create a similar payoff. If the movie distracts by trying too hard it redeems itself in the final moments with a scene between Pacino and Cannavale that could have been melodramatic but turns out to be profoundly touching. ""Danny Collins"" like its central character has a good heart and sometimes thats enough. R. At area theaters.

"Danny Collins review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review Danny Collins Danny Collins Bleecker Street Annette Benning and Al Pacino in ""Danny Collins."" Annette Benning and Al Pacino in ""Danny Collins."" (Bleecker Street) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Al Pacino rocks out jerk tears and steals Annette Benings heart in Dan Fogelmans debut feature. On screen looking like Keith Richards bright-eyed bushy-tailed life coach and partner in debauchery Al Pacino is a man whose aura screams ""I love the 70s"" Meaning his own. Turning 75 next month Pacino has a high old time in the slight moderately charming ""Danny Collins"" and he bounces off plenty of good and great co-stars among them Annette Bening (as the New Jersey hotel manager hes hot for) and Bobby Cannavale calmly effective as the estranged son of the aging rock star of the title.Snorting cocaine shacked up in luxury with a cheating girlfriend half his age Pacinos Danny Collins is a man desperately in need of a reckoning a personal Waterloo or you know some sort of ... plot device. Inspired by the little-known true story of British folk artist Steve Tilston and a letter he once received from John Lennon writer-director Dan Fogelman concocts a fable in which Danny comes into a possession of an undelivered fan letter Lennon wrote him decades earlier. This is the sign for Danny to seize the days he has left to reconnect with his distant son (Cannavale) the sons valiant wife (Jennifer Garner) and their lovely hyperactive daughter (Giselle Eisenberg) who surely would benefit from an expensive private school education if only she had a grandfather she never knew she had to pay for it. Christopher Plummer wearing the sort of hipster hat the forthcoming Noah Baumbach film ""While Were Young"" makes fun of provides advice counsel and exquisite timing as Dannys longtime manager. Near his sons house in suburban New Jersey Danny holes up in the local Hilton run by Benings sensible yet radiant Mary. Its a push-pull relationship with Mary initially fending off the wolf-in-rock-gods clothing. Danny must prove himself worthy of her and of everyone confined too long to the outskirts of his life.Fogelman wrote ""Crazy. Stupid Love."" whose punctuation I can never forgive. That films warring strains of glibness feeling wit and hollowness return in ""Danny Collins"" as well. Theres a delayed-secret hitch in the narrative that hijacks the movie for better or worse. You dont have to believe any of it to enjoy a lot of it however. Fogelman asks very little of his protagonist other than for him to learn how to be less of a self-centered jerk. The actors skate through it all with aplomb. Among them as a star-struck young hotel desk clerk is ""Whiplash"" alum Melissa Benoist who has a warming smile thats a perfect generational bookend to Benings.

By Peter Rainer Film critic March 20 2015 Save for later Saved Al Pacino takes on another washed-up-guy-mounts-comeback role (world of music this time) in Danny Collins. Hopper Stone/Courtesy of Bleeker Street          View Caption About video ads View Caption of In ""The Humbling"" Al Pacino recently played an aging actor who had lost faith in his acting. In ""Danny Collins"" hes playing an aging rock star who long ago lost his muse. Whats next for Pacino - an aging novelist who can no longer face a blank page?Critically if not commercially ""The Humbling"" was a triumph for Pacino - his best work in years. As the renowned dissolute stage actor Simon Axler he poured all his protean energy into the part but dropped his usual flamboyance. His force field was inner-directed this time.As Danny Collins hes working with far less resonant material. Pacino is not unbelievable as a Neil Diamond-ish rock star. Shimmying in front of a packed amphitheater of graying fans he gets to sing an oldie Collins hit called ""Hey Baby Doll"" and his pipes are OK. Its just that as written and directed by Dan Fogelman the role (until the moving final scene) never allows Pacino much opportunity to cut below the surface. Danny is a theatrical conceit rather than a full-fledged character. Recommended The 50 best movies of all time This is unfortunate because the films central premise is promising. The boozy womanizing Danny is about to launch a national tour when a fan letter from John Lennon written to Danny in 1971 when he was just finding his own way as a promising singer-songwriter is presented to him by his longtime manager (Christopher Plummer). The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide Danny had never received this newly discovered letter which included Lennons home phone number. Would Dannys career - his entire life - have been radically altered if he had met up with Lennon? (Something like this actually happened to a British musician named Steve Tilston in 2005 which became the jumping off point for this film.)Instead of exploring this outcome Fogelman veers into standard weepy-comic terrain. Danny who spends his money as fast as he makes it checks into a Hilton hotel in rural New Jersey buys a fancy red Mercedes instead of renting a car and proceeds to seek out the son he never knew. The son (Bobby Cannavale) of course bitter at Dannys abandonment of his mother wants nothing to do with Danny even though he (a) hasnt a great deal of dough (b) has a hyperactive daughter with special-education needs and (c) has a life-threatening illness. I almost forgot His wife (Jennifer Garner) is pregnant.So the stage is set for a redemption drama-comedy with Danny doing his wheedly best to get into his sons good graces. Money cant buy love but then again it can sort of - at least if you can pay for a full private school tuition complete with chauffeur etc. Meanwhile what becomes of the Lennon letter and its repercussions? Not much. Danny installs a grand piano in his ordinary-sized hotel room and tinkers a bit on a new ""personal"" song that is not remotely as grabby as ""Hey Baby Doll."" (He hasnt composed a new song in 30 years.) He dogs the unimpressed hotel manager (Annette Bening) until she finally breaks down and goes on a dinner date with him. Naturally she sees the good in Danny and encourages his songwriting.When he finally attempts to unveil the ""new"" Danny at a local club packed with aging fans the predictable ensues. At this point the film loses its way entirely. Are we supposed to think that Danny is actually better off playing his oldies for oldsters or are we meant to believe he didnt have the gumption to reinvent himself as the artist he might have been? Its difficult to know how to take all this since Dannys personal song at least to my ears sounds pretty blah. At least ""Hey Baby Doll"" maddening as it is has a bouncy hook. The movie becomes perhaps inadvertently a celebration of selling out. Grade C+ (Rated R for language drug use and some nudity.)

Should he a) rein it in and strive for the quiet intensity of his early screen appearances in the 1970s or b) double down and go full-tilt-boogie? Pacino to his credit has opted for c) all of the above. Hes definitely traveling the fascinatingly-subdued route in David Gordon Greens ""Manglehorn"" (which just made its US debut at SXSW) and ""Danny Collins"" gives the actor a role that allows him to be the life of the party while also giving him plenty of two-hander scenes that let him interact with a talented ensemble on a very human level. The movie itself is fairly schmaltzy (although admittedly not nearly as squicky as a plot synopsis might suggest) but as a showcase for what Pacino has still got in his paintbox in his mid-70s ""Danny Collins"" like ""Manglehorn"" reminds us that theres more to this guy than ""Hoo-HAH"" Also Read Al Pacinos Indie Movie Manglehorn Bought by IFC Films We first meet singer-songwriter Danny (or rather the back of his head) in 1971 when he admits to a rock journalist (played by Nick Offerman) that he finds the prospect of imminent fame and fortune more terrifying than gratifying. As we jump ahead 45 or so years we see that Danny (Pacino) was right to be worried Decades after his initial critical success Danny Collins is a boozy coked-up joke singing the same dopey hits to arenas full of aging fans. Dannys got the mansion the inappropriately young fiancee the gull-wing Mercedes and the ""Greatest Hits Volume 3"" but he finds satisfaction in none of this. Its no wonder hes so rocked by a birthday present from his best friend and manager Frank (Christopher Plummer) Its a letter to Danny from John Lennon -- sent to that journalist who kept it all these years -- telling him that you can get rich and still remain an artist and inviting Danny to give him a call sometime so they could talk about music. Danny sets off to New Jersey setting up camp in a Hilton -- and immediately flirting with the hotel manager Mary (Annette Bening) -- with two goals write a song that isnt crap and build a relationship with his long-estranged son Tom (Bobby Cannavale) a construction worker who wants nothing to do with this flashy stranger. Also Read TheWrap Screening Series Al Pacino Identifies With an Actor on the Way Out in The Humbling (Video) Writer-director Dan Fogelman (""Crazy. Stupid. Love."") working from what the opening card admits is at best a kinda-sorta true story seems as torn as Danny is between his artistic impulses and his hard-wired attraction to bland audience-friendly material. On the one hand the story goes pretty much exactly where you think it will but at the same time ""Danny Collins"" generates its funniest and most dramatic moments precisely when the characters behave more like human beings and less like moving parts of whats clearly intended to be a feel-good hit. The movie has an anonymous corporate sheen to it -- cinematographer Steve Yedlin (""Looper"") might as well be shooting that Hiltons welcome video -- but it merits a look for Pacinos interactions with his co-stars. Hes not all that convincing standing in front of a rock band but his individual moments with Plummer with Bening with Cannavale and with Jennifer Garner (as Toms wife Samantha) feel genuine whether theyre touching or amusing. (Pacinos banter with Bening would be even better if Fogelmans script didnt force them to acknowledge every so often that they are indeed bantering.) Also Read HBO Suspends Pre-Production of Brian De Palmas Penn State Molestation Film To Deal With Budget Issues Fogelman does deserve credit for working with his actors including young Giselle Eisenberg as Tom and Samanthas daughter Hope; she offers one of the screens more convincing portrayals of a kid with ADHD without overdoing it. (I just wish Fogelman didnt try to get so much symbolic mileage out of her name.) ""Danny Collins"" and its eponymous hero have two things in common they really really really want you to like them and theyre at their most lovable in those too-rare moments that they cut the crap and get real for a second.

Bleecker Street hide caption toggle caption Bleecker Street Singer Danny Collins (Al Pacino) with his manager Frank Grubman (Christopher Plummer). Bleecker Street Al Pacino as a jaded aging rocker re-juiced by a road trip to settle accounts with himself and his long-lost family? By all means roll your eyes -- the star has one brow goofily raised himself -- but dont give up on Danny Collins. In a (slightly) lower key than hes wont to play Pacino puts a sweet spin on Danny that makes him more worth attending to than you might expect from the drifting geezer we meet decked out in regulation gold chains and a bleary cocaine haze. He may be a trite spectacle but if Annette Bening with all her grown-up allure on tap thinks hes worth a second look shouldnt we too? Directed by Dan Fogelman (Crazy Stupid Love) the movie coyly announces that it was inspired by a true story ""a little bit."" That true story Well into his career the folk songwriter Steve Tilston received a letter written to him decades earlier by John Lennon who urged him to follow his heart whether he hit the big time or remained a starving artist. Fogelman raids that late delivery for the films conceit the Beatles letter finds Danny trapped in a velvet prison of his own success. Unable for 30 years to write new material he tours the country cranking out a hoary old tune (Hey Baby Doll) his boomer female fans still cant get enough of. As his loyal roadie (Christopher Plummer) warns hes burned a deep hole in his savings on drugs and a ""fiancee"" less than half his age. The youth of today also adores him which seems unlikely but never mind. Inspired by Lennons advice Danny takes off alone in his massive tour bus and parks himself in a middling New Jersey hotel in hopes of reaching out to the son he conceived on a one-night stand. As you might expect Tom (Bobby Cannavale) is still marinating in anger toward his absent father despite having scored a steady job a loving wife (Jennifer Garner) and a motor-mouthed little girl with special needs. As a family drama equipped with all the usual plot triggers -- isnt it time for a 10-year moratorium on the cancer subplot? -- Danny Collins is no more than adequate. Adversity scales down the big star into an ordinary guy struggling to step up for the common hurts and losses we all face. What makes a difference is that Dannys a spent man in search of a third act. So perhaps is Pacino who plays this lost soul with a lightly suppressed joy offering him to us as a man who fully accepts that he cuts a ridiculous figure yet persists in making himself useful whether or not his help is appreciated. In the end Danny Collins works best as a romantic comedy written by Fogelman with cheeky irreverence and delivered with offhanded charm by two seasoned actors who clearly relish their improbable chemistry. Along the winding road from her shimmering glamour in 1991s Bugsy to her lesbian helicopter parent with a robust yen for gay male porn in The Kids Are All Right (2011) Bening has worked up a signature wry amused intelligence that expands to fit almost any role. Benings Mary is a hotel manager who dresses in sensible cardies and a neat helmet of hair. Shes a practical soul a bit disappointed by life but game to go another round. She steadfastly turns down Dannys overtures but theres a frisky playmate in Mary whos itching to be drawn out by a man she believes will surprise her. Mary is not playing hard to get. She is hard to get because she has her own battle scars and because she knows that Danny will be no good to her until he gets a life worth living. As for Danny he sees right off the bat that with Mary hes playing way out of his league -- and blunders ahead anyway. Thats the whole cheerful fun of it. Correction March 20 2015 In an earlier version of this story Steve Tilstons name was misspelled as Tilson. Additionally the photo credit incorrectly spelled Bleecker as Bleeker.

VPCAl Pacino stars as an aging rocker in ""Danny Collins.""(Photo Hopper Stone AP) 76 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORETheres something endearing about a movie that opens with a candid disclaimer.Danny Collins ( 1/2 out of four; rated R; opening Friday in select cities) introduces itself with ""The following is based on a true story a little bit.""Its 1971 and singer/songwriter Danny Collins (Eric Michael Roy) has made a remarkable first album. In an interview hes asked who has inspired him. John Lennon he says. When the journalist (Nick Offerman) predicts hell become a big star the sensitive young musician looks terrified.Cut to 40 years later. Collins (Al Pacino) has indeed attained stardom. His music consists of catchy throwaway pop ditties that mature audiences love to sing along with. After that first album his creativity all but dried up. He went on to record other peoples songs gave zealous performances and got rich.At times his song style and overall mien have a Neil Diamond vibe though hes meant as more of a vapid rock star. Mostly hes the caricature of a sellout. Before a concert he sprays on a tan corsets his paunch snorts a line of cocaine dons gold chains and a fake smile and sprints onto the stage. His signature moves are outsized and corny as are his tunes.Yet he loathes himself more than we possibly could.His manager Frank (Christopher Plummer) gives Collins a present that sets the story in motion.Its a letter to Collins from Lennon written four decades earlier. Sent to the journalist who wrote that initial profile it ended up in the hands of a collector.Lennons letter encourages the singer to stay true to himself and offers his phone number should he want to talk. Collins pushing 70 wonders how his career might have been different if he had connected with Lennon.Like an uneven album the movie has some harmonious authentically lilting moments and other off-putting ones.Pacino can be charmingly self-deprecating and sardonically funny until he begins mugging and raising his voice histrionically. A few photos of the young Pacino (superimposed on album covers) remind what a subtle actor he used to be. Its oddly fascinating how he evolved into someone who can be so over the top.But this is one of his better roles in years bolstered by chemistry with a great cast of supporting players. Perhaps the part of a big star who finds himself going through the motions later in life resonates with him.Pacino and Plummer have an easy rapport with impeccable comic timing as they discuss Collins choices in women (age-inappropriate) and his yearning to rekindle his creative mojo. Also delightful is Pacinos connection with Mary (Annette Bening) a down-to-earth hotel manager at the suburban New Jersey Hilton he moves into. Its a pleasure to watch a pair of pros tentatively flirt in a one-step-forward two-steps-back fashion.He also has some terrific moments with Tom (Bobby Cannavale) the son he never knew and daughter-in-law Samantha (Jennifer Garner).Inspired by the story of singer Steve Tilston -- who received a letter from Lennon in 2005 25 years after the former Beatle was murdered outside his New York apartment -- its mostly the invention of writer/director Dan Fogelman whose dialogue is often spot-on. The film is beautifully punctuated by Lennons best post-Beatles songs.The story looks as if its headed for a cloyingly life-affirming resolution then unexpectedly hits the brakes. Though occasionally contrived in its more low-key honest moments Danny Collins rings out with emotional resonance. 76 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1MNPD9Y",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/03/19/danny-collins-review/25006541/,200,dannycollins22,dannycollins,usatoday

Comments Danny Collins Video Rated R  106 minutes  2015 In 1971 John Lennon read an interview with up-and-coming English folksinger Steve Tilston in which Tilston worried that success would inhibit him creatively; the former Beatle dashed off a letter to Tilston protesting that this wasnt so but Tilston never saw the letter until 2005. I can imagine a lot of good movies developing from this premise but as fictionalized by screenwriter Dan Fogelman (Last Vegas) it becomes yet another soggy tale of father-son healing with a disllusioned boomer rock star (Al Pacino) trying to reconnect with his estranged biological child (Bobby Cannavale). Lennon solo tunes decorate the soundtrack though the climactic cameo appearance by Yoko Ono that I thought was inevitable never materializes. Fogelman directed; with Jennifer Garner Christopher Plummer and Annette Bening the movies sole bright spot as a prim hotel manager gently fending off the amorous scarf-laden rocker. By J.R.

( Hopper Stone SMPSP) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday March 19 2015 1200 PM Title Danny Collins Film Info With Al Pacino Bobby Cannavale. A glitzy musician decides to change his life. Director Dan Fogelman (146) R Language sexuality. Angelika Lincoln Square. Leave it to Al Pacino to find the good in the mediocre. Of all the stars of the 70s Pacino remains the only one who brings wonderful small moments to his roles even as he intersperses them with the required Big Star bombast. Thats what makes Pacinos latest film the otherwise formulaic ""Danny Collins"" so enjoyable. This uneven but ultimately sweet comedy-drama takes full advantage of Pacinos larger-than-life persona (think ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" ""Donnie Brasco"" ""The Insider"") and his ability to add in lovely grace notes. Bobby Cannavale and Jennifer Garner in ""Danny Collins"" (SMPSP/Hopper Stone ) Pacino plays the title character an aging Neil Diamond-like music star who abandoned his heartfelt songs of the early 70s to become a gaudy stadium-filling showboater. Danny gives the audience what it wants even if his sellout along with the drugs drink and women is slowly killing him. Then Danny discovers a lost letter that John Lennon sent him in 1971 in which the Beatle tells him to stay true to himself. When he reads the advice from which his younger self could have benefited Danny takes stock and heads to New Jersey to find the grown son Tom (Bobby Cannavale) hes never met. Annette Bening and Al Pacino in ""Danny Collins"" directed by Dan Fogelman. (SMPSP/Hopper Stone ) That relationship strikes the movies best chords mainly because of Cannavales inability to give anything but honest grounded performances. Tom is a blue-collar guy who resents the superstar his mom a former groupie once slept with. But hes got other issues including a pregnant wife (Jennifer Garner) and a daughter with ADHD. The films fairy-tale arc is as familiar as an old song but its all in the playing. Writer-director Dan Fogelman gives Danny sparky characters to bounce off of and got charmers to play them Christopher Plummer is Dannys rascally manager; Annette Bening is frisky and fun as the hotel manager Danny flirts with; and Melissa Benoist is a cute receptionist Danny tries to hook up with an earnest parking attendant. Cannavale and Pacinos energies are so different it gives their scenes a tension the sometimes saccharine story needs. But Pacino knows this guy hes playing and how to make ""Danny Collins"" better than it seems Rasp out the familiar hooks but work the stuff thats between the lines.

Photo by Hopper Stone (c) 2014 Bleecker Street A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Some years ago I went to see Tom Jones perform. He sang all the hits but I was unnerved by his new walnut-brown goatee. It looked freshly trimmed and fake as if hed ripped it off Evil Spock backstage. Superstars arent allowed to change. Even the fans who love them insist they be dipped in wax no new songs no new attitude and certainly no new look.Such is the ""kind of based on a true story a little bit"" premise of Danny Collins a winning charmer starring Al Pacino as a megawatt singer who sells out stadiums packed with silver bouffants and has calcified into a caricature of a human being. Pacino plays him as delusionally vain. He wears his shirts unbuttoned to just above his girdle and is so coated in bronzer that he looks like a maple donut. Only his droll manager Frank (Christopher Plummer) whos even older gets away with calling him ""kid"" and also ""Sylvia Plath."" When Danny gets wasted on scotch and groans about his life Frank corrects him ""Pregnant women in Africa feeding half their village with their titties have problems.""Film DetailsCritics Pick Danny Collins RatingR GenreComedy Running Time106 min. More Info Trailer Writer-director Dan Fogelman (making his filmmaking debut after penning Crazy Stupid Love. and Tangled) is sympathetic to a point. All creative types understand the fear that their best work is behind them and worse that there are leftover ideas they cant figure out how to say assuming audiences were even willing to hear them. Still Dannys agonies are at least half-funny. Sure hes gotten older -- but all the bikini babes at his birthday party have stayed the same age. (And Fogelman cant resist panning down a row of gray-haired men gazing wistfully at the pool.)Danny wants to go back to the folk singer he was in 1971 whom we meet in a brief flashback. A reporter (Nick Offerman) warns that hes so talented ""like fucking Lennon man"" that hes destined for fame fortune and females. Young Danny (Davide Donatello a dead ringer for Pacino in Dog Day Afternoon) looks so scared you half expect him to bolt from the office and go rob a bank. In a way he did After sales of a personal album flopped he gave up and swaggered through other peoples songs earning enough easy loot for a mansion complete with lithe blond fiancee (his fourth) and its own elevator. Hes accepted selling out -- who wouldnt? -- until Frank presents him with a lost letter Lennon wrote four and a half decades ago urging Danny to ""stay true to yourself."" Talk about a from-the-grave guilt trip. Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat. Sep. 10 1200pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On the CW Tickets Sat. Sep. 10 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On CBS Tickets Mon. Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm Danny Collins is a redemption movie in the skeptical key of Jerry Maguire. Our decadent hero decides to fix himself in the first act. The rest of the film is him realizing how hard it will be to keep living right -- and that maybe he doesnt have the moral clout to manage it. Here Danny jets off to New Jersey in his private plane checks into a modest hotel hosting a dental convention and stuffs a grand piano into a room so cramped he has no choice but to sit down at the stool and compose.In a way Danny Collins is allowing Al Pacino to do the same thing. The great 70s talent has ""hoo-ah""-ed through recent decades cranking out variations on his greatest hits. This movie is a narrow character piece that shows Pacino wrestling to reveal layers in a man whos worried he might actually be hollow. He and Fogelman string together dozens of small perfect moments the way Danny deflects gawkers with aggressive extroversion a bit where he lobs lemon rinds into a tequila glass with drunken dead aim his confident shrug when the hotel manager Mary (Annette Bening) tells him his silken scarf looks ridiculous.He and Mary are fated to flirt -- we know it the second Bening pops up behind a desk blinking in confusion. But Fogelman bases their connection not on Dannys need to heal himself with a normal mortal but on Danny and Marys repartee. They click and their dialogue feels sprightly not scripted. (As a bonus when Danny compliments himself that 18-years-younger Mary is age-appropriate Frank clucks ""No not really."")Danny has a harder time wooing his estranged son Tom (Bobby Cannavale) the result of a one-night stand with a groupie. Tom a construction worker has his own family with wife Samantha (Jennifer Garner) and wild moppet Hope (Giselle Eisenberg a hyperactive powerhouse) and no tolerance for this fancy-pants stranger who unmans him by offering to pay for his granddaughters expensive dream school. Cannavale is perfect in the part Hes got the brawn of a working-class hero but his eyebrows are always tilted as if hes about to cry. He comes close to out-acting Pacino who proves willing to share the mic.Everyone gets over-invested in Dannys could-be comeback but they and the film know how to cut the sweetness with just enough sour. When Mary beams that despite barely knowing Danny and even if it sounds weird to say shes proud of him he cracks ""That is fucking weird."" Yet even if Mary thinks she knows whats best for him Fogelman doesnt discount the power of Dannys staying exactly the same. After all singing the hits makes millions happy -- and maybe that does matter more than the soul of one man.DANNY COLLINS | Written and directed by Dan Fogelman | Bleecker Street | Landmark Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Danny Collins title character is a pop crooner pushing 70 who floats along trailed by a colorful scarf and a mist of booze and cocaine. Never mind that Al Pacino who plays Danny couldnt carry a tune if his life depended on it. What he captures is the essence of the aging celebrity whos always on. He treats every person as though they were an audience and he were expected to keep them entertained. This is the kind of thing that should come effortlessly to Pacino one of the all-time greats of American acting but no longer does. In fact this qualifies as his best and most easygoing film performance in a good decade.At first glance Danny Collins seems like one of those classic boomer fantasies of reinvention and reconciliation the kind where old guys learn how to make up for lost time. Danny--still selling out 5000-seat theaters and greatest-hits shows--gets a ""What do you get the man who has everything?"" present from his manager (Christopher Plummer) for his birthday a personal letter from John Lennon sent in 1970 but never delivered. Gazing out across his mansion--effectively at the past 45 years of his life--Danny decides to start over. He boards his private jet flies out to New Jersey and checks into a suburban Hilton; quits drugs; has a grand piano hauled into his hotel room to work on his first original song in 30 years; flirts ceaselessly with the Hilton manager (Annette Bening); and shows up unannounced at the doorstep of the grown son (Bobby Cannavale) he fathered with a groupie decades ago and abandoned. Throughout Danny never stops asking peoples names and cracking jokes; hes a showman and this show is for him. He acts like a multi-millionaire fairy godmother giving away luxury cars trying to set strangers up on dates and driving around in a tour bus with his own smirking face printed on the side. Which is to say that Danny is the embodiment of a certain fantasy not just of being able to turn around your own life but to gift improvement and fix others lives. The unique thing about Danny Collins--a light unexceptional-looking comic drama thats carried in large part by its cast--is how it sets up this conventional sentimental resolution but then refuses it. The directorial debut of Dan Fogelman writer of Crazy Stupid Love and Last Vegas the movie combines the compulsive sub-plotting of the former with the retirement-age asides of the latter. (Eighty-five-year-old Plummers wardrobe--tight black T-shirt slim-fit jeans crushed-velvet blazer and a trilby he never takes off--almost qualifies as a joke in and of itself.) But it then takes those elements in an uncharacteristically realistic direction. This is the story of an aging pop star trying to get sober find creative fulfillment start a new romance become the father and grandfather he never was and--in a twist that feels mawkish until it doesnt--help someone confront a possibly terminal illness; the unusual thing is that it recognizes that its not-quite-hero cant do most or maybe even any of these things. It begins as pure fantasy and gradually grounds itself ending on a graceful note thats almost completely unexpected.

Al Pacino has never been any good at comedy and sentimentality is not his forte. Attempting both in Danny Collins hes so far away from his comfort zone that it comes as a shock to confess that I find it his best work in years--good enough to sweeten the bile left by his last 10 flops most recently the disastrous The Humbling. (An old ham actor ready for suicide falls in love with a young lesbian? I dont think so and neither did anyone else.) A first feature directed by Dan Fogelman who wrote Crazy Stupid Love (fresh) and the Barbra Streisand vehicle The Guilt Trip (despicable) Danny Collins is nothing to write home about but it kept me entertained without too much guilt and I didnt wince. By todays American movie standards thats becoming very high praise indeed. DANNY COLLINS  (2/4 stars) Written and directed by Dan Fogelman Starring Melissa Benoist Al Pacino and Jennifer Garner Running time 106 min. Danny Collins (Pacino) is a has-been rock star from the Nixon years that once had promise. He hasnt written anything important in decades but some of his catchy schlock is still cherished by his fans now an audience of finger-popping weaving waving senior citizens. Danny hates his hit tunes the way Lesley Gore hated ""Its My Party"" and Rosemary Clooney hated ""Cmon-a My House"" but hes too lazy to write anything new so he still gives the public what it wants. Hes made millions; he lives in a house begging for an Architectural Digest cover replete with zebra rugs a glass elevator polished wood floors enough blonde bimbos to guarantee the beds never get cold and enough coke to prove hes financially solvent. But Danny is miserable. He once made an album of innovative pop tunes nobody bought so he gave up and stuck to unoriginal songs made famous by other chartbusters. Now in his 70s the feeling hes a fraud comes full circle with the sudden discovery of a rock-and-roll artifact in the form of a fan letter from his idol the late John Lennon who heard his album and was very impressed. Written in 1971 the letter was sold to a collector and is now presented to Danny as a framed birthday present from the past. Its a gag gift but the fact that it predicts a creative and profitable career for an artist who was adored by the most famous member of The Beatles has a profound impact. Overwhelmed Danny decides--against the advice of the long-suffering manager who has raked in his 10 percent since the American Bandstand days (another great three-dimensional performance by Christopher Plummer)--to throw in the towel flush the drugs and turn over a new leaf. The plot is so preposterous its hard to believe it claims to be based on a true story. Your move. The road to redemption begins when Danny cancels his next tour closes up his mansion in Beverly Hills and moves to a suburban Hilton hotel in New Jersey near a modest house that belongs to his estranged son from a one-night stand he hardly remembers. Its not the kind of family reunion Danny dreamed about which you used to see on Oprah. Grown son Tom (a terrific Bobby Cannavale) is a construction worker denied the privilege of education and ignored his entire life by a rich and celebrated father who deserted him as a child. He wont have anything to do with the father he detests. His pregnant wife Samantha (Jennifer Garner) and precocious little daughter Hope (Giselle Eisenberg) are more sympathetic to Grandpa. They inspire Danny to stop singing the same old crappy songs just because they were hits live up to his original potential and rekindle his inert career. To this end he is also helped enormously by the pretty pragmatic manager of the Hilton played with more charm than the role deserves by Annette Bening. Danny even books a gig in a small lounge to show off his new more sophisticated songs--which is ridiculous of course. Think of Bruce Springsteen at the Holiday Inn. When his fans show up on Medicare and demand the old hits Danny caves and gives them what they want reversing all of his progress in one night. But this is the kind of movie that seems sponsored by Hallmark Cards so all is forgiven when Danny starts writing checks to send Hope to an expensive school for special needs kids and save Tom from dying of leukemia. It could only happen in New Jersey. The script eschews the occasional drift toward more meaningful themes to spread joy when it is least credible. Danny has serious problems resulting from guilt shame many broken marriages the neglect of his only relatives and 40 years of self-destruction but none so challenging they cant be solved by a gruff grin or another bear hug. Curiously he is never forced by Mr. Fogelmans screenplay to face his own demons so its up to everybody else to change. Hes a bastard and a deadbeat dad but the movie makes him too lovable to give up on. Mr. Pacino works overtime to achieve that goal. But the rest of the cast seems underused to the detriment of credulity. Die-hard Pacino fans will undoubtedly curdle watching their rough-hewn heros conversion to uneasy charm. But anyone who believes his talent peaked a long time ago might warm to an agreeable side of Mr. Pacino seldom seen--sweet and soft as a frozen custard.

Photo Hopper Stone / Bleecker Street Danny Collins Productions LLC MOVIE REVIEW Danny Collins Running time 108 minutes. Rated R (drugs nudity violence). The idea of Al Pacino as a narcissistic 70s rock star who checks into a suburban New Jersey hotel to bulldoze his way into the life of a grown son who wants nothing to do with our hero has a certain appeal -- especially with Pacino backed up by a blue-chip cast. In this shamelessly corny directing debut by screenwriter Dan Fogelman (""Last Vegas) Pacinos Danny Collins rethinks his hedonistic lifestyle after his long-suffering manager (Christopher Plummer) presents him with a just-found l971 letter from John Lennon urging young Danny to be true to himself and his music. Schlock rocker Danny has gotten wealthy doing neither while ingesting prodigious quantities of drugs. But the letter inspires him to abandon his Beverly Hills mansion his latest young girlfriend and his stash. He hops in his private jet and holes up in the Woodcliff Lake Hilton in Jersey while he writes his first music in decades and tries to make things right with the son who was conceived decades earlier in a one-night stand. Giselle Eisenberg (left) and Jennifer Garner in ""Danny Collins.""Photo Photo courtesy of Hopper Stone / Bleecker Street Danny Collins Productions LLC The son (the ever-reliable Bobby Cannavale) a struggling building contractor gruffly tries to wave away his well-heeled dad. But hes got a cute young daughter (Giselle Eisenberg) with learning disabilities -- and its awfully hard to say no when Pops returns in a tour bus that will take the family (Jennifer Garner plays the wife) for an expedited interview at a special Manhattan school run by you guessed it a Danny Collins fan. This is the sort of movie where a cough signals a life-threatening disease and where the divorced manager of the Hilton (Annette Bening) tells her star guest that his clothes make him look ""ridiculous while turning down his repeated romantic overtures. Will she and the son melt before Dannys relentless charm offensive? Will a gray-haired audience expecting to wave their hands to Dannys 50000th rendition of his signature song respond well to his achingly sincere new piece of music? And will Pacino get his first big cocaine scene since ""Scarface if they dont? ""Danny Collins is certainly watchable but dont go expecting much in the way of surprises.

Granted the title character of Dan Fogelmans press-the-reset-button drama isnt exactly a wallflower After a funny 1971 introduction in which we see a young petrified folksinger getting interviewed for a rock magazine we cut to present day when paunchy Danny Collins (Pacino) is a Neil Diamond-like icon about to release his third greatest-hits collection and still crooning his big sing-along ""Hey Baby Doll"" to an audience of screaming grandmas. The part is perfect for Pacino a performer who despite his genius hasnt been able to shake off a certain dead-eyed exhaustion lately (even when its uncalled for). Danny has a palatial home and a gold-digging girlfriend half his age but hes a zombie at his own surprise birthday party until his devoted longtime manager (Christopher Plummer excellent) gives him a framed letter from John Lennon who unknown to Danny tried to reach out to him in his youthful moment of fear (a real-life story for English songwriter Steve Tilston). Chastened Danny sets out to rediscover his passion in a slightly cutesy plot scored to several late-period Lennon songs--though not curiously ""Starting Over."" For most of its running time Danny Collins settles into a suburban New Jersey Hilton. Nearby theres an estranged grown-up son to reconnect with (Bobby Cannavale stealing the film with his gruff sincerity) not to mention a chirpy desk manager (Annette Bening) who might be an ""age-appropriate"" love interest in our heros de-cynicizing words. You think you know where this is going but its a pleasure to see Fogelman slow down the flow for his two erstwhile Ricky Romas kicking around lifes harsh turns with tenderness.

TWITTER Al Pacino plays an aging rock star in need of an oil change in this sentimental journey. After playing an on-the-skids old actor in The Humbling Al Pacino takes on the role of an aging rock star in need of an oil change in Danny Collins. As amusing as it initially is to see the ever vital actor swanning around as a sort of grizzled cross between Peter Pan and Dorian Gray a boy/man who never really had to grow up screenwriter Dan Fogelmans directorial debut doesnt take long to reveal itself as thoroughly cutesy cornball stuff. The top-notch cast makes this Bleecker Street release almost tolerable but the spectacle of a dissolute hedonist suddenly acquiring a heart and a conscience late in life is shamelessly and shamefully contrived in its emotional trajectory. Fogelmans busy track record as a screenwriter on the likes of Cars 2 Bolt The Guilt Trip Tangled Last Vegas and Crazy Stupid Love bespeaks both glib proficiency and a pronounced urge to please rather than to leave the main road to find what lies beyond. So there may be a nugget of self-regard at the heart of this story about a singer who can still fill the Greek Theater (with crowds of graybeards and ""Golden Girls"") abruptly deciding to chuck a lucrative national tour when a challenge to his complacency presents itself. The trigger for Dannys uncharacteristic leap into the unfamiliar realms of self-assessment and responsibility is perhaps the most interesting detail in the film; its also the only real element in it. Fogelman was jump-started to write the script when he learned of a bizarre happenstance in the life of a songwriter and musician named Steve Tilston who in 2005 came upon a supportive fan letter John Lennon had written to him in 1971 but that he had never received. The handwritten note also included the ex-Beatles phone number with an implicit invitation to call. This belated and haunting discovery prompts the question for both the real and fictional intended recipient What if he had received the letter and called Lennon? What if they had hit it off? Would the younger mans life have been drastically different? Might Tilston have played on ""Mind Games""? Perhaps Danny Collins would have gotten serious and become more like Bruce Springsteen than Neil Diamond upon whom he appears at least partly based. Its not an unpromising jumping-off point for a story of legitimate conjecture and self-exploration. But instead of having Danny throw out the jumpsuits junk the hair dye and get behind the wheel of an old pickup to search for some roads not taken Fogelman puts him in a private jet for a flight to rural New Jersey where he settles into a Hilton to be near the son he doesnt know one who --can you believe it? -- has a little girl another kid on the way and to top it off a life-threatening disease. At his age Danny isnt a likely candidate for reform. He does lay off the drugs and booze but he buys a 100000-plus car rather than renting one and cant stop hitting on every woman around most notably hotel manager Mary Sinclair (Annette Bening) who grins bears it and says no the many times Danny asks her out to dinner. From here the film becomes as cloying and obvious as a bad old-fashioned sitcom. The son Tom (Bobby Cannavale) resents the old man for ignoring him his whole life and rebuffs his offers of financial help. Toms wife (Jennifer Garner) watches her belly get bigger. The granddaughter (Gisele Eisenberg) is adorable for five minutes and annoyingly hyperactive thereafter. And his manager (Christopher Plummer) wants him back on tour. Its just one surprise after another. Having installed a grand piano in his hotel room Danny intermittently faces up to the real challenge posed by the John Lennon letter which is to write some songs of his own for the first time in decades. (Hes primarily identified with an ancient hit called ""Hey Baby Doll."") Can a singer whos taken his superficial charm and modest talent to the bank his whole life suddenly go deep to mine unexplored realms of sensitivity and profundity? Could Britney Spears become Leontyne Price? Could Michael Bay morph into Stanley Kubrick? Although the answer is obvious Danny decides to do a show at a small venue to try out his new material. The meanings to be gleaned from this event could not have been spelled out more literally by a junior high school English teacher so cloyingly obvious and formulaic is everything that Fogelman is getting at here. Still there is a certain pleasure to be taken from Pacinos flamboyant performance which fills and sometimes saturates the screen. Hes the whole show even if everything thats being asked of him here -- the outrageousness the extravagance the blithe acceptance of instant gratification -- remains strictly on the surface. Whatever else might be lurking deep within this man has either been erased by drugs and the easy life or is too banal to merit scrutiny. Nothing extra is asked of or received from the fine actors lined up to support the star turn and production values are ordinary.

With his tufts of gravity-defying shoe-polish hair and burnt-orange tan Al Pacino has been sporting the look of a glammer-than-thou aging rock star for so long now that its only fitting hes finally gotten around to playing one -- which he does exceedingly well in ""Danny Collins."" For his directorial debut screenwriter Dan Fogelman has crafted a familiar late-in-life redemption narrative made surprisingly palatable by Pacinos winning comic bravado a superb supporting cast and currents of real feeling that cut through the expected bromides about the emptiness of fortune and fame. Though its unlikely to score quite the same home run with the Social Security crowd as the Fogelman-scripted ""Last Vegas"" did (134 million worldwide) this March 20 opener should leave the staff of new distributor Bleecker Street humming a happy tune. This is the second time in a year that Pacino has played a celebrated star in the throes of an identity crisis. Only where ""The Humblings"" Simon Axler was a Broadway legend starting to lose his lines (and his grip on reality) Danny Collins is a music-world icon who long ago lost his artistic integrity -- a subject which given the general trajectory of Pacinos movie career over the last decade (from grade-Z action fare like ""Righteous Kill"" and ""88 Minutes"" to the Adam Sandler debacle ""Jack and Jill"") makes this new role seem even closer to home. The Collins we first meet in Fogelmans film -- in a brief ""Almost Famous""-ish prologue set in 1971 -- is an earnest young singer-songwriter in the Bob Dylan/Jim Croce mold (played by Eric Schneider a reasonable doppelganger for the """"Panic in Needle Park""-era Pacino). By the time we jump ahead to the present day hes become a kitsch pop icon with a signature sing-along anthem (""Hey Baby Doll"") a third volume of greatest hits on the charts and a young bimbo fiancee (Katarina Cas) on his arm. In the span of 40-odd years Bob Dylan has become Neil Diamond. Its around this time that Dannys longtime (and long-suffering) manager (the redoubtable Christopher Plummer) gifts him with a most unexpected piece of fan mail a letter from Dannys idol John Lennon penned in 1971 but lost for decades in the hands of a nefarious journalist (arent they all?) and a private collector. The message is a predictable ""stay true to yourself"" encouragement along with an invitation for Danny to phone the ex-Beatle for a private chat. And it is this letter ""Danny Collins"" asks us (not entirely convincingly) to believe that sinks our hero into an existential funk wondering how his life -- and career -- might have fared differently if hed received Lennons letter in a more timely fashion. In fact there was a real Danny Collins or rather a real Steve Tilston a British folk singer who in 2005 received just such a letter written by Lennon in response to an interview the 20-year-old Tilston had given to a now-defunct music magazine in which he worried that commercial success might corrupt his artistry. But as an onscreen text at the start of Fogelmans film states ""Danny Collins"" is only ""kind of based on a true story a little bit"" which means its safe to assume that the real Tilston (whos credited as a consultant here) did not subsequently set off on a cross-country odyssey to meet the adult son (Bobby Cannavale) he fathered with a groupie back in the day or hole himself up in a suburban New Jersey Hilton while trying to get back in touch with his songwriting muse. But ""Danny Collins"" is a movie after all and one that on its own warm fuzzy terms offers a few modest surprises. With his basic setup in place Fogelman could have easily let things coast along on heart-tugging autopilot with all the expected sermonizing about how what really matters in life are the things money cant buy. But Fogelman is smarter than that and so are his characters especially Cannavales Tom and his no-nonsense wife Samantha (Jennifer Garner) who initially resist Dannys dramatic intrusion (complete with football-field-sized tour bus) into their placid suburban lives but soon realize that there are certain advantages to having a rock star in the family -- like jumping to the front of the line for an elite Manhattan school specializing in the needs of children like their ADHD-afflicted daughter Hope (Giselle Eisenberg). Cannavale who can sometimes overdo his Italian-American working-stiff affect is terrific as a man whos spent so much energy trying to become the man his own father never was that its left him at 40 as weary and worn-down as someone twice his age. But even Pacino is dialed way back from the scenery-pulverizing histrionics that have typified his post-""Scent of a Woman"" career. Not unlike Collins himself the actor has veered dangerously close to self-parody on more than one occasion with his outsized gestures and bellowing line readings but he seemed renewed as a performer in his recent collaborations with Barry Levinson (""You Dont Know Jack"" and ""The Humbling"") and in David Gordon Greens ""Manglehorn"" and he does again here especially in the scenes with Cannavale which go beyond the expected ""you were never there for me"" mawkishness. Sometimes the two characters dont say much to each other at all but we know exactly what each of them is feeling. Watching Pacino in this role you can see that he knows what it means to feel soulless and depleted as both an artist and a man and he isnt afraid to share that with an audience. Of course you dont got to a movie like ""Danny Collins"" expecting to see one of those bleak dark-underbelly-of-the-music-biz movies like ""Payday"" or ""Crazy Heart"" or ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" and thats certainly not what Fogelman sets out to deliver. But beneath the sitcom cutesiness and boldfaced sentimentality the film manages to keep just enough reality coursing through to stay grounded. Even then Fogelman doesnt trust his characters (or his audience) quite enough to bypass such creaky contrivances as a potentially fatal illness for one character and for Danny himself a drug-and-alcohol addiction that the movie flicks on and off like a light switch whenever its convenient. And while Fogelman has written some nice tart repartee for Pacino and Annette Bening (as a fastidious hotel manager in whom Danny sees a potentially ""age-appropriate"" love interest) the actress is around just enough to make you wish there were more of her. Fogelman also fouls off whats supposed to be the movies big climax when Danny takes the stage for an intimate cabaret performance at which hes supposed to unveil his first original compositions in years. The way the scene plays out though feels like a lazy narrative cheat especially given a pop landscape in which older artists of all stripes lust after the very sort of back-to-basics career reboot that renders Danny inexplicably paralyzed with fear. A movie with no less a father of musical reinvention than Don Was (producer of lauded ""comeback"" albums for everyone from Bonnie Raitt to yes Neil Diamond) as its in-house music guru ought to have known better. Still Was has co-written (with Ryan Adams) a lovely original ballad ""Dont Look Down"" that serves as Dannys proverbial redemption song -- and unlike most such movie songs sounds like it could have actually been written by the character.  Elsewhere Fogelman cycles through nine of Lennons post-Beatles recordings (including ""Imagine"" which was at one point meant to be this films title) most of them used judiciously and without turning the soundtrack into an overly nostalgic baby-boomer hit parade.

Will says February 15 2016 at 837 am I thought it was great a movie for a rainy day lovely to sit and watch instead of sport. Annette Benning is still gorgeous and Al Pacino is brilliant not his best film by far but definitely not his worst. Reply Miss Vicki says October 2 2015 at 240 am Boring badly written terrible sound (huh. missed a lot of the dialogue) poorly executed badly written disjointed and tiring story. Annette; go home...I would expect much more from you. Al is just being Al...but almost over the hill in a still somewhat sexy exciting amp; quasi=energetic way. But Christopher Plummer OMG thats all I can say about that. ZZZZzzzz mediocrity is the new accepted expectation...its so sad and boring.
