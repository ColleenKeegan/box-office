Shamelessly sappy and emotionally manipulative ""Patch Adams"" is an aggressively heartwarming comedy-drama that may be roasted by critics but embraced by ticketbuyers. Robin Williams pulls out all the stops in a lead role that gives him carte blanche to careen between extremes of silliness and sentimentality; he tries too hard too obviously much like the pic itself. Even so its unwise to underestimate the appeal of a popular star doing crowd-pleasing shtick in slickly packaged Hollywood hokum. Prospects are good for a healthy if not record-breaking theatrical run and an extended shelf-life on video and cable. Williams is cast -- perhaps too perfectly -- as Hunter ""Patch"" Adams a real-life physician who places great stock in the therapeutic value of laughter in his personalized approach to caregiving. Beginning in the early 1970s when he entered medical school and continuing today as he operates an unorthodox clinic in West Virginia Adams often has annoyed the medical establishment by minimizing the boundaries between doctor and patient. In Adams view doctors must be empathic not objective and deal compassionately with human beings rather than simply diagnose diseases. It also helps if you can bring a little standup comedy to your bedside manner. Based on ""Gesundheit Good Health is a Laughing Matter"" the 1993 book Adams wrote with Maureen Mylander ""Patch Adams"" begins in 1969 as the eponymous protagonist checks himself into a mental hospital after attempting suicide. The sensitive young Adams -- played by a conspicuously middle-aged Williams -- is pleasantly surprised to discover he has the ability to heal himself while cheering his fellow patients. More important he recognizes that hes better equipped to provide emotional healing than the hospitals chief psychiatrist. Flash forward two years Patch is a first-year student at Virginia Medical College burning with idealistic desire to ""treat the patient as well as the disease."" His beaming cheeriness immediately upsets his stuffy roommate Mitch (Philip Seymour Hoffman) a physicians son whos deadly serious about good grades and family tradition. Hes also the only character in the entire pic who notices that Patch is a little old to be starting medical school. But his lack of humor makes him an easy target for the audiences scorn. Even so Patch faces an even more formidable nemesis in Dean Walcott (Bob Gunton) a sternly authoritarian taskmaster who has little patience for Patchs touchy-feely sentiments. There is no depth or shading to this overstated and underwritten bad guy. Right from the start he warns his medical students that he will ""rigorously and ruthlessly train the humanity out of you and turn you into something better."" Subtlety is not this pics strong point. Patch is so eager to do good by making merry that he defies the rules that keep first-year students from interacting with patients at the university hospital. With the help of a friendly nurse (Irma P. Hall) he slips into childrens wards to literally clown around for young patients. He also tries to amuse some ailing adults and even manages to win over a surly cancer patient played by Peter Coyote. In one of many scenes that defy credibility while jerking tears Coyotes character banishes his wife and children from his bedside so he can spend his final moments with Patch. Despite repeated attempts by Dean Walcott to have Patch expelled our hero makes great grades and close friends. Better still Patch wins over an initially frosty fellow student Carin (Monica Potter) and convinces her to take part in his program to establish a free clinic where theyll ""use humor to cure pain and suffering."" Mind you its a clinic in a wooded area far outside the city limits raising questions about accessibility that the pic never addresses but everyone has his or her heart in the right place. Everyone that is except Dean Walcott. And more important a troubled patient who triggers a devastating tragedy. The latter setback brings Patch to the very edge of despair. Fortunately his faith in himself (and his methods) is restored just in time thanks to what appears to be nothing less than a sign from God. Its hard to believe that this schmaltzy concoction is the joint effort of director Tom Shadyac and screenwriter Steve Oedekerk who previously teamed for ""The Nutty Professor"" and ""Ace Venture Pet Detective."" For all its basis in fact ""Patch Adams"" seems to exist in a never-never land of movie cliches and simplistic absolutes. Pic makes no effort beyond costuming and production design to root its narrative in the real world of the early 1970s; indeed there are some glaring anachronisms in the dialogue. (""Thats my job."" ""Yeah but you suck at it."") Nobody ever mentions the Vietnam War much less the anti-war movement on the medical school campus. More to the point Patchs anti-establishment attitudes are never linked -- not even by Dean Walcott -- to other student-led rebellions of the day. If the era werent specifically mentioned in onscreen titles many moviegoers might mistake this period story for a contemporary yarn. Although hes undeniably hilarious in many scenes Williams broadly overplays the holy foolishness of his saintly Patch Adams. More than once the audience may agree with a classmate who remarks ""God youre being so self-indulgent"" Among the supporting players Philip Seymour Hoffman is a standout as he struggles mightily -- and to his credit successfully -- to flesh out a tissue-thin character. Monica Potter makes a strong and sympathetic impression as Carin but Bob Gunton is lucklessly stuck in a role of one-note villainy. Composer Marc Shaiman provides a syrupy score that thoughtfully informs the audience exactly what to feel and precisely when to feel it. Other tech credits are adequate.

Starring Robin Williams Monica Potter Daniel London Philip Seymour Hoffman an Bob Gunton. Directed by Tom Shadyac. (PG-13. 110 minutes. At Bay Area Theaters.) ""Patch Adams"" is a perfect vehicle for Robin Williams. He again plays the compassionate manic clown that has been his main character throughout his movie career. And audiences love his wild end runs. Williams has an amazing knack for breathing new life into his persona and ""Patch Adams"" opening today is a fine showcase for his talent. Only Williams could could play the part (although he seems too old to be a medical student). Williams plays the title character in this biographical film loosely based on the life of Arlington Va. physician Hunter ""Patch"" Adams a maverick noted for wearing clown costumes and staging antics to make his patients laugh. As the script points out the real Adams was accused in medical school -- where he raised the hackles of faculty members -- of suffering from ""excessive happiness."" The film drives the point home too many times. But from the first frame Williams owns the role with such goofy passion that even though hes doing shtick he makes the doctor a beacon of extraordinary goodness. Some viewers will want to contact a doctor of Adams ilk. Others will realize how annoying it would be to have a comedian doctor in charge of anything. ""Patch Adams"" also stars Monica Potter (""Con Air"") newcomer Daniel London Philip Seymour Hoffman (""Boogie Nights"") and veteran character actor Bob Gunton (""The Shawshank Redemption""). Tom Shadyac (""Liar Liar"" and ""Ace Ventura Pet Detective"") directed. The film is based on Adams book ""Gesundheit Good Health Is a Laughing Matter."" Pulling in several directions at once ""Patch Adams"" runs amok for a while but ultimately manages to become bright and substantive entertainment by letting the main character occasionally drop his aggressive cheerfulness to show his aching heart and the earnestness of his mission to get doctors more engaged with patients. This nutty guy is first introduced as a brooding sensitive young man who admits himself to a mental hospital after having tried to commit suicide. Under the cold gaze of an uncaring shrink Adams discovers a knack for self-healing humor and tries it on other patients in his ward -- with instant success. Adams later enrolls in Virginia Medical College and tries out his clown persona there backing up his antics with a passion for treating even the most gravely ill patients as individuals. In most cases the responses to his outrageousness are an inspiration -- one particularly tough case is a bitter terminally ill cancer patient played by Peter Coyote. His chief nemesis is a pompous dean who hates touchy-feely methods and wants the academically successful Adams thrown out on his ear. Adams also offends an overly serious roommate wonderfully played by Hoffman who cant muster a human touch. A side plot involves Adams affection for Carin a pretty fellow medical student (appealingly played by Potter) who at first wont give him the time of day because she thinks hes a kook. He bonds with Truman another medical dreamer (London) who becomes Adams main defender and a supporter of his goal to set up a free clinic. The film is shamelessly manipulative but it has enough heart -- underscored by an unexpected tragedy -- to hit home with anybody whos endured the impersonal side of modern medicine. And who hasnt?

B Youve Got Mail Genre Comedy Romance; Starring Tom Hanks Meg Ryan Dave Chappelle Dabney Coleman Greg Kinnear Parker Posey Jean Stapleton; Director Nora Ephron; Author Nora Ephron; Release Date Wide 12/18/1998; MPAA Rating PG; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted January 8 1999 -- 1200 AM EST Robin Williams has played doctors before hes played iconoclasts hes played nonconformists who display a sensitivity to human suffering far superior to that of the average human. Often these characters are funny and hyper-verbal propelled by the comedians restless wit and his craving for the emotional release he finds in improvisation. Always they make a big fat play for our admiration. (Such an inspiration to students in Dead Poets Society Such a gifted shrink in Good Will Hunting) But nothing Williams has done is quite as craven and full of horsefeathers as his star turn in Patch Adams an offensive and deeply false ""inspirational"" drama that idiotically indicts the entire medical profession in the service of making one man -- Adams which is to say Williams -- look like a cockeyed saint. The movie directed by Tom Shadyac and written by Steve Oedekerk with a calculated smarm youd never expect from two men behind the Ace Ventura films is based on a true story There really is a Dr. Hunter ""Patch"" Adams who having overcome his own depression has devoted his life to helping others in pain using humor as a tool; hes the founder of the Gesundheit Institute and he takes clowning seriously. But no one takes clowning as egotistically as the Adams created by Williams. Enrolled in medical school -- supposedly in the late 1960s but for all intents and purposes in a Victorian age when a Scrooge-like dean (Bob Gunton) stresses a doctors need to eradicate his or her own humanity -- Adams questions authority at every turn. ""Illegally"" visiting hospital patients (hes a first-year student and only third-year students are allowed) he miraculously lifts their spirits by putting an enema bulb on his nose or rubber gloves on his head. And oh how his audience beams Horribly weak children lift their little bald heads their cancers nothing compared with his mighty talent. Nurses (all of them grossly undervalued of course) laugh at his antics like delighted lovers. A violent dying man (Peter Coyote) lets go of his terrible rage when Adams sings ""Blue Skies."" Fellow students -- notably a pretty grind (Monica Potter) and a devoted sidekick (Daniel London) -- look at their leader as nothing less than a god. Only the evil dean and the cartoonishly heartless medical establishment he represents are threatened by Patchs unconventional ways. ""I want to really listen to people"" Adams burbles when he discovers his lifes calling. But with Williams prancing so shamelessly Patch Adams doesnt leave room for anyone else to breathe let alone speak. It goes down like medicine. And the side effects are toxic.

"Patch Adams (PG-13) Related Item ""Patch Adams"" showtimes Patch Adams By Rita Kempley Washington Post Staff Writer Friday December 25 1998 ""Patch Adams"" and Robin Williams dont quite hit it on the nose. (Universal) Director Tom Shadyac Cast Robin Williams; Monica Potter; Philip Seymour Hoffman; Bob Gunton; Daniel London; Peter Coyote; Michael Jeter; Richard Kiley Running Time 1 hour 45 minutes Contains some strong language and crude humor If laughter is the best medicine ""Patch Adams"" is but a sugary fitfully amusing placebo. Indeed those in sore need of busting a gut had better look elsewhere for comic relief. Loosely based on an autobiography by Arlingtons own Hunter ""Patch"" Adams M.D. the feel-good-or-else movie stars Robin Williams as a zany physician who believes in the curative powers of love compassion and comedy and risks his career to sell this philosophy to the medical establishment. Of course the establishment is not receptive to his radical credo which includes wearing a bulbous red nose while clowning around with ones patients. But Patch does attract a few disciples including the nurses who see the positive effect his hijinks have on the patients. While a medical student at a Virginia college Patch and his followers open a free clinic in a rural community and are subsequently accused of practicing medicine without a license. This sets up a trial before the state medical board where Patch eloquently pleads his case and makes his points about the sorry state of national health care. Williams at his most beatific brings warmth compassion and the customary mania to the character who changes not one whit over the course of the movie. Though he goes from a mental patient to fully functioning physician Patch remains the same saintly soul from beginning to end. Tom Shadyac directs from a screenplay by Steve Oedekerk a stand-up comedian who collaborated with Shadyac on ""Ace Ventura Pet Detective"" and ""The Nutty Professor."" Perhaps the two were intimidated by the reality-based material which they have treated with undue reverence and timidity. The expiration date on this pill has definitely expired.

I just got done watching the latest Robin Williams smarm-alarm ""Patch Adams"" so Im in a fighting mood. Though he really does seem like a swell person Ive always liked Williams better in theory than I do in practice. And this blubbering ass-kiss of a movie is very possibly the last straw. ""Good Morning Vietnam"" ""Dead Poets Society"" ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" ... shades of gray dont exist in Robin Williams World just real mean people and real nice people. The extremely difficult-to-miss message of ""Patch Adams"" (and its the same message you get in all of Williams most successful comedies) is that peace and love would soon reign supreme if everybody would just improvise 100 miles a minute and talk in funny voices when confronted with emotionally complex situations. Theatrical preview for ""Patch Adams"" Windows Media 28k or 56k Real 28k or 56k Clip ""Patch clowns around"" Video clip 2.6Mb QuickTime Laughter can cleanse the world Cant we all see that? Why are we so blind to the healing power of big drippy gooey gloppy sentimental laughter? (Now Im acting like an insect and slamming into the wall Now Im talking like John Wayne Now Im prancing around like a gay hairdresser Somebody stop my irrepressible spirit) No subtle zest for life here Good golly that Patch Adams has a zest for life that you and I can only dream of The guy that Williams is supposed to be playing this time around is a real-life doctor who evidently insists on acting ""zany"" around his patients rather than coldly treating them like mere statistics. Boiled down to blockbuster Esperanto that means that he wants to be real nice while other doctors -- who as we all know dont care one little bit about anybody whether theyre sick or not -- are real mean. So Williams puts on a very subtle clown nose. Hes not really a doctor during the movie by the way. Hes just a wacky life-affirming med student who was once locked up in a mental hospital. During his internment he quickly realized that big drippy gooey sentimental laughter can work wonders on manic depressives. This is illustrated -- in full-color black-and-white -- when Patch helps a hysterical patient (played by Michael Jeter) ""shoot"" a bunch of imaginary squirrels that he sees running around his hospital room. Ha Ha Ha Patch is pretending he sees the squirrels too The violins on the soundtrack swell their approval so you know its working. This is just what that poor man has needed all along Why couldnt all those doctors see it? The fact that hes still going to be delusional when the scene is finished simply doesnt enter into it. Those violins are the same thing as being cured. ALSO The real Dr. Patch Adams says Gesundheit His immediate success in ridding the room of pretend squirrels soon convinces Patch that he should go to medical school and become a doctor. Apparently they teach you how to kill all kinds of nonexistent rodents in medical school. And if the doctors there are more concerned with inhumane stuff like research and proven medication why Patchll show em Hell just have to comically walk around the chemotherapy ward while wearing bedpans for shoes. And if that doesnt work hell make balloon animals wake patients up in the middle of the night and have them take target practice with rubber-band guns. My dad (God rest his soul) just died of cancer a few months ago and I guarantee you a nurse would have soon been extracting a balloon giraffe from Adams wacky life-affirming rectum if hed tried this groundbreaking technique on him. Box office no indicator ""Patch Adams"" is absolutely awful and it made 25 million bucks this past weekend. I realize that in a lot of minds that automatically makes me wrong but this is a classic case of people plopping down the cost of a ticket to see a reenactment of the movies poster. As soon as I laid eyes on that poster I knew we were in for trouble. Theres Williams wearing his clown nose and in full sugar-gush staring down as a small childs hand reaches up to squeeze his melancholy nose. A sick childs hand. A small sick childs hand. This image is the equivalent of being punched in the heart with a fistful of dollars. Williams is being sold like an Oscar-winning Muppet. Aside from a ridiculous tear-jerking plot twist that I wont type for fear of debasing my fingertips the other characters are just there to have their floundering spirits lifted by Patch or to angrily stand in his way while he tries to soak the vicinity with his unbridled wonderfulness. Chief among the real mean people is Patchs dean played by Bob Gunton. Guntons so obviously the bad guy he oughta be wearing a black cowboy hat. He constantly belittles St. Patchs ""flighty theories of goodness"" and says understated things like ""Patients dont need a friend They need a doctor"" Just in case you didnt know what was going on three seconds after the movie started. This is written by Steve Oedekerk and directed by Tom Shadyac the team behind the ""Ace Ventura"" movies (our motto ""more-more-more"") so the complete absence of a light touch isnt exactly a shock. But ""Babe Pig in the City"" has more to do with real human emotions than this thing does no matter how often Oedekerk and Shadyac pretend that Patch is the only health care person on earth whos capable of actually feeling anything. God help us; I smell an unbelievably mawkish sitcom on the horizon. ""Patch Adams"" contains some bad language and instances of frat-boy rude humor. If you have any self-respect youll want to slap that nose off Williams face...though if people had any self-respect the movie wouldnt have already made 25 million dollars. Rated PG-13. 110 minutes roughly 60 of which are comprised of reaction shots of Williams ""looking compassionate.""

"Patch Adams | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; patch-adams ) Patch Adams (United States 1998) A movie review by James Berardinelli What is the difference between a bad melodrama and a good one? The key lies in the emotional response. If the viewer feels that he or she is being forced into reacting in a particular way because of ""button pushing"" the film makers have erred. While manipulation is almost always mandatory in a melodrama it should be accomplished in such a way that no one in the audience is conscious of it at the time. Emotional high points should evolve naturally out of the plot; the storyline should not be constructed around those moments. Movies like Forrest Gump and Titanic capture the finer aspects of melodrama. Failed efforts like Patch Adams spend too much time trying to reduce the audience to tears through a series of cheap transparent ploys. This is yet another of those ""based on a true story..."" feel-good movies thats designed to make us believe that there are two kinds of human beings - free-spirits (who are the good guys) and establishment-types (who are inevitably villains). The title character played by Robin Williams in one of his familiar dramatic/comedic turns is a mental patient who during his stint in the Fairfax State Psychiatric Ward decides that he wants to go to school to become a doctor. So upon his release in 1971 the 40-something year old man enrolls in the Virginia Medical University. However while the teachers preach book learning and emotional detachment Patch believes that to treat a disease the physician should connect with his patients. While his attitude is embraced by some of his fellow students including a pretty co-ed named Carin Fischer (Monica Potter) Dean Walcott (Bob Gunton) forbids Patch to have contact with real patients and when he disobeys he finds himself in danger of being thrown out of medical school. The film is directed by Tom Shadyac who helmed the first Ace Ventura movie and written by Steve Oedekerk who was behind the camera for the second (the pair also teamed up on the Eddie Murphy remake of The Nutty Professor). While these two arguably have some skill at comedy they have little or none when it comes to drama. Patch Adams isnt much more than a series of overdone emotional scenes connected by a conventional plot line. Anyone interested in exploring a better approach to the same basic ideas should check out The Doctor in which William Hurt plays a surgeon who learns about the coldness of the medical profession when he becomes a patient. In Patch Adams there are moments of supposed emotional warmth as Patch connects with dying patients towering sadness as he recites poetry over the coffin of a lost friend and triumph as he overcomes the forces aligned against him. And as is seemingly obligatory in this kind of film theres a big speech at the end - one that makes Al Pacinos tirade in Scent of a Woman seem subtle by comparison. (It is perhaps worth noting however that few of the films jokes involves flatulence so maybe Shadyac and Oedekerk are trying to display some maturity.) Robin Williams who won an Oscar for his beautifully-understated role in Good Will Hunting wavers between being effective and going over-the-top. From time-to-time he has genuinely funny moments (when Patch Adams goes for comedy its not half bad) but for the most part the dramatic aspect of his performance is off. Hes forcing the audiences emotional response. And although attempting to replicate his work in Dead Poets Society Williams is working with a script that isnt as polished so some of his scenes come across as overwrought instead of heartbreaking. The supporting cast is peppered with familiar faces. Monica Potter most recently seen in the Prefontaine biography Without Limits is Patchs much younger girlfriend. Daniel London is the first of his student converts. Philip Seymour Hoffman (the prank phone caller in Happiness) is Patchs straitlaced roommate. Bob Gunton is Dean Walcott the personification of evil. Michael Jeter is Patchs mental ward cellmate. Irma P.Hall is a nurse at the hospital where Patch works his magic and Peter Coyote is a cranky cancer patient who becomes one of Patchs greatest successes. Patch Adams is slated for a Christmas Day release presumably because Universal Pictures believes audiences are more susceptible to this kind of half-baked storytelling during the season of good will. However with the even more cloying Stepmom arriving on the same day theres bound to be a run on Kleenexes. Patch Adams is the kind of film that will work for an audience thats just interested in having an emotional experience (with a happy ending) without caring how obviously or clumsily they are manipulated. I find this sort of sledgehammer film making to be offensive but there are those who enjoy it. Somehow though I dont think there are enough viewers with such a low quality threshold to right Universal Pictures floundering financial ship. Patch Adams is another miscalculation by a studio that hasnt done much right all year.
