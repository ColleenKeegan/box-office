Mimicking a traditional movie tuner director Rob Hardys script allows for plenty of gospel music to bridge the gaps in his slight drama centered around a struggling Atlanta church. An ego-maniacal Baptist reverend and a sexy pop star who has drifted from his Christian roots stumble toward redemptions of a sort in ""The Gospel"" a creaky melodrama that wants to be a musical. Mimicking a traditional movie tuner director Rob Hardys script allows for plenty of gospel music to bridge the gaps in his slight drama centered around a struggling Atlanta church. Pic will find its target auds with families Christian groups and gospel fans especially in cities with solid African American congregants. Already displaying his chops and charisma young David (Michael J. Pagan) leads rapturous churchgoers in song and is planning to become a minister as is his pal Frank (Sean Nelson). When Davids father Bishop Taylor (Clifton Powell) arrives too late to be with his wife when she dies at a hospital David lashes out at him and runs away. Fifteen years later (and presumably in the present) David (Boris Kodjoe) has become an Ramp;B star with his sexy new hit ""Let Me Undress You"" and has obviously flown far from his old Baptist flock including dad. Word that Bishop Taylor is ailing however brings David back home to Atlanta where he finds a financially-troubled church with a gifted choir. Frank (Idris Elba) who has become a reverend and is set to inherit Taylors ministry is immediately resentful of Davids sudden re-appearance and his use of his star power to help the church. To make Franks life worse wife Charlene (Nona Gaye) is infertile and feels uninspired to have sex. From the moment that David gives tips to the chorus takes up with soloist Rain (Tamyra Gray) and arranges to produce a fund-raiser for the church its clear that the prodigal son is destined to return to the flock. Its just as obvious that Hardys drama is intent on making the supposedly devout Frank the heavy particularly after Taylor dies and Frank assumes leadership with all the self-inflated ego of a Jim Bakker. With visions of an evangelical empire dancing in his brain Frank has an unerring ability for repelling everyone around him from Charlene to church vet Minister Hunter (Donnie McClurkin). David has his own little dramas involving a music deal gone bad and Rains ex (Dwayne Boyd) suddenly showing up. But the passionately performed music numbers -- most written by Kirk Franklin and performed by a dynamic chorus under Keith Wilsons direction -- come along frequently enough to keep the increasingly awkward dramatics from sinking ""The Gospel"" altogether. As in a musical whose book is several miles behind its music and lyrics the tunes provide some blessed breaks to let the movie breath a little. Hardy tends to urge his thesps to push obvious emotional buttons but Kodjoe goes for a subtler approach that makes him quite watchable. Powell always a reliable supporting actor holds up his end like a rock while Elba indulges in bad-guy long stares. Pic is undermined by a TV-scale look and Fernando Villenas senselessly hyperactive editing. In contrast to Franklins genuine gospel Stanley A. Smiths score verges on muzak.

Like art or porn you know it when you see it you dig it or you dont. But its the earthly drama preceding the evangelical money shot that distinguishes this near-musical about a newly minted Ramp;B star (Boris Kodjoe) drawn back into his estranged fathers Atlanta ministry. Its a rich portrait of a church in transition and while the climactic come-to-Jesus is never in doubt The Wires lupine Idris Elba as the hungry successor to the ailing pastor threatens to turn this into a complex picture even as The Gospel falls predictably to its knees with a satisfying thud.

"Music redeems confused Gospel - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Music redeems confused Gospel By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  October 7 2005 The Gospel"" opens as a gospel movie should in midshout. The choir of Atlantas fictional New Revelations church tears into He Reigns"" the camera bounces off the walls with joy and the audience settles in to be uplifted.What follows is a letdown a heartfelt but muddled melodrama about an Ramp;B singers crisis of faith and the church politics that ensnare him when he goes home to visit his dying father. Dramatically simplistic and crowded with too many characters saddled with too many motivations Rob Hardys film is at its best when it just steps back and lets the voices rip. When you sing in the choir its called praise"" one character reminds the hero and the movie simply isnt praiseworthy enough.Its smooth stuff for a while if overly hyperactive during the musical numbers. After an opener establishing the young David Taylors estrangement from his churchaholic pop Pastor Fred (Clifton Powell of Ray"") The Gospel"" jumps ahead 15 years to find David (Boris Kodjoe) transformed into an LA-based soul stud with a hit single a happily avaricious manager (Omar Gooding) and a fan base of panting women. Returning home after a discreet phone call from a family friend alerts him to fathers delicate condition the prodigal son steps gingerly into the churchs Sunday services and its back-office war of succession. The spirit moves him and so does that cute singer in the front row.Her name is Rain played by Tamyra Gray with enough fire and vocal chops to back up the grousing over her unceremonious booting from American Idol"" a few seasons back. Certainly she has more going on than Kodjoe whos as handsome and as dull as a painted god. The movie gives Rain an adorable daughter (China Anne McLain) an estranged husband (Dwayne Boyd) and a split-screen love montage with David -- anything to keep these two from falling into bed. This is a ministry movie after all and its faith in people as well as the Lord is a pleasant change of pace.The Gospel"" keeps piling on the subplots though. Davids childhood pal is now the Reverend Frank (Idris Elba of HBOs The Wire"") an ambitious Bible-pounder who wants to lead New Revelations into the 21st century with himself as its all-media star. Before going to his reward Pastor Fred passes Frank the baton angering his longtime number two (Donnie McClurkin) and setting the stage for David to take a more prominent role. Meanwhile Franks wife Charlene (Nona Gaye) alternates between Lady Macbeth machinations and tearful outbursts over her inability to have a child.A little character ambiguity is a good thing but Hardys screenplay is just confused; by the end youre not sure how youre supposed to feel about any of these people other than that theyre all good souls at heart. Nice message problematic storytelling and when The Gospel"" brings on real-life gospel stars like Yolanda Adams and Fred Hammond the sonic explosion is tinged with a sense of relief. The movies worth seeing if youre moved by the music but bring some patience too. Gods eye is on the sparrow when it should have been on the script. Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

See next articles See previous articles Site Navigation Site Mobile Navigation Advertisement Supported by Movies | FILM IN REVIEW A Church Welcomes Home a Wayward Son By LAURA KERNOCT. 7 2005 Continue reading the main story Share This Page Continue reading the main story Opens today nationwide Directed by Rob Hardy Rated PG; 105 minutesSet against a lively music-filled African-American church ""The Gospel"" written and directed by Rob Hardy and loosely inspired by ""The Prodigal Son"" parable from the New Testament endeavors to be a powerful tale of faith and forgiveness but in the end fails to capture even the slightest essence of spirituality and religious belief or to provide any real insight into its characters conflicts desires and motivations.After his mother dies David Taylor (Boris Kodjoe) rejects the church and his father (Clifton Powell) a bishop who was too wrapped up in Gods work to be with his wife during her final minutes. Young David perhaps a bit melodramatically throws down his Bible and renounces his former desire to follow in his fathers footsteps.Flash forward 15 years to Los Angeles where David now a successful rhythm and blues singer is enjoying the perks of stardom free-flowing cash fancy hotel suites and sexy women. At his side is his loyal manager Wesley (Omar Gooding a spitting image of his brother Cuba Jr. who starred in his own gospel-choir flick ""The Fighting Temptations"" two years ago). When David hears of his fathers declining health he decides to return home to Atlanta where the financially struggling church congregation inevitably sucks him in. He also becomes desperately attracted to Rain (Tamyra Gray) because she is the first woman in ages who doesnt instantly fall for his smooth-operator charm.Many talented real-life gospel superstars (including Donnie McClurkin in a significant role and Yolanda Adams singing as herself) are blended into the large and able cast to add a touch of authenticity. But when not in song the words that come out of the frustratingly undefined characters mouths are mostly awkward and contribute to the films overall incoherent narrative. Its not clear what drives David to hold a grudge against his father for so long. And the central longstanding rivalry of David and his childhood schoolmate Charles Frank (Idris Elba) who is lined up as Davids fathers successor as well as the personal struggles between Charles and his wife Charlene (Nona Gaye) arent fleshed out enough to create solid conflicts.""The Gospel"" only scratches the surface of some topics worthy of exploration like the connection between gospel music and pop music and the workings of the church and show business which share similar political showmanship and ego issues. Unlike actual soulful and infectious live church services this muddled film probably wont inspire people to jump out of their seats.""The Gospel"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has adult themes and suggested sexuality.LAURA KERN Continue reading the main story Were interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think. Whats Next Loading...
