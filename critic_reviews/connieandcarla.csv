"Connie and Carla Corny Chuckles washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids Connie and Carla Corny Chuckles Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday April 16 2004 LIKE AN EXTRA large pizza ""Connie and Carla"" is broad and cheesy yet it is not utterly without a kind of junk-food appeal. Exactly how broad is this ""Some Like It Hot""-inspired comedy about a pair of second-rate singers (Nia Vardalos and Toni Collette) who pose as male drag queens in order to hide from a mobster named Rudy (Robert John Burke)? ""I Love Lucy"" broad. ""Laverne amp; Shirley"" broad. Put it this way. When Connie (Vardalos) and Carla (Collette) first see men kissing in West Hollywood where they have fled after witnessing a drug shooting back home in the Midwest you can practically hear their jaws bounce off the floor. I guess in the small burg they hail from there are no homosexuals just cocaine dealers which is strange considering how easily the two take to what another character calls the ""drag code of conduct"" camping it up with heavy makeup and a love of over-the-top show tunes. See there are two kinds of people in the world who still love musicals at least according to Vardaloss energetic if overly obvious script elderly hicks and gay men. (Three if you count Rudys ""Mame""-loving Slavic henchman Tibor played by Boris McGiver whom his boss sends off to scour the dinner theaters of the American hinterlands in search of the fugitives.) Then theres Connie and Carla themselves gotta-sing naifs who go from the obscurity of belting out Broadway standards to unappreciative strangers in the airport travelers lounge back home to being the toast of gay Los Angeles when their self-titled revue becomes a smash. Thats because unlike many drag acts they dont lip-sync. Whats more they look really ""authentic."" As a further example of the films high comedic standards one sight gag involves a quartet of drag queens feeling up Connies ample - and very real - chest in an impromptu inspection of the quality of her ""falsies."" But thats not the bit I laughed out loud at. That came when David Duchovny who plays Jeff the straight brother of one of Connie and Carlas drag pals (Stephen Spinella) introduces his homophobic girlfriend. ""Her name is Mary?"" asks a drag queen in a shocked sotto voce aside over the fact that the appellation might be more than a generic nom de guerre for the members of the cross-dressing demimonde. Okay so I prefer understated to hammer-over-the-head yuks. But the films generally sitcom-calibre comedy is not its only problem. Take the premise for instance. Considering Connie and Carlas willingness to go underground at the first sign of trouble it hardly seems likely that they would pose much of a legal threat to Rudy. But then theres that kilo of cocaine that the women inadvertently took from him. A kilo it should be noted that Connie and Carla dont even have anymore given that they dumped the contents in their wood-paneled station wagon on the way out to L.A. And anyway considering how much Tibor has been spending on theater tickets especially during a stopover in Manhattan can the hunt for our heroines really be cost effective? All the same Vardalos and Collette make believable drag queens. And Duchovny as Connies uptight and unattainable love interest has a goofy low-key likability. Lastly the films none-too-subliminal message - that you should be yourself no matter what that looks like is hard to argue with. It may not be subtle but like drag itself ""Connie and Carla"" affords a few corny if artless pleasures. CONNIE AND CARLA (PG-13 98 minutes) - Contains an off-camera shooting some drug content and mildly crude sexual humor. Area theaters.

(AP Photo/Eike Schroter) ... more Photo EIKE SCHROTER Bad lounge singers find niche in drag but Connie and Carla is same old song 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Connie and Carla. Comedy. Starring Nia Vardalos Toni Collette David Duchovny Stephen Spinella Boris McGiver and Debbie Reynolds. Directed by Michael Lembeck. Written by Nia Vardalos. (PG-13. 97 minutes. At Bay Area theaters). Audiences at a West Hollywood club are impressed by the drag queens Connie and Carla because they belt out their musical numbers instead of merely lip-syncing. Yet nobody seems to notice how feminine these headliners sound or how naturally curvaceous they appear. Made up with multicolored eye shadow and thick layers of fake lashes Connie and Carla come on like Elizabeth Taylor in ""Cleopatra."" But its obvious no Marc Antony lurks beneath their elaborate getups. Movies about cross-dressers -- a genre ""Connie and Carla"" loosely belongs to -- rarely hinge on believability. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon werent convincing as women in ""Some Like It Hot"" and no one would mistake Julie Andrews for a real man in ""Victor/Victoria."" Humor was mined from the fact that the gender switch was so transparent. ""Connie and Carla"" goes for farce as well but doesnt go far enough. The movie adds a layer of complication to the mix -- the title characters respectively played by ""My Big Fat Greek Weddings"" Nia Vardalos and Toni Collette masquerade as men pretending to be women. Its a clever idea but Vardalos the screenwriter as well as star cant quite pull it off. The subterfuge becomes necessary after Connie and Carla witness a mob hit at OHare as they bore weary travelers with an inept lounge act. The two then flee to Los Angeles because they think its the last place a hit man would look for them. ""Theres no musical theater -- no culture at all there"" says Connie one of the movies numerous digs at L.A. Someone should tell Vardalos this is well-trod territory. ""Connie and Carla"" is at its most entertaining when ""the girls"" are onstage. Their talent which was far from obvious before they discovered drag blossoms with the enthusiastic response of their gay patrons. Vardalos and Collette really can sing and dance and they throw themselves into a best of Broadway medley swinging from ""Cabaret"" to ""Evita"" to ""Gypsy"" with appropriate costume changes. The fabulous Debbie Reynolds joins them for a performance at the club game as ever in a red sequin ensemble with a serious slit up the side. Theres a funny running gag about a Russian henchman (broadly played by Boris McGiver) who becomes enamored with the musicals he watches around the country hoping to spot Connie and Carla. In Kansas City he snaps his fingers and joins in on the refrain from ""Mame."" Its enough to make you nostalgic for dinner theater. But ""Connie and Carla"" loses its snap when the music stops. ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" worked because of Vardalos familiarity and affection for the subject. But she didnt grow up in a family of drag queens and the knowledge shes gleaned of their lives at least as evidenced in her script is very thin. At times ""Connie and Carla"" aims to be ""La Cage Aux Folles Redux."" You halfway expect the drag queens to burst into ""I Am What I Am."" But Vardalos isnt up to interpreting that lifestyle and ""La Cage"" already has been remade into ""The Birdcage"" a far funnier and more poignant portrayal of men who dress as women. A subplot involving an attempted reconciliation between a straight brother Jeff (David Duchovny) and a gay one (Stephen Spinella) is right out of a lame TV movie of the week and wastes the talents of both actors. Caught up in the drag world Jeff finds himself strangely attracted to Connie. One advantage of being the screenwriter is that you can match yourself up with the best-looking actors. Unfortunately Duchovny and Vardalos have zero chemistry. A romance might have been believable had he been paired with Collette who is physically more his type. It also would have given Collette an actress of great depth when given the right material more to do. As it is shes reduced to playing a yes- man to Vardalos. Connie and Carla are supposed to be best friends since childhood yet little of their storied friendship is reflected onscreen. Vardalos is a gifted comedienne and writer but she needs the right vehicle. A TV spin-off of ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" wasnt it despite her ability to come up with one-liners. ""Connie and Carla"" contains a few too many of the kind of lines that cry out for a laugh track. ""Drive Thelma drive"" Carla tells Connie as they make their getaway from Chicago. ""I had this girlfriend once who told me I had issues about getting too close so I stopped talking to her"" Jeff confesses to Connie. ""Why is it called drag? Nobody drags anything"" Connie ponders. At least Vardalos stays away from referencing ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding."" The closest she comes is when Connie worries about getting so fat that shell need olive oil to zip up her dress. I see a sequel in the works ""My Big Fat Greek Drag Queen."" -- Advisory This film contains some off-color jokes.

"Connie and Carla | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Review Connie and Carla David Rooney 0 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr April 12 2004 | 1200AM PT The same unrelenting good-naturedness demonstrated by Nia Vardalos in ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" helps smooth the erratic energy levels and sloppy plot mechanics of ""Connie and Carla."" Basically ""Some Like it Hot""-meets-""Victor/Victoria"" this campy concoction is unlikely to repeat the feat of Vardalos indie phenomenon. It takes chutzpah to borrow from comedy maestros Billy Wilder and Blake Edwards and Nia Vardalos would seem an unlikely candidate to get away with it unpunished. But the same unrelenting good-naturedness demonstrated by the screenwriter-star in ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" helps smooth the erratic energy levels and sloppy plot mechanics of ""Connie and Carla."" Basically ""Some Like it Hot""-meets-""Victor/Victoria"" this campy concoction is unlikely to repeat the feat of Vardalos indie phenomenon but women and gay men should drive the Universal release to respectable numbers. Hipper than ""Greek Wedding"" though marked by the same sitcom semblance and by a certain ingenuousness both endearing and limiting the cheerful drag comedy is more broadly palatable than ""The Adventures of Priscilla Queen of the Desert"" and less tiresomely syrupy and message-driven than ""To Wong Foo Thanks For Everything Julie Newmar."" It also boasts a considerable asset in the redoubtable Toni Collette not seen in such an unequivocally comedic role since ""Muriels Wedding."" Small-town girls with big showbiz dreams Connie (Vardalos) and Carla (Collette) work as cocktail waitresses in a Chicago lounge bar where their indulgent boss Frank (Michael Roberds) lets them perform show tunes for the indifferent customers. But when they witness Franks murder at the hands of drug lord Rudy (Robert John Burke) and his Russian henchman Tibor (Boris McGiver) the girls are forced to dump their loser boyfriends Al (Nick Sandow) and Mikey (Dash Mihok) and skip town unwittingly carrying a kilo of cocaine. Looking for a culture-free zone where no one would think to track aspiring artistes Connie and Carla settle on Los Angeles. They wander by chance into a West Hollywood drag bar where the departing resident act has created a talent vacancy. Disguising themselves as drag queens with industrial-strength makeup and big-haired wigs the girls wow the crowd by singing live rather than the usual lip-synching. Overnight the act is a sensation with amusing renditions of numbers from ""Cabaret"" ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" and ""Evita"" among others belted out in confident brassy style by Vardalos and Collette. Careful not to blow their cover Connie and Carla maintain the cross-dressing disguise with the drag queens that live in their building who eventually wheedle their way into the act as backup. Among these is Robert (Stephen Spinella) attempting to reconcile with his straight brother Jeff (David Duchovny) after years of family estrangement. Connies undercover existence is complicated by an awkward mutual attraction to Jeff. Meanwhile Tibor has combed Broadway and the nations dinner theaters and come no closer to finding the fugitives. However when Al and Mikey end up working for Rudy the mobster learns of the girls whereabouts and tails their lovelorn boyfriends to L.A. His long sitcom history gives director Michael Lembeck (""The Santa Clause 2"") confidence with the dialogue-driven scenes and musical numbers are enjoyably handled. But the chaotic denouement during which everyone descends on the girls as they open a glitzy new show is clumsily choreographed and a little untidy. While Vardalos writing is far from sophisticated the quips keep coming. Steady laughs are milked out of the good-hearted ribbing of queer culture and the gay-straight clash -- even if it does seem unlikely anyone in an environment like West Hollywood would ever be perturbed by supposed drag queen freakishness. Poignancy is supplied via the hesitant bonding of the two brothers thanks in part to an affably relaxed turn from Duchovny and sensitive dignified playing by legit actor Spinella. Where the writing feels undernourished is in a moralistic sideline advanced by Carla. Elsewhere the films refusal to push the self-acceptance agenda too hard is refreshing. Like Julie Andrews in ""Victor/Victoria"" neither star looks especially convincing as a female impersonating a female impersonator. But Collettes gleeful lack of vanity in assuming grotesque rubber-lipped expressions makes hers the more successful stab at it while Vardalos relies more on a series of flashy wigs and on Ruth Myers colorful heavily sequined costumes. In all departments Collette is far more nuanced her timing sharper and her comic skills more inventive than her co-stars nonetheless vivacious appealing performance but the camaraderie between the two is infectious.

The movies premise is obvious from the titles tagline Girls will be boys will be girls. Universal And seeing the writer and star of My Big Fat Greek Wedding pull some of the same lame sight gags and give nearly identical line readings in Connie and Carla her sophomore effort one wonders how her first film ever became such a hit. But for all of Weddings mediocrity Connie and Carla is even more of a drag. (Related video See a clip from Connie and Carla) ABOUT THE MOVIE Connie and Carla  1/2 (out of four) Stars Nia Vardalos Toni Collette David Duchovny Stephen Spinella Director Michael Lembeck Distributor Universal Studios Rating PG-13 for thematic elements sexual humor and drug references Opens Friday nationwide The movies premise is obvious from the titles tagline Girls will be boys will be girls. Connie and Carla (Vardalos and Toni Collette) are childhood best friends obsessed with entertaining even if it means singing show tunes in school cafeterias and nearly empty airport lounges. When they finally get a dinner-theater gig near their Midwestern hometown they inadvertently blunder into a drug deal gone bad. Suddenly theyre wanted by a pair of hapless criminals and forced to run for their lives. Their idiotic hiding place is Hollywood where they decide to test their talents and seek their fortune. After a few bad career stops the big-haired gals -- who come off as a loopy singing-and-dancing Laverne and Shirley -- stumble into their dream job drag queens at a small club thats gaining cachet as a cool hangout. Their stage moniker Belles of the Balls. One of the drawbacks is they cant blow their cover as men which puts a crimp in their social lives as straight women. Had Connie and Carla been done right it could have been a throwback to an earlier era an homage to Some Like It Hot. Or if it had been contemporary and edgy it might have come across as a gender-bending Thelma and Louise or another Victor Victoria. But Vardalos comedic style is old-fashioned in the worst way; her humor is stodgier than the most retro Catskills laughmeister. She repeats comic setups that werent funny the first time (as in ""Your voice is giving me shingles"" followed by ""Your voice is giving me mono"") and she has no deftness with physical humor. Thanks simply to her strong features she is physically convincing as a transvestite -- more so than the more delicate Collette anyway. But the best moments in Connie and Carla involve the supporting cast of drag queens and criminals. Along with the show tunes and hoofing come feeble self-empowerment platitudes. Its one cliche after another -- such as ""Worship that body its the only one you got"" -- amid the constant discussion of following ones dream. Too bad this one proved to be a nightmare.

The two have an ""act"" that consists of dressing up in costume and singing happily over-the-top versions of show tunes at an airport lounge; none of the bored travelers on hand pay them the slightest attention. Then in a variation on ""Some Like It Hot"" the heroines of Connie and Carla witness a nasty bit of criminal hanky-panky and hightail it to L.A. where they slather on eye glitter and pass themselves off as female impersonators landing a gig at a drag queen cabaret called the Handlebar. There without trying too hard they achieve the drag divas torch song dream of becoming the women theyre ""pretending"" to be. In the real world theyre pathetic nobodies but in the cheesy sequined demimonde of cross-dressing musical kitsch theyre stars The women-posing-as-men-posing-as-women gambit was scarcely outrageous - or very funny - when director Blake Edwards tried it in 1982 in ""Victor/Victoria."" If anything its milder here. Nia Vardalos with her playful come-hither saucer eyes is an appealing actress and Collette who looks like Picassos Dora Maar on the Atkins diet is a vaguely scary one. In their offbeat-sitcom way theyre a vivid enough team yet Vardalos in her follow-up to ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" (she wrote both scripts) crams the movie with as many self-esteem lessons as an ""Oprah""/""Dr. Phil"" marathon and she manages to do for men in wigs and dresses what she did for Greeks turn them into disposable cartoons. The heroines toss their curls and say ""Fabulous"" and the movie is broad enough to actually feature a repeated pun on the phrase ""Its a drag"" That said when Connie and Carla perform their belt-to-the-rafters versions of ""Maybe This Time"" and ""Dont Cry for Me Argentina"" and ""What I Did for Love"" this chintzy contraption comes to shameless spangly life. Considering how badly their act went over in airports you may wonder at their ability to bring down the house but the surprise - and intermittent delight - of ""Connie and Carla"" is the way that it taps into the everybody-is-a-star passion of the new sing-along culture. The film presents operatic drag queen performance in its bombast and overkill its fever of putting on a persona and letting it shine as the original underground version of ""American Idol."" Connie befriends Peaches an impersonator so maudlin with self-loathing that he might have stepped out of ""The Boys in the Band."" Hes a pre-Stonewall relic yet the tender stage actor Stephen Spinella makes this cry-baby masochist work. David Duchovny plays Peaches very straight brother who finds himself strangely attracted to Connie even though he thinks shes a man. Had the film pushed the implications of this a little further it might have been an eye-opening romantic comedy instead of a droopy one that perks right up every time somebody sings.
