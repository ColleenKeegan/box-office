By Anthony Lane Tom Cruise and Alec Baldwin in Adam Shankmans film.   Credit Illustration by Ron Kurniawan As ""Rock of Ages"" gets going a pure young maiden sitting on a bus begins to sing. Her name is Sherrie Christian (Julianne Hough) and she is journeying from her home town in Oklahoma to the celestial city of Los Angeles. She is hardly the first to make such a trip; think of Cherie her near-namesake played by Marilyn Monroe in ""Bus Stop"" (1956) who sang with a crack in her voice and a hole in her tights. Cherie too was heading west ""Hollywood and Vine"" she cried hugging herself as if the dream could be held tight. At that moment you knew she would never get there. No such bum notes bedevil the latest traveller. True Sherrie has her suitcase stolen within minutes of arriving but heres the good news she meets a guy Not just any guy either but the comely Drew (Diego Boneta) who shares her plan to become a performing artist and more significant her hair style. The year is 1987 and so all the young dudes of whatever gender appear to have risen at dawn and stood in front of a Force 10 gale for half an hour to achieve sufficient sweep-back. Drew having found his soul mate arranges for her to wait tables at the Bourbon Room on the Sunset Strip. The joint is run by Dennis Dupree played by Alec Baldwin; at least I think its Alec Baldwin. Something gray and matted tinged with Baldwinism lopes across the screen from time to time but beyond that its hard to be precise. Also present are Russell Brand as Lonny Denniss writhing sidekick; Catherine Zeta-Jones as Patricia Whitmore the mayors wife who deems it her duty to wash all the filth including the Bourbon Room from the Strip; Tom Cruise as Stacee Jaxx who is not as you might think a friend of Jabba the Hutt but a monstrous god of rock complete with leather chaps and a jewel-studded codpiece into which I didnt inquire too closely; and Paul Giamatti as Paul Gill Stacees manager whose veins run with greed. None of these characters are drawn with any subtlety or care although all the relevant actors get to sing apparently undubbed which I guess is consolation of a kind. What they belt out instead of original compositions is a selection of muscular hits from the nineteen-eighties most of which I have spent the past quarter of a century trying fervently to forget. If however your heart still surrenders to ""Cant Fight This Feeling"" by REO Speedwagon here it is afresh reconstituted as a gay power ballad for Baldwin and Brand who deliver it while gazing into each others rheumy orbs. Hmm. How did we grow so shifty and embarrassed in the face of musical film? Why as a patron of ""Rock of Ages"" do I wish I had taken the precaution of entering the theatre drunk? When the passengers in ""Bus Stop"" broke into song after the opening credits or when Louis Armstrong did the same riding in his bus introducing ""High Society"" (1956) and rounding off briskly with the words ""End of song beginning of story"" we accepted this carolling of good cheer as the natural order of things. By the time Jon Voight took a bus to New York though in ""Midnight Cowboy"" (1969) all innocence was gone. There was still a fine tune--""Everybodys Talkin""--but it played inside Voights head and in ours acting as a sidelong sorrowful comment on what lay in store. From then on to voice your emotions in melodic form became for better or worse a joke. To do so within a dramatic setting--on the Berlin stage for instance in ""Cabaret"" (1972)--was just about acceptable but only a fool would risk it in the open air without a visible band and none but the happy throwbacks of ""Grease"" (1978) could get away with it. That is why when Sherrie inflated her lungs at the start of ""Rock of Ages"" and the people around her joined in the people around me in the cinema began to titter. How dumb could one blonde be? A single option remains for those wishing to save the genre camp it up. That is the choice made by Adam Shankman who directed ""Rock of Ages"" in transforming the Broadway musical of the same name. He did something similar with ""Hairspray"" (2007) and in neither case can we accuse him of lacking moxie or dodging his obligations. He takes an epoch rich in cheesiness and lays it on thick and pungent until it practically melts. No shoulder pad is too wide for his approval no groupie too quick to swoon no visual trope too threadbare. On Sherries first night she and Drew make nice beneath the Hollywood sign. ""Oh my God I cant believe Im actually here"" she says filing an early entry for the hokiest line in the film although Dennis soon outdoes her back at the club with ""We have to find an opener within the next two hours"" The problem for a director as knowing as Shankman is that whatever his energy level he cannot approach this kind of material without stepping into the zone of parody; once there however he has nothing left with which to lay claim upon our feelings. ""Rock of Ages"" is not a spoof but it might as well be given how little there is to root for. Even Cruise who ventures into no movie project without minutely calibrating its effect on his image seems to blur within our focus. One moment Stacee is all washed up and the next hes a one-man deluge of desire. Which is it? He closes with a roaring performance of ""Dont Stop Believin"" by Journey but if any song has been drained of force it is this one which was used not merely in films like ""The Wedding Singer"" and ""Yogi Bear"" but in both the finale of ""The Sopranos"" and the pilot episode of ""Glee."" It is perhaps the Gleeks--devout fans of the TV show with its calculated grab at naivete--who are being targeted by ""Rock of Ages."" After all they may be the last survivors who see nothing wrong in a spontaneous burst of song as practiced by Sherrie and Drew. The rest of us to our deep regret stopped believin long ago. To turn from ""Rock of Ages"" to ""Your Sisters Sister"" is like walking out of the Baboon Reserve at the Bronx Zoo and going home to your cats. Lynn Sheltons movie stars Emily Blunt who seems perpetually poised on the feline edge of a smile as if she either just got or is about to acquire the cream. She plays Iris who went out with a guy named Tom who died. We begin at a kind of delayed wake where Toms brother Jack (Mark Duplass)--bereaved bothered and bewildered--makes an awkward speech. Iris alarmed by his state of mind tells him to go and clear it by staying alone at her familys vacation cabin. This stands on a misty island off the coast of Washington but Jack on arrival gets a shock Iriss sister Hannah (Rosemarie DeWitt) is already in residence. So Jack a doughy sardonic carnivore is saddled with a tetchy lesbian vegan who eats dried banana out of a plastic bag. One night of tequila later they tumble into the sack. Not a success. Then Iris turns up. This could be the stuff of farce and Shelton does squeeze a measure of comic juice from the question of who is pretending not to know what of whom. There is also a hint of Bergman who was never more intent than when stranding two or three souls on a disenchanted isle; like him Shelton favors a steady diet of two-shot conversations flipping to and fro from one talking head to another. Yet the mood that she establishes is by and large as mild and unsavage as the weather devoid of the anxious intensity that Bergman sought to kindle and the light has a granular flatness shirking both blaze and gloom. This levelling look has to battle with the loveliness of Blunt which refuses to be tamped down even when she goes to bed in baggy sweat clothes and a tasselled hat. The dialogue is pitched equally low and is not easily mistaken for that of Congreve. ""You know its like it is what it is it sucks and it you know it was you know terrible obviously"" Jack says of life without his brother. If ""Your Sisters Sister"" improves on ""Humpday"" Sheltons previous work it is because that supposedly shocking film relied on a heavily wrought conceit whereas the plight of the people here is forged from everyday sticky materials such as grief abandonment and pancakes. Listen carefully for instance after a peeved Hannah has told Iris ""I love you but I dont like you"" and you should hear from the siblings in the auditorium a collective snuffled sigh of recognition. Only at the end do we sense Shelton forcing her hand and arranging rather too neatly for the rebalancing and de-saddening of all concerned. For a minute I even wondered if the sisters cabin in the woods had been like ""The Cabin in the Woods"" all along with creepy sniggering scientists controlling the characters every move.

Julianne Hough is singing the most sterile version of ""Sister Christian"" youve ever heard on a bus perfectly lit sitting alone (as buses from Oklahoma always lack for riders) with a Cheshire smile permanently affixed. She sings by herself ... right up until the moment when the rest of the bus joins in somehow surprising her as she thought bus singing was primarily a personal pursuit. Its then you realize what youre truly in for and the film pivots from ""potentially cheesy"" to a ""river of gooey cheese with Julianne Hough as Captain Cheese aboard the S.S. Muenster"". Yes ""Rock of Ages"" is a film thats completely in on the joke leading to the occasional smirk though youll beg for some new casting before the end credits roll. Youre officially motoring though Im not sure of the current price for flight. Hough plays Sherrie Christian a small-town girl looking to make it big in Los Angeles. Shes immediately mugged (and that part I can vouch for the veracity of) and then offered a job at the hottest rock club on the strip The Bourbon Room. Befriended by a boy named Drew (Diego Boneta) the two compete for who can rock the most feathery hair (Drew wins). Drew works at the bar too though he has bigger dreams of being a rock legend. So too does Sherrie who (I guess) also wants to be a singer though we basically never see her practice or yearn to perform. The whole Sherrie - Drew dynamic is troublesome never fully sold a detriment to the momentum of the plot overall. The duo duets with great frequency but its not until the end that the film figures out ""Wait we should just make fun of these two."" Once that decision is made they become more palatable but its a long and rocky ride to get there. Though Sherrie-Drew is the main plot point there are two others that the film tracks along with. We should broach those two story lines before we run out of Internet ink. Catherine Zeta-Jones is Patricia Whitmore; shes the mayors wife and she hates that rock n roll. Its her goal to shut down the entire Los Angeles rock scene And thats about it thats the whole point of her existence as a foil to music who just so happens to also sing and dance throughout. Sure okay we can go with that except for the fact that almost every scene is barely held together by music which may or may not have something to do with the preceding scene. Where great musicals like ""Moulin Rouge"" and ""Chicago"" have a storyline thats thoroughly enhanced by the music ""Rock of Ages"" is comprised of inorganic moments that simply dont fit. Theyll go from Bon Jovis ""Dead or Alive"" to Extremes ""More Than Words"" (which not for nothing isnt from the 80s) without anything resembling cohesion. Its an extended karaoke session though admittedly it features some fun mash-ups and performances. Your enjoyment of the film will come down to your enjoyment of the songs. Like an extended episode of ""Glee"" or the less- awful parts of ""Coyote Ugly"". Which brings us to the strength of ""Rock of Ages"" Thomas Cruise Mapother IV. This guy crushes every moment hes in and the shared scenes with Malin Akerman really work to where you almost forgive her for ""Watchmen."" Cruise as Stacee Jaxx is the living embodiment of a rock god. Ladies love him and fellas want to be him which given our current rock god scarcity really works. Tom Cruise is the closest thing we have to a legit ""dangerous"" rock star in his own right so his presence in the film is a huge asset. Hes generally drunk usually callous and completely self-absorbed. Its excellent. To balance him out Akerman plays a reporter from ""Rolling Stone"" named ahem Constance Sack. Shes scheduled to interview Jaxx it all goes awry and these are the moments that feel the most like a real film as their dynamic is at once hilarious and compelling. ""Rock of Ages"" is the rare film where the trailer alone probably tells you all you need to know. If you commit to just having fun with it and realize this isnt a ""musical"" in the artistic sense of the word then this wont be a bad time. Movie aficionados are the most likely to admire Cruises performance and overlook the rest. ""Rock of Ages"" is a composite of scenes loosely gathered together and branded as a whole. If youre not liking a particular moment or song? Never fear theyll be moving on to another track in a minute or two.

Then I saw if for the millionth time at the library. I was in college in 87. Though I was more into the bohemian artist Grateful Dead scene and spurned much of the 80s glam rock phenomena Ive got to admit that yes I know the words to most of the songs in Rock of Ages and that I had a ridiculously fun and camp-filled two hours singing out loud with this kind of embarrassing movie. Maverick as a Rock Star. Allowing myself to love this piece of crap movie was one of the most indulgent and ridiculous things Ive done. It was truly terrible in so many ways and I loved in despite all this. If Journey is on the radio in my car I always turn the channel. Journey not cool. Yet I belted out ""Dont Stop..."" I was powerless to stop myself. Dirksaid on Sunday December 02 2012 13609 AMerr Linda you lost all credibility when you boasted that you were a film major. I couldnt sit through this movie it was so bad. That was mainly because the protagonists were so generic and boring. From what I saw Cruise and Baldwin did well with what they were given but when the leads get so much time the ""real"" cast just cant make up for it. I agree with Roeper closer to an F. Definitely an F for whoever cast the ""leads"". Kevin Klawittersaid on Friday June 29 2012 100357 PMHeres my review. I say if youre willing to forgive the fact that the movie is basically one giant clichefest its easy to have as much fun as the actors are clearly having. kensey barlowsaid on Wednesday June 20 2012 100514 AMI can always tell within the first five minutes if a movie will be good or not. I recently walked out of for.greater glory which was horrible ten minutes in. Rock of ages nearly pushed me out the moment the first song was performed. Then I realized.. i came for Tom cruise. The singing and performances were better than what I can provide but no where near amazing. The producers should have took a hint from across the universe and west side story in making a great musical but this film is what it is. Campy in your face and loud rock and roll. Richard I cant see why you didnt appreciate toms performance as stacee jaxx. He made the film. Every moment on screen was a laugh. Alex Baldwin and Russel brand brought me in as the film made it through its half way Mark with use of comical flashbacks and their surprisingly uncovered love story. Definitely not my favorite movie it is no inception but cruise brings all you could ask for. lindasaid on Monday June 18 2012 15311 PMRichard.... you are crazy I am a film major and this film was brilliant hey guess what????? It was meant to be campy The singers were NOT supposed to be as good as the original artists Oh.... its exhausting schooling you critics.... its like we need to sit you down before the screening and say.... ""ok...we made a funny campy film poking jokes at the 80s rockers... there will be singing and choreography that is meant to make you smile and laugh and sing along. NOT wonder why they arent up for a Tony award"" jeez...so stupid and TOM CRUISE WAS BRILLIANT Reply from Richard Roeper Linda Very very funny parody. Oh wait. You werent serious were you? Best Richardromansaid on Sunday June 17 2012 120216 AMI went to see the movie and as soon as the first song (bus scene) came on my anticipation for a great rock movie was imediately deflated. I hated Mama Mia. And I hated the 20 minutes of this movie I struggled to sit through hoping it would get better. It didnt get better. Waste of time for a fan of the bands this musical emasculated. Jakesaid on Saturday June 16 2012 52146 PMYour buddy Roger Ebert liked the movie. What you thought of his review? Larry Lachmannsaid on Saturday June 16 2012 73057 AMSeems a little like Mama Mia.. but with Hairspray... (oops) POST A COMMENT indicates required fieldName Email Website YouTubeResponse URL  ?

WB I grew up listening to classic Broadway shows--to Lerner and Loewe to Rodgers and Hammerstein (and Hart) to Frank Loesser Cole Porter and Stephen Sondheim. The subsequent soundtrack of my adolescence was that last pre-grunge gasp of classic rock Foreigner and Pat Benatar and Twisted Sister and Bon Jovi. As an adult I watched Glee for dozens more episodes than any rational assessment would have allowed. My family has more than one karaoke-ready device attached to the TV--and as much as I might like to put that off on my kids they were a secondary consideration at best. Whereas the movies supporting stars are always winking at the audience its unclear whether the leads even know how to blink. All of which is to say that if laboratory technicians had spent years trying they would have been hard pressed to engineer a more perfect target audience for Rock of Ages than myself. Alas it missed even so easy a mark. Based on the 2009 Broadway jukebox musical and directed and choreographed by Adam Shankman (who also performed both duties for the 2007 version of Hairspray) Rock of Ages is a wildly uneven cinematic experience. And while there are a handful of reasons for this--the pacing is awkward and at two hours the movie is at least 15 minutes too long--its insurmountable flaw lies in the casting.At the periphery of the story stars twinkle with irony--Tom Cruise Alec Baldwin Catherine Zeta-Jones Russell Brand Paul Giamatti--and while some (Cruise Baldwin) shine more brightly than others (Zeta-Jones) all share a goofy radiance. Move to the narrative center however and we discover a black hole two lead performances by Julianne Hough and Diego Boneta so dull and heavy that they suck all the light and wit out of the film. Hough (best known as a Dancing with the Stars champion and budding country singer) plays Sherrie and Boneta (best known for his guest appearances on 90210) plays Drew. Both are young and pretty and have come to late-80s L.A. with the dream of becoming hair-band rock stars. In the meantime both work in a bar/venue called the Bourbon Room owned by Dennis Dupree (Baldwin) and managed loosely by Lonny (Brand). The place has been targeted as a den of iniquity by the Tipper-Gore-ish wife of the mayor (Zeta-Jones) and is facing foreclosure for unpaid taxes. The only thing that can save it is a sold-out show by Stacee Jaxx (Cruise) an aging and unreliable metal frontman about to launch a solo career. At its best Rock of Ages courts ridicule so openly that it is all but immune to it. Indeed the first few times the audience at my screening erupted into laughter it was hard to tell whether we were laughing with the film or at it. When an eight-year-old girl on the bus bearing Sherrie to L.A. jumps in with the last line of ""Sister Christian"" or Baldwin belts out a verse of ""Just Like Paradise"" with Shatnerian gusto is it funny in a good way or a bad one? In the end Im not sure it matters.Yet every time Hough and Boneto return to center stage--and they are again the protagonists--the infectious sense of camp and irony plunges into an earnest stupor. Whereas the movies supporting stars are always inevitably winking at the audience its unclear whether the dewy-eyed leads even know how to blink. The movie scarcely helps things by sanding away any hint of vice or imperfection from these sexless day-glo moppets. In the stage production for instance a star-struck Sherrie obtains carnal knowledge of Stacee Jaxx in the mens room; in this PG-13 retelling she is merely the subject of an innocent misunderstanding related to a spilled drink. Related Story Why You Should Wait 30 Years to See Rock of Ages So while there are rewards along the way virtually none involve the two young leads. Cruises Stacee Jaxx is a genuine pleasure a near-perfect hybrid of the immaculate self-absorption of Magnolias Frank T.J. Mackey and the committed self-parody of Tropic Thunders Les Grossman--especially when he pauses mid-rendition of ""Wanted Dead or Alive"" to solve a crossword puzzle or later engages in a tongue battle with a Rolling Stone reporter (Malin Ackerman) more muculent and horrifying than anything in Prometheus. And as much as one might like to think that as a society wed have passed the point where two men declaring their love for each other would merit a laugh Baldwin and Brands duet of ""Cant Fight This Feeling"" is proof were not there yet. But such moments are overwhelmed by the twee-ness and Glee-ness of the rest. The movie even closes with a triumphant stadium-rock version of ""Dont Stop Believin"" a song that following its appropriation by Glee ought to be retired from further pop-cultural usage for at least a decade (as Shankman who himself directed a couple of Glee episodes ought to know better than most). In the end despite its outbreaks of dippy grandeur Rock of Ages is proof that if there were ever a time to stop believin this is it.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day. Continue Reading Stephanie Loos/Reuters The Elusive Manipulative Adopted Child Tina Traster Learning how to bond with my daughter who found comfort in the familiarity of being alone has come through understanding reactive attachment disorder. My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

As Hurricane Katrina raged through New Orleans in 2005 neighborhood after neighborhood collapsed from flooding. Of the houses that stood many still had to be bulldozed due to mold within the walls. But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed. ""The Pitot house was built the old way with plaster walls"" says Steve Mouzon an architect who helped rebuild the city after the hurricane. ""When the flood came the museum moved the furniture upstairs. Afterwards they simply hosed the walls--no harm done."" The other houses werent built the old way. ""All the homes around the Pitot house were lost because they were built with drywall"" says Mouzon. Continue Reading Channel 4 The Prescience of Brass Eye 15 Years Later David Sims Chris Morriss brutal satire aired its last and most controversial episode in 2001 but its skewering of the news media feels more relevant than ever. A sex offender is thrown in the stocks presented with a small child and asked if he wants to molest him. A mob of protestors is thrown a ""dummy full of guts"" that is stomped to pieces within seconds. A radio host insists that pedophiles have ""more genes in common with crabs"" than the rest of humanity insisting ""Theres no real evidence for [that] but it is scientific fact."" Its hard to pinpoint the most cringe-inducing moment on ""Paedogeddon"" a special episode of the British TV satire Brass Eye. But 15 years after the episode aired it remains a totemic terrifying satirical vision. Few comedies since have dared to cross the boundaries of taste with such impunity. ""Paedogeddon"" aired in the U.K. in the summer of 2001 a year after the murder of a young girl had sparked national hysteria over the countrys sex-offender registry. Britains most-read newspaper led a campaign to publish the names and locations of all 110000 convicted sex offenders prompting a riot in which an angry mob ransacked the home of an ex-con. Brass Eye a parody of a 60 Minutes-like newsmagazine show had been dormant after airing one season in the UK in 1997. But it returned four years later for this surprise broadcast one that saw its furious (fictional) anchors barking from a dark studio about the plague of seemingly super-powered child molesters stalking the nation holding a funhouse mirror up to the climate of paranoia and fear that had built up around the country. It was a bold wildly insensitive piece of comedy but one that captured the growing madness of the 24-hour news media and foreshadowed some uglier aspects of its future.

"Twisted sister Rock of Ages stars Tom Cruise in bottomless chaps |       NJ.com comments Twisted sister Rock of Ages stars Tom Cruise in bottomless chaps Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on June 14 2012 at 700 AM View/Post Comments David JamesCruise plays rocker Stacee Jaxx one of many 80s tributes in the film adaptation of the Broadway musical which should please fans of hair band music. ""Dont stop believing"" the song implores us in ""Rock of Ages."" Dont stop? ""Please start"" might be a better plea to audiences filing into this hair-band 80s-set musical. On Broadway the show was a campy hit with crowds who yearned to escape into a decade of mall hair Swatches Molly Ringwald and ""Saved by the Bell"" -- not to mention wall-to-wall power ballads from guys in tiger-striped Spandex. Its different on the screen though (and not just because most movie theaters dont have continuous bar service). Because the actual locations and detailed sets somehow make this all more real. And that makes the stories and characters ... more fake. The basic plot has our heroine Sherrie Christian -- named that Im afraid just so the score can find a place for Night Rangers ""Sister Christian"" -- arriving in L.A. to pursue a career as a singer. Soon she meets fellow hopeful Drew Boley who gets her a job helping him at a fabled rock n roll bar on the Strip. But there will be romantic difficulties ahead -- including hasty conclusions career mistakes and the prowling rock star Stacee Jaxx. The films problems begin with who it cast as its leads. Julianne Hough has fresh-scrubbed looks and a lovely voice and although shes a little bland it works for her cornfed character -- but why doesnt the (re-worked) movie script find a way to let this trained dancer actually dance? Her co-star Diego Boneta is even more forgettable. A former kid star from Mexico hes still teen-crush material right down to star-shaped eyelashes. But he doesnt have the edge of ""a city boy born and raised in South Detroit"" or any obvious passion for music -- or for Hough. Which is a problem in a ""boy meets girl"" plot like this -- because if you dont care whether ""boy gets girl"" in the third act the story really has no hold on you in the second. Luckily there are a lot of other sideshows going on and a lot of supporting performers grabbing their turns in the spotlight when they can. As every one of them is livelier than Sherrie and Drew they help hold our attention for awhile and push things along. Best of all is Tom Cruise as Stacee Jaxx the preening rock star who figures as a possible rival. A dissolute musician is always a great character for actors but heres an antihero who finally isnt a Keith Richards clone; instead Jaxx is basically Axl Rose with a few more thorns an unpredictable and slightly mad star in bottomless chaps. Cruise is very good in the part and this shouldnt be a surprise. He could dance as far back as ""Risky Business"" (and still busted a move in ""Tropic Thunder"") and has become a little too adept at playing charismatic duplicitous and basically unknowable men. Jaxx is all that plus a bottle of sour mash. And there are some other fun turns too especially by musical pro Catherine Zeta-Jones as an anti-rock censor (who gets to kick up her heels in ""Hit Me With Your Best Shot"") and Russell Brand who needs no special attention to look like a decadent 80s rock fan. (Less successful are Alec Baldwin and Paul Giamatti -- and yes they sing too.) But with two vanilla leads and a deliberately corny and predictable kids-vs.-squares conflict for the story theres not much left to hang on to except the music -- and how you feel about that music all 80s FM staples from bands such as Twisted Sister Scorpions and Whitesnake is critical. If you liked them then ... well youll like them now. But if you hated them then -- and personally I was still playing my old punk records and waiting desperately for grunge to arrive -- youre not going to be any fonder of these tunes blasted through IMAX speakers. (Although I dont even think Jon Bon Jovi would mind Cruises strong cover of ""Wanted Dead or Alive."") Which is the final question you have to ask yourself Do you totally love the 80s? (And by the 80s I dont mean the years of Run-DMC ""Straight Outta Compton"" Bad Religion and Sonic Youth.) If sleeveless Ts and wine coolers are your idea of a retro party then get in your DeLorean time machine and go -- ""Rock of Ages"" awaits your devils horn salutes and Bic lighter tributes. But if youre too young too old too punk or too urban to get very excited about a new cover version of a Quarterflash song skip it. Youve always got your memories to fall back on -- and maybe even some totally awesome mixtapes of your own. Ratings note The film contains sexual situations and substance abuse.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jun. 15 2012 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Jun. 15 2012 1056AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Adam Shankman Written by Chris DArienzo Justin Theroux and Allan Loeb Starring Tom Cruise Julianne Hough and Diego Boneta Classification PG Country USA Language English Featuring a soundtrack filled with seventies and eighties hard rock songs thats like a two-hour drive listening to a Classic Rock station and some deeply silly performances by Alec Baldwin Russell Brand and Tom Cruise Rock of Ages is a film musical that can never be accused of taking itself too seriously. Where this PG-rated adaptation of a hit Broadway show adapted by Adam Shankman (Hairspray) falls down is by being far too mild for its supposedly outrageous subject. Screen grab from the online trailer for ""Rock of Ages"" Movies Rock of Ages The official trailer The year is 1987 and small town Oklahoma gal Sherrie Christian (Julianne Hough) is travelling by bus to Los Angeles to become a rock singer. After a singalong of Night Rangers Sister Christian she hits the Sunset Strip and meets cute curly-haired Drew Boley (Diego Boneta) an aspiring metal singer who gets her a job at the legendary Bourbon Room. The financially troubled club is run by middle-aged rocker Dennis Dupree (Alec Baldwin) and his technician Lonny (Russell Brand) who are facing opposition from the mayors rock-hating wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones).Without the singalong campy energy of the live musical to justify its two-hour running length Rock of Ages feels choppy the story disconnected and wispy thin. We never really attach to the tale of the callow but unengaging Sherrie and Drew. Between Julianne Houghs baby-breath vocals and Diego Bonetas puppy-eyed gazes the spirit is more High School Musical than Welcome to the Jungle.Otherwise thanks to the supporting cast its a movie of some okay comic moments but no momentum The mayors wife holds a particular animosity toward rocker and rock sex god Stacee Jaxx (Tom Cruise) whose celebrity could also save the nightclub. With his fixed glassy gaze Cruise seems less louche than loco though he initially makes an impression appearing bare buttocks first. Later when it comes to belting out songs like Jon Bon Jovis Wanted Dead or Alive he shows off credible rock-star moves and a singing voice but he generates little sexual heat. A bit more of Tim Currys Dr. Frank-N-Furter would have gone a long way here to suggest why men stare and women faint when he stumbles into a room.A shaggy Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand are amusing as they discover their mutual affection for more things than whisky and guitar solos when they duet on REO Speedwagons Cant Fight this Feeling. But the closest the film gets to genuine raunch is an erotic encounter between Stacee and a Rolling Stone journalist in which Canadian actor Malin Akerman spirals her tongue into Cruises ear. But three or four good licks do not a power ballad make and Rock of Ages is more likely to leave fans of the music hanging rather than banging their heads.

Pictures shows Malin Akerman as Constance Sack left and Tom Cruise as Stacee Jaxx in New Line Cinemas rock musical ""Rock of Ages."" Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT An adaptation of the Broadway musical about hopeful rockers on L.A.s Sunset Strip. BOTTOM LINE This bushy-tailed musical is unexpectedly stabbed in the heart by Cruise as a brooding humorless half-insane megastar. CAST Julianne Hough Diego Boneta Tom Cruise Alec Baldwin LENGTH 203 What happens when a minor role goes to a major star like Tom Cruise? It was good news for everyone in 2008 when Cruises rap-slinging Les Grossman character made ""Tropic Thunder"" a must-see and transformed the couch-jumping actor back into a likable bankable star. The hair-metal musical ""Rock of Ages"" is hoping for a repeat by top-billing Cruise as Stacee Jaxx frontman for a rock band called Arsenal. Cruise once again steals the show but this time he drives it straight off a cliff. Without Cruise ""Rock of Ages"" would have been merely a bland bright-eyed version of the winking Broadway show about L.A.s sleazy Sunset Strip during the 1980s. Mexican crooner Diego Boneta in his first major American movie and dancer-country singer Julianne Hough are pop cuties miscast as hopeful hair-swingers (everything they sing from Foreigner to Whitesnake sounds like a ""Glee"" medley) while everyone else mostly just goofs around. Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand play managers of The Bourbon Room (a Pepsi-ized version of the real Whisky a Go Go) Catherine Zeta-Jones plays an anti-rocker and Malin Akerman pretends to be a Rolling Stone reporter. Paul Giamatti as an oily rock mogul wisely tackles just one quick lyric; powerhouse Mary J. Blige as a nudie-bar owner named Justice effortlessly nukes her castmates.

Director Adam Shankman (""Hairspray"") tries to breeze through it all but Cruise as Jaxx turns a once-minor figure of fun into a malevolent fever-eyed megalomaniac who sucks up almost half the film. Singing Journeys ""Dont Stop Believin "" in an out-of-body daze and babbling like a paranoid schizophrenic (""You cant burn a fire-Phoenix"") Jaxx is ostensibly a spoof of fame-addled rock stars but he has none of the hair-swinging fun of a David Lee Roth or a Brett Michaels. Unfortunately the celebrity Jaxx most resembles is the ranting unhinged version of Cruise weve been trying to forget. PLOT An adaptation of the Broadway musical about hopeful rockers on L.A.s Sunset Strip. RATING PG-13 (language sexuality) CAST Julianne Hough Diego Boneta Tom Cruise Alec Baldwin VideoTrailer Rock of Ages LENGTH 203 advertisement | advertise on newsday PLAYING AT Area theaters BOTTOM LINE This bushy-tailed musical is unexpectedly stabbed in the heart by Cruise as a brooding humorless half-insane megastar. Back story Director says Cruise rocks Whatever doubts Adam Shankman had about tackling the all-star all-""hair-metal""-hits jukebox musical ""Rock of Ages"" disappeared the minute he sat in a theater and watched it onstage. 118 VideoChoreographer praises Tom Cruise ""The audiences reaction was nothing short of rabid"" says Shankman 47. ""That sort of enthusiasm for the music the energy and the fun -- I had to try and be a part of that."" Newsday Tweets from Newsday/newsday-staff Shankman -- who directed the big-screen version of ""Hairspray"" -- also had the daunting task of showcasing Tom Cruise Alec Baldwin and Malin Akerman as singers. He had an A-list cast but only Oscar winner Catherine Zeta-Jones (""Chicago"") and singing/dancing actress Julianne Hough (""Footloose"") were known for their musical chops. ""The person who most surprised me at the end of the day was Tom Cruise. Wed been talking about him starring as burnt-out rocker Stacee Jaxx] and building up to start the movie for a year. By the time we got there I knew that vocally he was going to be good. It wasnt until I cut his performance together that I saw how brilliant he was. Theres a little Jim Morrison in him -- this self-proclaimed poet. Stacee has this weird quiet genius about him like a lot of rock stars who only knew how to live onstage. But offstage hes a mess.

(AP) What can you say about a musical whose highlights include Tom Cruise belting out ""I Want To Know What Love Is directly into Malin Akermans butt? And a cringe-worthy Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand dueting on ""Cant Fight This Feeling before sucking each others faces? Dont say you werent warned. Adam Shankmans campy and interminable adaptation of the long-running Broadway musical ""Rock of Ages tries to do for Los Angeles notorious 1980s rock scene what the film version of ""The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas did for the sex industry rendering its seamy milieu fit for family consumption. ""Detroit Rock City it aint. PHOTOS MOVIES BASED ON BROADWAY MUSICALS Even with Cruise more or less impersonating hip-thrusting heavy-metal god Axl Rose in a padded supporting role there isnt anything approaching actual sex in this PG-13 musical much less even a reference to any mood-altering substance stronger than scotch. Theres plenty of rock though a parade of 80s rock anthems too many of them delivered by the terminally bland young leads Julianne Hough (""Burlesque) and Diego Boneta. Within minutes of landing on a well-scrubbed version of the 1987 Sunset Strip aspiring singer Sherrie Christian (Hough) is taken in hand by Drew (Boneta) an aspiring singer who gets her a job at the Bourbon Room where he works as a bartender. The aging hippie owner (Baldwin) and his aide-de-camp (Brand most of whose role seems to have ended up on the cutting-room floor) hope to save the place with a one-night stand by Cruises Stacee Jaxx a jaded sybarite making a final appearance with his long-suffering band before going solo. The major addition to the stage show is a subplot involving the wife of the secretly kinky mayor (Bryan Cranston) who wants to shut down Stacee and the Bourbon. This does provide an opportunity for Catherine Zeta-Jones as the wife to deliver the movies best number ""Hit Me With Your Best Shot. Similarly Mary J. Bilges subplot set at a family-friendly strip club where Sherrie takes refuge after a lovers tiff with Drew seems little more than an elaborate pretext for Bliges two numbers. When Cruise isnt singing into her (clothed) butt Akerman plays a Rolling Stone reporter whose interview with Jaxx consists primarily of lecturing him that hes been led astray by his oily manager (a hammy but amusing Paul Giamatti). I dont mean to suggest that ""Rock of Ages isnt lacking in cheesy charms particularly for fans of the big hair of the era (on men and women) and eyeball-gougingly ugly costumes. (Pretty much all of the women except Zeta-Jones dress like hookers.) But with a couple of exceptions I thought Shankmans staging of the numbers -- especially the leaden choreography and hackneyed locations such as the Hollywood sign -- was far sloppier and less creative than for his last musical the vastly superior ""Hairspray. When Drew joins a boy band the opportunity to have fun with that phenomenon is largely squandered . The director also fails to impose any kind of uniform tone -- Cruise in an even more narcissistic variation on the self-help guru he played in ""Magnolia in particular seems to be acting in a different movie. One reason I liked ""Rock of Ages -- this plodding mess may help put to rest Hollywoods inexplicable two-decade love affair with the awful 80s a pop- culture decade thats overdue for a break.

Starring Julianne Hough Diego Boneta Tom Cruise Alec Baldwin Russell Brand Catherine Zeta-Jones Director Adam Shankman Release Opened Jun 15 2012  Editorial Review Toe-tapper too polished to RockBy Ann HornadayFriday June 15 2012""Rock of Ages"" the hit Broadway jukebox musical set to toe-tapping 1980s power ballads and hair-band anthems takes place in the proud years of analog when bands could still be discovered in the fetid clubs along Los Angeless Sunset Strip and people bought vinyl ""records"" in places called ""stores."" The fact that this affectionately mocking homage to acts such as Journey Guns N Roses and Pat Benatar comes by way of Auto-Tuned singers such as Julianne Hough Diego Boneta and Tom Cruise makes ""Rock of Ages"" an unusually enervating experience. As over-processed as Dee Sniders hair the casts voices sweetened until theyre sticky this frenetic fitfully amusing pastiche pays homage to rocks grit sweat and authenticity. But the movie itself never deigns to traffic in such earthy pops and scratches. Rather ""Rock of Ages"" flashes its ersatz swagger and antiseptic style as confidently as Cruise wears his characters jewel-encrusted codpiece. That sartorial flourish by the way is only slightly upstaged by the butt-less chaps fur coat and sexually suggestive tattoos that Cruise dons to play Stacee Jaxx the aging rock star who pounces seductively from the shadows in ""Rock of Ages."" Like everything else in the movie Stacee is a mash-up -- in this case between the Scarlet Pimpernel and Axl Rose -- whose presence at a Sunset club called the Bourbon Room is guaranteed to bring the bar out of financial insolvency. At least thats the hope of the clubs proprietor Dennis (Alec Baldwin) who with his British factotum Lonny (Russell Brand) oversees nightly debaucheries that inevitably end in what he dreamily calls a ""sea of puke"" and dozens of upraised index and pinkie fingers amid cries of ""rock-and-roll"" Its into this maelstrom of caricatured mayhem and excess that a wide-eyed singer named Sherrie (Hough) arrives one night fresh off the bus from Oklahoma. Change the point of origin slightly and Sherries arrival in L.A. is beat-for-beat the same as Christina Aguileras character in ""Burlesque"" in which Hough had a supporting role and that along with ""Footloose"" (another Hough outing) provides the narrative structure through which ""Rock of Ages"" has been extruded. As Sherrie befriends a sweet bar back named Drew (Boneta) a bunch of censorious squares are gathering to harsh the kids rebellious vibe and shut down the Bourbon led by Catherine Zeta-Jones as a character who -- what do you know another mash-up -- dresses like Tipper Gore and dances like Michael Jackson. In fact Zeta-Joness ""Thriller"" moves -- snuck into a bizarre production number of Benatars ""Hit Me With Your Best Shot"" set in a church -- exemplify the fleeting bits of inspired lunacy that lend an otherwise turgid fatally dull exercise in overproduction momentary fizz. (Most of the others arrive by way of Baldwin and Brand as well as Cruise and Malin Ackerman whose libidinous duet of Foreigners ""I Want to Know What Love Is"" is staged with an eye toward goofy playfulness more than explicit sexuality.) Directed by Adam Shankman -- whose screen adaptation of ""Hairspray"" balanced camp and historic meaning with such bracing exuberance -- ""Rock of Ages"" gets too mired in plotty cul de sacs manufactured setbacks and numbers that are all staged as show-stoppers. In the words of the Journey song that serves as a climactic singalong it goes on and on and on and on. At one point in ""Rock of Ages"" Baldwin can be seen singing into a hairbrush a sweet celebration of that time-honored ritual of bathroom rock gawds from time immemorial. But the movie embraces that ethic to a fault getting by on borrowed gestures style and attitude and never generating a genuine sense of vitality all of its own. (Mary J. Blige delivers the films most soulful vocal performance as a worldly-wise strip-club manager who oversees a bizarrely acrobatic production number.) As much fun as it is to watch Cruise wink at his own star persona -- in a turn reminiscent of his similarly self-deprecating cameo in ""Tropic Thunder"" -- and as welcome as its wackiest moments are ""Rock of Ages"" never attains Bic-lighter-worthy transcendence. With every hair carefully in place every note tweaked and every moment cut from the same block of plastic-wrapped Hollywood cheese its content to keep toes tapping when it should be bringing the arena to its feet.Contains sexual content suggestive dancing some heavy drinking and profanity.

PicturesTone deaf Tom Cruises turn as aging rocker Stacee Jaxx in ""Rock of Ages cant save the cliche-ridden and bland musical.Sponsored LinksSet on the Sunset Strip in 1987 Rock of Ages ( 1/2 out of four PG-13 opens Friday) is a clunky karaoke/music video amalgamation that aims for camp but comes off as cheesy.Watch an early episode of Glee for a better tale of music career dreams or better yet track down 1984s This is Spinal Tap for a hilarious satire of the disillusion that kicks in when those careers hit the skids.MORE Cruise rocks in a role for the agesSTORY Alec Baldwins latest role is one for the AgesMORE Red Carpet Report Rock Hollywood premiereRock of Ages based on Chris DArienzos Broadway musical cant seem to decide on how to play its simplistic story -- straight or farcically. It ends up half-mocking half-revering the era.While the films hair-metal and power-ballad playlist may not constitute the advertised ""greatest hits of the 80s"" for all -- or even most -- rock fans the familiar songs by such bands as Journey Poison and Twisted Sister are catchy enough. But the film is flatly shot badly choreographed and brimming with bad wigs. The boring dance sequences are all the more disappointing given that director Adam Shankman-- who did a far better job adapting the Broadway version of John Waters Hairspray-- began his career as a dancer and choreographer.About the movieRock of Ages1/2 out of fourStars Julianne Hough Diego Boneta Tom Cruise Alec Baldwin Russell Brand Catherine Zeta Jones Paul Giamatti Malin Ackerman Director Adam ShankmanDistributor Warner Bros. Rating PG-13 for sexual content suggestive dancing some heavy drinking and language Running time 2 hours 3 minutes Opens Friday nationwideTom Cruise plays dissolute rock star Stacee Jaxx a man whos supposed to ooze sexy danger. Cruise preens struts around shirtless and pontificates nonsense making the whole thing feel like more of a vanity project than a film version of an exuberant Broadway musical. The bigger problem is that the story is centered on a stultifying bland romance between two striking but deadly dull dreamers. Theres Sherrie (Julianne Hough) an aspiring singer who motors in to L.A. on a Greyhound from Oklahoma (she and her fellow passengers break into Night Rangers Sister Christian to while away the hours) and Drew ( Diego Boneta) an aspiring rocker who works at Hollywoods famous Bourbon Room. We know hes rock-star material when he gets his big break nearly chokes but collects himself enough to belt out ""I wanna rock"" All is forgiven.Enjoy eight clips from Rock of AgesAlec Baldwin steals what there is of the show as the grumpy owner of the Bourbon Room (modeled on the seminal rock club the Whisky). He and assistant Lonny (Russell Brand) break into REO Speedwagons Cant Fight this Feeling in the funniest number.Ridiculously exaggerated characters were perfect for Hairspray but they stand out awkwardly amid this earnest tribute. Leading the charge to clean up the Sunset Strip is Catherine Zeta-Jones the mayors wife and a fire-breathing anti-rock matron. A musical number of respectably suited-up moms singing Pat Benatars Hit Me with Your Best Shot is stale and humorless.Hough and Boneta are solid singers but lack acting range. Paul Giamatti throws himself exuberantly into the role of Jaxxs slimy manager. Though the character remains a cipher Cruise breathes some life into the tritely familiar rock-god persona recycling elements of the more complex misogynistic character he played in 1999s Magnolia.But the tame tone-deaf story and collection of mostly forgettable 80s tunes add up to a big zero.

Image 8 of 8 Rock of Ages review Rockin the 80s forever 1 / 8 Back to Gallery Rock of Ages Musical. Directed by Adam Shankman. Starring Diego Boneta Julianne Hough and Tom Cruise. (PG-13. 123 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Some people hate metal. Def Leppard Poison all those guys in their crotch-happy spandex - hate em. The simplistic guitar riffs and caterwauling vocals - hate. The ridiculous Pomeranian hairdos - hate hate hate. But ""Rock of Ages"" based on the popular jukebox musical doesnt require anyone to love metal or even like it. It only requires us to laugh at it - and other exemplars of bloated 80s pop from Starship to Journey - and it does so with a campy and attitudinous spirit thats hard to resist. No matter how you feel about Guns N Roses Tom Cruises as a bandanna-headed Axl Rose type will hit you as the purest bit of genius in the mans entire film career. The plot is standard musical hokum. The central boring love story brings together curly-haired Drew (Diego Boneta) and flaxen-haired Sherrie (Julianne Hough) who arrives in 1987 L.A. with a suitcase full of LPs. Both are aspiring rockers who work at a dive called the Bourbon. This isnt a serious movie by any stretch Its charms stem from the juicy thrill of seeing the 80s caricatured and karaoke-fied by Hollywood A-listers making delicious willing fools of themselves. With his singeing singing range devil-headed codpiece and posture of bare-chested narcissistic defiance Cruise is a revelation - and a reminder that hes always at his best in wildly transformative character parts. And really whats more transformative than ""Pour Some Sugar on Me""? As the crummy Bourbon club owner and his quip-shooting sidekick Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand are only somewhat less revelatory They sing a duet thats bound for YouTube-tribute glory. Director Adam Shankman of ""Hairspray"" fame once again utilizes several liquid tons of atomizing aerosol beauty product. Whether Shankman can make a feature-length film with a bald cast remains to be seen but for now there is no one better for getting at the roots of a bygone era.

You cant blame him exactly. However you play up this material - as camp melodrama anthem or goof - it sags under the weight of its lightweight pretensions.Set in 1987 it features two leads of surpassing blandness Julianne Houghs Sherrie newly arrived from Tulsa Okla. to make it in Hollywood as a singer and Diego Bonetas Drew an aspiring rocker who all too fittingly ends up in a boy band. (Were supposed to think he deserves better.) What little scenery there is to steal is pilfered by Alec Baldwin as a Sunset Strip rock club owner and Tom Cruise as the strung-out rock idol Stacee Jaxx. Cruise is always at his best when hes playing against type (in this case against his own movie-star glam image). Paul Giamatti as Jaxxs sleazoid manager does his utmost to give a real performance amid all the retro ridiculousness.Warning If you have an allergic reaction to songs like ""Take Me Home Tonight"" and ""I Want to Know What Love Is"" do not venture within 10 miles of this movie.

"Movie review Rock of Ages - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesReview Rock of Ages loves rock n rollPut another dime in the jukebox baby because this bawdy boisterous ode to 80s rock is head-banging good fun much of it driven by Tom Cruise.June 14 2012|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic A triumph of genial impudence over good sense and better taste ""Rock of Ages""is the guiltiest of guilty pleasures. Blessed with unstoppable energy an undeniably bawdy sense of fun and Tom Cruise in backless leather pants it takes songs you may never have loved and turns them into a musical thats easy to enjoy. Those tunes undying anthems like Journeys ""Dont Stop Believin"" Twisted Sisters ""Were Not Gonna Take It"" and Foreigners ""I Want to Know What Love Is"" come courtesy of the 2009 musical tribute to 1980s rock that was nominated for five Tonys and is still playing on Broadway. Enthusiastically directed by ""Hairsprays"" Adam Shankman and written by play writer Chris DArienzo with help from Justin Theroux and Allan Loeb the movie ""Rock of Ages"" adds characters and tinkers with the personalities of others but the core of the enterprise remains the same. Its essential sweetness leavened by knowing winks ""Rock of Ages"" succeeds as well as it does because of its unlikely combination of a guileless thunderously clichA(c)d boy-meets-girl plot structure conveyed in a sophisticated showbiz-savvy style. The film is also filled with actors willing to dive headfirst into their roles and take the endeavors inherent foolishness seriously all with an eye toward enhancing the audiences fun. And though ""Rock of Ages"" is very much an ensemble film its success is grounded in Cruises fearless work as ultimate rock god Stacee Jaxx. Before we get to Mr. Jaxx however the young lovers must be brought on stage starting with aspiring singer Sherrie Christian (""Footlooses"" Julianne Hough). The year is 1987 and Sherrie is taking a Greyhound bus from her home in Oklahoma direct to the Sunset Strip accompanied by a single suitcase that apparently contains nothing but her LP record collection. Sherrie doesnt speak her thoughts on the bus; in the best musical tradition she sings them with the driver and other passengers joining in letting us know that this film doesnt plan to be bound by the constraints of pedestrian reality. Neither does Sherrie who is so entranced by the grungy Strip that she belts out David Lee Roths ""Just Like Paradise."" Soon enough Sherrie meets fellow squeaky-clean would-be rocker Drew Boley (the debuting Diego Boneta) who shows her where Tower Records is and gets her a job working with him at the Bourbon Room the movies pumped-up version of the Whisky a Go Go. Because its inevitably going to take the entire film for these made-for-each-other kids to work out their predictable issues ""Rock of Ages"" is happy to provide a sterling group of supporting actors to keep us entertained starting with Alec Baldwin as the owner of the Bourbon Room and Russell Brand as his trusty right-hand man. The Bourbon may be packed every night but it is losing money which is why the club approaches Stacee Jaxx to do a benefit. Enter not only Stacee but also his slimy manager (Paul Giamatti) and a fetching Rolling Stone reporter (Malin Akerman) whose tough questions get under the rockers skin. Presumably modeled on the likes of Axl Rose Steven Tyler and Jon Bon Jovi Stacee Jaxx makes women faint a literally a when he walks into a room. Heavily tattooed and heroically self-absorbed with a capuchin monkey for a pet and a devils head codpiece for his leather pants the lead singer of Arsenal oozes wicked charisma in the most wasted way and its Cruises deadpan work that makes the man so entertaining to observe. Previous roles like agent Les Grossman in ""Tropic Thunder"" have demonstrated Cruises affinity for over-the-top characterizations and no Actors Studio adept ever threw himself into a part with more zeal. Cruise even took intensive singing lessons a he apparently has a four-octave range a to effectively belt out songs like Bon Jovis""Wanted Dead or Alive"" and Def Leppards ""Pour Some Sugar on Me."" Equally committed to her role as Patricia Whitmore the God-fearing wife of the Los Angeles mayor isCatherine Zeta-Jones. Whitmore a character invented for the film is determined to reclaim the evil Strip for the citys abstemious citizens. ""Hit Me With Your Best Shot"" the dance number Whitmore and her cohorts do to the Pat Benatar song is an example of the unexpected burlesque settings ""Rock of Ages"" dreams up for its songs. Foreigners ""I Want to Know What Love Is"" is set in a wild sex scene the groups ""Waiting for a Girl Like You"" starts at a urinal and to describe whats done withREO Speedwagons ""Cant Fight This Feeling"" would ruin the fun. Fun is definitely the byword here manufactured by accomplished filmmaking all around with a special nod to the costumes of Rita Ryack and Mia Michaels choreography. Just like the song says they built this city onrock n roll and that cant be bad. kenneth.turanlatimes.com -------------------------------- Rock of Ages MPAA rating PG-13 for sexual content suggestive dancing some heavy drinking and language Running time 2 hour 3 minutes Playing In general release MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESHe still rocksJune 14 2012The Costumes Perfecting the 80s look on Rock of AgesApril 29 2012Reviving an 80s energy without getting in too deepJanuary 30 2006Teasing 80s hair bandsJanuary 22 2006MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesFilmEntertainmentBourbon RoomCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-rock-of-ages-20120615,0,5715501.story?track=rss",200,rockofages15,rockofages,latimes

At their remote cabin Jacks drunken encounter with Hannah Iris sister kicks off a revealing stretch of days. Video courtesy of IFC Films. By Joe Morgenstern June 14 2012 504 p.m. ET First it was thumbs up or thumbs down the Siskel amp; Ebert formula for reducing movies to binary categories. Now its fresh or rotten a la Rotten Tomatoes. But a sharper distinction suggested itself during a screening of ""Your Sisters Sister."" Movies are either alive or dead. The dead ones can be swirling with action seething with special effects and blessed with stupendous budgets yet never come to spontaneous life. Thats the sorry fate of more and more productions churned out by the entertainment conglomerates where demographics market share and overseas prospects crowd artistry off the lot. The alive ones can overcome almost any constraints. Lynn Sheltons lovely tale of swirling feelings was shot in a mere 12 days on a budget that must have been minuscule. A couple of minutes after its started though you know youre in the presence of people who will surprise and delight you. ENLARGE Mark Duplass Emily Blunt and Rosemarie DeWitt in Your Sisters Sister. IFC The plot is merely a set of givens that put things in motion. One year after his brother died Jack (the actor and director Mark Duplass) is bewildered bitter and existentially stuck. To get him unstuck Emily Blunts Iris the brothers ex-girlfriend and now Jacks steadfast friend sends him off for some solitary self-reflection in her familys cabin on a peaceful island in the Pacific Northwest. But Jacks solitude doesnt last long; if it did thered be no movie. Unbeknownst to Iris the cabin is occupied by her sister Hannah (Rosemarie DeWitt) who has just ended a lesbian relationship after seven years. This encounter with its sexual dissonance has a potential for comedy thats fueled by tequila and fulfilled by two terrific actors who share a gift for high-speed changes; its great fun to watch Jack and Hannah in the course of what he describes as ""barging through the doors of your privacy."" But the movie itself is a showcase of high-speed changes that begin when Iris shows up in violation of the alone time shed prescribed for Jack to find two seekers of island solitude instead of one. Soon the comedy darts and lurches into darker regions that are mapped by Ms. Shelton and her stars with brave disregard for fixed boundaries. (The dialogue naturalistic yet electric was largely improvised on the basis of an informal script and lots of notes.) Charming banter gives way to romantic yearning sibling rivalry and confused struggles with unacknowledged feelings that have ruled these three lives until now. ""Your Sisters Sister"" is a small movie I dont want to oversell it as a big event. And the remarkably tight shooting schedule which may well have heightened the drama has taken a toll on visual values not enough money thus not enough time to provide lighting setups for night interiors most of which are fairly murky. (This is a new-tech paradox. The sort of digital cameras used here can dispense with artificial light in dim environments where film would fail but lighting isnt just a matter of making things brighter; its a tool for controlling mood sculpturing faces enhancing emotion.) Still several of the best scenes take place in the semidarkness of a bedroom where Hannah and Iris sharing a bed try to understand whats happening to them and what it means for the future. Ive seldom seen such delicate control as in these conversations between two women. And Ive never seen a man vent his fury as Jack does on an innocent bicycle. Toward the end of the tale when any reasonable resolution of the trios trials seems out of reach one of them says ""Im tired of being dead and I want to come back to life."" The film pulses with life from start to finish. The Broadway musical ""Rock of Ages"" set in the 1980s hair metal scene has been turned into a feature film starring Tom Cruise Julianne Hough Alec Baldwin and Russel Brand. Watch a clip from the film. Video courtesy of New Line Cinema. Rock of Ages This insistently earnest adaptation of the Broadway musical is set in 1987 in a fantasy version of Los Angeles--specifically the Sunset Strip where vinyl still fills the bins in Tower Records. Adam Shankmans film is studded with rock hits of the period by Def Leppard REO Speedwagon Twisted Sister Foreigner and Journey among others and the time-tested standards sound fine. So do the young hopefuls who sing some of them Julianne Houghs Sherrie newly arrived from Oklahoma to pursue her Hollywood dream and Diego Bonetas Drew an incipient rock star who until stardom arrives is working as a busboy in a legendary club called the Bourbon Room. Sherrie and Drew meet and fall in love and thats fine too; their ardor is enjoyable until they like the movie as a whole outwear their welcome with an excess of glee. Whats not fine is the dead zone occupied by the monster of the piece Tom Cruises veteran rocker Stacee Jaxx. ENLARGE Tom Cruise and Paul Giamatti in Rock of Ages. Warner Bros. Pictures Mr. Cruise works hard in his roles--there was something weird as well as wondrous about the Energizer Bunny aspect of his performance in the most recent ""Mission Impossible""--and the results are sometimes excellent as in ""Born on the Fourth of July"" ""Jerry Maguire"" and in ""Magnolia"" his portrait of Frank Mackey a high-revving narcissist who preaches a misogynist gospel of the id on television. In ""Rock of Ages"" the star seems to have modeled his character on Axl Rose but this dissolute swaggerer is a cheerless clod all incipience and no payoff with one exception. Thats when Stacee and a Rolling Stone reporter named Constance Sack have at each other in a hypersexualized rendering of Foreigners ""I Want to Know What Love Is."" Constance is played by Malin Akerman whos at the top of her form in every way. Jon Hutman designed the shiny production and Bojan Bazelli did the glamorizing cinematography. The cast includes Paul Giamatti Catherine Zeta-Jones (who is wasted in a dumb subplot about cleaning up the Strip) Mary J. Blige (shes wasted too) Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand. Mr. Brand with his surfeit of warped wit might have been terrific in the Stacee Jaxx role.  For as long as Ive had this bully pulpit Ive preached the pleasures of the theatrical experience. You know the litany--movies are meant to be a social medium you havent really seen a feature film unless youve seen it on a big screen. Like many zealots however Ive lapsed into private hypocrisy. Some movies look pretty darned good--and sound good too--on the flat-panel TV in my living room. Now I want to make another confession though Id rather think of it as sharing a revelation. Watching movies on the new iPad can be a marvelous experience. First a few disclaimers Im not a shill for Apple products. If Samsung Sony or someone else had come up with a better tablet Id be singing their praises but that hasnt happened yet. Neither of the first two iPad iterations fills the bill; only the new one with what Apple calls its Retina display. (If the device were audio-only would Apple advertise Tympanic Membrane speakers?) Not every movie fits the iPad format. ""Lawrence of Arabia""? ""Gone With the Wind""? ""2001 A Space Odyssey""? A 9.7-inch screen doesnt do grandeur. But it certainly does intimacy and even intensity with stunning fidelity to the source material. These days technology spawns miracles on a weekly basis; sometimes our high-end electronics seem to be the only elements of a chaotic world that work as advertised. Still I was unprepared for the sight--and headphoned sound--of the first movie I watched on my new iPad. It was ""Singin in the Rain"" a sort of touchstone for cinephilia but also for purity of motion and richness of color. All of it was there to savor in the LED equivalent of a perfect Technicolor print on a flawless screen; the Retina display takes image quality to a new level that amounts to a difference in kind. I was back in movie heaven--not in the main auditorium but in a cozy antechamber where films of every description can be downloaded or streamed. Streaming is the real magic for me--tapping the icon for a service like Netflix or Amazon; browsing huge catalogs that mingle deathless classics with contemporary junk; then summoning up with one more tap of a commanding finger a pristine movie from the broadband ether. They arent all pristine to be sure but most of them pass my personal retina test with flying colors even if they were shot in black and white. All of this is not only eye-opening and spirit-expanding but timely. Great movies of the past are losing their theatrical homes as so-called art houses fall victim to the home-entertainment revolution. Thats equally true for some of todays most interesting films. Small independent productions foreign features and documentaries are being driven by market forces out of the multiplexes into new distribution modes online. Theres no issue of whether or when for broadband streaming. Its already an important part of the movie business. A more pertinent question is how different devices channel the stream. Big flat-panel displays are bound to get bigger and even better and theres nothing to be said against them as necessary substitutes for theatrical screens. But my new iPad has become my constant companion a small screen with outsize impact. Opening its cover to watch a good movie is like snuggling up to a good novel. If I want a social experience I can drive the freeways. Streaming Focus ENLARGE Here are three productions Ive watched recently on my iPad. Theyre available for streaming and enhanced not diminished by the tablet treatment. The Lady Eve (1941) Barbara Stanwyck is the sexiest con woman ever captured on film in the Preston Sturges comedy that Pauline Kael called ""a frivolous masterpiece."" Henry Fonda is Stanwycks mark a hapless herpetologist who happens to be fabulously rich. The opening titles look like an early Disney cartoon--the film is in black and white--and the first sequence is set in a soundstage jungle. On an ocean liner though and back in the U.S. the film remains a model of sophistication. Charles Coburn is Colonel Harrington Stanwycks card shark father. Tulpan (2008) The land shapes the lives of those who live on it in this beguilingly odd comedy set on the steppes of Kazakhstan. (The real Kazakhstan that Sacha Baron Cohens Borat doesnt come from.) Sergei Dvortsevoys film takes its title from a beauty we never get to see. Tulpans suitor Asa doesnt get to see her either she thinks his ears are too big for his head. I didnt think the iPad could do justice to the films striking images but I can still see without sneaking another peek a veterinarians faded blue motorcycle with a camel sitting in the sidecar. Ken Burns Jazz (2001) Musical history that constitutes an anatomy of the American soul. Pure pleasure in any format Ken Burnss miniseries pops out of the iPad with special power as if the music and musicians cant be contained. I could barely contain myself not only because of the rare film clips and marvelous stories--jazz giants circumscribed by Jim Crow Wynton Marsalis offering an apocryphal explanation of the silences in Count Basies piano playing--but because of the evocative photos that can be perused in crystal-clear freeze frame. A featherweight theater the tablet also works as a picture book.

Taking all that for granted and ignoring for a moment the attraction of a little wanton hedonism for a culture anxious over economic strife expanding militarism and the outbreak of HIV and theres still one overriding factor that allowed the likes of Poison Whitesnake and Twisted Sister to pack stadiums and arenas across the world Their music was just catchy as hell. To this day you can still cue up Bon Jovis ""Wanted Dead or Alive"" or Journeys ""Dont Stop Believin"" on any jukebox in America and be reasonably assured of a spontaneous singalong. Cue them up in a jukebox musical as Chris DArienzo did in his Tony-nominated Broadway hit Rock of Ages -- now adapted for the screen by director Adam Shankman -- and youve got a dramatized mix tape with ""guilty pleasure"" scrawled on the label. All the cerebral complaints you might have about the music apply equally to the film. Its silly shallow corny and polished to such a glossy sheen that its likely to slip right back out of your brain the second the credits roll. But just like the music its far more fun than it has any right being. To borrow from Poisons Bret Michaels it aint lookin for nothin but a good time and that songs inclusion in the opening scenes is the movies statement of purpose as much as that of the characters singing it. Those characters particularly the leads are as flimsy and disposable as a cardboard record-store band display. But theyre meant to be When trying to mold a plot around songs with simplistic themes the narrative sort of has to match. To that end the film opens in 1987 on a fresh-faced aspiring Midwestern singer Sherrie Christian (Julianne Hough) taking the midnight train (actually a bus) going anywhere (well L.A. with hopes of fame and fortune). Her song of course is Night Rangers ""Sister Christian"" and as the rest of the travelers join in on the anthemic ""Motoring ..."" chorus the tongue-in-cheek tone is firmly established. i Julianne Hough and Diego Boneta as small-town girl Sherrie Christian and city boy Drew who follow the typical boy-meets-girl love story in Rock of Ages. David James/Warner Brothers hide caption toggle caption David James/Warner Brothers Julianne Hough and Diego Boneta as small-town girl Sherrie Christian and city boy Drew who follow the typical boy-meets-girl love story in Rock of Ages. David James/Warner Brothers The Romeo to her Juliet the David Coverdale to her Tawny Kitaen is Drew (Diego Boneta) a barback at the Sunset Strips Bourbon Room (a stand-in for the Whiskey a Go Go); hes got rock star dreams but crippling stage fright. You know this story inside and out Boy meets girl boy loses girl amid much wrenching power balladry boy gets girl back in rousing show-stopper. The films biggest problem isnt that predictability but rather that this central romance dependent on romantic leads with all the screen presence of an actual jukebox is by far the most tedious of a number of interlocking pieces. Any time the lead couples onscreen doing anything other than singing thoughts turn to other more entertaining strands a posturing hypocritical politician (Bryan Cranston) and his Tipper Gore-clone wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) on a moral crusade to take back the Strip by shuttering the Bourbon; the efforts of the hapless pair who run it (Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand) to keep things afloat; and presiding over everything a rock demigod by the name of Stacie Jaxx (Tom Cruise) whos barely able to find his way out of a fog of scotch women and his own towering self-regard to make it to the stage and perform. When the film does succeed its in embracing its own silliness. Cruise especially channels the same scene-chewing absurdity that marked his turn in Tropic Thunder and that films writer Justin Theroux contributes much of the same irreverent winking self awareness to this adaptation. This is a spoof of 80s rock culture as much as a celebration. And for about 90 minutes Rock of Ages largely succeeds in finding that good time it was looking for. Unfortunately at just over two hours it squanders much of that goodwill by the time the story of its bland young lovers has at long last been resolved. Like many of scraggly-haired metal dudes occupying the background of the film it would benefit from a good trim.

Slideshow Rock of Ages stars and stills Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon Video Trailer Rock of Ages More about Rock of Ages >> So let us salute Tom Cruise for his work in Rock of Ages. Far more than a throwaway cameo the megastars turn as Stacee Jaxx a tattooed rock god in the heavy-metal firmament is full-on and fearless. A strutting stallion whipping his long locks across his rippling torso Jaxx takes to the stage with aplomb - and then to the dressing room with as many groupies as his roadies can muster. Whether Cruises performance is served up with irony or without however is another question. And thats a question that pops up frequently as you watch Rock of Ages - a jukebox musical thats astonishingly cornball one minute winkingly sardonic the next. Deploying an arsenal of anthemic 80s hits (""Dont Stop Believin"" ""I Want to Know What Love Is"" ""Hit Me with Your Best Shot"" and plenty more) and the hairdos that go with them Rock of Ages begins on a bus Sherrie Christian (Julianne Hough) is a wide-eyed Oklahoman determined to make it big as a singer in Hollywood. Of course no sooner has she set foot on Sunset Boulevard than shes ringed by hookers and thugs - but dont worry the denizens of the night know how to break into a song-and-dance routine too. Hough who starred in the recent remake of Footloose is ready for anything choreographer Mia Michaels throws at her - even a gymnastic pole-dance number which she gyrates her way through at a gentlemens club run by Mary J. Blige. Sherries dreams of fame arent working out and shes gone from cocktail waitress in a rock club to fending off gropers in a strip joint. Sherries love interest and fellow music-biz aspirant is Drew Boley (Diego Boneta) a scrappy chap who works for Dennis Dupree the bloodshot proprietor of the legendary Bourbon Room. Alec Baldwin - with long hair stubble and a moony look in his eyes whenever his house manager Lonny (Russell Brand) walks in - is Dupree. Theres little doubt that Baldwin and Brand are playing things for laughs - but the way these guys carry on its almost as if theyre in their own movie or a Saturday Night Live sketch. Catherine Zeta-Jones is an antirock crusader with a skeleton or two in her closet; Paul Giamatti is Jaxxs smarmy manager; and Malin Akerman is an intrepid Rolling Stone reporter determined to get the what-makes-him-tick interview out of Jaxx. That these two end up locking lips (and more) is only inevitable. Rock of Ages began life as a stage show and maybe the rock-and-roll stereotypes played better in person than they do on the big screen. But if you have a soft spot for the glam and pomp of Journey Bon Jovi Pat Benatar Twisted Sister Steve Perry and Styx there are worse ways to spend a couple of hours than with this odd assortment of courageous thespians bringin on the heartbreak and feelin the noize.

Subscribe Sign InSubscribe Movies Rock of Ages Is Sometimes Fun-Awful--But Mostly Its Just Awful Though Tom Cruise fire-breathes some life into this ripoff of 80s hair-metal rock its still a ludicrously bad Schlock of Ages By Richard Corliss June 14 2012 Share Read Later David James / Warner Bros.Julianne Hough as Sherrie Christian and Diego Boneta as Drew Boley in Rock of Ages Rock of Ages Year 2012 Director Adam Shankman Studio Warner Bros. Entertainment Actors Julianne Hough Diego Boneta Tom Cruise Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture All fear the aging rock god Stacee Jaxx. Front man for the 80s hair-metal band Arsenal he has plunged deep into the pool of his legend and hit bottom. Sporting an autobiography of body tattoos (pistols at his hips a flying bat on his upper back) Jaxx struts like a centaur with the back end cut off and admits emotional intimacy to no creature but his pet baboon. An icon and parody of the preening pop star he might be mad -- his roadie says ""He just told me to turn the radio off... the radio in his head"" -- or simply weary of inhabiting the lurid cartoon that is Stacee Jaxx. As played with an awesomely deranged intensity by Tom Cruise Stacee has the creepy-sexy pulse that might have given Rock of Ages some cinematic life. But director Adam Shankmans movie -- based on Chris DArienzos Broadway musical that was filled with 80s anthems and set in the teeming West Hollywood rock scene of the Whiskey a Go Go nightclub (here called the Bourbon) -- is so willfully bad that not even Cruises valiant CPR can help. Though it has moments where it rises to fun-awful status with a hideous giddiness that turns moviegoers into rubbernecking motorists at a crash site its mostly just awful. If the film were a Broadway-bound show it would have closed out of town. One of the minor tragedies of Broadway in the past half-century is that it almost never tapped into the pop music of the rock n roll era. For three decades from the 1920s through the 50s Broadway songs were top-of-the-charts hits; then Elvis and his kin sent radio music into the mixed-race vernacular while Broadway composers hewed to the old models or went artsy a la Stephen Sondheim. Hair the ""love-rock musical"" that spawned four top-five hits when it landed on the Great White Way in 1968 might have restored the connection but that was a fluke. Broadway musicals went the serioso route and rarely generated songs anyone under 50 would want to remember. (READ Corliss on the Encores 2001 revival of Hair) The result was that as the years passed and rock fans got old and rich enough to patronize Broadway there were few old shows to revive for them. In the 70s two musicals -- Grease and The Rocky Horror Show -- tapped the sounds of proto-rock but even these faux-oldies or foldies took decades to find a descendant (the 2002 fake-60s Hairspray). Producers found it easier simply to lift song catalogs from individual groups (ABBAs Mamma Mia The Four Seasons The Jersey Boys) or from a particular subgenre (the Sun Records sound for Million Dollar Quartet 70s-80s concert rock for Priscilla Queen of the Desert). Rock of Ages which opened on Broadway three years ago and is still running fit this trend of nostalgic appropriation. Music that once exuded the musk of danger and rebellion now provided a soothing flashback for folks in their 50s with long memories and expense accounts. Seeing the show was like returning to your high school prom without having to meet all the cool dudes whod devolved into fat cats. (READ Corliss on Mamma Mia and The Jersey Boys) Even for those too young or too old for 80s rock -- one teen I know thinks Dee Sniders band was called Hitlers Sister -- might enjoy the spectacle of Rock of Ages if the movies energy didnt seem so desperate and cynical. Shankman who directed the perky film adaptation of Hairspray and says he grew up with the Whiskey and the Tower Records store on Sunset as his twin cathedrals expends his one decent idea for visualizing the music in the first scene when the Oklahoma refugee Sherrie Christian (Julianne Hough from the recent Footloose remake) starts singing Night Rangers ""Sister Christian"" on a bus to L.A. and the other passengers join in on the chorus. The number hints at the community that rock n roll could forge in a group of strangers. After that the movie is pretty much a debacle. (READ Corliss on the Footloose remake) To Shankman the period -- 1987 -- was all bad hair and flicking tongues. Sherries predestined romance with the Bourbon employee and would-be singer Drew Bodey (Diego Boneta) serves as the plots anodyne anchor. The blond Hough who looks like a composite sketch of Hugh Hefners last eight girlfriends and the soft anonymous Boneta who could be the young Trey Parker as painted on velvet are the bland cliches around whom the movies rowdier cliches cavort. One is the Bourbons owner Dennis Dupree (Alec Baldwin in a role clearly meant for one of his lesser brothers) a hefty fellow who is first seen diving into his clubs mosh pit like a whale leaping onto a beach and crushing the vacationers. Managing to seem simultaneously angry and asleep Baldwin and his admirers can put this performance out of mind until his next stint hosting Saturday Night Live when he really must be called on to do a riff on this character and the movie -- if its not in the DVD reject bin by then. Offering proof that good actors can easily be tricked into appearing in bad movies Bryan Cranston and Catherine Zeta-Jones show up as the L.A. Mayor and his Tipper Gore-y wife whos on a crusade to clean up the Strip. Channeling the Michelle Pfeiffer role of the anti-rock prude masking her own prurience in Shankmans Hairspray Zeta-Jones belts out ""Hit Me With Your Best Shot"" in a church while making scrotum-grabbing gestures -- and while Cranston gets a vigorous sexual spanking from his aide-de-slut. (Fun fact parents this sleazy artifact is rated PG-13. The MPAA ratings board must have nodded off during the naughtier bits). (READ Corliss on Broadways Hairspray and Hollywoods) Even Cruise gets ground down in the proceedings. He has a nice scene with a Rolling Stone writer (Malin Ackerman) who -- dressed in bad-teacher mode with spectacles a frilly blouse and a skirt that ends at her panty line -- has come to interview Stacee. Then they have fellatio-miming sex while singing Foreigners ""I Want to Know What Love Is."" I dont think much about 80s rock is sacred but to assert that the love in that song is exclusively carnal is to show a criminal misunderstanding of that decades great liturgical ballad. The script credited or debited to DArienzo Justin Theroux and Allan Loeb treats hoary old movie tropes as if they were found gold -- as when Drew tells Sherrie ""I sorta started workin on somethin after we met last night"" and sings the first few lines of Journeys ""Dont Stop Believin"" (which we grant makes more sense here than it did at the end of the final Sopranos episode). And in the banter of Baldwin and Russell Brand as the Bourbons emcee Rock of Ages generously offers movie critics a plethora of lines suitable for a snarky summation. ""Did you just sigh audibly?"" Brand asks Baldwin. No Russell that was the audience. But Ill go with this comment by Baldwin as something or other has just gone amiss. ""Omigod"" he says ""I just threw up. In my pants. Out of my ass."" Thats Rock of Ages it means to be nicely dirty but leaves you feeling soiled.

"Rock of Ages (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Rock of Ages (PG-13) Overstuffed glittery musical inspired by 1980s pop rock is tone-deaf and grating. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle The Miami Herald6/14/2012 Editor rating 1 For a movie that prides itself on celebrating music Adam Shankmans Rock of Ages is oddly tone deaf. Based on the jukebox musical the film should be a guyliner-and-leather infused version of Mamma Mia -- a light-hearted production with a vague and silly plot strung together clumsily by infectious songs that demand you sing along (this time by Poison Def Leppard Journey and Whitesnake instead of ABBA). You will no doubt want to sing while watching Rock of Ages but often only to drown out the thin and unimpressive voices or to distract yourself from the long agonizing stretches during which characters attempt to speak some of the most insipid dialogue ever recorded some of it far too earnestly. If you need nothin but a good time you are going to have to look somewhere else. To be sure Mamma Mia featured some heinous singing too -- nobody has forgotten the horror of Pierce Brosnan attempting SOS -- but when you have Meryl Streep Colin Firth Julie Walters Christine Baranski and Stellan Skarsgard cavorting around the Greek isles youre bound to have a little fun. Rock of Ages struggles mightily to strike such notes of whimsy but its humor is labored. Its best asset is Russell Brand (yes that Russell Brand) as a club owners sidekick who at least seems to understand this isnt Shakespeare. Its ingenue leads (Julianne Hough and Diego Boneta) are as bland as those guys with guitars who kept winning American Idol a few years back. If these kids are rock n roll Im Sofia Vergara. Hough plays Sherrie a smalltown girl presumably living in a lonely world who takes a bus from Tulsa to Hollywood to become a star. There she meets Drew (Boneta) a bar back at the Bourbon the hottest club on the Sunset Strip. Drew aspires to rock. Dont worry if you forget; hell remind you many times. Drew gets Sherrie a job at the Bourbon whose disturbingly hairy owner (an ill-used Alec Baldwin) frets a lot about money and love blooms among pitchers of beer and choruses of Talk Dirty to Me. But evil forces in the mayors office are scheming to shut down the club and young love will soon be thwarted on the night of the big show an appearance by the legendary Stacee Jaxx (Tom Cruise) a tattooed barely coherent rock god more likely to be found under a pile of groupies than in front of a microphone. This is Spinal Tap expertly covered most of the rock-star excess gags 28 years ago but theres still plenty of room for laughs here. Apparently though no one told Cruise who plays Stacee Jaxx with unnecessary intensity; this is Rock of Ages for the love of Mick Jagger not Magnolia.  Its supposed to be a blast not a chore. But every time Cruise appears on screen the film grinds to a halt time stretches precariously before you and your mind begins to wander. Isnt it time for another number yet? Rock n roll may be self-indulgent but not this self-indulgent. Cruises musical numbers arent much better than his speaking parts unfortunately; if you never realized how unique Jon Bon Jovis wail is you will when you hear Cruise caterwauling Wanted Dead or Alive. Perhaps the producers shouldve have taken a chance on casting Brand as Stacee Jaxx; hes wiry and adept at physical comedy and at least hed have had some fun. Still the mess isnt entirely Cruises fault although he never quite gets the rock star moves down. There isnt a single well-choreographed lively or memorable musical number in the entire film; some are downright embarrassing (Cruise and Malin Akermans I Want to Know What Love Is is excruciating). What should have been a hilarious duet with Baldwin and Brand doesnt contain a single sight gag to save it. Theres a reason the best bit comes at the beginning as bus passengers sing Night Rangers Sister Christian Theyre all sitting down stationary not jumping around in front of a camera that doesnt quite know what to do with them. Ah but Sister Christian -- how good to hear that old tune again. Thats all Rock of Ages really had to do tap into the nostalgia that fuels hair metal lovers crank it up and let the good times flow. Instead it tests your patience. Guess every rose really does have its thorn.

Matt Gillmer Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Rock of Ages"" aspires to be the ""Grease"" of 80s hair metal. It ends up being ""Mamma Mia"" with a dash of ""Glee."" The result is far from a joyous classic but its a perfectly fine backward-looking trivia-centered guilty pleasure. Even if your reaction to Def Leppard and Poison is ""Thank heavens Kurt Cobain came along"" there are plenty of grins and giggles in this sweet-spirited rock n roll fairy tale. It could have begun with ""Once upon a time in 1987."" We open on a bus carrying shamelessly named ingenue Sherrie Christian (Julianne Hough) away from Nowheresville Okla. Destination the mixed-up world of pop-influenced life in L.A. where you can live the dream of your choice. She has set her starry eyes on a singing career and the thieves and streetwalkers who swarm when she steps onto the skeevy amusement park that is the Sunset Strip cant discourage her. Sherrie a blissfully naive Debbie Gibson type is firmly grounded in fantasy. She sees the world in terms of the jacked-up romanticism of Top 40 rock. In a snap (in this movie everything happens in a snap) shes waitressing at a famous music club alongside fellow rock wannabe Drew (Diego Boneta). Will they fall in love and ascend the slippery ladder of fame before the mayors prudish wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and her church ladies shut down the place? Would we have a movie if they didnt? The movie is chockablock with overqualified stars in extended self-aware cameos so many that it appears they were scooped up at a half-price sale. We get a daffy duet between rock bar owner Alec Baldwin and emcee Russell Brand whose voices would stampede cattle. Theres Paul Giamatti as a conniving manager Mary J. Blige as a kindly gentlemans club owner and above all Tom Cruise as an Axl Rose-style boozy sex god howler. David James Warner Bros. Tom Cruise in ""Rock of Ages."" Everybody gets a great turn or three before the cameras. They all propel the story in different directions and it unravels. The embarrassment of actorly riches befuddles director/choreographer Adam (""Hairspray"") Shankman who seems unsure where to point the camera. When it comes to rest on Hough and Boneta (a stage performer making his film debut) they look game but outgunned and definitely outnumbered. Even the crowd scenes feature name extras Look over there its Kevin Cronin from REO Speedwagon and Skid Rows Sebastian Bach Not being a rock critic I cant say much about Tom Cruises singing. I will observe its pretty funny to watch this well-preserved 50-year-olds ridiculous uber-masculine posturing as a love machine who would outshine Tom Jones in his prime. Wearing rock n roll eyeliner a Satans-visage codpiece and Samp;M leathers he seems to be having fun with his persona striking a pose of open self-mockery. His performance says ""We both know this is ludicrous. Just relax and enjoy the show."" Exactly the approach I recommend.

"Rock of Ages | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; rock-of-ages ) Rock of Ages (United States 2012) June 14 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli Rock of Ages based on the musical play of the same name is a celebration of 80s excess and especially music. Featuring roughly two-dozen covers of (mostly) Top 40 hits by Sytx Def Leppard REO Speedwagon Whitesnake Starship Pat Benatar Guns N Roses Twisted Sister Foreigner Bon Jovi Journey Poison and others Rock of Ages puts the music first and everything else a distant second. Its a little like watching 80s-era MTV for two hours. With actors doing their own singing (albeit electronically enhanced in some cases) theres a variable quality to the vocals but the production design and choreography are solid leading to a cheesy enjoyability. To complete the feel-good experience the ending has been changed to something significantly more upbeat. The movie is set in 1987 Los Angeles - a setting that allows the production to wallow in garish 80s dA(c)cor costumes hairstyles and general ambiance. It feels like what it is - the nostalgia-soaked remembrances of people gazing back in time 25 years (possibly through a drug-induce haze) and forgetting a lot of the ugliness that defined the ""me decade."" Having grown up in the 80s (I was 12 at the dawn of the decade and 22 when it ended) I was familiar with nearly all of the songs that form Rock of Ages backbone but a few of them dont sound nearly as good today as they did when they were first released. Watching Rock of Ages I was reminded to one degree or another of three previous features Mamma Mia Xanadu and Showgirls. The Mamma Mia association is obvious since Rock of Ages came into being as a result of the ABBA-influenced success on stage and on screen. It has the same forced structure resulting from a plot that was created to accommodate the songs rather than the other way around. The cheesiness of Xanadu is much in evidence although its more clearly intentional here than in the Olivia Newton-John misfire. Finally the narrative trajectory to the extent that there is a narrative trajectory bears a passing resemblance to that of Paul Verhoevens derided camp classic although the PG-13 rating limits what can be shown in Rock of Ages. (This is yet another movie with a stripper character who shows nothing.) Rock of Ages boasts limited star power. After Tom Cruise and Alec Baldwin theres a considerable drop-off in name recognition. Sure Paul Giamatti is a respected character actor and Catherine Zeta-Jones was once a hot commodity but neither is likely to sell tickets. The young lovers played by Julianne Hough and Diego Boneta bring little in the way of chemistry or acting to their parts. Hough is beautiful has a great body and is a tremendous dancer but her voice is nasal and whiny and its deficiencies are painfully obvious when dueting with Mary J. Blige. At least Boneta can sing; his covers vary from solid to good. But hes not going to nab a Best Actor nomination for his work here. Russell Brand manages to be minimally annoying but his presence is a sore spot and he always looks like he needs a shave and a bath (intentional I suppose). The majority of the movie transpires in Hollywoods The Bourbon Room a club famous for igniting rock band careers. The place is managed by Dennis Dupree (Alec Baldwin) who is facing a mounting tax debt and increasing pressure from a right-wing anti-rock group to close down. Fronted by the new mayor (Bryan Cranston) and his militant wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) they will do anything to shutter The Bourbon Room. Meanwhile fresh-off-the-bus Sherrie Christian (Julianne Hough) meets cute with a busboy at the Bourbon Room Drew Boley (Diego Boneta). He gets her a job as a waitress which gives her an opportunity to fall in love with Drew and meet her idol rock god Stacee Jaxx (Tom Cruise) whos coming to play a one-night farewell gig with his long-time band Arsenal. Director Adam Shankman comes to Rock of Ages from Hairspray and a couple episodes of the TV series Glee. For the most part he has his tongue planted firmly in his cheek. For example when REO Speedwagons ""Cant Fight This Feeling"" is used as the gay romantic anthem Shankman encourages Alec Baldwin and Rusell Brand to go as far over the top as possible. Later theres a bizarre juxtaposition of Starships ""We Built This City"" and Twisted Sisters ""Were Not Gonna Take It"" with the hard-core rockers singing the former and the conservative activists singing the latter. The biggest production numbers are Whitesnakes ""Here I Go Again"" (which ended Act I of the play) and Journeys ""Dont Stop Believing"" which may be best known today for closing out The Sopranos on a note of deliciously frustrating ambiguity. Tom Cruise is Rock of Ages most interesting commodity stealing freely from any number of 80s heavy metal glam rockers to create a spaced-out womanizing drug using alcohol swilling Stacee Jaxx. Cruise participates in about eight songs showing a stronger voice than one might suppose. Still the problem with Jaxx is that hes a character in search of a narrative. The plot hints at some genuinely interesting developments for Jaxx but the need to cram so many songs into a two-hour time limit means that theres no real time for more than a perfunctory character arc. Its like that for everyone in Rock of Ages. This isnt a movie; its a filmed collection of musical shorts assembled by cover bands. The only question is why this wasnt released in 3-D since its the kind of material that would fit into a format that is inherently campy. How it does in its initial run may be irrelevant; this has ""cult classic"" written all over. Rock of Ages offers its share of ephemeral pleasures especially for those who like (or at least remember) 80s music. As a means of non-participatory time travel and non-intellectual stimulation its successful. Toe-tapping and eye-rolling are equally forgivable. Rock on.

(David James) Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday June 14 2012 114 PM Title Rock of Ages Film Info With Tom Cruise Alec Baldwin Julianne Hough. Jukebox musical set in 1987. Director Adam Shankman (203). PG-13 Sexuality language. Area theaters. Like watching your companys upper-management team drunkenly cut loose at a karaoke joint ""Rock of Ages"" is an experience that will alternately leave you embarrassed and amused. Its worth the novelty but you may have a hard time looking at everyone involved the same way again. Director Adam Shankman (""Hairspray"") has kept the jokey tone of Chris DArienzos Broadway musical. But he doesnt quite know how to open it up cinematically leading to an uneven balance in which the movie both mocks and embraces its own earnestness. RELATED TOM CRUISE ROCKS OUT IN AGES RELATED HOUGHS LAP DANCE CUT FROM FILM RELATED HOW ROCK OF AGES WENT FROM BWAY TO BIG SCREEN You may have heard this one before In 1987 small-town girl Sherrie (Julianne Hough) arrives in L.A. with big dreams (and even bigger hair). She falls in love with Drew (Diego Boneta) a fellow bartender at the Bourbon Room a club on the Sunset Strip. The place is run by Dennis (Alec Baldwin) and Lonny (Russell Brand) who need an upcoming show with rock legend Stacee Jaxx (Tom Cruise) to solve their money problems. Otherwise the mayor (Bryan Cranston) and his evangelical wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) plan to shut the joint down. Also hanging around are a Rolling Stone reporter (Malin Akerman) a sleazy music manager (Paul Giamatti) and a strip-club owner (Mary J. Blige). The story of course is just a clothesline on which Shankman can hang power ballads and pop-metal hits from the era which are staged with various degrees of inventiveness. Itll be a long time before you forget Baldwin and Brand serenading each other with REO Speedwagons ""Cant Fight This Feeling"" or Cruise nailing the exquisitely solemn narcissism of Bon Jovis ""Wanted Dead or Alive."" But of course every rose has its thorn. Some of the actors have trouble keeping a straight face while nudging us in the ribs. Others seem willing to let their wigs do the work for them. Cram this much kitsch into an overlong running time and the party will eventually start to pall. The one unerring note is Jaxx a megalomaniac clearly based on Axl Rose. As hes repeatedly proven no one captures unadulterated id better than Cruise. Its tremendous fun to watch this worldwide megastar explore the basest nature of his own game - and a little poignant too. Almost 50 Cruise wont be able to play roles like this for much longer. As the actor struts and swaggers you cant help thinking If hes playing for keeps its cause he might not make it back.

(David James) As rock musicals go Rock of Ages cant go fast enough. This sloppy freak show is two minutes shy of two solid hours of screaming swill without a shred of freshness insight cleverness or coherence to be detected within a two-mile radius. Its based on a noisy Broadway jukebox joke that was never much to write home about in the first place but it still had a soupcon of humor and banal charm both of which are bewilderingly missing on the screen. The fact that the show is still running testifies to the confounding disregard for taste and intelligence rampant among todays mass-market audiences. I havent seen a movie this bad since Battlefield Earth and Howard the Duck. There is no plot but you can write the outline for the one thats missing on your fingernail. Stupid girl from Oklahoma boards a Greyhound bus for drug-addicted sex-crazed Hollywood to become a rock star and meets a janitor who also wants to be a rock star. She ends up stripping he ends up in a boy band and the story ends up in the hopper with the rest of the cliches. The two-minute story threatens to drag on for years populated by amplified wack jobs shrieking lyrics that cannot be translated and spitting dialogue so filthy it cant be repeated. The director is a fraud named Adam Shankman (Hairspray) who is so inept he has a hard time figuring out if theres any film in the camera. Hollywood blackmail comes in all sizes but I shudder to think what it took to trap otherwise respectable people like Alec Baldwin Tom Cruise Paul Giamatti and Catherine Zeta-Jones into this kind of unsalvageable garbage. Hate sets in early. Sherrie from Tulsa (rock singer Julianne Hough) boards the Greyhound and all of the other passengers burst into song including the children. Arriving in the middle of a parody of the Sunset Strip in the 1980s her suitcase full of Twisted Sister albums is immediately stolen but the prancing drug dealers and prostitutes are as cheerful and friendly as extras on The Donna Reed Show. In minutes a janitor and wannabe rock icon (singer Diego Boneta eons away from star status) lands Sherrie a job in the Bourbon Room a cross between the old Whiskey a Go-Go and the noxious Viper Room where River Phoenix took the cab. Its a hellhole run by a fat greasy cretin in a long Cher wig (Alec Baldwin) and threatened with police raids and foreclosure warnings by the new mayors wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who dedicates herself to cleaning up the crime and vice that has taken Los Angeles captive. She organizes church groups to shut down the Bourbon and destroy the career of Stacie Jaxx an alcoholic terminally stoned oversexed dope fiend played by a half-nude tattooed Tom Cruise with extended nipples black fingernail polish a pet baboon who mixes his drinks and a lot of hair below his belly button that would back in the day have caused a riot at the Hays Office. Its supposed to be a ""brave"" example of a fearless actor doing a stretch but he looks more like an androgynous addict at the New Orleans Mardi Gras who has been spending entirely too much time in the wrong kind of massage parlors. Between a barrage of unspeakable assaults on the eardrums by groups called Arsenal and Concrete Balls the mayors wife who reveals she once spent the night with Stacie Jaxx unconscious from drugs and multiple orgasms and never got over it sings ""Hit Me With Your Best Shot"" while the mayor is getting spanked by his Samp;M secretary. ""Listen up"" says Mr. Baldwin preparing his teenybopper clientele for Stacie Jaxx to turn the Bourbon Room into a Xanadu of ""sweat ear-shattering music and puke--so lets get going"" Ms. Zeta-Jones remembers the night he made her ""feel like a woman"" covered with Cool Whip and Wild Turkey. Ms. Hough tells the rock superstar ""When my hamster died your music really really helped me through."" The audience at the screening I attended was laughing so hard I missed a lot of the sub-mental dialogue but who could miss Alec Baldwin in the lowest point and most embarrassing mistake of his career bellowing ""I just vomited--in my pants. It came out of my ass."" The filthy disgusting script is by three people who should remain nameless but I can hardly believe one of them is Justin Theroux a good actor who would do the world a favor if he dropped his laptop off the top of the Chrysler Building. Mary J. Blige drops by to offer sage advice (""Its not fame and fortune you came to L.A. looking for--its love. And love left this place a long time ago"") Tom Cruise gets a reporter from Rolling Stone pregnant and ends up on the toilet floor covered in condoms. Its about as entertaining as an iron lung. I can understand the perverse temptation to make money by appealing to the base instincts of an ever-increasing audience of fools but this assault on the IQ is where people with self-respect should draw the line. Rock of Ages is so bad it makes Burlesque look like an underappreciated masterpiece. rreedobserver.com ROCK OF AGES Running Time 123 minutes Written by Justin Theroux Chris DArienzo Allan Loeb and Chris DArienzo (musical book) Directed by Adam Shankman Starring Julianne Hough Diego Boneta and Tom Cruise 0/4 Comment Filed under Alec Baldwin Drugs Julianne Hough Justin Theroux movie Movie Review Rock n Roll Russell Brand Sex Tom Cruise Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture Pussy Riot On Their Provocative Donald Trump-Inspired Art Installation Culture No Alarms No Surprises Why Buying Concert Tickets Is a Rigged System Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP",http://observer.com/2012/06/rock-of-ages-rex-reed-tom-cruise-alec-baldwin/,200,rockofages25,rockofages,com/2012/06/rock-of-ages-rex-reed-tom-cruise-alec-baldwin/

The story is willfully proudly cliched a Busby Berkeley backstage romance transplanted to a legendary rock club on the Sunset Strip in 1987. Julianne Hough and Diego Boneta barely register as the waitress and bar back acting out the boy-meets-girl plot but there are fun performances by Alec Baldwin as the clubs beleaguered owner Catherine Zeta-Jones as a Tipper Gore type who wants to shut him down Paul Giamatti as a slimy manager and especially Tom Cruise in iconic self-parody mode as the dissolute rock god Stacee Jaxx.

"Rock of Ages starring Tom Cruise and Alec Baldwin reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Rock of Ages See It for Tom Cruises Deep Dark Amazing Performance Rock of Ages See It for Tom Cruises Deep Dark Amazing Performance Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 14 2012 1234 PM Rock of Ages Tom Cruise goes to a deep dark place. By Dana Stevens Tom Cruise as Stacee Jaxx. Photograph by David James/Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. Theres something to be said for the Mamma Mia-style karaoke musical big-named performers doing their own singing (with cheerfully differing layers of skill) over a soundtrack of huge pop hits. Watching movie stars tackle the rigors of this genre is like watching them take a trapeze lesson a lot of humbling comic pratfalls and if youre lucky a few thrilling moments in the air (cf. Meryl Streeps performance in Mamma Mia which Im sorry rules). Adam Shankmans Rock of Ages based on the jukebox musical of classic rock anthems spends very little time airborne but I respect its pluck. Casting Tom Cruise as a reclusive possibly deranged 80s rock god whose pet baboon brings him Scotch may be the boldest use of the actor since Paul Thomas Anderson made him a rage-fueled motivational speaker in Magnolia. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Not that Cruises character Stacee Jaxx is onscreen that often in Rock of Ages (co-scripted by Justin Theroux Allan Loeb and Chris DArienzo who also wrote the original show). Rather Stacee is the explicitly phallic pole the rest of the storylines weave around. Hes the lead singer of a band called Arsenal that combines the aggressive machismo of hair metal with the campy theatricality of cabaret. The luxuriantly tattooed Stacee wears backless leather chaps and red light-up codpieces; women faint when he walks by and his dressing rooms come stocked with lissome groupies a gong-ringing attendant and the aforementioned trained baboon. But having reached the level of fame at which he can indulge his every bizarre whim has only made Stacee an isolated pitiable freak who naps under piles of naked supermodels mumbles garbled pseudo-profundities in the general direction of rock journalists and gazes bleakly from the balcony of his suite at the Chateau Marmont. Its 1987 and Stacees band is about to give their last-ever show at the Bourbon Room a grotty Sunset Strip rock club thats run by a crusty old hippie Dennis (Alec Baldwin curiously irresistible in shaggy Jeff Bridges mode) and his mulleted rocker sidekick Lonny (Russell Brand). The Arsenal show is all that stands between the Bourbon Room and bankruptcy but Stacees oily Machiavellian manager (Paul Giamatti) seems intent on chiseling the house out of its fair share of the take. Meanwhile the mayors prim wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) has launched a Tipper Gore-style campaign to shut down the rock clubs of the Strip with the legendarily dissolute Bourbon Room at the top of her list. Advertisement Finally in a bland romantic plot that takes up far more of the film than it ought to Sherrie (Julianne Hough) an Oklahoma ingenue come to L.A. in search of singing fame falls for fellow Bourbon Room employee and hair-band aspirant Drew (Diego Boneta) who woos her under the Hollywood sign with an acoustic version of Journeys ""Dont Stop Believin. "" (""I cant believe you just wrote that"" marvels Sherrie.) Hough and Boneta have pipes and perkiness to spare but watching them belt out ""Jukebox Hero"" to each other in an LP-filled Tower Records store feels reminiscent of an American Idol medley or an episode of Glee. Attractive young people enthusiastically covering classic rock songs is hardly a commodity in short supply these days and a little of Sherrie and Drews wholesome head banging goes a long way. (I did enjoy some of the details of the lead couples third-act slide into despair including a conversation in which they attempt to one-up each others L.A. abjection stories ""Im a stripper at the Venus Room."" ""Im in a boy band."" ""You win."") Once you accept the utter and profound inconsequentiality of Rock of Ages theres much to enjoy in it from Zeta-Jones capable hoofing (as a dramatic actress I find her deadeningly dull but the woman can dance) to Giamattis sly performance as a calculating gray-ponytailed rock impresario. (If only hed been given a solo song. I would pay a separate admission price to hear Paul Giamatti put over say a Judas Priest cover.) In the movies most endearingly loopy number Baldwin and Brand duet on REO Speedwagons ""I Cant Fight This Feeling Anymore"" whirling in slo-mo circles around the Bourbon Room back office as they acknowledge their long-suppressed mutual love. Its a moment that could never have occurred in the 1980s version of this movie (which would probably have starred Patrick Swayze as Stacee Jax) and though the scene is played for laughs theres something transportingly romantic about it--they dont call these songs ""power ballads"" for nothing. The real reason to see Rock of Ages though is Tom Cruise. He doesnt sing much and the one big onstage number hes given--shredding Def Leppards ""Pour Some Sugar on Me"" under a rain of shaken-up beer from the audience--relies heavily on postproduction and backup singing probably to mask his vocal shortcomings. But especially in his scenes with Giamatti and Malin Akerman (as a Rolling Stone critic whos the only one with the guts to call Stacee on his ersatz-Marlon Brando B.S.) Cruise goes to a deep dark almost deliberately repellent place Im not sure hes ever been before (in Magnolia maybe and in a comic mode as the profane studio head Les Grossman in Tropic Thunder). The isolation and paranoia brought on by extreme fame is something Tom Cruise clearly understands from the inside out--and what we know or think we know about the actors personal eccentricities cant help but color our understanding of Stacee as well. When Cruise and Akerman have lurid (but still PG-13) sex atop an air-hockey table while singing Foreigners ""I Want to Know What Love Is"" Cruises expressions of erotic anguish are like something out of Steve McQueens sex-addiction drama Shame with a hint of tragic drag queen thrown in. Cruises portrait of the rock star as empty-eyed nihilist doesnt really belong in this gaudy pop trinket of a movie--its both too outsized and too inward--but thats precisely what makes for its fascination. Rock of Ages is only recommended for audiences with a taste for highly processed cheese but it did leave me hopeful that the next decade may see the rise of Weird Tom Cruise.

David James This film image released by Warner Bros. Pictures shows Malin Akerman as Constance Sack left and Tom Cruise as Stacee Jaxx in New Line Cinemas rock musical ""Rock of Ages"" a Warner Bros. Pictures release. (AP Photo/Warner Bros. Pictures) Heavy-metal maestro David St. Hubbins of Spinal Tap noted that theres a fine line between stupid and clever. The jukebox musical ""Rock of Ages"" wobbles back and forth across that line like a sorority girl with a bottle of Boones Farm wine.What it doesnt do it party like a rock star. This is a refresher course in commodified rebellion for soccer moms a stuck-in-high-school musical that regurgitates the worst of 80s radio and invites us to smell it from a safe distance.To his credit campy director Adam Shankman (""Hairspray"") knows that his source material is a joke -- but its a joke at the expense of musical history. You wouldnt know it from this movie but Los Angeles in the 1980s was a cauldron of creativity and the dregs at the bottom were the Hollywood hair bands. They wore weaves and cod pieces and they paid for the privilege of showcasing their ghostwritten power ballads for record-label executives at once-great nightclubs on the Sunset Strip.Here the epicenter of a supposed revolution is the Bourbon Room where impresario Dennis Dupree (good sport Alec Baldwin) fends off creditors and the moralizing mob led by the mayors wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones). Its where fallen-from-grace rock god Stacee Jaxx (Tom Cruise) has promised to stage a comeback concert. An its where fresh-from-the-bus beauty Sherrie (Julianne Hough) meets songwriting dishwasher Drew (Diego Boneta).Given the corporate pedigree of this adapted stageplay its understandable that the lovers look like they came from a Clearasil commercial. But Shankman cuts loose with a spoof of boy bands and adds some rough texture via Cruise. He plays a pre-fab Axl Rose and is a surprisingly good singer (of irredeemably bad songs) yet even when hes prying open the legs of a Rolling Stone reporter (Malin Akerman) we never forget that the tattooed torso belongs to a real-life guy from a gated community. The only edge in the movie is represented by Russell Brand who actually lived the lifestyle but hes muzzled by a bad Liverpool accent and a gay subplot thats as insincere as the swaggering anthems by fatuous hacks like Foreigner Starship and Journey.The Bourbon Room is based on the Whiskey-A-Go-Go the fabled club on the Sunset Strip where Jim Morrison blew open the doors of perception. In the new Hollywood those doors are locked and covered with a bumper sticker that demands we dont stop believing.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Hair metal essentially functions as glam rocks lobotomized skirt-chasing meathead younger brother. This disreputable musical bastard child stole glams look and brazen attitude but drained it of ideas smarts and sexual and moral ambiguity. Now glam rock and hair metal have each received the cinematic jukebox musicals they deserved. Todd Haynes mesmerizing Velvet Goldmine used the relationship between glam icons Iggy Pop and David Bowie as a springboard to explore the heady intersection of sexuality fame and the passing of time while hair metals Reagan-era prime has been faithfully transformed into a big-budget celebrity dress-up karaoke party in the feature-film adaptation of the Broadway smash Rock Of Ages. This glossy musical from Hairspray director Adam Shankman is a shameless crowd-pleaser where cardboard characters use the most overplayed and ubiquitous hits of the 1980s to express the aching banality of their souls. Shiny-haired minx Julianne Hough of Footloose and Dancing With The Stars fame leads a star-studded cast as a small-town girl who comes to the big city armed with nothing but a big voice and even bigger dreams. At a nightclub where she toils for tough-but-fair Alec Baldwin Hough meets charisma-impaired male ingenue Diego Boneta an aspiring rocker biding his time and writing songs while awaiting his big break. Boneta and Hough fall in love over the course of a montage sequence and a production number or two only to watch their fragile bond shatter over a simple misunderstanding. Baldwin meanwhile hopes to save his struggling club by hosting the final performance of a band fronted by Tom Cruise a swaggering rock god and sex incarnate. Cruise at least seems to be enjoying himself but the filmmakers could have saved themselves a lot of money by hiring Val Kilmer simply to recreate his performance in The Doors. Rock Of Ages is pitched so big and broad it can be seen from neighboring galaxies. Playing a hot-blooded riff on Tipper Gore as a censorship-crazed man-eater Catherine Zeta-Jones sweats punches and kicks her way through her production numbers as if training for the Olympics rather than dancing. Rock Of Ages has little to offer beyond the cheap beer-buzz of nostalgia mingled with the soothing familiarity of songs everyone knows by heart regardless of whether they own the albums containing them. The simultaneously flimsy and overblown extravaganza has entirely too much faith in its soundtracks power to overcome generic characters dialogue thats funny for all the wrong reasons and a plot that could barely support a Warrant video let alone a 125-minute film. Rock Of Ages is a shockingly convincing film-length refutation of Noel Cowards famous quip from Private Lives where a character notes ""Extraordinary how potent cheap music is.""

"Rock of Ages movie review by Michael Phillips - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Rock of Ages Broadways tribute to 80s bands loses something on screen and in the starring role  Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Onstage the ABBA love letter ""Mamma Mia""made the jukebox-musical trick look easy and enjoyable. On screen less enjoyment more strain -- but people love their ABBA their Meryl Streep and their Greek islands. And the movie did the trick for those who never miss a Pierce Brosnan musical.We have the popularity of ""Mamma Mia"" to thank for a much thinner jukebox goof the tribute to 80s glam hair metal and krrrrranggg known as""Rock of Ages.""A few days after seeing a screening I was driving by a billboard for the movie and I thought well who knows? That might be fun. Then I realized Id already seen it. And forgotten it. This painless but oddly indistinct screen version of the stage show built around two dozen songs made famous by Jon Bon Jovi Foreigner Poison and others has most of its novelty wrapped up in the casting of Tom Cruise as a Dionysian rock god. Cruise makes his first appearance in buttock-liberating chaps and clothing that looks as if it came from a particularly pampered yak.The year is 1987; the place is the Bourbon Room on LAs Sunset Strip whose legendary acts and debaucheries have drawn the ire of the mayors wife and her clean-it-up minions. (Catherine Zeta-Jones plays the force of righteousness who hammers the Pat Benatar standard ""Hit Me With Your Best Shot."") With the clubs future threatened all is riding on Stacee Jaxx (Cruise) and his drawing power. While the club owner (Alec Baldwin) and his right-hand man (Russell Brand) fret young love blooms between an aspiring singer and current waitress (Julianne Hough) just off the bus from a small town and another aspiring rock artiste working at the club (Diego Boneta).Soul-sick from a life of pliable groupies and too much eyeliner Jaxx has consented to an interview with a reporter (Malin Akerman) who turns out to be The One. The numbers keep coming Bonetas character sells out by fronting a boy band and while the script for ""Rock of Ages"" by Justin Theroux Chris DArienzo and Allan Loeb is good for a few mildly salacious grins theres something off in the rhythm and the tone of director Adam Shankmans picture.Shankman had much better luck with ""Hairspray"" a rock-solid stage property (based on John Waters screenplay) that easily withstood the transfer to the movies. Here though Shankman and company are working with tissue paper. And by steering the film away from headlong satiric energy instead of toward it the director errs in investing so much ""heart"" in a show that is only about its own cliches.Cruise is certainly a sight and to the degree hes doing his own vocals (which I think he is) hes impressive. Now Is he right for the role? Is he funny? Not really and not really. This may be the most enervating yet hypercontrolled portrait of a rock icon (fictional division) ever filmed. Cruises Jaxx is all attitude and no pacing; 20 minutes of this overlong jape couldve been excised simply by cutting each of Cruises nonverbal windups or reaction shots in half. I was ready for ""Rock of Ages."" I wanted nothin but a good time. I was reasonably ready to rock. The movie full of talented performers in search of a more propulsive vehicle settles for workmanlike cover-band status which makes this a cover-band tribute to a jukebox musical -- a long way from true trashy exhilaration.mjphillipstribune.comRock of Ages -- 2 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for sexual content suggestive dancing some heavy drinking and language)Running time 203Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Entertainment Music Movies Rock of Ages (movie) Mamma Mia (movie) Russell Brand Tom Cruise Interview Diego Boneta lands Rock of Ages and a taste of U.S. stardom 10 movies to see this summer Rock of Ages Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising75deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0612-rock-of-ages-20120614,0,6619075.column",200,rockofages32,rockofages,chicagotribune

Now I understand that some may find the premise of this picture thoroughly obnoxious An odd collection of movie stars and pop icons -- from Alec Baldwin to Russell Brand and from Catherine Zeta-Jones to Mary J. Blige to the utterly uncanny Tom Cruise -- hoofing hooting and generally goofballing their way through a bunch of production numbers built around a random assortment of pop-rock hits from the 70s and 80s. I mean it is obnoxious not to mention thoroughly artificial (and hilarious). But if your objections are based on the fact that ""Rock of Ages"" seems unrealistic and phony -- that it doesnt paint an accurate picture of Los Angeles in the 1980s or rock n roll or much of anything else -- then youre seriously barking up the wrong tree.""Rock of Ages"" is an effulgent celebration of fakeness. It isnt trying to be real; its trying to be faker than any fake thing has ever been before. Compared to this fake musical set in a fake version of the past that spins a ridiculously fake narrative of pop-culture history ""Mamma Mia"" (the last jukebox musical to be vilified by critics and embraced by the public) is pretty much a mumblecore movie. ""Rock of Ages"" is so remarkably fake its almost ur-fake or meta-fake; you can watch the globs of trans fats congealing on its preternaturally bright surfaces as it cools. This movie could hardly seem more weirdly artificial if it had been jointly hatched by David Lynch and John Waters and raised in a lab on a steady diet of Foreigner hits and original Broadway-cast recordings.Im not claiming this movie is good for you Lord knows. Its a little bit like eating a Happy Meal at 430 in the morning after a long night of Jagermeister and nitrous oxide. But not to put too fine a point on it if you aint lookin for nothin but a good time why should you resist? Some people who claim to understand the public appetite smell an expensive flop here and that well may be. But Im here to tell you that this movie is almost too weird to be believed and that if you share even a fraction of my taste for perversity you should check it out.After its fashion ""Rock of Ages"" -- the screenplay is by Justin Theroux Allan Loeb and Chris DArienzo writer of the Broadway show -- is in fact true to its own tradition one thats a little difficult to describe. Lets call it the tradition of deliberately misunderstanding cultural conflict of reducing it to cliche and fantasy in order to fit it into a lets-put-on-a-show musical. You should never underestimate the power of stupid movies to give people stupid ideas but I certainly hope no one comes away from ""Rock of Ages"" with the idea that the music of Journey and Bon Jovi and Pat Benatar was ever remotely controversial or represented any kind of subculture (other than the subculture called ""people who sometimes turned on the car radio""). One thing that occurred to me while I was watching it is that ""Rock of Ages"" portrays the L.A. rock scene of 1987 with the same degree of accuracy we would have seen in an exploitative TV movie made in 1987. It bears the same relationship to reality that ""Miami Vice"" bore to Miami or to vice.I resisted ""Rock of Ages"" manfully -- for about 30 seconds. I was still OK when Oklahoma small-town girl Sherrie (Julianne Hough star of the recent ""Footloose"" remake) busts out into a rendition of Night Rangers ""Sister Christian"" during her Greyhound ride to L.A. I mean I chortled but I was OK. But then the African-American bus driver joins her in a mellow baritone and then its everybody else on the bus ""Where you goin what you lookin for/ You know those boys dont wanna play no more/ With you ..."" And I was swept away into the vertiginous vortex of irresistible idiocy. Mind you Sherrie and her overly scrubbed wannabe-rock-star paramour Drew (Diego Boneta) are nothing more than bland plot contrivances to get us from one bizarre production number to the next. Mind you they have their moments especially during the traditional second-act setback after theyve split up and moved on to new careers Sherrie as a pole dancer doing PG-13 stripper routines and medleys of ""Shadows of the Night"" and ""Harden My Heart"" under the protection of Mary J. Blige; and Drew as a member of a pseudo-hip-hop boy band called The Z-Boyeezz (""two Es two Zs and double the flava""). You Might Also Like Before they end up in those dire straits -- ha -- Drew and Sherrie work at a legendary Sunset Strip spot called the Bourbon Room presided over by the grizzled beefy Dennis (mildly underplayed by Alec Baldwin) and his skinny Cockney rocker partner Lonny (Russell Brand who of course can underplay nothing). In a turn of events thats very 2012 and not 1980s at all Dennis and Lonny gradually become aware of their upwelling tender feelings for each other a turn of events which Shankman (who also made the 2007 reboot of ""Hairspray"") simultaneously plays for laughs and as an opportunity for the audience to express its tolerance. Its one-stop shopping for all your homophobic and/or gay-friendly needs although Im not sure anyone could resist Baldwin and Brands romantic montage-duet cover of ""Cant Fight This Feeling.""Catherine Zeta-Jones whos both a trooper and a trouper plays the paradigmatic prudish villainess required of all musicals the pink-suited mayors wife whos on a morals-and-values campaign to wipe out sin on the Sunset Strip. But as we grasp during her delirious bump-and-grind rendition of ""Hit Me With Your Best Shot"" -- and who could have imagined that song could be made more vulgar? -- Zeta-Jones character has a not-very-veiled private agenda involving Stacee Jaxx the reclusive rock icon who will be playing one night only at the Bourbon Room in order to rescue Dennis and Lonny from bankruptcy. That brings us to the haunted hollow-eyed snake-slithery performance of Tom Cruise which is what blows this movie all to hell sort of in a good way and sort of not. When we first meet Stacee Jaxx hes asleep under a pile of naked groupies wearing a cowboy hat and some kind of bejeweled codpiece with tattoos of six-shooters pointing at his dong. Hes in a dressing room with an enormous hot tub a limitless supply of Scotch and a monkey whose name is ""Hey Man."" Apparently nobody told Cruise to play Stacee in the bright presentational style that characterizes the rest of this movie or possibly that isnt something he can do. In any case this is one of the greatest physical and emotional performances of his career capturing this ridiculous creature in the middle of a ridiculous situation as a figure of tremendous existential loneliness and pain. I think Alonso Duralde of The Wrap was the first to observe that Cruise may be the only person in the world who can successfully imagine what it was like to be say Axl Rose in 1987. (And I also think Alonso completely fails to appreciate the true genius of this movie.)Ive always found Cruise to be a powerful actor albeit one with severely limited range but I actually think hes gotten much better as hes gotten older and weirder. He has now ascended in fact to a realm of remoteness and strangeness that rock stars have generally abandoned -- since we really dont have rock stars anymore -- and that no movie star has occupied since the death of Marlon Brando. But the problem with Cruises performance as Stacee in ""Rock of Ages"" and especially his erotic encounter with a Rolling Stone reporter played by the wonderful Malin Akerman -- is that he calls the auto-tuned overdecorated cheeseball schmaltz of the rest of the movie into question. Stacee belongs in some other movie maybe the great film about 80s rock that Cameron Crowe has never managed to make. In this one hes like a wild thing the tragic dying spirit of rock n roll trapped in a cage made of candy. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr HAIR METAL Tom Cruise plays a petulant mega-rocker named Stacee Jaxx in Rock of Ages (David James) C Rock of Ages Genre Drama; Starring Alec Baldwin Diego Boneta Tom Cruise Julianne Hough Russell Brand Catherine Zeta-Jones; Director Adam Shankman; Release Date Wide 06/15/2012; Runtime (in minutes) 113; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted June 15 2012 -- 1200 AM EDT Rock of Ages is based on the 80s-nostalgia jukebox musical that paid campy-sincere tribute to the cheesy glories of hair metal and the movie gets the cheesy part down fast. It opens with Sherrie (Julianne Hough) a blond girl from the cornfields taking a cross-country trek to find fame and fortune in L.A. On a Greyhound bus she launches into a very pretty rendition of the irresistible Night Ranger power ballad ""Sister Christian"" and the other passengers -- all clean-cut Midwestern types -- then belt out the chorus (""Motoring Whats your price for flight?"") which is so odd it gave me hope that the movie was going to have the audacity a terrific musical needs. But as soon as Sherrie shows up on the Sunset Strip (its 1987) where she lands a job as a cocktail waitress at the Bourbon Room -- a beer-spattered metal club -- and locks glances with a cuddly headbanger named Drew (Diego Boneta) you start to realize what kind of movie Rock of Ages is going to be. Its a metal musical with a soft-rock soul clunkily shot on sets that look like sets with actors like Alec Baldwin (as the grumpy club manager) and Russell Brand (as his right-hand wastrel) in wigs that you can practically see pasted on. (It requires a certain cluelessness to take Russell Brand who probably looked like a rock star at birth and put him in a fake ebony shag that screams poseur.) This is also the sort of movie in which people flash devil horns as if they were modeling for mall T-shirts and in which the central boy-meets-girl romance is so toothless and bland it makes High School Musical look like Cabaret. Yet for all that the musical numbers in Rock of Ages... Well what I wanted to write is that the musical numbers make it all worthwhile. That theyre joyfully decadent and nostalgic fun. That they take songs like ""Any Way You Want It"" and ""Cum On Feel the Noize"" and wire you into their suburban-rebel trash-the-bedroom vibe. On stage Rock of Ages sizzled and popped. But the films director Adam Shankman who did such a great job of bringing the Broadway version of Hairspray to the big screen is a lot less sure-footed when it comes to the postures and emotions of rowdy kick-ass Americana. Most of the numbers in Rock of Ages are flatly shot and choreographed and they look as if theyd been edited together with a meat cleaver. With rare exceptions they dont channel the excitement of the music -- they stultify it. The movie like the show presents itself as a kind of Footloose of the Sunset Strip. Its about the moment when metal within the club scene of L.A. had begun to cohabit with the slinky fleshpot narcissism of the sex industry -- an unholy communion of tattoos and torn fishnets. The plot turns on the attempt of the mayor (Bryan Cranston) and his uptight wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) to lead the local church types in a crusade to shut down the Bourbon Room and the sleaze-versus-the-squares thing is pretty old hat even when delivered as 80s kitsch. Yet it might have worked had say the church ladies been given a good number. Instead they sing ""Hit Me With Your Best Shot"" (but why?) with fist-locomotion moves copped from the ""Beat It"" video (but why?) all of it so robotic and chopped up that Zeta-Jones sexy puritan leading this by-the-rules brigade registers less as a dancing force than as an insane person. Sherrie becomes a stripper Drew becomes a boy-band sellout and none of it has any weight. In the end however there is a reason to see Rock of Ages and thats Tom Cruises funny louche performance as Stacee Jaxx the films jaded and dissolute Axl Rose metal-god figure. Cruise holding his pistol-tattooed zero-body-fat flesh at a drunken 45-degree angle has the look and the poses down flat but he also gives Stacee a haunted underside. He has seen the dark side of fame and its written all over his face but hes not going to open up about it -- not even to the Rolling Stone reporter (Malin Akerman) he seduces and then falls for. I wish that these two didnt have to do a striptease as they duet on the ultraromantic ""I Want to Know What Love Is."" (Talk about an off-key concept) But Cruise who can truly sing does a rendition of ""Wanted Dead or Alive"" that rocks it and finds the deep soul of it. At that moment you can glimpse the movie that Rock of Ages should have been. C Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

"Review Rock of Ages never rocks - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Rock of Ages never rocksBy Karen DSouzaSan Jose Mercury NewsPosted 06/13/2012 100000 AM PDTUpdated 06/13/2012 033701 PM PDTAnyway you want it thats the way you need it.If you remember the days of wine coolers and leg warmers with a nostalgia that borders on the Proustian you might be amped for the ""Rock of Ages"" movie this summer. But be forewarned my fellow kitsch mavens Adam Shankmans grody adaptation of the campy 2006 musical will not rock you like a hurricane. Despite a jukebox full of hair-metal anthems and a few memorable performances ""Rock of Ages"" is a bloated big-budget spectacle that makes you long to drown your sorrows in a six-pack of Bartles and Jaymes (do they still make those?).Certainly the genius of the face-melting Broadway musical one of the guiltiest pleasures ever was how vigorously it spoofed itself mocking everything from acid-wash to jazz hands in a spit-up funny 80s singalong that left no shtick unturned.Unfortunately Shankmans movie takes itself so deadly seriously that it drains all of the cheesy fun from the age of come-on-feel-the-noise. Despite the fact that playwright Chris DArienzo helped write the script the painfully literal flick misses the mark in terms of snark. Even potshots at aerobics and Bennetton get lost in the movies irony-free zone. ""Rock of Ages"" has no sense of humor which is odd given the subject matter. Choppy editing tepid pacing and generic vocals are bad enough to rival ""Grease 2.""Advertisement Shankman who also helmed the film version of ""Hairspray"" goes for ham-handed and sappy instead of lighthearted. Its as if the movie were trying to channel ""Glee"" instead of gnarly. That kind of saccharine overemoting is fatal when the plot is just a feeble excuse for covers of every 80s headbanger from Def Leppard Journey Foreigner Bon Jovi Night Ranger and REO Speedwagon.Sherrie (a fresh-faced Julianne Hough) is just a small-town girl living in a lonely world circa 1987. She takes the bus from Tulsa Okla. to Tinseltown where she lands a job at a Hollywood watering hole a mecca of big hair and small miniskirts. There she meets little boy lost Drew (the hottie Diego Boneta) a wannabe rock star toiling as a barback.The original musical was so tongue-in-cheek that it left you feeling totally awesome for being in on the joke. Here all of the dialogue is played so cringingly straight that its a relief when someone breaks into song. Not for long but still. The starry-eyed lovers are so bland and vapid they make Disneys ""High School Musical"" look gritty. It should be tragic when Sherrie is reduced to stripping and Drew ends up in a boy band but since theres more character in their costumes than their performances it hardly matters.Indeed Hough and Bonetas sugary singing seems better suited to pop than rock. They never capture the lust and sweat of the mosh pit. The power ballads are gag-worthy. It only makes matters worse that Constantine Maroulis who was indelible as Drew onstage has a tiny cameo here. Hes a reminder of what the movie is so palpably missing the raw and unruly hunger that drives someone to bare their soul in the spotlight.To be fair the movie boasts Tom Cruise in perhaps his best performance since ""Interview with the Vampire."" The megastar slithers around as rock god Stacee Jaxx bedding a string of groupies while sporting a bejeweled codpiece a half-naked entourage and a pet monkey.Cruise is so over the top hes upside down. He oozes sex and booze tapping into a magnetism you may have forgotten he had especially in the ""Dead or Alive"" number. He single-handedly rescues the movie from its doldrums time and again.Unfortunately hes so perversely charismatic in the role that the director lets him steal the show. Jaxx becomes the main course when his Axl Rose homage would be tastier as a side dish. For the record there are juicy little turns by Alec Baldwin as the has-been club manager and Russell Brand (riffing on his ""Get Me to the Greek"" vibe) as his party-hardy sidekick. They sing their hearts out in a surprisingly moving ""Cant Fight This Feeling."" Mary J. Blige also vamps up a storm to ""Shadows of the Night"" and ""Harden My Heart.""Alas Bryan Cranston is simply wasted as the Samp;M-dabbling mayor whose religious zealot wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) tries to outlaw rock n roll and Paul Giamatti is woefully underused as Jaxxs oily manager. All three actors are capable of getting down and dirty but even the sex scenes here seems curiously fresh-scrubbed. Lets not even get into the awkward choreography in Zeta-Jones big ""Hit Me With Your Best Shot"" number.The bottom line is that even if you know all the words to the Journey songbook its hard to not stop believin in this uninspired mashup. Oh the movie never ends it goes on and on and on.Contact Karen DSouza at 408-271-3772.

Rock of Ages Bad to fair Director Adam Shankman. Cast Julianne Hough Diego Boneta Tom Cruise. Rating PG-13 for sexual content suggestive dancing some heavy drinking and language. Geez. How come no one makes movies about Lets Active or the dBs? 10 music movies that rock Interview Tom Cruise Be that as it may in fairness the songs used in the film -- hits from the likes of Journey Foreigner Poison Twisted Sister and Whitesnake -- are more enjoyable in the cover versions here than they were on the radio at the time and director Adam Shankman seems to know this and have fun with it; certainly his cast does. And he gets enormously entertaining performances from Tom Cruise and Alec Baldwin so much so that its a problem The movies not about them. Its about Sherrie Christian (Julianne Hough) and Drew Boley (Diego Boneta) ""just a small-town girl livin in a lonely world...."" Hmm. You see the effect these songs have. Anyway the movie is set in 1987 when Sherrie an aspiring singer boards a bus from her hometown in Oklahoma for LA. Of course the bus breaks into ""Sister Christian."" This is a musical after all (based on Chris DArienzos Broadway show). Sherrie meets Drew and they instantly fall for each other; he even gets her a job at the club where he works the Bourbon Room on the Sunset Strip. Like Sherrie Drew wants to be a singer but neither has much in the way of prospects. The club is owned by Dennis Dupree (Baldwin) an old-time rocker with tax problems. He needs a big show and it looks like hes going to get one Arsenal a band fronted by the astoundingly dissolute singer Stacee Jaxx (Cruise) has agreed to play its final show at the Bourbon Room before Jaxx embarks on his solo career -- at least if the bands weasel of a manager (Paul Giamatti) comes through on the promise. There are other obstacles. Newly elected Mayor Mike Whitmore (Bryan Cranston) and his wife Patricia (Catherine Zeta-Jones) are determined to clean up the Strip; Patricia has it out for Jaxx in particular. Her moral indignation leads to a clunky song-and-dance number from Zeta-Jones set to Pat Benatars ""Hit Me With Your Best Shot"" while the mayor attends to um other business with a staff member in a nearby office. A Rolling Stone reporter (Malin Akerman) manages to get to Jaxx; their duet to ""I Want to Know What Love Is"" takes things further than the usual journalist-source relationship. Its pretty funny and Cruise is really good both in the role and with his singing. But here again were talking about songs like ""I Want to Know What Love Is."" Not to be a college-radio snob or anything but ... well yes. Be a college-radio snob. Be a good-music snob. Among the albums released in 1987 ""The Joshua Tree"" ""Sign O the Times"" ""Sister"" ""Youre Living All Over Me"" ""Document"" ""Pleased to Meet Me"" ""The Lion and the Cobra"" ""Yo Bum Rush the Show"" and ""Tunnel of Love."" Not a bad haul. Yet someone somewhere was rocking out to ""Wanted Dead or Alive"" by Bon Jovi. Actually a lot of people in a lot of places were. And of course thats why Cruise is belting it out here. Putting the music aside the bigger problem is that Hough and Boneta for all the enthusiasm they bring to their characters just arent all that interesting. The film is much more intriguing when Cruise is on-screen or Baldwin or Russell Brand as the Bourbon Clubs technician. They in short rock. Someone ought to. Rock musics liberating spirit is supposed to be at the center of the movie but the characters on its edges are the only one who embody it. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Within minutes of stepping off the bus she meets bartender-cum-aspiring-musician Drew Boley (Diego Boneta) who gets her a waitressing job at the Bourbon Room a rock-music haven likely on its last legs. Romance blossoms--in a Tower Records no less where the hot-to-trot duo belts out a mash-up medley of ""Juke Box Hero"" and ""I Love Rock n Roll."" But admit it Youre not coming to Adam Shankmans peppy screen adaptation of the popular Broadway jukebox musical for the vapid fresh faces. (As singing lovers go these two are less Nancy Spungen and Sid Vicious than one of those insipid warbling duos who sapped the energy out of many a Marx Brothers movie.) Youre here to see a bunch of game A-listers play celebrity karaoke with the 80s glam-band tunes of Def Leppard Journey Twisted Sister and others. On that front this spiritedly superficial movie delivers more often than not as the wispy plot--revolving around a save-the-venue performance by satanic rocker Stacee Jaxx (Tom Cruise)--allows for a series of headbanging set pieces. Moralistic mayors wife Patricia Whitmore (Catherine Zeta-Jones) kicks it to Pat Benatars ""Hit Me with Your Best Shot""; Bourbon Room owners Dennis (Alec Baldwin) and Lonny (Russell Brand) do a hilarious romantic duet to REO Speedwagons ""Cant Fight This Feeling""; and a creepily in-character Cruise comes damn close to actual pathos with his longing cover of Foreigners ""I Want to Know What Love Is."" Fans of Moulin Rouge-esque repurposing will be in hog heaven. Everyone else will want to hop that midnight train going anywhere pronto.

Pictures A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Rock of Ages a new star-clogged pop-musical diversion is a cinematic event. Its not every day after all that you get to see two great American traditions--guitar/bass/drums rock music and Tin Pan Alley musical theater--so thoroughly mutually degraded.This mess originated as a stage production first performed in Los Angeles in 2006 from which it spread to Broadway the West End and the known universe beyond. Like Mamma Mia or Jersey Boys it belongs to the species that has been dubbed the ""jukebox musical"" in which a group of licensed pop songs are strung together to create a ready-made musical score. This practice of steering a story between preexistent tunes effectively guarantees that the songs cannot grow from the plot organically while challenging the author of the book to invent the pretext of a narrative setting in which to imbed the numbers.In the case of Rock of Ages the foundations that a story must be built upon are an afternoon of VH1 Classics worth of 1980s hair metal. The original author of the stage show Chris DArienzo is joined for the screenplay by Justin Theroux and Allan Loeb and they have together drafted something that combines elements of Menahem Golans The Apple Empire Records the Guns N Roses video for ""Welcome to the Jungle"" and Tipper Gores 80s career as politicians wife and PMRC scold.Film Details Rock of Ages RatingPG-13 GenreDrama Running Time123 More Info Trailer Its West Hollywood 1987 and a bus pulls up to a corner to disgorge . . . not Axl Rose with the hayseeds straw sticking out of his mouth but Dancing With the Stars mainstay Julianne Hough here playing Sherrie a girl from Tulsa dreaming of the big time as a frontwoman. Instead she gets her suitcase stolen and ends up waiting tables at the Bourbon Room thanks to the intervention of young Drew (Diego Boneta) who we know is destined for Sherrie as he shares her scruffily clean-cut looks her wide-eyed Jukebox Hero aspirations and is like her staggeringly dull.Even this safe haven is not however safe. ""Taxes theyre so un-rock n roll"" Bourbon owner Dennis (Alec Baldwin) sighs faced with a money-crunch deadline as the mayors Tipper-esque anti-rock crusader wife Patricia Whitmore (Catherine Zeta-Jones) scrutinizes the Bourbons fudged books looking for any excuse to shut the place down as part of her ""Clean Up the Strip"" initiative. Denniss Hail Mary solution is corralling back Stacee Jaxx (Tom Cruise) former Bourbon mainstay turned decadent dissipated and totally unreliable arena rocker for a one-off benefit show.Cruise has the advantage of playing one of those built-up parts like Hickey in The Iceman Cometh or Harry Lime. Everyone in the first act talks up Stacee Jaxx so he cant help but be impressive by the time he shows up--a fine fit for a star who by now can only really be convincing as a star. The dissolute rock-god gags (pet monkey scrums of groupies) are old hat but Cruise is a dynamic kabuki-esque full-body performer and he gives Jaxx something between the boozy silverback swagger of Jim Morrison and Glenn Danzigs armored-car physical presence.Jaxx finds his match in Malin Akermans Rolling Stone reporter who calls out Jaxxs coasting career under Paul Gill (Paul Giamatti) his manager--that most conveniently villainized of rock-historical figures scapegoated so that personal accountability can never be demanded of our heroes. Gill says things like ""We did a whole focus group on this--numbers dont lie"" and will later get his hooks into rising star Drew drafting him in a New Jack Swing-style boyband. This is presented as the epitome of sellout which only makes sense if you are willing to accept the premise that there was more artistic integrity in being a member of say Poison than in being in New Kids on the Block. Like much in Rock of Ages it also carries a faint whiff of unexamined racism.Choreographer-cum-director Adam Shankman who previously handled 2007s Hairspray does his best to keep things assaultively lively hot-potatoing songs around the cast and crosscutting in Frankensteined mash-ups. The songs in Rock of Ages split pretty evenly between power balladry (""More Than Words"") and anthemic fist-pumpers (""Pour Some Sugar on Me"").There are two basic ways of thinking about this music; which one youre inclined toward will probably influence your enjoyment of Rock of Ages. One is fond nostalgia--this was innocently hedonistic good-time party music with hooks big enough to land Moby Dick. ""Goddamn they dont make em like they used to"" said Mickey Rourkes Randy ""The Ram"" in The Wrestler when Def Leppard comes on in a bar. ""Then that Cobain pussy had to come around and ruin it all.""The other--which I happen to believe--is that that Cobain pussy did everyone a great favor because hair metal was bone stupid creatively bankrupt morally debased pop trash that marked an all-time low in record-label-chart manipulation and synthetic hit-making hackery. And if rock as is herein insisted will never die the ""rock"" paradigm perpetuated by Rock of Ages--the same as in Rockstar energy drink and Nickelbacks ""Rockstar""--deserves a deep dank unmarked grave.

Blige Busts Out the Journey in Rock of Ages Clip (Video) By the time Debbie Gibson and Sebastian Bach are standing shoulder to shoulder belting out Starships ""We Built This City"" without a smidge of irony one begins to wonder it ""Rock of Ages"" even gets its own joke When club owner Dennis (Alec Baldwin) gives busboy Drew (Diego Boneta) the big break of opening for rock legend Stacee Jaxx (Tom Cruise) he tells the newbie ""Three songs. No covers."" By the end of ""Rock of Ages"" -- at which the point the audience has been subjected to two hours of Reagan-era pop hits recorded in a way that makes Kidz Bop sound like ""Glee"" and ""Glee"" sound like GWAR -- the idea of a mere trio of original tunes sounds like a slice of heaven. In its transition from an intimate and partially tongue-in-cheek L.A. theater piece to Broadway show to bloated all-star cinematic extravaganza ""Rock of Ages"" has traded in whatever sense of humor it might have once had about itself and its roster of melodramatic power ballads (they might as well have called it ""Stadium Rock of Ages"") for an overblown aimlessness. Watch video Rock of Ages Trailer Is All About Tom Cruise By the time Debbie Gibson and Skid Rows Sebastian Bach are standing shoulder to shoulder and belting out Starships ""We Built This City"" without a smidge of irony one begins to wonder it ""Rock of Ages"" even gets its own joke. The plot which feels cobbled together from stray bits of ""Burlesque"" and ""The Apple"" revolves around Oklahoma gal Sherrie Christian (Julianne Hough) who comes to Los Angeles in 1987 to pursue her rock-and-roll dreams. Within her first hour in town she gets mugged and she meets Drew who gets her a job at Sunset Strip rock palace the Bourbon Room run by Dennis and manager Lonny (Russell Brand). Despite the clubs legendary status the place is on the verge of bankruptcy a situation that can be avoided with an appearance by the legendary Axl Rose-like Stacee whos so out of it that he arrives on time only when his oily manager Paul (Paul Giamatti) tells him the gig was actually set for the night before. But Patricia Whitmore (Catherine Zeta-Jones) the wife of L.A.s new mayor (Bryan Cranston) has focused on Stacee as part of her campaign to save the Sunset Strip from the devils music once and for all. Watch video Mary J. Blige Busts Out the Journey in Rock of Ages Clip Oh that something Satanic might actually have crawled into ""Rock of Ages"" at some point. When Tipper Gore formed the Parents Music Resource Center she wasnt gunning for Quarterflash and REO Speedwagon just two of the white-bread bands whose songs are featured here. Its akin to making a movie about people trying to suppress gangsta rap and then filling the soundtrack with cuts by PM Dawn and DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince. Whether you have fond memories of songs like ""I Want to Know What Love Is"" and ""Every Rose Has Its Thorn"" or youre inclined to change stations when they pop up on the radio the karaoke versions offered up by ""Rock of Ages"" are ear-punishers. The films thudding literalism doesnt help either; when someone sings about standing on a corner in the rain/""gt;rain you can just bet that theyll be singing that line on a corner. In the rain/""gt;rain. Even when the movie unleashes a real singer like Mary J. Blige her powerhouse voice gets mostly swallowed up by the bland back-up chorus and the stultifying orchestrations that bludgeon everything into a patina of silky-smooth nothing. ""Rock of Ages"" takes place in the final days when bands like Foreigner and Def Leppard could still dominate the charts. (Apart from one passing reference to rap the ascendance of hip-hop is invisible here.) Its a movie that passes off mainstream pop as being somehow dangerous reaching its crescendo at the end when after rejecting a New Kids-ish boy band ""Rock of Ages"" delivers its thunderous climax with ... Journeys ""Dont Stop Believin"" a song thats been so castrated by pop culture that its a grade-school sing-along. As for the acting its a very mixed bag that mostly disappoints. Houghs charms were enough to get her through the ""Footloose"" remake even if she was no challenge to Lori Singer but here shes just vapid and unengaging as is her co-star Boneta. Baldwin and Zeta-Jones overplay with the gusto of Royal Shakespeare actors doing Christmastime panto while Malin Akerman (as a Rolling Stone reporter) and Giamatti find some of the films few comic notes. Brand naturally gets the dissipation and the head-banging just right. Tom Cruise -- who to his credit is probably one of the few people on earth who can imagine first-hand what it was like to be Axl Rose in 1987 -- plays it unapologetically weird and eccentric but he plays the same note of weird and eccentric throughout. Once his Stacee Jaxx gets onstage though Cruises charisma bleeds over into the music world making the actor look completely believable as a Dionysus with a Marshall stack. The only jolts of actual rock-and-roll danger in ""Rock of Ages"" come from Cruise and from Mickey the primate who steals his scenes as Stacees mandrill sidekick. The rest of it is a dreary costume party packed with people you wish would just stop singing already. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

"Rock of Ages | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Review Rock of Ages Justin Chang Chief Film Critic JustinCChang 0 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr June 10 2012 | 0500PM PT ""Rock of Ages "" is a jukebox tuner that knows the licks and lyrics but not the music. A soundtrack stuffed with 80s chart-toppers a gleefully self-mocking turn from Tom Cruise and a whole lot of gnarly hairdos arent enough to recommend the bigscreen version of ""Rock of Ages"" a jukebox tuner that knows the licks and lyrics but not the music. Absent the infectious live-audience energy of Chris DArienzos legit hit this affectionate glam-rock-a-thon reps a visually bland staging of frankly insipid material never tapping into the raucous go-for-broke energy that would spin the shows cliches into gold let alone platinum. Warners release will thrash out a decent opening but wont crowd-surf for long. Given the proliferation of high-school musicals and American idols on TV the spectacle of aspiring young singers belting out an umpteenth cover of Journey offers little in the way of novelty value. In years to come this proud tribute to hair metals heyday may be remembered as a creaky cultural relic born of not only Hollywoods ongoing search for Broadway-based hits but also the 80s nostalgia craze that spawned such recent items as ""Take Me Home Tonight"" and the remake of ""Footloose"" (whose female lead Julianne Hough also toplines here). In transferring ""Rock of Ages"" to the bigscreen scenarists DArienzo Justin Theroux and Allan Loeb have largely retained the shows two-dozen-plus hard-rock and heavy-metal hits barely held together by a love story that unfolds under the bright lights of the Sunset Strip. That formula worked well enough onstage buoyed by a live rock-concert atmosphere and ample doses of self-reflexive humor. Onscreen as directed by Adam Shankman (""Hairspray"") everything seems less tongue-in-cheek and more earnestly one-dimensional. The romance feels drippier the numbers choppier; one can sense the energy being desperately expended in hopes of getting viewers to fist-pump in the aisles. Yet no matter how often the setlist urges you to dont stop believin and cum on feel the noize any such impulses are deflated by the reality of whats onscreen lip-synched performances and musicvideo-ready poses sliced and diced in a whirlwind of power chords and flailing camerawork. Neither a satisfying drama nor a vivid mosh-pit immersion the pic plays like a series of karaoke videos produced at great expense much of it spent on hair products. Its 1987 when cute sweet Midwestern gal Sherrie Christian (Hough) arrives in Los Angeles with her sights set on a singing career. She soon meets and falls for Drew Boley (Diego Boneta) an equally cute sweet aspiring rocker who gets her a job at the Bourbon Room a legendary rock club run by the world-weary Dennis Dupree (Alec Baldwin) and his party-hearty technician Lonny (Russell Brand). Though this dives seen better days its jammed with enough sweaty drunken revelers every night to live up to its promise of ""Nothin but a Good Time."" A good time alas is precisely what the mayors wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) hopes to quash in yet another stale ""Footloose""-style movie subplot skewering conservative moral gatekeepers. Backed by a chorus of church ladies in pleated skirts as she urges her enemies to ""Hit Me With Your Best Shot"" Zeta-Jones political banshee declares war on the Bourbon Room and its headline-grabbing latest act Stacee Jax (Cruise). Whatever ones reservations up to this point theres no doubting the impact of this Dionysian rock idols arrival on the scene. Accompanied at all times by a pet monkey a sleazy manager (Paul Giamatti) and various half-naked women Stacee makes a decidedly um cheeky first appearance in leather chaps and satanic crotchwear giving off a palpable whiff of sex and booze. Channeling the likes of Axl Rose and Keith Richards with his tattoos heavy furs and even heavier eyeshadow Cruise clearly relishes the opportunity to play against type even as he sends up his worlds-biggest-movie-star identity displaying a cock-of-the-rock strut that viewers havent seen since his turn in ""Magnolia."" And whether hes turning Jon Bon Jovis ""Wanted Dead or Alive"" into a rebel yell or ordering his fans to ""Pour Some Sugar on Me"" the thesp socks over his singing duties with aplomb. The entire ensemble is in fine musical form Zeta-Jones still has the singing and hoofing chops she showed in ""Chicago"" and Mary J. Blige adds a touch of class as a strip-club den mother who takes Sherrie under wing when fate starts bringin on the heartbreak. As for the vocally adept young leads Hough imbues her small-town girl with a winsome pluck; less engaging is Boneta whose puppy-dog affect unfortunately makes Drews third-act descent into boy-band hell feel all too fitting. Though crammed with the racy lyrics and suggestive dance moves endemic to its milieu the PG-13 pic feels awkwardly stranded between naughty and nice any time it broaches the subject of sex. When Stacee and a probing Rolling Stone journalist (Malin Akerman) do a dirty duet on Foreigners ""I Want to Know What Love Is"" their hot-and-heavy pantomime flirts with outrage but seems unwilling to go all the way. The indecision is typical of the movies identity crisis; its a rock musical thats finally afraid to let its hair down. Overall ""Rock of Ages"" could use less ""Glee"" and more grunge which is less a knock on Jon Hutmans pungent production design and Rita Ryacks terrific costumes than on the materials squeaky-clean sensibility. Further undermining the aural adrenaline volume levels seemed curiously low at the screening reviewed.

Pictures The Poison hit featured on the soundtrack promises ""Nothin but a Good Time."" If only. TWITTER Julianne Hough and Diego Boneta play the small-town girl and city boy in this tribute to 80s hair metal and the L.A. rock scene with Tom Cruise Alec Baldwin Russell Brand Catherine Zeta-Jones Paul Giamatti and Mary J. Blige. NEW YORK - Basically a Mamma Mia with 80s hair metal in place of ABBA Rock of Ages is a jukebox musical wrapped in vinyl nostalgia that has been playing to modest but steady business on Broadway for the past three years. However the headbanger party owes some of its notoriety to Poison frontman Bret Michaels getting accidentally brained during a production number from the show at the 2009 Tony Awards. Nobody gets clobbered in the New Line movie but perhaps director Adam Shankman should. He succeeds in draining most of the fun from a vehicle that was all about the winking humor of its flagrant cheesiness. PHOTOS Rock of Ages Premiere Features Tom Cruise and Julianne Hough Plus Josh Duhamel and Fergie in Costume Shankman did a serviceable job on New Lines 2007 screen redo of Hairspray. But he was handed more winning material and songs crafted expressly to tell a story not generic anthems shoehorned into a jokey construct. Working with screenwriters Justin Theroux Chris DArienzo and Allan Loeb who adapted DArienzos original book for Rock of Ages the director has not found a way to translate the musicals affectionately mocking humor to film. Shankman lacks a light touch. Only when the invaluable Russell Brand is onscreen -- playing a droll variation of his Get Him to the Greek character with a Nikki Sixx makeover -- does this bloated gratuitously star-laden rethink come close to hitting the right tone. The main attraction no doubt will be Tom Cruise in another stunt performance to pair with his Tropic Thunder role. First seen in bejeweled leonine codpiece assless chaps and some elaborate ink emerging from beneath a blanket of hot groupies he channels Axl Rose as Stacee Jaxx an out-of-control rock god rarely separated from a bottle of scotch or from the monkey sidekick he calls Hey Man. STORY Alec Baldwin Talks About His Gay Kiss With Russell Brand at Rock of Ages Premiere The outrageously egomaniacal characterization should be a hoot but in truth Cruises quasi-mystical sozzled intensity gets wearisome. Theres just too much of him. Instead of one great showcase number (Bon Jovis ""Wanted Dead or Alive"") he gets a string of them. And in the Glee era of Auto-Tune even his vocal prowess barely registers as a novelty. A role that should have been a tasty extended cameo instead has been built up to crowd the headliners and frankly they cant withstand the competition. In a film that continually forgets where to focus those nominal leads are Sherrie (Julianne Hough) an Oklahoma girl fresh off the Greyhound in 1987 Los Angeles dreaming of stardom as a singer and Drew (Diego Boneta) an aspiring rocker working as a barback at fictitious Sunset Strip music venue The Bourbon Room (think Whisky a Go Go). Hearts are instantly aflutter when Drew comforts Sherrie after shes mugged getting her a waitressing job at the club. Qamp;A Rock Of Ages Executive Music Producer Rates Tom Cruises Vocal Skills Oscar Potential Embodiments of the small-town girl and city boy from Journeys ""Dont Stop Believing"" Sherrie and Drew sing sweetly and make a cute pair of lovebirds but theyre bland and uninteresting. Even in badass rocker-wear they look like they belong in a High School Musical sequel not a sweaty mosh pit. Running parallel to their obstacle-strewn love story are the efforts of philandering mayor Mike Whitmore (a misused Bryan Cranston) and his family values-crusading wife Patricia (Catherine Zeta-Jones) to shut down The Bourbon and remove the depraved metallurgists threatening the moral sanctity of the citys children. In addition to their protests Bourbon Room owner Dennis Dupree (Alec Baldwin) is dealing with fiscal headaches. He hopes a farewell show before Stacee quits his band to go solo will get the club back in the black. But the rock stars unscrupulous manager Paul Gill (Paul Giamatti) thwarts that plan. Theres also Stacees interview with Rolling Stone reporter Constance Sack (Malin Akerman) a confrontational encounter that makes the rocker reassess his priorities. In a plodding script that takes two long hours to tell a thin boy-meets/loses/wins-back-girl story in an elusive paradise none of these threads provides any sense of urgency. Thats because the screenwriters and director run out of fresh ideas in the first half-hour. After that ADHD sets in as they struggle to keep too many characters in play. Their solution is to load the film with endless multi-character song montages that do little to advance the plot. As a karaoke selection it yields diminishing returns. Like the stage musical the clash between Strip denizens and conservative zealots climaxes in a musical duel that repurposes Starships ""We Built This City"" and Twisted Sisters ""Were Not Gonna Take It"" for the respective causes. But theres insufficient momentum for the conflict to be more than perfunctory. For someone with a background in choreography Shankman shows little aptitude for shooting dance numbers. A notable example is Zeta-Jones big song ""Hit Me With Your Best Shot."" While choreographer Mia Michaels borrows signature moves from vintage Pat Benatar videos Patricia and her backup team of church ladies just look awkward. Zeta-Jones appears stiff throughout the movie while pros like Giamatti and Baldwin are wasted. Giamattis role relies for humor on 80s wardrobe crimes topped by a heinous ponytail and Baldwin is saddled with a deadening wig as over-the-hill rock disciple Dennis. He shows glimmers of his usual sly comic spark in a handful of moments with Brand as his club technician Lonny and their duet on REO Speedwagons ""Cant Fight This Feeling"" is a high point. In the stage production Lonny served as narrator or ""rock conjurer."" Given that the live wire Brand is easily the films best asset expanding rather than diminishing his role here might have been a good idea. Mary J. Blige turns up late in the action as Justice den mother of The Venus Club for Gentlemen where Sherrie takes a job in her hour of need. Blige lends her soulful pipes to a few numbers but like Cruise she outstays her usefulness. Production designer Jon Hutman does a solid job of re-creating 1980s Sunset Strip sleaze and costumer Rita Ryack hits the right notes in reviving contemporary fashions ugliest decade without going over the top. A handful of rock and pop figures from the period show up in cameos including Debbie Gibson Sebastian Bach Kevin Cronin Nuno Bettencourt and Joel Hoekstra. But Rock of Ages neither evokes an authentic feeling to celebrate the era nor spreads much joy making fun of it. Instead it just drones on like a limp cover version.
