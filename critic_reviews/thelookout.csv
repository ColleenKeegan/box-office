In a desperate attempt to sustain a regular life he takes a janitor position mopping floors in a rural bank but gets caught up in a premeditated heist with a shady bunch of thugs who he may have known before the accident.Making good use of its snow-capped Fargo-esque landscape and utilising the existential angst of Memento the film generates an admirable sense of unease but lacks the velocity and taut provocative structure of those predecessors resulting in a straightforward genre piece in which double-crosses and surprise twists lead to the inevitable.  Still Gordon-Levitt is superb as the cognitively challenged protagonist as is the aptly cast Isla Fisher in the role of Luvlee Lemons a sickly sweet femme fatale. Jeff Daniels leaves no scenery unchewed but provides sardonic comic relief as Pratts blind sex-starved roommate. Forgettable fun.

"Lookout Mind over money | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesLookout Mind over moneyLucky for the viewer The Lookout doesnt follow its own storytelling advice.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. March 30 2007 (out of 4)Starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt Jeff Daniels Matthew Goode and Isla Fisher. Written and directed by Scott Frank. 99 minutes. At major theatres. 14A  Article Continued BelowLucky for the viewer The Lookout doesnt follow its own storytelling advice.""You just got to start at the end and work backwards"" blind man Lewis (Jeff Daniels) tells his roommate and pal Chris Pratt (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who is trying to rewrite his own life story.This isnt the type of drama where the ending is a foregone conclusion. Its a crafted puzzle penned and directed by Scott Frank who is best known as the scripter for the Elmore Leonard movie adaptations Out of Sight and Get Shorty.The movie ambles towards its intentions but thats no hardship. When we first meet the moody Chris a hockey ace sidelined by a car crash he caused he seems to be wallowing in self-pity. In reality hes attempting to cope with the brain damage caused by the accident which has all but erased his ability to retain short-term memories.Chris has to write to-do lists to fulfill even the most mundane daily activities. Even making dinner for himself is a chore. His lovingly acerbic roomie Lewis often bails out Chris his lack of vision being the lesser of the two handicaps.The only job Chris can manage in his Kansas City farming community is night janitor for a bank. Hed like to work his way up to becoming a teller but his inability to count properly or to remember things in proper sequence makes that a faint hope. Enter the shifty presence of Gary Spargo (Matthew Goode) a former schoolmate whom Chris can barely recall. Unlike Chris he seems to have all the answers especially when it comes to women. Gary introduces Chris to Luvlee Lemons (Isla Fisher) an ex-stripper who immediately takes a shine to the former hockey great.While Luvlee is busy working on Chriss body Gary is working on his mind. Turns out Gary is part of a gang that has been casing the bank where Chris mops. Gary knows there are times of the year when the bank is fattened with wads of cash brought in by farmers and one such time is coming right up.Gary proposes that Chris act as the lookout for a robbery. All he has to do is keep an eye out for the cops while the gang members drill into the safe to get the money. The idea is as simple as it is seductive to Chris. This is his chance to score again and to get back part of the life hes lost.""Whoever has the money has the power"" Gary tells Chris. Remember that line and follow the money.As youd expect from a writer steeped in Elmore Leonards coiling prose there are complications second thoughts unforeseen developments and plans that are just too good to be true.As the malleable Chris Gordon-Levitt creates a character both pitiable and redeemable. Its a quiet triumph for the actor who appeared in the ensemble gem Brick but who is best known for his work in TVs 3rd Rock From the Sun.His acting is strong enough to withstand genial upstaging by old hand Jeff Daniels who turns Lewis into much more than a secondary sidekick. Lewis has all of the movies best lines but he can also steal a scene with just a sly grin.Also good are Sergio Di Zio as the towns own Barney Fife and Bruce McGill as Chriss wealthy father who struggles between giving his son constant handouts and letting him languish.This is Scott Franks first feature as a director and it speaks of more good things to come even if The Lookout does have a couple of nagging plot holes - like how the bank is lit up like a Christmas tree while the gang is robbing it.Frank shot the film near Winnipeg last year working with cinematographer Alar Kivilo who turned winter wonderlands menacing in A Simple Plan and The Ice Storm.The Lookout bears watching.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Written and directed by Scott Frank. 99 minutes. Rated R for language some violence and sexual content. Several theaters. Scott Franks moody thriller ""The Lookout"" has at its center a young man who isnt there. Chris (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) was once a golden boy; a star hockey player and a popular figure at his Midwestern high school. A terrible accident on prom night ended all that and now four years later Chris is a ghost of his former self. Permanently changed by a brain injury suffered that night he moves through his uneventful days his spotty memory aided by handwritten reminders. At his job as a night janitor for a bank he plays hockey alone in the dim light with a broom and wastebasket trying to capture a fleeting moment of what he once was. Frank a well-known screenwriter (""Out of Sight"" ""Get Shorty"" ""Minority Report"") makes his directing debut with some challenging material. Its difficult to put a character as unresponsive as Chris at the center of a film; the audience doesnt have a way to connect with him and the sad blank way Gordon-Levitt plays him is extraordinarily subtle. But Frank has created a scenario through which Chris immediately engages our sympathies An old high school friend Gary (Matthew Goode) turns up and befriends Chris before revealing an ulterior motive. Hes planning a bank heist and needs the janitors help. As Chris becomes a not-quite-unwilling pawn of Garys gang ""The Lookout"" occasionally slips into an easy pitfall Chris brain injury functions in the way injuries often do in the movies. At moments crucial to the plot hes capable of remembering essential things; at other less-crucial moments he sometimes cant. Its not always believable but Franks taut direction and smart dialogue make it always compelling. And its darkly elegant to look at. Director of photography Alar Kivilo finds the damp bleak misery in a Midwestern winter and creates one breathtaking shot with Isla Fisher who plays Chris would-be girlfriend (a setup arranged by Gary). Standing framed in a frost-rimmed window her pale beauty quietly glows like a portrait on the wall of a Victorian parlor. All of the performances (except for one too-obvious Bad Guy Who Doesnt Speak) are nicely nuanced particularly Jeff Daniels as Chris blind laid-back roommate and Fisher whose tiny metallic voice finds a touching wistfulness in her tough-girl character. (Her name it must be said is Luvlee Lemons which should have been a warning to Chris right there.) Gordon-Levitt the talented star of ""Mysterious Skin"" finds something heartbreaking behind Chris blankness; you can almost watch on his face memory quietly draining away. Quietly flavored with sad resignation its a performance thats remarkable for what isnt there.

Starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt Jeff Daniels and Matthew Goode. Directed by Scott Frank. (R. 99 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""The Lookout"" begins spectacularly with a convertible careening along an open road on a late summer night. Inside are four teenagers out for a good time. The driver Chris (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) embodies the jittery recklessness of youth when you believe yourself invincible. Anxious for his girl to experience fireflies in all their luminescent glory he turns off his car lights. As he speeds up so does a sense of impending doom. Its like the chicken race in ""Rebel Without a Cause"" where you wait with dread for the inevitable sound of a crash. Judging a movie by its first few minutes isnt fair but then neither is life and such a heart-stopping opening scene is sure to raise expectations (much as a bad start invariably is interpreted as a bad omen). Everything that follows in ""The Lookout"" is destined to be a letdown. It settles down to be a solidly above-average thriller about the planning and execution of a bank heist in which Chris -- diminished by a brain injury in the auto accident that took the lives of two passengers and the leg of his high school sweetheart -- is the lookout (in case youre wondering where the title comes from). Although filmmaker Scott Frank is unable to sustain the initial intensity he does a credible job of not signaling where the story is heading and ramps up excitement with a number of unexpected twists and turns. Frank is best known for his smart adaptation of Elmore Leonards ""Out of Sight"" putting sassy dialogue in the mouths of George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez that helped solidify them as movie stars. ""Lookout"" is based on an original script by Frank that may similarly boost the fledgling film careers of Gordon-Levitt (the unjustly overlooked ""Brick"" and ""Mysterious Skin"" already showed the distance hes come from ""3rd Rock From the Sun"") and Matthew Goode as the sleazeball Gary who sweet-talks Chris into participating in a robbery at a bank where hes nighttime janitor. Frank provides the co-stars with a nicely nuanced scene of Gary insinuating himself into the life of the unsuspecting Chris whose head injury has left him forgetful -- he has to write everything down like the amnesiac in ""Memento"" -- and unsure around the opposite sex. Gary sidles up to him at a bar and makes a pass at a woman whom Chris has been eyeing. He dutifully copies down the line Gary feeds her (""And I thought I was good-looking"") but when Chris tries it out later he gets the inflection all wrong and receives a chilly response. Gordon-Levitt and Goode play off each other convincingly -- showing how a con man could seduce someone to act against his will -- and Jeff Daniels brings a bite to what could have been a sappy role of Chris excessively well-meaning blind roommate. ""The Lookout"" is Franks first outing as a director and his inexperience shows. Except for that early stunning panorama of a sky lit up by fireflies theres not much going on visually. He misses opportunities particularly in flashbacks of Chris remembering his former life as a star athlete and catnip to coeds. These moments flash by too quickly to comprehend all that Chris has lost. Prosaic shots of the robbers at work fail to justify the enormous buildup to the heist. Another matter probably will nag at you because it doesnt compute. Chris is so out of it that he has to scribble down instructions about what to wear each day and when to take his meds. Yet he drives himself everywhere. Thats one car you wouldnt want to get into. But you could do a whole lot worse than go along for the ride in ""Lookout."" -- Advisory Language violence and some sexual content.

BY Jack Mathewsdaily News Movie Critic Friday March 30 2007 400 AM ""The Lookout"" Drama about a brain-damaged bank janitor drawn into a planned robbery. With Joseph Gordon-Levitt Jeff Daniels Isla Fisher. Director Scott Frank (139). R Language violence sexual content. At area theaters. Like Guy Pearce in ""Memento"" the title character in writer-director Scott Franks ""The Lookout"" needs to write notes to himself so he wont forget what he has to do each day. But Joseph Gordon-Levitts Chris Pratt is not seeking revenge; hes just trying to reclaim some semblance of the life he had before an auto accident left him with severe brain damage and a broken heart. The accident which we see in the films opening was caused by him and it left two people dead and his girlfriend with an amputated leg. Three years later Chris is working as a night janitor at a small bank. Hes estranged from his affluent parents and his only friend is the blind man (Jeff Daniels) with whom he shares an apartment. Former stripper Luvlee Lemons played by Isla Fisher is part of the bait used to lure the down-on-his-luck Chris. Into his foggy guilt-ridden life comes the flashy Gary Spargo (Matthew Goode) a one-time casual friend who remembers when Chris was the star of the high school hockey team. Gary aggressively befriends Chris and introduces him to a former stripper with the stage name of Luvlee Lemons (Isla Fisher luvlee indeed). This sexual encounter rekindles something in Chris but its not for real. Luvlee is Garys girlfriend and is part of his scheme to use Chris as a lookout while he and his scruffy partners rob the bank. Frank who adapted the Elmore Leonard books ""Get Shorty"" and ""Out of Sight"" for the screen is making his directing debut and its solid work. Though ""The Lookout"" is eventually a genre film with a tense bang-up ending it is also a thoughtful study of a young man trying to make sense of a world that he is having to learn all over again. The cast is excellent at every position; Daniels is especially good as the dry-witted Lewis who has adopted the role of Chris surrogate guardian. But its Gordon-Levitts movie and his grasp of this role shows why hes regarded as one of his generations brightest stars.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post On this the third rock from the Sun an impressive reintroduction is underway. Joseph Gordon-Levitt - Tommy Solomon on that aforementioned 90s sitcom about a family of aliens making do on Earth - has been transiting from boyhood to manhood comedy to drama in a slew of indie flicks. In the dark heist thriller ""The Lookout"" Gordon-Levitt brings fractured life to damaged Chris Pratt the son of a wealthy entrepreneur in a Midwestern town. In ""Mysterious Skin"" (2004) Gordon-Levitt played a gay hustler who learns the hard way hes not in Kansas anymore after relocating to New York City. The next year the actor stepped into the gumshoes of a hard-boiled detective working a high-school mystery in the original patois-driven ""Brick."" As ""The Lookout"" begins Chris sits behind the wheel of a convertible. Its prom night and his mood might be described as ""invincible."" He revs down a two-lane blacktop outside Noel Kan. his pretty blond girlfriend beside him. His best friend and his date perch atop the back seat. Before you begin admiring Chris adrenalized teenage power think again. Hes a jerk albeit the sort of handsome celebrated kind who owns his world - or feels he does. While trying to deliver that world he crashes. Four years later hes sharing an apartment with a blind roommate named Lewis (Jeff Daniels) writing lists to recall each mornings routine. ""I wake up"" is the boldest declaration he pens in a small notebook. After that he grows vague. A wrecked memory isnt new territory for a crime thriller. Christopher Nolans ""Memento"" comes to mind as an admired example of the genre. But writer-director Scott Frank exhibits a genuine interest in a young life upended by a severe brain injury. And Gordon-Levitt gives his characters pauses inappropriate comments and rote recitations real flavor. Preying on Chris mix of frustration boredom and occasional fury (a can of diced tomatoes really gets it) is ex-con Gary Spargo. British actor Matthew Goode (""Match Point"") plays Spargo who plans to rob the bank where Chris is a janitor. Its not simply Chris disability Gary exploits. He yanks at something deeper. Entitlement it seems slumbers in the furthest recesses of the young mans brain. ""Youre better than this"" Gary says teasing the former high-school hockey stars need for an identity. He takes Chris to a squalid farmhouse to meet his crew. So much for better. He plies Chris with booze then gives him a chaser of curdled Robin Hood theories about agribusiness. Frank who adapted Elmore Leonards vibrantly fun ""Get Shorty"" and ""Out of Sight"" here makes his directorial debut with a markedly different tone. As tempered as Gordon-Levitts portrayal is Chris isnt easy to root for. Luvlee (Isla Fisher) the former stripper Gary hooks Chris up with recounts one of Chris hockey games to him. She intends to gush. Instead the story underscores what we thought at the movies start Chris was a spoiled cad. ""The Lookout"" is a glum then volatile amorality tale. Hoping its protagonist triumphs over the really bad guys comes with its own ethical wrinkles. Its a solid debut. Frank never overpowers this at-times familiar material. Aiming for a film thats character-driven he gets sharp performances that hold promise for the nascent director. As Lewis Jeff Daniels gives the movie some much needed buoyancy. Perhaps as an onscreen surrogate for writers everywhere Lewis delivers a sweet riff on the power of story. Hes even more deftly amusing and wise when he cross-examines Luvlee about her intentions. ""He who has the money has the power"" Gary drills into Chris damaged cranium repeatedly. ""The Lookout"" offers a rebuttal. He who has the friend has the heart of the movie. |""The Lookout"" R for language some violence and sexual content|1 hour 39 minutes| HEIST DRAMA| Written and directed by Scott Frank; photography by Alar Kivilo; starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt Jeff Daniels Matthew Goode Carla Gugino Bruce McGill and Isla Fisher|Opens today at area theaters Lisa Kennedy Digital amp; Driveway Delivery - 50% Off More in Music Polica Synth-pop in the age of racial strife July 29 2016 Indie synth-pop band Polica (pronounced poh-LEE-sah) knew that their newest album ""United Crushers"" wasnt going to get as much attention as their debut album ""Give You the Ghost"" did.

In the process its gracious enough to kick in a few extras a nifty central gimmick a self-effacing lead performance and a big slice of ham from supporting actor Jeff Daniels .Weve seen rich high school kid Chris Pratt (Joseph Gordon-Levitt ) live fast and almost die young in the films eerie opening scene and as the story proper begins hes still dealing with the consequences of a massive head injury four years later. In particular Chris has difficulty ""sequencing"" -- remembering in what order to do things. This makes opening a can of tomatoes a psychological obstacle course one of hundreds he faces every day.Chris goes to therapy sessions shares an apartment with a sardonic blind man named Lewis (Daniels ) and cleans the floors at a small-town bank. Guilt lost glory and a cold businessman father (Bruce McGill ) combine to send him into the hands of Gary Spargo (Matthew Goode ) a former school chum turned very bad man. Gary and his friends want to rob Chriss bank and they need his help.Thats it pretty much. ""The Lookout"" has the economy and some of the artistry of a low-budget thriller from the 50s a curt acknowledgement that blood will out and you might as well pay attention to the characters.There are four of any consequence. Goodes Gary is an insinuating barroom charmer with flashes of violence just under the surface. Its hard to believe Goode is British since there are guys like Gary waiting to beat you up in pool halls across America.Isla Fisher  the sweet nutcase from ""Wedding Crashers "" plays an ex-stripper who holds on to her stage name like a security blanket -- Luvlee Lemons (it may be the only creative thing she has done in her life). Gary uses her to seduce Chris and Fisher gives the character a dim honest integrity as if the old film noir moll Gloria Grahame had been reborn as a pole dancer.Daniels just has fun as Lewis a character who gets all the good lines and knows it. Blind though he is Lewis has seen plenty and not even a shotgun stuck in his face fazes him. Thats a B-movie conceit but look its a B-movie.Maybe thats why Gordon-Levitt looks confused though as if he expected this movie to be the next ""Memento "" and therefore a logical progression from his 2006 arthouse hit ""Brick ."" Or maybe hes just getting inside Chriss fractured head. The actor gives a tight unshowy performance but it only comes to life in the final scenes when everything hinges on Chris getting a lot of complicated things in order or else.The writer-director is Scott Frank  a screenwriter of ""Minority Report "" ""Get Shorty "" and many other films  who here steps behind the camera for the first time. If he has consciously created a story line so simple it ultimately seems undercooked that may just be part of the learning curve.He probably knows ""The Lookout"" will look just fine when you stumble up on it on late-night cable a few months from now. And he gets enough right here that whatever he does next some of us will be paying attention.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. For more on movies go to boston.com/ae/movies/blog.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor March 30 2007 Save for later Saved ""The Lookout"" has a premise that on paper at least might seem contrived. A Midwestern high school star Chris Pratt (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) almost dies in a car accident while joy riding with friends and suffers serious brain damage. He goes from being the schools hockey star to working as the night janitor in a small local bank which it turns out is being cased for a robbery by a high school acquaintance Gary (Matthew Goode).If you think you can see where this is going youd be only half right. Although writer-director Scott Frank making his directorial debut plays out a series of film-noir conventions he rejiggers the genre by making Chris a hero more akin to say a character in ""Awakenings"" than to one in ""Double Indemnity.""Chris is from a wealthy family but prefers living in a rundown apartment he shares with a blind roommate (Jeff Daniels) who compensates for his condition by zeroing in on everybodys frailties. He is however protective of Chris who is not as self-sustaining as he would like to believe he is. Although Chris has ambitions to become a bank teller his short-term memory is so bad that he needs to carry around a notepad just to jot down essential information in order to get him through the day. In conversation such as the one he has at the beginning of the film with his attractive case worker (Carla Gugino in a too brief appearance) he often blurts out uncensored and inappropriate comments. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? When Gary trying to cozy up to Chris introduces him to local stripper (Isla Fisher) Luvlee Lemons the sadness of Chriss situation comes full circle. He thinks that being the inside man in the robbery will bring him the cash he needs to become a new person. Chris doesnt see what we do - that his dreams are largely delusional. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 But - and heres where the film throws us a curve - he is also far more enterprising than we might have expected. As the story plays out he turns his disability into an advantage through sheer force of will.At times ""The Lookout"" stretches credulity. Having a brain-damaged ex-golden boy team up with a jokester blind man is a bit much even by noir standards.Frank wrote the film adaptations of Elmore Leonards ""Out of Sight"" and ""Get Shorty"" and at times he seems to be trying for a similar tough-tender tone. But the material here is more fragile than Leonards more touchy-feely.In the end thats a good thing. We already have a surfeit of movie wiseguys. Gordon-Levitt best known for TVs ""3rd Rock From the Sun"" and offbeat indies such as ""Brick"" and ""Mysterious Skin"" is affable but also carries a suggestion of something dark and inchoate. Daniels transforms what might have been a one-note role into a many-layered marvel.Nobody can play stupid better than Daniels - think ""Dumb and Dumber"" - and as it turns out few can play smarter. Hes a sharp asset in a sharp movie. Grade B+ Rated R for language some violence and sexual content.

"All Eyes on Gordon-Levitt washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On All Eyes on Gordon-Levitt ""The Lookouts"" Joseph Gordon-Levitt stands out as a janitor at a bank targeted by robbers. (By Allen Fraser -- Miramax) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints Friday March 30 2007 Former ""3rd Rock From the Sun"" cast member Joseph Gordon-Levitt made audiences sit up and take notice a few years ago when he made a startling star turn in the coming-of-age drama ""Mysterious Skin"" dispelling any suspicions that he was purely a one-hit sitcom wonder. Hes still good in ""The Lookout"" even if the movie itself is a relatively trivial piece of pseudo-arty pulp. The directorial debut of screenwriter Scott Frank (who wrote the crackling scripts for ""Get Shorty"" and ""Out of Sight"" among others) ""The Lookout"" is a heist flick with a twist Gordon-Levitt plays former high school jock Chris Pratt who after a tragic car accident on prom night is recovering from a serious brain injury. Trying to put his life back together hes working as a janitor in a rural bank that happens to be the target of a bunch of neer-do-wells (including Matthew Goode) he may have known before the accident. (See In Focus on Page 33.) ""The Lookout"" takes place in and around Kansas City Mo. and Frank captures the countryside (played by Canada) in austere tones worthy of ""In Cold Blood."" But the dour downbeat story eventually spirals into grisly Grand Guignol and contrivance. Still Gordon-Levitt is superb and Jeff Daniels delivers a wry and wily performance as Pratts blind roommate. -- Ann Hornaday The Lookout R 99 minutes Contains profanity violence and sexual content.

"Lookout The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; lookout-the ) Lookout The (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli The Lookout is an effective little thriller that almost works from taut beginning to unspectacular end. The premise is interesting and the story is developed in such a way that the viewer is engaged throughout. The opening scene hooks us and the movie spends the next 90-plus minutes reeling us in. The ending however is where The Lookouts problems arise. The concluding sequences are paradoxically overplotted and underwritten. One character vanishes suddenly and inexplicably while the story engages in a few too easy contrivances in order to wrap things up. I left the theater entertained but not fully satisfied. The Lookout is the directorial debut of Scott Frank the respected screenwriter of such notable films as Dead Again Get Shorty Out of Sight and Minority Report. Frank has learned from the directors who have helmed his films (Branagh Spielberg Soderbergh). His style is clear with occasional flashes of art - enough to make the picture visually pleasing while generating sufficient atmosphere to enhance the building tension. Story-wise however this is one of Franks weaker efforts. Its more linear than one has come to expect from the director and the dialogue lacks the flair of his better screenplays. Its passable but no more. Chris Pratt (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a star high school hockey player with the world at his feet. Like many teenagers he believes himself to be indestructible until the night when he pushes things too far and is involved in a horrific car accident that leaves him with a brain injury. Four years later Chris is as recovered as he is likely to be. He has short-term memory issues and has to employ a pocket notebook to keep things straight. He wants desperately to lead a normal life but he has no girlfriend and his only real buddy is his blind older roommate Lewis (Jeff Daniels). One day at a bar he encounters Gary (Matthew Goode) a guy who claims to have once dated Chris sister. The two strike up a friendship. Gary offers Chris two things - a companion who wont judge him and the chance for a hookup with a beautiful ex-stripper named Luvlee Lemons (Isla Fisher) whos a member of Garys social circle. These benefits come with a price however. Gary and his gang intend to rob the bank where Chris works as a janitor and they want his help. Gary seduces him by stating that ""the money is the power"" but when a double-cross occurs Chris takes that phrase to heart. Thrillers featuring characters with short term memory problems risk being mentioned alongside Memento and that comparison does not favor The Lookout. This is a less ambitious motion picture with more modest goals. Additionally Chriss mental deficiencies do not leave him completely incapacitated; he uses notes clues and routines to get through the day but he also doesnt forget events ten minutes after they happen. His impediment is with sequencing memories. Additionally he has anger management issues and is easily manipulated. Gary uses Chris resentment toward his father and his desire for sexual fulfillment as recruitment tools. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is compelling as Chris a kid whos more savvy than almost anyone gives him credit for. In the wake of Brick The Lookout offers the actor a continued opportunity to break from his TV roots and display his range. As the potential femme fatale Isla Fisher is adorable but not particularly dark or dangerous and the loose ends surrounding her character represent one of the movies obvious flaws. Matthew Goode is delicious as Gary the guy who can shift from charismatic to vicious in the blink of an eye. The most chilling portrayal comes from Greg Dunham as Bone Garys right hand man. He generates dread without saying a word. In the end The Lookout works better as a character study than a thriller. Chris situation is more interesting than the heist which occupies a surprisingly small portion of the running time. If the crime elements are undercooked at least the character development is effectively handled. Nevertheless the movies anti-climatic resolution in concert with the holes left by the occasionally untidy script result in The Lookout not living up to its promise. Compared to some of Franks past projects this is a tepid offering.

Plus Adam Sandlers 9/11 movie. By David Edelstein Published Oct 25 2007 ShareThis Illustration by Paul Willoughby  (Photo Allen Fraser/Courtesy of Miramax Films) Chris Pratt played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt is the perfect patsy-hero for the crafty little minor-key thriller The Lookout a young man who has sinned in his own eyes and is also brain-damagedcompromised both morally and neurologically. When we first see him hes Slapshot Pratt a high-school rich-kid hockey star whos so certain of his indestructibility that he sails along a Midwest country road sans headlights the better to show off all the fireflies (theyre mating) to his girlfriend his buddy and his buddys girlfriendtwo of whom dont survive the subsequent collision. Now he spends his days at an independent life skills center and his nights as a janitor at a small bank where hell never have the cognitive function to rise to the level of teller. Sometimes I cry for no reason he writes in the journal he keeps in the battle to make sense of his life. The Lookout is the directing debut of the screenwriter Scott Frank (Out of Sight Minority Report) who reportedly wrote the script years agowell before Memento in which a brain injury plays havoc with both the protagonists short-term memory and the movies syntax. For those with a taste for neo-noir it might be disappointing that Chriss handicap doesnt generate seismic spatial-temporal dislocations. Franks ambitions are comparatively modest to deliver a nice tight genre piece with people you like watching so much that you barely feel the directors squeeeeze until you suddenly cant breathe. The forlorn Chris finds himself befriended at a bar by Gary Spargo (Matthew Goode) and a babe who calls herself Luvlee (the luscious Isla Fisher). Gary was a big fan of his high-school hockey playing Luvlee was such a big fan she cant believe shes kissing Slapshot Pratt The poor pratI mean Prattis the easiest bank-employee mark imaginable. Gordon-Levitt is a major tabula rasa actor. Its simpler to say what he doesnt do wronganythingthan what he does right. As in Mysterious Skin and Brick hes a minimalist no fuss no placards no Method sense-memory exercises. You dont catch him playing brain-damaged. You know his Chris is in chaos by the way he doesnt seize the space by what he takes away from the character. His feelings run deepest when that rubber face goes slack. Gordon-Levitt is a great re-actor and he bounces off some barnstormers here. As his intemperate blind roommate Lewis nice-guy-actor Jeff Daniels gets to wallow in the head of another self-righteous jerk (the last one was in The Squid and the Whale) and Danielss relish for playing a man with a chip on his shoulder the size of a tractor and nothing left to lose makes you love the character beyond reason. In Match Point Matthew Goode played Jonathan Rhys Meyerss mysteriously welcoming upper-class tennis partnermysteriously because Goode couldnt help but give the character an impish subtext as if some skeezy punch line were coming (except that Woody Allen forgot to write it). In The Lookout hes playing an American but the wiles are entertainingly English Its that mocking sinceritythat ironic fatuous niceness. Goodes Gary is just the friendliest guy Hes seductive even when you know where the movie is headingand when the editor Jill Savitt steals a beat from his close-ups to give you subliminal willies. Its almost a relief when the double entendres stop and Gary shows his true feral colors. Franks writing is razor-sharp his filmmaking whistle-clean. As a fan of sharp razors and clean whistles I enjoyed The Lookoutyet I did feel let down by the climax which ought to have been blunter and messier and crazier and more cathartic. It sounds churlish I know but a thriller with a hero like Gordon-Levitts Chris should be more of an act of sympathetic imagination. The payoff needed to be more brain-damaged. Reign Over Me is the rare studio film with the fullness of a novela novel that reels and overreaches and never finds its footing. The writer and director Mike Binder (The Upside of Anger) brings his screwball-sitcom temperament to a fictional premise that would stagger our most ruminative tragedian. Five years after the death of his wife and three daughters in one of the planes that crashed into the World Trade Center Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler) remains in a state of extreme denialhe seems more brain-damaged than the hero of The Lookout. Whizzing around Manhattan on a scooter hes hailed by Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle) his college roommate and dental-school chum. While Alan recalls their relationship Charlie nods politely (Cool cool) and then prepares to go on his way. He doesnt want to remember anything. In some ways Charlie isnt a stretch for Sandler. His comic shtick has always depended on him living in his own head and being self-servingly slow-witted. The persona is a hostile onepassive-aggressive with the odd ferocious ejaculation. But Sandler was surprisingly soulful as an overgrown adolescent lashing out at the world for its unreliability in Paul Thomas Andersons tipsy romantic fantasia Punch-Drunk Love. And as Charlie Fineman hes like a dammed-up Bob Dylanhe even sports a shaggy Dylan-circa-1969 hair mop and a mumble that seems to issue straight from his sinuses. Hes always ready to boogieespecially when someone wants him to acknowledge the death of his family. The worst are his wifes parents (Robert Klein and Melinda Dillon) whove clung to the tragedy and rather selfishly feel they need his presence to help them cope. Cheadles Alan isnt that extreme but he does enlist the aid of a psychiatrist played by an oddly castbut not badLiv Tyler. 1 2 Next Share this story...

Vet scriptwriter Scott Frank makes a more-than-promising debut as a feature helmer with ""The Lookout"" a stealthy neo-noir drama that isnt afraid to take its time developing characters on the way to the payoff of a neatly designed caper scenario. Set for a March 30 domestic rollout pic could conceivably play even better in European markets where auds are traditionally more receptive to such muted moody fare. Even so favorable reviews and enthusiastic word of mouth could generate fair-to-good theatrical biz before ""The Lookout"" looks at a long homevid shelf life. Given Franks background adapting Elmore Leonards ""Get Shorty"" and ""Out of Sight"" its not surprising to discern a distinctly Leonard-esque flavor to his tale of crime and desire. But this is a Leonard-influenced original with the humor tamped down -- way down actually but still dark and biting -- and the undercurrents of dread raised very close to flood level. Chris Pratt (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a Midwestern golden boy with everything going for him -- wealthy parents a beautiful girlfriend fame as a high-school hockey star -- when he almost dies in an auto mishap. A few years later hes still recovering from severe brain damage often struggling with an unreliable memory and drifting through fogs of disorientation as he attempts the simplest tasks. Employed as a night janitor at a small-town bank Chris would like to become a teller. But he so lacks organizational skills that he often forgets where he placed the can opener in the apartment he shares with Lewis (Jeff Daniels) his blind roommate and mentor. Lewis is patient and encouraging but also snarky and sardonic and Daniels steals clusters of scenes with his dry delivery of droll wisecracks and comebacks. When Chris runs into old school acquaintance Gary Spargo (Matthew Goode) hes briefly cheered out of his workaday gloom. And that cheer is greatly enhanced when Gary introduces Chris to Luvlee Lemons (Isla Fisher) an ex-stripper quite willing to be Chris private dancer. But the coincidence of Garys reappearance in Chris life is more apparent than real. The raspy-voiced ""friend"" is part of a small gang thats been casing local banks -- including the one where Chris is employed. As Chris finds himself torn between wanting to remain honest and needing to regain control of his life hes sorely tempted by the lure of ill-gotten gains. When push comes to shove however he has serious second thoughts. But it may be too late to do himself -- or a couple of innocent bystanders -- any good. Shades of ""Memento"" arise as Chris labors mightily to remember how to complete actions that he begins and there are more fleeting echoes of ""Fargo"" and ""The Cavemans Valentine."" But Frank works his own sort of storytelling magic with the slightly similar premise firmly establishing Chris as a complex guilt-ridden character -- played with compelling persuasiveness by Gordon-Levitt -- before expanding the arresting psychological study to encompass low-key thriller plot mechanics. Pic is sensationally gripping during an extended latenight sequence in the bank as Frank ratchets up suspense with familiar tropes and at least one jolting surprise; scripter is quite adept at planting early portents and the Law of Chekhovs Gun -- i.e. never introduce a firearm unless you intend to use it -- is acknowledged here. One complaint A major supporting character simply disappears from the action never to be seen or even referenced again. Well-cast supporting players including Bruce McGill as Chris tough-loving father Sergio Di Zio as a friendly deputy sheriff and (briefly) Carla Gugino as Chris case worker serve the story well. Pic also boasts evocative lensing by Alar Kivilo (reminiscent of his wintry work in ""A Simple Plan"" and ""The Ice Storm"") and an insinuating score by James Newton Howard.
