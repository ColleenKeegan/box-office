""Away We Go"" reps a digression into loose anecdotal Amerindie-style terrain after helmer Sam Mendes starrier more high-stakes screen projects. But this episodic dramedy -- starring tube familiars John Krasinski and Maya Rudolph as a rudderless couple seeking a place to call home while on the brink of parenthood -- emerges as an oddly sour unappealing road-trip scenario. Penned by first-time scribes alt-lit favorites and real-life spouses Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida pic will likely find some defenders particularly among the authors fans. Still its theatrical career launching June 5 looks to be short with ancillary prospects modest. Burt (Krasinski of NBCs ""The Office"") and Verona (""Saturday Night Lives"" Rudolph) are expecting their first child in rural Colorado a habitat chosen for his parents proximity. (Hers died in an accident years earlier.) But blithe self-absorbed Jerry (Jeff Daniels) and Gloria (Catherine OHara) suddenly announce theyre whimsically moving to Belgium -- no matter that theyll miss their grandchilds birth. This prompts the younger pair having no friends no job obligations (both are long-distance freelancers) to pack up and look for somewhere more suitable to live. They embark on a complicated flight itinerary to see old pals and explore potential new nesting places. First stop is Phoenix to see Veronas former co-worker Lily (Allison Janney) husband Lowell (Jim Gaffigan) and their two children. But Lily has turned into such a vulgar abusive gorgon that spouse and kids have retreated into gloomy withdrawal. After a brief Tucson visit with Veronas well-adjusted sister Grace (Carmen Ejogo) its on to another example of domestic hell Burts childhood friend Ellen aka LN (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is a smugly superior U. of Wisconsin Womens Studies prof with a fawning ponytailed layabout common-law husband (Josh Hamilton) and a son who still sleeps with them. A seg in Montreal culminates in a bizarre stab at poignancy while a quick Miami side-trip to see Burts distraught brother (Paul Schneider) prompts the pics best scene a quiet tete-a-tete between the leads that sets up the pics low-key (if a little over-convenient) ending. Burts a bit immature and Verona the grown-up of the couple occasionally impatient (partly explained by the discomforts of advanced pregnancy). But the protags are essentially blank slates despite the skill and charm Krasinski and Rudolph bring to the roles. Its their job simply to represent ""normal"" against so many illustrations of bad parenting worse marriages and damaged adulthood. But given theyre such harmlessly pleasant folk why dont they have any non-messed-up friends? Because that would un-stack the deck in a script that needs to paint them as two lonely souls in a hostile world. But in positing normal as special the pic requires caricaturing almost everyone else. While handled by resourceful actors the foibles of the supporting characters are less funny than they are forced and unpleasant. Janney and Gyllenhaal in particular play figures venomously conceived. Meant to amp up the pics indie-quirky cred the soundtrack papered with lyrically trite soundalike cuts by Scottish singer-songwriter Alexi Murdoch instead makes progress seem more meandering and monotonous. Other design/tech contributions are solid. Still this alternately condescending and hazy material doesnt trigger the kind of sharp aesthetic choices Mendes and collaborators made in response to past projects from ""American Beauty"" to ""Revolutionary Road."" ""Away"" is billed as the first studio production adopting green filmmaking initiatives to reduce CO2 emissions.

You can imagine why after that gruelling anatomy of a failed marriage he was drawn to the story of a happy and well-adjusted if under-prepared couple on the threshold of family life. Lets hope it was more fun to make anyway because its pretty insufferable to watch.The script by husband and wife Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida follows semi-slacker thirtysomethings Burt (John Krasinski) and Verona (Maya Rudolph) as they search for the perfect site to raise their unborn child zipping from Arizona to Wisconsin Colorado to Carolina. Along the way they encounter relatives and old friends including Burts hippy-dippy parents (Jeff Daniels and Catherine OHara) and neo-feminist childhood pal (Maggie Gyllenhaal) Veronas braying former colleague (Allison Janney) and two old buddies (Chris Messina and Melanie Lynskey) and their adopted kids.Krasinski and Rudolph are amiable company and theres some nice scenic photography from Ellen Kuras (shot mostly in Connecticut). But the films laboured humour and self-satisfaction grate as does its twee indie-acoustic soundtrack. That every supporting character is depicted as insufferable or pitiable or both would be bad enough; whats worse is that the couple discover nothing about themselves that wasnt obvious from the opening unless you count the banal dictum that theres no place like home. A screenplay that jokes about the lack of tension between its leads should at least have something to say about their interaction with the rest of the world. This doesnt.

OVERRATED Quirky indie films The eccentric has been a cinematic staple as long as we can remember but were asking for a timeout after Sam Mendes ""Away We Go."" We love John Krasinski and Maya Rudolph but surrounded by such a rogues gallery of weirdos we barely had room to breathe much less care about their story. ""Indie"" is not code for ""strange people."" (Francois Duhamel / Focus Features) Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Verona and Burt are having a baby. But where? Where is a support system? Where would the lifestyle be right for raising a child?""I want her childhood to be Huck Finn-y"" Burt offers. Verona is equally idealistic. But being the mom-to-be shes also pragmatic. ""Were 34 and we dont even have this basic stuff worked out like where to live.""Theres a sly subversion to Away We Go the Sam Mendes (American Beauty) road comedy written by novelists Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida. Burt (John Krasinski funny and sweet) and Verona (Maya Rudolph droll and sentimental) make comically uneasy tour guides through an America of liberal parenting and a ""Me Generation"" run amok. With each city they visit each family they catch up with they find more behaviors to avoid more reasons to add responsibility to lives that havent had a lot up until now. Her parents are dead but his (the hysterical Jeff Daniels and Catherine OHara) are the first clue.""Were moving to Belgium""No thought about the grandkid-to-be. ""Its ALWAYS been OUR dream""Burt and Verona travel to Arizona where her former colleague (Allison Janney a stitch) shows off the boozy laissez-faire parenting model. ""Away to Madison"" Wisconsin where Burts friend Ellen (Maggie Gyllenhaal) has changed her name to ""LN"" and dabbles in a ""continuum home"" (everybody in the same bed) with a ""No separation no sugar no strollers"" ethos. But there are poignant moments mixed with the wacky a sadness that underlies the sprawling multi-ethnic family of friends in Montreal a brother in Miami whose wife left him with a daughter sure that this selfish act means shell ""never fit in.""Krasinski (The Office) and Rudolph (formerly of Saturday Night Live) make a complementary couple. He gets the big comic meltdown she delivers the wistful touches.The writers arent bound to any road comedy conventions nor are they shy about flipping their satiric comedy end over end in its wise and warm third act. Its a bit broad and some of the changes in tone can seem abrupt. But Away We Go makes a nice metaphor for a rootless self-involved culture of parents trying to get it right and getting all the wrong advice as they do.

Artificial slope to open at Buck Hill this fall next Movies 47826927 Movie review Pregnant pause with Away We Go But the story of ""Away We Go"" (like its protagonists) meanders aimlessly through quirkytown.  |  1/2 out of 4 stars By Colin Covert Star Tribune June 12 2009 -- 1201pm Photo provided Away We Go Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Away We Go"" feels like notes toward a draft of a screenplay. Most of the necessary material is there. We have our protagonists -- a rootless pregnant couple feeling their way into the world of adult responsibility. Plot Theyre scouting the best environment to raise their child by visiting family members and friends. Tone Indie-quirky-cutesy-hip. Structure That old reliable road-movie configuration. Symbolism A sickly ""family"" tree decorated with plastic fruit. Eccentric minor characters Check. If you could assemble films from a shopping list this would be a reasonable start. And yet as the ambivalent pair visit Miami Montreal and elsewhere in search of their destiny nothing resembling a fleshed-out movie emerges. Husband-and-wife novelists Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida who wrote the screenplay work diligently to master their new medium but from the clunky chapter-by-chapter presentation onward they score only intermittently. By my count two episodes succeed and half a dozen fall flat. Your mileage may vary. After the sturm und drang of ""Revolutionary Road"" director Sam Mendes opted for a looser lighter story and assembled a fine cast. As the questing couple towering John Krasinski as Burt and beach ball-bellied Maya Rudolph as Verona are a visual joke. They look like an exclamation point and a period out for a stroll. Theyre an unlikely couple but then what couple isnt? He wears the bemused smile of a man hoping for the best. She haunted by her parents deaths years earlier looks perpetually worried. His defining character trait is his repeated declaration that he will always love her even if it takes like months for her to lose her baby weight. I never got a solid sense of whats in their heads maybe because these not-grown-up characters havent decided yet. Comedy champs Jeff Daniels and Catherine OHara fare better as Burts blithely selfish unhelpful parents a couple so cluelessly ego- absorbed that they dont register that other people have feelings to hurt. Allison Janney shoots Roman-candle sparks as a brassy harebrained co-worker of Veronas so inappropriate in her parenting that her kids may as well sign up for preemptive psychotherapy. Good as Janney is Maggie Gyllenhaal tops her in a performance that has Best Supporting Actress stenciled across it in gold-leaf lettering. She plays a childhood friend of Krasinskis who has parlayed a trust fund and a penchant for loopy gender-theory pronouncements into a faculty position at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. She is insufferably condescending and laugh-your-pants-off funny as she prattles on about sexual lessons to be learned from ""the seahorse community"" and rails against the insidious influence of baby strollers. ""I love my babies"" she announces. ""Why would I want to push them away from me?"" AWAY WE GO  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating R for language and some sexual content. Theater Uptown. While the film is amusing in short bursts and boasts some sharp dialogue its weak on plot and drama. Long loooong stretches are devoted to instructing us that raising children is no job for neurotic perfectionists. With its hand-drawn main titles and wincingly twee attitude ""Away We Go"" comes off as a contrived attempt to jump on the ""Juno"" bandwagon. It falls right off again.

Media San Francisco Chronicle Away We Go Comedy-drama. Starring John Krasinski and Maya Rudolph. Directed by Sam Mendes. (R. 98 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) A young couple is having an intimate conversation and one says to the other ""No one is in love like us right? Its so weird. What are we gonna do?"" Shes pregnant. He doesnt have much of a job and theyre going to various cities in North America trying to figure out where they should settle and raise their child. In essence thats the whole story of ""Away We Go"" - a couples search for a place to set down roots. The movie is arranged as a series of vignettes in which the two arrive in a new location meet up with the one friend or relative they know in town and get a feel for the life available to them. But its probably in that moment when one says ""No one is in love like us right?"" that audiences will decide whether theyre liking ""Away We Go"" or just tolerating it. The line is intended to function in two ways 1) To make us realize that these two have a deep and unique bond; and 2) To make us see them as a bit like every other couple who has ever had something beautiful together. The moment invites everyone watching who is in love or has ever been in love to feel a connection with this young couple. The problem with the moment and with ""Away We Go"" as a whole is that nothing about the relationship it depicts seems special or beautiful. If anything Burt and Veronas interaction is singular in its lack of joy. They have no delight in each other. Burt (John Krasinski) has an upbeat demeanor but it feels forced as if hes trying to head off or compensate for his girlfriends sourness. And Verona (Maya Rudolph) is cold ungiving and pessimistic. Rudolph takes the note that Verona has had a tragedy in her past and chooses to play Verona as perpetually grim. This is hardly a relationship for an audience to invest emotion in. Yet that investment is absolutely essential because without it ""Away We Go"" becomes a series of scattered parts. Theres no narrative tension in Dave Eggers and Vendela Vidas screenplay just the question ""What will become of Burt and Verona?"" The moment the audience starts thinking ""Who cares about Burt and Verona?"" is the moment the film is in trouble. ""Away We Go"" is directed by Sam Mendes (""Revolutionary Road"") and its a departure both in scale and ambition. Its healthy for directors to try new things if only to stay fresh and develop their skills just as its probably a good idea for respected prose writers such as Eggers and Vida to write a screenplay now and again. ""Away We Go"" comes with a pedigree thats undeniable but this time the filmmakers benefit from the experience and the audience barely breaks even. With the central relationship a vacancy at the movies core ""Away We Go"" is made watchable by the vivid characters that Burt and Verona encounter in their travels. Maggie Gyllenhaal is very funny as an old friend of Burts an unbearable woman who hides her towering hostility even from herself behind a veil of New Age piety. And Chris Messina an intelligent versatile actor brings a fullness of spirit to the role of an adoptive father and loving husband. Sprinkled throughout are moments - some wise some funny some full of feeling - and shots evocative of the grand emotion that keeps eluding the films grasp. One can almost feel the movie ""Away We Go"" might have been if only we could believe that Verona loves Burt - or understand why Burt loves Verona. -- AdvisoryThis film contains strong language sex talk and scenes involving sexuality in action.

Smarter than your average slacker set - with a hint of fairy tale Add to ... Liam Lacey From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Thursday Jun. 11 2009 328PM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 319PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Away We Go Directed by Sam Mendes Written by Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida Starring John Krasinski and Maya Rudolph Classification 14A As its title suggests Away We Go has a hint of fairy tale about it an allegorical quest story along the lines of Jack and the Beanstalk or Pinocchio . English director Sam Mendes leaves behind his portentous stylized dramas ( American Beauty  Revolutionary Road ) for a loose road movie shot by indie cinematographer Ellen Kuras ( Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind ) with a folkie Alexi Murdoch soundtrack adding to its hippy off-road sensibility. The film was written by the thirtysomething novelist-couple Dave Egger and Vendela Vida and the characters self-conscious dialogue may not be to every taste. But theres something genuinely exploratory and original here in the depiction of people being pushed into adulthood before theyre ready. The protagonists are a couple in their early thirties Burt (John Krasinski of The Office ) and Verona ( Saturday Night Live s Maya Rudolph) who are expecting a baby and living in a shack in Colorado. When Burts parents announce they are moving to Europe a month before the babys birth Burt and Verona initially feel abandoned and then recognize an opportunity to reinvent their lives. They decide to hit the road on a trip in search of the perfect place to raise their child. The idea is less a fantasy than a credible possibility Burt sells insurance options over the phone and Verona is a medical illustrator so where they live is optional. How to live is the part that has to be figured out. As with most big life decisions Burt and Verona have an easier time figuring out what they dont want. The roster of bad examples of parenthood starts with Burts own family. Jeff Daniels plays his father presumably an academic or scientist who has just landed a gig in Belgium and has no further thoughts of his offspring. His mother Gloria (Catherine OHara) is insensitive and full of loud cheer. Shes the first of a series of scary strident maternal figures who serve as counterexamples for Verona. Away Burt and Verona go then first to Phoenix to visit Veronas former colleague Lily (Allison Janney) whose initial boisterousness grows weirder over the course of a day. Shes a drunk with a history of mental illness who ridicules her taciturn kids and rolls her eyes at the apocalyptic fantasies of her sullen husband (Jim Gaffigan). Their next stop is Madison Wis. where they visit a childhood friend of Burts now a womens studies professor Ellen (a broad performance by Maggie Gyllenhaal) who prefers the gender-neutral L.N. But the progressive academic proves as crazy as the middle-class conservatives in Phoenix with a hard-line rule against strollers and a belief in the whole family sharing the family bed for every kind of activity. Not everyone the couple meet is quite as appalling. Theres an interlude where Verona visits her beautiful younger sister Grace (Carmen Ejogo) in Tucson and they talk about the deaths of their parents a dozen years before. In Montreal they see college friends (Chris Messina and Melanie Lynskey) - a smart loving couple with a multiracial family of adopted children though their harmony is marked with a seam of pain. Then in mid-journey Burt and Verona are called away to Miami for a crisis involving his brother Courtney (Paul Schneider) a doting dad facing the prospect of single parenthood. Away We Go is the sort of movie that wavers segment by segment - some scenes are gently moving others too glib - but over all Krasinski and Rudolph make a convincing uncertain young couple a bit smarter than the usual slacker set. As fans of The Office know Krasinski specializes in projecting endearing geekiness which is what he offers again here. The real revelation is Rudolph. The veteran SNL cast member is a passable comic but it turns out a first-rate actress and the emotional honesty of her performance is the movies best counterbalance to its sometimes too-deliberate wryness.

"Away We Go Road trip in a broken-down vehicle | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsAway We Go Road trip in a broken-down vehicle""Burt are we screw-ups?"" Maya Rudolphs worried Verona asks in earthier language near the start of Away We Go  addressing her docile boyfriend played by John Krasinski.An in-flight movie would be more entertaining than Sam Mendess awkward Away We Go starring John Krasinski and Maya Rudolph.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. June 12 2009 Away We Go (out of 4) Starring John Krasinski and Maya Rudolph. Directed by Sam Mendes. 97 minutes. At the Scotiabank Varsity theatres. 14A ""Burt are we screw-ups?"" Maya Rudolphs worried Verona asks in earthier language near the start of Away We Go addressing her docile boyfriend played by John Krasinski.Alas if only it were that simple. Screw-ups we can handle at least in comedic terms. Their quest for redemption can be humorous and even enlightening.But these birds are something else altogether and it aint the least bit funny or insightful. As accidental parents-to-be who have been delaying maturity into their mid-30s while contemplating their navels in their Colorado love shack Verona and Burt are the two most narcissistic nincompoops to fall off the lumber truck in a long while.And theyre actually the best things about this highly episodic movie which is populated with various iterations of the parents from hell. Vacuous Verona and bumbling Burt at least have good hearts and genuine chemistry; most of the people theyre about to meet on their twee road trek are hateful or pathetic cardboard creations.They include Burts parents (Jeff Daniels and Catherine OHara) who callously respond to news of their impending first grandchild by announcing theyre immediately selling the house and moving to Belgium.Bruised by this lack of family kinship and unencumbered by real jobs Burt and Verona absurdly opt to travel across North America searching for a town where a couple might raise a kid in peace love and harmony. Its clearly not Phoenix Ariz. where Veronas former co-worker (Allison Janney) is busily abusing her husband and children with outrageously cruel and vulgar putdowns.Nor is it Madison Wisc. where a self-righteous childhood pal of Burts (Maggie Gyllenhaal) and her pony-tailed boy toy (Josh Hamilton) love the Earth but despise humanity.Further excursions to Montreal Miami and elsewhere yield other damaged goods including a sad momma wannabe who acts out her grief over multiple miscarriages by taking up pole dancing.No matter how far and wide Burt and Verona travel with their miraculous source of moolah its clear that all of these people reside in Quirkville that mythical movie town beloved by indolent screenwriters and deluded directors. Away We Go is dead-end Quirkville penned by real-life couple Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida successful authors taking an unfortunate wrong turn into movie writing.The film is directed by Sam Mendes and here I have to ask my own worried question What the hell happened? The British helmer who so carefully heard the shuddering of Americas soul in such thoughtful works as American Beauty and Jarhead seems to have developed a cloth ear in his first stab at comedy.Hes equally deaf to the inanity of his soundtrack which is heavy with the granola grooves of sensitive Scots singer-songwriter Alexi Murdoch.

Video by Focus Features>> LAUNCH VIDEO PLAYER Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 12 2009 Jean-Paul Sartre famously quipped that hell is other people. But any legal guardian of school-age children will offer the following slightly refined correction Hell is other parents. This StoryRites of Delayed PassageAmbling Away From Lifes UncertaintiesAway We GoMovieMakers John Krasinskis Nice Guys Finish FirstFind Away We Go Showtimes TicketsSummer Movie GuideView All Items in This StoryView Only Top Items in This Story Other parents nag and brag hector and lecture compare and contrast to invidious excess. Other parents spawn those snooty Queen Bees and bossy Mini-Mes. Those ""My Kids an Honor Student"" bumper stickers? Other Parents. Little League Bleacher Screamers? Other Parents. People who silently judge people who put ""Honor Student"" bumper stickers on their cars or get a little worked up at baseball games? Other Parents. Burt and Verona the newly pregnant mid-30s couple at the center of the oddball sneakily self-congratulatory comedy ""Away We Go"" dont want to be Other Parents. The problem is theyre not exactly sure what kind of parents they do want to be. As the movie opens Burt (John Krasinski) and Verona (Maya Rudolph) find out that Veronas going to have a baby in a scene that manages to combine frank sexuality and utter banality. When they travel from their small featureless house to celebrate the news with Burts parents (Catherine OHara and Jeff Daniels) they discover to their dismay that the expectant grandparents plan to move to Europe a month before the baby is born. Their visions of a close supportive extended family thus upended Burt and Verona decide to light out for a new place to live (Burt who sells insurance derivatives entertains fantasies of giving his son or daughter an ""epic Huck Finn-y"" childhood). The implication as they travel from Phoenix to Tucson to Madison to Montreal is that when they finally choose a place to settle down theyll finally define themselves. Written by Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida and directed by Sam Mendes ""Away We Go"" plays like a picaresque ode to the young and ambivalent and will no doubt appeal to readers of the hip literary journals McSweeneys and The Believer which Eggers and Vida respectively founded. (Theyre also a couple in real life.) Buoyed by a lyrical happy-sad soundtrack by the Scottish singer-songwriter Alexi Murdoch and infused with a wry sense of ironic detachment this is a movie that lopes along at its own quiet quirky pace. In not just accepting but celebrating mid-life ambivalence ""Away We Go"" feels like a particularly welcome respite from the false happily-ever-afters that pass for couples stories in most mainstream movies. That appeal is heightened by its two stars. Prime-time alterna-heartthrob Krasinski might have donned a bushy beard and glasses to banish all thoughts of Jim the character he plays on ""The Office"" but the two men are essentially the same. The voice Burt assumes to talk to his insurance clients on the phone isnt that different from the persona Jim takes on to sell paper at Dunder Mifflin. Rudolph is more a cipher playing Verona as if shes harboring a secret that she dares her co-stars and the audience to ferret out. We know that the death of Veronas parents is a big deal and has something -- or more likely everything -- to do with why she adamantly refuses to marry Burt. Shes bi-racial which isnt an issue except when it is like when another character makes a patronizing remark about ""your people."" But for the most part Verona is a passive if warmly sympathetic mirror to the people that she and Burt encounter on their road trip. And its precisely in these vignettes that ""Away We Go"" begins to feel less like an authentic journey of discovery than a nasty solipsistic condemnation of the very community the couple pretends to be searching for. No one it turns out is good enough for Burt and Verona -- surely not the loud-mouthed monster-mother they visit in Arizona (played in a thankless performance by Allison Janney) and not the burlesque of holier-than-thou liberalism they meet up with in Wisconsin (Maggie Gyllenhaal). The family Burt and Verona relate most strongly to -- a beatific multi-cultural brood in Montreal -- turns out to deliver ""Away We Gos"" most absurd and offensive message wherein adoption is portrayed as a second-best substitute for the gold standard of biological reproduction. Much like the couple in ""Revolutionary Road"" Mendess last movie Burt and Verona practice the same brand of exceptionalism that sends countries into wars marriages into crisis and children into lifelong therapy. It turns out that ""Away We Go"" has a happy ending every bit as synthetic as the middlebrow entertainments its protagonists no doubt despise in this case with a resolution the couple had in their too-hip pockets all along. Fittingly enough the final shot of the movie features Burt and Verona alone with their backs to the audience and by extension the world. Ready finally to become someone elses idea of hell. Away We Go (98 minutes at Landmarks E Street and Bethesda Row) is rated R for profanity and some sexual content. >> This StoryRead +|Watch +| Comments (c) 2009 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends Activity View More Activity  Rites of Delayed Passage Ambling Away From Lifes Uncertainties John Krasinskis Nice Guys Finish First Find Away We Go Showtimes Tickets Summer Movie Guide Away We Go",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/11/AR2009061104065.html,200,awaywego13,awaywego,washingtonpost

But the expectant parents are looking for a physical rather than metaphysical place to raise their daughter. A place that lives up to their crunchy Huck Finn-y ideals of America and parenthood.Based on an original screenplay by Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida Sam Mendes road movie follows the couple as they test the soil of Phoenix; Tucson Ariz.; Madison Wis.; Montreal and Miami. Which city is most hospitable to a new family putting down roots? And in any of them can they escape the decanted whine of singer/songwriter Alexi Murdoch that floods the sound track?Burt is in insurance; Verona is a medical illustrator. With a fax and a phone they can live anywhere. They are the fulfillment of the dream of Revolutionary Road last years Mendes dramathon about the pair who hoped to escape the prison of American suburbia by moving to Paris.In that one the marrieds hope a change of external place will change their internal dissatisfaction. In this one the unmarrieds hope that a change of external place near friends or relatives will make them feel more secure.In the course of their oddball odyssey across North America Burt and Verona personify the longing for ancestral home in a generation where families are dispersed. ""Where should we live?"" is the pretext for the more critical questions ""How should we live"" and ""Whom are we living for?"" Some of the friends they visit - an overgrown party girl played to a brittle hilt by Alison Janney and a feminazi played with laid-back authoritarianism by Maggie Gyllenhaal - have blazed paths Burt and Verona definitely do not want to follow.The unassuming performances by Krasinski and Rudolph help make this the first Mendes movie that feels lived-in rather than staged. As opposed to that canned feeling of American Beauty and Road to Perdition the combination of their naturalistic acting and Ellen Kuras light-filled cinematography fills Away We Go.Even so Mendes may have too sharp a sensibility for Eggers and Vidas shaggy script. As Mendes somewhat cynically frames the film Burt and Verona are nicely drawn sympathetic figures in a film where virtually everyone else (except the radiant Carmen Ejogo and gloomy Paul Schneider) is caricatured and aggressively unsympathetic.Still even when I didnt believe in the awfulness of Away We Gos subsidiary characters I believed in Burt and Verona.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

Away We Go Director Sam Mendes. Cast John Krasinski Maya Rudolph Allison Janney. Rating R for language and some sexual content. Note At Harkins Camelview 5. Great Good Fair Bad Bomb Related Maya Rudolph goes home for Away We Go Summer movies give unsung stars a chance to shine Away they go A chat with Eggers and wife That makes some sense. Both are directed by Sam Mendes and as Krasinski points out theyre inverse images ""Revolutionary Road"" is about a search for happiness by a man and woman who dont love each; ""Away"" is about a man and woman seeking much the same thing but who do love each other. But theres a problem with this exercise. For one it would mean suffering through ""Revolutionary Road"" as depressing a film experience as one could imagine. For another while ""Away We Go"" is a better film its not exactly a non-stop barrel of laughs; a double bill might be too much to take. Krasinski plays Burt a happy-go-lucky sort whose girlfriend Verona (Maya Rudolph) is pregnant. (We learn this in the first scene in what must be the most unconventional manner ever.) A visit to Burts self-involved parents (Jeff Daniels and Catherine OHara) reveals that theyre moving out of the country so whatever help with the baby Burt and Verona were hoping for will leave with them. Panicked the parents-to-be embark upon a road trip visiting friends and family members around the country looking for a place they might call home; on the way they attempt to find themselves as well. First stop Phoenix where they check in on Veronas former co-worker Lily (Allison Janney) and her family. Lilys an absolute loon saying whatever comes to mind. Everyone they visit in fact has some sort of overdone idiosyncrasy that sets off alarms. Childhood friend LN - say it out loud - is a militant New Ager railing against such evil devices as strollers (""Why would you push the baby away from you?""); if you doubted such a creature existed Maggie Gyllenhaals hilarious creepy performance may convince you otherwise. The most interesting thing about Burt and Veronas relationship is its status. Veronas parents are dead so although she loves Burt she is adamant that they will never marry because her mother cant see it happen. In fact that word - ""never"" - carries the most weight and power of any in the film. Many expecting couples experience doubts and fears but Veronas threaten to consume her. Rudolph a ""Saturday Night Live"" veteran has great comic chops (as does Krasinski; see ""The Office"") but here shes relentlessly downbeat. The acting is good but its ultimately exhausting for the audience; one shudders to think what things must be like for poor Burt. Mendes working from a script by husband-and-wife hipsters Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida ends things in a vaguely haunting way without really resolving them which is a good thing. Home is where you find it and life is full of doubts for Burt and Verona and the rest of us as well. Reach Goodykoontz at 602- 444-8974 or bill.goodykoo ntzarizonarepublic.com.

Her performance as a pregnant medical illustrator living in Colorado with an insurance salesman portrayed by John Krasinski of ""The Office"" reminds you just how interesting an eternal supporting player can be given the opportunity. The script uses its central couple as both observers and participants in a loosely constructed series of vignettes the early ones built for caricature the later ones for pathos. The script comes from Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida who are married in real life. Their screen couple exists in an arch comic realm of nearly superhuman niceness. Verona (Rudolph) and Burt (Krasinski) are introduced in bed in a very funny opening scene that finds a new way to deliver age-old plot information. A few months into the pregnancy the couple figures life is settled for the near-term. Theyll stay in their little corner of Colorado not far from Burts parents (Catherine OHara and Jeff Daniels). Then out of the blue the parents announce theyre moving to Belgium. Now what? Where is home exactly if most of your friends and all of your family live elsewhere? Visiting a variety of casual friends and relatives Verona and Burt bounce from Phoenix to Tucson to Madison to Montreal with late detours to the southeastern corner of the country. Montreal looks like heaven compared with the blowhards littering the lower 48 though their old college pals in Montreal have known their share of heartbreak. Director Sam Mendes smooths out any sign of tension between Verona and Burt while letting his supporting cast get away with murder--often enjoyable murder but murder nonetheless. In the Phoenix scenes Allison Janney as Veronas blowsy former employer swings for the fences and mugs like a fiend. In Madison playing a drowsily sensual university professor Maggie Gyllenhaal brings a vaguely sinister quality to a woman whos breast-feeding her kids far beyond the usual cut-off point and whose parenting philosophy does not allow for the use of strollers. Some of this is funny; all of it is designed to stoke fear and doubt in the hearts of our deadpan sweethearts. Mendes tends to shoot movies like a dispassionate anthropologist examining bizarre modes of behavior from an emotional distance. Ive admired much of his film work but from the beginning with ""American Beauty"" hes never been one to defuse the smugness in a smug script. (So far none of his movies has come close to his achievements as a stage director.) I enjoyed much of the dialogue in ""Away We Go"" but in their pursuit of happiness Verona and Burt remain attractive outlines. And do we really need quite so much of singer/songwriter Alexi Murdochs sensitive murmurings on the soundtrack? Watch what Rudolph does however. Krasinski gets a fair share of laughs in ""Away We Go"" but when required to register a couple of emotions at once you can sense him trying to figure out precisely how to do it. With his co-star you never feel the strain or calculation. Shes funny too. Rudolphs touch is very sure. Even when limited by her material she fills in the details often wordlessly and gives us someone worth caring about.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor June 5 2009 Save for later Saved Maya Rudolph left and John Krasinski are shown in a scene from ""Away We Go."" Francois Duhamel/Focus Features/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of ""Away We Go"" seems like a movie out of time which is not the same thing as timeless. With few alterations it could pass for a movie from the early 1970s. A road-trip odyssey it fobs off nonconformity as a spiritual virtue. Its a hippie movie for the 21st century.The problem is the best hippie movies - like say ""Alices Restaurant"" - were not as relentlessly engineered as ""Away We Go"" which was written by husband-and-wife alt-lit icons Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida. Sam Mendes who directed is renowned for such hypercontrolled diagrammatic movies as ""American Beauty"" and ""Revolutionary Road."" His work here is much more wayward and (seemingly) improvisatory than usual but finally the film is a species of screed. Instead of taking it out on the soulless suburbs as in those other two films Mendes is indicting just about everywhere else. High or low urban or the sticks anomie is still anomie.John Krasinski and Maya Rudolph play Burt and Verona a rural Colorado couple expecting their first child. When his parents (played risibly by Jeff Daniels and Catherine OHara) unexpectedly announce that they are moving to Belgium Burt and Verona decide to hit the road in search of a better place to live and bring up their baby. (Conveniently both are freelancers - he sells insurance over the phone shes a medical illustrator - with no need for a permanent address. In hippie movies income is never a big issue.) Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Gawky hirsute Burt is meant to be lovably childlike but he seemed kind of stunted to me. (Krasinski is miscast.) Verona is far more level-headed at least compared with him. Their first stop is Phoenix where they hook up with a former co-worker of Veronas Lily (Allison Janney) and her husband (Jim Gaffigan). Two more obnoxious individuals you will search far and wide to find. Janney is remarkable in the role but Lilys hysterical high spirits are an indictment. They personify the soullessness of hickdom. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review Away We Go In Tucson the couple meet up briefly with Veronas remarkably sane sister (Carmen Ejogo) - how did Tuscon escape the scourge? - before moving on to Madison Wis. Burts childhood friend Ellen (a pitch-perfect Maggie Gyllenhaal) is a Womens Studies professor who now calls herself LN; her common-law husband Roderick (Josh Hamilton) a liberated guy loves male sea horses because they carry babies in their brood pouches. LN and Roderick allow their little son to share their bed. Did I say ""Away We Go"" is a neohippie movie? It is but of a special sort. The filmmakers serve up a poisonous portrait of these superannuated hippies in order to establish Burt and Verona as the real deal.The Montreal segment where Burt and Verona indulge in melancholy good times with a married pair of former college classmates (well played by Chris Messina and Melanie Lynskey) and their rainbow coalition of adopted kids appears to be in the movie for its own sweet sake. Thats why I liked it. (I also like the fact that nothing in the movie is made of Burt and Veronas mixed-race partnership.) I realize Mendes probably intended the Montreal sequence as a cautionary tale for his two parents-to-be but thats not how it comes across. Its too full of the juices of real life for that.In the end ""Away We Go"" is highly sentimental (as hippie movies invariably are). Its about finding a place to belong in a world that doesnt make it easy and its also about the almost hallucinatory anxiety of becoming a parent. Good subjects weak payoff.The films one extraordinary aspect which makes it well worth seeing despite its carefully coiffed shagginess is Maya Rudolphs performance. For those who only know her from her comic sketches on ""Saturday Night Live"" her work here will come as a revelation (although her brief but marvelous work in Robert Altmans ""A Prairie Home Companion"" where she really was pregnant should have been a tip-off). She has an emotional honesty here that most performers never achieve in a lifetime. Shes a major actress. Now she needs a major movie. Grade B- (Rated R for language and some sexual content.)

(Francois Duhamel/Focus Features via Associated Press) By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / June 12 2009 Email| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + ""Away We Go"" is a road movie for idealists. Verona and Burt (Maya Rudolph and John Krasinski) cross the continent in pursuit of the perfect place to raise their unborn baby. Among other cities they try Tucson Phoenix and Montreal hoping one of them feels right enough to stay. Each location introduces a friend or relative of varying emotional stability and promises an opportunity for situation comedy situation melodrama or during a stop in Madison Wis. both. ""Away We Go"" left me in a situation too.Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida the Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward of the literary journal universe (he of McSweeneys both of the Believer) wrote this film which the Englishman Sam Mendes of ""American Beauty"" and ""Revolutionary Road"" directed. And in tone and plotting ""Away We Go"" feels like a fairy tale built on an aggravating collection of attitudes. Its condescending judgmental righteous yet sincerely searching. Its also the very rare American movie about men and women in their 30s - intelligent articulate appreciably lifelike people; people with insecurities and volition and a sense of humor.An entire generation of directors and writers is passing through their adult youth sucking their thumbs and staring at the navels of their teenage selves in movies like ""Adventureland"" and ""Lymelife."" They go to work in Judd Apatows hormone factory which cranks out hypersensitive male nostalgia comedies about a strain of permanent adolescence. Those movies as pleasurable as some of them are feel only loosely connected to the actual world. No one begrudges Wes Anderson David Gordon Green or Spike Jonze their dioramas sand castles and microcosms but it would be nice for their worlds to meet ours.At the very least ""Away We Go"" acknowledges passage into a rite of adulthood. The usual Sturm und Drang of balls chains and sacrifice of marital regrets and misgivings doesnt happen. Verona and Burt arent asking what kind of grown-ups they want to be. Theyre wondering what sort of a mom and dad theyll make. That parental existentialism gives the movie moments of beauty mostly when the couple are lying around thinking aloud once on a trampoline in Miami exchanging child-rearing vows. (She refuses to actually marry him in part because her deceased parents wouldnt be able to attend the wedding.)The problem with the movie is how its rigged for them to arrive at their conclusion. Verona and Burts North American tour turns up a collection of role models dubious enough for them to feel better about themselves. They begin with Catherine OHara and Jeff Daniels as Burts rambunc tious parents. Three months before the baby is born theyve decided to hightail it to Belgium even though Verona and Burt moved into a nearby woodsy shack to be closer to them. In Phoenix theyre attacked by Allison Janney playing a bawdy deeply tanned former co-worker of Veronas named Lily. Lily is an insult machine mocking her kids (Conor Carroll and Samantha Pryor) and stifling her husband (Jim Gaffigan) with her exuberant negativity. In Madison dinner with Burts cousin (Maggie Gyllenhaal) a hippie New-Agey womens studies professor and her husband (Josh Hamilton) turns into the sort of horror-show clash of personalities you once could find with great regularity on ""Wife Swap.""All of these women are underminers. More than one of them makes a casual racial put-down regarding Veronas being black. Their comments seem forced to cast the offenders in a bigoted light to remind folks who dont know that Rudolph is indeed black and to laugh at a certain type of progressive liberal.Many of these scenes are torn between real farcical comedy and an annoying self-congratulation designed to make Verona and Burt appear more virtuous and together than these nut cases. But the women playing the shrews and loudmouths are full of comic zest. OHara speaks at exhilarating gale force. Janney looks like a leather sofa that squawks and snorts yet still manages to be an impressive piece of furniture. And Gyllenhaal resembles some indomitable woman from one of those John Currin mock-Renaissance portraits. They embarrass Krasinski and Rudolph putting her especially in the unfortunate position of having to use primness to convey goodness.Rudolph spent years on ""Saturday Night Live"" alongside Tina Fey and Amy Poehler. They were the Supremes of sketch comedy (Ill let you argue over who was Diana Ross). Here she sits and watches the other actors freak out and melt down. Veronas stability is meant to demonstrate strength but a woman determined to spend her life with a goofball like John Krasinski ought to show some evidence of a lunatic streak. When Rudolph reads a childrens story in a funny voice all you can think is ""Where did that come from?""Of course going bananas would not have been the only way to play this material. Verona and Burts trip to Montreal turns up Melanie Lynskey and Chris Messina two underappreciated actors as a pair of old college friends whove adopted a multiracial gaggle of happy kids. The parents have suffered tragedy and Lynskey dramatizes sadness and dysfunction with quiet moving physicality. That characters whole life is there in her long face and drooping limbs. Its the best performance in the movie.Mendes does almost everything right with ""Away We Go"" which is a relief after watching him do almost everything wrong with ""Revolutionary Road"" where willful museum-ready staging suffocated even the marital cliches. This new movie is looser and less oppressively styled than anything Mendes has tried before. He likes all the feral female energy.The movie is like one of David O. Russells manic ranging comedies (""Flirting With Disaster"" ""I Heart Huckabees"") but it doesnt have enough of Russells keen screwball surprise or human generosity. Mendes cant entirely surmount the smugness that pollutes Eggers and Vidas picaresque script either. (Its the same smugness that chokes their books.) This is how you raise a family the movie finally says while remaining blind to not-insignificant matters of upbringing class and community. ""Away We Go"" doesnt celebrate life. Weirdly it champions leaving life behind. Away indeed.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. For more on movies go to www.boston.com/movienation.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 5 2009 333 PM Staggering Quirkiness Away We Go tells the story of two slacker parents-to-be with a screenplay by Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida. By Dana Stevens Maya Rudolph and John Krasinski in Away We Go Away We Go (Focus Features) is like a disappointing term paper by a promising student. The pairing of Sam Mendes as director and novelists Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida as screenwriters seemed like a fine idea. After the overstuffed grandeur of Revolutionary Road Mendes needed a project of just this sort a low-key comedy in the indie mode with no big stars and no Oscar pretensions. And who better to document the wanderings of a creative slacker couple about to become parents than a creative slacker couple who recently did? (Eggers and Vida had a daughter named October in 2005.) Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The premise of the movie seems engaging too. There are so many romantic comedies about men hesitating at the brink of adulthood while women drum their fingers on the other side of the divide. In Away We Go a couples impending parenthood forces both of them to grow up at the same time a model thats more recognizable from real life. The problem is that no one in Away We Go is remotely like anyone in real life. And a good thing too because if I lived among people this self-absorbed and suffocatingly quirky Id go very far away indeed. Advertisement Burt (John Krasinski) and Verona (Maya Rudolph) are in their 30s unmarried and ambivalent--Burts pursuing a career in radio but without conviction while Verona an anatomical illustrator mulls the question of whether to go back to medical school. Theyre not trying to have a baby but theyre not trying not to. When Verona inevitably gets pregnant they move to the city where Burts family comes from only to discover that his flaky parents (Jeff Daniels and Catherine OHara) are about to relocate to Belgium. Burt and Verona decide to take a cross-country trip in search of the right place to settle down and raise their child. In Phoenix they visit Veronas former boss Lily (Allison Janney) a coarse braying harridan who insults her husband and children to their faces and makes a drunken pass at Burt. In Madison Wis. a childhood friend of Burts LN (Maggie Gyllenhaal) makes a self-righteous display of her commitment to ""continuum parenting"" a kind of attachment parenting on steroids. And in Montreal a pair of old college friends (Melanie Lynskey and Chris Messina) reveals the fault line beneath their apparently perfect life. The movies peripatetic structure would feel more like a true journey if Burt and Verona didnt repeat the same experience in every place they visit. Over and over theyre confronted with a negative example of family life a picture of what they dont want to be when they grow up vulgar drunken sluts? Nope. Cloying New Age twits? Definitely not. When they pay an emergency visit to Burts brother (Paul Schneider) whose wife has just abandoned him and their young daughter Burt and Verona agree in a whispered conversation atop a backyard trampoline that child abandonment will not be an option. Isnt that setting the bar a bit low? Who makes moral decisions in this kind of contextless vacuum? And if Burt and Verona really are the reasonably intelligent attractive people they seem to be why dont they have a better assortment of friends to choose from? The secondary roles in Away We Go are all played by skilled actors--Catherine OHara in particular is an unsung genius-- but their characters are so broadly drawn that they dont engage with the lead couple or the audience in any meaningful way. OHaras narcissistic grandmother-to-be and Gyllenhaals passive-aggressive fruitcake are satiric grotesques in a movie that isnt a satire. Although Burt and Veronas cross-country trek amounts to a funhouse ride through a house of parental horrors were meant to take seriously the insights they glean along the way and to believe by movies end that their journey has brought them closer together. When the two leads are alone on-screen they can project a convincing sense of intimacy but their characters motivations remain opaque Theyre two blank slates in love. Maya Rudolph a former cast member of Saturday Night Live deserves credit for her refusal to mug. Her grave still face is one of the few understated things in the movie. And John Krasinski may not have many actorly tricks up his sleeve besides adorable bumbling but hes an admirably proficient bumbler. Perhaps the problem with this collaboration is that Sam Mendes weaknesses as a director line up too perfectly with those of his screenwriters. Mendes is drawn to projects with a broad social scope but his most memorable scenes are stand-alone lyrical moments like the scene in American Beauty in which a plastic bag blows in the wind. The screenplay by Eggers and Vida gives Mendes the opportunity to film many such mini-epiphanies (if anything too many) but never creates characters worth having epiphanies about. The movies conceit is that over the course of their travels Burt and Verona will discover who they are by ruling out what theyre not. But who cares how much they learn about themselves if we never learn anything about them?

"Away We Go - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMOVIE REVIEW Away We GoJohn Krasinski and Maya Rudolph play an endearing couple at the heart of this film but the cast of over-the-top characters around them are more contemptuous than comic.June 05 2009|KENNETH TURAN | FILM CRITIC ""Away We Go"" is a self-satisfied film about insecure people a quirky and episodic comic drama that squanders its genuine assets and ends up not as special as it tries to be.Directed by Sam Mendes (an Oscar winner for ""American Beauty"") from an original script by Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida ""Away We Go"" is graced with an endearing central couple apprehensive about their impending parenthood. Unfortunately most of the other people in the film add to that anxiety by being smugly self-involved and a trial to endure.Counterculture types Burt (""The Offices"" John Krasinski) and Verona (Maya Rudolph of ""Saturday Night Live"") are a longtime unmarried couple who are charmed to be in each others company even if mundane things like replacing broken windows in their Colorado home with glass instead of cardboard seem to be beyond them.But with a child on the way Burt and Verona worry that they havent figured out how to care for themselves believing that at age 34 they are screw-ups (the R-rated film uses a much more graphic term). So when they end up taking a rambling trip across the country to visit old friends and family its not just to decide where to live its also to help figure out how to live.Theres nothing wrong with this as a concept but the way it plays out is problematic. Accompanied by a melodic score by singer-songwriter Alexi Murdoch Burt and Verona are so immediately appealing and good-hearted so obviously right for each other that the whole notion that they worry about being feckless losers comes off as the rank contrivance it very much is.An even bigger difficulty is that ""Away We Go"" in effect builds Burt and Veronas confidence by exposing them to a series of other couples who are mostly such grotesques and gargoyles that our heroes seem sane and responsible by comparison.Thats nice for them but it forces us to endure the shenanigans of people best left unobserved.The whole reason Burt and Verona go on this trip in the first place are because of the antics of Burts parents Jerry and Gloria.As played by Jeff Daniels and Catherine OHara these two are so heroically self-absorbed that they not only decide to leave the country just as their grandchild is about to be born they rent out their house to strangers even though impoverished Burt and Verona are desperate to live there.One of the first people visited is Lily (Allison Janney) an old co-worker of Veronas who now lives in Phoenix and turns out to be a loud and overbearing lush who never misses an opportunity to be as obnoxious as possible.Moving to a different city (Madison Wis.) and a different socioeconomic group Burt and Verona meet up with Burts childhood friend Ellen (Maggie Gyllenhaal) a university faculty member who now refers to herself as LN.Along with her partner Roderick (Josh Hamilton) LN is yet another paragon of pathetic idiocy with a collection of childbearing theories that are both bizarre and deeply held. Case in point is her belief in the efficacy of the three Ss no separation no sugar no strollers. You have no idea.Clearly Lily LN and their ilk are to some extent supposed to be comic relief but they do not play that way. These portraits are more contemptuous than comic filled with enough meanness and mockery deserved or not to make laughter the furthest thing from your mind.To be fair to ""Away We Go"" Burt and Verona do have some nicer visits with more appealing folks but by then the damage has been done. The warmth and goodwill the films protagonists generate on their own is never matched by anything else put on screen and that does feel like a shame.--kenneth.turanlatimes.com--Away We GoMPAA rating R rating for language and some sexual contentRunning time 1 hour38 minutesPlaying At the Arclight in Hollywood and the Landmark in West Los Angeles MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESComic Relief--the NumbersNovember 16 1987Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-away5-2009jun05,0,1990375.story",200,awaywego24,awaywego,latimes

Verona (Maya Rudolph) is 34. They suffer -- or make us suffer -- Severe Whimsy Disorder. Symptoms may include excruciatingly playful dialogue and underemployment. Treat with megadoses of Nick Drake. Their story unfolds or rather puts its feet up and pops a PBR in a script by Dave Eggers and his novelist wife Vendela Vida. Eggers author of the memoir ""A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius"" (or ""How I Nearly Converted Immense Personal Tragedy Into a Starring Gig on The Real World "") was orphaned as a young adult. To misquote Wilde losing both parents can mean making a fortune. Thin though ""Away We Go"" is three sort-of story lines involve losing parents (one set dies another moves away a mom disappears). I cant say what it means to suffer orphanhood at a tender age but in artistic terms it grants Eggers a license to cling to an uncompleted childhood indefinitely. In one scene someone makes important calls while bouncing on a trampoline at midnight. What do Burt and Verona want? A family. Rejected by his parents and hers (who died inconveniently) Burt and the pregnant Verona wander the country like the lost doggies of ""The Incredible Journey"" trying to find people exactly like them so they can nestle down. Leave aside the unlikeliness of a six-months pregnant woman and her guy traveling thousands of miles to visit various near strangers to decide whether they want to move in next door. Forget that such committed alterna-kids would be unlikely to utter the words ""Phoenix"" or ""Tucson"" without shuddering much less associate with foul- and loud-mouthed broads (such as a Phoenix mom played by Allison Janney on loan from ""Juno"" who refers to her breasts as ""jugs"" that used to be nice until her kids ""sucked em dry""). Leave aside the way an earth mother (Maggie Gyllenhaal who wafts Stevie Nicks-ishly through the heath breastfeeding her school-age kids and disavowing strollers because they mean pushing her children away) is so broadly done that Jerry Lewis would have said ""Can we tone it down a little?"" Leave aside the childish wishing scenario in which Burt and Verona are simply handed everything they want without earning it in any way. All of this Id forgive -- if I liked the main characters. Theyre occasionally endearing but they live their lives between quotation marks (you never know whether Burt means anything he says) and dont actually have affirmative personalities. Lots of things freak them out (cool people we are told hate the word ""superb"" in one scene ""robust"" in another) but when it comes time for them to prove how superb and robust they are they dwindle. B. and V. sit side by side at the exact center of the frame as if waiting for Wes Anderson to come film them. Director Sam Mendes (""American Beauty"") fails to make them as beautifully fragile as he wants to. It isnt till the closing moments that Burt and Verona connect beyond the level of remarks about raising a ""Huck Finn-y"" kid. The strange thing about the movie is its idea that such couples are rare flowers. But you can scarcely take a step in Seattle or San Francisco or Los Feliz without meeting them in hordes. If every Burt and Verona departed Brooklyn the place would be so empty you could convert it into cropland or maybe parking lots for Manhattanites. Either way an improvement. AWAY WE GO Juno II The Middle-Age Years. Running time 97 minutes. Rated R (profanity sexual references) At the Lincoln Square and Union Square.

Every so often standards are redefined. ""Gray"" (or white according to the season) ""is the new black."" Or my new favorite - ""Employed is the new rich."" But one that quietly sneaked in a while ago needs to be acknowledged 30 is the new 20. Away We Go (R) Focus (97 min.) Directed by Sam Mendes. With John Krasinski Maya Rudolph. Now playing in New York. TWO AND HALF STARS Rating note The film contains sexual situations strong language and alcohol abuse. Burt and Verona for example are the thirtysomething couple at the heart of the comedy ""Away We Go."" But they act as if they still have mortarboard tassels hanging from their rear-view mirror. Wheres their relationship headed? Their careers? Theyre still making up their lives as they go along. And when all this improvisation leads to an unplanned pregnancy they have a question Where to now? ""Away We Go"" shows them trying to come up with an answer. His parents are moving to Europe; hers are dead. And so the pair sets off on a circuitous road trip auditioning cities - and the friends who live in them - for a place to put down roots. This is the gimmick that drives the script (by hip authors and real-life couple Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida) and I never believed it for a minute. The woman is six-months pregnant? Theyve got a major expensive life-changing event coming up? And theyre both going to put their jobs - and prenatal appointments -- on hold while they schlep around to Wisconsin to Arizona to Florida? It feels like exactly what it is - a device. Just as the characters often feel like what they are - set-ups for jokes. Maya Rudolph eventually adds some depth to Verona but shes too easily angered; as Burt John Krasinski is too much of an overgrown child. Its hard to imagine what this strident woman and immature man ever saw in each other let alone what still binds them - after all its not as if they already had eight kids and a hit reality show. The other characters are even more broadly - or rather thinly - drawn but as strictly comic figures a few of them deliver. Allison Janney for example is clearly having the time of her life playing Veronas old boss a boozy floozy harridan shouting appalling things across public spaces. And Maggie Gyllenhaal wickedly ribs her own groovy-mom image as Ellen - excuse me ""LN"" - a New Age ""womyn"" and parenting fascist. The Gyllenhaal sequence - the film unfolds in chapters complete with titles - is the best. Too often though the script feels - not surprisingly given its provenance - like a small-press collection of short stories with small revelations but no real resolutions. And that title; can anyone over 40 see that and not hear Jackie Gleason? (Then again any movie that starts with a sex act and a joke about personal hygiene is probably going for a different demographic.) The project is admittedly an interesting one for Sam Mendes and undoubtedly a necessary one after the bleak ""Revolutionary Road."" The director makes some unusual choices from using a single composer Alexi Murdoch for the score (until he muffs it by cuing up an ancient George Harrison tune) to choosing for his cinematograpgher indie darling Ellen Kuras who gives these plebian locales an odd alienating feel. But the films final shift toward seriousness in increasingly bleak episodes in Montreal and Florida seems less like a deepening of the theme then a sudden reversal. Nor does the story quite explain why they moved to Colorado to be near Burts grating parents to begin with or why they dont seriously consider living near Veronas only sister. ""Away We Go"" promises a funky emotional road trip and delivers a few funny snapshots. But it takes too many detours tarries too long in nothing-to-do backwaters and finally arrives at a destination that was inevitable from the start.

And even more unusual it achieves this in the context of a road trip. Nimbly directed by Sam Mendes (Revolutionary Road) from a sharply observed and witty screenplay by novelists Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida Away We Go is a movie with memorable and engaging performances. John Krasinski and Maya Rudolph are one of the most appealing and believable screen couples to star in a romantic comedy. Not only do they project terrific chemistry but they adeptly switch between broad comedy and poignancy sometimes in the same scene. This is even more noteworthy because neither has much film experience having both made their names in television comedies --The Office in Krasinskis case and Saturday Night Live for Rudolph. Mendes deserves credit for choosing them as leads and also for the quirky supporting cast. Maggie Gyllenhaal and Allison Janney give hilarious performances in roles that are extreme yet familiar. The premise of this road comedy is the couples journey to several U.S. cities and Montreal in search of the right place to settle and raise the baby they are expecting. Verona (Rudolph) worries that they are screw-ups (she uses another unprintable word) and Burt (Krasinski) tries in his awkwardly charming way to allay her concerns. In their myriad reactions to offbeat behavior and unanticipated situations they come across like a real-life couple even people we might know. The notions of what it takes to raise a family and what constitutes a happy upbringing are explored in subtle and intriguing ways as the pair visit friends and relatives. Should they settle in Phoenix near Lily (Janney) Veronas brashly honest colleague? Or perhaps theyd be better off in a Wisconsin college town near LN (Gyllenhaal) Burts childhood friend with a child-rearing style that is a weird blend of rigid and politically correct? In Montreal they visit college friends with an eclectic and happy family and things seem to be crystallizing. But they are called away on a family matter that makes them delve deeper into complicated feelings. Away We Go is an exploratory and occasionally bittersweet trek that takes unexpected turns and winds up in an emotionally satisfying place.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet One thing parenthood forces on a couple well before the child is even born is the need for certainty. Decisions have to be made and all the twigs on the nest have to be glued together. Being unsettled isnt so bad for young adults who live hand-to-mouth and can afford a few lost years but taking care of a kid requires more than flaky improvisation. Thats the trouble facing John Krasinski and Maya Rudolph in Away We Go a disarming road comedy about parents-to-be looking for a place to call home. Working from a bright keenly observed script by married authors Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida director Sam Mendes (American Beauty Revolutionary Road) embarks on a picaresque journey across North America that isnt nearly as spontaneous as it means to be but remains full of insight about what goes into being a parent. Though they begin the film a little unmoored there isnt a lot of friction between Krasinski and Rudolph who both give relaxed lived-in performances as a couple comfortable with each others quirks. Instead the tension comes from without. After his parents (Catherine OHara and Jeff Daniels) make the unexpected decision to move to Europe a month before the due date Krasinski and Rudolph have nothing keeping them in their cluttered Colorado home. So they check out other cities--like Phoenix where an old work acquaintance (Allison Janney) and her husband (Jim Gaffigan) treat their misshapen kids with terrible apathy or Madison Wisconsin where one of Krasinskis childhood friends (Maggie Gyllenhaal) now a college professor explores the outer limits of alternative parenting. And so it goes with the couple wending through Montreal and Miami getting a strong sense of what to expect when theyre expecting. As the film progresses the straight almost cartoonish comedy of the first few encounters shifts into a subtler more enriching study of parenthood--its joys its surprises and the sheer heartbreaking fragility of the whole enterprise. Though Away We Go lacks the screwball unpredictability of something like Flirting With Disaster it compensates with a unexpected depth of feeling a novelists (or memoirists) sense of detail and a panoramic view of what home means.

(Isasi/AP) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday June 4 2009 1115 AM Title Away We Go If we learn anything from ""Away We Go"" its that a lack of ambition might not be such a bad thing after all.Theres no dismissing the collective pedigree behind this uneven indie offscreen literary couple Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida wrote the screenplay while Oscar-winner Sam Mendes (""American Beauty"") directed.Its just too bad they didnt follow their slacker protagonists example and amble slowly through their cross-country road trip flick. Instead they all labor overtime to mark every stop along the map usually with neon signs and flashing arrows.Still unsure about what they want to be when they grow up thirtysomethings Burt (John Krasinski) and Verona (Maya Rudolph) dont have much time left to decide theyve got a baby on the way. An anxious Verona wants to settle down and build a real home so she plans a trip around the U.S. (and up to Montreal) determined to find their perfect landing spot.Each stop proves quirkier than the last from a goodbye with Burts flaky parents (Catherine OHara Jeff Daniels) to dinner with Maggie Gyllenhaals smugly New Age professor. Allison Janney is the rare supporting actor who transcends the self-conscious wackiness finding some genuine humor in her ridiculous drunk.But even her scene leaves us wondering whether it was really worth the detour. Though the movie seems to take itself seriously overall--the Nick Drake-inspired soundtrack offers consistent clues--the filmmakers regularly sacrifice emotional truths for unearned laughs and easy observations.Burt and Verona do seem to be on a personal journey that were meant to understand and connect with and we want to believe in them at least. But Krasinski keeps himself at an ironic remove staying characteristically likable without becoming truly believable.Rudolph however never loses her way making her luminous stillness the films central asset and grounding force. You cant help but walk away wondering where shell go next. Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Its the comedy of quirkiness in which ""eccentric"" characters are placed ?on screen to inspire an amused whatever shrug -- that little ping of superiority we feel when a petty deluded narcissist is pinned down and wriggling. Away We Go a youngish-couple on-the-road comedy directed by Sam Mendes (Revolutionary Road) from a script by Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida is a gilded entry in the cinema du quirk. Its a movie that invites you all too often to feel superior to the people on screen. Yet its been designed shot and edited with unusual finesse and the two main characters are fresh screen types. Both are brainy leftover-bohemian free spirits and to the extent that the movies condescension echoes their alt-dropout mystique its not just smugness. Its an expression of who they are. Burt (John Krasinski) whos 33 works for an insurance company but treats his job like an imposition the implication being that ?he thinks hes meant for better things. With his ironic geek glasses indie-rock beard and attitude of post-masculine weariness? (hes there to serve and be whimsically grumpy about it) he stands in for a subculture of ""creative"" types who have never gotten over their failure to actually create anything. Burts girlfriend Verona (Maya Rudolph) is pregnant and though shes as directionless as he is she at least knows that theyre treating parenthood as just another chapter of postcollegiate languor. ""Are we f--ups?"" she asks. Yes they are but as they set out to visit their friends and relatives in Arizona Wisconsin Florida and Canada searching for a city to live in they discover something redeeming Everyone they know is even more of a f--up. Jeff Daniels and Catherine OHara play Burts parents as exaggeratedly self-involved ciphers and Allison Janney overacts as? Veronas shrill brash vulgar former colleague. A sequence with Maggie Gyllenhaal as a pious New Age feminist academic is so over-the-top I didnt buy it for a split second. But then in Montreal the film settles down in a scene with Veronas college chums (Chris Messina and Melanie Lynskey) whose rainbow coalition of a family is full of love and hidden pain. For just a bit the prospect of having a child starts to look as magical and as daunting as it should. Krasinski never loses his hip detachment but Rudolph makes Verona in her very lack of direction a creature of furious defiant flesh and blood. She anchors the quirkiness of Away We Go and transcends it too. B?

By David Denby A longing for adventure motivates the new animated feature from Pixar.   Credit Illustration by Bob Staake The recent animated features by the Pixar division of Disney--""The Incredibles"" ""Ratatouille"" ""WALL-E"" and now ""Up""--have amounted to a run of creative success that has few parallels in American popular culture. Yes there was the classic Disney group of animated features released between 1937 and 1942 which included ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" ""Pinocchio"" ""Bambi"" and ""Dumbo."" Children still love them though this aging child doesnt really. The old Disney dispensation went roughly as follows The material was largely based on fairy tales with princes and queens and wicked stepmothers. Animals with long eyelashes engaged in gentle woodland conversation. There was much anthropomorphic charm much sweet melodiousness and running through the sugar a vinegary taste of fear separation punishment. The entire Bruno Bettelheim catalogue of psychological terrors churned below the surface. By now (for me at least) the cloyingness with its malevolent undertones seems too calculated and heavy-spirited. But the recent Pixar films are something else. These movies are fashioned as much for adults as for kids. Set in the modern world they are built around an exhilarating drive for achievement. A family of libertarian superheroes refuses to accept enforced mediocrity (""The Incredibles""). A talented rat wants to practice the art of cooking (""Ratatouille""). A robot saves the aesthetic remnants of a civilization ruined by excess and pollution (""WALL-E""). Some of the characters are isolated; they are all intelligent and strongly motivated. Weve gone from psychological fable to moral fable from fate to something like self-willed even civic passion. ""Up"" which begins in the nineteen-thirties is steeped in the style of that period with its gee-whiz appreciation of exotic adventure and its worship of heroes who have journeyed to strange distant places. A little boy Carl watches newsreels at a theatre and sees an explorer Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer) first celebrated then humiliated no one believes the skeleton of a large flightless bird that Muntz has brought back from South America is authentic. When Carl leaves the theatre he imagines the newsreel narrator describing his walk home turning his stepping over a crack in the sidewalk into a vault over a canyon. Its a gracious moment the co-directors Pete Docter and Bob Peterson who also wrote the screenplay pay affectionate tribute to daydreaming as a noble and necessary human activity. In dreams begin responsibilities and in dreams begin movies too. A little tomboy Ellie (Elie Docter Petes daughter) bursts into Carls world and in a rapid wordless montage we see their long life together--wedded bliss and also painfully the slow extinction of many hopes including a desire that they too will have great adventures in South America. The marital sequence is one of the most moving animated episodes ever made. Its like looking through a family photo album and knowing that every picture represents a crucial moment of experience. The doll-like figures only increase the pathos--Ellie seen deep within the frame becomes smaller and more and more bent as she sweeps their little house. When she dies the elderly Carl now known as Mr. Frederikson (Ed Asner) is left with nothing but a scrapbook called ""My Big Adventure"" which she kept when she was young. Grouchy and cut off--the filmmakers based his snarl and snap on that of a George Booth old guy--he pretends to be more decrepit than he is. When he gets pushed too far however he revolts attaching thousands of helium balloons to his house which is about to be demolished and heads at last for South America. The house takes off but with an unwanted stowaway--a chubby little round-faced Wilderness Explorer in shorts Russell (Jordan Nagai) a version of the youthful Carl. But this boy doesnt need to dream; he just acts rolling into trouble. The never-achieved adventure begins. Carl will renew his ties with his dead wife and embrace the child they never had. ""Up"" is being distributed in both 2-D and 3-D formats. The third dimension lends the characters palpability. Carl has a square blocky head and a blocky body; the boy has a circular face with a bump for a nose. Neither of them is very big but they look solid weighted. When they reach South America they immediately stumble upon the legendary bird--a gorgeous fantasia of purple and red with an enormous beak and the flexibility of an Olympic gymnast. It turns out that Muntz has been there for years hiding out near a gigantic waterfall trying to catch the creature so that he can restore his reputation. He is aided by a pack of dogs with thick damp jowls and snouts. Except for one or two shots however Docter and Peterson never exploit the obvious 3-D opportunity of fangs snapping in the viewers face. Their use of the technology is relatively chaste; theyre not particularly eager to shock us. They keep their eyes on the story and on the bond that develops between Carl and Russell. For the filmmakers 3-D is a narrative tool which works only if what it is enhancing is strong to begin with. After chases and spills and much scurrying over bare mountain buttes an intricate fight unfolds in the sky. On one side are Carl and Russell held aloft in Carls house; on the other Muntz commanding an enormous dirigible. Russell falls out of the house and winds up clinging to some balloons and as he swings from one place to another you can feel the air around him. Airiness has become a medium to pass through not just dead space. Animation may be the perfect place for 3-D. The movie is packed with lovely jokes some of them funny in inexplicable ways. The dogs have been outfitted with little collars that turn their thoughts into words. When Russell reaches down and flips a switch on one collar a dog starts talking in Japanese or Swahili. He flips the switch again and the animal speaks at squeaky double speed like a cartoon chipmunk. The odd surprises never stop. Muntz at the helm of his dirigible is suddenly transfixed by an odd screeching sound--its Russell hanging on to his balloons and dragging his sneakers across the large windows of the airship. The moment is held for what feels like ten seconds. That annoying rubber-on-glass screech a homely sound in the midst of the wildest fantasy brings us back to the genius of the filmmakers. For all their mad inventions they never quite leave the world behind. ""Night at the Museum Battle of the Smithsonian"" is what my mother would have called a kakabarly--a large foaming broth into which she emptied the forlorn and highly miscellaneous contents of her icebox. The plot of this family comedy is nominal; its barely a premise. Ben Stiller is back with his beloved stuffed and wax figures and other statues miniatures and artifacts--only not at the American Museum of Natural History this time but in the basement of the Smithsonian complex (which includes a mockup of the National Gallery) where they have been shipped. After dark the figures come to life and the result is pretty much a free-form traffic jam in which everyone fights everyone else. There are a few fine touches in the chaos some of the paintings spill out of their frames; statues of cherubim fly about; and Stiller and Amy Adams (playing a ready-for-anything Amelia Earhart in red curls) jump into the famous Alfred Eisenstaedt photograph of a sailor kissing a nurse on V-J Day and find themselves in a period black-and-white movie. The scene doesnt mean much of anything but its a handsome piece of magic. The great Hank Azaria also deserves praise as a wannabe pharaoh Kahmunrah. Powerful arms emerging from his battle dress Azaria channelling Boris Karloff speaks in a prissy vaguely English accent and with a lisp. Kahmunrah is an exceptionally huffy wannabe. When people insist on calling his war costume a dress he becomes agitated. ""Its a tunic"" Azaria says irritably shaking his fly-whisk sceptre or nekhakha. ""Tunic."" The British director Sam Mendes (""American Beauty"" ""Road to Perdition"" ""Revolutionary Road"") has at times trapped his American characters in visual and moral schemes that hampered their freedom. In ""Away We Go"" working with a loose and colloquial script written by the husband-and-wife novelists Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida he has gone in the opposite direction Mendes now seems to be happily searching for the countrys idiosyncrasies rather than for its archetypes. The structure is open-ended ruminative rumpled almost in the manner of a road movie from the nineteen-seventies. An intelligent young couple Verona (Maya Rudolph) and Burt (John Krasinski) who are about to have their first baby dont quite know who they are or what they want so they travel around visiting friends and relatives many of whom have children. Some of the episodes are ripely satirical others almost heartbreaking. Allison Janney appears as a coarse drunk who taunts her kids; Maggie Gyllenhaal is a pushy New Age mom whose aggressive virtue saps the strength of everyone around her. The movie could be called a search for an ideal of parenthood and also for a place that the two wanderers exhausted but increasingly sure of themselves can call home.  David Denby has been a staff writer and film critic at The New Yorker since 1998.
