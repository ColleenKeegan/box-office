Standing in for Liam Neeson in the pistol-packin poppa role Kevin Costner juggles the demands of life-threatening cancer a snotty teenage daughter (Hailee Steinfeld) and a multiple assassination assignment from Amber Heards tediously oversexed CIA femme fatale. Its hard to say which of these story strands is the least convincing but our Kev tries his damnedest to take it all seriously as he races around Paris on a girls push bike randomly capping faceless bad guys and scaring off the Frenchies with just a flash of his weapon. Charlies Angels director McG used to know how to marshal a decent action scene (if nothing else) but that touch seems to have deserted him. Psychologists would doubtless have a field day with the films lumpy brew of semi-incestuous paternal angst midlife machismo all-American dick-swinging and moderate racism but we imagine most of them are too busy to waste two hours on this sludge.

By J.R. Jones Jr_Jones 3 Days to Kill 3 Days to Kill  Directed by McG PG-13 113 min. Writer-director Luc Besson hit the jackpot in France with The Professional (1994) starring Jean Reno as a tenderhearted hit man who takes little Natalie Portman under his wing. That same year Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta arrived as lovable killers in Pulp Fiction and since then the assassin has become a cuddlier figure in American movies going back to high school (Grosse Pointe Blank) working out the kinks in a professional marriage (Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith) and shooting the bull (among other things) with a cabbie just a regular guy at heart (Collateral). Couple this with the action cliche of the hero trying to balance job and family and the inevitable result is Bessons latest screenplay 3 Days to Kill. Directed by Joseph McGinty Nichol (thats McG to you) its the farcical emotionally hollow tale of a lifelong CIA killer (Kevin Costner) trying to connect with his estranged teenage daughter (Hailee Steinfeld of True Grit) before he dies of lung cancer. For Gods sake cant we just enjoy people getting shot once in a while? McGs lackluster filmography kicks off with Charlies Angels (2000) and bottoms out with the execrable Terminator Salvation (2009) though his more recent spy-versus-spy farce This Means War (2012) proved he can deliver a good action comedy if hes got a clever script. Unfortunately the best 3 Days to a Kill manages to cough up is the running gag of having tense action scenes interrupted by the dippy ringtone the heros daughter has programmed into his cell phone. The story is pure Bessonian silliness after Ethan Renner (Costner) learns he has only five months to live and quits the CIA a vixenish agency officer (Amber Heard) offers to shoot him up with a life-saving experimental drug if hell take one last assignment hunting down the nefarious Albino (Tomas Lemarquis) and his secret backer the Wolf (Richard Samuel) before they can detonate a suitcase bomb in Paris. Renner and his family live in Paris because--well because Besson lives there I guess but in any case the whole daddy-daughter drama plays out in the City of Light with one semicharming scene in which Renner shows up at school with the gift of a bicycle his daughter rebuffs him and he rides the thing home himself. But the increasingly ludicrous plot undercuts any suspense; when Renner returns to his Paris apartment and finds a Malian family squatting there with a pregnant mother no less he allows them to stay and even bribes one kid to mind the suspect hes got tied up in the bathroom. Every gag is premised on the fact that Renner allows his work and personal lives to overlap--when he collects his daughter from school she can hear his suspect thumping away in the car trunk--though this contradicts everything weve been told about him and would obviously heighten the risk to his loved ones. The comedy doesnt quite square with the mawkish scene late in the proceedings in which Renner teaches his little girl to dance--though as far as the suspense story goes their manuever might be utilized as self-defense causing attackers to barf.

The comeback really started I think in 2010 when he landed a key supporting role in the hard-times economic drama The Company Men. Playing a hard-bitten construction worker with a chip on his shoulder about pampered corporate guys who lose their jobs (like say the movies hero played by Ben Affleck) Costner who really looked like hed gone to seed (paunch jowls thinning hair shorn down to an unflattering buzz cut) used that look -- and his weary-wise contempt -- to communicate what a lifetime of honest hard labor can do to a man. It was a tough little gem of a performance. In 3 Days to Kill he is back in fighting form. Lean and tapered he looks like hes been to the hair specialist and he has basically returned to being a creased version of his old handsome self. Hes 59 now and whatever it took its good to have that Costner back. Now he just has to find a movie worthy of him. 3 Days to Kill was directed by McG the smash-and-grab post-MTV dazzle junkie who made the Charlies Angels films (both of which I liked) and hasnt done much of note since but the movie is based on a story by Luc Besson (who wrote the script with Adi Hasak) and its full of that French filmmakers froufrou pulp sensibility. (Hes Godard crossed with Michael Bay.) The Costner character Ethan Renner is a veteran field operative who finds himself in Paris where hes tapped by a mysterious super-agent named Vivi Delay (Amber Heard) to identify and help assassinate an international marketer of terrorist weapons. The gorgeous Heard shows up in platinum-blonde hair seamed stockings and shiny red lipstick teasing Costner like a dominatrix with a secret crush on him. She might as well be playing one of those post-Tarantino vamp fatales (the wigs the attitude) who kept popping up in bad indie noirs in the late 90s. By this point you think you more or less know what sort of formula 3 Days to Kill is peddling but the movie just gets worse. Ethan it turns out has a teenage daughter (Hailee Steinfeld) who he reunites with after having spent most of her life ignoring her; an ex-wife he lied to about being in the CIA (thats why they separated); an apartment in Paris thats being occupied by a family of lovable squatters from Mali; and a cold that gives him a persistent cough. Did I mention that hes also suffering from brain cancer and has about three months to live? (Unless the experimental cure that Vivi attempts to bribe him with works.) Thats enough extraneous situations to sap the life out of any thriller and 3 Days to Kill turns out to be an incredibly annoying movie in which Costner each time hes about to duct-tape some guys mouth shut has to stop to answer his cell phone which rings with Icona Pops Swedish disco-punk bauble ""I Love It"" (""I Dont Care"") to let him know that his daughter is calling and that he has to take a break from the action to act like a good daddy again. The movie never finds a way to blend the emotional and the rat-a-tat-tat into one seamless package the way that Besson did in his one and only good movie The Professional (1994). Costner grizzled and downbeat escapes with his gruff charisma intact. He plays each scene as if he meant it very straight and cool and with enough vulnerability to show us that hes not hiding behind the macho thrill-kill postures. Hes trying to play a real character and as the Costner comeback continues (next up Hes the general manager of the Cleveland Browns in Ivan Reitmans sports drama Draft Day due in April) lets hope he gets a chance to play more of them. Hes one of the greatest movie stars to arrive after the 1970s and Im convinced that he could be great again. But not with his shoe caught in a pile of merde like 3 Days to Kill.

"3 Days to Kill | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; 3-days-to-kill ) 3 Days to Kill (United States 2014) February 23 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli How did 3 Days to Kill which doesnt have the worst imaginable premise turn out this bad? The problem starts with the screenplay co-credited to Adi Hasak and over-the-top action aficionado Luc Besson. Still although the more serious aspects of the script especially the cliche-riddled fractious father/daughter relationship lack flair the writing on the whole isnt terrible. Besson in particular knows how to mix genres and never takes things too seriously. Its pretty evident he intended 3 Days to Kill to be a comedy thriller. Unfortunately single-moniker director McG (Charlies Angels) didnt get the memo. Sure theres some wacky humor to be found in the final cut. The scenes featuring Amber Heard are weird enough to convey a sense of what Besson was likely going for. However Kevin Costner is so somber and serious that he sucks out any sense of fun. Costner has made his share of comedies but its apparent he didnt see this as one. Worse the action scenes - which are pedestrian at best - are shunted off to the side to make room for one of the most tedious estranged father-wins-back-daughters-affection subplots ever to grace the silver screen. This material is awful. Costner and Hailee Steinfeld play the scenes like they were written by a great dramatist but every phrase they utter is hackneyed theres minimal chemistry between them and nothing they do carries any emotional weight. Its artificial annoying and boring. Theres not a single human moment in this film and any minimal momentum McG generates comes to a dead stop when these two are interacting. The storyline transpires in Bessons alternate universe where cops are incompetent boobs who never do anything more than interfere on the periphery and the laws of physics are suspended when required by the plot. Costner plays Ethan Renner a CIA lifer who is diagnosed with a form of inoperable brain cancer that causes him black out at inopportune moments (like when hes about to bring down the bad guy). The doctors give him three months to live so he quits his job and heads back to his home in Paris to reconnect with his estranged wife Christine (Connie Nielsen) and daughter Zoey (Steinfeld). The teenager is resentful of him (evident by her insistence in calling him ""Ethan"" instead of ""Dad"") so when Mom conveniently has to leave the country for a few days Ethan offers to play babysitter. This leads to tender moments at an amusement park and an adorable scene in which Ethan teaches his daughter how to ride a bike. Gag. The CIA isnt quite ready to let Ethan go. Top operative Vivi Delay (Amber Heard) needs his help to take out a couple of terrorist-types The Albino (Tomas Lemarquis) and The Wolf (Richard Sammel). She offers him a deal if he kills both of them shell give him access to an experimental drug that will extend his life. Unfortunately for Ethan the period when Vivi requires his cooperation coincides with the time when hes chaperoning Zoey. Hilarity ensues. Not really. Its easy enough to see the films comedic potential and just as easy to identify how badly it botches the opportunity. Just about the only thing McG gets right is the handling of Vivi. Shes a bizarre off-the-wall character - a living monument to fetishes of all flavors. The PG-13 rating which McG constantly pushes is at its most restrictive when shes around. One gets the sense that given some latitude McG might have gone full-R with this character. Heard is deliciously over-the-top and livens things up when shes on screen. Unfortunately thats maybe 10-15 minutes. The rest of time were stuck with a brooding grizzled unshaven Costner. The thing about 3 Days to Kill isnt that every other line of dialogue sounds canned and every other action causes the viewers eyes to roll. Its that the movie isnt fun. And more than anything else Luc Besson stands for fun. Stupid fun perhaps. Silly violent fun for sure. But fun. 3 Days to Kill is a slog. A chore. A tiresome 113 minutes in a theater that makes the idea of grouting the bathroom tiles seem preferable. After a number of years in relative obscurity Costner has decided to re-emerge.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Feb. 21 2014 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Feb. 21 2014 1200AM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by McG Written by Luc Besson and Adi Hasak Starring Kevin Costner Amber Heard and Hailee Steinfeld Country USA Language English In the French-American thriller 3 Days to Kill Kevin Costner plays Ethan Renner a CIA assassin with an unusual burden of life-work balance problems. After he collapses during the take-down of a black-market French arms dealer he learns he has terminal cancer and decides to spend his remaining months bonding with his wife Christine (Connie Nielsen) and teenaged daughter Zoey (Hailee Steinfeld). Then his real troubles begin. Ethan finds his Paris apartment has been illegally occupied by a noisily friendly African family of squatters and the French bureaucracy being what it is says he has no choice but to live and let live. When he agrees to look after Zoey for three days while Christine is on a business trip he gets sucked into another assignment. Another agent a pouty power flirt named Vivi (Amber Heard who flounces through the movie in stiletto heels leather and Spandex ensembles and many wigs) says she will provide him with a life-prolonging experimental drug if he agrees to kill some more nuclear-weapon-dealing bad guys who have nicknames like The Albino and The Wolf which proves they need killing. 3 Days to Kill was produced and co-written by Luc Besson who is a specialist in eye-rolling French action comedies (The Fifth Element Leon The Professional) that wink at their own contrivances and cliches. Here the main compensation is that we get to kill three days in the touristic centre of Paris and spend some time with Costner in his first lead role in a half-dozen years. The 59-year-old actor plays a reassuringly familiar type a gentlemanly all-American curmudgeon (like a cross between Jimmy Stewart and Gary Cooper) who is forced to conform to social norms but keeps his skill for violence close by. Ethan is referred to as a cowboy by most of the Europeans he meets despite his grizzled hipster goatee and knotted fashion scarf. To the degree that the film works its because Costner plays the straight man.The movie is directed by McG a.k.a. Joseph McGinty Nichol the producer-director who has made better movies (his first film was Charlies Angels) and much worse (the abysmal spy/romance This Means War). Here McG does a competent job of giving us a Besson movie The action sequences and gunfights are slick the comedy is crude with a broad wink and theres a chubby Eastern European spy (Marc Andreoni) whom Ethan keeps picking up and torturing for information though he also asks him for parental advice because his victim has two teenaged daughters.3 Days to Kill is a comic variation on the Taken movies which Besson also co-wrote and produced starring Liam Neeson as a daughter-rescuing spy. With 3 Days dad is mostly concerned with saving Zoey from predatory boys. The part where Ethan reduces Zoeys boyfriend to nervous babbling is amusing and even the nightclub scene when he beats the fromage out of the creeps who are groping Zoey appeals to protective fantasies. But you cant do anything except shudder at the tone-deaf scene where Ethan teaches his daughter to slow dance to Breads Make It With You.Uncharacteristically the issue of Ethans illness is treated with restraint even ignored for large stretches of the film which avoids making 3 Days to Kill a downer and brings its heroic fantasy in everyday perspective Dying is easy; raising teenagers is hard.

Theres probably some truth to that -- 3 Days was written and produced by French action impresario Luc Besson who was also behind Neesons Taken and presumably hopes for some similar magic here. But this new film directed by McG (of Charlies Angels uh fame) feels at once like a lot more and not quite enough. Taken effectively reinvented the soft-eyed sensitive Neesons career by casting him against type putting him in a series of tough no-nonsense action fantasies. But Costner rarely does no-nonsense; Costner usually overloads. And so 3 Days is sort of the anti-Taken a comic-tragic-sentimental genre hodgepodge that wants to make you feel all the feelings amid all that action spectacle. It doesnt entirely deliver but at times you cant help but admire its strangeness. Costner is Ethan Renner a veteran Secret Service ""lifer"" whom we first meet as he botches a big nuclear arms bust in Belgrade thanks to a nagging cold and an ill-timed birthday call to his estranged daughter. (Funny) After he collapses on the job however hes informed that the cold is not a cold at all but cancer and that he basically has three months to live. (Cancer Not funny) So Ethan retires and heads back to Paris his former base to try to reconnect with his teenage daughter Zoey (True Grits Hailee Steinfeld) and make amends with his ex-wife (Connie Nielsen). While there he also discovers that his own apartment has been taken over by a family of Malian squatters and under French law he cant kick them out in winter. Inevitably the Service pulls our hero back in thanks to ambitious beautiful young agent Vivi Delay (Amber Heard) who is still after the Wolf (Richard Sammel) the mysterious arms dealer Ethan failed to nab in Belgrade. Vivi needs Ethan because hes the only person whos managed to glimpse the Wolf. To entice him she offers an experimental remedy that could help cure his cancer. And so Ethan has to go back to living his double life this time trying to spend quality time with Zoey while also clandestinely disposing of baddies in exchange for shots of his cancer cure. Oh also The medicine sometimes makes him have strobing weirdo flashback blackouts and the only way to stop those is to guzzle some vodka. (Youd think that a resourceful guy like him would at this point start carrying around a flask of vodka -- but well youd be wrong.) This intensely silly story veers oddly between broad cultural comedy (Ethan vs. the Malians Ethan vs. a Middle Eastern bagman who works for the Wolf Ethan vs. Zoeys French boyfriend) daddy-daughter sentiment (Ethan teaches Zoey to ride a bike and to dance Ethan watches as the daughter of the Malian family gives birth) and elaborate action high jinks (one car chase in particular with a the zooming vehicles weaving in and out of traffic in wide shots is rather effective). And it all might have worked had Besson himself or some variation of the director he used to be been at the helm. This fluidity of emotional range was actually his forte back in the days of masterworks like Leon (The Professional) and La Femme Nikita. Back then his style overpowered everything else -- flattening everything into a colorful fantasia of emotions laughs and thrills held together with elaborate tracking shots thick atmosphere inventive editing and Eric Serras insistent music. McG is also a stylist but a less distinctive one. No two sequences in this film feel like they came from the same mind whipsawing the viewer back and forth between emotional extremes. A shame too because theres potentially good stuff here Costner a likable actor whose Achilles heel in the past has been a propensity for self-importance handles the comedy well. The film also presents some intriguing ideas. For example one senses uncomfortable similarities between Vivi and Zoey -- they never meet but their constant hairstyle changes seem cosmically aligned -- almost as if the adult female agent might be a projection in Ethans mind of his own daughters future. But the idea like so much else in this film just kind of gets dropped. In McGs hands 3 Days to Kill rarely coheres. A deft tightly staged hotel raid in the opening scenes gives way to weirdly drippy sentimentality when Ethan finds out hes sick which gives way to goofy shrill humor when he discovers the Malian family in his apartment. If the story itself werent so all over the place that kind of tonal variation might have worked to give it shape and shading. But this type of material needs a uniter not a divider -- someone to make it feel all of a piece not a journeyman to give it context-free canned pizazz.

The name Kevin became the countrys most popular for new babies a Gaelic moniker edging out national stalwarts like Antoine and Jules. Imagine if everyone in America suddenly named their son Pierre. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - During the stretch where Robin Hood Prince of Thieves and The Bodyguard conquered the world - each making more abroad than they did at home - one in 10 petits hommes was christened Kevin. Which means that while Americans have forgotten they once loved Kevin Costner the French never can.Knowing that it makes sense that Costners latest 3 Days to Kill takes place in Paris. Costner plays Ethan Renner a worn-out CIA assassin whos spent his life hunting baddies with comic book names like The Albino and The Wolf. (At least the former is played by real-life albino Tomas Lemarquis of the very good Icelandic film Noi the Albino - please someone cast him for something other than being pale.) Before the credits Costner kills a half-dozen people and is then diagnosed with terminal brain cancer as if fate feels it must balance the score to appease the widows of the deceased.Film Details 3 Days to Kill RatingPG-13 GenreSuspense/Thriller Running Time117 min. More Info Trailer Costner will leave behind his own widow (Connie Nielsen) though truthfully he widowed her a decade before by choosing work over marriage. Theres also an estranged teen daughter named Zoey (Hailee Steinfeld) who couldnt look less like her blond blue-eyed parents if shed popped out of the womb with green skin and wings.

Sep. 13 600pm No matter. 3 Days to Kill was directed by McG who wouldnt know the definition of coherence if Charlies Angels grabbed his attention by wearing hot pants and then defined it for him slowly. Thats not necessarily a dis. I sometimes enjoy a scattershot McG action/comedy/romance/drama as its the closest our era has to witnessing the audience-pleasing ambitions of a William Wyler if Wyler had first gotten drunk on Bud Light Lime.Kill is a singular mess at once a drama about a man confronting his pending death a romance about reconciling with his ex a comedy about his clueless attempts to connect with his daughter and a sci-fi action flick where a leather-corset-clad Amber Heard pops up with an expensive experimental cancer treatment shes willing to give him if he comes out of retirement to torture and kill another dozen or so crooks. And I havent even gotten to the seven Malian immigrants illegally yet unevictably squatting in his rarely used flat and the tender moment when a young mother clutches her newborn daughter and announces shes going to name her Ethan. I guess even Kevin is passe.Of course the movie doesnt work. But Costner does. No matter now nonsensical and uneven 3 Days to Kill gets hes miraculously consistent a mans man and ladys hero who leaps over every tonal hurdle without ever giving a cheap ""Yeah I know this is bunk but I needed the paycheck"" wink to the audience. Hes comfortable flinging his fists in a Parisian bakery fight involving tray of croissants a jambon slicer and a broken bottle of Beaujolais. Hes fine playing the ugly American sneering to Steinfelds local boyfriend that he prefers ""real football."" (Of the jeans he wears throughout the film a Frenchman snorts ""He comes from Brokeback Mountain."") Costners so good hes almost a throwback to John Wayne and Jimmy Cagney talents who did some of their best work simply trying to rise above the material.This might be exactly the role Costner needs to remind us that hes the rare actor who can do everything. Watching him shoot the guy drive the car kiss the babe and teach the kid to ride a bike we understand why a generation of French boys bears the name Kevin. Perhaps the next generation will too.Directed by McG. Written by Luc Besson and Adi Hasak. Starring Kevin Costner Hailee Steinfeld Amber Heard and Connie Nielsen.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet 3 Days To Kill is one Liam Neeson shy of a Liam Neeson vehicle. Produced by EuropaCorp (of Taken fame) and co-written by Luc Besson (also of Taken fame) the film features a 60-ish American operative darting around a European city fretting about his teenage daughter and demonstrating his very particular set of skills. The part could have been (and maybe was) written for Neeson whos carved out quite a niche for himself in the booming industry of French-made action distractions. Instead however the producers of 3 Days To Kill have secured Kevin Costner an actor comparable only in AARP eligibility. When Neeson slums in genre junk he does so with grizzled intensity turning his physical wear and tear into an advantage. Costner by contrast is too laidback to intimidate; he seems less battle-wearied than simply weary nailing only half of the profitable ""aging ass-kicker"" equation. Firefights and car chases just dont suit this movie star of advancing years.Decked out in loose-fitting formal wear as though a lack of 007 suaveness were the height of hilarity Costner plays Ethan a veteran CIA trigger man forced into belated retirement by a fatal medical diagnosis. Ready to call it a career he trudges back to Paris to spend his remaining days with the estranged wife (Connie Nielsen) and daughter (Hailee Steineld) hes historically neglected. The CIA however has other ideas Dangling an experimental cure under his nose the organization coerces Ethan into one last execution order--an assignment that naturally coincides with a three-day stint looking after his brood while the wife is away on business. 3 Days To Kill pivots around that personal/professional dilemma forcing its over-the-hill hitman to multitask between father-knows-best bonding sessions and the less heartwarming business of obtaining sensitive information using a car battery. The results--sometimes distasteful never funny--suggest a schmaltzy family dramedy periodically interrupted by slipshod action scenes.Sitting at the helm of this schizophrenic entertainment is McG the mononymous Hollywood hack behind the Charlies Angels movies and Terminator Salvation. The director has attempted comic spy games before in the profoundly creepy rom-com This Means War. Just as that film put an ""amusing"" spin on government wiretapping and other invasions of privacy 3 Days To Kill milks enhanced interrogation methods for unsavory humor. (The movies lamest running gag finds Ethan interrupted moments before violating some civil liberty by the tinny blare of Icona Pops ""I Love It""--his daughters ringtone naturally.) Though plagued by guilt over his years as a deadbeat dad Costners seasoned assassin is unburdened by killers remorse; he even makes a local moppet the son of the family squatting in his Parisian apartment an accomplice to his torture techniques. Ethan isnt much more appealing as a father figure Stopping a trio of Euro-trash teens from gang-groping his daughter at a nightclub he confronts that trauma with tough love coming dangerously close to blaming the victim. Later after a reconciliation the two share a vaguely incestuous slow-dance; audiences may be reminded that Besson working at the bottom of his abilities here also conceived of the pedophilic quasi-romance in The Professional.3 Days To Kill is sloppy in conception and execution with subplots that go absolutely nowhere and superfluous supporting characters crowding the movies margins. What greater purpose for example does Ethans vamping CIA handler serve? Played by a ridiculously miscast Amber Heard who seems to be auditioning for the role of Angelina Jolies official successor this femme fatale strolls blithely into scenes without warning and coos embarrassing bon mots like ""I like my boys better-dressed than the men they kill."" (Her appearances are about as sexy as a cold shower.) As for Costner hes just wrong for the part--convincing as a sports-loving American dad but never as an elite superspy. The Neeson career plan wont work for everyone. Not many action fans in other words are likely to call 3 Days To Kill their jam.

"In 3 Days to Kill bullets and pasta sauce dont mix review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesIn 3 Days to Kill bullets and pasta sauce dont mix reviewLong before Kevin Costner is demanding pasta sauce info at gunpoint from a terrified Italian hostage in 3 Days to Kill its obvious no one is following a coherent recipe for this movie.Kevin Costner and Connie Nielsen in 3 Days to Kill.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Feb. 20 20143 Days to KillStarring Kevin Costner Hailee Steinfeld Connie Nielsen and Amber Heard. Directed by McG. Opens Feb. 21 at GTA theatres. 117 minutes. PG.Long before Kevin Costner is demanding pasta sauce info at gunpoint from a terrified Italian hostage in 3 Days to Kill its obvious no one is following any kind of coherent recipe for this movie. Its an international spy thriller. On second thought its a family divorce drama. No wait its a comedy about wacky Americans in Paris. But then again should we be laughing about a guy dying of brain cancer?Article Continued Below3 Days to Kill is all of these things because it seems writer/producer Luc Besson (the Taken franchise) and director McG (Charlies Angels This Means War) were too busy mixing ingredients from their own past movies to agree on what they were jointly trying to concoct here.Besson (and co-writer Adi Hasak) contribute the Paris setting the terrorism threat the high body count and the squealing car chases on city streets.McG evidently goes in for the goofy character stuff such as the habit of Costners veteran CIA hit man Ethan Renner to demand child rearing advice from the same people he may soon be filling full of lead. The films not-so-clever title tips to its scrambled intentions. Renner has a long weekend to stop an international terrorist and arms dealer known as ""the Wolf"" (yawn) who is planning to peddle a dirty bomb to a band of nogoodniks with global mayhem ensuing thereafter.In the same amount of time Renner must also make good with his rebellious teen daughter Zoey (Hailee Steinfeld) and ex-wife Christine (Connie Nielsen). He abandoned them five years ago and they now live in Paris trying to forget him.If this isnt enough to keep the clock ticking in overdrive Renner also has to deal with the death sentence just handed him by his doc. He has a rare form of brain cancer that will claim him in about three months -- unless he can cure it with the radical new serum offered by sexy fellow CIA operative Vivi (Amber Heard) who is offering jabs from her hypo in exchange for bullets in the hide of Wolf and his stooges.Renner had been planning to hang up his silencer -- his former spouse is demanding it as a precondition to family reunion -- but Vivis choice is more urgent ""Kill or die.""Its laudable to make Costners character more than just another flinty-eyed tough guy the kind he regularly portrayed in his 1980s heyday. He actually seems to be enjoying this gig never a sure thing with him.And its very good that hes gray-haired and paired with Nielsen 48 who is more appropriate to his real age 59 than Heard 27. (This doesnt stop Heards Vivi from trying of course ""Im everybodys type"" she coos.)But with so much being tossed into the stewpot 3 Days to Kill becomes indigestible.Its why you get ridiculous scenes like the one where Renner is aiming a gun at the aforementioned Italian hostage who has been duct-taped onto a toilet.The toilet is in Renners own apartment by the way which hes kindly sharing with a large family of immigrant squatters who invaded the place while he was away shooting people in other countries. Zoey is on the phone. She wants to cook spaghetti for her new boyfriend and since Renners hostage is Italian he must know how to make a good sauce right? The Italians name is Guido and the movie is rife with such stereotypes. There are also shrugging Frenchmen officious Germans and rude and impatient Americans. The latter is amply demonstrated by Costners character whose trigger-happy behaviour and rant about ""real football"" (he has no use for soccer) certainly play into unhappy cliched notions about U.S. citizens in Europe.And speaking of cliches could Besson and McG possibly have worked more shots of the Eiffel Tower into this film? It shows up so often it should have been given marquee billing. Perhaps they were hoping that 3 Days to Kill could also serve as a tourism video for Paris. And whats one more role for a film that is already overloaded with them?The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Review 3 Days to Kill a spy thriller with faulty aim - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review 3 Days to Kill a spy thriller with faulty aim 3 Days to Kill Movie review by Betsy Sharkey Betsy Sharkey reviews 3 Days to Kill starring Kevin Costner Hailee Steinfeld Amber Heard and Connie Nielsen. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Betsy Sharkey reviews 3 Days to Kill starring Kevin Costner Hailee Steinfeld Amber Heard and Connie Nielsen. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Is McG going soft on us? Has the director behind so much of the 21st centurys over-the-top action -- from the light froth of his ""Charlies Angels"" reboot to the post-apocalyptic dark of ""Terminator Salvation"" -- tapped into a more sentimental side?""3 Days to Kill"" starring Kevin Costner Hailee Steinfeld and Amber Heard certainly suggests a different emotional temperature. McG is a filmmaker in transition mixing metaphors genres and feelings in this action-thriller espionage-comedy family-drama jumble. The result is a little like baby bears porridge neither all bad nor all good though not quite right yet either. Still ""3 Days to Kill"" is not a terrible way to kill a couple of hours.PHOTOS Box office top 10 of 2013 Written by Luc Besson and Adi Hasak the film comes with many of Bessons trademarks -- lots of firepower and sexy women with guns of the type showcased early on in 1990s ""La Femme Nikita"" written and directed by the French filmmaker.In this case Heard is wielding the hardware. She is a CIA agent named Vivi being sent to Serbia to eliminate an international terrorist code-named the Wolf (Richard Sammel). The Albino (Tomas Lemarquis) is also headed to Serbia also a terrorist but shes to leave him to the veteran agent on the ground one Ethan Renner (Costner).Ethan rumpled and coughing and ultimately collapsing is definitely not aging well.Meanwhile Vivis conservative looks at Langley are deceiving. Soon enough shes overseas sporting designer/bondage couture high-tech weaponry and doing most of her business out of pricey European strip clubs. Congressional oversight be damned. Ethan on the other hand leaves Serbia a mess. The Albino gets away a hotel is destroyed and there are quite a few surplus dead bodies to deal with. And thats not his main problem. The hard-bitten spy wakes up in a hospital to a death sentence Brain cancer couple of months get-your-life-in-order time.BEST MOVIES OF 2013 Turan | Sharkey | OlsenWe already know from the voicemail hes left on daughter Zooeys (Steinfeld) phone there are serious daddy issues back home. But home is Paris so there is an upside. Good locations for McG to apply lots of his famous polish.The death sentence might sound maudlin. Instead the target territory is closer to the sniping and shooting that went on between ""Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith"" the 2005 assassin-love satire that created Brangelina. Rather than warring spouses ""3 Days"" has dad and daughter dancing around all the explosive issues.Like who can a CIA killer turn to for advice in navigating those turbulent teen waters? A mole? A mob accountant? Where can he get wise counsel? The squatters crowding his Paris apartment?Ethan does have to deal with the occasional hallucination from the experimental meds Vivis giving him in trade for his help in taking out the Wolf. But luckily relief is just a few shots of Vodka away. Good news at cocktail parties bad news in subway stations.The difficulty for McG is in the juggling act this requires. How to balance a father-daughter reconciliation story with a spy thriller with a life-and-death medical crisis with a farce? This is where the films many fraying edges are exposed.PHOTOS Behind the scenes of movies and TVThere are moments between Ethan and Zooey that feel like the real deal and Costner and Steinfeld have a good chemistry. But the film goes wildly overboard on the problem front packing every possible teen girl quandary into a few days from learning to ride a bike to date-rape drugs no kidding.There are times the Wolf hunt gets intense with all the requisite spy game maneuvering and bang-bang-pow the shattered glass and bloodied bodies falling with a stylized grace.But McG keeps hamming up the farce allowing it to grab all the attention like an obnoxious teenage thug. The absurd takes so many shapes and shows up around so many corners its just too much.Then before you can decide whether to laugh or groan the movie shifts into sentimental mode for some sweet or sad moment between Ethan and Zooey including gooey flashbacks of her childhood complete with carnival rides beaches and nothing but smiles.The film is helped by Costners self-deprecating aw-shucks charm. The actor is game whether hes being asked to fight off truculent teens or treacherous terrorists or patch up Zooeys boy problems. From his Oscar wins for ""Dances With Wolves"" to his sweetheart turn in ""The Bodyguard"" to his washed-up golf pro in ""Tin Cup"" Costner understands his strengths and plays to all of them at times here.Now if McG could just figure out his sweet spot or at least limit the number hes going for in any given film he might improve his game too.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com--------------------------------------3 Days to KillMPAA rating PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action some sensuality and languageRunning time 1 hour 53 minutesPlaying In general release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Movies Politics and Government Espionage and Intelligence McG Kevin Costner Reviews Kevin Costner swears during live interview with KTLAs Sam Rubin Review 3 Days to Kill a spy thriller with faulty aim Review Omar is heartbreaking tale of love across isolation walls Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad81deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-3-days-to-kill-20140221,0,7976869.story#axzz2tu3e0UZa",200,3daystokill13,3daystokill,latimes

Grade D The director who calls himself McG says that before he made this inept spy movie he asked himself ""What happens with James Bond when he goes home?"" Actually Bond figures in this bloated queasy quasi-comical extravaganza only as a pun. The films grizzled cancer-riddled secret agent Ethan Renner (Kevin Costner) spends half the time blasting bad guys and the other half bonding with almost everyone. Renner bonds with the lovable African squatters whove moved into his Paris pad. He bonds with his skeptical ex-wife (Connie Nielsen) and his petulant teenage daughter (Hailee Steinfeld). When hes not torturing or terrorizing them he even bonds with low-level employees of his enemies like an Italian accountant named Guido() who tells Renners daughter how to make spaghetti sauce. (If you dont think thats funny maybe youll like how daddys little girl repeatedly interrupts his dirty work with her signature cellphone tune Icona Pops ""I Love It."") The rare person Renner doesnt bond with is his CIA handler (Amber Heard) who dresses like shes more into bondage anyway. Judging from his previous blunder the Mafia farce ""The Family"" producer/co-writer Luc Besson thinks crossing mayhem with domestic merriment is automatically hilarious. Director McG is too pretentious to sustain either thrills or laughs especially when his camera mirrors Renners rattled state of mind whenever an anti-cancer wonder drug kicks in. Costner is superbly wry and ruggedly assured but he cant save this mess singlehanded. By the time Renner gets to his two-stage showdown with dirty-bomb dealers Wolfgang - known imaginatively as ""The Wolf"" - and his albino lieutenant - called of course ""The Albino"" - ""3 Days to Kill"" feels like its lasted a lifetime.

The result is a convoluted mess that has one good twist and two good car chases. But its hardly enough to bring this spy flick in from the cold.Costner plays Ethan Renner a CIA operative good at making people dead and lousy at being a dad. When we meet him hes with a group of fellow super-spies tasked with bringing down a mysterious arms dealer known as ""The Wolf"" and his henchman ""The Albino."" The latter resembles Gollum if he left the Lord of the Rings set and swiped an Armani suit on the way out.STORY 3 Days in a film-filled year for Kevin CostnerREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersThe bust goes awry when Ethan bearing down on his targets gets dizzy and falls (it happens a lot). He learns he has brain cancer thats spread to his lungs and that he has three months to live.Ethan decides its time to get to know his estranged wife Christine (Connie Nielsen) and teenage daughter Zoey (Hailee Steinfeld) who gets a happy birthday call once a year from Dad.The set-up is so rushed and pat that we barely have time to digest Days next wrinkle the beautiful operative Vivi Delay (Amber Heard). She not only wants Ethan to finish the assignment she also has a mystery drug that could cure his cancer if he agrees. Yep.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Kevin Costner plays an international spy juggling espionage and fatherhood in 3 Days to Kill. VPCEthan takes the job and begins an odyssey through the streets of Paris to track down ruthless Europeans of varied vague accents. Youll get lost trying to keep track of the baddies but just remember If theyre foreign theyre evil.Its hard to tell what director McG was going for here because each moment of tension comes undone with a scene of banality. After blowing away a few henchmen Ethan comes home to find a family of squatters has moved into his house and painted his bedroom a wacky yellow. The French police tell him simply that squatters have rights in France and to boot them out would land Ethan in jail.And thats one of Days more believable twists. McG (Charlies Angels Terminator Salvation) has a firm grip on action if not acting.Steinfeld in particular is simply too old for the part (shes 17 in real life). Scenes meant to establish bonding between father and child which include Ethan teaching the high-schooler to dance and ride a bike dont work when the kid is nearly as quick clever and tall as Pops.And Days embraces so much convention that a seminar could break out. Ethans mystery drug just happens to make him pass out every time hes about to bring down a villain likely prompting viewer questions Will his cancer be cured? Is Vivi a villain? Will your theater offer refunds?Days does offer a plot surprise in the third act and the car chases are top-notch.

Then another CIA agent gives him a solution Go back on the job for one more weekend. Oh and murder maybe half-a-dozen villains in Paris. Then shell provide a magical medical cure. So basically Ethan has ""3 Days to Kill."" The question is Do you have two hours? If so I can think of better ways than settling in for this latest Kevin Costner movie which combines the slightly unhinged plotting of Luc Besson and the over-the-top filmmaking pyrotechnics of McG. Its a movie thats races from no place to nowhere only to end in a headache. The movie starts at CIA headquarters where an icy young woman in high heels is given a new mission Take out a dirty-bomb salesman known as the Albino who may or may not be accompanied by a mysterious all-around bad guy called the Wolf. She however decides to outsource this to that famously cranky old spy known as the Geezer. Well no I made that last part up; Costners character doesnt have an idiotic aint-it-cool nickname. (""The Albino""? Really?) But it gives you an idea of the sort of juvenile level that Bessons scripts usually operate on where its always April in Paris the heroes are invariably unshaven and unstoppable and the heroines dresses just get tinier and tighter with every scene. Back when Besson directed his own scripts making movies like ""La Femme Nikita"" and ""Leon The Professional"" -- before he became a kind of one-man studio seeding the world with half-written scripts -- his work had a great giddy energy. And before it became just another cliche his fondness for lethal leggy heroines was fresh too. But by now so many people have copied him - mostly him - he feels like a bit of a joke. I think he knows it too. Directed by the ever easily distracted McG the movie begins with an extraordinary amount of vicious violence including the decapitation of a woman the shooting of perhaps a dozen people and the absolutely unnecessary bombing of an entire hotel floor. Then we get the credits. But then the movie slowly weirdly begins to swerve first into comedy then sentimentality. Ethan returns to Paris to find a farcical group of African immigrants squatting in his apartment then awkwardly tries to reconnect with his estranged wife and daughter. He comically tortures a crooked Italian accountant then teaches his daughter to ride a bike. The movie obviously is trying to make two things very clear People with accents are funny. Also although this spy may hook up screaming men to car batteries hes actually an old softy. Its like a bad Liam Neeson actioner crossed with a worse American sitcom and its a mess. The harder it is to take all this seriously though the harder Costner seems to try. It doesnt help nor do the various second-rate actors cast in villainous roles who never rise above ""competent."" Still that puts them several steps above the absurd Amber Heard who plays Ethans dominatrix CIA handler and never looks like anything more than a child playing dress-up. There is though one last marvelously idiotic touch in all this. The miracle cancer drug it seems has a side effect. Every so often it racks Ethan with painful cramps and debilitating hallucinations. Theres only one quick way to stop the pain and restore some sanity Drink a lot of vodka fast. I wish theyd given me that tip before the movie. Ratings note The film contains sexual situations violence and torture. 3 Days to Kill (PG-13) Relativity (113 min.) Directed by McG. With Kevin Costner Amber Heard.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it Kevin Costner stars as Ethan Renner an international spy with a terminal diagnosis who takes on his final misssion in ""3 Days to Kill."" (Julian Torres) By Michael OSullivan February 20 2014 ""3 Days to Kill"" offers us a dilemma. Can ex-CIA operative Ethan Renner (Kevin Costner) repair his relationship with his estranged teenage daughter Zoey (Hailee Steinfeld) while maintaining his commitment to his old employer who has pulled him out of retirement for one last round of targeted killing extraordinary rendition and enhanced interrogation? That narrative predicament is precisely echoed by the challenges faced by the films director McG. Best known as the director of ""Charlies Angels"" and the producer of numerous TV shows including ""The O.C."" and ""Chuck"" the filmmaker born Joseph McGinty Nichol attempts to negotiate a middle path between the loud action thriller that this films trailer makes you think youre buying a ticket to and the sappy drama of father-daughter bonding that the movie really is. Costner for his part makes juggling his characters twin obligations look easy. Ethan rarely breaks a sweat whether hes shooting arms dealers or pulling a bunch of would-be rapists off of his daughter in a nightclub mens room. For McG -- who has to convince people to sit through the scenes of Ethan teaching his daughter how to ride a bike or slow dance just to get to the part where he hooks some guy up to jumper cables -- the disconnect is more jarring. ""3 Days to Kill"" feels like two very different movies neither of which is particularly good. Most of the blame falls to Luc Besson who co-wrote the screenplay from his own story idea with Adi Hasak (""From Paris With Love""). As a writer Besson is notoriously hit-or-miss with hits like 1997s ""The Fifth Element"" sharing space on his resume with last years bomb ""The Family."" As melodrama ""3 Days to Kill"" comes across as pat and saccharine. As a popcorn flick its overly predictable. And the balance between the two is off. The story gets underway when Ethan recently retired and diagnosed with terminal cancer undertakes one final assignment from a mysterious woman named Vivi (Amber Heard) who offers him what she claims is an experimental cure in exchange for his service. The conflict arises when Ethan learns that he must conduct his dirty business which involves finding and killing an arms dealer (Richard Sammel) while chaperoning Zoey who has been left in Ethans care for three days by his ex-wife (Connie Nielsen). In Ethans line of work a gun is the most effective problem-solving tool. That doesnt fly when it comes to corralling a slightly rebellious adolescent suffering from a bad hair day. Comedy occurs sporadically as when Ethan extracts a recipe for spaghetti sauce from a man (Bruno Ricci) whom he is in the middle of torturing just so Zoey can cook dinner for her boyfriend Hugh (Jonas Bloquet). When the laughs arise theyre welcome. But theyre few and far between. McG keeps hinting at paydays that never come. Is Vivi really on the up and up? Heard plays her like shes hiding some dark secret but we never find out what it is. And whats with the serum that she keeps injecting Ethan with which seems to be killing him rather than curing him? Finally how will Ethan handle the discovery that Hugh seems to be tangentially mixed up with the bad guys? Those and other mysteries are dangled tantalizingly in front of the audience but are never solved. Like Ethan ""3 Days to Kill"" has a job to do but it prefers to shoot first and ask questions later. 3 Days to Kill  1/2 (113 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for violence obscenity and sensuality. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Kids dont drink and write or you could cause an accident like the script for ""3 Days to Kill."" The film comes from French writer/producer Luc Besson (of the ""Transporter"" series) who is determined to prove that not all European films are sophisticated and artistic. Its a lumpy agglomeration of henpecked-dad sitcom humor sado-comedy and plastic explosive. It aims for offbeat but hits tone deaf dead center. Kevin Costner stars as a grumpy-lovable CIA hit man Ethan Renner. Hes divorced and an absentee dad what with killing people afar. He means well though. In the midst of one high-caliber hailstorm he ducks out to give his seldom-seen daughter Zoey (""True Grits"" Hailee Steinfeld) a birthday call. Miss Teen Attitude insists that he sing to her over the phone. He does then bolts off to make a pile of corpses. He wants to fix their relationship fast. He has late-stage Movie Cancer the kind that allows you to brawl like an Olympian but makes you pass out when you have the drop on the worlds biggest villain. Renner is assigned to spymaster Vivi Delay (Amber Heard). At headquarters she dresses like a beige office mouse. In the field she wears full makeup naughty dominatrix heels and skintight black leather because its important to be inconspicuous when youre undercover. Delay taps the terminally ill Renner for a vital assignment. Apparently Obamacare requires the CIA to ignore pre-existing conditions. Renners quarry is the Albino. In return for taking the assignment Delay gives Renner a magic elixir that will halt his cancer while people shoot at him. Renner reunites with Zoey in Paris. He treats the high-schooler like shes an enlarged 9-year-old. She pitches hissy fits about dating and sneaks off to clubs. Kids Renner who maimed the Albinos Paris driver for information follows up with some questions about parenting. The family men bond on the spot because of course they would. 3 days to kill 1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for intense violence and action some sensuality and language. Renner overcompensating for his lost years doesnt discipline Zoey for her transgressions but punishes every lecherous lad around her with made-in-USA cowboy violence. In the meantime he teaches her how to ride a bikeand how to slow dance at the prom. Softening she places her squawky pop music ringtone on his phone. No worries A top assassin would always put his phone on vibrate before stalking his quarry right? Renner is not the first dimming star to fall into Bessons cinematic void. Liam Neeson (in the popular ""Taken"" series) and Robert De Niro (in last years Mafia misfire ""The Family"") have played variations on the same fish out of water/loving dad/remorseless killer character. Never the lightest comedian Costner cant find the punch lines in the storys culture clash encounters between his blunt-instrument Yank and arrogant Frenchmen. Its a shame for him but the finale which promises a followup film is a nightmare for us. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

TWITTER This comic spy thriller stars Kevin Costner as a dying CIA agent who is recruited for one last mission. Yet another member of the AARP generation of action movie stars returns to show us how its done in 3 Days to Kill marking Kevin Costners first big-screen leading role in many a moon. Playing Ethan a dying CIA agent enticed to go on one last mission by the promise of an experimental drug that could prolong his life the veteran actor effortlessly exudes the cool charisma here tinged with a comic world-weariness that reminds us why he became a star in the first place. Its a good thing the film has him because this comic spy thriller is such a preposterous mashup of action humor and sentimentality that it desperately needs his anchoring presence. Based on a story by Luc Besson who also co-scripted its main plot element is not Ethans perfunctory assignment to kill a eurotrash villain but rather his intense desire to reconnect with his long estranged wife Christine (Connie Nielsen) and teenage daughter Zoey (Hailee Steinfeld). Cue a running gag in which every time Ethan is about to say torture a bad guy hes interrupted by a phone call from Zoey signaled by her personal ring tone the Icona Pop song ""I Love It (I Dont Care)."" PHOTOS 35 of 2014s Most Anticipated Movies Ethan whose hacking cough in the first moments indicates that hes got more than a bad cold is recruited for the mission by Vivi (Amber Heard) a vampish CIA handler who apparently thinks that the best way to keep a low profile is to wear skintight leather outfits and bright red lipstick. Constantly smoking a cigarette to indicate her coolness shes the sort of ridiculous creation that would no doubt inspire riotous chortling were the film to be screened at Langley. Ethans mission is to kill ""The Wolf"" who makes it his business to supply dirty weapons to terrorists the world over. But he finds it a little hard to concentrate on the job at hand when hes simultaneously trying to deal with Zoey who harbors longstanding resentment over his absent fatherhood and the large brood of squatters who have taken over his ramshackle Paris apartment. Director McG who trafficked in similar territory with 2012s This Means War throws in enough high-octane action sequences including a harrowing car chase through the streets of Paris to please genre fans. At age 59 Costner is still physically up to the task convincingly beating up guys less than half his age. But what clearly attracted him to the role was not the pro forma tough-guy stuff but rather the complicated family dynamics that tax Ethan far more than his mission. Tasked with taking care of Zoey for three days while his wife is out of town hes perpetually bewildered by the rebellious young woman who disdains the garish purple bicycle hes given her as a peace offering. This results in some amusing moments as when Ethan interrupts his interrogation of an Italian bad guy to force him to get on the phone with Zooey and tell her his mothers recipe for spaghetti sauce or when he takes lessons in fatherhood from an informant (a very funny Marc Andreoni) whom he mainly keeps locked up in the trunk of his car. The screenplay by Besson and Adi Hasak also makes some humorous nods to Costners past film career such as when after rescuing Zoey from some sexual predators at a rave he lifts her up in his arms as he did Whitney Houston in The Bodyguard. And his pursuit of the villains milquetoast accountant recalls his similar quest in The Untouchables. PHOTOS 25 of the Most Anticipated Foreign Films of 2014 Costner handles all this with a deadpan comic flair looking great in the scruffy jeans that inspire one bad guy to comment disparagingly ""Hes from Brokeback Mountain."" When he finally dons a sharp black suit late in the film the admiring glances he gets from his wife and daughter are sure to be echoed by female audience members of all ages. The film features enough scenic Parisian locations to virtually qualify as a travelogue with nary a familiar landmark overlooked. When he finally teaches an embarrassed Zoey how to ride her new bike he does so not in a secluded spot but rather in the tourist-clogged hills of Montmartre. There are some overdone plot devices such as Ethans constantly collapsing from the ill effects of the drug just as hes about to nab one of the bad guys. And the increasingly fond relationship between him and the squatters including an adorable young boy with whom he learns to high-five is too cutely rendered by far. Its all absurd in a way that is typical Besson. But its also undeniably entertaining and it marks a relatively pain-free way to kill if not three days at least a couple of hours.

Even international spies have trouble balancing work and family life according to ""3 Days to Kill"" the latest lightweight action pic from writer-producer Luc Besson here forming an unlikely (or perhaps unholy) trinity with director McG and star Kevin Costner. Surely the goal of the resulting tonal mishmash was to reignite Costners career a la what happened for Liam Neeson after Bessons ""Taken"" but any possibility of sleeper-hit status has been fatally compromised by watered-down fight scenes and misguided family man dramatics. Three days of decent box office appears the best hope for this Relativity release likely to continue EuropaCorps recent run of non-""Taken"" commercial disappointments in the U.S. International prospects look only moderately livelier. The setup plays as if someone (presumably Besson who is credited with the story and co-wrote the script with ""From Paris With Love"" scribe Adi Hasak) decided to graft the central father/daughter relationship from ""The Descendants"" onto a Eurotrashy action framework. Superstar CIA field agent Ethan Renner (Costner) spends so much time on the job that hes completely missed watching his daughter Zooey (Hailee Steinfeld) blossom into a sophisticated teenager. After hes diagnosed with a fatal illness Ethan retires and resolves to spend more time with his family in Paris offering to watch Zooey for a weekend while his estranged wife Christine (Connie Nielsen) is away. But retirement isnt so easy for a man of Ethans skills and hes promptly recruited by the mysterious Vivi (Amber Heard) who needs his help in the hunt for a terrorist mastermind in exchange for experimental drugs that could give Ethan a second lease on life. The conflict between the finesse Ethan demonstrates in his professional duties and the complete incompetence with which he approaches parenting is meant to be comedic although the film doesnt have the light touch of similar spy-family action-laffers like ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" ""True Lies"" or McGs own ""This Means War."" Instead ""3 Days to Kill"" proves surprisingly po-faced about trying to build the bond between Ethan and Zooey even in the midst of moments as goofy as Dad consoling his daughter on a bad hair day teaching her to dance or buying her a purple bicycle just because that was her favorite color as a kid. The sentimental approach almost works thanks to the best efforts of Costner and the naturally spunky Steinfeld who may have made a respectable pair given better material to work with. As it is the lukewarm family dynamics sit awkwardly alongside equally underwhelming action sequences. Recent supporting turns in ""Man of Steel"" and ""Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit"" aside Costner isnt generally associated with the action genre -- hes more of a ""Waterworld""/""Robin Hood Prince of Thieves"" epic-adventure guy -- and the rote heroics he undertakes here wont do much to change that. On multiple occasions the audience simply witnesses the aftermath of Ethans handiwork as repped by bodies lying motionless on the floor. The notable exceptions arrive in a brief but slickly executed one-on-one skirmish in a grocery stores deli section (complete with resourceful use of the meat grinder and panini press) and a bracingly staged car chase in the middle of a Parisian neighborhood inspired by Claude Lelouchs ""Rendezvous"" and John Frankenheimers ""Ronin."" That chase makes a lovely pairing with McGs other standout sequence a montage of Ethan riding the bike he bought for Zooey through the city streets and parking near the Eiffel Tower. Its a sweet divertissement for the typically boisterous director who overall reins in the bombastic giddiness of his ""Charlies Angels"" pictures and abandons the soulless spectacle of ""Terminator Salvation"" to make an action film thats downright restrained by his standards. Unfortunately in this case the restraint reads as overly safe. ""3 Days to Kill"" is quite literally bloodless -- the fight sequences in ""Taken"" packed a far more potent punch even with the same PG-13 rating -- which seems like a missed opportunity. The juxtaposition of Ethans violent work and gentler paternal side might have added some desperately needed intrigue to the banal story. The filmmakers certainly dont find any of the intended mystery in Ethans fitful encounters with the femme-fatale-ish Vivi a severely under-realized character who never makes any sense despite Heards arduous efforts to vamp it up. Nielsens thankless skeptical spouse role is even less significant while Tomas Lemarquis and Richard Sammel bring nothing beyond menacing visages to their bland terrorist baddies. Its a running gag that Ethan seeks parenting advice from just about anyone he encounters which offers decent moments for character actors Eriq Ebouaney as the African paterfamilias in a family squatting in Ethans semi-abandoned apartment and Marc Andreoni as a Middle Eastern limo driver linked to the villains. Although the films tech package is reliably proficient one would have hoped for more onscreen fireworks from the union of ultra-American McG and Costner with French mainstay Besson. Alas this European vacation is a time-killer of the most mundane variety. Film Review 3 Days to KillReviewed at Arclight Cinemas Hollywood Feb. 12 2014. MPAA Rating PG-13. Running time 116 MIN.

Photo AP MOVIE REVIEW 3 Days to Kill Shoots blanks. Running time 117 minutes. Rated PG-13 (action violence profanity sensuality). At the Empire the Lincoln Square the Kips Bay others When last we caught up with Luc Besson in ""The Family"" he had a jokey comedy about lethal American gangsters in France worrying about their daughters high-school angst. ""3 Days to Kill""? Totally different. This time the American Dad in Paris is a deadly spy instead of a mobster. I picture Besson fondling dusty VHS copies of ""The Sopranos"" and ""True Lies"" gloating ""No one will ever discover my secret sources of inspiration"" Its almost charming the way he goes to such effort to set up such terrible jokes. Its like walking from the Pacific to the East Coast because you have this dream of seeing Trenton. Besson provided the story and co-wrote the screenplay for a film directed by McG who does his usual McGhastly job with action and is McGruesome when it comes to comedy. Kevin Costner plays one of the worlds minority of incredibly prolific yet destitute hit men. After a botched mission brought on by a mild case of brain and lung cancer he quits and returns home to Paris figuring hell patch things up with his ex (Connie Nielsen) and his teen daughter (Hailee Steinfeld from ""True Grit"") before he dies in a few months. Except Theres this other superspy (Amber Heard) a rising starlet of the CIA who has been sent to Europe to ""work with him"" which seems to mean racing around in hot rods in the kind of outfits Katy Perry would reject as too tarty while telling him which baddies to kill. To sweeten the offer to keep him working she has a super-secret serum thatll prolong his life. Hey wouldnt you allow some random trollup to inject your arm with mystery drugs? Despite being the go-to contractor hired by the CIA on save-the-planet jobs Ethan (Costner) lives in a dump that has been taken over by a family of African squatters. So he crashes with his ex Tina (Nielsen) who not having seen him in years and just after learning hes going to die soon naturally goes off to London and leaves him with their daughter. Hence the movies double-entendre title Ethans daughter thinks she just has to endure some unexpected time with papa whose spying career she doesnt know about but hes got some assassinating to do. Still he wants to be a good dad. So when hes 10 feet from the door of the guy he needs to kill he instead turns around and goes on an amusement-park ride with Zooey (Steinfeld). Later the kid calls him up asking for a spaghetti-sauce recipe -- because in this movie teens have never heard of Google. But Papa says hold on Hes torturing an Italian accountant for information and the hostage has some excellent ideas on marinara sauce. A car dealer who knows the accountant gets so used to being kidnapped by Ethan that at one point he simply climbs into the trunk of his own car in broad daylight on a busy street requesting that Ethan get him back by 430 so he can pick up his kids from school. When the movie is really funny is when its trying to be emotional. Teaching his daughter to dance Ethan puts on a slow-dance record. Better Its ""Make It With You."" Best He tells his ex-wife ""I love her the same way I love you."" I hope not buddy but then again this is France and maybe that sort of thing is legal. Far be it from me to give anything away but if youre hoping that this is the kind of movie that winds up with a gunfight at the prom you may be in luck. And you thought your dad was overprotective when you were a teen At least he probably fired frowns instead of bullets over your head.

Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday February 20 2014 1245 PM Title 3 Days to Kill Film Info PG-13 Language violence. Area theaters. Lets say youre Kevin Costner icon of the 1980s Academy Award-winning director a guy people were glad to see again in ""Man of Steel"" ""Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit"" and on the TV miniseries ""Hatfields amp; McCoys."" What should you avoid as you continue your comeback? Half-baked action flicks like ""3 Days to Kill."" Even during comebacks actors have to play to their strengths. This kind of elder-hard-ass stuff works better for actors like Liam Neeson who already had a taciturn image. No one was eager to see the farmer from ""Field of Dreams"" return to shoot a guys kneecaps. Ethan Renner (Kevin Costner) learns he has terminal cancer in the spy thriller ""3 Days to Kill."" This dreadful movie directed by the McDirector known as McG (""Charlies Angels"" ""This Means War"") features Costner in a 90s-style action drama. It only comes alive when the star briefly shows the casual looseness that once was his calling card. CIA field agent Ethan Renner (Costner) has spent his life crisscrossing the globe to off bad guys. He has ignored his family for years. His latest assignment is to be the trigger man in Paris reporting to a tough sexy spy named Vivi (an absurd Amber Heard). Amber Heard plays agent runner Vivi in ""3 Days to Kill."" She oversees Renner as he hunts for a Euro-bland villain called The Wolf whose operative The Albino is carrying around a dirty bomb and whose accountant The Accountant knows where everyone is. Even the villains nicknames sound like holdovers from Clinton-era flicks. Renner has just been told that the little theatrical cough he has is ""brain cancer thats moved to his lungs."" Aside from an occasional dry hack his ailment mostly causes blurry vision at inopportune moments. Nonetheless he has mere months to live and Vivi promises Renner shell give him wads of cash and supply him with a mysterious ""life-extending"" medicine -- if he takes down a certain number of The Wolfs men and The Wolf himself. Kevin Costner must hunt down a villain known as The Wolf in ""3 Days to Kill."" These kills conflict with Renners banal reunion with his family. His wife Christine (Connie Nielsen) and teenage daughter Zoey (Hailee Steinfeld) are sick of Renners secret-agent shenanigans and Zoey is nervous about prom at her Paris high school. The last-act connection between all these plot strands is laughable. The whole domestic-life-of-assassins angle comes straight from screenwriter Luc Bessons conveyer belt of genre junk (""Taken"" ""From Paris With Love"" ""The Family""). Its as contrived and forced as ever here. Kevin Costner and Connie Nielsen as his wife in ""3 Days to Kill."" (Julian Torres) Costner seems bored by most of the convoluted goings-on. As a screen presence he has always been mellow. That was his secret weapon in ""The Untouchables"" ""Bull Durham"" ""Dances with Wolves"" ""Tin Cup"" and even ""Robin Hood Prince of Thieves."" In 2008 he used his personality to juice up the politics-meets-Americana comedy ""Swing Vote"" and it looks like he may tap into it again in the upcoming comedy ""Draft Day."" In ""3 Days"" Costner appears to be just killing time until he can get back to what he does best. Hopefully this stage of his career is terminal. jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

But its actually an apt selling point since like its predecessor the Kevin Costner thriller combines tradecraft and relationship hijinks in equally ridiculous measures. Nevertheless a movie primarily distinctive as a jacobs ladder of choices that make less and less sense McGs latest is an ambitious disaster that tries to be two things at once -- an action movie and a domestic comedy - but does neither well. Costner (""Jack Ryan"") plays Ethan Renner a CIA ""lifer"" who is forced into retirement after being diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. With just months left to live Ethan sets his affairs in order and tries to make peace with his his ex-wife Christine (Connie Nielsen) and daughter Zoey (Hailee Steinfeld). But just as he insists that his work is no longer a distraction from his familial responsibilities CIA operative Vivi Delay (Amber Heard""gt;Amber Heard) makes him an offer he cant refuse kill a high-risk target in exchange for an experimental drug that may prolong his life. See video Kevin Costner Uses Gun to Get Spaghetti Recipe in 3 Days to Kill Trailer Before long Ethan is racing back and forth from assassinations to after-school meetups with his daughter and trying to finish assignments in time to fix their supper. But as he becomes more emotionally involved in Christine and Zoeys lives Ethan begins to question the value of extending his life especially when it seems to be for the purpose of inflicting more death. Superficially the notion of a covert operative trying to balance his professional and personal lives is one ripe with potential - and which has been explored to mixed effect already in movies like ""True Lies"" and of course ""This Means War."" But screenwriters Adi Hasak and Luc Besson who previously worked together on ""From Paris With Love"" have zero sense of how to combine humor with pathos instead opting for a dizzying tone that whips haphazardly from goofy dunce-dad scenarios to brutally violent shootouts to tearful reconciliations to vampy surrealism. Also read This Means War Review Spy vs. Spy Love Triangle Makes Peace With Its Frothiness Its bad enough that the basic concept doesnt make a damn lick of sense Vivi gives Ethan a drug that gives him debilitating hallucinations and then leaves him alone to kill a mysterious and incredibly dangerous criminal. But the characters are written with such disregard for anything resembling normal human reactions - such as when Zoey is angry at Ethan for not being angry at her - that their emotional non sequiturs actually conceal a few of the films many many logical flaws. But not all of them starting with the ""Magical Negro"" family that lives in Ethans Parisian apartment and is helpless to evict because of laws that protect squatters. Or why Amber Heard is a buttoned-up desk jockey in the opening scenes of the film but then transforms into a cross between Angelina Jolie in ""Wanted"" and a slightly less believable version of Dennis Rodman in ""Double Team"" complete with scene-to-scene changes in hair color. See photos 2014 Movie Preview 60 Upcoming Winter amp; Spring Films - From Paranormal Sequel to Transcendence You cant help but feel bad for Nielsen a formidable actress whose character here is relegated to pooh-poohing her husbands unreliability and then forgiving him unequivocally for showing mild interest (at best) in her and Zoey. But Steinfeld may have it worst of all playing a character that even a teenage girl would think is mercurial - like when Zoey loses her temper at Ethan for saving her from a sexual assault she barely remembers and immediately agrees to learn how to ride the bicycle she has told him repeatedly she hates. Whats worse is the notion that Christine and Zoey have simply been waiting for Ethan to re-enter their lives and Ethan merely needed to show up - always late and never fully invested -- in order to secure the domestic bliss that completes his life. But then again that almost serves as a metaphor for Costners career of late all he needs to do is make a demonstration of effort in a few high-profile projects seem to care and were ready to re-anoint him a movie star. Admittedly the actors recent turns in ""Man of Steel"" and ""Jack Ryan"" were perhaps deservedly acclaimed if also in movies whose overall merits they overshadowed. But if numbskull dreck like this is exemplary of the kind of entertainment we get in return for that renewed adulation Ill say no thanks. Ultimately ""3 Days to Kill"" is almost crazy enough to be appealing as camp and certainly has enough leftfield one-liners to keep midnight moviegoers shouting dialogue for years; but as anything remotely serious or engaging the only thing the movie actually kills is the time and money you spent watching it.

"Review 3 Days to Kill 2.5 stars Article Comments () Things to do >> Movies >> Article Review 3 Days to Kill 2.5 stars SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments RELATED NEWS Interview Director McG Top 5 Costner films Costner 2014 big year By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Thu Feb 20 2014 1103 AM Anyone with children can relate to the struggles that Kevin Costners character faces in ""3 Days to Kill"" as he juggles the challenges of raising a teenage daughter with the need to assassinate a small army of bad guys. Oh. Or not. The film is directed by McG but co-written and produced by Luc Besson who mined similar territory in the ""Taken"" films. But where Liam Neeson was trying to save his daughter in the first one Costners just trying to keep his daughter out of high-school trouble. Not surprisingly there are a lot more attempts at laughs in ""3 Days to Kill."" They dont always succeed and neither does the movie as it bounces between high-intensity action and daddy-daughter humor and heart. But it is kind of nice to see Costner back in the game again. What is it about the guy that people like? OK heres a two-word answer ""Bull Durham."" For audiences of a certain age weve been looking for a return of that spark that aw-shucks guys guy vibe that somehow curdled into arrogance along the way. Lately hes been good in supporting roles in ""Man of Steel"" and ""Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit."" In ""3 Days to Kill"" hes the lead and if its not a return to his long-ago form at least its a step in that direction. Costner plays Ethan Renner a long-time grizzled Secret Service agent who years before left his wife Christine (Connie Nielsen) and daughter Zoey (Hailee Steinfeld). Hes moved around the world ever since killing bad guys getting the job done. But an assignment that goes sideways leads to a dire diagnosis Ethan is dying of cancer. So he decides to get his house in order and go to Paris where Christine and Zoey live and reconnect with his family for whatever time he has left. They reluctantly let him back in -- with the understanding that he no longer work for the Secret Service. Sure thing. And then. ... Vivi Delay (Amber Heard) is a top-shelf agent who has to take out a mysterious villain named the Wolf (Richard Sammel). She wants Ethan to do the job and offers him the one thing he needs in exchange an experimental medicine that might extend his life. From there its mostly a matter of brutally killing a bunch of bad guys with the occasional phone call from Zoey interrupting him. Shes a mess manic about bad hair and boyfriends. So when Christine goes on a business trip and leaves her in Ethans charge the troubles only escalate. Some of the back-and-forth is funny (Marc Andreoni is good as a thug who loves his family and gives Ethan some good advice between taking beatings). Some of it isnt. And although its not impossible to mix humor and violence as ""Midnight Run"" proves it isnt easy -- as ""3 Days to Kill"" proves. Points for effort all the way around and welcome back Costner. Lets hope things get better from here. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm. Twitter twitter.com/goodyk. 3 Days to Kill Director McG.
