Depp persuaded him to publish. Oh and why not make a film? The result is surprisingly un-addled an affectionate from-the-heart tribute to Thompson (who died in 2005) - though perhaps more conventional than any film associated with him has any right to be. While it features plenty of mild boozy havoc-wreaking youll find no uppers or downers here no rage no cocaine no mescaline and virtually no loss of motor skills.Using super-strength bleach writer/director Bruce Robinson (Withnail and I) has disinfected the novel into an origins story - a kind of Gonzo The Early Years. Depp plays Thompsons alter ego (as he did in Fear and Loathing) Paul Kemp a failed 30-year-old novelist who washes up in the office of a two-bit tourist rag in Puerto Rico. Ive got no voice. I dont know how to write like me he complains. This is Thompson before he invented gonzo journalism - that frenzy of non-fiction-fiction he aimed at those he believed to be crooks and imposters. How does Kemp find his writing style? Dropping acid for the first time lights the fire. The story is stoked by a run-in with a corrupt property developer (Aaron Eckhart) and his distractingly gorgeous girlfriend (Amber Heard).Its funny as hell in places and touchingly warm. But like Thompson without gonzo The Rum Diary is directionless and a little lacking in tone. And you have to ask if Depp - at 48 - is a fraction too old to play 30. Im not sure. He looks in better shape than men half his age. But that unassailable unshakaeble unruffled charisma does make him hard to buy as a man on his uppers. Caution this may leave you hankering for a little cynical subversive bile.

(Photo Peter Mountain/Courtesy of Film District) We Hunter S. Thompson freaks never stop hoping for a filmmaker to come along and re-create the buzz of reading him in that short-but-so-sweet era when his prose was as exhilarating as rock and roll and a damn sight funnier before the drugs and booze made him not just batty but incapable of stringing together two coherent thoughts. And what a time this would be for that great Thompson movie what with Occupy Wall Street gleefully settled in and driving our mayor to splutter more than ever like a high-school principal with Nixonian notions of civil liberties. But The Rum Diary has no mighty gonzo wind. Even with a push from its Thompson-worshipping star Johnny Depp it leaves our freak flag limp. Writer-director Bruce Robinson was smart to throw out a lot of his source material a listless autobiographical novel that Thompson began in 1959 at age 22 and didnt publish until 1998 when he was too far gone to make it better. Robinsons idea is conventional but good to introduce Thompson (here called Paul Kemp and played by Depp) as a drunk and a failed writer with no particular political convictions and dramatize how he found his outrageand with it his voice his gonzo. The setting is San Juan Puerto Rico where Kemp has just taken a job with a failing English-language newspaper. The Caribbean is changing fast Cuba has fallen to Castro and developers have their eyes on other rum-soaked islands with beachfront property. The gap between the wealthy and the working class is widening. Kemp wakes up on his first full day in town with a vicious hangover stumbles past a tumultuous picket line into the office (run by Richard Jenkins in a garish toupee) and instantly attracts the attention of a wealthy slickster named Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart) whos looking for a skilled writer to plant favorable stories about a proposed development. Theres a lot of money to be made from other peoples resources. The puzzler is why on Earth Sanderson and his cronies would think Kemp is the man to carry their water. Depp is playing a hybrid of the young and old Thompson and looks bleary and apatheticand hes too busy ogling Sandersons fiancee (Amber Heard whos like an android fashioned to resemble Scarlett Johansson) even to make eye contact with anyone else. Around this central nonstorymeant to account for Kemps rebirth as a journalist committed to afflicting the powerfulRobinson stages various drug-and-alcohol-fueled misadventures with Michael Rispoli as a cruddy photographer and Giovanni Ribisi as the human embodiment of the D.T.s a blotchy cadaverous creature dispensing hallucinogenics and squeaky non sequiturs. Rollicking car chases colorful carousing in tropical settings psychedelics jags with outlandish special effects It should be just what the Doctor of Gonzo ordered. But Robinson doesnt have the gonzo touch. Even if his Withnail amp; I featured a spectacularly dissolute antihero it was soaked through with cold rain and the melancholy specter of alcoholism and failure. To work The Rum Diary would need to make the case for all the excesses that killed Thompson and Robinsons heart (or talent) isnt in it. The movie builds to a cockfight the winnings from which will allow Kemp to publish a final excoriating issue of the newspaperexcept that you cant stage cockfights in movies nowadays so the shots are brief and Animal Welfare was reportedly on hand to ensure that the birds never actually touched. No Im not calling for the return of cockfighting but a cockfight without cockfighting is a better metaphor for the filmmakers impotence than any I could dream up. The Occupy Wall Street people will get a bigger populist boost from Tower Heist a shameless but exuberantly well-done caper comedy about employees of an apartment building for the super-wealthy who band together to rob the smug Madoffian billionaire (Alan Alda) who gobbled up among other things their pension fund. Ben Stiller as a micromanager with a chip on his shoulder and Eddie Murphy as a calculating street thief show off two of the best fastballs in comedy and Tea Leonis best scene as an FBI agentdrunk both sloppy and bluntmakes you wish she had more. The screenplay (credited to Ted Griffin and Jeff Nathanson) is packed with nifty gags and director Brett Ratner stages a sequence involving a sports car dangling from the top of a skyscraper that makes us all Scottie Ferguson in Vertigo our eyes making like yo-yos.

Peter Mountain/Film District/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Gallery The top 10 highest-grossing films Johnny Depp was good friends with legendary gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson and has played variations on him twice - in Terry Gilliams 1998 ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" and now in ""The Rum Diary"" based on a semiautobiographical previously unpublished novel that Depp himself helped get into print in 1998.Depps Paul Kemp - a stand-in for Thompson - is a boozy American newspaperman slumming in Puerto Rico in 1960 for the San Juan Star. Anti-American sentiment is running high; cutthroat US business interests are running rampant. Paul ends up an improbable crusader against those interests but not before gallivanting gonzo-style with a pair of newspaper buddies (well played by Giovanni Ribisi and Michael Rispoli) who make him seem almost sane by comparison.Depp is disappointingly recessive here as he often is when hes playing characters who dont have an antic streak. (See or better yet dont see ""The Tourist."") One might have thought that his connection to Thompson would bring out some more vibrant colorations. Maybe Depp just doesnt want to upstage his hero.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Oct. 28 2011 600AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 240PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English An episodic tale of journalistic muck-raking romance and copious substance abuse set in Puerto Rico in the early sixties The Rum Diary features a dream team of idiosyncratic talents. The writer-director is Bruce Robinson of the 1987 booze-up Withnail amp; I who disappeared from filmmaking in disgust almost 20 years ago when his third film Jennifer Eight was taken away from him by his studio. The Rum Diary script is based on a novel from the late gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson begun in the early sixties and not published until 1998. Screen grab from the online trailer for the film ""The Rum Diary"" starring Johnny Depp Movies The Rum Diary The official trailer The film stars Thompsons Hollywood pal Johnny Depp returning to indie film roots from too many years of looting the box office in the blockbuster Pirates of the Caribbean movies. With a secondary cast that includes Richard Jenkins Giovanni Ribisi and Aaron Eckhart all portents look good except the news that the studio sat on the film for three years before releasing it. The commercial concerns about The Rum Diary arent hard to understand Neither family friendly nor rude and crude enough for The Hangover fans the movie is a mildly disreputable old-fashioned tale that seems sealed in amber as much as soaked in rum. Robinsons creation of a world of tropical rot (shot with a 16mm camera with natural light in San Juan locations) is persuasive enough and his literate dialogue occasionally sparkles but the stakes never feel particularly urgent here. Thats especially true of Depps diffident mildly comic bumbling performance with a default puzzled blankness occasionally transforming into a bug-eyed double-take. The opening scene sees Depp as journalist Paul Kemp awakening in a trashed Puerto Rican hotel room with the arrival of room service. The hard-drinking New York reporter has faked his resume to take refuge at the under-funded San Juan Star in a job no one else wants covering Americans visiting bowling alleys and horoscope writing. While unexplained protestors regularly mill around the front doors of the newspaper The San Juan Star studiously ignores the news for social columns and tourist gossip. The supporting cast of journalistic riffraff is uniformly excellent The editor is a bewigged neurotic (Jenkins) the staff photographer is the slovenly Sala (Michael Rispoli) and the apocalyptic religion reporter is Moburg (Ribisi) a Hitler-admiring zombie who has had ""the entire substructure of his brain destroyed by alcohol."" The core of the story is about Kemps awakening from naivete to insight (though Depp is perhaps two decades too old to seem convincingly naive). The snake in this inebriated Eden is slick PR man Sanderson (Eckhart) who wants Kemp to write promotional copy for a new environment-despoiling resort complex built on a military base. Bewitched by Sandersons sexy impulsive girlfriend Chenault (Amber Heard) Kemp becomes beholden to Sanderson - after hes bailed out of jail provided him with cash the loan of a red Corvette and a chance to be around Chenault. The movies strongest sequence is a sinister evening during a carnival dance which changes the relationship between the two men and sends Kemp on a course of rather conventional and not entirely convincing redemption. Essentially an affectionate and personal project to honour Thompsons memory The Rum Diary occasionally strains to evoke the journalists surreal black humour. A scene in which Moburg provides Kemp with a military-grade hallucinogen evokes an unhelpful comparison to the more riotous hallucinations of Depps other Hunter S. Thompson film Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998). While that earlier movie desperately wanted to blow your mind The Rum Diary is content to tickle your feelings of nostalgia.

"The Rum Diary review Depp goes gonzo once again |       NJ.com comments The Rum Diary review Depp goes gonzo once again Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on October 28 2011 at 752 AM View/Post Comments (FILM DISTRICT)Amber Heard and Johnny Depp get to know each other in ""The Rum Diary."" Well this explains ""The Tourist."" One of the reasons a good actor does expensive stupid movies like that is the increased clout and fattened bank accounts that help him get small difficult movies made. And so having done his hard time in Hollywood Johnny Depp now brings us his indie ""The Rum Diary"" based on a novel by the late Hunter S. Thompson Depps long-time friend and inspiration. Its a love letter. Unfortunately other peoples love letters dont always make for particularly interesting reading. The book (which was written early in Thompsons career but only published later) is the fictionalized account of one of his first (and last) straight journalism jobs toiling away in the early `60s for an English-language rag in Puerto Rico. At the time the book was about romance and alcohol; now its presented as a sort of Birth of Gonzo document as we see its hero avoid work embrace psychedelic drugs rage against Nixon and strike up an adventurous friendship ""Fear and Loathing"" style with a portly counterpart. Give Depp points for playing Kemp as a character and not merely as a mumbling mimicry of Dr. H.S.T. himself. Although technically Depps too old for the part he looks great - I want those wraparound shades - and avoids his usual scene-chomping choices. And allow Depp major credit for bringing Bruce Robinson aboard as director an actor/filmmaker who seems like both an odd choice (his last feature was the dull thriller ""Jennifer Eight"" in 1992) and the perfect one (he began his career with the delightful dissolute ""Withnail and I""). But there was a reason ""The Rum Diary"" didnt find a publisher until a late-in-life Thompson resurgence and its clearer still in this adaptation - theres no real drama here. Kemp is given (and misses) his big chance to sell out but not out of any real action or even conscious thought on his part; a woman appears disappears then reappears but the reason for the pairs connection is nonexistent. Its not just Kemp whos aimless but the whole film. Depp is fine and theres an authentic Third-World grunginess to the island scenes; Richard Jenkins is great as always as Kemps cranky editor and Aaron Eckhart brings his Fearless Fosdick chin and charming sleaze to the role of a shady developer. Intermittently interesting but well-intentioned it almost makes up for ""The Tourist."" But itd have to be a hell of a lot better to make me forgive the last ""Pirates"" movie. Ratings note The film contains drug and alcohol abuse strong language and sexual situations. The Rum Diary (R) Film District (118 min.) Directed by Bruce Robinson. With Johnny Depp Aaron Eckhart.

Thompson. Peter Mountain/FilmDistrict hide caption toggle caption Peter Mountain/FilmDistrict The Rum Diary Director Bruce Robinson Genre Adventure Drama Running Time 120 minutes Rated R; for language brief drug use and sexuality With Johnny Depp Giovanni Ribisi and Aaron Eckhart Watch Clips From The Rum Diary - Contradictory Points Of View Contradictory Points Of View Credit FilmDistrict From The Rum Diary - The Red Convertible The Red Convertible Credit FilmDistrict From The Rum Diary - Trip Of The Tongue Trip Of The Tongue Credit FilmDistrict Noteworthy for what must be the least psychedelic acid-trip scene ever filmed The Rum Diary struggles to seem both authentic and outrageous. The movie is Johnny Depps latest tribute to his friend and inspiration journalist Hunter S. Thompson and should interest members of either mans cult. Everyone else will be wondering how ""gonzo"" could be so humdrum. Depp has been boosting this property a long time. He discovered Thompsons 1961 novel then unpublished while hanging with the writer in preparation for playing him in 1998s Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. The actor helped get the book a publisher and more than a decade later persuaded retired writer-director Bruce Robinson to adapt it into this film. Robinson made the alcohol-soaked Withnail amp; I a 1987 cult film that -- like Thompsons novel -- is semi-autobiographical. He seems a logical choice to direct The Rum Diary and he hasnt done a bad job. But Thompsons blend of self-indulgence and self-righteousness is hard to transfer from page to screen and Depps low-key Thompson impression is emblematic of a movie that too often underplays the absurdities that might enliven it. Thompsons on-screen alter ego is Paul Kemp who arrives in Puerto Rico from New York to take a job at a struggling English-language newspaper. Hes stinking drunk before he ever meets his new boss Lotterman (Richard Jenkins) and is soon living with a photographer (Michael Rispoli) whose passions are boozing and cockfighting. Their occasional third roommate (Giovanni Ribisi) is the tales wildest caricature a dissolute Hitler fan who trades in ""470 proof"" alcohol and a new drug so mind-blowing he says that the FBI is ""giving it to Communists."" Initially Kemp has no ambition and few principles. He identifies himself to Lotterman as a politically ""in the middle"" although theres nothing moderate about the comments he makes as he watches his future nemesis Richard Nixon debate JFK on TV. Kemp soon finds himself moved to action by two things the plight of the islands locals who enter the beachfront enclaves of privileged whites only as servants; and flirtatious blond beauty Chenault (Amber Heard) whos generally as underdressed as her character is underdeveloped. i Flirtatious beauty Chenault (Amber Heard) catches Kemps eye when he visits the beachfront mansion of a local businessman. Peter Mountain/FilmDistrict hide caption toggle caption Peter Mountain/FilmDistrict Flirtatious beauty Chenault (Amber Heard) catches Kemps eye when he visits the beachfront mansion of a local businessman. Peter Mountain/FilmDistrict Chenault lives with smug hustler Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart) who extols the immense value of the islands resort-worthy (and tax-free) land. He recruits Kemp to join a team that plans to develop a nearby island thats pristine -- except for the bombs lobbed at it during U.S. Navy target practice. Kemp signs on it seems mostly so he can see more of Chenault with whom hes supposedly in love. Also Sanderson loans him a little red Corvette. Neither the real estate deal nor the newspaper gig last long. But a weirdly earnest final note which doesnt distinguish between Kemp and Thompson announces that the Puerto Rico sojourn was the beginning of a brilliant career. Bad behavior doesnt necessarily lead to good writing of course. But dramatizing the act of putting words on paper is a lost cause. So instead we hear Kemps voice-over commentary on obese racist American tourists and watch him get so drunk that desperate to rehydrate he drinks from a goldfish bowl. Kemp usually wears sunglasses and so does the movie This is a rare trip to the Caribbean during which the sun rarely dazzles. Thats a nifty ironic touch but also a metaphor for the movies shortfall The Rum Diary is too muted to convey the intensity that propelled Thompson past most of the other magazine feature writers of his boozy era.

Thompson Besides being the familiar appellation for a potent alcoholic liquor the word ""rum"" can also mean -- its a colloquial Briticism -- that something is a little off a tad peculiar. Both definitions of the word apply to ""The Rum Diary"" a meandering comic drama based on an early semi-autobiographical novel by legendary gonzo journalist and hard drinker Hunter S. Thompson. Johnny Depp who produced and stars in the film was a longtime friend of the Thompson. (The writer committed suicide in 2005 by shooting himself in the head.) Depp previously played Thompsons alter ego Raoul Duke in ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" a 1998 Terry Gilliam movie based on another of Thompsons books. This time around the Thompsonesque character whom Depp plays is called Paul Kemp a scruffy journalist and boozehound who moves to Puerto Rico in the waning days of the Eisenhower era to take a job as a reporter at a struggling English-language newspaper in San Juan. In between turning out fluffy stories ordered up by his toupee-wearing editor (Richard Jenkins) on pale plump tourists enjoying themselves while holidaying on the island Paul quaffs copious quantities of rum and befriends a scruffy set of colleagues that includes a photographer (Michael Rispoli) and a drug-addicted former reporter (Giovanni Ribisi). A plot such as it is kicks in when Paul meets a Sanderson a smooth-talking ex-reporter turned real estate developer who is plotting to build a huge resort on a pristine piece of beachfront land. Will Paul be co-opted by the corrupt Sandersons sweet talk and money or will he do whats right and expose the developer and his corrupt cronies? The movie never finds a rhythm though it does improve once the plot starts to build. Director-screenwriter Bruce Robinson (""Withnail and I"") effectively captures the contrasts between the sun-soaked privileged side and the rum-soaked seamier side of San Juan life but the movies major characters remain hazy and mutable. Depp while always fun to watch phoned this one in. He has played this character before -- think of Paul as an updated Captain Jack minus the dreads -- and relies heavily on a sneer and a quirked eyebrow. Eckhart is amusing equal parts suave and sleaze as the developer while Amber Heard playing his sex kitten girlfriend hasnt much of a role other than to look fetching which she indeed does. This being a movie based on a Thompson work there is the requisite hallucinatory sequence involving drug taking. Its actually one of the funnier bits in the movie (Paul thinks a friends tongue is lengthening astonishingly) going on just long enough to score comically but without stretching on too long. Hardcore Thompson fans (and Depp fanatics) will want to see ""Rum Diary."" For anyone else if the choice is between seeing the movie and lingering for two hours over a tasty rum cocktail with a friend while solving the worlds problems (or discussing fashion or sports) consider the latter.

Thompson By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Updated Comments Reprints amp; Permissions Given his friendship with Hunter S. Thompson and his role in the publication of Thompsons novel it makes perfect sense for Johnny Depp to play his surrogate in The Rum Diary.By Peter Mountain Film District / GK FilmsIn Puerto Rico Amber Heard and Johnny Depp get close.EnlargeCloseBy Peter Mountain Film District / GK FilmsIn Puerto Rico Amber Heard and Johnny Depp get close.Sponsored LinksDepp adroitly captures the ""gonzo"" spirit of the journalist/author/ingester of many substances. Much of the dialogues offbeat wit seems to come straight from Thompsons book. That distinctive dialogue is the movies greatest asset.The Rum Diary was inspired by Thompsons experiences in 1960 in Puerto Rico. Though the story is not strictly biographical the characters in the book and film are based on those he met.PHOTOS This week at the moviesDepp discovered the unpublished manuscript when visiting Thompsons Colorado home in the 1990s. Together they decided to publish the novel.So clearly The Rum Diary is a boozy labor of love and tribute to Thompson who died in 2005 and a celebration of his unique voice. But as a movie it is uneven and lacks cohesion.About the movieThe Rum Diary   1/2 out of fourStars Johnny Depp Michael Rispoli Aaron Eckhart Richard Jenkins Amber Heard Giovanni Ribisi Director Bruce RobinsonDistributor The Film District Rating R for language brief drug use and sexuality Running time 1 hour 59 minutes Opens Friday nationwideThe story which exposes a corrupt scheme to build a massive hotel on unblemished land lacks the sense of crazed fun in Terry Gilliams 1998 adaptation of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. But then The Rum Diary was Thompsons first novel written in 1959 when he was only 22.Depp plays Paul Kemp a lackadaisical writer tired of conventional American life in the Eisenhower era. Kemp takes a job in San Juan at a small newspaper run by a cynical editor. He befriends Sala (Michael Rispoli) a zany photographer and the two embark on a series of rum-soaked adventures. Kemp also falls for the sexy Chenault (Amber Heard) the girlfriend of Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart) a wily American developer who wants to turn the most pristine parts of Puerto Rico into a tropical haven for the wealthy.Sanderson sizes up Kemps smarts and tenuous situation and makes him an offer he finds hard to refuse. Kemp is paid handsomely in exchange for writing glowing reports about Sandersons project. He is faced with an ethical decision use his writing talents for the ruthless capitalists gain or ""take the bastards down."" He doesnt really do either however.Shot on location in Puerto Rico the story takes detours to local bars and a harrowing hallucinogenic moment in which the dissipated journalist Moburg (Giovanni Ribisi) gives Sala and Kemp an unnamed drug. They put drops of it in their eyes and Kemp watches as Salas tongue grows into a devilish snake. This weirdly comic bit feels more like classic Thompson.While Depp captures Thompsons spirit and has some undeniable funny moments there are others in which Pirates of the Caribbeans Captain Jack seeps through without the accent in his reactions and even underlying his slurring vocal cadence.The tale was no doubt meant to convey Kemp/Thompsons boozy aimlessness but the film feels disjointed and meandering as a result.

(AP Photo/Film District Peter Mountain) Many men of middle age who fancy themselves writers probably would cite Hunter S. Thompson as a main influence in their professional lives. What reporter hasnt dreamed of writing uncensored and with alcohol and hallucinogens about the insanity of politics sports and modern times?The film ""Rum Diary"" is a good account written by Thompson of how a kid from Louisville Ky. and an ex-Army grunt went from Thompson to Doctor Gonzo. Johnny Depp stars as reporter Paul Kemp who travels to Puerto Rico in 1960 to take a job at a struggling English-language newspaper. It is operated by seasoned expatriates (Michael Rispoli Giovanni Ribisi) running from past indiscretions and present addictions.With a crusader persona developing Kemp is chagrined to find out that the papers editor (Richard Jenkins) is concerned only with protecting his job which means hes concerned only with allowing the paper to be used to promote U.S. commercial interests. Throw in a former reporter who has gone over to the dark side of public relations (Aaron Eckhart) and his beautiful girlfriend (Amber Heard) and you have the plot for adventure. Throw in massive amounts of booze and some illegal drugs and you have a Hunter Thompson adventure.Depp shows again that he truly understands Thompson by delivering a nuanced performance that is remarkably different but subliminally similar from the wonderfully outrageous turn he provided in ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas."" The supporting actors are strong especially longtime character actor Rispoli who shines as the reluctant photographer who joins Kemp in his crusades and escapades. Director Bruce Robinson paces the movie far too slowly to capture even a hint of Thompsons adrenalized style. Still if youd like to see one version of the story about how the real Thompson became the famous public Thompson ""The Rum Diary"" is a solid and entertaining telling of that tale.""The Rum Diary""Three stars (out of four)  Rating R  Run time 150  Content Brief drug use language sexual situations Find theaters and showtimes for The Rum Diary Oct 27 2011 (...)

Thompsons alter ego a revered journalist. Much talent went into ""The Rum Diary"" Hunter S. Thompson wrote the book Johnny Depp stars and Bruce Robinson who did ""Withnail and I"" directs. So in the true spirit of the 60s it was pretty much guaranteed to be a disappointment. This is a fitfully amusing superhero origin story set in 1960 Puerto Rico where Thompsons alter ego newspaperman Paul Kemp (Thompsons friend Depp) makes acquaintance with psychedelic drugs dangerous women and the Lex Luthor-ish countenance of Richard M. Nixon. The superpower Kemp will harness is his writing style and at the end we are told that he will wind up ""one of Americas most revered journalists"" in an example of the unbearable genuflection that set up Thompsons 2005 self-destruction. (It was a protracted murder-suicide Thompson had slain his own talent by degrees over the previous 30 years.) The legend of Thompson is immortal though and itll fall to each generation to jam him into its own mold. Depp and Robinsons view is that Thompson was like a mullet a party in the back but all business upfront. Mainly he is a liberal crusader -- equal parts Bob Dylan and Bob Woodward. The halo doesnt sit well on a man of pure anarchy. Thompson was a giddy knife thrower the Don Rickles of Haight-Ashbury. Though he was a man of the left his metier was put-down and hyperbole not the high-risk expose. (In ""The Rum Diary"" he must go on the run because he breaks a confidentiality agreement forced on him by an oily fixer played by Aaron Eckhart.) Such are Thompsons plotting abilities that here we find he couldnt even imagine how hard-hitting news stories are made Pauls big scoop is that developers are starting a p.r. campaign to back their plan to block off yet more beach from the people with a hotel. This economic model is known as ""Puerto Rico."" Paul is also the least-likely least-experienced least-reliable p.r. man in San Juan and yet the Eckhart character recruits him and hands him the keys to a flashy car along with a wad of cash. Whats the point of Pauls outrage? In the climax he tries to get his busted newspaper to print one more edition to play up his story on the hotel but as his crusty editor (Richard Jenkins) has already explained to him nobody cares. Many of Thompsons most memorable riffs were just pharmaceutical joyrides that had nothing to do with politics but putting an acid trip on film defeated Terry Gilliam in ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" and it still isnt a lot of fun to watch others get wasted. If (in Thompsons words) its true that when the going gets weird the weird turn pro the party scenes here are minor-league. Paul gets drunk and blows flaming gasoline on a cop he nearly zooms a Corvette into the ocean and (in a completely pointless scene) he meets a hermaphrodite witch doctor. The glory of HST was his hilarious language and Depps monotone growl is an able steward to Thompsons free-range disgust his paranoid ravings his loathing and/or fear. But a string of colorful word fireworks do not a movie make. Anyway the film admits Thompson had not yet fully developed his blazing Gonzo panache. (The most successful attempt to put this on-screen still belongs to Bill Murray in 1980s ""Where the Buffalo Roam""). Paul may be played by one of the most charismatic actors alive but for the most part he is just another boozy hack.

Thompson. Starring Johnny Depp Amber Heard Giovanni Ribisi Aaron Eckhart Amaury Nolasco Richard Jenkins Michael Rispoli Marshall Bell Bill Smitrovich Jason Smith Director Bruce Robinson Running time 200 Release Opened Oct 28 2011  Editorial Review Going gonzo in Puerto RicoBy Ann HornadayFriday Oct 28 2011As a posthumous valentine to his old friend Hunter S. Thompson Johnny Depps adaptation of ""The Rum Diary"" exudes a cheery beery sense of warmth and affection. Depp - who plays Thompsons alter ego Paul Kemp - coaxed writer-director Bruce Robinson (""Withnail and I"") out of retirement to bring Thompsons long-unadapted book to the screen with mixed results. Brimming with Thompsons alcohol-drenched antics observational wit and gift for the acidly apposite phrase ""The Rum Diary"" also suffers from a creakily episodic structure and a fatally underwritten flimsily acted supporting role. No doubt Thompsons fans will savor Depps impersonation of the authors cracked clipped cadences - perfected in ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" and Alex Gibneys documentary ""Gonzo"" - in a shaggy-dog story that amounts to an origin story of what would come to be Thompsons signature journalistic style. Viewers coming to ""The Rum Diary"" with visions of Jack Sparrow cavorting in their heads may find less to value although Thompsons tale of lust larceny and derring-do in 1960s Puerto Rico bursts with piratical brio - not to mention several bottles of the eponymous elixir (yo-ho-ho doesnt even begin to describe it). As ""The Rum Diary"" opens budding-novelist Kemp has just come to San Juan to work at the teetering English-language newspaper the Daily News arriving hung over at his first meeting with his boss the aggressively toupee-ed Mr. Lotterman (Richard Jenkins). Urged to write anodyne puff pieces on the local tourist scene Kemp instead turns in biting portraits of American cultural colonialists he dubs the ""Great Whites . . . beasts of obesity"" who prefer spending time in their hotels bowling alleys than seeing the native byways of the island. Before long Kemp meets a PR man named Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart) whose modernist beach bungalow and snazzy sports car turn Kemps head almost as much as his girlfriend an inaccessible icon of blonde perfection named Chenault (Amber Heard). The plot grows ever plottier with Kemp eventually enlisting his two friends Sala (Michael Rispoli) and Moburg (Giovanni Ribisi) in a scheme that involves a cock fight a break-in and a visit to a hermaphroditic oracle. Robinson infuses ""The Rum Diary"" with a breezy capering energy letting his camera languish as lovingly on Kemps summer whites and Ray-Bans as on the gorgeous junglelike scenery of Puerto Rico where the movie was filmed. To his credit Depp tones down the Thompson impersonation especially in the films genuinely affecting final scenes when the source of what would become Thompsons reliably lacerating indignation come into clear focus. The fact that his voice came by way of a hallucinogenic drug that he and Sala take one rainy night doesnt tempt Robinson to get trippy with the visuals; with the exception of one hilarious vision he plays even that scene straight. Rispoli and Ribisi tuck into their supporting roles with louche relish although Moburgs addled worship of Adolf Hitler is problematically played for laughs in a story that finds outrage in the casual racism of American corporate hegemonists. The weakest link here is Heard who possesses the icy cool of Kim Novak but whose character never quite comes into fuller focus than as a hyper-sexualized object of desire. For all ""The Rum Diarys"" meandering pace and lack of edge theres inarguable pleasure to be had simply in hearing Thompsons deathless prose rattled off like so much dyspeptic poetry from the ""blackheads like Braille"" on Moburgs nose to Salas wistful observation that ""some days are two sizes too small."" More to the point theres a sweetness in considering Thompson on the verge of creating his own myth before it locked him into self-indulgent mannerisms. ""I dont know how to write like me"" Kemp meekly admits to Chenault at one point. Eventually of course he did and ""The Rum Diary"" goes a long sportively discursive way to show how one writer found a voice that he himself described as ""made of ink and rage.""Contains profanity brief drug use and sexuality.

Thompson. Depp played the gonzo journalists alter ego in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and has now both produced and starred in an adaptation of Thompsons The Rum Diary once again playing a character who is a lightly fictionalized version of Thompson himself. Its probably only a matter of time before Depp stars in an actual biopic of Thompson or changes his name to Johnny Hunter S. Thompson Depp. I wish I could say his enthusiasm for Thompsons work translated into a movie that makes us love the writer as much as Depp does but The Rum Diary doesnt capture it. What we have instead is a jaunty aimless series of mini-adventures about boozed-soaked writers in Puerto Rico in 1960 -- a promising subject to be sure but one that needs some focus and discipline to make it work on the screen. We have some fun with it but you can tell the actors (not to mention the characters) are having a lot more fun than we are. Thompson wrote the novel in the early 1960s (though it wasnt published until 1998) basing it on his own experiences writing for English-language newspapers in San Juan during Puerto Ricos industrialization and tourism boom. His avatar Paul Kemp (Depp) arrives at the offices of the San Juan Star with the promise of a reporting job. Kemp is unkempt a heavy drinker and frequent sufferer of hangovers but thats OK the once-noble Star is a fluff rag aimed at American tourists staffed by personnel at least as dysfunctional as Kemp and run by an unscrupulous editor named Lotterman (the always-watchable Richard Jenkins) who chomps a cigar and wears a boldly unconvincing toupee. Kemp fits right in. He becomes friends and roommates with the papers photo editor Bob Salas (Michael Rispoli) the sort of friendly lug who was born to be someones sidekick. The two drink potent moonshine concocted from materials stolen from the Bacardi distillery and take in some underground cockfights all the while traveling in Salas comically decrepit automobile. They are at times abetted by Moburg (Giovanni Ribisi) a fellow writer so permanently drunk stoned and delirious that he can literally barely stand up. Moburg is what rowdy-but-functioning alcoholics like Kemp eventually become if they arent careful. Kemp also falls in with Hal Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart) a rich entrepreneur looking to push some of the local poor people out of the way so he can build hotels on their land. Sanderson has a hot dangerous girlfriend Chenault (Amber Heard) who likes to flirt and isnt completely on board with Sandersons aggressive policy of exploitation and opportunism. You can smell trouble brewing in every corner and the film is largely composed of sequences in which Kemp and one or more of his associates get into scrapes often narrowly cheating death and/or the police. Some of these incidents are funny enough the way drunken shenanigans tend to be. But while everyone in the cast is lively the only characters who emerge as colorful are Lotterman and Moburg. The others are amiable but forgettable -- and that includes Kemp who benefits only slightly from Depps patented mischievous charm. Depp is a fan of Withnail and I the 1986 cult classic about a pair of underemployed drinkers in 1960s London and he went so far as to hire that films writer/director Bruce Robinson to make The Rum Diary. That sounds like a good match. So why is the result a shambling overlong near-miss? Johnny Depp Hunter S. Thompson Puerto Rico a lot of booze yeah this deserves to be better than just mediocre.

"Movie review The Rum Diary - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Johnny DeppMovie review The Rum DiaryJohnny Depp works hard to compensate for the struggling movie about a journalist in boozy 1960s Puerto Rico that is going through big changes.October 28 2011|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic From left Giovanni Ribisi Johnny Depp and Michael Rispoli star in the... (Film District )""The Rum Diary"" starring Johnny Depp as Paul Kemp a thinly disguised young Hunter S. Thompson chronicles the legendary journalists booze-soaked months in 1960s Puerto Rico in his pre-Gonzo days when he was a writer still struggling to find his voice worried that he might not actually have one. The voice issue is what troubles the film as well but in more significant ways a Thompson found his ""Rum Diary"" never does. That might have been a death sentence for the movie had not Depp been in such good form. Written and directed by Bruce Robinson the story begins with blinding sunshine a beautiful beach and a very bad hangover for Kemp (Depp) whos just about to start a new job at the local English-language newspaper in San Juan. The hotel room is a disaster but then apparently thats what happens when one brawls with a mini bar whose key has gone missing. In the film and the Thompson novel on which it is based Puerto Rico is a nation on the cusp. The narrative takes us on a breezy spin through its despoiling as the island goes from poverty-ridden but pristine tropical paradise to a blighted Eden with refineries polluting the oceans and hotels and casinos choking the beaches. Rum lots of it made being there more bearable for the likes of Kemp. Aaron Eckhart (""Thank You for Smoking"") is Sanderson a PR slick who greases the wheels and the palms around town putting the right people together to make the countrys transition to cosmopolitan hub profitable albeit painful. Thats one side of Kemps new world order. The other is in the grumbling bowels of the paper with Lotterman (Richard Jenkins sporting a bad rug and desperation) as its beleaguered editor. The newsroom is filled with reprobates most notably Moburg (Giovanni Ribisi) the religion/crime writer who hasnt seen a sober day in well no one remembers and Sala (Michael Rispoli) who sweats even when it isnt hot and is forever making plans to leave. Complicating matters is Sandersons girl a beautiful blond enigma named Chenault (Amber Heard channeling 50s bruised bombshell with power). Churning up friction in the streets are the Puerto Ricans increasingly displaced and losing their grip on the country. Kemp is the man in the middle the cool center in the growing chaos with everything collapsing around him. In every move Depp makes you believe this was a passion project for the actor one he dedicates to Thompson. You can see it as he turns down the mania of the Thompson he portrayed in Terry Gilliams ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" in 1998 to create a man made more genteel and more introspective by his youth and insecurities. ""Rum Diary"" also seemed a natural fit for Robinson though it required luring the screenwriter back into the directors chair after considerable time away. Having launched his career with his own counterculture manifesto exposing the drug- and flea-infested British Bohemian underbelly in 1987s ""Withnail amp; I"" Robinson was something of a kindred spirit to the authority-bashing Thompson. But with Robinson melding Thompsons characters streamlining story lines adding others the novels essential power has been lost in translation. Where Thompson gave us skillfully observed substance Robinson gives us well-crafted veneer. That comes as a surprise given the achingly intelligent feel for the material Robinson displayed in his Oscar-nominated screenplay for ""The Killing Fields"" for example. Still the film is beautifully rendered. Shot on location and better for it ""Rum Diary"" director of photography Dariusz Wolskis (""Pirates of the Caribbean"" ""Alice in Wonderland"") lens makes Puerto Rico itself one of the main attractions with endless beaches and a deep blue sea a weathered city feeling its decay new construction sites breaking the horizon lush plant life pressing all around. Even the poverty has an appeal. Likewise the various production teams have managed to turn back the clock to beautiful effect from those linen suits that carry wrinkles so well especially when they are hanging off the shoulders of Eckhart and Depp to the vintage cars that include a pivotal 1959 red Chevy Corvette. It all serves as a seductive invitation to follow the various parties as they party around the clock a in high rises dive bars street carnivals bowling alleys a it literally never stops. Against that very busy canvas Depp quietly paints Kemps many interior occupations a the journalist observing the scene taking it all in ruminating then struggling to putting it all down in words. It just isnt quite enough to take off the rough edge a for that I guess there is always the rum. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESFor Hugo a big opening isnt necessarily betterDecember 1 2011Rum Diary was Hunter S.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> So it doesnt matter too much that The Rum Diary a semiautobiographical novel that Thompson wrote when he was 22 (see photo on book cover) isnt his finest work. Or that the film version finished two years ago but only now being released isnt classic cinema. But damn if the movie - a passion project for its star and co-producer Johnny Depp - isnt alive to the challenge of capturing the gonzo master in the act of inventing himself. That he did. And that Im pleased to report is something to see. Depp plays Thompson alter ego Paul Kemp a budding New York journalist soaking up sun and rum in Puerto Rico circa 1960 as a new hire on The San Juan Star a rag staffed by - in Thompsons words - ""wild young Turks who wanted to rip the world in half and start all over again"" and ""degenerates and hopeless losers who could barely write a postcard - loons and fugitives and dangerous drunks."" Kemp had found a home. The Rum Diary written and directed by Bruce Robinson expertly cannonballs into the grit and glam with raw exuberance. Robinson whose 1987 Withnail amp; I fully earns its immortal cult status excels with actors. Richard Jenkins is a hoot as Lotterman the editor with a bad rug and a worse temper. Lotterman can tell Kemp is lying when the writer describes his drinking as being ""at the upper end of social."" Kemp is soon hanging with such kindred spirits as the Stars sharp-tongued photographer Sala (the excellent Michael Rispoli) and lunatic Moberg (a scene-stealing Giovanni Ribisi) a former reporter living on the far edges of his personal acid trip. You may think that Depp 48 has passed his sell-by date to play a young Turk. You may be right. But his enthusiasm for all things Thompson - theyre longtime friends and native Kentuckians - helped get the novel published (in 1998) and the movie produced. Depps take on Thompson proxy Raoul Duke in 1998s Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is iconic. Hell Depp imbued the authors spirit into the voice of a lizard in the animated Rango. Kemp is Thompson unformed but Depp digs for the soul of the man and expertly reveals the defining details. If The Rum Diary has a plot - and thats debatable - it hinges on Kemps involvement with unscrupulous American business interests personified by Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart in top form) a smooth-talking bastard using Kemps press cred to procure a fishy real estate deal to exploit the island. As bait he dangles his fiancee Chenault played by Amber Heard with enough come-on carnality to singe the screen. Watching Depp cruise Heard with his eyes or in a red Corvette generates a swirl of color and erotic heat - deep bow to cinematographer Dariusz Wolski - but cant disguise the films predictable destination. At best diverting at worst drearily conventional The Rum Diary is pre-gonzo Thompson before the fusion of fact and trippy fantasy that flowered into a brilliant delirium. But the seeds are there ready to yield a harvest of fear and loathing. The trouble with The Rum Diary on page and screen is that its only a tease a curio of a time when Thompson wasnt ready yet to rip the world in half and start again.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + The Rum Diary has been retroactively Hunter S. Thompson-ized. And not for the better.Back in the early 1960s well before he ascended to fame as the author of 1971s ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and the sardonic face of gonzo journalism Thompson wrote a novel about his days working for a two-bit newspaper in San Juan Puerto Rico. The book finally came out in 1998 an enjoyable read and very much a young mans work filled with youthful scorn and self-disgust. It doesnt have much to do with the later writing; for one thing narrator Paul Kemps drug of choice is still booze.But that wont do for the hordes of Thompson acolytes who expect drug-addled 300-pound Samoan attorneys mescaline visions of apocalypse and Johnny Depp channeling the spirit of Raoul Duke. Writer-director Bruce Robinson therefore takes it upon himself to toss out most of the books dialogue and at least one major character and more or less start from scratch. Kemp (Depp) is still a down-at-the-heels journalist bingeing his way through the post-Batista Caribbean but his running mates are more familiarly crazed.The papers photographer Sala (a very enjoyable Michael Rispoli) is now a teddy bear reprobate who joins Kemp on an acid trip thats the movies visual highlight and the character of Moberg a depraved newspaperman whom Giovanni Ribisi renders as a sort of expatriate Renfrew from the ""Dracula movies now listens to Nazi speeches and belches fireballs of 400-proof rum.This is fodder for the frat boys and the plot structure Robinson has laid on top of the frivolity is awfully conventional. Kemp falls in with a slick entrepreneur named Sanderson (an underused Aaron Eckhart) with a hotel deal in the works; what the hero really wants a crack at is Sandersons girlfriend a beautiful sybarite played by Amber Heard.Robinson made a delightfully bent 1987 comedy called ""Withnail amp; I and quickly floundered (""How to Get Ahead in Advertising ""Jennifer 8); ""The Rum Diary is his return to directing after 19 years in the wilderness. The movie is solid twisted fun for about two-thirds of its 120 minutes until you realize that its not going anywhere and that the script consists almost wholly of forced gonzo-isms (""Your tongue is like an accusatory giblet) and pointed but obvious observations about ugly Americans in paradise.Robinson also feels he has to shoehorn Thompsons longstanding hatred of Richard M. Nixon into the mix and ""The Rum Diary ultimately becomes an ordinary coming-of-age saga in which Kemp rouses himself from hedonism and dedicates himself to Doing the Right Thing (while also Getting the Girl) just in time for the late 1960s.Depp whose portrayal of Raoul Duke in the 1998 film version of ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is rightly and wrongly encrusted in legend takes it upon himself to play the artist as a young sot a challenge for an actor pushing 50. Hes believably withdrawn in the early scenes and entertainingly bonkers in the mid-section - its when Kemp is lit up with renewed purpose that the performance feels phony. ""The Rum Diary works itself into a pitch of hero worship that sends Kemp off to fight the good fight against ""the bastards ignoring the fact that in Thompsons bleak view ""the bastards almost always won.In short the movie version of ""The Rum Diary is more interested in idealism than entropy. Im not sure what the late Thompsons response would have been but Im guessing it might involve a shotgun.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. Follow him on Twitter tyburr.

Thompson-insprired film in Rum Jungle. Dont expect Captain Jack Sparrow to show up in this one. Shari L. Gross Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""The Rum Diary"" based on Hunter S. Thompsons semiautobiographical novel gives Johnny Depp the opportunity to play another type of Caribbean drunk. If this makes you anticipate a rollicking farce take a moment and reset your expectations. Set in Puerto Rico in 1960 its the story of a young mans journey physically and spiritually into very unfamiliar terrain. Paul Kemp (Depp) takes a job at the failing English-language San Juan Star newspaper as a stopover on his way to becoming a novelist. The story takes Paul through situations that are in turn dramatic romantic comical violent -- and above all uneven. Paul is the pre-political pre-hallucinogens Thompson an unformed writer who finds himself while exploring the extreme southern frontier of America. This is Depps second whack at the character. He offered an idiosyncratic impersonation of burned-out late-career Thompson in Terry Gilliams psychedelic ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" (Depp also narrated Alex Gibneys documentary ""Gonzo""). The films are entirely unalike but share a common problem. Thompson a thrill-ride writer makes a prosaic leading man. Dialing back the decades Depp now 48 does a convincing job as a naive newbie journalist. The character is closer to ""The Great Gatsbys"" Nick Carraway than Capt. Jack Sparrow. Stranded on an island that is beautiful cruel and chaotic Paul has his eyes opened to injustices more easily ignored on the mainland. The newcomer catches the attention of shrewd operator Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart) who recruits him to publicize a shady development deal. Paul is drawn to Sandersons opulent lifestyle (yachts sports cars even a bejeweled tortoise) and eye-candy mistress (Amber Heard). Hes even more repelled by Sandersons racism and greed The swaggering entrepreneur threatens to shoot poor islanders who venture too close to his private beach. Paul is transformed from thoughtless alcoholic to irate muckraker. But his paper wont print his exposes. The cynical editor (Richard Jenkins) fears upsetting the ""vividly average"" readership and confines Paul to writing puff about tourist attractions. Whats a muckraker to do? Peter Mountain / AP Film District Johnny Depp left and Aaron Eckhart in ""The Rum Diary."" Kemp drifts from one misadventure to the next with no clear purpose and so does the film. Writer/director Bruce Robinson who created the sublime alcoholism tragicomedy ""Withnail amp; I"" and wrote the screenplay for ""The Killing Fields"" captures vivid contrasts between the islands lush scenery and grinding poverty. Theres a gallery of flavorful supporting characters including Giovanni Ribisi as a drug-ravaged ex-writer who foreshadows Thompsons final years. Whats missing is a sense of dramatic urgency. The film is a colorful travelogue unsure of where its going.

You know how and why your favorite caped crusader came to acquire special powers and purpose in life. Slideshow The Rum Diary Premiere Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon More about The Rum Diary >> But the superhero here is in fact a superfreak - Hunter S. Thompson the gonzo journalist of legendary excess (drugs drink women weaponry) whose incendiary mix of fact and fiction upended reportorial writing in the 1970s and 80s. His two best-known works Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail signaled a head-spinning shifting of the gears in the way news could be covered and consumed. Thompson went on to write more (and arguably some say less) but his impact on several generations of writers and readers should not be discounted. One of those readers - later to become Thompsons fast friend - is Johnny Depp who portrayed the authors alter ego Raoul Duke in Terry Gilliams hallucinogenic Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. In The Rum Diary Depp stars again as Thompson - or in this case as Paul Kemp a newspaper reporter who talks his way into a job with a floundering Puerto Rican daily proceeds to consume vast quantities of alcohol gets enmeshed in a shady real estate deal and beds the beauteous girlfriend of the guy whos given him a decidedly interest-conflicting job. The film is from Thompsons semi-autobiographical second novel finished in the early 1960s but not published until almost 40 years later. (Thompson died in 2005; Depp paid for the memorial service.) It is 1960 when Kemp deplanes in Puerto Rico from New York assuring his new editor at the San Juan Star (a very good Richard Jenkins) that he drinks only ""at the upper end of social"" and that he is in fact a responsible reliable deadline-cognizant reporter. The editor Lotterman (based on Thompsons real-life boss back then and there - the novelist William J. Kennedy) sees Kemp for the drunkard that he is. He assigns him a desk and a typewriter and the horoscopes beat. Jazzy and colorful full of men and women in swell clothes driving cool cars The Rum Diary has a bit of a seedily exotic Graham Greene vibe and Robinson moves things along at a nice casual clip even in the films more overheated moments. And overheated moments there are Amber Heard looking dangerously young and impossibly glamorous plays Chenault the blond trophy at the side of the slick sinister Sanderson. Aaron Eckhart puffing expensive cigars is this wheeler-dealer with a beachside manse a yacht a red Austin Healey and Heard. Kemp takes one look at Sandersons girlfriend and mutters ""Oh God why did she have to happen?"" Things dont end well for either Chenault or Kemp but they share some memorable moments as all hell breaks loose. Plot-wise The Rum Diary doesnt quite hang together and the dependably annoying Giovanni Ribisi playing a nutball narcotics fiend by the name of Moburg delivers line readings that bring Peter Lorre and Ratso Rizzo to mind. (Not in a good way.) Michael Rispoli makes a more suitable sidekick for Kemp - his Sala is a seasoned staff photographer who knows where the cheap bars are. A romanticized take on old-time newspapering on waning-days Caribbean colonialism and on the poetry of the besotted scribe The Rum Diary isnt high art. But in its depiction of a budding artist who got himself very high it excels. Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

"Rum Diary The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; rum-diary-the ) Rum Diary The (United States 2011) October 27 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli There are times when the story behind the making of a film is more interesting than the finished product. This is one of those occasions. The Rum Diary was written by Hunter S. Thompson in the 1960s but was not published until 1998 after actor Johnny Depp who had befriended Thompson while prepping for Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas urged the Gonzo journalist to make it public. Depp has been connected to potential film versions for more than ten years. Two failed attempts (one which was to have starred Depp and the other which was to have featured Benicio Del Toro) preceded the one that made it in front of the cameras. Depps hand-picked director for this take was Bruce Robinson (who hasnt made anything since 1992s Jennifer Eight) whose own problems with alcohol may have rivaled those of Thompson. Seemingly against all odds filming wrapped but finding a distributor became an issue even with Depp starring. FilmDistrict a relatively new player in the movie game picked it up but its difficult to determine who the audience is expected to be. Does Thompson still have enough devotees decades after being at his pinnacle and six years after his suicide to prevent The Rum Diary from becoming a cash sinkhole? Theres a lot wrong with The Rum Diary and not a lot right. Most of the problems relate to the source material and the fuzzy hazy nature of the narrative. From a cinematic perspective its an impressive production with an evocative re-creation of 1960 Puerto Rico. Depp is suave and charismatic (although theres a little too much Captain Jack Sparrow without the grunge in the portrayal). Aaron Eckhart one of the few working actors who can convincingly wear a white hat or a black one is in full asshole mode. And Amber Heard is as sexy as a woman can be especially during a nightclub dance. The Rum Diary fails because of the screenplay and the screenplay stumbles because it shows too much reverence to its source material. One positive quality ascribable to the movie is that its more coherent than Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas although it is also more conventional. The Rum Diary fails to offer a full helping of anything. The contrived romance is half-presented. The comedy is hit-and-miss. The main characters arc which transforms him from a drunken libertarian to a crusader for the undertrodden is half-described. The conflict between the protagonist and antagonist is left unresolved. In fact the entire story has an unfinished half-baked sensibility. An attempt to provide a sense of closure via an end-of-the-movie caption is unsatisfying. Its nice to know that everything turns out okay but wouldnt it have been better to show it if only in a montage? Depp plays journalist Paul Kemp loosely based on Thompson (or at least Thompson as he saw himself) who applies for a job at the San Juan Star and gets it because hes the only applicant. When asked about his sobriety by his new editor Lotterman (Richard Jenkins) he claims to be operating at the high end of the social drinking scale despite wearing sunglasses to conceal a hangover. While working at the Star Paul befriends photographer Sala (Michael Rispoli) who makes cash on the side by fighting cocks and ex-journalist Moburg (Giovanni Ribisi) whose mind has been fried by too much booze and drugs. His writing skills are sought after by land developer Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart) who wants Paul to scribe favorable stories in the paper about a deal hes putting together. Paul is seduced by Sandersons genial demeanor and free handouts but its his mistress Chenault (Amber Heard) who makes the prospect of getting into Sandersons inner circle enticing. Unfortunately once there Paul learns what kind of man hes dealing with. One can respect Depps loyalty to his dead friends legacy to get this movie on the screen and to lend his not inconsiderable talents to the proceedings but the result is unremarkable. The Rum Diary is presented as if through an alcoholic haze with plot strands spreading without root or direction. Even as a character study of Paul and an exploration of how he finds his ""voice"" as a writer and sets out to defend the common man against ""The Bastards"" The Rum Diary lacks cohesiveness and conviction. Pauls transformation is not credible; it happens as if by magic. And at two hours the film overstays its welcome. Nothing and no one in The Rum Diary is compelling or endearing enough to make us want to stick with it for that long. According to reports director Robinson fell off the wagon while making the movie (although returned to sobriety after it was finished). Such a sacrifice deserves a better end product. This one is just a pretty-looking mess.

Thompson; Release Date Wide 10/28/2011; Runtime (in minutes) 120; MPAA Rating R; Distributor FilmDistrict Posted November 30 2011 -- 1200 AM EST The Rum Diary marks the second time that Johnny Depp has played the proudly dissolute candle-burning-at-both-ends gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson -- or at least a thinly fictionalized version of him. Its easy to see whats lured him back to the role. Thompson was a lifelong student of bad behavior -- its there in the subjects he was drawn to (the Hells Angels Richard Nixon) and in his drug-addled often violent antics -- but he was also a born agitator a messed-up rebel-addict with a cause. That makes him the perfect saintly sinner to be played by a Hollywood superstar who still wants to think of himself as a bad boy. Based on an old autobiographical novel that Thompson pulled out of his drawer and published in 1998 The Rum Diary sets us down in the lush urban tropical backwater of San Juan Puerto Rico in 1960 where Depps Paul Kemp -- basically Thompson with a different name -- arrives to work for a grimy little newspaper geared to American tourists. This isnt the bald deranged LSD-popping Thompson figure with a cigarette holder jammed in his jaws whom Depp embodied in the unwatchable Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998). Its Thompson the inexperienced young dandy still feeling his (wild) oats. The characterization though remains more or less the same. Depp stares off into space as if his brain were being slowly eaten by worms and he speaks in a robo-monotone. You could call his acting ""cool"" but a more apt description would be monochromatic and hollow. Kemp is an acrid shell of a man fueled by voluminous amounts of alcohol and though the film pre-?sents him as an adventurer in a way he lacks adventure He has nothing of interest to say. The director Bruce Robinson made the end-of-the-60s cult film Withnail amp; I (1987) but that film was about a fascinating rotter. Depps Kemp is just a hipster blank. He declares war on his shouting hack of an editor (Richard Jenkins) and falls in with a fellow journalist (Michael Rispoli) who becomes ? his drinking buddy and sidekick the two of them -- like everyone else on the island -- oiled by rum. He also meets the most powerful Americans on hand like Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart) a businessman involved in shady development deals and Sandersons girlfriend a WASP fatale played by Amber Heard in bedazzling cosmetics Shes all cocoa skin and Grace Kelly lipstick like a 50s magazine cover come to life. Sanderson plans to turn beach property into tourist resorts and the film treats his cutting of legal corners as a deathless scandal one that leads to Kemps discovery of the evils of capitalism the world of ""bastards."" But to the audience this stuff seems like awfully old news. Were supposed to be witnessing the birth of a great journalist but Hunter S. Thompson as his career went on got swallowed up by his mystique as an outlaw of excess. In The Rum Diary that myth becomes an excuse for a movie to go slumming.

The Rum Diary (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Rum Diary (R) Johnny Depp shines in this tale of an unhinged journalist running loose in 1960s Puerto Rico. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle The Miami Herald10/27/2011 Editor rating 3 Back in the glamorous days of journalism potential employers were more interested in the depth of your relationship with alcohol than your social-media savvy smoking was permitted in the office and the notion that honest stories could change the world still prevailed at least among a certain set of starry-eyed writers. Thats the gospel according to The Rum Diary a big rambling entertaining love letter to the late Hunter S. Thompson based on his loosely autobiographical novel. Thompson was 22 when he wrote The Rum Diary and hadnt quite mastered the hallucinatory style that made him famous in such books as Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. But then the 1960s hadnt happened yet and the 60s were what made Thompson the anti-authoritarian zeitgeist allowing his distinctive prose to flourish. The Rum Diary takes that premise and runs with it. Set in 1960 in an idyllic (at first) Puerto Rico the film follows the adventures of reporter Paul Kemp (Johnny Depp) who starts out writing horoscopes for the San Juan paper then winds up entangled by a powerful and unscrupulous PR machine named Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart). Sanderson wants Kemp to take on some extracurricular writing touting his business interests. Kemp likes the idea of getting paid more almost as much as he likes Sandersons girlfriend Chenault (Amber Heard). But he finds himself torn between the wealthy businessman who is slapping up hotels along every inch of Puerto Rican sand and the local residents who can barely see the ocean anymore (though his encounters with those residents are not always sympathetic -- or sane). The push-pull of commerce and poverty the newspapers demand for fluff pieces and Kemps growing lust for Chenault wear on his patience and sanity as does the fact hes a highly functioning alcoholic. Helping Kemp enter a spiral of booze-fueled anarchy is his photographer pal/roommate Sala (the hilarious Michael Rispoli one of the best things in the movie) and the deranged Moberg (Giovanni Ribisi) a former reporter whose brain has been ravaged by drinking what he assures Kemp is 470 proof rum. The demon rum is practically a character and the gorgeously shot film looks so good it makes drunken binges and soul-crushing hangovers appealing. Theres something refreshing about The Rum Diarys rejection of political correctness. There are no women aside from Chenault who exists solely to inject sex appeal into the proceedings. The characters drink bet on cockfights and ingest mysterious hallucinogens that aid Kemp at least in finding his true voice. In other words the whole movie is one big beautiful funny nostalgic blast and a fine fitting tribute to a writer who relished skewering sacred cows. Cast Johnny Depp Michael Rispoli Giovanni Ribisi Aaron Eckhart Amber Heard Richard Jenkins. Writer-director Bruce Robinson. Based on the book by Hunter S. Thompson.

Comments click to enlarge The Rum Diary Rated R  120 minutes  2011 More than a decade after Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998) Johnny Depp takes another stab at playing his old pal Hunter S. Thompson--aka ""Paul Kemp""--in this screen adaptation of the writers early autobiographical novel. The book recounted Thompsons escapades as a young reporter in San Juan in the early 60s though it wasnt published until the late 90s when the writers work had grown so tired that even his juvenilia began to look good. ""Ive got no voice"" the hero admits in the movie. ""I dont know how to write like me."" Therein lies the problem despite some scattered moments of bad craziness involving the hero and his drinking buddies (Michael Rispoli Giovanni Ribisi) the spine of the story is no strange and terrible saga but a conventional morality tale in which the Thompson character gets mixed up with an American real estate barracuda (Aaron Eckhart) and his luscious girlfriend (Amber Heard). Bruce Robinson (Withnail amp; I) directed his own screenplay; with Richard Jenkins. By J.R.

"Rum Diary movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Rum Diary offers postcards from a lost friendDepp imbues Thompsons tale with a hint of Captain Jack -- 2 1/2 starsOctober 27 2011|Michael Phillips | Movie criticJohnny Depp was a pal of the late Hunter S. Thompsons and the frustrating but thickly atmospheric film version of Thompsons early novel ""The Rum Diary"" finds Depp and writer-director Bruce Robinson paying tribute to the author freelance gonzo journalist career substance-ingester and lifelong alcohol sponge.The undertaking was a labor of love. The results are more a labor of ""like in parts"" but they certainly dont resemble anything else on screen at the moment.Thompson wrote ""The Rum Diary"" in 1959. For a brief spell he resided in Puerto Rico living hard and fast in Bacardiville writing for a rag called ""El Sportivo"" and attempting and failing to find work at the English-language San Juan Star.Out of these facts came Thompsons wish-fulfillment novel in which the autobiographical figure Paul Kemp is a Star reporter who falls in with the lover of a ruthless American developer.Robinson streamlines the character roster so that Kemps adventures provide the through-line led by his Don Quixote/Sancho Panza routine with his confidant and conscience the photojournalist Sala (Michael Rispoli). The writer-director of ""The Rum Diary"" is best known for the worst-vacation-ever classic ""Withnail amp; I"" which is practically a religion in England and has its ardent fans (including me) here in America. Robinson has directed only three films since then the last ""unmentionable"" one (Robinsons own description) being ""Jennifer 8"" nearly 20 years ago.At its best the fractious ""Withnail"" magic resurfaces in the sunnier climes of ""The Rum Diary."" Shot on location in Puerto Rico the film scampers after Depps reporter (Richard Jenkins in the worlds finest lousy toupee plays his editor) as he tests his ethics against those of the developer played by Aaron Eckhart and the developers thrill-seeking mistress played by Amber Heard.There isnt a sophisticated or ""adult"" perspective to be found in ""The Rum Diary."" Though made by seasoned pros it derives from a novel written by Hunter when he was a veteran hellion of 22. Depp brings everything he can to the role except the raw-youth part. (If only hed made it around the time he made the film version of ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"")Its evident Depp shot ""The Rum Diary"" in the wake of his ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" juggernaut -- some of the double takes he owes to Jack Sparrow and no one else. Its equally evident Depps amusement and engagement with scoundrels and rakes of all types can anchor even a wobbly film.The best thing that can come out of ""The Rum Diary""?

Thompson At Rum Diary Event The Huffington Post Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture ""I tend to avoid alcohol when I can"" says Kemp (Johnny Depp) a reporter who has just joined an English-language newspaper in San Juan Puerto Rico. Actually he tends to avoid not drinking. Calibrating his liquor consumption as ""at the upper end of social"" Kemp hitches an occasional ride on the wagon then gets off and brags ""I finally beat my will power."" When he goes on a toot at a bowling alley the tenpins morph into rum bottles. San Juan in 1960 when Kemp arrives is a territory pining for statehood (which Hawaii and Alaska had just achieved) and shivering at the recent Communist takeover of Cuba 1100 miles across the Caribbean. But the locals dont figure nearly as importantly in Kemps adventures as booze does. The movie is after all called The Rum Diary. The trajectory of Johnny Depps career could be both an inspiration and a cautionary tale for Hollywood rebels. The young Depp was as wayward as he was beautiful. Graduating early from entertainments mean Streets (TVs 21 Jump Wes Cravens first Nightmare on Elm) he flew in early manhood toward the weird and the serious. Count the ways after a bit in Platoon Depp starred as the greaser in John Waters Cry-Baby the fish-tagger in Serbian director Emir Kusturicas Arizona Dream the Buster Keaton wannabe in Benny amp; Joon Leonard DiCaprios protective brother in Whats Eating Gilbert Grape the shear-fingered or blithely demented Eds of Tim Burton (Scissorhands Wood) the hapless bookkeeper in Jim Jarmuschs black-and-white ""acid Western"" Dead Men the gypsy horsemen in Sally Potters The Man Who Cried and cocaine king George Jung in Blow. In 1997 Depp directed himself and Marlon Brando in The Brave a gorgeous suicidally obscure modern-day Western sadly unavailable on Region 1 DVD. He capstoned his Weird Phase by playing Hunter Thompsons alter ego (and libido) Raoul Duke in Terry Gilliams 1998 film of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. All in all an imposing resume boasting its fair share of daring. Around this time Depp settled down in France with actress Vanessa Paradis and raised their two children. Since then hes made movies mostly for his kids the four Pirates of the Caribbean megahits Finding Neverland Alice in Wonderland Rango. Nothing against some of these films but they denied Depp his lingering musk of danger. Over this same span George Clooney another dreamboat star fronted grownup movies the kind hed like to see. All right Clooney is a serial bachelor with no responsibility to amuse his spawn on screen as well as at home. But Brad Pitt who like Depp lives with a famous actress and has some kids took career risks with Babel Burn After Reading The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford and The Tree of Life. Depp needed some offbeat project if only so he could radiate something besides mad or weary brio in G or PG-rated pre-tween fare. He found his respite from Jack Sparrow in an early novel by his old pal Thompson who died in 2005. (Depp arranged the cannon that shot Thompsons ashes into the Pacific.) The actor bought the rights and convinced a character nearly as eccentric as Thompson to adapt and direct it. The Englishman Bruce Robinson began as an actor (Benvolio in Franco Zeffirellis 1968 Romeo and Juliet the dashing Lieutenant Isabelle Adjani is mad for in Francois Truffauts 1975 The Story of Adele H) then a decade later put part of his own life on film with Withnail amp; I a memoir of himself and a sublimely inebriated flatmate played to haughty-pathetic perfection by Richard E. Grant. Over the years Withnail has been deeply cherished--Depply cherished too. The star saw an Alcoholics Enormous kinship in Robinson and Thompson and produced The Rum Diary with Robinson directing in Puerto Rico in early 2009. Nearly three years later here it is. (MORE See Withnail and I in the Top 10 Sloppiest Movie Drunks) ""Puerto Rico was a backwater and the Daily News was staffed mainly by ill-tempered wandering rabble"" Thompson writes in an essay accompanying the book. ""In a sense I was one of them -- more competent than some and more stable than others -- and in the years that I carried that ragged banner I was seldom unemployed ... I wrote ad copy for new casinos and bowling alleys. I was a consultant for the cockfighting syndicate an utterly corrupt high-end restaurant critic a yachting photographer and a routine victim of police brutality. It was a greedy life and I was good at it. I made some interesting friends had enough money to get around and learned a lot about the world that I could never have learned in any other way."" Thompson poured his life into his novel. Kemps first assignment is covering the bowling scene; he is offered a job writing copy for hotel-casinos about to be built on an island abandoned by the U.S. military; his friend Sala (Michael Rispoli) makes side money sometimes big money in cockfights; he hitches a ride on a rich Americans yacht; he earns the suspicions of local toughs and the police. Kemps temptations include promised millions in a scam dreamed up the American ex-journalist Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart) -- a modern pirate of the Caribbean who calls the island ""Gods idea of money"" and has a racist aversion of ""the overtanned locals"" -- as well as the blond warmth of Sandersons mistress Chenault (Amber Heard). The Rum Diary and Withnail amp; I have this in common theyre louche -- a word I have to look up every time I think of using it but which means appealingly disreputable. Thompsons plot suggests a Grahame Greene novel of comic espionage like Our Man in Havana transferred to San Juan and given a Mickey Finn. Proudly sodden and sleepy-eyed the movie plays like a drunken night with the guys as seen by the one teetotaler; it displays the amiability of an alcoholic haze without conveying it. Robinson is sharper with the scene of Kemp and Sala trying some LSD-type wonder drug. (Kemp stares at his friend notices something odd protruding from his mouth and says ""Your tongue--its like an exploratory gibbet."") They got the drug from Moburg (Giovanni Ribisi) their severely delusional colleague at the paper whos prone to observations like ""Did you see the side of his neck? Blackheads like Braille."" Set in 1960 The Rum Diary has the grainy look and grungy feel of a 70s dark comedy like Wheres Poppa? or Little Murders -- movies that pursued misanthropic satire and didnt care if anybody got it. This sense of a film thats one decade off is reinforced by the characters use of words (vibe Jacuzzi condo) that didnt enter common usage until the end of the 60s. Its pleasant to spend time back in the day whatever the year and to slip into the skin of a movie perfectly content to let its audience observe behavior without having to accept it. Maybe too content. Sanderson says that ""Some days are two sizes too small""; the movie is too defiantly tiny an agreeable time-waster for the onlookers and its star. The Rum Diary isnt a corrective to Johnny Depps kid-centric career more like a vacation from it in a resort where the visitors are strange the natives are restless and the flow of alcohol endless.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The demented genius of Terry Gilliams adaptation of Hunter S. Thompsons Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas lay in Gilliams ability to find a stylistic analog to Thompsons acid-soaked misadventures in the desert. The visual overload grows nearly intolerable but the endless bingeing sessions and surreal psychedelics give the hungover moments of clarity and insight that much more pop. By contrast Bruce Robinsons The Rum Diary based on Thompsons semi-autobiographical novel about his time in Puerto Rico in the early 60s feels loose but lackadaisical--a shaggy-dog story thats mostly shag and little dog. Fear And Loathing star Johnny Depp more or less reprises his role as Thompsons alter ego once again playing a journalist whose yen for excess obscures the idealism at his core. But the film despite its obvious intelligence and flashes of wit doesnt bring that passion across. The Rum Diary opens with Depp stumbling a day late into the offices of the San Juan Star a two-bit newspaper hampered by striking union workers and an editor-in-chief with no apparent love for the profession (the always-indispensible Richard Jenkins). Depp hacks out horoscopes and other space-fillers and drinks heavily in the long hours in between befriending a photographer (Michael Rispoli) whos even more self-destructive than he is. Meanwhile Depp gets roped into the lavish world of an American entrepreneur (Aaron Eckhart) who seeks to exploit the islands pristine beaches for a luxury resort staffed by underpaid locals. Depps interest in the businessmans hot young girlfriend (Amber Heard) temporarily distracts him from the nefarious scheming going on under his nose. Writer-director Bruce Robinson seems like the perfect man for the job having familiarized himself with drink both on-screen with the cult favorite Withnail And I and off where hes had his own struggles with alcoholism. (Hes talked publicly about falling off the wagon during Diarys production.) And Robinson does bring the film some depth and soul particularly in the push-and-pull between his heros allegiances to indulgence and to justice. But too much of The Rum Diary is not just aimless but rudderless so hip to its own Caribbean vibe that it feels detached and underinvested especially in a romantic subplot that goes nowhere. The burning embers in Thompsons soul are reduced here to a faint flicker.

Thompson in ""The Rum Diary"" based on Thompsons first novel -- the manuscript for which Depp found in the writers home. The Rum Diary Good Director Bruce Robinson. Cast Johnny Depp Michael Rispoli Aaron Eckhart. Rating R for language brief drug use and sexuality. >> Interview Johnny Depp on Rum Diary Thompson But if youre looking for the gonzo ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" version of Thompson -- Depp played him in the film version of that too -- you wont find it here (except in a relatively subdued LSD-experimentation scene). Instead you get a look at a fictionalized version of Thompson before that came to pass a writer tormented by his inability to find his voice who is learning to deal in his own way with the corruption of Puerto Rico and eventually everything else he comes across. You also get drinking. Lots and lots of drinking. By the time the movie is half over youll feel hungover. Focus through the haze though and youll see an imperfect portrait of what so often is overlooked when it comes to Thompson his writing and his obsessive dedication to it. When we meet Paul Kemp (Depp) hes lying in a trashed hotel room in Puerto Rico with a wicked hangover and a job interview approaching. Kemp wants to be a reporter for the San Juan Star a threadbare newspaper whose obvious decline inadvertently mirrors the struggles that besiege the industry today. Lotterman (Richard Jenkins) the harried editor hires Kemp despite his obviously inflated resume and lies about his drinking which Kemp describes with a straight face as ""the upper end of social."" Its easy for Lotterman to spot a drinker though because everyone here is a drinker day and night. Kemp is sent off with Sala (Michael Rispoli) a staff photographer who has been on the island long enough to know how things work (and how they dont). They end up rooming together in a pit of an apartment which occasionally is shared with Moburg (Giovanni Ribisi) a reporter who never works and is about as far gone to seed as is possible without rigor mortis setting in. An odd fellow he listens to records of Hitler speeches for fun and strains fluid through stolen hotel air-conditioner filters to make some sort of souped-up brain-cell-destroying liquor. Kemp goes along to get along falling into gringos-vs.-locals adventures with Sala but hes also being courted by Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart) a rich American businessman with plans for a beautiful undeveloped island nearby (which the U.S. military is using for target practice). Its all perfectly nefarious something Kemp spots quickly but hes intrigued by the money and more important by Sandersons stunning girlfriend Chenault (Amber Heard). The corruption eventually gets to Kemp and the first stirrings of a gonzo existence creep in -- not just with the acid trip but with a rant against Richard Nixon whose fall rise and fall would become an obsession for the real-life Thompson. Thompson hadnt finished ""The Rum Diary"" when Depp found it and at times it seems as if Bruce Robinson who wrote the screenplay and directs hasnt completed the job either. The adventures mostly lead to nothing as does the intrigue. But a subdued Depp is good and Rispoli even better. (Ribisi is outstanding but more as a curiosity than a real character.) ""The Rum Diary"" isnt for everyone but fans of Thompson will find enjoyment in the relative booze-soaked calm before the psychedelic storm. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Hoberman The Ghost of Hunter Thompson A Tame Rum Diary Wednesday October 26 2011 at 4 a.m. By J. Hoberman 1 A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Written and directed by Bruce Robinson The Rum Diary is what the Brits might call a rum movie--an oddly inoffensive piece and a personal project for its disconcertingly unengaged star Johnny Depp.The movie adapts a novel Hunter S. Thompson began in the early 60s and published under Depps auspices more than three decades later. A first-person account of the drinking life on a tropical isle in the late 1950s its protagonists are mainly employees of an undercapitalized English-language daily in San Juan; their perpetually soused attitude is less Beat than Lost Generation though written (or rewritten) with a heedless hedonism that anticipates the addled excesses of the high 60s.As the writer-director of the 1987 comedy Withnail and I (a fondly remembered cult film in which a drug-befuddled pair of upper-class degenerates stagger through Swinging Londons twilight debris) Robinson would seem uniquely suited to handle the triumphalist disorder of the Thompson worldview. Unfortunately just as The Rum Diary was conceived too early in Thompsons career for maximum oomph Robinsons long-germinating and for several years shelved adaptation arrives too late in the career of the filmmaker and his star--the bacchanal is weirdly elegiac as though once meant to be a New Hollywood vehicle for the young Elliott Gould.The party gets under way with Thompsons alter ego Kemp (played by Thompsons other alter ego Depp) coming to consciousness having raped the minibar in a dark trashed hotel room overlooking a glorious beach--his bleary disorientation accentuated by the small plane that flies by with the unfurled banner ""Puerto Rico Welcomes Union Carbide."" Pave paradise--put up a parking lot Ugly Americans infest the bowling alley; right-wing capitalists plan vulgar resorts on the unspoiled army testing range at Vieques. Newly arrived from New York Kemp finds an ongoing never-exactly-explained riot outside the offices of the San Juan Star and a lunatic editor within (Richard Jenkins). Soon his lowlife colleagues the garrulous frustrated news photographer Sala (Michael Rispoli) and brain-damaged crime writer Moburg (Giovanni Ribisi) initiate him into a round of bar-hopping and cockfighting that results in an epic trip to the slammer. Still The Rum Diary could use a shot of the mania that fueled Terry Gilliams Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. As deadpan as he is Depp could use a crazed Benicio Del Toro to complement his cool.Although nearby Cuba newly liberated from the imperialist yoke is the movies great unmentioned Robinson adds a dash of politics to the cocktail. Kemp is a would-be journalistic muckraker who sullenly contemplates Vice President Richard Nixon on TV. ""How long can the blizzard of insult continue?"" he demands in gonzo wonderment. Turns out to be long enough for Kemp to be recruited to write a smarmy promotional brochure by smooth American ex-journalist Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart) shacked up with the captivating Connecticut wild child Chenault (Amber Heard). ""This place is a sea of money"" is Sandersons siren song but Chenault who charmingly goads Kemp into driving his shiny new Corvette off a dock is the siren.As in Thompsons readable but hardly revelatory novel the narrative reaches its climax at Carnival on St. Thomas with Kemp fallen off the wagon and Chenault casting her spell on a juke joint of drunken mob revelry. Unfortunately the movie soldiers on. Like an emissary from the future Moburg shows up with an unnamed super-drug that administered as eyedrops gets Sala and Kemp stoned and wildly hallucinating. As though watching an outtake from Fear and Loathing Kemp sees Sala flexing a fearsome facial appendage ""Your tongue is like an accusatory giblet"" Less convincing are Kemps resolution to become an honest reporter--never mind that the Star seems to be on the verge of folding--and the fake happy ending that provides a cheerful precis of Kemp and Chenaults subsequent life back in the states.The Rum Diary has plenty of insolent patter and pungent background clutter; Robinson is good on sweaty sodden mise-en-scene and elaborately grubby tropical torpor but he never quite gets the giddy velocity of a what-the-fuck bender. Truth to tell The Rum Diary is actually more of a light morning-after hangover--it wont leave you with a headache. Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact J.

E-mail| Print| Text size - + If Batman and the X-Men get prequels why not Hunter S. Thompson?He was certainly a superhero of a kind just one whose powers mainly consisted of consuming copious amounts of alcohol while still somehow churning out wildly colorful raging dispatches from the road.""The Rum Diary"" is based on Thompsons heavily autobiographical novel by the same name which he wrote as a 22-year-old in the early 1960s after a stint as a newspaper reporter in San Juan Puerto Rico. It wasnt published until 1998. Since then Thompsons friend Johnny Depp (who also played Thompson in 1998s ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"") has been trying to adapt ""The Rum Diary"" to the screen.""The Rum Diary"" -- which is dedicated to Thompson who died in 2005 -- is essentially a portrait of the Duke as a young journalist. The stand-in for Thompson the young novelist-reporter Paul Kemp (Depp) is trying to find his way and his writing voice Its the birth of Gonzo.Criminally exaggerated resume in hand Kemp has gone to Puerto Rico to try his hand as a reporter. He lands a job at the San Juan Star whose editor-in-chief Lotterman (the excellent Richard Jenkins) is at his wits end running a failing diminishing daily. As he interviews a hung-over Kemp he quizzes him on what kind of drinker he is to which Kemp deadpans that hes at ""the upper-end of social.""Kemp is befriended by staff photographer Sala (Michael Rispoli in a deservedly big part for him) a burly genial newsman who is nevertheless not once seen with a camera in hand. Kemp moves into Salas dilapidated dump of an apartment which he shares with crime reporter Moberg (Giovanni Ribisi) a horse-voiced over-drugged oddity who listens to Hitler broadcasts and sets some kind of record for caustic reporter-editor relations.Kemp catches the attention of American businessman Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart) a smooth manipulator who is trying to push through an enormous development of a nearby pristine island thats pushing locals out in favor of American investors. Sanderson recruits Kemp to spin the development favorably in the Star.This picture of American corruption of Puerto Rico is one of the more compelling aspects of ""The Rum Diary."" A combative atmosphere between poor locals and rich Americans hangs in the air as do the Navy bombing tests on Vieques. Depp is again in the Caribbean among pirates.Sandersons slick wealthy appeal is tempting to Kemp who isnt finding the constricting Star to be an especially noble pursuit either. Even more alluring is Sandersons beautiful fiancee Chenault played by Amber Heard. Kemp immediately falls for her (""Oh God why did she have to happen?"" he mutters after meeting her) and its no wonder Heard is a stunning presence.This builds slowly for Kemp into a moral crisis and finally an artistic tipping-point. ""I dont know how to write like me"" he says but by the end of the film its clear that Kemp/Thompson has found his legs. The guiding principle is a furious distrust of authority (we glimpse him cursing Nixon) and a key ingredient is hallucinogens (we also get an early encounter with LSD).You might expect a tribute such as this to be sycophantic but director Bruce Robinson (famous for the brilliant cult film ""Withnail amp; I"") keeps a realistic tone. Robinson who also wrote the screenplay adaptation doesnt present the cartoonish Thompson weve come to expect. Its a refreshing grounded view of the writer.Depp at this point would seem to not be aging. This more low-key performance as a Thompson alter-ego feels truer than the manic derangement of ""Fear and Loathing"" but the role is also lacking yearning and real energy.Thompson went on to find his voice but ""The Rum Diary"" entertaining and well-intended comes just shy of discovering its own.""The Rum Diary"" a FilmDistrict release is rated R for language brief drug use and sexuality.

Thompson is Flawed But Earnest HAMPTONS REVIEW | ""Rum Diary"" Johnny Depps Homage to Hunter S. Thompson is Flawed But Earnest Eric Kohn Oct 16 2011 458 am erickohn Share This Article Pin It Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Print Talk ""Vividly average"" is the term used to describe the Puerto Rican readership of a raggedy newspaper in ""The Rum Diary"" Bruce Robinsons adaptation of the early Hunter S. Thompson novel. It could also describe the resulting movie. Depp coaxed Robinson out of retirement to write and direct ""The Rum Diary"" as a tribute to the author and his late friend. The result is a subpar comic adventure thats nonetheless admirable for its restrained vision of Thompson in his early gestation period. Robinson gives the material a light touch that only clicks when its origin story takes shape. While thats not enough to rescue it from general mediocrity the ""Withnail amp; I"" director delivers a peculiarly amusing prequel to the more significant chaos of Thompson in full bloom (memorably embodied by Depp in ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas""). In ""The Rum Diary"" Depp plays a fictionalized version of Thompson without the gonzo bite. That makes the story less excitingly wacky but its ultimately enjoyable for outlining the birth of Thompsons muckraking attitude. American journalist Paul Kemp (Depp) Thompsons alter ego arrives in bustling San Juan during the late 1950s to work for the flailing English language newspaper The Daily News. Hung over on the first day of the job he immediately faces the ire of a jaded editor Lotterman (Richard Jenkins relishing the opportunity to play against type with a role that calls for extreme overstatement). Fully aware that the paper is a sinking ship Lotterman assigns Kemp to innumerable blase stories about the local tourist scene. Disinterested from the start Kemp wanders through the landscape in a drunken haze commiserating with colleagues Sala (Michael Rispoli) and the drug-addled Moburg (Giovanni Ribisi). He eventually meets scheming real estate mogul Sanderson (Aaron Ekchart) and gets suckered into assisting him with a sketchy hotel complex while falling for Sandersons arm candy Chenault (Amber Heard the casts weakest link and a sorely underwritten character). Establishing Kemps world during the messy first hour ""The Rum Diary"" tumbles through a series of flimsy non-events strung together by gorgeous scenery. (This issue plagues the novel as well but Thompsons prose makes it gel.) Depp monotonous as ever and dialing down his Thompson impersonation barely seems present in the role. Over time however hes surrounded by intrigue that glosses over his muted stare. Kemps eventual motivation to take a stand against the corruption of the islands affluent powers and racist oppression of its working class gives ""The Rum Diary"" a deeper meaning in its second half at which point Robinsons screenplay improves its perceptive powers. Kemps transition from careless alcoholic to irreverent avenger takes place with a series of loony moments that hint at the legacy in question. Even the requisite Thompson hallucination quietly comes and goes. Robinson teases the possibility of a major psychedelic sequence when Sala and Kemp take a mysterious drug then concludes the scene with a single amusing hallucination. As the Thompson/Kemp revelations arrive slowly ""The Rum Diary"" effectively ponders the flaws of mainstream media as an agent of change explaining Thompsons need to escape the system and pave his own path. However Robinson doesnt push the material in any inspired direction. ""The Rum Diary"" stumbles through a few enjoyable moments of slapstick (notably in a scene that finds Kemp in Salas lap while escaping police pursuit in a broken vehicle) but it cant find a way to energize its sense of purpose. Thats partly because unlike Thompsons writings ""The Rum Diary"" exists outside his head. It doesnt assume a first-person voice (with the exception of a random fleeting voiceover). Robinson takes a step back from the storys hapless protagonist to observe the evolution of his behavior. Thats both to the movies credit and its chief flaw. Kemps desperate efforts to cobble together a grassroots publishing effort assumes the form of a loopy adventure and yet it never explodes as advertised. The plot fizzles along with the newspaper at its center. However ""The Rum Diary"" still has enough spirit to turn it into a sufficiently entertaining romp in between the lulls. Its not essential Thompson but even Thompson-lite has firm appeal. As the movie approaches a descent into mayhem and then pulls back it remains -- against all odds -- a fairly sober history of journalisms loosest cannon.

Set for a release on October 28 by FilmDistrict ""The Rum Diary"" is bound to attract crowds interested either in Depp or Thompson but a generally underwhelming critical reaction and subdued narrative will likely prevent it from gaining much long-term traction.

""Absolutely nothing in moderation"" states the tagline for ""The Rum Diary"" and Johnny Depp lives up to it by getting sloshed for the better part of two hours. Yet temperance of a different sort a willful abstention from trippy stylistic excess is what makes this 1960-set Caribbean picaresque easily the most lucid screen adaptation of Hunter S. Thompsons work even if its still several drafts shy of a fully developed yarn. Stronger on dreamy seedy atmosphere than on narrative coherence FilmDistricts exotic curio should draw the overlapping Depp/Thompson fanbases but will command general auds in well moderation. Thompson was in his early 20s when he wrote his semi-autobiographical second novel about hard-nosed American newspapermen drinking screwing and occasionally writing amid the social upheaval of late-50s Puerto Rico. The manuscript went unpublished for nearly 40 years before it was finally excavated (with Depps help) and printed in 1998 offering the public a rare dispatch from the authors pre-gonzo years; though recognizably Thompson in its first-person account of lust lucre and liquor ""The Rum Diary"" merely hinted at the heavy drug use and reckless blurring of fact and fiction that would define his style. By dint of its source material then writer-director Bruce Robinsons long-aborning screen version never devolves into a catalog of aggressively stupid acid-trip behavior a la 1998s ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas""; this may disappoint extreme Thompson buffs but will make ""Diary"" that much more palatable for a wider viewership. The chief similarity between the two pics is that both star Depp as a substance-abusing scribe who cant seem to control his vices or stay on assignment in an unfamiliar environment. Its 1960 in San Juan a tropical shark tank where U.S. business interests run rampant the locals harbor bitter anti-American sentiment and the fourth estate occupies the lowest dirtiest rung of the social ladder. Paul Kemp (Depp) has just arrived to work at the San Juan Star run by a cantankerous editor (Richard Jenkins) who takes one look at Kemps bloodshot eyes and warns him to lay off the liquor. Fat chance so long as Kemp is rolling with the colorful likes of world-weary photographer Sala (Michael Rispoli) and wild eccentric Moburg (Giovanni Ribisi) who likes to experiment with narcotics and listen to old recordings of Hitlers speeches. Early passages in particular are notable for their bracingly sharp tangy dialogue much of which is written from scratch; fans of Robinsons all-too-infrequent work (""Withnail and I"" ""Jennifer Eight"") will recognize and relish the literate sensibility at play here. The scribe-helmer also has productively reshuffled and consolidated figures from the book eliminating one major character and handing a prominent role to Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart) a suave well-heeled American businessman who brings Kemp into his inner circle. Hoping to elicit favorable copy about a shady real-estate deal Sanderson dangles a number of gifts before Kemp the most tantalizing being his own g.f. Chenault (Amber Heard recently of NBCs ""The Playboy Club""). An arrestingly foxy vision in white bikini and red lipstick Heard drives two of the pictures most indelible sequences one in which Kemp and Chenault take Sandersons Corvette for a spin and another in which the girl loses herself amid a writhing tangle of bodies on a dance floor. Lurching from these moments of pulse-quickening eroticism to Kemp and Salas unruly misadventures ""The Rum Diary"" executes its tonal backflips with the woozy grace of an amiable drunkard. Mercifully theres only one obligatory scene of psychotropic hallucination and in this fairly restrained context its grotesquerie is almost exquisite. Conjuring a sweaty sordid ambience through d.p. Dariusz Wolskis Super 16 lensing and use of mostly natural light the film as a whole is best appreciated as a succession of richly rendered moods plenty stimulating in the moment but rarely coalescing into something greater. The novel though similarly ragged was held together by Thompsons tough vision of a harsh lawless Puerto Rico succumbing to the Wests parasitic influence; what little of this makes it onscreen has been soft-pedaled its fearsome violence reduced to the level of a hangover. Robinson attempts to elevate Kemps moral stature by molding him into an avatar of stick-it-to-the-Man justice a muckraking pen wielded against societys ""bastards"" according to the films closing dedication to Thompson. But this aim is frustrated surprisingly by the casting of Depp who though one of the projects driving forces seems weirdly unfocused and disengaged in a role for which hes at least 20 years too old; the thesp gave a much more flavorsome gonzo-esque turn as a cartoon lizard in this years ""Rango."" Supporting actors expertly pick up much of the slack. Eckhart and Jenkins are perfectly cast; Ribisi in a hilarious live-wire perf is like a drug that can be counted on to deliver a ferocious jolt; and Rispoli invests his cynical shutterbug with a rewarding emotional undercurrent. Production designer Chris Seagers applies subtle 60s touches to Puerto Ricos sun-kissed exteriors and grotty interiors an effect furthered by Colleen Atwoods retro costumes. The jazzy flowing rhythms of Christopher Youngs score provide a continually sultry backbeat. The Rum DiaryProductionA FilmDistrict release of an Infinitum Nihil GK Films production.

Given that its been on the shelf for two years and never popped up on the festival circuit the whiff of trouble has hung over The Rum Diary for some time so there is relief in discovering that the film is not so bad after all. Robinson wrote and directed one of the most memorable entries in the annals of alcoholic cinema Withnail amp; I and a certain affinity can be felt. But whats sorely missing here is the raffishness and rudeness of the 1987 English film as well as some concomitant spark in Depps performance that would hint at the wild man and talent to come. PHOTOS Stills From The Rum Diary Thompson wrote The Rum Diary his second attempt at a novel in the early 1960s after having spent a year or so trying without much success to be a newspaper reporter in San Juan Puerto Rico. Depp so the story goes found the unpublished manuscript in the writers Colorado home sometime in the 1990s urged him to finally publish it and started plotting a film version. Heavily autobiographical the book dwells on the depredations of newsmen in a world that today is nostalgically regarded as both seedy and glamorous. PHOTOS Johnny Depps Most Memorable Career Moments So youthful does Depp continue to look that it never seems odd that hes playing a journalist at the beginning of his career. Unlike Thompson himself who was barely past 20 at the time of his Caribbean sojourn his fictional alter ego Paul Kemp readily finds a position with the ragtag rag The San Juan Star where high alcoholic intake is a job requirement; asked about his drinking habits Kemp replies ""I suppose at the upper end of social"" which is good enough for bedraggled editor Lotterman (Richard Jenkins). Taken under wing by 40ish staff photographer Sala (Michael Rispoli) an engagingly mangy sort who by now seems too acclimated to the tropics to ever leave Kemp tries to behave himself even after meeting the bewitchingly sexy Chenault (Amber Heard) the flirty fiancee of Yank entrepreneur Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart). Very smoothly the businessman lures the susceptible scribe into his web with the covert intent that favorable coverage in the Star will help him and fat cat government-connected developers pull off a real estate scam giving them exclusive building rights in a privileged portion of paradise. PHOTOS Inside Pirates of the Caribbean Kemp is alert enough to pick up the warning signs and even goes on the wagon for a while to regain his balance. But Sanderson gains the upper hand by bailing him out of jail and the myriad benefits of going along including cash a gratis red Corvette deluxe vacation destinations and decisively the continued presence of Chenault prove too much. The story thus emerges as a contest between the seductions of corruption and summoning the strength to do the right thing. Given the source its not at all surprising that the path to moral clarity is provided by a raving lunatic Moberg (an excellent Giovanni Ribisi) a one-time Star staffer too far gone on booze and drugs to function but whose reckless advance through the doors of perception positions him as a precocious forerunner of the counterculture to come. VIDEO The Rum Diary Trailer Johnny Depp Drinks His Way Through Puerto Rico Despite this link between accepted/current and illicit/future forms of mood enhancement as well as the ""bad influence"" theme reminiscent of Withnail The Rum Diary remains a relatively mild diversion not at all unpleasant but neither compelling nor convulsive. This stems in significant measure from the diffident nature of Depps character; hiding behind dark shades much of the time and affecting a hipster stance while remaining relatively cautious and noncommittal Kemp doesnt inspire strong engagement. Strangely enough theres a dose of Jack Sparrow in the characterization albeit without the weird makeup and accoutrements in that Kemp sort of bumbles into situations in a faux-innocent way without particular focus or intent and somehow muddles through. Without the allure and quirkiness that Depp provides Kemp would be a pretty innocuous fellow especially in comparison to some of those surrounding him. A fine character actor heretofore without the benefit of a defining role Rispoli excels as a garrulous lensman whos probably talented but seems destined to a second-rate existence due to laziness and significant character defects. Although his phony wig is played for laughs Jenkins frazzled editor might profitably have been more pitched toward outright comedy to provide the film with more tonal variety. Conceptually Chenault is a stock fantasy character a teasingly unavailable object of desire designed to mesmerize. Many a pretty young actress could have filled this requirement but Heard charges the standard-issue role with moments of something extra a fleeting sense of abandon unscripted wildness inchoate yearning that couldnt have been planned but emerged in a fortuitous fusion of glance turn of the head youthful glow lighting and camera angle. Stunningly beautiful Heard creates tiny heartbreaks for this girl who is both free and trapped one of natures elite and yet possibly doomed. As very few American films have been shot there locations representing San Juan and environs a half-century ago are suitably fresh and evocative. The eclectic soundtrack also contributes to the smartly nostalgic feel.
