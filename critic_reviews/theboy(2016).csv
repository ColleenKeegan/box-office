(Mongrel Media) A still from The Boy and the Beast.(Mongrel Media) FILM REVIEW The Boy and the Beast is gorgeous but its characters lack development Add to ... Johanna Schneller Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday May 27 2016 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday May 27 2016 1200AM EDT Comments AA Directed by Mamoru Hosoda Written by Mamoru Hosoda Starring Bryn Apprill Kumiko Aso Classification PG Country USA Language English ""Do you know why beasts and humans live in separate worlds?"" wise Iozen a warthog-man asks in this anime fantasy from award-winning Japanese writer-director Mamoru Hosoda. ""Humans are weak and harbour darkness in their souls."" Thats a promising idea but unfortunately said darkness is just generic teen angst in this cross between Beauty and the Beast and The Karate Kid. Ren a nine-year-old orphan slips into an alley in Tokyos Shibuya district and emerges into a warm-hued world of anthropomorphic beasts. Hes apprenticed to intemperate Kumatetsu (resembling a gruff exile from Disneys Country Bear Jamboree) who is vying with Iozen to become lord of the beasts. Naturally man and manimal have much to learn from each other. Too bad the lessons arent more original. The film which was named Animation of the Year at the Japan Academy Prizes is gorgeous to look at. The soundscape is rich and the beast-battles well executed. But the characters never develop beyond their two-word descriptors Conflicted Boy Lonely Girl Angry Son etc. Report Typo/Error Follow us on Twitter GlobeArts More Related to this Story film review Hevn Thriller fails to stand out in revenge genre film review Mr. Right is a delirious mix of crime kidnapping dating and knife-throwing film review Sour Grapes Caper-tale doc explores a world of greed wine and money Comments AA In the know Life This woman became a middle-age man magnet.

Close Join the conversation... With Nancy Churnin Share This Story Share Discuss Meh Like the Pevensie children tumbling through a wardrobe to Narnia or Harry Potter tapping a brick on a wall to get to Diagon Alley the 9-year-old boy in Mamoru Hosodas exquisitely animated The Boy and the Beast finds a magical pathway between two worlds.Ren as hes called in a human world with subway stations and Starbucks signs follows a narrow alley that takes him to the world of beasts. There he becomes a reluctant apprentice to the fanged furry and difficult warrior Kumatetsu who renames the boy Kyuta the Japanese word for his age. Must See Movies Five films worth your time in theaters this week The two squabble with Kumatetsu yelling that Kyuta needs to find the sword in his soul. Frustrated Kyuta has a breakthrough when he figures out the only way to learn from Kumatetsu is to mimic his moves. Its funny and touching stuff but much as the Harry Potter tales deepened as the narrative progressed Hosodas complex tale also proves to have high emotional stakes.Ren fled to the beast world because he hates the human one where his mother died and he cannot find his divorced absent father. At 17 when he accidentally finds the alley that takes him back into the human world hes drawn to a library struggling to decipher words in Moby-Dick. With the help of Kaede a kind young woman who helps tutor him he tries to reconcile and deal with wars from the beast world that spill over into the human one. While young children may be drawn to the Beauty and the Beast spin on a teacher-student relationship and the cute white mouse that accompanies Ren/Kyuta on his travels the apt PG-13 rating reflects the frightening anger and anguish manifestated in the boys physical world. Questions may linger about whats real and whats projected from Rens turbulent feelings but the film creates such vivid worlds on both sides of the alley youll root for their coexistence.The original version presented with English subtitles opened in Japan in 2015 and offers deeply satisfying performances. It will alternate in Dallas with an English dubbed version (not reviewed) featuring names familiar to local audiences including Dallas Theater Center Brierley Resident Acting Company member Alex Organ as Kumatetsus gentle beast friend and Jessica Cavanagh as Rens mother. THE BOY AND THE BEASTDirected by Mamoru Hosoda. PG-13 (for some violence). 119 minutes. At the Angelika Dallas AMC Parks at Arlington and Studio Movie Grill on Northwest Highway.

(Funimation Films)GALLERY A runaway stumbles into a world of strange... (Funimation...)By Tirdad Derakhshani Staff WriterPosted March 04 2016Japanese anime seems dominated by overstylized action flicks populated by squeaky-voiced kids whose ability to rain down death and destruction belies their babyish features.Not so the work of Mamoru Hosoda. Best known in America for Summer Wars (2009) and Wolf Children (2012) Hosoda crafts sublimely beautiful coming-of-age stories. The kids in his movies may start out petulant irresponsible and selfish but invariably they grow up.The Boy and the Beast the directors latest coming-of-age story is a brilliant funny morality tale that examines the transformative effects of martial-arts training.It tells the life story of Ren a 9-year-old runaway so deeply wounded by the death of his mother that he has decided to hate humanity.One day he finds himself in an alleyway that leads to a city populated by strange anthropomorphic ""beasts"" as the English subtitles put it. (The Japanese word bakemono translates as ""monster"" or ""goblin."")Hosoda upends the usual take on humans and monsters making the beasts the more refined moral beings. They revile humans as savage creatures.""Humans are weaker"" one beast tells the human child ""and harbor darkness in their souls.""Ren finds himself in the middle of a rivalry between two martial-arts masters vying to become the next lord of the city. Iozen the favorite is a refined skilled swordsman and beloved hero who has dozens of disciples.Ren is drawn to the underdog Kumatetsu an immature hothead who dominates opponents by brute force. An orphan who taught himself to fight this master has no time for anyone else - and no followers. The current lord a wily rabbitlike guru demands that Kumatetsu show he can train a single apprentice before he can fight Iozen for the title.And so begins a long rocky relationship between boy and warrior full of comic banter. Equally stubborn equally wounded by a hard life and both full of rage they butt heads again and again.The Boy and the Beast follows Rens progress for nearly a decade eventually taking him back to the human world and back again to the world of the beasts as he battles the rage within.Even with a running time of 119 minutes The Boy and the World tries to do far too much. Its narrative range rich themes and moral depth would have been better broken into two or more films.Still its a fitting addition to Hosodas remarkable body of work.tirdadphillynews.com 215-854-2736 Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""http//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> comments powered by Disqus Commenting policy | Comments FAQ FEATURED ARTICLESTiffany Trump and Naomi Biden graduate Penn dad and granddad looking onApothecary gardens fuel farm-to-medicine-cabinet movementCruz pledges to unify GOP AmericansMoreDe Mazia Art Brings 2.38 MillionLeader Of Jbm Sentenced To Life Aaron Jones Was Convicted Of Conspiring To Distribute 100 Million In Cocaine.

Credit FUNimation Entertainment Mamoru Hosodas anime fantasy ""The Boy and the Beast"" is a curious hybrid with a foot in two realms. It begins vividly in a gritty and monochromatic rendering of the Shibuya district in Tokyo where a 9-year-old runaway Ren scrapes by.When Ren discovers a mystical portal he is transported to Jutengai a world that will look familiar to fans of the Jack Kirby comic book Kamandi the Last Boy on Earth. Jutengai is populated by animals with humanoid aspects and Ren befriends Hyakushubo a pig aspiring to be a monk; Tatara a skeptical chimpanzee; and Kumatetsu a gruff temperamental bear who resolves to train Ren in kendo.Cue sifu-student training montages and Rens evolution from a defiant delinquent to a warrior of noble bearing with shrill intermittent humor sequences of Ren and Kumatetsu bickering. When Ren becomes a teenager he returns to Tokyo where he meets Kaede a young woman who teaches him about books (and about ""Moby-Dick"" in particular from which the movie very loosely borrows themes). He also re-encounters his father whom he had abandoned years before. And he confronts a giant whale monster when a nemesis from Jutengai comes to Tokyo.Mr. Hosoda is skilled with fight scenes and his settings -- the pastel-hued Jutengai and the drab Shibuya evoked at times with surveillance-camera perspectives and crowd-paranoia angles -- are impressive. But the characterizations and conflicts here are strictly generic. ""The Boy and the Beast"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for mild violence.

EntertainmentMovies The Boy and the Beast an enjoyable anime fantasy Originally published March 3 2016 at 700 am Updated March 3 2016 at 303 pm In ""The Boy and the Beast"" a runaway boy enters a hidden beast-land and is trained by a bearish scarlet beast. Movie review of ""The Boy and the Beast"" The latest anime feature by Mamoru Hosoda finds a young boy drawn into a hidden beast-world where he becomes the apprentice of a reckless warrior. Rating 3 stars out of 4. Share story By Tom KeoghSpecial to The Seattle Times An enchanting if somewhat exhausting anime fable ""The Boy and the Beast"" is the latest feature by writer-director Mamoru Hosoda (""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time""). The film will be presented locally both in its original Japanese-language version and a dubbed English-language version. This tale of twin worlds begins with a 9-year-old runaway boy Ren (voiced by actress Aoi Miyazaki in Japanese Morgan Berry in English) whose mother has died and whose estranged father is out of contact. Refusing to live with relatives Ren disappears into the streets and encounters Kumatetsu (Koji Yakusho John Swasey) a bearish scarlet beast. Kumatetsu is one of two hirsute fanged creatures destined to fight one another for the right to rule Jutengai a hidden beast-land that young Ren enters. There Ren becomes a reluctant apprentice to the wildly undisciplined impulsive Kumatetsu. Movie Review    The Boy and the Beast available in two versions Japanese with English subtitles with the voices of Aoi Miyazaki Koji Yakusho Shota Sometani Suzu Hirose; and dubbed in English with the voices of Morgan Berry John Swasey Eric Vale Bryn Apprill. Written and directed by Mamoru Hosoda. 119 minutes. Rated PG-13 for some violence and language. Several theaters. The pair enters a mutually headstrong abrasive relationship that does not resemble such classic mentor-pupil stories as Merlin and Arthur but which ultimately proves to be the salvation of both.

Suddenly torn between possibly irreconcilable identities as beast and human our hero no longer knows where he belongs. A thoughtful if overlong script openly invokes Ahabs madness in ""Moby-Dick"" as a way to understand the obsessions of various characters in this story. While the audience chews on that hand-drawn animation also pulls a viewer in offering visual density background detail and such intricate delights as the beauty of a bicycle wheel. Anime enthusiasts will enjoy ""The Boy and the Beast"" but so will anyone who appreciates a good fantasy yarn.

(FUNimation Entertainment) In ""The Boy and the Beast"" the latest animated feature from Japanese director Mamoru Hosoda (""Wolf Children"") a street urchin is taken in and raised by anthropomorphic animals. But it is the world of man not beast that makes this coming-of-age movie most touching. The son of divorced parents nine-year old Ren (voice of Luci Christian) takes to the streets after his mother dies in an accident. Through an alley he stumbles onto a parallel world where hes taught discipline by Kumatetsu (Jon Swasey) a volatile bear-like creature who wears clothing and speaks. The films first act is an uninspired fantasy variation on ""The Karate Kid"" as Ren -- renamed Kyuta -- is tutored not by a human elder but an animal. These scenes play out against stylized backdrops that are almost photorealist. Unfortunately the character design of the animals is by comparison flat and underdeveloped. Watching the lion-man Iozen (Sean Hennigan) you might find yourself wishing that his mane would shift in the wind a little bit as he moves. After Kyuta has grown from feral child to awkward young man (Eric Vale) our hero spends more time among humans where he meets Kaeda (Bryn Apprill) a teenage girl who like him also feels like an outcast. The dynamic between these lost teens lends the film needed emotional weight especially when Kyuta begins to search for the father who abandoned him as a child. Ultimately Kyuta must choose between living in the world of beasts or humans while learning to navigate rivalries between and within those worlds. Despite the films fantastical elements his choice is easy The human conflicts are more resonant. In ""The Boy and the Beast"" man must overcome his natural impulses of darkness and vengeance. The world of animals isnt a viable narrative alternative. PG-13. At area theaters. Contains violence and strong language. The theater will screen the film in two versions English-dubbed and the original Japanese with subtitles. 119 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

The latest example is ""The Boy and the Beast"" from director Mamoru Hosoda (""Summer Wars"" ""Wolf Children"").And while its not quite the instant classic that ""Spirited Away"" was it is nonetheless an inventive and yes spirited addition to the genre.The story follows 9-year-old Ren who has lost his mother and runs away from the gruff relatives who propose to take him away. After a shocking encounter with a furry-faced stranger on city streets he follows the stranger through a narrow alley and finds himself in the kingdom of Jutengai peopled by anthropomorphic ""beasts"" with the heads of bears boars and monkeys.There he becomes the apprentice of Kumatetsu a lazy boasting ill-mannered warrior who doesnt know the first thing about teaching youngsters whether beast or human the art of war. ""First you grip the sword"" he growls. ""Then whoosh and bam.""The fantasy world is a familiar one akin to that of ""Kung Fu Panda"" filled with inscrutably wise masters whose lessons arent always readily apparent. But the unlikely father figure of Kumatetsu and his odd-couple bond with Ren have a freshness that will appeal to young people who tend to clash with authority which of course is pretty much all of them.Its also an ""of course"" that the master will learn as much as he teaches his pupil. Equally inevitable is that eventually Ren will have to put his lessons both physical and psychological to use as the fate of both his worlds hangs in the balance.Yet Hosoda who is also the screenwriter sprinkles his tale with fun literary and visual flourishes. His portrait of a modern city often viewed through the lo-fi lens of security cameras is perhaps even more vivid than that of the beast kingdom and Rens climactic battle with an enemy inspired by ""Moby-Dick"" is a visual feast -- even if it also unintentionally references ""Ghostbusters"" (""Choose the form of the Destructor"").""The Boy and the Beast"" might not quite have the storytelling sophistication to win over every adult but for teens and tweens in the midst of their own coming-of-age stories it has the potential to be a wondrous eye-opener.Reach Lengel at kerry.lengelarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-4896.AZCENTRALThe Boy and the Beast (2016) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsThe Boy and the Beast 3.5 starsDirector Mamoru Hosoda.Cast Koji Yakusho Shota Sometani.Rating PG-13 for some violence and language.Note Available in Japanese with subtitles or dubbed into English.Great  Good Fair  Bad  Bomb  42 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//azc.cc/1oRF9iU More Stories Roberts Pence working to overturn Trumps media ban July 29 2016 1201 p.m. Montini Pence decries name-calling.

On the streets of Shibuya nine-year-old runaway Ren (Aoi Miyazaki) discovers a portal to a world populated by anthropomorphic animals. There he grows up in an uneasy apprenticeship with the gruff bearlike Kumatetsu (Koji Yakusho) before returning to the human world. Film Details The Boy and the Beast RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time119 min. More Info EXPAND In its exploration of an intersection between human and animal realms The Boy and the Beast echoes Hosodas masterpiece Wolf Children and the adult Ren being a ringer for that films Wolfman probably isnt a coincidence. But where the lushly emotional Wolf Children dealt with girly things -- a mothers relationship with her difficult children a teenage girl finding her path -- The Boy and the Beast has lots of grunting and sword-fights and general manliness. Its well-made and the scenes in urban Shibuya are particularly lovely but there are glaring story holes even by anime standards A major plot thread requires that the beasts be fooled into believing that Rens fellow human child Ichirohiko (Haru Kuroki) is indeed an animal because he wears a long plush animal hat. Its an adorable hat to be sure but just because theyre beasts doesnt mean they should be quite that dumb.

TWITTER Mamuro Hosodas Japanese hit is the first animation to compete for the Golden Shell in the 62-year history of the Spanish festival. Exit stage left Hayao Miyazaki; enter stage right Mamoru Hosoda? If the Japanese box-office is any guide the recently-abdicated anime crown will next be worn by the writer-director responsible for one the countrys major summer hits The Boy and the Beast (Bakemono no ko). Hosoda who was briefly and ill-fatedly connected with Miyazakis Studio Ghibli a decade ago before branching out with his own organization delivers a raucously entertaining if slightly overlong romp which borrows liberally from existing sources -- its at heart a Harry Potter-flavored fusion of The Jungle Book and The Karate Kid -- but has more than enough character and brio to stand foursquare on its own two hairy feet. Displaying ""legs"" aplenty at home with a haul already well north of 40 million eclipsing Hosodas previous successes The Girl Who Leapt Through Time (2006) Summer Wars (2009) and Wolf Children (2012) the two-hour fantasia debuted internationally at Toronto then made history by becoming the first cartoon to compete for San Sebastians Golden Shell. Its getting a hefty international push by Paris-based distributor/sales-agent Gaumont and will open on 200 French screens in mid-January with theatrical play already also lined up in Britain Italy Australia Canada and the USA. FUNimation will launch the picture Stateside later this year via a limited Oscar-qualifying run before a wider release in early 2016. Japanese productions have landed Best Animated Feature nominations in each of the last two years via Ghiblis pair The Wind Rises and The Tale of Princess Kaguya and while The Boy and the Beast is a more conventional affair than either it is also a more accessible and commercial prospect. Squarely aimed at younger male audiences it follows the travails of street-kid Ren (voiced by 29-year-old actress Aoi Miyazaki) as he escapes modern Tokyo into Jutengai a parallel reality (accessed by simply wandering down certain back-alleys) populated by talking civilized semi-humanoid beasts. Ren is selected as a suitable apprentice by the bear-like Kumatetsu (Koji Yakusho) a rough-hewn behemoth whos one of two candidates poised to inherit the realms throne when the current Lord (Masahiko Tsugawa) ascends to divine status. Over the course of eight years Ren -- renamed Kyutu by Kumatetsu -- receives intensive samurai-type training from his new master/dad-surrogate. But when he reaches the verge of manhood at 17 Ren/Kyutu (now voiced by pinup Shota Sometani) finds himself torn between worlds. For all its corporate banality and bland conformity Tokyo offers the chance of romance a belated resumption of formal education and the possibility of reconnecting with his (wimpish) biological father; Jutengai is by contrast a throwback to a more exciting purer more medieval environment. And it also boasts Kumatetsu whos simply one of the great cinematic creations -- live-action or animation -- of recent years. Making a rare foray into voice work well-established box-office draw Yakusho (best known to international audiences for Babel and for the original Shall We Dance?) helps incarnate a character who gloriously emerges as a truculent but enormously good-hearted cross between 1980s Nick Nolte and Yojimbo-era Toshiro Mifune. A perpetually-bequiffed colossus Kumatetsu dominates the screen with his bluff charisma and knockabout humor to the extent that proceedings flag whenever he isnt around. With the scenestealing exception of Jutengais falsetto-voiced impossibly sagagious Lord a Yoda-like ancient who resembles an outsize white hare and is the most hallucinatorily Ghibli-esque element on view few of the secondary characters make much impact. The humans of Tokyo are in particular a pretty drab bunch with Kyutus semi-girlfriend Kaede (Suzu Hirose) never anything but a perfunctory love-interest. But even Kumatetsus opponents principally the leonine gracefully aristocratic and formidably athletic Iozen (Kazuhiro Yamaji) -- the Federer to Kumatetsus Nadal -- are somewhat two-dimensional in comparison with the swaggering but vulnerable mega-sensei. The ""surprise"" third-act emergence of Iozens son Ichirohiko (Mamoru Miyano) as chief villain is cumbersomely handled by which stage the screenplay has become sidetracked into arcanely supernatural shenanigans with Kumatetsu regrettably sidelined Aslan-style. Rising to the challenge of delivering a rousing finale Hosoda does sock over a spectacular climactic battle on and below the streets of Tokyo with imaginative aplomb. As is the case at numerous junctures here hes aided considerably by Masakatsu Takagis irresistibly slam-bang orchestral score -- music which Kumatetsu-like loudly rejects the idea that less could ever more.

"Review Animated Boy and the Beast draws on emotional depth to rise above typical martial arts saga - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Animated Boy and the Beast draws on emotional depth to rise above typical martial arts saga A scene from The Boy and the Beast The Boy and The Beast Film Partners A scene from ""The Boy and the Beast."" A scene from ""The Boy and the Beast."" (The Boy and The Beast Film Partners) Charles Solomon Although very different in tone and content from his award-winning features ""Summer Wars"" and ""Wolf Children"" ""The Boy and the Beast"" confirms Mamoru Hosodas reputation as one of the most interesting writer-directors working in Japanese animation.After the death of his mother a sullen boy named Kyuta flees the uptight relatives who assume care of him. As he wanders through Tokyos Shibuya shopping district he stumbles into a series of alleys that lead to the Juntengai a parallel world inhabited by monsters. In the alternate city he meets the ursine Kumatetsu a powerful creature who is a candidate to succeed the ruler of the realm. SIGN UP for the free Indie Focus movies newsletter gt;gt;But for all his martial skills Kumatetsu is crude and rough. Although Kyuta disdains the creatures sloppiness he envies Kumatetsus strength and asks to be trained. This mismatched pair doesnt forge a simple ""Karate Kid""-style student-teacher bond. As they bicker and learn and grow Hosoda skillfully juxtaposes broad humor with deeply felt emotions. Kumatetsu and Kyuta must confront linked crises that threaten the future of both worlds. Kyuta battles not only an external foe but the darker side of his nature in a spectacular confrontation that evokes ""Moby Dick"" -- a dazzling blend of drawn and CG animation. Hosoda brings emotional depth to what could easily have become a formulaic martial arts saga. Instead ""Boy and Beast"" is a bracing tale of two flawed individuals who find the love and discipline they need to assume their rightful places in their respective worlds.

One lucky human will decide which of two anthropomorphic (m)animals -- unruly ursine Kumatetsu or his well-behaved half-boar rival Iozen -- gets to rule an exclusive parallel realm in ""The Boy and the Beast"" the latest hyper-imaginative anime marvel from ""Wolf Children"" director Mamoru Hosoda. While Studio Ghibli maestro Hayao Miyazaki shifts his attention to CG and short-form toons Hosoda (whod been attached to direct ""Howls Moving Castle"" at an early stage) nobly forges ahead with the labor-intensive art of hand-drawn animation serving up an action-packed buddy movie that strategically combines several of Japanese fans favorite ingredients conflicted teens supernatural creatures and epic battles. Although only festival auds and genre devotees will show much interest abroad locals have flocked to see how Hosoda has supercharged elements of ""Digimon"" (the series where he first gained notice) to deliver his highest-grossing domestic hit to date.SEE MORE San Sebastian Film Festival Whereas ""Digimon"" was rightly criticized for being an opportunistic ""Pokemon"" rip-off ""The Boy and the Beast"" impressively reconfigures popular aspects of Japanese folklore mythology and mass entertainment into a relatively fresh narrative one whose satisfactions hinge largely on the personality of its characters -- and therefore also on the foreign voices chosen to play these characters in various international versions yet to be cast. While two-time Japanese Academy Prize-winner Koji Yashuko (""The Eel"" ""Shall We Dance?"") captures every surly nuance of Kumatetsus renegade personality in his native language its a thrill to imagine how Bill Murray (who plays Baloo in Disneys upcoming ""Jungle Book"" reboot) or John Goodman (the Baloo of straight-to-video ""Jungle Book 2"") might adapt the incorrigible bear-beast for American ears. The film tells the story of the personal trials and ultimate redemption of the two wildly mismatched characters alluded to in its title. Beastly Kumatetsu is described as rough crude and selfish a self-taught samurai fighter with a He-Man-caliber physique and the head of a (not especially cuddly) bear while the boy in question is an angry nine-year-old named Ren (Aoi Miyazaki) -- later rechristened Kyuta according to his age. Moments after adopting a tiny rice-eating sidekick of his own Kyuta spots Kumatetsu and his chimp-faced companion Tatara (anime regular Yo Oizumi) roaming the streets of Tokyos Shibuya shopping district and follows them down a narrow alley and into Jutengai a world inhabited exclusively by bakemono or shape-shifting supernatural creatures with animal qualities (and a virtually limitless range of expressions in the hands of the right animators). Humans are strictly forbidden in Jutengai though the worlds lupine leader Soshi (Masahiko Tsugawa) is willing to make an exception. Soshi has ruled this relatively peaceful domain for long enough and hes decided to retire and reincarnate himself as a god but before he does the bunny-monk plans to choose a successor. Iozen (Kazuhiro Yamaji) would be the obvious and virtually uncontested choice but Soshi has a hunch that Kumatetsus renegade spirit might be a better fit for the job. Peace has proliferated this long largely because the bakemono refuse to allow humans in (it seems homo sapiens are far too easily possessed by Darkness as an early scene with an angry Kyuta illustrates) but Kumatetsu needs an apprentice to compete and Kyuta is the only soul willing to abide his temper. What follows is a mentorship montage 180 degrees removed from ""The Karate Kid"" or any number of conventional kung-fu character reinventions Kumatetsu proves to be a disastrous teacher losing his temper at the slightest provocation while Kyuta actually manages to outsmart his mentor getting the better of the cranky old bear in a series of amusing scenes that compress eight years of rigorous training and personal evolution into a rowdy bonding experience. And just about the time Kumatetsu and Iozen are set to spar for Soshis throne Kyuta (now voiced by Shota Sometani) returns to the human realm where he falls in love patches things up with his long-lost dad and becomes obsessed with the book ""Moby Dick"" -- a hefty reference whose themes will resonate when the appearance of a massive whale avatar puts him in the Ahab-like position of facing his own demons. Though it piles all sorts of emotional baggage onto a series of already-tired believe-in-yourself cliches Hosodas over-complicated script has the virtue of expressing itself less via words than it does through truly spectacular set pieces. Early on we might have expected the showdown between Kumatetsu and Iozen to serve as the toons climax but in one of the films many surprises it proves to be little more than an amuse bouche for the feast-your-eyes visual buffet to follow -- rendered all the more dynamic by a detail-rich sound mix and nearly deafening orchestral score. In traditional anime fashion things have to spiral into full-blown supernatural pandemonium before balance can be restored though Hosoda orchestrates this chaos with a poetic sense of what each must do for his own salvation giving the title characters their respective whopper-unities to prove themselves as the most heroic boy and beast whove ever lived.
