The killer...2000-08-11James GarnerMarcia Gay HardenCourtney B. VanceJames Garner Marcia Gay Harden Courtney B. VanceWarner Bros. B- Space Cowboys Genre Drama Sci-fi and Fantasy; Starring Clint Eastwood Tommy Lee Jones James Garner Marcia Gay Harden Courtney B. Vance; Director Clint Eastwood; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted August 11 2000 -- 1200 AM EDT Clint Eastwood now 70 years old has been conducting a rueful analysis of the male aging process for years using himself as specimen. The killer who comes out of retirement for one last hit in Unforgiven the emeritus jewel thief planning one last heist in Absolute Power the disillusioned journalist energized by one last life-or-death investigation in True Crime -- theyre all existentially solo men trying to settle accounts in their AARP years. In Space Cowboys which Eastwood also directed and produced he brings along a posse of other squinty old men with whom to compare equipment. And the company does the star good even though the movies arthritic plot does not. Eastwood plays Frank Corvin who in 1958 was part of a team of Air Force test pilots with the right stuff but the wrong attitude sidelined from space exploration in favor of more manageable team players. Now 40 years later a retired Corvin is called in by his former NASA bosses to do what younger more up-to-date minds apparently cannot assist the U.S.s post-Cold War Russian allies by fixing a Soviet satellite still using an antiquated guidance system Corvin himself designed. The obsolete flyboy agrees to help out only if he can hitch a ride to the work site on the space shuttle and take three of his fellow Air Force golden-agers along. The lucky geezers-in-helmets are played by James Garner Donald Sutherland and Tommy Lee Jones. Space Cowboys is poorly engineered lurchingly paced the dramatic conflicts duct-taped together. And the screws only loosen further in a pointless detour regarding some far-fetched Cold War-type hanky-panky. But in distributing the bodily betrayals and spiritual triumphs that mark diminished masculine vigor among four such different old men (and four such different old-pro actors) Eastwood is able to share the vulnerability (and a few jokes) rather than act his usual high plains drifter self. With Sutherland (who pleasantly waggles his dentures) assuming the role of an incorrigible horndog and Jones as a widower romancing the kind of younger woman (Marcia Gay Harden) the filmmaker might have previously requisitioned for himself Eastwoods Corvin actually assays married life with a (sexy) senior wife (Barbara Babcock); he also lightly acknowledges his own mortal flesh. (For a cheap laugh the four wrinkled amigos stand naked during a physical their shopworn butts braving our scrutiny.) ""I dont know how to break this to you. Youre an old man"" a flinty NASA bureaucrat (James Cromwell) tells Corvin. Yet cinematographer Jack N. Green lights the faces of these durable movie stars so handsomely the men fly in an ageless orbit all their own free from Space Cowboys gravitational pull to nowhere.

Some younger viewers will no doubt find the picture a tad leisurely but might still get off on the space-set suspense and special effects of the final 45 minutes. Given the almost total absence of enjoyable and coherent big-star narrative films this summer B.O. prospects look quite good for this ultra-accessible and mainstream Warner Bros. release. In its relaxed mood old-pro assurance and self-deprecating but proudly defiant defense of skilled veterans (sagging skin and all) over callow youth and treacherous snakes of all ages pic reminds of nothing so much as Howard Hawks late films -- specifically ""El Dorado"" -- in which somewhat paunchy but still formidable greats like John Wayne and Robert Mitchum would saddle up one more time and show the young pretenders how its really done. Like those films ""Space Cowboys"" revels in a world of joking macho camaraderie and competitive mutual support among men with names likes Tank and Hawk takes its own sweet time as it dawdles over behavioral and attitudinal displays by its hardy thesps and sports an entirely beguiling disregard for the current fashion in filmmaking style. All the same Eastwood brands the picture as his own almost from the outset first in the bitter anti-authoritarian streak his character exhibits even in encroaching old age and shortly thereafter in the vibrant unapologetic way in which he asserts the presence of both the adventurous little boy and the randy young man in males of advancing years; as in Eastwood films from ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" and ""Honkytonk Man"" to ""Unforgiven"" and last years underrated ""True Crime"" the original dreams of youth and the need to set long-ago wrongs right can continue to provide men with their greatest motivations throughout their lives. ""Space Cowboys"" deftly pulls off the trick of being a thoroughly unrealistic picture set in a highly documented area of the real world. Six-minute Bamp;W prologue establishes Frank Corvin and Hawk Hawkins as the hottest shot pilots on Team Daedalus an elite Air Force group in the breaking-the-sound-barrier era whose members seemed destined to become the first Americans in space until NASA took over the space program and installed more pliable candidates in its astronaut program beginning with a monkey. Forever rankled by this slight and long since retired Frank (Eastwood) is nonetheless the man approached by NASA when faced with an enormous problem A giant Soviet-era satellite called Ikon is breaking down and within a month will fall out of orbit and crash to Earth likely resulting in the breakdown of the entire Russian Federation telecommunications system. Mysteriously Ikons guidance system is identical to that of the old U.S. satellite Skylab which was designed by -- who else? -- Frank the only man around who might remember the obsolete technology of the ancient spacecraft. Cranky and miffed that the man who pushed him aside years ago Bob Gerson (James Cromwell) is the NASA honcho in charge of the repair mission Frank cant really refuse the job since it offers him his long-lost chance at traveling in space. His condition is that hes accompanied by his other Team Daedalus cohorts Hawk (Tommy Lee Jones) now a joyride pilot and widower; Jerry ONeill (Donald Sutherland) an astrophysicist structural engineer and the real ladies man of the bunch and Tank Sullivan (James Garner) navigator-turned-Baptist preacher. Expository info is dispensed at somewhat excessive length and scripters Ken Kaufman and Howard A. Klausner introduce only the mildest elements of conflict Gerson secretly intends to boot the guys off the mission once his own team learns the essentials from Frank and flight director Eugene Davis (William Devane) insists upon sending up two young astronauts (Courtney B. Vance and the vaguely sinister Loren Dean) to help the geezers. But as there is no doubt that the oldsters will prevail and take their seats on the Space Shuttle the film more profitably concentrates on the mens often comical efforts to train for the flight in less than a months time a process that in reality takes a couple of years. In addition to slipping through the medical exams in dubious fashion and stumbling through the rigorous physical workouts the gents are put through high g-force and weightlessness training simulated flights and the assorted humiliations always reserved for rookies. Although best of friends again after a long estrangement Frank and Hawk get into it one night in a flyers bar while Hawk finds the time to kindle a mature romance with NASA mission director Sara Holland (Marcia Gay Harden). Despite the often cheeky attitude of the main characters and by extension of the film itself some genuine excitement is stirred by the liftoff 80 minutes in; impact is facilitated by the seamless combination of actual space shuttle footage and outstanding special effects by Industrial Light amp; Magic that succeed in duplicating ones idea of what hovering above Earths atmosphere is like based on actual photographs. Discovery of some significant surprises aboard the Ikon satellite push the proceedings into thriller mode and an absorbing mix of perilous suspense derring-do personal courage and well-judged self-sacrifice propel the film swiftly through to its rousing and not entirely conventional wrap-up. Eastwood the director would appear to have had great fun here making the incredible believable enough for the purposes of good escapist entertainment and the effect is ingratiating. Except for the fastidiously executed outer space interlude the picture is casual and almost mangy in its style but this not only doesnt matter but may even augment the Ill-Do-It-My-Way tenor of the project. Eastwood the actor solid as ever would also appear to have taken considerable pleasure in working with his co-stars all of whom seem in the most excellent of spirits. Garner and Eastwood go back to ""Maverick"" TV days together while Sutherland and Eastwood appeared in ""Kellys Heroes"" 30 years ago. Jones noticeably but not irritatingly younger than the others gets the most opportunities and scores engagingly as a good ol boy whose humor and decency prevail over his gruffness and inner demons. A shortcoming of Eastwoods earlier films was his unwillingness to cast strong name actors opposite him but hes corrected that over the past decade and its a plus that here extends well down into the supporting cast with a fine colorful turn by the too-little-seen Devane and welcome appearances by the likes of Blair Brown and Barbara Babcock in quite small parts. Pic was made with the full cooperation of NASA resulting in helpful location work at the Johnson Space Center in Houston and the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Lennie Niehaus dramatic score which takes over in the later stages from some pop tunes that predominate in the early going is blessedly understated where one normally expects aural bombast today.

"Space Cowboys | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; space-cowboys ) Space Cowboys (United States 2000) A movie review by James Berardinelli In a year of debacles and big budget implosions like Supernova Mission to Mars and the unforgettable Battlefield Earth the task of creating the most satisfying science fiction movie (to date) has been left to veteran director Clint Eastwood. While his overlong Space Cowboys is not a portrait of cinematic perfection it is consistently engaging features likable irascible characters and does not descend into the shoot-and-scoot idiocy that has marked far too many recent outer space endeavors. While there are definitely a few plot point similarities between Space Cowboys and Armageddon in tone and approach Eastwoods effort owes more to Contact. During the course of a long and productive career as an actor producer and director Eastwood has worked in a wide variety of genres. As the Man With No Name he strode through several of the best-known ""Spaghetti Westerns."" As Dirty Harry Callahan his lips spat out one-liners as quickly as his gun spewed lead. He has also been a secret service agent in In the Line of Fire an investigative journalist in True Crime a thoughtful photographer in The Bridges of Madison County and Clyde the orangutans best friend in Every Which Way But Loose/Every Which Way You Can. Behind the camera he has directed such well-respected movies as Heartbreak Ridge White Hunter Black Heart and Unforgiven. However before Space Cowboys he has never been into outer space nor has he worked with such a lavish special effects budget. (Virtually every shot in the last 45 minutes appears to have been visually enhanced.) In 1958 the four men of Team Daedalus were the most experienced and daring that the Air Force had to offer. With their eyes on some day reaching outer space they piloted prototype airplanes that broke speed and altitude records until their boss Bob Gerson shut them down when NASA was created. The team broke apart each of them heading in separate directions - until 40 years later when the orbit of the Russian communications satellite Icon begins to decay. The satellite has only five weeks before it burns up in the atmosphere and the Russians are worried that its loss will cripple their telecommunications infrastructure and perhaps start a civil war. Gerson (James Cromwell) now a bigshot at NASA sees an opportunity to help the Russians save face. But Icons antiquated guidance system will not respond to commands sent from Earth and no one currently at NASA knows how to fix it. So grudgingly Gerson approaches Frank Corvin (Eastwood) the leader of Team Daedalus and the creator of Icons ""dinosaur"" guidance system. Frank agrees to help but theres a condition he and the other three members of his team - pilot Hawk Hawkins (Tommy Lee Jones) navigator Tank Sullivan (James Garner) and structural engineer Jerry ONeill (Donald Sutherland) - must be on the space shuttle when it launches. NASA counters with terms of its own. Frank must agree to take two current astronauts Ethan Glance (Loren Dean) and Roger Hines (Courtney B. Vance) with him and the members of Team Daedalus must be able to qualify for the trip by passing the training program. The longest portion of Space Cowboys is the setup which comprises about 60% of the running length. While I appreciate movies that take the time to introduce the characters and situations and slowly ease into the action Space Cowboys lets this part of the film run too long. Some of the material presented during this portion is redundant and unnecessary such as the lengthy sequence in which the Team Daedalus members are reunited and the obligatory barroom brawl which emphasizes interpersonal friction were already aware of. The same degree of character development and background material could have been presented in about two-thirds of the time. Once the action shifts to the space shuttle however things move at a taut pace. Those going to Space Cowboys expecting aliens and space warfare will have wandered into the wrong theater. The films intent is not to challenge the likes of Independence Day and Star Wars. The premise is not designed to test a viewers willing suspension of disbelief. Space Cowboys uses technology that is currently available and as an engineer I didnt notice any obvious goofs. But as Apollo 13 taught viewers its possible to have a low-key space adventure with a great deal of tension - all that must happen is for something to go wrong. And thats exactly what fuels this movies climactic segments. A significant portion of Space Cowboys appeal results from the four leads all of whom possess high viewer recognition and comfort levels. We like these guys and enjoy being in their company for two hours. Eastwood is careful to balance the ensemble not giving himself all the prime material. For example Garner and Sutherland share the best one-liners and Jones gets the girl (in this case Marcia Gay Harden). This allows Eastwood to do what he does best - stay calm under pressure and perform some low key heroics. The sense of camaraderie within the group is more tangible than in many of the conventional buddy movies that invade multiplexes on a regular basis. The second half of Space Cowboys is special effects-laden. These are not cutting-edge Star Wars visuals; theyre merely designed to convince viewers that the action is transpiring in space. Except for an occasional glitch they succeed at that and the few awkward moments do not distract for long. There is however one instance in which postproduction work creates an odd effect. During the ten minute black-and-white 1958 prologue the five main characters (the Team Daedalus members and Gerson) are played by younger actors but their dialogue is dubbed by Eastwood Jones Garner Sutherland and Cromwell. This generates an unusual audio/visual disconnect. Undoubtedly the return of John Glenn to space was the inspiration for Ken Kaufman amp; Howard Klausners screenplay. In the movies putting senior citizens in space is nothing new (consider the crew of the Starship Enterprise) but this is the first time it has been done semi-realistically. The screenplay incorporates a lot of material including secret cold war politics cover-ups political infighting melodrama media manipulation male bonding and of course science fiction action/adventure. Some of these elements work better than others but taken as a whole they make for an entertaining ride. Space Cowboys is a blast for those who dont mind geriatric heroes.

Directed by and starring Clint Eastwood. Co-starring Tommy Lee Jones Donald Sutherland and James Garner. (PG-13. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Some old guys just keep getting better. Clint Eastwood for one. He directs and stars in ""Space Cowboys"" a comedy adventure about a former team of fighter-pilot aces now pushing 70 sent into space to repair a Russian satellite that is more decrepit than they are. This is the stuff of geezer comedy and throughout the middle section of the movie it is a superior example of this rather worn-out genre. Theres a lot more going on however with some real pros -- including Tommy Lee Jones Donald Sutherland and James Garner -- who know how to bring it off. As ""Space Cowboys"" progresses from comedy to adventure to fable about settling old grudges Eastwood does something amazing. He not only sidesteps the trap of turning himself into an old fool he reasserts himself as the movie icon audiences for decades have come to expect. He might not like to hear it but its a lovely thing to see. Its taken until August but ""Space Cowboys"" can now lay claim to the title of best movie of the summer. It is Eastwoods most satisfying film since ""Unforgiven"" in 1992. ""Space Cowboys"" begins like the careers of most of its stars in black and white. It is 1958 at an Air Force test range. In a sequence with some whiz-bang aerial photography the lifelong rivalry of pilots Frank Corvin and ""Hawk"" Hawkins has already begun. It picks up decades later when old Frank (Eastwood) comfortably retired but ""proficient in obsolete technology"" is recruited by NASA to repair a little glitch in a 50s-era Russian communications satellite that could plunge into the atmosphere. Although obstinately never a team player himself Frank rounds up the remaining members of the former team -- the old samurai. The setup is surely a spin-off from Sen. John Glenns becoming at age 77 the orbiting oldster. In a joke about Medicare Franks age is revealed as 69. Eastwood who is 70 Garner 72 and Sutherland 66 play their real ages or thereabouts. Jones is 53 but crinkly enough to make it work. As Franks rival Hawk he gets the funniest introductory scene as a barnstorming crop- duster pilot who now takes thrill- seeking teenagers for a ride. Jones also gets to deliver and does with aplomb the grace-under-pressure lines i.e. ""Hell I thought this was going to be hard."" Sutherland in white ponytail and Coke-bottle eyeglasses is a charmer as a never-say-die ladies man who never passes up an opportunity and if a buck-naked (well almost) physical examination scene is any indication a well-qualified one. Garner has become a God-is-my- co-pilot Pentecostal minister. He may have the least to do but he does it with the self-effacing style of an old maverick. Only so many creaky old bastard jokes can be told in a row. By all rights ""Space Cowboys"" should not have worked and thats one of the things that makes it so good. This bunch of dinosaurs is sent up to fix a dinosaur of primitive space technology which turns out -- to almost everyones surprise including Mission Controls -- to be a relic from the Cold War. The movie takes several cliched situations -- the huffing and puffing of basic training the hotshot who defies the rules the disease of the month for a few examples -- and brazenly stares them down. Understatement works as well for Eastwood as a director as it does for him as an actor. ""When I use a cliche"" he seems to be saying ""it is no longer a cliche."" It was disheartening at first for instance to see one of those celebrity cameos coming this time by Jay Leno but the funny thing is that it works. Eastwood is smart enough a director to get in and out very quickly. A canny thing about the space sequences is that they do not come across as a crunching shift of gears into sci-fi fantasy. The projectionist has not mistakenly put on a reel of ""Mission to Mars."" The old crate of a Russian satellite with its great revolving paddles thanks to Industrial Light amp; Magic has the stamp of authenticity. Theres another old pro around. Its James Cromwell (""Babe"") as Franks former Air Force boss and now a cagey survivor of military politics. The manners of command get a nice workout. Leadership in Mission Control is represented by William Devane and Marcia Gay Harden who calculate life-and-death decisions in an unflappable conversational tone. Harden (""Millers Crossing"") has an extraordinarily poised screen presence. She plays a NASA official who develops an unprofessional romantic link and when she twice leans across the screen toward the object of her affection her warmth is palpable. In the early going it is possible to tell which young actor in the grandstanding aerial sequence will turn into Eastwood. Toby Stephens slyly impersonates Eastwoods cocked eyebrow and suspicious squint. ..
