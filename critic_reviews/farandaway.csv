Its his free-gliding confidence as a star the easy delight he takes in his own charisma. That big toothy grin is actually his least streamlined feature; whats so winning about it is the spontaneity with which he lets it rip. When he smiles he seems to be acknowledging -- to the other characters and to every female in the audience -- that his sexiness is something he cant control. It just comes beaming out of him. Cruise is like a high school girls dream of a brash-but-sensitive jock and as long as hes playing hustlers or top guns or the selfish smoothie of Rain Man hes great fun to watch. But when this creamy-faced superstar tries to hunker down and be a ""serious actor"" hes limited by the very quality that makes him so likable-namely that he seems to have eased through life on silver wings never touching anything that resembles human pain. In Ron Howards glossily old-fashioned Far and Away  a transatlantic immigrant saga set at the turn of the century Cruise plays Joseph Donelly a young tenant farmer who escapes the cruel confines of his Irish village and journeys to America lured by the promise of freedom and land. His unlikely partner Shannon Christie (Nicole Kidman) is an upper-crust Irish girl infatuated with all things ""modern""; she decides shes had it up to her starched collar with life in the family mansion. (Funny how people in movies find it easy to give up that sort of thing.) The two run off together and land in Boston where the feisty impoverished Irish are the lowliest of all immigrants. Penniless theyre reduced to lodging in a whorehouse (since this is a Ron Howard movie its a very friendly whorehouse -- you almost never see any men). They find work in a poultry factory and then Joseph a born scrapper with a fearsome right hook begins to earn money as a bare-knuckle fighter. Cruise doesnt do anything terribly wrong. His Irish accent is fine (if a bit too impeccably rounded) and he works hard to make the plainspoken Joseph seem humble and sweet a modest kid who never backs down from what he believes in. Yet except for the boxing scenes when he can come on like a strutting champion Cruise has no edge no inner fire. He lacks the passionate volatile qualities that might have expanded the character into something more than a screenwriters concoction. Even Cruises muscles seem too smooth. With every sinew and curve sculpted in the gym he scarcely resembles a poor farmer who owes his bulked-up physique to day labor. Machine-tooled and weightless -- thats Cruise in Far and Away. And thats the movie as well. Ron Howards breakthrough hit Splash was a blithe funky comedy romantic in a screw-loose way but in the years since he has turned into an over-controlled Steven Spielberg wannabe. His movies -- Cocoon Willow Backdraft -- have become slick and grandiose. His ambition seems to be to repackage old Hollywood corn with high-tech visual panache. In Far and Away Howard spoon-feeds you the story and almost all of it feels lifted from other movies. The Ireland sections might have been inspired by John Fords How Green Was My Valley -- the characters practically have blarney coming out of their ears. In Boston Howard evokes both the Charles Bronson melodrama Hard Times and with Joseph and Shannon engaging in an hours worth of cute flirtation the amorous gamesmanship of It Happened One Night. After a while Joseph heads for Oklahoma joining the great land rush of 1893. The film suddenly turns into a vintage Western. Theres a horse race thats visually thrilling -- the photography has a dazzling hyperclarity. Then again you have to wonder about a director who fusses over every shot yet manages to make a 2-hour-and-20-minute movie without so much as a single colorful supporting role. One character Josephs rival (Thomas Gibson) is an embarassment -- hes peggable as a stock villain the second you catch his Snidely Whiplash mustache and hear him spit out a pompous insult. Far and Away isnt without its moments. The Boston episodes give you a sense of the desperate ragtag Irish struggling to pull themselves together into a community. And though Kidman is stuck in the cliche role of a ""free- spirited"" rich girl some of her urgency comes through. It was a nice touch too to delay the romantic fireworks until the end. The trouble is the movie is all touches. Far and Away looks like an epic but it lacks flavor and texture. Its so predigested theres nothing left to chew on.

Old-fashioned"" is the word for ""Far and Away"" a timeworn tale of 19 th-century immigrants making their way in the New World. Handsomely mounted and amiably performed but leisurely and without much dramatic urgency Ron Howards robust epic stars Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman as class-crossed lovers who take nearly the entire picture to get together. Cruises name and Howards commercial rep point to a healthy but probably not boffo B.O. life. The closing-night attraction at Cannes pic is notable as the first narrative  non-effects-oriented Hollywood feature in more than two decades to have been shot on 65mm stock (with Panavisions new Super 70 equipment) and released in 70 mm. As created by Mikael Salomon images have a wonderful crispness and luminosity that make the effort worthwhile. If its true as reported that Kodaks new 65mm film allows for shooting at much lower light levels than was previously the case perhaps audiences can look forward to more such treats on big pix in the near future. Buffs will note that the new process -- at least as used here -- boasts a normal Panavision aspect ratio one not as wide as the similarly named Super Panavision 70 process of the 1960s. Long-in-gestation story by screenwriter Bob Dolman and Howard is a standard-issue tale of a lower-class lad who gets involved with the feisty daughter of a wealthy landowner. Dozens of fights confrontations and misunderstandings thousands of miles and nearly 2 1/2 hours later the two headstrong youngsters give in to the inevitable physical impulses obvious to everyone else from the beginning. So much for surprises in the story. This script would have perfectly suited Tyrone Power or Errol Flynn in the 1930s. With just a few mildly salacious adjustments to suit modern sensibilities Cruise ably picks up the reins as a tenant farmer in western Ireland circa 1892 who wants to kill his absentee landlord for torching the family home and in effect murdering his father. Exemplifying scripts notions of both manifest and spiritual destiny Pa gives son Joseph (Cruise) an inspirational deathbed speech about the connection of ones soul to ones land and how Joseph ought to go to America. First however son means to do in the landlord (Robert Prosky) who when met turns out to be a nice chap who feels as victimized in his way as Joseph. In fact just about every character here insists he or she is oppressed. Proskys pampered spirited daughter Shannon (Nicole Kidman) is kept on the tightest of leashes by her mother (Barbara Babcock) and is constantly badgered by her darkly handsome suitor (Thomas Gibson). Latter challenges the uppity Joseph to a duel but saved by the fog at dawn Joseph makes off with Shannon for the States disagreeably consenting to work as her servant shipboard. Arriving in Boston (actually streets of Dublin nicely redressed) at the 45 -minute point the couple is instantly thrown in with the hordes of immigrant riffraff when Shannons silver is stolen. Sharing a room at a brothel the two must fend for themselves. While Shannon toils plucking chickens Joseph in pics most engaging scenes makes a name for himself as a scrappy bare-knuckles boxer taking on all comers and becoming a favorite of the local tarts much to Shannons consternation. However the land still beckons and by the next year all the characters (the Christies as well as Joseph have also come to America) find themselves in the epochal Oklahoma land rush racing thousands of others in covered wagons and on horseback to stake out 160 acres of free soil. All chords struck by Howard and Dolman are of the familiar homespun variety. While fine and dandy for mainstream audiences seeking a comforting good time it also makes for a picture with no edge. A little irreverence and some revisionist strokes would have lent some welcome spice to this bland meat-and-potatoes serving of U.S. history. Some of the detail results in needless dawdling. Josephs sentimental dreaming of Shannon and the couples lets-pretend-were-rich interlude in a Boston mansion are embarrassing and the lull before the big land rush is padding. Most of the films pleasures are purely physical. Seeing western Ireland especially on the big screen is always inspiring (ironically one of the last true 70mm productions was the similarly set ""Ryans Daughter"") and Montana standing in for Oklahoma is also pretty easy on the eyes. Irish production designer Allan Cameron has created a vivid instantly interesting portrait of late-19th-century Boston slums and Joanna Johnstons costume designs are also notable. Cruises physicality is forcibly in evidence which will not be unwelcome to his many fans. Stripped down frequently he is genuinely impressive in the fisticuffs action of pics midsection. His horseback riding (its obviously Cruise) is also thrilling in the monumentally staged land race the likes of which hasnt been seen on-screen for some time. Cruises Irish accent is quite acceptable to the point where one stops really noticing it. Heavily garbed unlike her husband and co-star Kidman has the requisite grit and defiant spirit in her eyes and capably holds her own as the upper-class girl who passes her tests of character with flying colors. As the one-dimensional villain Gibson dashingly reminds of Timothy Dalton while Prosky is a kick as the resilient landowner. Michelle Johnson has a few nice moments as a busty dancer who takes a shine to Joseph at the height of his boxing fame. In a dream job for a cinematographer Salomon fashions a world of great color  loveliness and physical grandeur although his favoring of soft backgrounds indicates that the full sharpness of the new 70mm equipment has yet to be displayed. Also effective is John Williams fully supportive but not at all overwhelming score.

It starts with a casual jokey tension that as the day progresses turns increasingly manic escalating by nightfall into full-pedal frenzy. This tightly coiled farcical structure is just what Howard needed after the dull sprawl of ""Far and Away."" Hes back on the crowded seriocomic turf of ""Parenthood"" and the collective commotion of the newsroom brings out his best showbiz instincts.The paper in question is a financially strapped New York City tabloid called The Sun. Henry Hackett (Michael Keaton) the metro editor has been offered a cushier job at the stuffier uptown Sentinel (i.e. The New York Times) and his pregnant wife (Marisa Tomei) a reporter herself wants him to go for the bigger bucks. Today is decision day. But whats troubling him even more is the breaking page-one story the arrest of two young black men for the murder of two white businessmen in Brooklyn. Convinced theyre innocent hes determined to get the story for the morning edition but its a race against time. He has to do battle with his nemesis the aggressively unhappy penny-counting managing editor Alicia (Glenn Close) his increasingly freaked-out wife is convinced shell be on her own once the baby is born; hes got a paranoid gun-carrying columnist (Randy Quaid) sleeping in his office; and the papers crusty editor in chief (Robert Duvall) is too preoccupied with his prostate problem and the wreckage of his personal life to help. All these pressures come to a melodramatic boil that has more to do with Feydeau than with the realities of journalism. But even when ""The Paper"" gets a little too slapsticky silly its always fun to watch.Writers David Koepp (""Jurassic Park"") and Stephen Koepp a senior editor at Time pay lip service to such themes as work versus family and journalistic ethics but no one will mistake this for an in-depth portrait of tabloid journalism. (Given the current furor over the dominance of tabloid scan-dalmongering in all journalism-an issue the movie doesnt take up ""The Paper"" is oddly untimely.) What they do capture with wit and pizzazz is the ulcer-producing surface of newspaper life-the competitiveness of the story conference the controlled chaos the thrill of the news chase. Their real subject is the adrenaline rush that keeps these journalists hooked to their jobs like junkies making mincemeat of their private lives. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Howard watches over these driven obsessive characters like a benignly mischievous master of ceremonies there are no real villains here. His big impressive cast (which includes Spalding Gray Jason Alexander and Catherine OHara) responds in kind. Led by Keaton at his breezily manic best the actors seem to be having almost as good a time as we are.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

"Far and Away Related Item Go to Video Finder Far and Away By John F. Kelly Washington Post Staff Writer May 22 1992 Director Ron Howard Cast Tom Cruise; Nicole Kidman; Thomas Gibson; Robert Prosky; Barbara Babcock; Colm Meaney; Eileen Pollock; Michelle Johnson Children under 13 should be accompanied by a parent Compare prices for this movie Find local video stores More movie shopping Save money with NextCard Visa ""Far and Away"" the new feel-good epic from director Ron Howard isnt a movie its a cartoon. Thats not an entirely bad thing. Cartoons can be enjoyable. The characters may be two-dimensional and broadly drawn but you wont shed a tear if they fall off a cliff or get squashed by an anvil.This particular cartoon might be called ""An American Tail 3"" telling as it does the story of immigrant struggle in that bubbling caldron known as America. Tom Cruise is Irish tenant farmer Joseph Donelly who when we meet him is scraping a meager existence on Irelands western coast in 1892. He cant own the land he works because its the property of absent landlord Daniel Christie (Arena Stage alum Robert Prosky) whose thugs terrorize Cruises family. Cruise vows revenge.Prosky turns out to be a softie an unhappy rich man dominated by his wife. Theres more spunk in his daughter Shannon (Nicole Kidman). She claims to be ""modern"" and is upset that her mother wont let her gallop on her horse or play the latest in jaunty piano music from America. Shes unhappily continued on Page 44 from Page 42 engaged to Thomas Gibson who -- with his high cheekbones and villainously jet black moustache -- looks like hes just come from tying a damsel to a railroad track.Cruise and Kidman manage to light out for America together where theyve heard land is just being given away in the Oklahoma Territories. She can be free to ride a horse the way she likes; he can grow wheat on his own property.The movies plot doesnt have a whole lot of surprises Arriving in Boston the pair pose as brother and sister are installed in a whorehouse by Irish fixer Mike Kelly (Colm Meaney) and set to work in a chicken-plucking plant. Cruise transfers the sexual energy that comes from sharing a room in a whorehouse with the strawberry-blonde Kidman from his crotch to his fists becoming Meaneys prize prizefighter.What is a surprise is that Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are almost entirely credible in their roles. Hes comfortable with his spud farmer accent; shes much more believable as a naive heiress than as say a knockout brain surgeon (her role in ""Days of Thunder"" the duets previous screen pairing). Its the comic scenes that the real-life husband and wife are best at -- sparring hiding affection mocking one another. They make for some truly funny moments.The only problem is that director Howard (who co-wrote the story with screenwriter Bob Dolman) means us to take the movie as seriously as he does. ""Far and Aways"" light scenes are far and away better than its dark or touching ones. The boxing scenes become progressively more violent with blood and phlegm flying everywhere. This ""Raging Bull""-style realism is jarring when you consider that all the peasants and tenement dwellers are coated with the kind of shiny makeup ""dirt"" last seen in ""Oliver""Incidentally its makers say ""Far and Away"" is the first feature film to be presented in Panavision Super 70mm. There didnt seem to be much difference from the standard 35mm except in one scene. We do finally get to that Oklahoma land rush (filmed in Montana actually) and its a wonderful orgy of galloping horses and overturning wagons. Its proof that Ron Howard may have an epic in him somewhere even if this isnt it.

Far And Away Movie Review amp; Film Summary (1992) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/far-and-away-1992,200,farandaway5,farandaway,rogerebert
"Far and Away Related Item Go to Video Finder Far and Away By Hal Hinson Washington Post Staff Writer May 22 1992 Director Ron Howard Cast Tom Cruise; Nicole Kidman; Thomas Gibson; Robert Prosky; Barbara Babcock; Colm Meaney; Eileen Pollock; Michelle Johnson Children under 13 should be accompanied by a parent Compare prices for this movie Find local video stores More movie shopping Save money with NextCard Visa ""Far and Away"" Ron Howards broad-shouldered saga about Irish immigrants in America is the directors attempt to step into the cinematic shoes of directors John Ford and David Lean. And certainly hes stepped into something with this sprawling old-fashioned melodrama. Though the film is pictorially stunning and at times diverting for the most part its a lumbering white elephant of a movie. Think of it not so much as ""The Quiet Man"" or ""Ryans Daughter"" but as an epic Irish Spring commercial.Tom Cruise is the one who works up the manly aroma here as Joe Donnelly an impoverished Irishman who struggles heroically to make a living as a tenant farmer on the small parcel of rocky land his family leases from a wealthy landlord (Robert Prosky). Its the 1890s and most of the men in this ramshackle western Irish village have been beaten down in the long struggle with their greedy bosses. Joe is still young though and full of spirit; he remembers what his father told him before passing away -- that a man was nothing without land; that ""land was a mans very soul."" This is Joes dream to settle down on his own piece of land. But Ireland is tough on dreamers and before Joe can even bury his father his cottage is burned down by the landlords manager (Thomas Gibson) and Joe treks off to take his revenge.In this opening section the events in Bob Dolans script tumble out in quick succession like a narrative avalanche and with pretty much the same logic. Almost before you can blink Joe is on his way to America with the landlords ravishing modern-thinking daughter Shannon (Nicole Kidman). Shannon who feels suffocated by the mores of her social station entices Joe with an ad for the great Oklahoma land rush. But once the pair -- who can barely tolerate the sight of each other -- reach Boston their plans run aground. Without money they are forced to work as menial laborers banking their pennies until they can save up enough to head West.The movies second section in which Joe becomes a renowned prizefighter while Shannon plucks chickens is as moribund as the first was swift. Though one catastrophe piles on top of another -- you cant really say that nothing happens -- Howard (""Backdraft"") cant seem to get the plot in gear. Drunk with his minor celebrity Joe becomes the darling of a corrupt Boston ward boss (Colm Meaney) and forgets about his destiny out West. Theres so much bare-knuckled brawling in this middle section in fact that for a time the film devolves into a sort of antiquarian ""Rocky"" with Shannon playing Adrian to his Irish stallion.Still though Shannon and Joe share a room in one of the ward bosss whorehouses they are not lovers. Posing as brother and sister they spar and bicker in the classic manner of 30s lovers -- as foreplay. In part Joes fighting is seen as his way of sublimating his increasingly pressurized sexual feelings for Shannon. Dramatically the whole film builds to the inevitable moment of consummation between Cruise and Kidman (who are also romantic partners off the screen) but the courtship is so protracted that we ultimately dont care.Thats assuming that we cared much in the first place. ""Far and Away"" is such a doddering bloated bit of corn and its characters and situations so obviously hackneyed that we cant give in to the story and allow ourselves to be swept away. For his part Cruise has never seemed more lightweight; his job is to embody the virtues of a larger-than-life Hollywood movie star and yet he has never appeared more inadequate to the task. I kept thinking I was watching the second incarnation of Christopher Reeve.As Shannon Kidman at least brings some ferocity to her performance even if the characters gumption is of the canned variety. But her forcefulness makes her co-stars work appear all the more paltry. And that goes for most of the other actors too; their costumes seem to be playing them.The final section of the film in which Joe and Shannon rediscover each other out West is a disaster. With his expansive shots of the rolling plains Howard must have wanted to evoke the spirit of ""Dances With Wolves"" but the narrative is so rushed and the scenes so haphazardly slapped together that the films climax seems perfunctory. Theres no feeling in it. Howard fails to deliver on both the smaller and larger satisfactions of the form hes attempted; he doesnt give us the sense of the landscape or the people in it.

Its his free-gliding confidence as a star the easy delight he takes in his own charisma. That big toothy grin is actually his least streamlined feature; whats so winning about it is the spontaneity with which he lets it rip. When he smiles he seems to be acknowledging -- to the other characters and to every female in the audience -- that his sexiness is something he cant control. It just comes beaming out of him. Cruise is like a high school girls dream of a brash-but-sensitive jock and as long as hes playing hustlers or top guns or the selfish smoothie of Rain Man hes great fun to watch. But when this creamy-faced superstar tries to hunker down and be a ""serious actor"" hes limited by the very quality that makes him so likable-namely that he seems to have eased through life on silver wings never touching anything that resembles human pain. In Ron Howards glossily old-fashioned Far and Away  a transatlantic immigrant saga set at the turn of the century Cruise plays Joseph Donelly a young tenant farmer who escapes the cruel confines of his Irish village and journeys to America lured by the promise of freedom and land. His unlikely partner Shannon Christie (Nicole Kidman) is an upper-crust Irish girl infatuated with all things ""modern""; she decides shes had it up to her starched collar with life in the family mansion. (Funny how people in movies find it easy to give up that sort of thing.) The two run off together and land in Boston where the feisty impoverished Irish are the lowliest of all immigrants. Penniless theyre reduced to lodging in a whorehouse (since this is a Ron Howard movie its a very friendly whorehouse -- you almost never see any men). They find work in a poultry factory and then Joseph a born scrapper with a fearsome right hook begins to earn money as a bare-knuckle fighter. Cruise doesnt do anything terribly wrong. His Irish accent is fine (if a bit too impeccably rounded) and he works hard to make the plainspoken Joseph seem humble and sweet a modest kid who never backs down from what he believes in. Yet except for the boxing scenes when he can come on like a strutting champion Cruise has no edge no inner fire. He lacks the passionate volatile qualities that might have expanded the character into something more than a screenwriters concoction. Even Cruises muscles seem too smooth. With every sinew and curve sculpted in the gym he scarcely resembles a poor farmer who owes his bulked-up physique to day labor. Machine-tooled and weightless -- thats Cruise in Far and Away. And thats the movie as well. Ron Howards breakthrough hit Splash was a blithe funky comedy romantic in a screw-loose way but in the years since he has turned into an over-controlled Steven Spielberg wannabe. His movies -- Cocoon Willow Backdraft -- have become slick and grandiose. His ambition seems to be to repackage old Hollywood corn with high-tech visual panache. In Far and Away Howard spoon-feeds you the story and almost all of it feels lifted from other movies. The Ireland sections might have been inspired by John Fords How Green Was My Valley -- the characters practically have blarney coming out of their ears. In Boston Howard evokes both the Charles Bronson melodrama Hard Times and with Joseph and Shannon engaging in an hours worth of cute flirtation the amorous gamesmanship of It Happened One Night. After a while Joseph heads for Oklahoma joining the great land rush of 1893. The film suddenly turns into a vintage Western. Theres a horse race thats visually thrilling -- the photography has a dazzling hyperclarity. Then again you have to wonder about a director who fusses over every shot yet manages to make a 2-hour-and-20-minute movie without so much as a single colorful supporting role. One character Josephs rival (Thomas Gibson) is an embarassment -- hes peggable as a stock villain the second you catch his Snidely Whiplash mustache and hear him spit out a pompous insult. Far and Away isnt without its moments. The Boston episodes give you a sense of the desperate ragtag Irish struggling to pull themselves together into a community. And though Kidman is stuck in the cliche role of a ""free- spirited"" rich girl some of her urgency comes through. It was a nice touch too to delay the romantic fireworks until the end. The trouble is the movie is all touches. Far and Away looks like an epic but it lacks flavor and texture. Its so predigested theres nothing left to chew on.
