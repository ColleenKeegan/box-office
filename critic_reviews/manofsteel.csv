Facebook Twitter Print Comics Jesus Christ Superman Man of Steel flies for our sins by Wesley Morris on June 13 2013 Weve reached a point of no return with the fantasy movie. The geeks nerds and obsessives have so completely taken over the entertainment industry and so thoroughly know the comic books science fiction television and galactic film series theyre working with that there are no new surprises left. Even when its new its nostalgic. Whether its Batman or Star Trek or Star Wars the audience has been there before and cant wait to go again -- to find the Easter eggs hidden for only them to bask in the filmmakers adherence to sacred texts. This obviates any real expectation that a movie will work as a movie that it will be a piece of commercial art that takes you to some emotional or visceral place. Certainly a few of these movies have cleared that bar Christopher Nolans second and third Batman films achieve this as do Bryan Singers X-Men and its first sequel. J.J. Abramss maiden Star Trek do-over went for something audacious. It contorted the parameters of nostalgia using the seriess relationship to the vagaries of time and space to attempt to free itself from the oppression of fandom. But its sequel gave in and enslaved itself to the original films. Its notable that Man of Steel spends a great deal of time with Clark Kent on a fishing boat in the Pacific Northwest the old stomping grounds of a certain superhero from a far different comic-book universe. Clarks enormous shoulders confirm that hes a regular at the Wolverine Gym but they had better be broad because this guys got a lot to carry. And it isnt just the oil rig that goes up in flames or the school bus that runs off a bridge (although check and check). This Clark Kent has to bear the weight of everything this heavy humorless throat-clearing movie is desperate for him to symbolize. Instructed by his birth father to go to Earth and be mans savior Clark floats from a spaceship -- in a high-tech version of his Superman costume -- with his legs together and arms wide open as if he were on a crucifix. As a younger man in doubt Clark visits a priest and the camera frames him with a pane of stained glass depicting a New Testament scene in the background. As Superman in U.S. government custody he states his age as a perfectly messianic 33 years. Christliness has always been an element of the Superman myth. But this films near literal insistence upon it becomes absurd since director Zack Snyder and screenwriter David S. Goyer dont dramatize the analogy they presume it. This is a so-called origin story told in stops and starts and explaining how Kal-El the infant from outer space became Clark Kent the all-American Kansan. It opens on Planet Krypton an ornately designed landscape of rock and lasers that resembles what would happen if the sets from the Matrix movies had a baby with the ones from Alien. The visual effects on Krypton are clever. The living murals that crop up from time to time for instance are like chiseled and sculpted silent movies and are an upgrade from the Harry Potter films ghostly tableaux vivants. The sets are also temporary. Jor-El and Lara Lor-Van (Russell Crowe and Ayelet Zurer) are delivering the planets first natural-born child in ages and -- given that Krypton is scheduled for total immolation -- also the last. But Jor-El has decided to launch his only son Kal-El into space and toward Earth. Theres something to be said for the films use of flashbacks and memories to explain how Kal-El wound up in Smallville and became Clark (Henry Cavill) son of Jonathan and Martha Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane). And yet all that oscillating gives the film expository texture and no momentum. Having crash-landed from outer space and grown up feeling like a weirdo Clark has embarked on a journey to discover why hes incapable of feeling physical pain why hes so outrageously strong although not why he just so happens to be at the scene of so many near-tragedies. Even once Clark has gotten answers the movie keeps returning to moments from his boyhood adolescence and twenties. These digressions tell us who Clark is but they dont allow us to feel anything for him. The movie is so serious about comparing Clark to the Messiah that it starts to feel like church. Yet the filmmaking and storytelling lack the essential biblicality to bring off a divine incarnation of Superman. We see him perform feats of life saving and enemy pummeling but theyre so generic that they mean far less than they should. It doesnt matter whether these reboots/remakes/reinterpretations work as films. The entertainment comes from some engagement not so much with a general audience but with a fan base. Weve had so many tellings of the Superman story -- the comic books a ton of television shows two very good movies a couple of bad sequels and Singers flavorless if honorable attempt to resurrect the series in 2006 -- that we feel like we at least know the gist. What were being asked to respond to isnt the movie its the myth. In that case you need a director who can make pop theology or theology pop. Sam Raimi achieved just that in a great sequence in his second Spider-Man when the passengers of a runaway El train pass a wiped-out and unmasked Peter Parker from one end of the car to the other after he halts the train. In both the passing and the halting hes in a crucifix pose. You feel the physical toll of martyrdom. Peter saved their lives and they return his mask choosing to see holiness in his humanity. Raimi had followed up a good digitally assisted action sequence with an even better flesh-and-blood encapsulation of belief. Man of Steel is actually more interested in trying to conflate religiosity and topicality. It courses with surveillance drones and military might with an overly cautious U.S. general (Harry J. Lennix) who looks and sounds like our current president. Lois Lane (Amy Adams) is now an investigative reporter so good at her job that she has both a Pulitzer Prize and a government injunction against her. Shes made the Man of Steel her story her source and her sweetheart. Shes professionally committed to him. When ruthless General Zod (Michael Shannon) and his team break a Kryptonian prison sentence of ""300 cycles of somatic reconditioning"" to terrorize Earth in pursuit of Kal-El Zod vows to destroy everything until Kal-El comes forward or someone produces his whereabouts. Naturally Lois refuses. Lois just might let humanity perish in the name of journalistic integrity. The movie has its only fun grazing these big political themes but its not committed to turning them into any sort of principle. Nolan is a producer of Man of Steel and shares a story credit with Goyer. Each of his Batman movies managed to turn current events and political policy into a worldview. Theres no conviction like that in Man of Steel -- just a lot of heavy-lidded winking right up until the finale in which Metropolis falls under heavy siege. Weve seen a lot of cities wrecked in the name of blockbuster entertainment (every week this summer will bring at least one world-ending movie). Michael Bays third Transformers movie brazenly evoked 9/11 and one action movie after another has done the same. This one ranks among the most shameless. By the time Laurence Fishburne playing the Daily Planets editor Perry White is covered in dust and helping to dig out an employee trapped beneath rubble as skyscrapers collapse around them the movie has turned the iconography of terror attacks into pornographic exploitation. Are filmmakers hoping we dont notice the allusions to real-life destruction? Are they thinking that there might be some catharsis in re-experiencing it in movie after movie? What happens in Man of Steel is unseemly not because it evokes an event like 9/11 but because the filmmakers think theyve given us characters we care enough about to fear for their lives. This of course is the risk of these pre-established franchise movies that they assume we know who say Perry White is and dont want to see a building fall on him (or anyone else). But the destruction is in part a byproduct of the climactic chaotic brawl between Superman and Zod (its like watching a jet through its afterburners). By that moral estimation its not disaster porn. Its sawdust. And come the movies coda it doesnt appear to have meant anything emotional to its survivors. I know it sounds as if Im the humorless one. But when Singers X-Men invoked the Holocaust it did so with moral gravity. It conceived the enormity. Most movies shake free of the consequences of all this freighted obliteration the way a child would shake an Etch-A-Sketch. Snyder is an overkill director. 300 Watchmen and Sucker Punch are the films of a man who doesnt know his own strength. (The music credits list about a dozen and a half drummers one of whom is Sheila E.) He does bloated masculinist spectacle Baz Luhrmann with ankle weights. What made the first two Superman movies in 1978 and 1981 work so well as entertainments was how they could scale the tone up or down. Richard Donner gave you a romantic screwball comedy -- basically His Girl Friday -- that established the characters and made you care about them so that when later the comedy dissipates in the face of danger you have a stake in the outcome. You want action to solve the drama and restore the lightness. Snyder doesnt have that kind of classical smoothness. One travesty of a movie this big and expensive-looking and beholden to its audience is having to look at all these actors and wonder why theyre so badly used. Costner and Lane look so right together that you wonder how it is that this is the first time theyve shared a scene. The creases on his face seem to dovetail with the lines on hers. You pray its not too late for them to get a film to themselves. And even if this is just a setup for subsequent movies that will better use them you wonder why Adams and Fishburne have so little to do and why what Crowe has to do is so thankless. And Shannon is completely wrong for Zod. Hes not doing Terence Stamps imperious version of the character. But maybe he shouldve. The part needs shamelessness. Shannon is an interior performer but hes got nothing psychological to play just a costume and haircut. When he and Cavill have to run at each other charging like comets youre embarrassed for him. And its entirely possible to leave Man of Steel with no idea what kind of actor Cavill is. Hes in most of the scenes and yet isnt asked to provide any charisma. The most charming thing about him is the window box of chest hair poking out of his costumes collar. All Cavills Superman is required to do is look hot and fly for our sins. This story has been updated to correct Clark Kents home state; it is Kansas not Iowa.

Imagine a person who is both endowed with virtually infinite and irresistible powers and is invulnerable to any earthly resistance. What would stop such a person from using those powers to gratify his or her immediate desires? A human tyrant after all needs followers and an army; Superman can cow the world single-handedly. Thats the very question that Zack Snyders ""Man of Steel"" tries to work out. The big issues become the pretext for a ponderous movie that has much of the baseline wonder leached out but in return gestures toward bigger questions. The Superman question is not a new one of course. Its at the basis of moral philosophy as in the story of the Ring of Gyges told in Platos ""Republic"" (the ring makes the wearer invisible). I knew little about ""Man of Steel"" besides the scuttlebutt that it had lots of backstory so I figured that the underlying issue would be Supermans coming to moral maturity--and watching the movie I was delighted to catch a flagrant wink to my surmise in a scene that shows young Clark Kent sitting by a fence reading Plato (and attracting the attention of bullies in the process). Yet for all the movies thick dough of quasi-theology it poses through a surprisingly coherent sense of allegory the very question of whether the commonplace theology of modern life is even desirable. The great thing about the character is that its a man who is also super; and this movie made from a screenplay by David S. Goyer (who wrote the story with Christopher Nolan) is by far at its best (and is fairly formidable) when it sticks with his tense relationship with earthlings and with his own attempt at passing as one. But the bulk of the film (in both senses) comes from the intergalactic backstory of Kal-Els birth on an imploding Krypton. His father Jor-El (Russell Crowe) opposes the tyranny of General Zod (Michael Shannon). Defying the planets eugenics program he and his wife Lara (Ayelet Zurer) have Kal-El naturally and to save the newborn send him to Earth. Lara worries that her son will be ""an outcast a freak"" but Jor-El foresees that ""hell be a god to them."" The crux of the action is Zods effort to capture Kal-El (played by Henry Cavill) from Earth and in the process to destroy the planets population in order to colonize it with Kryptons survivors (with the help of Kal-Els genetic code). To set up the terrestrial battle of cosmic forces the movie expends lots of time and bombastic energy establishing the politics and the premises of Krypton civilization. By the time that Zod and Kal-El have their showdown the ruthless space general has got the measure of his opponent telling the earthified and ethical Man of Steel ""The fact that you possess a sense of morality and we do not gives us an evolutionary advantage."" The core of that morality comes from the father; in effect Jor-El is God the Father and Clark Kents Joseph is Jonathan Kent fifth-generation Kansas farmer and man of modest but unshakeable principle. As played by Kevin Costner he utterly steals (and steels) the film. He knows that Clark will be forced to play a larger role than any he intended telling him ""When people find out where you came from its going to change our beliefs."" Later Jor-El--or rather a postmortem materialization of him--gives Kal-El the speech about being a force for good--and also gives him the cape and the tights with a real showmans sense that a religion needs a good logo to put it over. And if theres any doubt about the coherence of the symbolism its emphasized twice that Kal-El has been on Earth for thirty-three years. But the real story of the movie is collateral damage. The destruction wrought on Earth by the malicious Zod is one thing but when the newly dubbed Superman stands up to his fathers killer and Earths ravager each zooming chase through the air and each blow landed wreaks horrific destruction. I found myself thinking of Gog and Magog of Sodom and Gomorrah of the Flood and remembering that the term ""Biblical"" implies catastrophe suggests an unfathomably large and therefore legendary devastation. Beware Goyer and Nolan seem to warn of the morally motivated conflict that you yearn to fight and win; beware of thinking in terms of realizing good or vanquishing evil on a grand mythic scale because when forces that hold the world in the balance do battle even the winners are losers. The entire movie with its thrumming and droning and lumbering and crashing seems especially nostalgic for imagination and morality on the human scale. If its so much more engaging even in its roiling gray clashes than Nolans own movies its due in large measure to the primordial simplicity purity and clarity of the issues that Superman brings in his wake. P.S. The insignia on the aliens chest may as Lois Lane tells him look like an ""S"" here but on Krypton it means (as our own Mr. S. Steven Soderbergh could have predicted) ""hope"" (scroll to the end). More Movies Sign up for the daily newsletter.Sign up for the daily newsletter the best of The New Yorker every day.

There isnt any happiness in those comic book. They are very serious and very similar to this movie. So if you actually know who the man of steel is (which you obiously dont) than you would of gotten exactly what you would of expected out of this amazing film. Clarksaid on Tuesday November 25 2014 33641 PMThe first time I saw the film I didnt really know how to take it on one had it was pretty dark grim and serious (which was pretty cool) that separated it from the flashy Marvel films and the lighter Christopher Reeves films. On the other hand its way to distant in a sense that I didnt really connect to the hero. This Man of Steel didnt try to be a hero actually he tried to escape from the job as far as possible. I know this was Snyders intention but still it looked weird on screen and the hero looked as some guy that was pretty strong who picked up heavy stuff through them on other strong guys but other than that there was no connection to the audience at least thats what I got from the film. Deborah R.said on Saturday October 11 2014 33935 PMThis movie was such a disappointment. The special effects were excessive. Very little effort if any was made in building Supermans personality or that of the other characters. I did enjoy Amy Adams spunky personality at times but the relationship between Superman and Louis Lane is a superficial one with no chemistry at all. This movie only made me miss Reeves quircky portrayal of Clark Kent and his heartfelt performance as Superman all the more. Another thing whats with Kent Srs memory of Superman playing with a cape as a child??? This made no sense since it was not even known who he was. The film even lacks consistency. Its clear that more effort was put into getting everything out of the way to get to the special effects. A battle where Superman has no consideration for the human lives at stake. Another blunder I have to mention is when Kent Sr. dies in the tornado. Look at his hair and clothes its not even blowing in the wind Epic Fail as they say these days. Meh. KCsaid on Monday July 07 2014 74638 PMDear Mr. Roeper Your review and this movie together seem to have inspired a lot of passion This is the internet and youve been presented with the expected range of personal attacks and flawed arguments. For example although it is clear that you were disappointed with Man of Steel BECAUSE you are a Superman fan a curious number of people accused you of being ignorant of canon. I did not grow up reading the comics but I DID watch the older movies staring Reeve and Kidder. Even as a child I thought those movies were little silly but I enjoyed them immensely. I have read a lot of comics but I never did read much from DC. After sifting through a lot of vicious comments in this thread I only found one thing I agree with expectations can really affect your enjoyment of a movie. Lately Ive been trying to clear out my expectations before watching a film and it really helps Its harder for me to be disappointed when Im not ""looking"" for something specific. Out of curiosity why were you disappointed by the lack of joy in the movie? I felt that the movies makers were trying to impress upon us the dire state of humanity and used Krypton as a way to give us a glimpse of the grim future where we continue in our ways. Finally I feel that too little credit is given to special effects. You mention how good the CG is with the same tone I hear from a lot of critics ""Yeah the effects were good but it made me want to vomit"" I rather liked the art direction for this movie. I guess everyone has their own inner imagination and the LOOK of this film rather appealed to me. Teams of artists and CG people slave away to bring us something of this quality and I think their vision is worthwhile. I dont know how many times youve seen this film but would it be worth clearing out your expectations and prior knowledge and just viewing it as a work of art to see if it has any merit? Isaacsaid on Wednesday May 28 2014 15526 PMSimply put this superman movie is just THE BEGINNING All the marvel movies that had sequels were if you noticed exactly the same minus the lack of humor there was no character development because who cares about explaining the origin of not only the title holder but his slightly less important associates. After Johnathan died (By Choice) Superman had to decide if the people of earth would ever be ready for a beimg like him. Also he had to kill Zod because it sets up why in the next movie Batman doesnt like him because if he can kill he is an EXTREME THREAT Batman doesnt approve of killing....but from Supermans point of view what choice did he have?? What prison is there for Zod?? Honestly?? The lack of story is because in EVERY Superman tale you have to go BACK and tell a story WITHIN A STORY Give this movie a break we all hated Superman returns it might as well have been called Superman 5 Clark Comes Back to Check In. Just watch when you old heads amp; closed minded comic buffs get that old cheesy Louis amp; Clark romance amp; ""Oh as Clark I gotta be a dim witted loser"" back. Youll still find reasons to complain. The CGI fights were very needed as how is Superman supposed to fight??? Like batman? All karate and no flash?? I think not weve been waiting for Superman to Kick major ASS like this....now we get it amp;....""The story is terrible""......Really?? Comic book movies now are all about development.....THIS MOVIE WAS MEANT TO KEEP YOU THINKING ""How will the next one be or where will they go with it? Not ""That one from 30 years ago was way better"" Be open Grollsaid on Thursday April 10 2014 91840 PMThis is up there with the first two superman flicks. The action eas non stop Now they need to bring Brainiac or Doomsday out for MOS 3 give Zod and Luthor a break. Bluesaid on Sunday March 16 2014 125039 AMI have to admit I didnt like the movie. I cant claim that I saw the originals nor that Im a hardcore Superman fan but the fact is that the movie is flat. There is absolutely no character development and the relationships they form are shallow and ineffectual. Lois and Clarks relationship is him being grateful to her for not revealing his identity and her thinking hes hot. The only character I felt any connection to would be the female commander who is Zods right hand simply because she is witty and ironic. We supposed to feel for these characters as shown by the situations that theyre placed in but it just doesnt happen. The visuals are there to distract the viewer from the poorly woven story which consist mostly of CGI fights between Superman and Zods forces. However it doesnt excuse the movie from the way that Lois is suddenly kissing with some guy who she met just a few months ago. A sad comeback in Superman films and worthy of only a 5/10. A mediocre film that places too much importance on visuals rather than story. Brandansaid on Monday January 27 2014 73417 PMIts admirable for the creators of this film to try and retell the story of Superman. However the major flaw in this film (which general audiences wouldnt pick up on because they become so absorbed into the action and the visuals) is in its storytelling. The characters are poorly developed as well as the major plot points within the film. Xandersaid on Sunday January 26 2014 34713 PMAs an action movie it was great. But thats not what I feel it was supposed to be. Its a Superman movie for crying out loud. Not fucking Jack Reacher (I know its a new movie but Im younger than most of the people posting reviews so cut me some slack) Superman is supposed to be one of the few nice superheroes and the creators of this horror they call a film have turned him into the Dark Knight without the privilege and a tiny bit more murderess I mean really? And dont even get me started on the story. Yes I am a big Superman fan and yes I have seen the originals and honestly no matter how cheesey they were they were better. Even the cartoons were. I mean why not just tell the story straight forward so people will enjoy it instead of making people confused with the constant scene jumping? The only reason I got it is because Superman has a freakin shrine in my head And one final note why did they feel the need to show the babys junk? I know its not a big thing but it just made me and the GIRL friends that I saw it with feel fairly uncomfortable. And lastly my friends got so worked up by the intensity of the battle scene between Superman and Zod that she was playing on her phone the whole way through Great job Hollywood...NOT Dougsaid on Sunday January 26 2014 32904 PMIm going to abridge my previous comment based upon something Richard Roeper said in response to someone else that it wasnt that he wanted it to be the Chris Reeve movies or that it couldnt be dark- but it was joyless in other ways. Of course sometimes a theme can inherently be a bit joyless as part of its nature. It may also be that so many of the reviews and opinions out there really are judging it by an outside standard rather than on its own merits. Apologies however for that remark.

As the bus sinks below the surface its trapped and terrified occupants frantically seize what appear to be their last gasps of air. Lucky for them young Clark is aboard He lifts the bus back up from the depths and saves the day. But word gets around that something out of the ordinary has taken place--the parent of one of the rescued kids declares it ""an act of Providence""--leading Pa Kent (Kevin Costner) to lecture his adoptive son on the need to be more discreet with his superpowers. ""What was I supposed to do let them die?"" Clark asks. His dad replies ""Maybe."" Wait--what? Maybe Clark should have let a busload of kids drown rather than risk revealing his powers? Forgive me but I thought this had been meant as a rhetorical question.Related Story Why the West Loves Sci-Fi and Fantasy A Cultural Explanation Welcome to the Dark Knight-ification of Superman. Yes the film is directed by Zack Snyder but it is heavy (in all senses of the word) with the imprint of co-writer and co-producer Christopher Nolan whos followed his decade with the caped crusader by taking on the task of rebooting DC Comics other superstar superhero. The tone is somber the palette is grayish and you can scarcely swing a cape without it getting snagged on some moral dilemma. Man of Steel is an audacious undertaking a stylistic and thematic mash-up of Avatar The Matrix Close Encounters of the Third Kind Independence Day The Thing Thor and (especially) Bryan Singers X-Men films. What is open to question--and I confess to finding myself uncharacteristically ambivalent on the subject--is whether the resulting heavyweight summer blockbuster is very much fun.The story begins on Krypton a planet of floating robotic valets and winged mounts that would make a Nazgul sick with envy. Theres just one catch Due to the governments poor management of natural resources (it has taken the ""drill baby drill"" mantra to improbable extremes) the planet is about to explode. Kryptons military leader General Zod (Michael Shannon) responds to this news by fomenting rebellion; its top scientist Jor-El (Russell Crowe) opts for putting his infant son Kal-El in a tiny spaceship and blasting him to Earth. (In a neat inversion what makes this savior-to-be special is that Krypton grows most of its children artificially and Kal-El by contrast was the product of the planets first ""natural"" birth in centuries--i.e. his is a uniquely non-immaculate conception.)From there we flash forward to Earth about 30 years later where a handsome drifter (Henry Cavill) equal parts pectoral muscle and facial hair is making his way across Canada hopscotching from truckstops to military installations. And no before you ask this isnt Wolverine whose reboot doesnt arrive until next month. Rather hes Kal-El a.k.a. Clark Kent (no ones thought to call him the S-word yet) and hes looking for answers about his origins that he cant find in the copious flashbacks to his childhood in Kansas. Eventually he finds them in an old Kryptonian spaceship that can project a hologram of his dead father. But intrepid reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams) also finds him and he pleads with her to let him stay un-found.The question of whether or not Clark should reveal himself to humankind is soon rendered moot however by the arrival of another spaceship bearing his dads old nemesis General Zod. The general who evidently watched The Dark Knight during his long journey to Earth immediately takes a page out of the Jokers book and demands that Kal-El surrender himself or hell start killing Earthlings. Inevitably Zod and his followers announce their Evil Plan for the Human Race and it falls to the newly christened Superman to foil it. This entails a great deal of fighting punches are thrown and cars too; flight and heat vision get their requisite workouts; and Zods starship levels half the skyscrapers in--Manhattan? Metropolis? Either way its played by a combination of Chicago and Vancouver.As the man of steel Cavill (best known from Showtimes The Tudors) displays a magnetic presence and topographic physique in the star-making role that had narrowly eluded him in the past. (He was the runner-up to play Bond in Casino Royale but was deemed too young; Twilight author Stephenie Meyer called him ""my perfect Edward"" but by the time the novel was optioned he was deemed too old.) As Lois Lane Adams shows so much pluck that its a wonder she isnt conscripted for duty on a poultry farm. And the rest of the cast (which also features Ayelet Zurer and Diane Lane as Clarks biological and adoptive mothers respectively and Laurence Fishburne as Perry White) fulfill their obligations with aplomb. I do wish though that Shannon (as Zod) had been asked to dial back his patented brand of wide-eyed crazy at least intermittently. The grim tones favored by Nolan (and Snyder) may be a natural fit for the nocturnal exploits of Batman but when it comes to a flying man in blue and red spandex a little jocularity can go a long way.Theres plenty to like in Snyders hectic rowdy film from the cast to the fluid action sequences to the expansive reimagining of the Superman mythos. But by the time we reach the bludgeoning excesses of the last half-hour--which are more than a tad reminiscent of the finale of The Avengers--its hard to shake the sense that this was an opportunity at least partially missed. The grim tones favored by Nolan (and Snyder) may be a natural fit for the nocturnal exploits of Batman but when it comes to a flying man in blue and red spandex a little jocularity can go a long way. And while there are a few light moments sprinkled throughout the proceedings--a nice exchange with Lois about the meaning of the ""S"" on Supermans uniform; a witty (if preposterous) closing gag at the Daily Planet that recalls Quentin Tarantinos Kill Bill Vol. 2 observation that its Clark Kent who is the assumed identity the ""costume""--such whimsies are few and far between.Man of Steel is by pretty much any measure a better film than Bryan Singers 2006 reboot Superman Returns better cast better action better script. But Singer attempted with uneven success to offer a different vernacular for the superhero movie an innocent alternative to the solemnity of Nolans Batman and his own X-Men. For all its strengths Man of Steel--and in particular the extended fisticuffs of its final third--left me nostalgic for the idea of a superhero who never has to throw a punch.

Most Popular Presented by Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue.

Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip.

BOTTOM LINE Cavill broods handsomely as Superman but this reboot skimps on fun and romance. Why so serious chums? CAST Henry Cavill Amy Adams Michael Shannon LENGTH 224 How do you take your superheroes? I prefer mine light and sweet but these days they mostly come dark and bitter. In the wake of Christopher Nolans ""Batman"" trilogy Spider-Man has gone all angsty Iron Man suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and now we have a brooding ""Man of Steel."" Look up in the sky Its a guy struggling with inner conflict By casting Superman as a literal and metaphorical alien ""Man of Steel"" aims to update a beloved but creaky icon for a problematic post-9/11 world. Its written by David S. Goyer who collaborated on Nolans three ""Batman"" films but this time the dark shadings feel like a fashionable Hollywood pose. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? A reworking of the 1978 and 1980 ""Superman"" movies ""Man of Steel"" can be entertaining and hits some satisfying notes. Brit Henry Cavill chiseled and soulful replaces the cherubic Christopher Reeve as Clark Kent now a scruffy drifter hiding his superpowers. Clark (called ""Superman"" only twice) keeps rescuing folks and moving on like Bruce Banner hiding his Hulk-ness. Its slow going but director Zack Snyder handles the material sensitively. Clarks adoptive parents are played by Diane Lane and a genuinely moving Kevin Costner. Reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams) whose Daily Planet is now edited by Laurence Fishburne as Perry White has grit and swagger but disappointingly little gift for banter. She mostly regards Clark as a source. ""Its all downhill after the first kiss"" she says a dry wisecrack that turns out to be too true. Supermans new costume has trendy new textures (and no red briefs) but the biggest suit to fill may belong to the ruthless General Zod first immortalized by Terence Stamp and here played by Michael Shannon (""Revolutionary Road""). Zod has now-obligatory whiffs of terrorism but Shannon an actor of almost supernatural intensity plays him with a rage and empathy worthy of Shakespeares Richard III. When hes on screen ""Man of Steel"" earns its air of gravitas. 302 MoviesMan of Steel trailer Mostly though the movie panders. Krypton is needlessly refashioned into Middle Earth with dragons and wizards (Russell Crowe pontificates as Supermans all-knowing father Jor-El) while Metropolis is decimated in a long sequence thats part Twin Towers re-enactment part special-effects bonanza. ""Man of Steel"" may successfully resuscitate our most cherished superhero but now he just looks like all the other guys in tights. advertisement | advertise on newsday PLOT An earthbound alien with superpowers must protect his adopted planet from invaders.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Please do not consider the following a spoiler. But it turns out the ""S"" on the chest of our ""Man of Steel"" hero doesnt stand for ""Superman."" At least not on the superlatively strong guys home planet. No on Krypton the snaking symbol stands for ""hope."" Quite honestly though it would have been nice if it stood for ""soar."" Because it was not a foolish hope that this latest reboot of the D.C. comic book franchise with the hefty decades-long history should fly. Directed by Zack Snyder who helmed graphic-novel movies ""300"" and ""The Watchmen"" this tale comes with a strong ensemble Russell Crowe plays the father of an extraordinary baby sent away as his own planet teeters on the verge of an apocalypse. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane portray Jonathan and Martha Kent Clarks human parents. Amy Adams dons her feisty vibe as savvy reporter Lois Lane. And Michael Shannon so recently chilling in the hitman drama ""The Iceman"" brings his frigid glare to Zod the villain from Krypton. Then there was the comforting presence of Christopher Nolan. The director penned the story along with David Goyer and is also a producer. Yet very little of the cultural/emotional wisdom or puzzle-solving pleasures of Nolans ""Batman"" films or ""Inception"" can be found here. The special effects-freighted film even arrives with a storyline perfectly suited for Fathers Day weekend. Born as Kal-El but best known as Clark Kent he is a man loved by two fathers both willing to make the ultimate sacrifice in order for their boy to fulfill his destiny. The ""S"" is given to an infant as his father and mother ship their newborn toward a solar system with a young sun and a blue planet prone to paranoia when it comes to aliens. Or as Jor-El gently describes Earth a planet with ""a seemingly intelligent population."" Kal-Els mother Lara Lor-Van is portrayed by Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer which along with the Moses-in-the-bullrushes quality to Kal-Els departure underscores the Jewish roots of the pop-culture phenom. Its a nice touch but like so many of them in this film it doesnt get developed. Once the action moves to Earth the gangs all here. Lois Lane is going toe-to-toe with Air Force Col. Nathan Hardy (Chris Meloni) and end-running her editor Perry White (Laurence Fishburne). In pursuing one story -- about the discovery of what may be an alien vessel in the Arctic -- she lands upon the story of a lifetime the existence of the otherworldly Kent. It was wise to cast a little-known actor as Superman. While Henry Cavill was a regular on Showtimes series ""The Tudors"" he has flown beneath the radar on under-performing movies. The Brits got a striking cleft chin and an impossibly buff mien. Otherwise he remains a bit of a cipher. The chief problem here is one of rhythm and balance in the storytelling and directing. The movie swings between destructive overstatement and flat-footed homilies. An overly long battle started to feel like the clash of the titans in which we mere mortals are reduced to bearing witness and hoping for the best. Theres that word again. Hope. Costner and Lane do well with the homespun roles but the deepest truths of their Heartland get short shrift. From a meanie-weenie on a school bus to a jerk in a road-side diner the bully becomes the symbol of interpersonal injustice. But what does it mean that we know that the bullied kid or goaded man could crush his adversary and not-so-secretly wish he would? Im not sure its his self-restraint we laud. We certainly cant applaud Snyders retraint While ""Man of Steel"" cheated deep character development it went mad for wholesale destruction be it accidental (an oil rig fire) natural (a twister) or alien-made (a gravity weapon). The last time Warner Bros. tried to resuscitate Superman was in 2006 with ""Superman Returns."" It didnt take. Teres enough groundwork laid here (one might argue the film is all prologue) that this Superman is sure to get another shot. Perhaps this is Hollywoods latest mantra Theres nothing here a good sequel cant fix.

John Shearer/Getty Images video Video Meet the new Superman Nolan has laboured to bring gravity to the dude in the blue tights (the jaunty red shorts have been retired) with a script that repeatedly reminds us that Superman has a lot in common with Jesus except of course for the Lord of Peace part. The movie climaxes in a trio of almost unbelievably long and violent battles where the screen fills with rubble the Hans Zimmer score throbs and rows of skyscrapers topple like dominoes.It all gets exhaustingly bombastic although sequence by sequence Man of Steel is something worth seeing. Shot in a palette of chalky greys blacks and browns it has a kind of Old Masters gloomy lustre. The machinery and weapons in the Krypton world mix speculative robotics with shapes that resemble crustaceans. Action scenes atypically trade grandeur for close-up intensity with lots of hand-held camera work. When Superman flies we are either close enough to touch his face or are watching him from a distance blurring over the horizon like a red-and-blue cruise missile.The film begins with pain of course on Krypton where Supermans mom Lara (Ayelet Zurer) is heaving in birth pangs to bring the little hero into the world. The planet is on the verge of exploding and the baby Kal-El is shipped to Earth where scientist Jor-El (Russell Crowe) declares in plummy English tones that Kal-El will become an ""ideal"" for mankind. Not if evil General Zod (Michael Shannon in a Caesar-meets-Frankensteins-monster hair-do) has anything to do with it though after the first few massive explosions he is temporarily subdued.Years later we meet the grown Kal-El as a strapping bearded lobster fisherman (Henry Cavill) when a fresh disaster on an oil rig occurs. At the end of the encounter the shirtless buff young man collapses into the sea arms stretched wide like You Know Whom.His mind drifts back to his childhood being raised in rural Kansas by the comely middle-aged Kent couple Ma (Diane Lane) and Pa (Kevin Costner). Was life idyllic? Of course not. The young Clark Kent runs from a classroom suffering from some condition akin to autism where visual and auditory information overwhelms him. Then theres the school-bus crash the bullying and the monstrous tornado. Oh why must he suffer? ""Youre the answer to the question of whether were alone in the universe"" Pa Kent tells young Clark.And back we go to Clark at the religiously auspicious age of 33 wandering the world and mostly hiding his ability to perform miracles with his superpowers. Early on he has an encounter with ace reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams) while she is in the Arctic investigating a mysterious vehicle under the ice. This version of Lois Lane is on to Supermans secret from the get-go and no fedora-and-specs disguise is going to fool her.During the same trip Clark also meets Hamlet-style a hologram of his dead father. Jor-El provides Clark with a visually cool silvery Soviet-style diorama of Kryptons history before presenting him with his boots cape and leotard with the big S (a Krypton symbol of hope). Given the elaborate set-up the outfit seems even sillier than in less self-important versions of the story.As it happens this is precisely the right time in the plot to suit up. General Zod recently liberated from his prison (and sporting a hipster goatee though otherwise unchanged in 33 years) has parked a space ship in the Earths lunar orbit and by seizing the airwaves in low-definition graphics demands that earthlings surrender the Krypton citizen in their midst or face annihilation. Zod is after a certain ""codex"" that arrived with Kal/Clark that contains the key to rebuilding the Krypton species. (Jor-El the hologram wont stay silent and returns again to remind us a few more times that Kal-Els destiny is to ""save"" mankind.)All this in essence is an hour-long preamble before the main action of the film which involves Superman making a choice between Krypton nature or earthly nurture. The flashback structure employed by David S. Goyer (with Nolan as a co-writer) is a fairly effective way to move us forward in the over-told Superman story. Where the script grates is in the dialogue which is either serviceable as exposition or in that faux archaic style beloved by bad science fiction. Shannons Zod is particularly liable to dropping pompous warnings between murder attempts (""I will harvest the codex from your sons corpse and rebuild Krypton atop his bones"").""Atop?"" Over the top is is more like it especially in the final scenes of CGI mayhem that grow progressively more outlandish with separate battles with Zod a fashion punk/ninja sidekick (Antje Traue) and finally giant ""world-builder"" machines too similar to the monsters in Transformers that descend to give the planet a painful make-over.The casting is strong throughout with Costner and Lane as particularly sympathetic figures.As Superman (the name is barely used in the film) Cavill with his square jaw and sensitive features is fine as an emotionally conflicted demigod although his character for a guy pushing his mid-30s still feels callow. He shows more tenderness with his mother than he does in his barely flickering romance with Lois Lane.Adamss Lois as a seasoned no-B.S. reporter  is a great improvement over the usual gullible starry-eyed versions of the character. The romance no doubt will develop in sequels - or at least Lois can whip Clark into a less wounded vulnerable version of Superman.Perhaps thats too hopeful. Superman like most of our postmillennial comic book heroes (Thor Avengers Batman) is not a character any more. Hes a brand to be marketed in 3-D cinemas around the globe to provide an entry point for audiences to watch endless simulated spectacles of mass urban disasters with an indefinite number of sequels to come. Kryptonite the substance that renders Superman powerless is never mentioned in Man of Steel The filmmakers may have confused it with a sense of humour.

PICTURES BY MICHAEL SRAGOW / ORANGE COUNTY REGISTER Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF Man of SteelStarring Henry Cavill Amy Adams Russell Crowe Diane Lane and Kevin Costner Behind the scenes Directed by Zack Snyder Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence action and destruction and for some language Running time 2 hours 23 minutes Playing Opens at 1201 a.m. June 14 throughout Orange County (See theaters and movie times for 3D version standard version and IMAX Experience)The quick hitThis revamped bloated origin story about Supermans roots on Krypton and his gradual emergence as a defender of the Earth is so stuffed with pro-wrestling-like fights and over-scaled effects that its wearying and numbing. Grade C- ""Man of Steel"" would have played better on Krypton. It tries to dramatize that the liberty and individualism Superman finds on Earth are vastly superior to the social engineering and conformity that doomed his birth planet. But its so devoid of humor surprise or spontaneity that you might think it was made by everyday Kryptonians. All its ingenuity goes into giant insectile machines and tableaux of mass destruction. The mechanical storytelling swamps a first-rate cast that wants to breathe new life into an aging pop myth. The elaborate opening sequence set during Kryptons final days depicts Supermans birth as ""Kal-El"" with unwonted reverence. His father - Kryptons greatest scientist Jor-El (Russell Crowe) - believes that stripping the planet of its resources has worn out its core and made it volatile. Hes been urging the decrepit ruling council to find other habitable planets just as Kryptonians did in the past. He and his wife Lara (Ayelet Zurer) hatch a secret plot to bring Kal-El into being through Kryptons first natural birth in centuries. They point his escape capsule toward Earth before their own planet goes to pieces. Jor-Els antagonist - and later Supermans - is the rebellious General Zod (Michael Shannon) a super-fascist who wants to decide which of Kryptons bloodlines will survive. The film displays its terminal mediocrity when Zod surrounds Jor-Els citadel and orders his forces to concentrate their fire on the main door. Did it really take a super-Kryptonian brain to come up with that strategy? Zod and his fellow mutineers are soon captured and sent to the Phantom Zone for an eternity. Before the movie is halfway over you know what that must feel like. General Zack - I mean Zack Snyder the director -- proves to be as single-minded as General Zod who escapes from the Phantom Zone when Krypton implodes and pursues Kal-El to Earth. (Thats the plot in a nutshell.) Snyder doesnt aim to celebrate the freshness and innocence of the worlds first comic-book superhero or have fun with him as man and Superman the way director Richard Lester did brilliantly in ""Superman II"" and parts of ""Superman III."" In this bloated version of an ""origin story"" he laboriously depicts Supermans growing pains as they stretch out for three decades from childhood and adolescence to his belated emergence in a revamped version of his trademark blue union suit. Even after Kal-El lands in Kansas and is adopted by Jonathan and Martha Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane) there is no joy in Smallville. As a schoolboy he cowers from his teacher and his classmates because of sensory overload; he freaks out when his X-ray vision lets him see the skulls beneath their skin. Understandably he suffers from PKSD Post Kryptonic Stress Disorder. Lane is uncanny as Martha Kent when she talks him through it. But shouldnt there be a little merriment in a boy learning that he has super-powers? (For non-initiates Earths gravity which is lesser than Kryptons and the radiation of its sun which is younger than Kryptons empower Kal-El/Clark with super-strength heat vision an ability to leap whole continents in a single bound and so on.) In a rare lighthearted moment Clark cavorts in a makeshift cape and Pa Kent has some kind of premonition. Since the world of this movie contains no other superheroes or caped crime-fighters you wonder ""Which pop fantasy figure is this kid imitating? Zorro?"" Costners ability to imbue Jonathan Kent with an aura of sagacity gets sorely tested because he keeps telling Clark to hide his gifts - Kent believes earthlings are not ready to accept a super-gifted refugee from another planet. Really? In the 1980s and 1990s? Its as if Americans hadnt made hits of ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and ""E.T."" and ""The X-Files."" ""Man of Steel"" leaves little breathing room for the actors (including stalwarts like Christopher Meloni and Richard Schiff) and no space for the free play of imagination. Its all exposition. The script written by David S. Goyer from a story by him and Christopher Nolan (yes that Christopher Nolan) hinges on two items Kal-El carries from Krypton ""the codex"" and ""the command key."" It takes the whole movie to explain them. Structurally ""Man of Steel"" is just a mess. When Zod tries to gain control of them in order to turn Earth into New Krypton the movies first and last acts link up and squeeze out the rest of the movie. By then Snyder and Goyer have intercut the Smallville scenes with Clark Kent questing as an adult to find his roots and his purpose in life. Clark and Lois meet when shes snooping around an unidentified frozen object in the Arctic that turns out to be a Kryptonian scouting ship. He uses his heat vision to cauterize a wound in her midriff - the best this movie can do in the way of grand romantic gestures. Back in Metropolis Perry White (Laurence Fishburne) refuses to run her story. In fact thats all he does until Zod attacks Metropolis. As a female soldier exclaims Henry Cavills Superman is ""hot"" all right and he and Amy Adams have screen presence to burn. But they burn it all just trying to make us believe that their characters even like each other. They never establish a bantering tone and barely conjure any rapport. What they have is the sci-fi equivalent of a foxhole romance. Can this relationship last? You have to take it on faith. And the word ""faith"" gets tossed around almost as much as codex and command key. Kal-Els escape through space in a small ship resembles Moses floating in a basket through the bulrushes but this movie fills his tale with Christian overtones. His natural birth is as momentous as an immaculate birth. He grows up turning the other cheek. The script makes clear that when he almost loses his life defending Earth hes 33 years old. As Superman/Kal-El/Clark Kent he is his own three-in-one. At its nadir the movie associates ""evolution"" with Zod and his followers. I guess it makes sense that these moviemakers would want to devalue evolution. With ""Man of Steel"" they take high-tech moviemaking back to the narrative Stone Age.

George Reeves wore the cape in the television series ""Adventures of Superman"" from 1952 to 1958.

AP/AP Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. By Ann Hornaday June 13 2013 Follow AnnHornaday Newly minted superstar Henry Cavill makes a well-built handsomely credible Superman in ""Man of Steel"" -- or at least he will in an already-planned sequel that with luck will more thoughtfully exploit his talents. For now audiences can only speculate as to the hidden depths of Cavill who in Zack Snyders busy bombastic creation myth is reduced to little more than a joyless cipher or dazzling physical specimen. Produced by Christopher Nolan who brought such grim self-seriousness to the ""Batman"" franchise ""Man of Steel"" clearly seeks the same brand of grandiose gravitas. But that dour tone turns out to be far more appropriate for a tortured hero brooding in his cave than for an all-American alien who is as much a product of the wholesome windswept Plains as a distant planet called Krypton. Snyder and his writer David S. Goyer accentuate Supermans intergalactic provenance in ""Man of Steel"" which opens on Krypton just as the planet is crumbling the rogue General Zod (an alarmingly skeletal Michael Shannon) is threatening a coup and the wise scientist Jor-El (Russell Crowe) is sending his infant son Kal-El into the cosmos in order to begin the world over again. Seeking to cram as much back story as possible into a movie that feels like a reboot prequel and creation myth all in one Snyder and Goyer then leap forward to a time when Kal -- now an adult earthling named Clark Kent -- is working on a fishing boat haunted by an unnamed past and once in a while jumping into the water to save a crew from a burning rig with his superhuman strength. It takes nearly an hour for Clark to don the iconic red cape and ""S""-imprinted chest plate which turns out to be not even the midpoint in a story that with its back-and-forths jump cuts and flashbacks and repetitively percussive action sequences seems to have been filmed by an easily distracted child or sentient garden hose. We see Clark being bullied as a child then saving a bus full of his tormentors; we see him confer with his adoptive parents the Kents (beautifully played by Diane Lane and Kevin Costner) who sense theyre in the middle of the ultimate drama of the gifted child. We zip to the Arctic tundra where Daily Planet staffer Lois Lane (Amy Adams) -- now a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter -- is writing about a mysterious discovery beneath the ice. Wait a minute is that Jor-El again brought back in holographic form? Wait how did Clark get to the tundra exactly? Is that a tornado coming our way? I thought we werent in Kansas anymore Dispensing with such pesky bits as smooth transitions and logical chronology Snyder pings and pongs viewers through ""Man of Steel"" his blurry swish pans jittery zooms and blobby close-ups an uneasy fit with 3-D that as in most cases is completely unnecessary. With such a disorienting visual language accompanied by Hans Zimmers turgid over-produced score ""Man of Steel"" is an exceptionally unpleasant viewing experience especially coming on the heels of such snappy superhero movies as ""The Avengers."" Indeed by now its difficult not to see the DNA of previous comic book movies throughout the iconography of this one right down to the way Superman kneels with his fist on the ground Iron Man-style before rocketing into space. Backloading ""Man of Steel"" with three epic confrontations in a row Snyder tries to up the spectacle ante with ever more explosions crashes thermal blasts topological realignments gunfire and mano-a-mano fistfights. But the result is a punishing sense of diminishing returns and a genre that has finally reached the point of mayhem-induced exhaustion. It seems beside the point to assess the performances in such a joyless one-note production Everyone hits their marks and takes their job seriously especially Crowe who utters his often absurd lines with the soft sincerity of a true pro. But even when shes being swept off her feet by a tall dark dreamboat in tights Adams never looks like shes having much fun. The fact that Lois susses out Supermans identity early doesnt bode well for chemistry in future installments. (The closest anyone comes to actually calling Clark Kent ""Superman"" by the way is when Lois starts to say it before being interrupted.) And rest assured there will be future installments Reportedly Snyder and Goyer are already at work on the follow-up to ""Man of Steel"" which with its allegorical nods to adolescent struggles with identity and ungovernable impulses may have gotten the why-so-serious stuff out of the way. ""Man of Steel"" ends on an optimistic note at least with the maddeningly impassive Cavill -- who was so delicious in the TV series ""The Tudors"" -- finally showing a different emotional color than the movies myriad shades of gray. That rare sighting up on screen isnt a bird or a plane Its just a smile. 1/2 PG-13. At area theaters.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 13 2013 642 PM Man of Steel Can America stomach a superhero this saintly? By Dana Stevens Henry Cavill as Superman in Man of Steel Photo by Clay Enos/Warner Bros. After youve seen Man of Steel come back and listen to our Spoiler Special Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. A colleague of mine made the astute observation that superhero blockbusters have something in common with medieval religious art. Both rely on rigidly fixed iconographies drawn from a narrow range of canonical subject matter. The individual creator may vary the style but the terms of the representation are governed by a larger divine or quasi-divine cosmic order hence the endless variations on the Annunciation the descent from the cross the first appearance of the cape and tights the final fistfight atop a skyscraper. Zack Snyders Man of Steel doesnt aim to turn that cosmic order inside out; this is the work of a man of faith a director whose whole career has been predicated on his love for the comic and graphic-novel form. But Snyder (300 Watchmen Sucker Punch) provides an elegantly illuminated retelling of the origin story of that most saintly of superheroes Superman. Supermans saintliness is part of what makes him so hard to pull off in our era of dark brooding morally conflicted superheroes. Like Mary Poppins Kal-El aka Clark Kent is practically perfect in every way honest pure brave compassionate filial. He can easily come off as a goody-two-shoes when not played by someone as endearingly modest and self-evidently human as Christopher Reeve whose hold on the character in the public imagination (or at least mine) has never really let go since Richard Donners 1978 Superman. Advertisement The young British actor Henry Cavill who takes over the role here (it was last played by Brandon Routh in the mopey soon-forgotten Superman Returns) doesnt have Christopher Reeves sparkle--but to be fair its not like he is being directed to generate that kind of radiance. Cavill--a slight beautiful man whose dimpled chin and introspective eyes suggest John Travolta by way of Montgomery Clift--is only one element in what amounts to a vast project of world- and franchise-building. In fact we dont even get a glimpse of the adult Clark (disconcertingly bearded and working under a false name on a fishing ship) until well into the first hour. Until then weve spent most of our time on Krypton the doomed planet from which baby Kal-Els parents Jor-El and Lara (Russell Crowe and Ayelet Zurer) reluctantly agree to launch their newborn in a spaceship. You would think the imminent explosion of your home planet would be enough reason to send your baby into space but Kal has a second threat to contend with the sworn hatred of General Zod (a muted uncomfortable-seeming Michael Shannon) his scientist fathers former ally whos determined to find a planet for the remaining Kryptonians to settle on--even if that involves depopulating someone elses. The early scenes on Krypton contain some fascinating imaginings of alien technology and design. Supermans home planet isnt all dank dripping tunnels and clanking hardware but a place of Art Nouveau-style architecture and spacecraft that recall hovering deer ticks (or in the case of young Kal-Els space pod a vaguely phallic unshelled peanut). But as cool as Krypton looks its hard to get invested in Jor-El and Zods debate about how best to save their beloved planet when we all know its about to be blown to smithereens. Once Kal arrives on Earth--his phallic pod alighting in the cornfield of Smallville Kan. farmers Jonathan and Martha Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane)--the story picks up some speed. Snyder cuts nimbly among timelines as we meet Clark at age 9 age 13 and finally a conspicuously Jesus-referencing age 33 struggling to hide his still-nascent but already impressive superpowers from a world he fears will reject him. As the incidents of unintended life-saving begin to pile up--this is a kid who cant board a school bus that doesnt plunge off a bridge into a river--Clarks path eventually intersects with that of Lois Lane (Amy Adams wonderful as always) a fierce investigative reporter who will stop at nothing to find out the identity of this rumored invincible man. Connoisseurs of the office-romance frisson between Lois and Clark will be disappointed by this movies de-emphasis on the Daily Planet as a workplace; we only visit the newsroom briefly mainly during arguments between Lois and her editor (Laurence Fishburne) who reasonably enough is reluctant to run with even a well-sourced ""flying man from outer space"" scoop. The last hour is devoted almost entirely to the grand-scale destruction of Metropolis as the airborne Superman and Zod slug it out spectacularly over a city thats collapsing on top of its own citizens. Unlike many (too many) similar scenes in recent action films that casually ransack 9/11 for readymade disaster imagery this sequence is crisply edited and imaginatively staged. Snyder excels at creating big punchy images that recall a comic-book spread as when the brawling hero and villain swoosh through the air in convincingly rendered hyperspeed leaving a long slowly fading blur over the skyline. But the awareness of the rapidly ascending body count on the ground below them makes the indulgent length of this final battle hard to stomach. Lois and Clarks first kiss and the mocking banter that ensues are also a bit queasy-making given that the supersmooch literally takes place at the foot of a heap of smoking rubble. If this version of Superman is to have a future--as Warner Brothers seems convinced he will having already green-lit the sequel--I hope Snyder will dial back both the casualty count and the Krypton mythmaking and instead focus on establishing a fictional Earth thats rich enough to be worth saving.

Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide The real war in superhero movieland isnt between good and bad guys; its between Marvel and DC Comics. So far Marvel with Spider-Man Iron Man Thor the Avengers et al. has been winning the tussle. Now DCs ""Man of Steel"" the umpteenth reboot of the ""Superman"" franchise leaps into the fray. Taking a cue from the ""Batman"" series the film is dark and thudding and overlong not surprising since the film was written by ""Dark Knight""s David S. Goyer from a story he concocted with Christoper Nolan who also co-produced. Its also in 3-D to no great effect. (A 2-D version is also in theaters.)Anybody attracted to the Superman of olden days will be alienated by this gargantuan drearfest that pits our hero played a bit too blankly by Henry Cavill against Michael Shannons General Zod a survivor of the planet Kryptons catastrophic extinction. Zod and his minions sport the latest in Kryptonian leatherware while Superman back on Earth takes forever to don his suit and cape.Director Zack Snyder pays lip service to the Superman mythos - Lois Lane (Amy Adams) is here Ma and Pa Kent (Diane Lane and Kevin Costner) Perry White (Laurence Fishburne) and Jor-El (Russell Crowe) - but you get the feeling he would rather have chucked the entire back story not to mention the front story and just delivered up nonstop bashing. Which he sort of does anyway. Recommended The 50 best movies of all time If Superman and Batman team up for a sequel you might want to bring earplugs and night-vision goggles.

Dallas Comic Cons Mark Walters the biggest fanboy of them all By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 629am on Friday Jun. 14 2013 Friday Jun. 14 2013 Friday Jun. 14 2013 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram For its first half Man of Steel is well on its way to superhero-movie greatness.Dark turbulent and not at all campy it casts the young Clark Kent as a perennial outcast a boy trapped between the wishes of his adoptive father who demands he keep his strengths secret; a world that shuns him when he shows any evidence that he is different; and his gnawing desire to be who he really is.Using alienation as a theme is familiar to the comic-book world of course. The ""X-Men"" and the ""Dark Knight"" sagas have trod this territory but its new for the cinematic ""Supermans"" at least to this degree. No surprise then that Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer the men behind the gloomy ""Dark Knight"" movies co-wrote the story and Nolan co-produced.But its director Zack Snyder ( 300 Watchmen the Dawn of the Dead reboot) redeeming himself from the wretched steampunk shenanigans of Sucker Punch who pulls it all together. His hellish vision of the planet Krypton in its end times -- where Jor-El (Russell Crowe) sends his newborn son Kal-El (later known as Clark Kent) into deep space to be raised on Earth -- and Clarks tortured road to manhood are ripe with despair.But then the constraints of being an estimated 225 million film with all the weight of box-office expectations that number brings begin to tie the filmmakers hands in bonds that not even Superman can break.By the end Man of Steel has mutated into just another superhero action movie with explosions galore and city buildings toppling like so many Legos. Lather rinse repeat.Thats too bad because until the point where it turns into a routine exercise like Thor Man of Steel has so much going for it. When we are introduced to the adult Kent (Henry Cavill The Tudors) he lives a loner life not revealing much of anything to anyone -- unless his help is really needed as when some workers have to be rescued from a collapsing rig in the middle of the ocean.But when an alien ship from Krypton is found buried near the Arctic -- and the government as well as Lois Lane (Amy Adams) an investigative reporter for The Daily Planet are trying to figure out what it is -- Kents private life begins to unravel.He is forced to make himself public when his dads nemesis from Krypton General Zod (Michael Shannon) shows up looking for Kal-El. It seems that dear old Dad packed something besides his only son on that ship many years ago; he also sent along the seeds for all future generations of Kryptonians. Long story short The diabolical Zod wants to terraform and repopulate Earth in the image of his dearly departed Krypton.Of course Kal-El aka Clark Kent (cleverly the name ""Superman"" is only hinted at) cant let that happen. And thats when things begin to spiral into the ordinary as the future of Earth hinges on a battle between Zod and his minions and Superman and his newfound government buddies including Col. Nathan Hardy (Christopher Meloni) Gen. Swanwick (Harry Lennix) and scientist Emil Hamilton (Richard Schiff). Man of Steel is loaded with solid performances starting with Cavill who not only has the physical presence of someone with a giant ""S"" on his chest but also brings the right amount of pathos and unease to the part of a man trying to find himself. (Dylan Sprayberry who plays him as a teenager is also quite good.)Kevin Costner and Diane Lane are wonderfully sympathetic as Kal-Els adoptive parents who want to shield their son from the worst the world has to offer but realize they cant keep him hidden away forever. For the always reliable Shannon (a critics favorite in films like Take Shelter) this could be a breakout role while Adams Lois Lane sports a feisty independence.The special effects are impressive -- especially a tornado that sweeps through Clarks Kansas hometown -- but as the climactic battles wear on they become repetitive and more adventurous viewers will feel that a big chance was lost.But in Hollywoods real-world war for the hearts minds and dollars of summer moviegoers Man of Steel will no doubt be the winner.

Clay Enos/Warner Bros. Pictures Man of Steel Director Zack Snyder Genre Action/Adventure Sci-Fi Fantasy Running Time 143 minutes Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence action and destruction and for some language With Henry Cavill Amy Adams Michael Shannon Take heart ye spandex-haters Zack Snyders steroidal yet sensitive Man of Steel is not a superhero film. Full disclosure Over the past two years this reviewer has spent a great deal of time thinking about superheroes in general and Superman in particular. Less than some perhaps but more -- its safe to say -- than most of you reading these words as you debate whether or not to duck out of the heat this weekend to take in Snyders latest summertime smash-em-up. Specifically I wrote a cultural history of Superman that examines which elements of the character have remained constant over the course of his 75-year existence and which have reflected the societal shifts taking place around him. In this context Ive read lots of comics and taken in over 700 hours of Supermans derring-doings on radio television and film. And when I say Man of Steel is not a superhero film Im speaking here of a juggernaut of a genre that many critics have come to disdain as an invasive species a Burmese python thats spent the past 20 years gobbling up indigenous fauna in the Everglades of contemporary cinema. Its a genre ironically enough that Superman himself created with 1978s Superman The Movie the first of many films to map Joseph Campbells heros journey onto a narrative infrastructure that borrowed the sweep of the epic Western the snap of the screwball comedy and the property damage of the disaster film. This 35-year-old formula with modest tweaks has fueled the narrative engines of stinker (Green Lantern) and winner (The Avengers) alike films in which we cheer the doughty hero and hiss the contemptible villain. i This telling of the Superman story leans hard on the tension between the fit-in-at-all-costs imperatives of Kal-Els Kansas upbringing featuring Diane Lane as surrogate mother Martha Kent ... Clay Enos/Warner Bros. Pictures hide caption toggle caption Clay Enos/Warner Bros. Pictures This telling of the Superman story leans hard on the tension between the fit-in-at-all-costs imperatives of Kal-Els Kansas upbringing featuring Diane Lane as surrogate mother Martha Kent ... Clay Enos/Warner Bros. Pictures To understand what sets Man of Steel well apart from previous efforts to deliver Superman to a mass audience its important to keep in mind that the Superman who has shown up in movies and on television to date is only nominally a figure of science fiction. The comics given their limitless special-effects budget can and do eagerly embrace the characters pulpy sci-fi giant-robot-space-alien-fightin roots. But film and television properties like the 78 Superman Lois amp; Clark and Smallville have tended to pivot away from his intergalactic provenance at the first opportunity devoting themselves thereafter to more prosaic earthbound pursuits -- nabbing robbers foiling crooked real-estate schemes and such. Sure the whole ""doomed planet Krypton"" gets lip service early on in each of these iterations but the Superman historically served up by film and television is largely a creature of warm sun-dappled fantasy not chilly gunmetal-gray science. That ends here. Snyders Man of Steel emphatically doubles down on the myriad science-fiction aspects that come hard-wired into the Superman myth. The result perhaps inevitably owes more to noisy technophilic alien-invasion fare like Transformers and Battleship than to the lyric romanticism of Richard Donners Superman films or Bryan Singers 2006 Superman Returns. i ... and the fallout from the long-ago space-opera insurrection that landed Kryptons General Zod (Michael Shannon right with Antje Traue) and his rebels in the Phantom Zone. Warner Bros. Pictures hide caption toggle caption Warner Bros. Pictures ... and the fallout from the long-ago space-opera insurrection that landed Kryptons General Zod (Michael Shannon right with Antje Traue) and his rebels in the Phantom Zone. Warner Bros. Pictures Thats not necessarily a bad thing -- not if what youre looking for in a summer blockbuster is for blocks to get well and truly busted as they do here with grim relish. Especially if you came out of Singers sweetly melancholic but overly dutiful Superman film wishing the guy could have punched more things more often. And harder. Put it this way Man of Steel is the kind of movie in which such bombastic cries as ""SURRENDER THE CODEX"" and ""RELEASE THE WORLD ENGINE"" occur with unabashed metronomic regularity. But Snyder doesnt allow his actors or his film to luxuriate in the soap-operatic camp of such moments preferring to keep things moving at a nimble trot. That might be the influence of producer Christopher Nolan and screenwriter David S. Goyer whose Dark Knight trilogy similarly eschewed humor for spectacle. There are moments of lightness in Man of Steel as when our hero attempts to take to the air for the first time (the ride is more than a little rocky) and times where the film seems to understand the essential hopefulness that makes up the characters core. ""You can save [them]"" Jor-El (Russell Crowe) assures Superman (Henry Cavill) at a key juncture; ""you can save them all."" Cavill is particularly good here lending the compassionate moral center of Superman a wry specificity that keeps it from seeming bland. And Amy Adams savvy matter-of-fact Lois Lane is given more to do than many Loises before her. Like Superman Returns Man of Steel does reach back to Donners seminal 1978 film. But Superman Returns did so to cannibalize that pictures tone and design aesthetic while Man of Steel simply borrows its driving conflict. The subtext of Superman The Movies climax found the Man of Steel choosing between his Kryptonian heritage and his adopted world. In Snyder and Goyers hands that subtext is made the explicit and oft-spoken text. (Indeed Goyers dialogue remains as regrettably blunt an instrument as it was in the Dark Knight films; characters can be counted upon to tell us exactly what they are thinking the very moment they think it.) Man of Steel does locate and deliver on the abiding appeal of Superman an unguarded irony-free idealism plus dazzling displays of power wrapped up in the heartening notion that a man who could do anything he chooses to look out for us. What it fails to supply much of -- surprisingly it must be said -- is fun. This is serious business Snyder seems always to be saying. This is badass. And given the sheer logistical size of the spectacle on display its a position thats hard to argue with. And yet. The film ends with an epic frenetically violent superhero battle of a scope often seen in the comics but never heretofore on any screen. Figures soar through the air crash into buildings and fly away. Yet Snyders camera doesnt follow them. Over and over again he lingers on a damaged skyscraper to show it crumbling languidly into rubble and rebar as screaming citizens flee in terror. This feels nothing like watching a man in a Godzilla suit trample a cardboard Tokyo or seeing flying saucers vaporize an Epcot Village of tourist landmarks in Independence Day. It feels sour and cynical like an attempt to elicit visceral reactions by siphoning emotive force from our communal memories of a very real horror. Yes yes Weve seen New York get destroyed often since Sept. 11 most recently in The Avengers. But in that film the violence ratchets steadily up to a literally fantastic climax involving giant mechanical space eels. Man of Steels violence doesnt escalate; it simply tediously iterates. We keep waiting to thrill to exult to cheer our hero on. When the lights come up were still waiting.

"Man of Steel | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; man-of-steel ) Man of Steel (United States 2013) June 13 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli Note There is a ""spoiler"" in passing for Star Trek into Darkness. Not a big thing if youve seen the movie (or even if you havent) but dont say you havent been warned. I also refer in vague terms to the ending of this film. Khan has returned. So has Zod. Robocop is on the way. For 80s films its back to the future. How long until Marty McFly takes a detour down Remake Road or along Reboot Lane? Man of Steel represents the latest attempt by Warner Brothers to revive a Superman franchise that since its stunning 1978 revival has been abominably treated for about 30 years (ever since Richard Donner was unceremoniously fired from Superman II). This movie certainly looks and feels a lot different than any of its predecessors and thats not just because of the crappy 3-D. Its more of a science fiction/fantasy adventure than a superhero movie. In a way thats good because it doesnt come across like a tired retread of every origin story weve ever seen. On the other hand its not good because the sci-fi feel has been overly influenced by the likes of Independence Day and Transformers. Thats right blow everything up real good Pyrotechnics Special Effects CGI up the wazoo For those who crave cinematic mayhem Man of Steel is right up your alley (and it will make a ton of money). But something important has been lost along the way heart. This is a cold sterile motion picture. The characters are so thinly drawn that its tough to get much feel for them. And one senses that director Zack Snyder is less interested in Superman than he is in the orgy of destruction he gets to rain down on Metropolis. Somewhere Roland Emmerich and Michael Bay are smiling. Man of Steel opens with the obligatory introductory Krypton sequence. Its some of the best material the movie has to offer; the dying planet is visually impressive and the acting by Russell Crowe as Jor-El is some of the best work the actor has provided in a long time. Gone is the flat stilted interpretation offered by Marlon Brando sleepwalking his way through the role on the way to a fat paycheck. Crowes Jor-El is heroic and charismatic. With Krypton nearing its end he places his little boy into a spacecraft and sends him to Earth. Meanwhile the hard-ass General Zod (Michael Shannon in full scenery-chewing mode) attempts a coup fails and is sentenced to spend some time in The Phantom Zone for his troubles. The first time we meet Clark Kent (Henry Cavill) hes trying out for The Deadliest Catch. After saving some men on a doomed oil rig Clark floats around in the water experiencing convenient flashbacks to his childhood living in Kansas with Ma and Pa Kent (Diane Lane and Kevin Costner). Once these are done he heads north and after paying homage to the diner scene in Superman II reaches the Fortress of Solitude which is actually a spaceship buried under arctic ice. In that frozen wasteland he also meets intrepid reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams) who immediately falls for the big hunk after he saves her life. In the spaceship Clark meets an avatar of his dad and gets his costume. Its around this time that Zod and his followers freed from The Phantom Zone reach Earth and Superman must choose between continuing to live anonymously or taking a front seat as the planets defender. Unlike Zod in Superman II who came to conquer this Zod comes to destroy. Man of Steel is first and foremost a great spectacle. The effects work is first rate and the action sequences of which there are many are delivered with a kinetic punch. The tone is dour - humor is at a premium and on those rare occasions when its there the delivery is decidedly low-key. The movie wants desperately to be taken seriously and viewed as something more than a comic book film. Perhaps in the end thats one reason why Man of Steel rarely feels heroic and never truly soars. Sure Superman eventually wins but at the cost of thousands of lives (were not given a specific body count but it has to be very high). Christopher Nolans influence will be hotly debated especially since the producer has been coy about the full extent of his involvement in the final product stating only that ""its Zack Synders film."" Indeed Man of Steel is closer to Watchmen than Batman Begins in terms of its look and feel. Its a style over substance thing spectacle over heart. Snyder never ceases to amaze visually but one could make a compelling case that he ""misses"" what defines Supermans uniqueness. It makes sense for Batman to live in the dark but Superman has always been a figure of light and truth. Thats one reason hes a difficult movie subject because theres no ambiguity about who he is and what he represents and theres something about the darkness that pervades Man of Steel that feels wrong for the character. The choice of Henry Cavill to don the cape is inspired; Cavill is easily the most accomplished actor thus far to fill the role and while no one will ever fully eclipse what Christopher Reeve brought to the screen Cavill uses Man of Steel as an opportunity to lay the foundation for what could be a long and memorable run. He combines the matinee appeal of Reeve and Brandon Routh with a stronger resume although truth be told the screenplay underuses his range. The main requirement for Cavill is to look the part. As a cookie cutter supervillain Michael Shannon does a good job overacting. He snarls and yells and exudes menace. He rants and does all sorts of nasty things. In the end however its the name ""Zod"" that puts Shannon at a disadvantage because it forces him to exist in the long shadow of Terence Stamp. Stamps Zod is arguably one of the twenty most memorable movie bad guys and Shannon doesnt touch him. The other casting miscalculation is Amy Adams as Lois Lane. The part doesnt fit. On the other hand there are some great choices although most of them are sadly underused. Laurence Fishburne makes a terrific Perry White although he has very little screen time. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane are great as Clarks Earth parents although Costner in particular deserves more screen time. Man of Steel delivers forcefully on its promise to take Superman in a different direction. Perhaps thats a good idea; after all Richard Donner (with an assist from Richard Lester) has done the ""traditional"" Superman as well as it can be done. But a lot is missing and the most telling absence is the element that makes Superman more the hero of his own story rather than the pawn of special effects. This is a less promising opening act than Batman Begins because it mines so little new territory. Remakes like Man of Steel are about intangibles like tone and style and how well the soul of the central conceit has been maintained. Snyder succeeds in making this movie sufficiently different to justify its existence. The open question is whether this Superman can spearhead a franchise that aspires to greatness or whether this new ""dark vision"" is merely window dressing.

Warner Bros. Pictures By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com June 13 2013 131 p.m. ET ""Man of Steel"" certainly does take itself seriously as an origin story. It starts with a pounding heartbeat followed by you-know-who emerging from his mothers womb on the planet Krypton. ( Russell Crowe and Ayelet Zurer are the babys parents.) That auspicious event is we are told Kryptons first natural birth in centuries. On our planet however the story proves to be a miscarriage if not quite an abortion. Heres one more studio extravaganza brought down by numbing action and an addiction to generic digital effects. (I chose to see the 2-D version so I cant blame the third dimension.) Related What is your earliest Superman memory? With Man of Steel opening on Friday WSJs Marshall Crook takes a look back at the history of Superman in media. Its a huge disappointment since the buildup to the action is so promising albeit joyless. The promise lies partly in Alex McDowells elegant production design which suggests that Kryptons civilization was influenced by cross-cosmos currents of Gothic and Gaudi but mainly in the darkly revisionist premise. We will not the long prelude makes clear be seeing Superman as yesteryears sturdy superhero in tights; hes to be taken more seriously than that. We wont even be seeing this iteration of Kal-El as Superman a name that goes unspoken throughout though it almost escapes the lips of Amy Adamss Lois Lane. Then what does that capital S on his chest stand for? It isnt an S at all David S. Goyers script reveals slyly but a Kryptonic character that means ""hope""--i.e. hope for mankind. The steely man of the title liberated from yesteryears external underwear and played with unalloyed gravity by Henry Cavill has come to us with godlike powers. Therefore the movie which was directed by Zack Snyder raises the question of whether well be smart enough to receive such a one with open arms. Thats a fair question even if the visual parallels between Kal-El and Christ are insisted on overmuch. And theres plenty to enjoy in the drama of the hero coming to grips with those powers as a confused youngster in the heartland ( Kevin Costner and Diane Lane are his adoptive parents); meeting Lois who learns quickly for once the truth of his identity; and preparing for the struggle against the evil General Zod (Michael Shannon) who arrives from Krypton with a gang of baddies and extremely bad intentions. Yet hope springs ephemeral in this production. First off theres the problem of casting in the central role. ""I can do things that others cant"" Kal-El tells the grievously injured Lois as he cauterizes her wound with sizzling eyebeams. Its tempting to think that another actor might have done things Mr. Cavill cant but theres no way of knowing given Mr. Snyders stiff direction and the generally turgid dialogue. (Lots of talk about trust leaps of faith and initiating the phantom drive.) Theres also the issue of Mr. Crowes Jor-El who keeps materializing with bizarre frequency as his sons holographic spirit guide and real-time strategist never mind that the old man is long dead. Marlon Brandos Jor-El returned too but only in obvious outtakes. Eventually though what seals the movies doom--as inventive entertainment though perhaps not as a commercial venture--is its surrender to the lower power of coarsegrained action and computer-generated images of inexplicable banality. Its ""Fight Club"" cum sci-fi as Zod and Kal-El duke it out on the streets of Smallville then do it again just like barroom brawlers during an interminable climax set against a background of a Manhattan seized by the usual chaos of fireballs shattering glass flying trucks and toppling towers. ""You know they say its all downhill after the first kiss"" Lois tells her inamorato early on. She doesnt know the meaning of downhill. Watch a clip from the documentary ""20 Feet From Stardom"" which tells the stories of backup singers in the music industry including Michael Jackson backup singer Judith Hill. (Photo/Video The Weinstein Company) 20 Feet From Stardom Lots of filmmakers start with good ideas but dont know how to develop them. Morgan Neville started with a great idea--a feature-length documentary about backup singers--and what do you know turned it into a great movie. Mr. Nevilles documentary has it all--stirring stories about remarkable people and music that not only approaches but now and then achieves the sublime. Its subjects are the opposite of household names unless were referring as the film does to the households of such superstars as Mick Jagger and Stevie Wonder. Theyre on hand along with Sting Bruce Springsteen and Bette Midler to help celebrate the unsung divas who have enriched popular music beyond measure. ENLARGE Jo Lawry Judith Hill and Lisa Fischer Radius TWC ""They bring a world with them"" Mr. Springsteen says. For the most part its a world rooted in gospel an African-American world in which many of the backup-singers-to-be grew up as ministers daughters or projected piercingly beautiful harmonies as members of their church choirs. Sting speaks eloquently of the spiritual component in their work and with specific awe of Lisa Fischer--""I think shes just a freak of nature that Ive never seen before."" Ms. Fischer emerges as the films star. Thats a delicious eventuality for someone who has spent much of her professional life in supporting roles although she wasnt exactly anonymous before Mr. Neville turned on his camera; shes been a prominent part of every Rolling Stones tour since 1989. (To give a sense of her singular gift the filmmaker creates an optical assemblage of Ms. Fischer fourfold singing heavenly vocalese in her very own quartet.) Other singers featured in the film are formidable artists in their own right. They include Merry Clayton Darlene Love (who at the nadir of her life was cleaning houses then managed to restart her career) Claudia Lennear Tata Vega Sheryl Crow Gloria Jones Lynn Mabry and Judith Hill. Some wanted to be stars others had no taste for the limelight. Some succeeded some fell from professional grace. ""Its not a level playing field"" Sting says. ""Its not about fairness."" This movie is about the divine spark the mystery of motivation and the luck of the draw. It comes along at a perfect time when the telling of its story is overdue and when its subjects still in the fullness of their lives can speak and sing for themselves. ENLARGE Seth Rogen and Jay Baruchel Columbia Pictures This Is the End Heres a (partial) list of disclaimers for ""This Is the End"" an erratic pseudo-epic gross-out horror comedy in which Seth Rogen and Jay Baruchel playing versions of themselves crash a party at a fancy Hollywood home owned by James Franco (who plays himself gleefully) then experience a series of seemingly apocalyptic events that in fact signal the end of the world. Watch a clip from ""This Is the End."" While attending a party at James Francos house Seth Rogen Jay Baruchel and many other celebrities (including Jonah Hill Emma Watson and Craig Robinson) are faced with the apocalypse. (Photo/Video Sony) Gross-out barely hints at its level of vulgarity which makes ""South Park"" chaste by comparison. Erratic barely hints at the spasms and spurts of its hit-or-miss aesthetic if you can use such a term by way of describing infantile silliness childish incoherence rampant narcissism or definitive dissoluteness. Heres a crucial claimer though the movie can be outrageously even sensationally funny. And for whatever its worth this monument to low humor and high spirits will likely be a hit of epic proportions. ENLARGE From left James Franco Jonah Hill Craig Robinson Seth Rogen Jay Baruchel and Danny McBrid. Columbia Pictures ""This Is the End"" began as a 2007 short ""Jay and Seth Versus the Apocalypse."" The cast of the current expansion which was written and directed by Evan Goldberg and Mr. Rogen includes Jonah Hill Danny McBride Craig Robinson Michael Cera and Emma Watson who wields a mean ax while fending off what she believes to be zombies. Some of the 107-minute running time is filled if hardly fleshed out by variable riffs on genre cliches and by dirty-word dada. But the pace is quick the good stuff is hilarious the end-of-days effects are impressive in their goofy way and most of the performances are first-rate. These people take their absurdity seriously. ENLARGE DVD Focus Superman II (1980) The 1978 ""Superman"" with Christopher Reeve in the title role was pretty close to perfect as mainstream entertainment but this first of the feature sequels was no slouch either. The director Richard Lester had brought a brilliant comic tone to a pair of films starring the Beatles ""A Hard Days Night"" and ""Help"" He did the same thing here with the help of a sparkling cast that in addition to Mr. Reeve includes Gene Hackman Ned Beatty Margot Kidder Valerie Perrine Jackie Cooper and as the evil General Zod the marvelously imperious Terence Stamp. ENLARGE Whats Love Got to Do With It (1993) Laurence Fishburne plays Ike Turner who figures in ""20 Feet From Stardom""--as a notorious rock star who supposedly saw himself as a pimp. This fine musical biography centers on Angela Bassetts Tina Turner who rose to stardom with Ike suffered terrible abuse at his hands and finally found the wherewithal to break free. The director was Brian Gibson an experienced documentarian at the BBC who also directed ""The Josephine Baker Story"" for HBO. Kate Lanier based the script on ""I Tina My Life Story"" which Ms. Turner wrote with Kurt Loder. ENLARGE Superbad (2007) Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg wrote this classic gross-out comedy that evokes male friendship in all its richness and complexity. Seth (Jonah Hill) and Evan (Michael Cera) are lifelong boon companions and state-of-the-art nerds who are about to graduate from high school and go their separate ways. An unexpected invitation to a party at the house of cool girl Jules ( Emma Stone) gets Seth and Evan fantasizing--maybe theyll get drunk maybe theyll get lucky--and sets off a chain of events that tests their alcohol tolerance and their relationship. The director was Greg Mottola.

How about Planet Sex Organ? Slideshow In Man of Steel the same old same old Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon More about Man of Steel >> In the long loud prologue of the mega-disappointing Man of Steel director Zack Snyder and his crew reimagine Supermans birth orb as a kind of Freudian dreamscape of phalluses and vulvas. Giant bulbous rocket ships stand erect. Hovering pods pulsate pudendally. A ""genesis chamber"" beckons. Ancient runes look like spermatozoa run amok. I could go on but Im too excited. (But H.R. Giger the Swiss artist behind the Alien designs should take a look - and then call his lawyer.) And so after much huffing and puffing and angry words between Supeys dad Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and Kryptons military madman General Zod (Michael Shannon) the newborn Kal-El is tucked into a spaceship for his trip across the galaxies. Destination Earth. ""You will give the people an ideal to strive towards"" says Jor-El bidding a noble adieu to his tiny tot just before Krypton goes kaboom. (Kryptonians have spent their planets resources bringing on an environmental apocalypse.) Once the movie and its hero land on terra firma Man of Steel swaps out the sexual imagery for some blatant religious symbolism. To be sure the Superman myth is rife with biblical allusions but is this really necessary - to show a troubled Clark Kent (Henry Cavill) wandering into a church seeking counsel from a priest with the stained-glass image of Christ looming large behind him? ""Take a leap of faith first"" the cleric tells Clark. ""The trust part comes later."" The best bits of Man of Steel come when the young E.T. - adopted by Kansas farm couple Jonathan and Martha Kent (a determinedly Midwestern Kevin Costner and Diane Lane) - struggles to come to terms with his otherworldly powers which he has been warned to keep secret lest the entire world has a freak-out. Cooper Timberline and Dylan Sprayberry play the grade-school and teenage Kryptonian with convincing angst. But what do you do when the school bus youre on goes over a bridge into the river? Let your classmates drown? And then the grown-up Clark begins his circuitous journey to Metropolis via Alaska where he sports a manly beard and works on a crab boat and then on an arctic dig where he meets ace reporter Lois Lane (a plucky Amy Adams). Something or someone is buried deep in a glacier puzzling the scientists and G-men. Could it be General Zod and his posse here to remake Earth as the new Krypton? Cavill big and handsome with soulful eyes displays more of a Supey vibe than Brandon Routh managed in Bryan Singers 2006 reboot Superman Returns but the English actor gets little occasion to bring any kind of humor to his role. This man of steel is seriously metallic. Christopher Reeve of the 70s-80s Superman quartet remains the most successful and memorable movie incarnation. When comic book legends Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster dreamed up Superman for Action Comics 1 published 75 years ago this month he was the first of a new breed of caped crusaders - high-flying heroes with tights and alter egos. Hordes of other men and women - Batman Captain America Wonder Woman - followed down the decades. Whats particularly disheartening about Man of Steel is that its heros originality - Supermans primacy - has been forsaken for an excess of high-end generic effects. At least an hour of Man of Steels excessive running time is devoted to the sort of crash-and-burn slamming-into-skyscrapers CG fight scenes that weve already seen in The Avengers and Dark Knight Iron Man and Spider-Man. Man of Steel is just the same old same old. Man of Steel  (Out of four stars) Directed by Zack Snyder. With Henry Cavill Michael Shannon Amy Adams Kevin Costner Diane Lane and Russell Crowe.

So whys he such a gloomy Gus? June 17 2013 -- 120pm Video (4913)  Neal Justin TV critic and Colin Covert film critic talk about Man of Steel. The new highly-anticipated Superman film produced by Christopher Nolan is scheduled to be play in theaters starting Thursday. Neil Justin Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Colin Covert colincovert Maybe Im spoiled. After the lively creative ""Avengers"" ""Captain America"" ""Iron Man"" ""X-Men"" and ""Dark Knight"" films ""Man of Steel"" feels like a second-rate take on a first-tier superhero. As a ""first contact"" science-fiction drama about an alien adapting to life among humans its OK. As a Superman movie it never takes flight. Director Zack Snyder producer Christopher Nolan and screenwriter David S. Goyer deliver an earnest (oh so earnest) effort to reinvent the Big Blue Boy Scout whose apple-pie moral purity makes him tough to dramatize. Its a largely misguided struggle fixing nonexistent problems and creating new flaws in the process. As the years roll on the mischievous Richard Donner Superman films look better all the time. Following the gothic Nolan template ""Man of Steel"" turns young Clark Kent into an angst-riddled hero-in-waiting and makes the adult Clark a Wolverine-like Canadian lone wolf. The pop-art colors of his costume have been dulled to shades that Bruce Wayne would find acceptable. Crucially in the heat of the climactic battle they have Superman do the one thing he would never do. Its one thing to shrug off needless layers of comic-book mythology but you shouldnt betray the characters core. The opening chapter on barren Krypton is imaginative and visually powerful. Its a world of dinosaur-like livestock giant dragonfly steeds spaceships modeled on tripod citrus juicers and talkative floating silver personal assistants that re-form their faceplates like giant Pin Art screens. Russell Crowe is authoritative as wise Jor-El who commits heresy with his plan to export his infant son to a distant green planet where he will be ""like a god."" Goyers script pounds this religious motif like a tambourine while Snyder films his hero in a procession of crucifixion poses. Amid the planetary collapse Jors old comrade Gen. Zod (a fully committed Michael Shannon) stages a coup. Why he would seize a ruined world is not an issue we are encouraged to ponder. Nor is his fate when Jor foils the plot. Zod and company are banished to the Forbidden Zone thus preserving them while Krypton faces extinction. Id leave the rebels behind on Krypton and send everyone else to the Zone. Whatever. Different planets different rules. Clay Enos Warner Bros. Henry Cavill as Superman in ""Man of Steel."" The films Earthly look is a mix of Norman Rockwell Americana and Terrence Malick poetic naturalism washed with chilly gray light and deep shadow. The color temperature is so wintry its tough to understand how the ever-present Kansas corn survives. The actors playing sad young Clark are excellent capturing the panic that overwhelms him before he masters his powers. Images of his grade-school classmates viewed through X-ray vision are genuinely creepy. Luckily he has sturdy adoptive parents. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane radiate heartland wholesomeness as the Smallville couple who take in the undocumented alien and shape his sense of right and wrong. Their scenes are suffused with honest unforced emotion as they deal with their sons unanswerable questions and unimaginable potential. Jor-El who does not entirely disappear when Krypton disintegrates counsels Kal-El on his mission to help fallen mankind rediscover its humanity and defeat the freed vengeful Zod. ""You can save them all"" says Jor who is a little fixated on his sons success. ""The Drama of the Gifted Child"" indeed. As the adult Clark Henry Cavill balances a difficult role on his broad shoulders. Hes physically perfect for the role a barrel-chested bright-eyed strong-jawed specimen of almost extraterrestrial perfection. What he is not is fun. By my count he smiles twice in 21/2 hours. Forget heat vision Cavills grin could melt an icecap. Why not let him lighten up a little? The nascent romance between the newcomer and the completely confident and empowered Lois Lane (Amy Adams) feels forced. When they kiss its not because personal magnetism has drawn them together. Its because theres only five minutes left until the movie ends. The requisite lengthy but unimaginative Kal vs. Zod brawl adds little to the existing catalog of superhero mayhem porn. It reduces Metropolis to a junk heap. ""Man of Steel"" doesnt do quite as much damage to the 75-year-old hero but next time out I hope his lighter spirits are allowed to soar. Colin Covert has covered films for the Star Tribune for 20 years interviewing Peter Jackson Kate Winslet Steven Spielberg Cate Blanchett Quentin Tarantino Neil Gaiman and John Travolta to name a few. Colins job as a film critic consists mostly of thinking up synonyms for ""mediocre."" He still gets a thrill when the lights dim and all too often a bigger thrill when they come on again.

"Man of Steel (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Man of Steel (PG-13) Director Zack Snyder delivers the visual flash but little else in this disappointing reinvention of Superman. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com6/13/2013 Editor rating 2 What went wrong with Man of Steel? The early teasers promised Terrence Malick. The finished film is more Michael Bay. Henry Cavill as Kal-El a fugitive from a dead planet who gets god-like powers from our sun is easily the best actor to ever play the role pensive and thoughtful in spots furious and heroic in others. Theres a lot going on behind his eyes. In smaller roles Russell Crowe fares better than Marlon Brando did as Jor-El who can communicate with his son from beyond the grave and Michael Shannon seems like the perfect maniac to play General Zod a power-mad despot who shares Kal-Els powers. They bring some much needed humanity to this cold machine of a movie that constantly tries to wow you perhaps a little too strenuously. Director Zack Snyder (Watchmen 300) probably mindful of the criticisms that greeted 2006s Superman Returns for its lack of action gives you one enormous scene after another (among the best the rescue of the workers on a burning oil rig). Snyder also brings neat touches no filmmaker had ever thought of such as showing us points of view of Kal-Els X-ray vision (he cant ever turn it off) and reminding us of some ingenious uses for the laser beams he can shoot from his eyes. His flight-training lessons are amusing and Snyder doesnt even rely on that old standby Kryptonite the only substance that can harm our hero. Barely anyone in the movie even calls him Superman. But theres a major problem Man of Steel cannot leap over in a single bound or even three David S. Goyers script which he wrote with input from producer Christopher Nolan and decided to alternate between the past (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane raising their adopted son in picturesque Smallville) and Zods increasingly complicated (and not exactly logical) plan to wreak havoc on mankind. The back and forth kills the momentum of the movie You get giant special-effects sequences every 20 minutes and astounding as they are they become routine. The movie doesnt build It feels stitched together by patches of uninteresting dialogue. Amy Adams does her best as Lois Lane the tenacious reporter who never stops digging for a story but she neither looks the part nor does more than spout exposition (Adams is also a redhead and Lane has always been a brunette; the change is akin to making Superman blond). For all the multitude of swirling plotlines Man of Steel starts feeling like just another generic superhero movie -- the exact opposite of the radical and unique stamp Nolan placed on the Dark Knight trilogy. By the time of the big showdown a 30-minute sequence in which Superman and Zod topple buildings in Metropolis and presumably kill thousands of people (albeit accidentally) all you can notice is how all the supporting characters (including Adams Laurence Fishburne and Christopher Meloni) have been reduced to cutaway shots of people cowering in fear. At least The Avengers gave you plenty of characters Man of Steel is an awfully lonely movie. For all the criticism Bryan Singer received for Superman Returns -- and the movie did suffer from the lack of a good villain -- that film was heartfelt and thoughtful and got inside the mind of a character cursed to forever be a stranger in a strange land. You felt his melancholy. In Man of Steel all you feel are your seats rumbling from the Dolby Digital sound and a vague bit of nausea (the movie is in 3D) thanks to that zooming swooping camera. Snyder is a great visualist but he doesnt know how to make a story flow The movie feels like youre turning pages in a book - a three-year-olds picture book. Man of Steel looks sensational and will no doubt pack theaters but movies this big and ambitious should leave you with something more substantial than ""That was cool.""

The Associated Press This film publicity image released by Warner Bros. Pictures shows Henry Cavill as Superman in ""Man of Steel."" (AP Photo/Warner Bros. Pictures Clay Enos) This looks like a job for Truth Man.If ""Man of Steel"" had crash-landed in theaters with a title like ""After Earth 2 The Rise of Jaden"" we would call it what it is a soulless overblown bore. But because this desecration is disguised as a Superman movie sheepish customers will hesitate to say that the emperor of action heroes has no clothes.Instead theyll say he has new ones. The most obvious kick in the pants from this reboot is that Supermans tri-colored costume has been replaced by an almost-black body suit of militaristic mesh. It hugs the bulges of British pretty boy Henry Cavill who avoids recognizable human emotions as if they were Kryptonite.Of course Superman isnt actually human but we all know from 75 years of pop culture that he was raised by Ma and Pa Kent in a farming community called Smallville Kan. before moving to Metropolis to do good deeds. Yet this misbegotten movie focuses on a feud with a Kryptonian refugee named General Zod (Michael Shannon) whose army of fembots follow the future Superman from their doomed planet to Earth to extract his species-saving DNA.While dwelling on daddy issues (in the forms of Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner) this overextended origin story jettisons almost everything we love about the Superman legend. Do we get to meet mild-mannered reporter Clark Kent? Not quite. Is there romantic chemistry between prize-winning journalist Lois Lane (Amy Adams utterly wasted) and the mysterious lightning rod she dubs Superman? Not much. Is the movie fun to look at? Not even with 3-D vision. The costumes and sets look like rejected designs for ""Dune"" collectibles. Instead of the primary colors from the classic comic books the dominant hue is pewter.As he proved in movies such as ""300"" ""The Watchmen"" and ""Sucker Punch"" director Zack Snyder is a technocrat who doesnt know a thing about people. Working from a wooden script by ""Batman""-franchise freeloader David S. Goyer Snyder somehow makes it even stiffer. Every opportunity for humor compassion or plausible responses to otherworldly phenomena is buried beneath product placements and CGI special effects. ""Man of Steel"" is just another summer movie about aliens toppling skyscrapers -- and our supposed hero does little to stop it. The collateral deaths that he not only ignores but possibly causes while fist-fighting with Zod could number in the thousands. Yet as the decimated city smolders this British imitation of Superman finds time to snog with Lois -- and then he weakly pleads with the villain not to destroy a room full of people with a beam of light.He should have pleaded with the beam-wielding hack Snyder a villain of cosmic proportions.When ""Man of Steel""  One and a half stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 223  Content Intense sequences of sci-fi violence action and destruction and some strong language Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

Comments (2) click to enlarge Man of Steel Video Rated PG-13  143 minutes  2013 Superman returns in a complete reboot only seven years after Bryan Singers tedious Superman Returns. Warner Bros. decided that one didnt merit a sequel and instead started over with Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer who wrote the ""Dark Knight"" trilogy; their screenplay is a big improvement over the previous one mainly because theyve created a satisfying arc between the heros genesis story (just before his native Krypton explodes his father fires him off to earth in a rocket) and the big battle at the end (the wicked General Zod a fellow survivor of Krypton arrives on earth 30 years later hoping to colonize the planet). Zack Snyder (300) directed; with Michael Shannon (monochromatic as the snarling Zod) Amy Adams (as Lois Lane) Kevin Costner and Diane Lane (as the homespun Kents) and Henry Cavill (dully handsome as Clark Kent/Superman which is all the role requires).

(I guess the ""Superman Returns"" reboot from 2006 really didnt take.) To be fair ""Man of Steel"" has an idea behind it and superior production design which puts it ahead of a whole bunch of Hollywood movies. Superman aficionados will no doubt find it suitably canonical with an extended prologue set on the dying planet of Krypton even if Supermans classic uniform is now made of that inevitable nylon-mesh athletic fiber that supposed to suggest contemporary coolness (if youre 12 years old and really into LeBron James).But despite looking feeling and (especially) sounding expensive - this is one of the loudest summer spectacles of recent years - ""Man of Steel"" is second-tier and third-generation Chris Nolan-flavored neo-superhero material. Nolan chose not to direct this film but co-wrote the original story with David S. Goyer (who wrote the final screenplay) and is one of the producers. I feel at least some compassion for Snyder a director of immense ambition and technical skill whose work has yielded intriguingly mixed results in ""Sucker Punch"" ""Watchmen"" ""300"" and other movies. Here he finds himself in the impossible position of trying to put his own stamp on material that feels a lot like ""Dark Knight Lite"" while avoiding the impression of serving as Nolans surrogate or transcriber.Unfortunately he cant pull it off and ""Man of Steel"" has all the Nolan-esque tics you expect from the Leni Riefenstahl heroic extreme close-ups to the oversize muscles and proto-fascist (or flat-out fascist) iconography to the creepy-looking technology ripped off from ""Alien"" to the assaultive and incoherent action sequences that go on so long you yearn for death or at least for deafness. In the best moments of the ""Dark Knight"" trilogy Nolan made you feel like the movies captured a certain gloomy or cynical insight into human nature and in particular into the cycles of corruption and delusion that drive human politics. But while Batman is an isolated and peculiar rich man with human failings Superman is a godlike being from another galaxy created to inhabit the infantile fantasy lives of young children. Any attempt to invest him with philosophical depth risks becoming moronic and/or offensive almost immediately.Indeed it feels as if the idea for ""Man of Steel"" emerged from a sultry afternoon meeting when Goyer and Nolan played air hockey and drank Mountain Dew for hours until one of them said ""Hey Superman Didnt Nietzsche write a book about him?"" When it intermittently pretends to be about something ""Man of Steel"" tries to split the difference between the old DC Comics or TV serial Superman a square-jawed dude devoted to ""truth justice and the American way"" and the entirely different Nietzschean concept of the Ubermensch which even scholars of philosophy have a tough time pinning down. Superman is beyond good and evil but chooses the ideology of Americanism out of the infinite options available to him in order to placate the idiotic sheeple of our planet. Or something like that.Back on Krypton before the whole place blows up Supermans dad Jor-El (a suitably grave and hirsute Russell Crowe) makes clear that he understands his infant son will be received as a god by the lesser beings of Earth and will form a kind of mystical bridge between his own people and ours. (I hadnt noticed until now how much the Superman story resembles Mormon theology or Scientology.) Once the baby Kal-El lands in Kansas and becomes Clark Kent his human dad (Kevin Costner with hitched-up jeans and a bad haircut) keeps telling him that he will be a singular figure in human history but that he needs to keep his remarkable gifts hidden until he can master his own will and understand his own mission. I dont dispute that you can find stuff like this in previous iterations of the Superman story but Goyer and Nolan are clearly drawing on Nietzsches idea of the superman or ""overman"" as a transcendent transformative figure who will create a new set of values in the moral vacuum left behind by the death of God. You Might Also Like Bet you didnt think we were going there in a review of a summer popcorn movie did you? Yet at the same time theres a profound confusion at work in ""Man of Steel"" because Snyder Goyer and Nolan also want to identify Superman with the last transformative otherworldly dude to put in an appearance here 2000 or so years ago. In this telling Clark bums around for most of his young adulthood working odd jobs and stuff (though I guess hes not actually a carpenter) before mastering his powers and unveiling the Superman persona at age 33 a fact mentioned several times. When the Kryptonian renegade General Zod (Michael Shannon enjoyable as ever with a goatee and a Roman-emperor haircut) shows up on Earth and demands the surrender of Kal-El the adult Clark (Henry Cavill) goes to visit a priest or minister and tells him about his true identity. Just in case we havent gotten any of this so far cinematographer Amir Mokri frames Cavill before a stained-glass window depicting You Know Who I think preaching the Sermon on the Mount. Christian iconography is nothing new in the Superman universe either - the Christopher Reeve movies were loaded with it - but my real point is that the organizing principle of ""Man of Steel"" seems to be a little bit of this and then a little bit of that religion philosophy blah blah blah and when things start to get dull lets pump up the volume and fling some locomotives around. Following the lead of ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" and other recent summer spectacles Snyder depicts an apocalyptic battle between Superman and Zod that inflicts planetary devastation on a scale hundreds of times larger than 9/11 with no real acknowledgment of death or suffering or moral consequences that might endanger the PG-13 rating.Crowe Costner and the diabolical Shannon (who seems to be channeling his own version of the Ricardo Montalban role in ""Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan"") are by far the best things about the movie managing to seem like recognizable humanoid types in this arid landscape. I also enjoyed Diane Lane as Clarks Kansas mom even if the role mainly involves beaming adoringly at her marvelous son. As Superman and Clark Kent Cavill is a big handsome and undeniably impressive slab of beef genial enough but with no visible personality. Amy Adams one of the best character actresses in American movies cant do much with intrepid reporter Lois Lane perhaps the most boring of all boring female characters in the boy-centric world of comic books. (German actress Antje Traue is far more memorable as General Zods smoldering and sinister gal sidekick.) But all these people pale before the impressive monumental and supremely empty effects along with the general mood of forced-march exhaustion and pointless effort. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

RELATED NEWS Interview Henry Cavill Superheroes and their origins Top 10 superhero movies of all time Hotlist The villains of Man of Steel By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com. Fri Jun 14 2013 1142 AM The problem with Superman has always been his simplicity. Truth justice and the American way personified in a superbeing immune to all of what Earth has to throw at him makes for a rather boring guy. A plane is crashing? Just fly over and grab it using super strength to land it safely. Director Zack Snyder and producer and co-screenwriter Christopher Nolan who directed the ""Dark Knight"" trilogy have done an admirable job of making the Superman story more complex in ""Man of Steel."" By focusing on his origin they are able to mine feelings of alienation and confusion for inner conflict. So thats one problem solved. But once youve got a conflicted man of steel going what do you do with him? That solution proves a little trickier. It doesnt derail ""Man of Steel"" but too often particularly as the film builds (too slowly) toward its climax Snyder relies on ear-shattering action pieces. If you like your summer-movie explosions huge ""Man of Steel"" delivers. But it seems as if it might have delivered even more than a glorious noise. First of course Kal-El as he is known on his native planet Krypton has to get to Earth. He is an infant on Krypton as the story begins. This will be familiar to fans of the comic. Jor-El (Russell Crowe) Kryptons greatest scientist has warned everyone that the planet is unstable and will explode dooming the planet and its civilization. For Jor-El its a desperate tragedy. For General Zod (Michael Shannon) Kryptons military leader its an opportunity. He stages a coup and wants Jor-Els help but it is not forthcoming. Instead Jor-El places his infant son Kal-El in a spaceship and launches him toward Earth. Snyder is patient in his telling of all this spending a surprising amount of time on Krypton. Once the story gets to Earth he doesnt tell the story chronologically. Instead he plays with time with the adult Kal-El now known as Clark Kent (Henry Cavill) a loner and wanderer remembering parts of his childhood as he tries to find a place to fit in. Of course when you have superstrength X-ray vision heat vision and more fitting in isnt always easy. Clark was raised by good Midwestern parents Jonathan and Martha Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane) but hes also unable to ignore how out of place he is on Earth. Its a satisfying dilemma; Jonathan has told Clark the world might not be ready for him not yet. When will it be? Soon enough. Meanwhile the government discovers a strange vessel buried in ice. Intrepid reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams) is hot on the story -- here shes also a Pulitzer Prize winner -- and eventually hot for Clark. Clark also winds up at the ship where he will learn about his past and take the first steps -- and flights -- toward his future with Lois dogging the story and Clark along the way. We havent heard the last from Zod as you might expect which forces Clarks hand. Thats where things start to get a little iffy. Up to this point we have seen Clark try to figure out what his role on this planet is. He has a great many gifts but in what way should he use them? Should he use them? Once the answer to that question becomes clear the movie becomes more of a straightforward superhero-action flick albeit one with tremendous special effects. The action really is spectacular. Cavill is a sufficiently brooding sort and he looks good doing it. (There is a funny joke about it in fact.) Shannon is a great intense actor and nothing here changes that opinion. Adams is also good though shes a little hamstrung by Lois always being a cliched tough reporter. Some of the best moments belong to Crowe whose passion for his civilization and his family sets the story in motion. Origin stories are notoriously difficult to pull off in superhero films. We want to skip past the making-of bit to get to the hero we know to see him in action. Yet in ""Man of Steel"" the origin aspects are the best parts of the movie. How alone and alienating must it be to learn youre the last of your kind (as far as you know)? And then to learn that you are the only hope to help another civilization survive? That is what is interesting about ""Man of Steel."" Is it possible to make what comes after that as intriguing as the getting there? As the end of the movie makes clear were likely to have plenty of sequels in which to find out. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

Zack Snyders dark and moody retelling of the Superman myth combines big action with grand themes By Richard Corliss June 12 2013 Share Read Later Send to Kindle Clay Enos / Warner Bros. Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture Being Superman was so cool; thats what decades of comics-reading boys thought. Outracing a locomotive bending steel like licorice leaping tall buildings flying around saving people and sneaking into phone booths to slip out of your civvies and into your form-fitting red-and-blue outfit with a cape as a manly fashion flourish. Sure Lois Lane the cutie-pie on the school newspaper pretends to ignore the Clark Kent whom you appear to be in class but she adores the inner you your secret Superman strong noble virile and darned near indestructible except for your Achilles heel Kryptonite. And your X-ray vision comes in handy when you stroll past the girls locker room. That notion of manliness is now as antique as locomotives phone booths and great metropolitan newspapers. Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster introduced the first four-color superhero in the pages of Action Comics No. 1 in June 1938 -- 75 years ago this month. Dated is the word to be applied to Supermans accoutrements today. As the prime mode of long-distance business travel trains gave way to planes and then to Skype. The daily newspaper is threatened by the Internet more than Metropolis ever was by Lex Luthor. And you cant change clothes in an iPhone; theres no app for that. If anything has survived and thrived in the three-quarters of a century since the Man of Steel was born into the American consciousness its superhero comic books and their billion-dollar descendants superhero movies. (MORE The Birth of Superman 1938) Now about those kids all those generations of Superman fanciers. Its fine that they had a figure to mirror the deathless hero they imagined as their alter ego -- but they didnt think things through. The X-ray vision for example it doesnt penetrate walls to detect lurking villains; it wouldnt undress Lois down to her undies as Christopher Reeve did to Margot Kidder in the 1978 Superman movie. Real radiology focused on a human form would reveal the bones and organs and perhaps the diseases within. Its not a gift but a curse unless Superman were to give up his day job and become the infallible detector of cancer in its early curable stages. Later in Man of Steel as the adult Clark Kent (Henry Cavill) he will use this gift to perform instant laser surgery on Lois (Amy Adams). But if you were a 12-year-old who suddenly learned he had X-ray vision it would freak you out. Man of Steel the new reboot of the Superman franchise has just such a scene. After his X-ray death vision young Clark (Dylan Sprayberry) locks himself in a Smallville school closet. His mother Martha (Diane Lane) arrives but the boy is still empowered by panic he turns the outside doorknob glowing hot until Marthas soothing words about his special nature calm him. To Clark this episode provides the first lightning flash of his Otherness; it might be the gay gene (in the closet) or Aspergers syndrome or the simple volcanic onset of nocturnal emissions. Its not. As his father Jonathan (Kevin Costner) tells him ""Youre the answer to Are we alone in the universe?"" Hes Kal-El a superior indeed supreme being sent from another planet. Thats quite a puberty present and the astonished Clark recoils as if all things considered hed rather be gay. For with great power comes a great challenge reconciling the Krypton divinity of his nature with the Kansas humanity of his nurture. (MORE Lev Grossmans On-Location Preview of Man of Steel) Directed by Zack Snyder (300 Watchmen) produced by Christopher Nolan (who directed the Dark Knight trilogy) and scripted by Dark Knight story man David S. Goyer Man of Steel is a half-great movie -- meaning the first half. Then it collapses into a familiar fight-and-destruction scenario as Kryptonian bad guy Zod (Michael Shannon) journeys to Earth and confronts Kal-El/Clark for the same sort of small-town showdown that Thor and Loki engaged in two summers ago in a Marvel epic. Belatedly arriving in Metropolis the movie stages the umpteenth replay of 9/11 with a happy-ending chaser and never adequately addresses the superhero dilemma of saving a few people while the evil enemy kills millions. The climactic face-off isnt helped by Shannon a fine actor who grimaces here as if afflicted by mad scowl disease. But for the first hour or so when it lays out Supermans origins on Krypton and his rite of passage toward realizing and growing into his identity Man of Steel is sober and superb -- the rare action movie where each spectacular event helps define the character. Whereas films like Clash of the Titans and Immortals (in which Cavill played Theseus) turned classic myths into comic books Man of Steel like Nolans Batman films strives to elevate comic-book heroes into the figures with the heft depth and burdens of Greek gods. It jettisons the gentle comedy of the Reeve series that began in 1978 doesnt bother much with romance -- Clarks relationship with Lois is less boy-meets-girl than reporter-tracks-source -- and dispenses with the red underpants that the classic Superman wore over his tights. Like its hero Man of Steel at its best is serious stripped down and pumped. (MORE Richard Corlisss Review of Christopher Nolans The Dark Knight Rises) True to the first pages of the Superman story in Action Comics No. 1 and the opening of the 1978 Superman with Marlon Brando and Susannah York as the heros birth parents Man of Steel opens on ""a distant planet"" about to be ""destroyed by old age."" The wise scientist Jor-El (Russell Crowe) cannot persuade the Krypton synod to find a home for its citizens in other galaxies. He and his wife Lara (Ayelet Zurer) have secretly conceived Kryptons first natural child in ages; they call him Kal-El and launch him in a spaceship to Earth an atmospherically congenial planet with ""a seemingly intelligent population."" Nitpickers will note that the newborn has no diaper; the spaceship must have been a mess when he landed. Before the planet dies the renegade warrior-prince Zod and his hottie second-in-command Faoro-Ul (Antje Traue) are sentenced to ""300 cycles of somatic reconditioning"" -- which sounds like an eternity of watching Oprah reruns -- and packed off to some far-flung Alcatraz. That exile will save Zod and his rebel crew when Krypton explodes. Many years later they will chase Kal-El to Earth with plans to annihilate the indigenous population and colonize it with their own nefarious kind. (Like the Mandarin in Iron Man 3 Zod commandeers the airwaves and social media to diss the hero and warn of worldwide doom.) Only the Superboy now grown into Clark Kent mild-mannered wanderer can save Earth. But his interplanetary combat readiness may have been diluted by life on Earth where he was raised by a loving human family. (PHOTOS The Six Men Who Have Played Superman) Man of Steel takes its cue from Bryan Singers 2006 Superman Returns which posited our hero as the Christian God come to Earth to save humankind Jesus Christ Superman. Goyer goes further giving the character a backstory reminiscent of the Gospels the all-seeing father from afar (plus a mother); the Earth parents; an important portent at age 12 (Jesus talks with the temple elders; Kal-El saves children in a bus crash); the ascetic wandering in his early maturity (40 days in the desert for Jesus; a dozen years in odd jobs for Kal-El); his public life in which he performs a series of miracles; and then at age 33 the ultimate test of his divinity and humanity. ""The fate of your planet rests in your hands"" says the holy-ghostly Jor-El to his only begotten son who goes off to face down Zod the anti-God in a Calvary stampede. You could call Man of Steel the psychoanalytical case study of god-man with a two-father complex. (MORE Richard Corlisss Theological Exegesis of Superman Returns) All these New Testament allusions -- plus the image of Superman sitting in a church pew framed by a stained-glass panel of Jesus in his final days -- dont necessarily make Man of Steel any richer except for students of comparative religion. And as Goyer has noted ""We didnt come up with these allusions of Superman being Christ-like. Thats something thats been embedded in the character from the beginning."" No the dramatically piquant aspect is the movies journey beyond Superman Returns hagiography to portray the struggle of this outsider deity to adjust to his new planet and his role in it. Bursting with preternatural abilities but deprived of teachers Superman must learn to fly like any orphan duckling -- and more important to harness his powers. He learns the hard way that he cant save everyone even when hes able to. Being Superman is a burden not a lark for someone whose human qualities put him at a disadvantage against Zod. As this stud-messiah tells Lois hes not giving in to Zod ""Im surrendering to mankind."" He may be the first comic-book superhero in film who suffers the same doubts about his divine humanity as Jesus does in Nikos Kazantzakis novel The Last Temptation of Christ and the controversial 1988 movie made from it. (MORE A Contrarian Take on Martin Scorseses The Last Temptation of Christ) This Goyer-Snyder version of the Siegel-Shuster gospel retains old touchstones like Daily Planet boss Perry White (Laurence Fishburne) and even briefly Clarks boyhood girlfriend Lana Lang (Jadin Gould) familiar from Reeves third Superman film and the Smallville TV series. But it smartly concentrates on the more primal tale of a space-traveling immigrant as regal as he is illegal with an adopted planet and adoptive parents. Who could ask for better ones? Lane plays Martha as grave generous and ferociously protective of her boy this otherworldly treasure and responsibility. And Costner -- back in the fantasy Midwest heartland of Field of Dreams but this time as the father playing catch-up with his son -- bestows a solid emotional gravity on Jonathan a man who would give his life to teach Clark a lesson about the limits of superpowers. Jor-El of course has already made that sacrifice; postmortem he shows up more often than Hamlets ghost-father and counsels his son in Crowes urgent spectral kingly presence. Cavill was a finalist to play James Bond (before Daniel Craig was cast) Batman (Christian Bale) Twilights Edward (Robert Pattinson) and the 2006 Superman (Brandon Routh). He finally got a franchise and it was worth the wait. Conforming to the superhero template of the preposterously muscled hunk the Englishman also brings to the role exactly the right haunted stricken but resolute air of someone searching for a grand mystery inside him. And Adams shes nice too. (MORE Richard Corlisss View of Henry Cavill in Immortals) In his earlier movies Snyder shot mostly on bare stages with the actors speaking their lines in front of a green screen that visual effects turned into Thermopylae alternate America and a steampunk madhouse. This time perhaps encouraged by the film-loving digital-despising Nolan Snyder has shot in different locations on film. He renounces the deadpan silliness of 300 the teeming scheming of Watchmen and the Powerpuff Girls delirium of Sucker Punch for a desaturated color scheme and judicious use of shaky-cam cinematography to underline the reality of Supermans new environment and the fate in store for him. (MORE Richard Corlisss Reviews of Zack Snyders 300 Watchmen and Sucker Punch) I dont mean to make this sound like an Ingmar Bergman film of a soul in torment over Gods silence. The action is plentiful and thumping; Marvel-size thrills await you and the generations of kids who still believe in Superman. I just mean that the movie finds its true lofty footing not when it displays Kal-Els extraordinary powers but when it dramatizes Clark Kents roiling humanity. The super part of Man of Steel is just O.K.; but the man part is super.

"Review In Man of Steel Henry Cavill soars over an erratic plot - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review In Man of Steel Henry Cavill soars over an erratic plot Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic ""I can do things other people cant"" the man says with becoming modesty and can he ever. Cauterize deep wounds with a single glance leap tall buildings in a single bound things like that. Those rumors youve been hearing are true Superman is back in town.But ""Man of Steel"" is not your fathers Superman (theres no kryptonite in sight) or your grandfathers for that matter. It features brooding buff British actor Henry Cavill as a muscular yet sensitive type (think Jack Kerouac spending way too much time in the gym) trying to find himself torn between his Krypton roots and his Kansas upbringing. Who said being a superhero was easy? ""Man of Steel"" is similarly torn. Directed by Zack Snyder and written by David S. Goyer from a story by Goyer and Christopher Nolan (who also produced) this film is pulled in different directions delivering satisfactions without managing to be completely satisfying.PHOTOS Man of Steel Given the ""Dark Knight"" trilogys Nolan and Goyers involvement its no surprise that ""Man of Steel"" is conceptualized in the Batman mold a dark end of the street extravaganza where theoretically at least epic vision would be joined with dramatic heft. It hasnt worked out quite that way.On the plus side the Goyer/Nolan story is well-imagined in terms of broad outlines that are more science fiction than superhero. We follow the boy Kal-El from literally the moment of his birth on Krypton to his troubled younger years on Earth as Clark Kent to his assumption of the mantle of supermanhood just in time to face an intergalactic threat that if unchecked would yes mark the end of human life.This conceptualization works because ""Man of Steel"" is well-cast (courtesy of Lora Kennedy and Kristy Carlson) starting at the top with Cavill. Hes a superb choice for someone who needs to convincingly convey innate modesty occasional confusion and eventual strength.PHOTOS Superman at 75 - 10 key comic covers Ably supporting him on Earth are Kevin Costner and Diane Lane as adoptive parents Jonathan and Martha Kent as well as Amy Adams such a dead-on selection for uber-intrepid journalist Lois Lane (shes a Pulitzer Prize winner) that she was up for the role previously.Also effective are the folks from Krypton including Russell Crowe as super-serious scientist Jor-El Kal-Els father Michael Shannon as the relentless Gen. Zod and German actress Antje Traue as the generals right hand Faora-Ul. (Who thinks up these names?)But for all its positive aspects including a noteworthy visualization of the dying planet Krypton from production designer Alex McDowell and his team ""Man of Steel"" is only partially realized.While its ambition and scope pull one way its pinched and unconvincing sense of drama pull the other. Whatever strengths director Snyder revealed in films like ""300"" and ""Watchmen"" making stories like this emotionally convincing is not one of them.Snyder does have a fondness and a facility for action set pieces and ""Man of Steel"" is chockablock with hand-to-hand combat hurtling cars huge explosions and howling infernos. Unfortunately these pitched battles are so numerous that the effect is numbing leaving us battered and bludgeoned rather than exhilarated.QUIZ How well do you know the Man of Steel?This is the case right from the films beginnings on Krypton a planet that practically disintegrates before our eyes as Jor-El and wife Lara Lor-Van (Ayelet Zurer) strive to save the life of their infant son the planets ""first natural birth in centuries."" (Dont ask.)As the unyielding Gen. Zod leads a rebellion against the planets feckless leadership Jor-El decides on a rocket to Earth as his sons future ""a seemingly intelligent population"" is his throwaway line about its residents. ""Hell be an outcast a freak theyll kill him"" worries mom while dad insists ""hell be a god."" Which shows how much parents know.Once the drama moves to Earth ""Man of Steel"" cleverly picks up the story with the erstwhile Kal-El now Clark Kent as a rootless young man in his 20s a tormented soul who wants to use his superpowers for good but fears what humans will say if he does. (Shots of the costume-less Clark doing the occasional good deed bare-chested so emphasize the impressive physique Cavill achieved via months of exercise that his body looks computer-enhanced.)VIDEO Upcoming summer filmsWith this as a starting part ""Man of Steel"" flashes back to the troubles that the boy Clark had adjusting to Earth as he gets used to X-ray vision and super hearing as well as taunts from his Smallville classmates. (Reading Plato as a kid probably didnt help.) It all changes for Clark when three things happen almost at once He has a cute meet with the intrepid Ms. Lane; he connects with the spirit of Jor-El who fills him in on his history; and he has to contend with the invasive presence of Gen. Zod who is willing to destroy Earth to get his hands on something essential called the Codex that Clark unknowingly brought with him from Krypton.If all of this isnt exactly clear its because ""Man of Steels"" plot tends to veer off into confusion as well as excess inclinations that the films lack of a deft emotional touch only emphasizes. As Clark Kent could testify being all-around super is a challenge not every film can meet. kenneth.turanlatimes.com---------------------------------Man of SteelMPAA rating PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence action and destruction and some language.Running time 2 hours 23 minutes.Playing In general release.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 527 a.m. EDT June 13 2013The story while sometimes soaring is other times grounded by a hyperactive and numbing vibe. But Henry Cavill has the strapping good looks of the comic icon and humanity to match his superheroism.Henry Cavill plays a persuasive Superman in Man of Steel. Unfortunately the film suffers from director Zack Snyders heavy reliance on spectacle.(Photo Clay Enos Warner Bros. Pictures)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY review 1/2 stars out of fourStars Henry Cavill Amy Adams Michael Shannon Russell Crowe Diane Lane Kevin Costner Laurence FishburneRated PG-13; Runtime 2 hours 23 minutes; Opens Thursday in select cities and Friday nationwideFor a movie thats all about saving Earth theres an unaccountable amount of destruction in Man of Steel.Amid the plethora of computer-generated demolition flame-outs and explosions theres a nuanced origin story ( 1/2 out of four; rated PG-13; opens Thursday in select cities and Friday nationwide). But it often gets drowned out by numbing spectacle and director Zack Snyders seeming determination to fashion the most super-charged superhero movie ever.British actor Henry Cavill is a terrific Kal-El/Clark Kent/Superman subtly playing emotional moments and persuasively conveying pangs of self-doubt. He just as nimbly rises to the occasion of soaring heroism. Christopher Reeve would be proud.If only Snyder had seen fit to focus more on Clarks conflicts and let the tale unfold more naturally with fewer in-your-face pyrotechnics. Ubiquitous product placement takes the viewer out of the movie and Hans Zimmers overpowering score further distances us.Amy Adams is a charming and contemporary Lois Lane Diane Lane is wonderful as Clarks warmly reassuring adopted mom Martha Kent and Russell Crowe is effectively noble as Kal-Els biological father Jor-El.STORY Man of Steel star Henry Cavill needs nerves of steelVIDEO Henry Cavill on why his Superman is differentPREMIERE Cavill steels himself for Superman premiere But Michael Shannon who has mastered the art of coiled menace like few others (see The Runaways and The Iceman) is strangely bland as the single-minded Kryptonian villain General Zod who is determined to take down our hero. Antje Traue as rebel warrior Faora-Ul is more threatening than her commander.Kal-El is born on Krypton just as the planet faces environmental destruction. In a desperate act to protect their son Jor-El and Lara Lor-Van (Ayelet Zurer) encase him in a steel capsule and send him barreling toward Earth. The baby is discovered on Kansas farmland and is lovingly raised (and named Clark) by Martha and Jonathan Kent (Kevin Costner). Early in his childhood in Smallville Jonathan encourages his son to explore his destiny -- but also worries that humans will fear him for his superpowers. ""I have to believe that you were sent here for a reason and even if it takes the rest of your life you owe it to yourself to find out what that reason is"" he tells Clark.When the audience meets him he is a solitary young man drifting and suffering from the loneliness imposed by hiding his powers. He connects with intrepid reporter Lois Lane who sees him for what he is and doesnt flinch.STORY Superman Henry Cavill reveals I was fatCOMICS Superman gets a new DC Comics logo for 75th anniversaryMOVIE FORUM Who wore it best?

Yes but they -- Superman and the military vs. Zod and his merciless Kryptonian acolytes -- ruined huge swaths of the city and laid waste to scores of humans.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet More space opera than superhero movie Man Of Steel Zack Snyders Superman reboot focuses almost exclusively on the DC Comics icons alien backstory. This gamble doesnt entirely pay off; by effectively denying Superman his defining traits--his complex relationships to duty and humanity--the movie robs the character of any depth or agency. Decisions not daring shape heroes and since Man Of Steels Superman never has a chance to make a decision he never registers as anything more than a handsome inscrutable alien with a smug smirk. Man Of Steel opens on planet Krypton a Roger Dean prog-rock album cover filtered through the sensibilities of David Lynchs Dune. There tough-guy scientist Jor-El played by Russell Crowe pleads with the planets government to take action against a coming environmental cataclysm. (This is the first of the movies many half-hearted attempts at political relevance which culminate in Superman punching out a Predator drone.) However a coup by Michael Shannons General Zod interrupts the proceedings leaving Crowe no choice but to steal a MacGuffin called the Codex and launch it into space along with his newborn son Kal-El. As Krypton implodes Kal-Els spacecraft crash-lands in a field in Kansas. The movie then leaps forward 33 years to find the adult Kal-El now played by Henry Cavill aimlessly drifting around Nova Scotia and working odd jobs. The discovery of an ancient Kryptonian spacecraft in Northern Canada brings Cavill into contact with Amy Adams Lois Lane; it also alerts Shannon who survived the destruction of Krypton to Cavills location. The rest of the film is set over a couple of days as Cavill fights Shannon and his gang in a series of superpowered battles all of which are admittedly pretty cool-looking; interspersed throughout are flashbacks to Cavills childhood as well as comically insistent product placement for IHOP. Man Of Steel eschews the usual trappings of Superman stories--right down to the word ""Superman"" which is uttered only once. Theres no Lex Luthor no Kryptonite no glasses no mild-mannered reporter very little Daily Planet and even less Metropolis. However the movie is anything but stripped down; like Snyders Sucker Punch its a confused but fascinating mishmash of religious military and sexual imagery. One scene finds Cavill framed with a stained-glass Jesus behind him. In another he--robbed of his powers by a gaping hole in narrative logic--races around a Kryptonian spaceship seemingly designed by H.R. Giger vulvar doorways and all. Cavill--whose performance involves more posing than acting--is alternately presented as an alien messiah a superweapon and an American flag flapping in the wind; the one thing he never gets to be is a character. As a result Man Of Steel sometimes feels like arty advertising--the tentpole movie equivalent of a car ad that invokes images of freedom or luxury without ever mentioning the price or specifications.

Photo Clay Enos/Warner Bros The latest Superman ""reboot"" generically titled Man of Steel is rich in inessentials. Sensibly concluding that the last thing we need is another hour of young Clark Kent gradually discovering his superhuman powers in Smallville while Ma and Pa Kent trade worried looks director Zack Snyder has relegated most of the Midwest corn to flashbacks and focused (less sensibly) on what matters to him most Superman as an alien coping with his alienness in the course of a massive outer-space invasion from Krypton avengers. So you get spidery machines drilling into the Earth and blasting planes out of the sky and flattening Manhattan as thoroughly as Godzilla Rodan and the rest of the Toho gang demolished Tokyo. You get much ado about Krypton genes and a McGuffin called a Codex -- or Kotex I didnt get the spelling. You get War of the Worlds and Independence Day and lots of noise and clutter -- but never the simple charm of the original comic by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster or the faintly self-abashed handsomeness of Christopher Reeve. The movie isnt dead on arrival like Snyders over-reverent Watchmen. But its pleasure-free. The new Supey is a colorless Brit named Henry Cavill with a deep cleft in the middle of his chin and deeper ones where his lats meet his deltoids meet his pecs. His physique is as ripped as any of Snyders 300 Spartans -- which flies in the face of the notion that Superman unlike Batman doesnt need to spend hours at the gym to maintain his prodigious strength. Before we see him we spend a long-ish stretch on Krypton which is now an expensive-looking world of flying beasts and towering cliffs. Supeys dad Jor-El is played by Russell Crowe in peacenik mode -- which guarantees this sometimes-great actor will put nothing of his galvanic true self in the role and instead hide behind faux-Brit diction and a woeful countenance. Hands beatifically clasped in front of him he gazes sadly at General Zod (Michael Shannon). He shares Zods conviction that Kryptons elderly ruling council have made no provisions for the planets imminent destruction (thanks to reckless plundering of its natural resources hint hint) but not Zods impulse to shoot said council members in the head. Zod also has some crypto-racist (or Krypto-racist) ideas about re-creating the planet on a world of lesser beings with the help of said Kotex. Preaching the need to coexist harmoniously with other beings Jor-El dispatches his only son to planet Earth to share the heavenly gospel. A Though gravity is different on Earth than it is on Krypton co-producer Christopher Nolan ensures this will be the gravest Superman yet. There is no bright pop in the new costume. The blue is halfway to black the cape burgundy. That makes for some striking deep-toned images of the lonely savior against the colossal skyscrapers of Metropolis and Supermans X-ray eyes have an impressive unearthly glow. But the fumbling mild-mannered Clark Kent counterpoint is missing. Whatever future installments this new saga will bring the Clark of Man of Steel doesnt get to play a reporter haplessly trying to woo an impatient Lois. The delightful contrast between nerd and Samson -- the genius element of the Superman myth -- will have to wait. Lois is Amy Adams who carries her scenes with single-minded gumption. No role has given Adams as excellent an outlet for her Katie Couric-like combination of pertness and steel. (She could have her own spinoff -- Anchorwoman of Steel.) But without the Clark-Lois banter the screwball element is gone. Perry White (Laurence Fishburne) and his Daily Planet staff watch Metropolis fall and enact mini feats of bravery. Great Caesars Ghost theyre a dull bunch. Shannon makes a super-serious Zod without a smidgen of Terence Stamps delicious camp in Superman II. Its the movies most heartfelt performance but after Zods fifth tumultuous fight with Superman Shannon -- like the movie -- becomes tiresome. The most affecting parts of Man of Steel are the most grounded featuring Kevin Costner as Pa Kent and Diane Lane as Ma. The theme -- articulated by Costner in his honest-farmer persona -- is gradualism Clark cannot fully exercise his powers until he acclimates himself to the needs of his new world and learns the motives of the father who sent him here. Hes moving sincere and for the purposes of the movie party-pooping. Watching the unprecedented spectacle of this Superman picture I thought of the producer Lynda Obsts new book Sleepless in Hollywood in which Obst explains why studios are making so many action-heavy 3-D IMAX monstrosities in lieu of anything else This is what plays in the rest of the world especially China from which an astounding 80 percent of studios profits now come according to Obst. The greed on display extends to the product placements. Amid the explosions and flying debris the Sears 7 Eleven and IHOP logos are visible from all angles. Critics and even the American public might be cool to this War of the World take on Superman but if Asian markets are onboard its pop-the-cork and green-light-the-sequel time truth justice and the Chinese way.

To read the whole story subscribe to BostonGlobe.com Man of Steel (2.5 stars) Share Comment With ""Man of Steel"" director Zack Snyder (""300"") has made a superhero blockbuster that carries the weight of its fraught times -- at least until the movie gives in to the urge to just smash things in the last half hour. The script by David S. Goyer from a story by Christopher Nolan imports the dramatic agonies of the pairs ""Dark Knight"" trilogy and its not always a comfortable fit. ""Man of Steel"" has a scope thats hard to resist but whats missing is a sense of lightness of pop joy. This is about a guy who can fly for Petes sake. As Superman Henry Cavill is very good without quite convincing us hes a star. With Amy Adams as Lois Lane Russell Crowe as Jor-El and crazy-eyed Michael Shannon as General Zod. -- Ty Burr Globe Staff How does the newest version of an iconic character stack up against his forefathers? From a financial standpoint the Independent delves into the numbers behind the series superhuman box office figures while the Week invites readers to test their Superman knowledge. Feeling confused by the relatively anonymous lead actor Henry Cavill? In a perfect world you would know who he is by now but Cavill has had the misfortune of falling just short for many big roles prior to ""Man of Steel"" as documented by GQ. ""Its also true that theres barely an iconic starmaking role of the last decade that Cavill has not come within a hairs breadth of getting and then missed out on. Take your pick from narrowly losing out to Robert Pattinson for his role in Harry Potter; to Christian Bale for Batman; to Pattinson (again) for the lead in the Twilight series (Twilight author Stephenie Meyer called Cavill the perfect Edward); to Daniel Craig for James Bond; and perhaps most remarkably to Brandon Routh for Superman otherwise known as the Superman before this one the ill-fated 2006 Bryan Singer version Superman Returns.""

"Review Man of Steel - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Man of Steel follows the grim path first trod by the Dark Knight  1/2 Video Zack Snyders Man of Steel is a visual effects spectacle Chicago Tribune movie critic Michael Phillips and Tribune reporter Chris Borrelli discuss Zack Snyders heavy use of visual effects in Man of Steel.(Posted on June 13 2013) Chicago Tribune movie critic Michael Phillips and Tribune reporter Chris Borrelli discuss Zack Snyders heavy use of visual effects in Man of Steel.(Posted on June 13 2013) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Thanks ""Man of Steel."" Because of the scene where Superman battles two of his adversaries from the planet Krypton in downtown Smallville wrecking most of an IHOP and a Sears store I now associate pancakes and appliances with pain and suffering.A sure hit if only because of its 100 ""global promotional partners"" (according to Advertising Age) and an estimated 170 million in product placement and ""collective promotional support"" ""Man of Steel"" has all the stuff it takes to compete in the modern blockbuster world. Director Zack Snyders granite-fisted 143-minute picture treats the Superman mythology with enough seriousness to satisfy scholars of the Bible or the Torah let alone presold fans of the comic book hero introduced by writer Jerry Siegel and artist Joe Shuster in 1938. This time no trace elements of camp intrude on the landscapes of Krypton Metropolis or Smallville Kan. We are a long long way from ""Superman II"" (1981) my favorite of the Superman films to date in which director Richard Lester replacing Richard Donner blended fantasy humor and viciousness with surprising ease.Well forget the humor. Director Snyder is the man behind ""300"" ""Watchmen"" and ""Sucker Punch"" three decorative slabs of digital slaughter (enjoyed parts of the first; hated the other two). He also made the 2004 remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"" by far Snyders best so far. Working from a story by producer Christopher Nolan ""Man of Steel"" turns Superman into a close cousin of Nolans ""Dark Knight"" trilogy. The scale of the destruction borders on the grotesque. By the time Superman squares off against General Zod (a fiercely effective Michael Shannon bringing the interstellar glare of doom) in a climactic city-destroying melee that goes on for what feels like weeks its no wonder the boy born Kal-El on Krypton eventually transforms into a bit of a prima donna. ""Im here to help but it has to be on my own terms"" Superman scolds Harry Lennixs Army general at one point. Nolans Batman movies proved just how far a worldwide audience was willing to follow a caped comic book hero into the heart of darkness. ""Man of Steel"" ventures in the same direction though with its emphasis on hand-held close-ups the look of this film is deliberately rough-hewn. David S. Goyers screenplay benefits from Goyers ambitious script structure a thing of interwoven flashbacks and memory-triggered leaps into Supermans past. It begins on Krypton which is falling apart fast with Russell Crowes Jor-El and Ayelet Zurers Lara sending their very special son off to Earth. You know a lot of the rest probably. Raised on a Kansas farm by good honest folk (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane play the Kents). Outcast. Freak. Superpowers. Must. Remain. Hidden.We meet Henry Cavill as Superman in his Christ-like wandering phase at age 33 working odd jobs moving on shirtlessly saving oil rig workers from a fiery death. Early on reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams) discovers the truth about a mysterious spacecraft encased in ice in the Arctic. There she meets the nomadic miracle worker shes been tracking. Though not much is expected of him Cavill is quite good less impish than Christopher Reeve more intense than Brandon Routh in the last 21/2-star Superman movie ""Superman Returns"" seven years ago.Then again Cavills enemy -- the Kryptonian out to conquer Earth -- is Shannons Zod so the intensity levels are already in the red. When Zod lets loose he and his fancy blue-light-planet-makeover machine level Metropolis in such a way as to shamelessly evoke the imagery of Sept. 11 2001. Various other films have done this already some well (Spielbergs ""War of the Worlds"") others uneasily so. Snyder films the violence in ""Man of Steel"" the way he films most of the rest of the picture Like a man chasing tornadoes and not even trying to keep subjects in frame. Its a choice and not a bad one necessarily -- the Smallville farm scenes in particular respond well to the approach -- but by the end its a visually limiting one.Few will care about such things. There are gut-wrenching (though not necessarily pleasurable) suspense scenes such as a school bus full of kids headed for a watery grave. The supporting cast includes such stalwart players as Laurence Fishburne (as editor Perry White) Christopher Meloni (as the toughest guy in the U.S. military) and Richard Schiff (a scientist hanging around to explain magnetic polarities and such). Cavill looks great in the key outfit. Maybe thats enough. The crowd at a ""Man of Steel"" preview the other night exited the theater not excited not chatty but quiet vaguely shellshocked. Was it the ridiculously loud volume levels? Or the pounding inflicted by the most protracted action sequences? Or both? This is the secret to any superhero movies success bad good or -- in the case of ""Man of Steel"" -- respectably in between. You must destroy the planet or nearly for Superman to save it and if its more work than fun to witness in 2013 Thats entertainment.mjphillipstribune.com Man of Steel -- 2 1/2 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for intense sequences of sci-fi violence action and destruction and some language)Running time 223Opens Thursday midnight Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Movies Entertainment Man of Steel Zack Snyder Henry Cavill Christopher Nolan Michael Shannon Man of Steel Top 50 superhero movies of the last 10 years Who are the early Oscars 2014 favorites?

"Superbad Man of Steel Is Redundant Unnecessary and a Colossal Waste of Talent and Money | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Culture Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters movie Superbad Man of Steel Is Redundant Unnecessary and a Colossal Waste of Talent and Money Do we really need another movie about Superman? By Rex Reed  06/11/13 600pm Henry Cavill and Amy Adams in Man of Steel. Just what we need now. Another movie about Superman. Man of Steel qualifies as one of those bloated Byzantine summer blockbusters that is here today gone by Labor Day. Now that Ive seen it clocking in at just under two and a half hours I can file it under movies I never have to see again. Color it exhausting. Here is an overproduced 225 million comic book with delusions of grandeur that was better made in 1978 and a lot more fun. Although he came from another planet Christopher Reeve was a suave all-American crusader for apple pie the American Way and the good of man. In the reboot Britains Henry Cavill is an impossibly handsome camera-ready hunk of beefcake milking camera angles for marketing ploys. Hes no Brandon Routh in Superman Returns or Eric Bana in The Hulk. Hes from TVs The Tudors he looks like a Playgirl centerfold and he can probably act too but you wont find out here. Upstaged in every scene by flying puppets and computer graphics hes at the mercy of cornball writing indifferent directing and the shadow of pretentiousness cast over the proceedings from start to finish by Christopher Nolan. Mr. Nolan already ruined Batman. Now he incinerates the innocence and humor of the Man of Steel who registers more like a Model of Marzipan. In all fairness Mr. Nolan is only the producer but hack director Zack Snyder is so under the influence of his dedication to style over substance that he seems to be receiving directions through a wire in his ear. Despite an obscene budget that could have made a giant stride in the cure for cancer there isnt much originality and the whole endeavor appears to be the work of grown men who never outgrew puberty. The first hour is exposition. You know the drill. The doomed planet Krypton has depleted its natural resources and is in danger of being taken over in a military coup by the evil General Zod (Michael Shannon trying to look sinister with a furrowed brow). Before he is tried and sentenced to death by the degenerate Zod the wise and beloved political leader Jor-El (Russell Crowe) ships his baby son Kal-El to the planet Earth where he lands in Smallville Kansas on the farm of surrogate parents Jonathan and Martha Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane) who name him Clark. They know hes got superhuman powers but fear for his safety if the bad guys find out. ""You have to keep this part of you a secret"" warns Costner. ""Youre the answer to Are we alone in the universe?"" This is tough advice when youre targeted by bullies at your job washing dishes at the local IHOP. But you cant keep a virile comic book hero down for long. Clark saves a school bus full of drowning children by lifting it off of a river bottom with his bare hands--a miracle that raises the suspicions of intrepid journalist Lois Lane while shes on assignment in Canada to inspect an object trapped in ice for 18000 years which may or may not be the spaceship that houses the remains of the demented Zod. No longer depicted as a ditzy girl reporter who is always being saved by Superman Lois is now a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist played by Amy Adams in the first mediocre and clueless performance of her career. The fun of never knowing who Superman really is has been squelched. Lois knows his identity from the start. Clark Kent is no longer a mild-mannered fellow reporter at the Daily Planet who ducks into conveniently located phone booths to change into bright blue tights in time to save the endangered citizens of Metropolis. Two-fisted editor Perry White is now Laurence Fishburne and you can forget about photographer Jimmy Olsen altogether. The indefatigable Zod arrives looking for Kal-El. ""Surrender in 24 hours or watch this world suffer the consequences"" he bellows. Its disheartening to watch a serious actor like Michael Shannon pretend he knows what hes saying. Kevin Costner gets sucked into a Kansas tornado right out of The Wizard of Oz. Diane Lanes wrinkles and liver spots are right out of the MGM makeup department files on Greer Garson in Madame Curie. The ghost of Clark Kents father Jor-El constantly reappears to offer counsel but Russell Crowe is no Marlon Brando who played the part in the 1978 version although he acts like he thinks he is. The secret to survival is inside the vessel in which Kal-El arrived now hidden in the storm cellar in Diane Lanes farmhouse. From here the movie goes haywire falling into preposterous plot twists as Lois flies through space in a jet-propelled pea pod crashing into a cornfield. For the final hour of seemingly interminable drivel Kansas is overrun with alien combat forces that blow up Sears. You pass the time pondering weightier questions like ""Will this thing break summer box-office records for kids on vacation who will sit through anything as long as the projectors keep running?"" and ""Does Henry Cavill have legs or will he go the way of fellow hunk Taylor Kitsch star of the ill-fated bomb John Carter?"" Meanwhile you learn vital things like what the ""S"" on the Superman costume stands for. Redundant unnecessary and a colossal waste of talent and money you can pretty much sum up Man of Steel in the scene in which a lady police officer watches with her mouth wide open as Superman tosses aside tanks like Tinker Toys. ""What are you smiling about captain?"" asks another cop. ""Nothing sir--I just think hes hot."" rreedobserver.com MAN OF STEEL Written by David S.

"Man of Steel shines brightly for the future Review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesMan of Steel shines brightly for the future ReviewThe most impressive feat of Man of Steel is making us care about a Superman reboot that nobody really asked for -- and the thought of a streamlined sequel is even better. By Peter HowellMovie CriticWed. June 12 2013Man of SteelStarring Henry Cavill Michael Shannon Amy Adams Kevin Costner Diane Lane and Laurence Fishburne. Directed by Zack Snyder. At GTA theatres. Running time 143 minutes.A planet explodes buildings collapse and heroes and villains battle amidst the debris in Man of Steel a blockbuster in every sense of the word.The films most impressive feat however is considerably more cerebral convincing us that the Superman movie we dont need is one that we may actually want -- and the thought of a more streamlined sequel is even better. Article Continued BelowZack Snyders take on the familiar comic book saga is every bit the spectacle youd expect from the man who made zombies run (Dawn of the Dead) beefcakes tussle (300) and vigilantes rage (Watchmen). MORE ON THESTAR.COMThis Is the End review Grin and reap itThe Purge a deadly night with a blunt message reviewThe Hangover Part III a sobering conclusion reviewSnyder packs more details into a single montage than most directors put into an entire movie. Hes in no rush to place thoughtful British actor Henry Cavill (TVs The Tudors) into the body-hugging revamped Superman suit or even to have his superhero referred to by name which barely happens.Instead Snyder luxuriates in making Man of Steel a true origin story giving us a view of doomed planet Krypton never before glimpsed in innumerable previous Superman movies. Its a smoky sci-fi world of ancient splendour Gigeresque nightmares and Freudian daydreams where quicksilver gadgets all hint of sexual insertion. Its where leading scientist Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and military defender General Zod (Michael Shannon) have waged futile attempts to protect the populace from impending extermination the result of environmental abuse the ruling aristocracy has failed to take seriously.Jor-El and his wife Lara (Ayelet Zurer) have secretly conceived and born a son Kal-El whom they dispatch to Earth as Krypton explodes carrying with him the planets ""Codex"" (global DNA) and a parting wish to ""make a better world than ours was."" Furious General Zod brutally intervenes but his actions and intentions arent yet fully revealed.Kal-El soon to be known as Clark Kent makes a rough landing on Earth. So does Man of Steel alas which sets about hitting the standard Superman story marks with considerably less finesse than at the movies outset. Snyders propulsion hits the padding of an overstuffed story by screenwriter David S. Goyer (Blade) and producer Christopher Nolan of the rebooted Batman franchise.We meet in due course Kal-Els adoptive Earth parents Kansas farmers Jonathan and Martha Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane); scoop-hungry newspaper reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams); her gruff Daily Planet editor Perry White (Laurence Fishburne); and assorted military and government shouters who will soon be coping with an alien invasion and winner-take-all battle.The good news is the casting is impeccable beginning with Cavill as an uncommonly brooding but refreshingly deep Superman. The script doesnt give him much to say but it doesnt need to. Every thought that crosses his brow registers him as a benign alien presence struggling to cope with a hostile new world one that he cant yet fully reveal himself to.Shannons Zod has similar dramatic weight being a villain more by circumstance than by intent. His zeal to protect and recreate Krypton violently exceeds his mandate and the only thing missing from the portrayal is the wickedly dry humour that Shannon excels at.Humour is rarer than kryptonite throughout Man of Steel and thats just part of the bad news about the film. Its likely more Nolans fault than Snyders since the one thing lacking from Nolans otherwise sterling The Dark Knight Rises last summerwas the dark levity previously supplied by the late Heath Ledgers Joker.Man of Steel is almost too generous with the action set pieces all of them set to Hans Zimmers thunderous score. You lose track of how many times either Superman or Zod slam each other into a building which inevitably collapses under them but you can count the films witty remarks on one hand.Ditto for romance the slowly developing connection between our shy leading man and Adams forthright Lois Lane is not exactly one for the cosmos since hes a beer-sipping introvert and shes a whisky-shooting extrovert. This is not the same as saying theyre not right for each other. Time will tell and Man of Steels grandest achievement is making us care enough about all these characters that thoughts of the inevitable sequel beckon rather than repel.Origin stories rarely achieve 100 per cent success since theres usually too much story to their origins.

Oy to have such problems These days Id settle for a director who could crack wise once in a while. Zack Snyders dull-as-dirt Man of Steel (the second reboot in seven years and still not getting it done) feels like a straitjacketed affair scared of ever wandering into humor self-deprecation or romantic byplay. Produced by king of pain Christopher Nolan it forgets to give the new Kal-El (muscle-bound Henry Cavill) a single recognizable emotion save The Dark Knights all-purpose brood--which isnt going to cut it when our S-clad hero more than any other has to inspire a gushing citywide love (so well-captured in the Koch-era original). The films coyness is frustrating Did they really need to cut Clark Kents mild-mannered reporter from most of the scenario? Thats the concept guys. Deal with it. Heres what the somber fan base seems to want these days an elaborate Krypton-set intro complete with Avatar-like flying creatures and Russell Crowe running around with various keys and skulls (dont ask); plenty of rain-dappled Kansas pageantry made for misty-eyed dads; and an all-too-talky Zod (Michael Shannon nowhere near as enraged as he was in his viral sorority video). The better actors--Kevin Costner chiefly as the adoptive Earth father--strain to supply warmth but mostly the minutes stretch into great expanses of blahness much of them filled with Transformers-grade skyscraper snapping and bloodless catastrophe. Open your mouth you want to say to Cavill; inspire us a little. Unfortunately the movies title is apt.

Its not a dark tone movie a lot of people have been saying its as dark as the Nolan batman trilogy - No clue what so ever. There is more action a compelling story and an emotional story and it is very good. I personally believe its as good if not better than Super hero movies of the last 2-3 years. Its certainly on a level playing field with batman begins. Four and half our of five. Im just so happy Superman is back and my word its back with a bang. four amp; half out of five. P.S DONT LISTEN TO CRITICS. They are vampires who suck the soul out the best of movies. Just because they say low scores Dont make it a bad one Some newspaper critics media critics slate batman begins and The original Superman its all down to personal opinion.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr UP UP AND AWAY Henry Cavill takes off as the latest actor to take on the role of Clark Kent/Superman (Clay Enos) C Man of Steel Genre Action/Adventure; Starring Amy Adams Henry Cavill Russell Crowe Diane Lane; Director Zack Snyder; Release Date Wide 06/14/2013; Runtime (in minutes) 144; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted June 25 2013 -- 1200 AM EDT Being Superman isnt as simple as it once was. Seventy-five years ago when the Kryptonian caped-crusader first appeared on the cover of Action Comics 1 hoisting a car over his head he not only stood for truth justice and the American way he also had a virtual monopoly on the men-in-tights genre. Lately though that field has gotten awfully crowded. The local multiplex is lousy with celluloid crime fighters. So what turf is left for good old Clark Kent? Thats the nagging question that director Zack Snyders Man of Steel tries -- and ultimately fails -- to answer. Snyder whose best films are 2004s adrenalized Dawn of the Dead remake and 2007s hyperstylized Spartan saga 300 has teamed up with producer Christopher Nolan to give us a cooler more conflicted Superman. But their Dark Knight-style makeover never quite comes together. Sure Superman is still faster than a speeding bullet and more powerful than a locomotive (and thanks to the impossibly handsome Henry Cavill an easy-on-the-eyes slice of spandex-clad beefcake to boot). But hes been transformed into the latest in a long line of soul-searching super-brooders trapped between his devastated birth planet of Krypton and his adopted new home on Earth. Hes just another haunted outsider grappling with issues. At the risk of damning Cavill with faint praise the 30-year-old Brit makes a better Man of Steel than the milquetoast Brandon Routh did in 2006s Superman Returns. But he isnt exactly Mr. Charisma either. And I suspect that Superman aficionados will be disappointed by just how joyless most of Snyders reboot is. During a prologue that goes on way too long setting the bloated tone for the film Supermans father Jor-El (Russell Crowe) squares off against General Zod (Michael Shannon) on Krypton. The planet is on the verge of destruction and Jor-El ships his newborn son off to Earth to save him prompting the maniacal Zod to roar about his plans for revenge. With its shock-and-awe barrage of sci-fi fire and brimstone the opening-act salvo should dazzle and transport us. Instead it just gets weighed down by CGI overkill and thickets of exposition about a Kryptonian codex. Things pick up a bit down on Earth where little Kal-El has crash-landed in Kansas and been raised by the Kents (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane). Theyve rechristened him Clark a boy whos taught to keep his special gifts under wraps -- especially after he saves a busful of classmates and draws the wrong kind of attention. Cavill plays the grown-up Clark as a sort of existential loner who drifts from town to town leaving a series of good deeds in his mysterious wake...until Lois Lane (Amy Adams) figures out his game. The 21st-century Lois isnt the gullible gal Friday she was in the old comics or the Christopher Reeve Superman films where she was played by Margot Kidder. Now shes a hard-nosed Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter. Thats progress I guess. But theres a distinct lack of heat between Adams and Cavill and their stabs at sub-sitcom humor fall flat. Meanwhile Shannons Zod huffs and puffs demanding that the puny earthlings hand over Superman which leads to endless brawls between the two where neither seems able to get hurt. I understand that fight scenes like these have become de rigueur centerpieces in comic-book popcorn extravaganzas but here they go on forever and have a numbing sameness. Theyre simply excuses to smash the scenery to bits while Hans Zimmer works up a sweat beating the drums of war on the soundtrack. The only moments of real spectacle come when Superman learns to fly. He rockets through the air like a comet and its thrilling. There arent enough of these gee-whiz moments of wonder in Man of Steel. Never has a race to save the fate of humankind seemed so tedious.

"Review Man of Steel flies but doesnt soar - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Man of Steel flies but doesnt soarBy Charlie McCollumcmccollummercurynews.comPosted 06/11/2013 040617 PM PDTUpdated 06/12/2013 044944 PM PDT In Theaters This Week Get showtimes watch movie trailers Opened Wednesday This is the End Opening Friday Dirty Wars Fill the Void The Kings of Summer Man of Steel Man of Steel 3-D Man of Steel IMAX Much Ado About Nothing Pandoras Promise Related StoriesJun 11Hans Zimmer soars with new Man of Steel scoreAs iconic as he has been since his creation in the 1930s Superman has always been something of a problematic character -- particularly on film.Over time Supes has become all but indestructible the rampaging Doomsday of the comic books aside. He is so true blue and virtuous and yes All-American that he has no nuance certainly none of the dark corners of the soul that afflict Batman and other superheroes. There is a reason why Green Arrow always refers to him as the Big Blue Boy Scout.Only occasionally do slivers of something more complex pierce the Superman iconography the superheroes as misguided gods theme of the graphic novel ""Kingdom Come"" the teen angst of televisions ""Smallville."" Henry Cavill as Superman in ""Man of Steel"" (Clay Enos/Warner Bros. Pictures) The makers of the new ""Man of Steel"" -- director Zack Snyder (""300"") and screenwriter David S. Goyer working on a story from producer Christopher Nolan (director of the Dark Knight films) -- seize on those hints of gray in their reboot of a franchise that hasnt really clicked since 1980s ""Superman II."" The result is a film that while relentlessly grim and badly in need of humor manages to be a smart nuanced take on the Superman mythology. It successfully tweaks Supermans now-familiar origin story to make it more complex and more interesting. In addition it carries enough visual and action punch to succeed on that level.Advertisement The Clark Kent (Henry Cavill) we first meet in ""Man of Steel"" is hardly a Superman (that name for the character is actually used only once in the movie). He is a man in his 30s drifting through life going from job to job with only occasional flashes of his powers. Much of the films first half consists of flashbacks to the dying planet of Krypton and to the Smallville of Clarks youth.There are far more psychological layers to this Superman-in-the-making with a fuller exploration of the tragic Krypton and Clarks relationship with his adopted Earth parents Jonathan and Martha Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane). In fact big chunks of the early ""Man of Steel"" are carried by Costners Kent and by Russell Crowes Jor-El Supermans two fathers. Crowe in particular is a weighty presence as he defends son Kal-El long enough for the baby to be sent rocketing to Earth and away from the clutches of General Zod (Michael Shannon) a military leader staging a coup against the government in what he sees as one last attempt to save the planet. This film publicity image released by Warner Bros. Pictures shows Henry Cavill as Superman in ""Man of Steel."" (AP Photo/Warner Bros. Pictures Clay Enos) ( Clay Enos ) One big shift in the Superman storyline comes when Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams) discovers his secret early on and actually helps him protect it. That doesnt last long though as General Zod and his followers (the only other survivors of the destruction of Krypton) turn up looking for Kal-El. Since most of humanity didnt know there was an all-powerful godlike alien walking the planet theyre not sure whose side to take -- and the American military simply wants to blow the heck out of all the superbeings.As you might expect this all ends up in an extended and often spectacular battle that takes out most of Smallville and a good chunk of Metropolis. The final showdown between Superman and Zod is particularly long and brutal ending with a ""Dark Knight""-like moment that may jolt some of the audience.Ive never been a huge fan of Snyders work. (He really made a hash out of the brilliant Alan Moore/David Gibbons comic series ""The Watchmen."") But on ""Man of Steel"" he does a respectable and sometimes inspired job of remaking the basic Superman tale.Cavill is perfectly fine as Supes although its not until the very end that he gets to flash the kind of charm and sly wit that Christopher Reeve brought to the role. Shannon a terrific actor is a big plus as Zod and you want to see more of Adams as Lois because she animates every scene she is in. Crowe Costner and Lane all do fine by their parts.That said ""Man of Steel"" is just too grim to be fully successful and way too heavy-handed in its attempts to draw parallels between Clark/Kal-El and Jesus. OK guys we get it -- godlike figure willing to sacrifice himself for all mankind -- so let it go.If just a few glimmers of the wry humor of say ""The Avengers"" and of the joy that was watching Reeve soar into the skies for the first time had made their way into ""Man of Steel"" this film really would have been something.For film news and more follow Charlie McCollum at Twitter.com/charlie_mccollu.MAN OF STEEL    Rating PG-13 (for intense sci-fi action and violence)Cast Henry Cavill Amy Adams Russell Crowe and Michael ShannonDirector Zack SnyderRunning time 2 hours 23 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Curb Your Enthusiasm The long wait for new episodes is almost overGame of Thrones Season 8 definitely the lastReview Holocaust haunts family in The Gathering Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

(Warner Bros.) Print Email Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on June 11 2013 at 252 PM updated June 13 2013 at 342 PM comments More than a few Superman fans have been hoping that ""Man of Steel"" would do for their beloved hero what ""Batman Begins"" did for the Dark Knight making him more complex more conflicted more tortured. It doesnt. And thank heavens. Because the two characters are not the same. Batman is hurt and human. An emotionally scarred loner he tears the pain out of himself by inflicting it on others (albeit villains who are even more disturbed than he is). Batman is about fear about shadows about lifelong obsessions. Superman is perfect -- and inhuman. A ""strange visitor from another planet"" he too has lost his parents. But he was found by loving new ones and instilled with bedrock values. Superman is about honor about courage about self-sacrifice. Batman is a warning. Superman is a hope. ""Man of Steel"" -- which was directed by unabashed comic-book fan Zack Snyder -- gets all that. It treats Superman not just with a purists respect but with old-school Golden Age awe. Theres no angst here and little irony. (If youre expecting corny gags about telephone booths -- dont.) Instead the film sets out to explain what we loved about this character to begin with. True it gets off to a slow and uncertain start rehashing Supermans Krypton origins. Every fan knows this story already and it doesnt add much; it would have been riskier and more exciting to skip Krypton -- and even Smallville -- and pick up with Superman as an adult. The movie -- after too many flashbacks -- finally gets to that point following him around as he wanders the country working odd jobs and surreptitiously saving people. (The footloose superhero-in-disguise is a great angle its like a sunnier Wolverine -- and could have been its own film.) But then General Zod arrives. And suddenly its on with the entire fate of Earth in the balance. Zod is played by Michael Shannon and although the actors become too much of the go-to guy for directors casting off-center villains -- a quieter calmer Zod would be even more frightening -- he gives the general more depth than he had in the original franchise. Shannons Zod isnt a devil; hes a man doing his awful duty. Henry Cavill is a bit bland as Superman -- he doesnt have Christopher Reeves wry confidence -- but he certainly looks good (and even better out of his costume). And Amy Adams gives Lois Lane a touching almost maternal affection for this mystery man. (It will be interesting to see if the two can strike real romantic sparks in the sequel.) And there will be a sequel of course because even after that uncertainty in the first half hour -- and a misguided eventually almost comical turn by Russell Crowe as Jor-El -- ""Man of Steel"" mostly delivers. And credit for that goes to its director. Snyder hasnt always been his own best judge of material. But hes always had a true love of pop pulp fiction and a perfectly complementary style -- the gory sprays of ""300"" the stark color contrasts of ""Watchmen"" the shock-cut action of ""Sucker Punch."" Its shown off best in this films many action scenes from Supermans rescue of oil-rig workers to his final confrontation with Zod (although as always the use of 9/11 imagery sounds a sour note). And there are quieter surprises too as when in Clark Kents lonely childhood his X-ray vision turns his classmates into grinning skeletons. Snyders fan-friendly work also helps push along a script that can get a little too serious. Although Supermans original creators Joe Shuster and Jerry Siegel clearly drew on many metaphors -- its the ultimate Immigrant Makes Good story -- I doubt they intended to make him a Christ figure. This though writers David S. Goyer and Christopher Nolan do explicitly -- too explicitly in fact. Its one thing to note that Superman has been sent here by his father in hopes of redeeming wayward humans; its another to make Jor-El into Our Father and then hammer home the point. Yet there are several references to Supermans age (33) his wanderings and his doubts (with Crowe ultimately incessantly popping up as a sort of Holy Spirit to offer counsel and courage). At one point -- great Caesars ghost -- our tortured hero even hovers in the air arms outstretched like some crucified messiah. Henry Cavill as the ""Man of Steel"" once again making the world safe.Warner Bros. Nolan has always enjoyed slipping metaphors in among the eye candy -- like the nods to the French Revolution and Occupy Wall Street in ""The Dark Knight Returns"" -- but he used to be subtler than this. Subtext is something that should be woven through a story not dumped into an audiences lap like an upended box of popcorn. Besides the parallels were always there for anyone to discover if they wanted -- or to ignore. Because ultimately Superman is about nothing more or and less than human aspiration. Its about turning your face up the stars and daydreaming of soaring up up... and away. And we need that now more than ever. Ratings note The film contains violence. Man of Steel (PG-13) Warner Bros (143 min.) Directed by Zack Snyder. With Henry Cavill Michael Shannon Russell Crowe Amy Adams.

Henry Cavill fits the suit and nails the otherness of an alien who cant fit in on Earth. (Clay Enos) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated Tuesday June 11 2013 316 PM Title Man of Steel Film Info With Henry Cavill Amy Adams Michael Shannon Russell Crowe. An alien being uses his powers to save the Earth. Director; Zack Snyder (223) PG-13 Violence destructive imagery. Area Theaters. Opens Friday. Superman has been a fixture in movies and TV every decade since he showed up in 1938. The new ""Man of Steel"" works hard to reclaim ground the iconic comic creation has lost to other heroes. The serious-minded result has many super-cool moments. But when it gets clunky its super-meh. Basically a remake of the action bits from 1980s ""Superman II"" ""Steel"" pushes the sci-fi elements. The alien invasion-heavy result is like ""Independence Day"" in a cape though at least its hero doesnt get Green Lantern-ized. Director Zack Snyder (""300"") keeps it reverent -- up to a point. Cavill shows he doesnt need a costume to look the part of a super hero. (Clay Enos/Clay Enos) A lengthy setup details Kryptons destruction as scientist Jor-El (Russell Crowe) tells the planets rulers that abuse of natural resources has doomed them. Military enforcer General Zod (Michael Shannon) seems to be an ally but Zod wants revolution. Jor-Els infant son Kal-El is sent to Earth as Zod and his gang are sent to prison in the Phantom Zone. Krypton blows up; then we see adult Kal-Els (Henry Cavill) struggles with identity. Flashbacks tell how the kindly Kansas Kents (Kevin Costner Diane Lane) found him named him Clark and told the haunted boy he can choose between good or evil. Amy Adams as Lois Lane is on the mysterious superhero reporting beat. (Clay Enos) Convoluted events introduce reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams) and a Krypton ship that crashed on Earth 20000 years ago. In it Kal learns his origins and accidentally alerts a now-free Zod that Earth is good real estate. The angry general aims to build a new Krypton here and the alien Lane dubs ""Superman"" must stop him. Some familiar moments cant help but echo 1978s ""Superman The Movie."" This is however not a wry homage as the misbegotten ""Superman Returns"" was in 2006. General Zod (Michael Shannon) makes eye contact with Superman. (Warner Bros. Pictures) But Snyder struggles to set up huge moments that dont take off. Massive scenes of destruction in Clarks hometown of Smallville and in Metropolis (A New York stand-in is again hit by 9/11 imagery) are missing memorable execution. Youre not left with ""That was great"" but ""What were the metal tentacles fighting  Superman?"" The subdued look is refreshing though and the casting is perfect. Cavill walks a tricky line winding up with the right amount of earnestness. Like Christian Bales Batman Cavills Britishness (you cant tell behind a fake American accent) gives him an Otherness. And like Christopher Reeve Cavill wears the suit not vice-versa. Russell Crowes Jor-El pontificates on the impending destruction of Krypton. (Warner Bros. Pictures/Courtesy of Warner Bros. Picture) The always-great Shannon uses his ability to underplay ferocity to such intense effect Zod is intimidating without lifting a finger. Adams is Alpha Female as girl reporter and finally injects sexiness into the first lady of herodom. Costners easy Americana is shorthand for Pa Kents decency (it makes sense that a modern-day Clark would be raised by the hippie farmer of ""Field of Dreams""). And Crowe adds a He-Man quality to his God role. It doesnt make his pronouncements any less silly -- or explain why he cant build an escape pod built for three -- but it amps up Jor-Els presence. Despite some true-blue juice ""Man of Steel"" has flaws it cant overcome. That it doesnt clear them all in a single bound may say more about how our world has changed than the naivete Supermans universe requires to survive.

Yes we know Spider-Man and Batman were just troubled sons with daddy issues. But its harder to make those claims for a Superman tale even when the producer is Batman regenerator Christopher Nolan - a man with more backstories than an osteopath. Just how real can the story of a genetically-modified baby launched to Earth from a planet called Krypton ever feel? And so its no surprise that Man of Steel feels both modern and traditional - a halfway house between the broodier Nolan way of shaking things up and the louder bone-crunching style that director Zack Snyder established with films such as 300 and Sucker Punch. Man of Steel is punchy engaging and fun even if it slips into a final 45 minutes of explosions and fights during which reason starts to vanish and the science gets muddy. It opens with a lengthy preamble explaining how Jor-El (Russell Crowe) launched his son Kal to Earth just as his planet was falling apart and how failed coup leader General Zod (Michael Shannon a muted villain) was banished at the same time. Its here and at the end that Snyder is at his most baroque first he indulges the weird science of Krypton and later he enjoys giving America a vicious pounding when Zod tracks down Superman. Its in the middle section post-Krypton pre-showdown that the film hits its stride. Clark Kent (Henry Cavill a good choice for Superman solid sturdy fairly anonymous) is a twentysomething wanderer uneasy with his powers. Rather than leading us through his whole life so far Snyder tells the tale of Kent reconnecting with his past finding the super-suit (unshiny like the movie) and testing his powers while often flashing back to his childhood. Soon journalist Lois Lane (Amy Adams) knows whats up. Adamss character is different to the Margot Kidder version shes a tough-cookie investigator and not the sort to be hoodwinked by a pair of thick-rimmed glasses and a comb-over. Mostly this Superman is more action than angst. But those daddy issues are still in play. Crowe - never an actor to show his ticklish side - plays Jor-El like hes Hamlets father. Kevin Costner is Supermans Earth dad in pastoral scenes full of cornfields clothes on the line and snapshots of an easier time which look like they were conceived soon after a screening of Terrence Malicks The Tree of Life. At times you wish for a quick dash into a phone box and a cat that needs rescuing from a tree. Snyder is no party pooper though. He might not resurrect Supermans old theme tune nor does he allow the word Superman to be spoken (its all Clark and Kal). But by the end hes teased in some of the more amusing elements of the old story we thought were missing leaving the way open for a sequel that will surely be more Earthbound.

I grew up on the Reeve films and what Man Of Steel did was absolutely spot on it left it (the Reeve films) behind its its own entity which is what was needed. Superman Returns was sweet for its homage the plane scene i the baseball field was great but it was a love note to the past with some great moments and some very quiet others. Man of Steel has been cited as too much action total destruction of the city was too much and not in keeping with the comics and what they stand for...wrong. Take a look back to the very late 60s issues and youll find mass destruction right there on the cover of one key issue Not everyone knows the back story people who say this are living this for themselves which is crazy the only way these stories survive is to enter the mindset of the next generation to take them on further. Kids that have been born in the last ten years etc are only really seeing him for the first time this is their Reeve which is just great especially when youve got people like Shannon as their first villain too This movie was made for the fans by fans made for kids through to grandparents which is just how it should be. No the Superman theme as we know it wasnt there but instead was a heart pounding substitute that filled my senses every time i heard it (how many times did i watch the trailer online just to hear the score? Wow. No this movie wasnt the Reeve version it was something else...something great. At 42 ive read and been into all kinds of movies comics shows etc slowly becoming jaded at somethings having seen so much im even more of a Batfan than i am a Superfan but my anticipation along with a friend who is a Superfan was at an all time high prior to the movie coming out and we were rewarded with an absolute treat. I saw it twice in a week. Snyder offers up another film worthy of comic book fans old and new i loved the Watchmen I loved 300 and i will wait with more anticipation for the new movie with the Worlds Finest included. Snyder offers up popcorn with drama action and heart which is what the comics have always been about so a huge thanks goes to him and his team. Hes provided a movie among others that i could only dream of being made when i was a boy then a teenager.

The first part was pretty good with regard to plot although the constant flashback sequences were a bit hard to follow. The second part of nonstop ridiculous action was about the worst Ive ever seen. There were two or three times during this action sequence or whatever you call it that I was crying out for the movie to end.

It was clever it was intersting and it dealt with some really interesting issues which had never been seen in a Superman film before. However as soon as the action started the film became tedious and boring. Gone was the emotional story replaced by invincible Kryptonians being piledrived into buildings over and over again for about 45 minutes. This completely ruined the film for me and by the end all I could think of was that awful last act as opposed to the incredibly well done first two acts.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJun 24 2013Clarke KentFeaturedAs a fan of the Superman franchise I was extremely disappointed. Lengthy boring back story when everyone knows the story. Massive reliance on the latest CGI development. How many more Super Hero Movies do I have to sit through where half of the film is the extensive destruction of a nondescript city. Its BORING The best things about this film.....Henry Chabrol. And as always a solid performance from Russell Crowe. I will not be buying this one on DVD.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJun 23 2013critiqueFeaturedFirst-rate action movie with superbly choreographed combat sequences.

You will hate General Zodd from the moment you see him (that makes a film a lot better) the fight scenes just get better over time becoming more futuristic. Lois Lane has a big impact too. I Love this film and will defiantly get the DVD. 4 1/2 stars WATCH IT NOWFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJun 22 2013DimitrisFeaturedHenry Cavill proves to be a good choice for the role of Superman. He may not be a great actor but he has the right appearance and voice. The action sequences are frequent long and impressive. A Superman movie needs to have a lot of destruction and this is what you get here. Also the visual effects and the overall design are well made. There are several drawbacks though Amy Adams is a forgettable Lois Lane characters are not developped and the story lacks dramatic tension and originality. Still if you are a fan of super hero movies you should not miss this.

OK a few gripes aside there is a feeling of awe and delight when Kalel finally dons the cape and flies around and Cavill plays a very convincing lead struggling to Cary the weight of the world on his shoulders. OK the final 40 minutes turn into a slam fest which we saw last year in Avengers Assemble but this really has more depth and seriousness. My favourite scenes were actually Costners especially the hurricane moment which brought a lump in my throat. What people forget is that a man becomes his true person by how he has been raised and this resonates perfectly in Man of Steel. The real savoirs are the Kents by raising Clarke how they did and that has never been so expertly executed in a Superman film until now.

Singer tried and failed by giving us an overly referential so-called sequel with dull performances; then there were hopes that Zack Snyder would disinfect the said snoozefest from our memories with a Suoerman to stand along side the Donner version. The film has its moments Performances were great - as too were the scenes involving Costner and Lane; Cavill fitted the role perfectly with his chiselled profile to his over-inflated physique; and Michael Shannon was his usual loopy self. Hans Zimmer even dared to apply his own hand at Supermans musical legacy; while not being entirely memorable fitted the movies aesthetic. The flying sequences were at times frenetic; whilst Chris Reeve showed us the elegance of his wire-pulled balletics whilst Cavills came across as Mighty Mouse caught in a pinball machine. The film in the third act had too much going on a noisy cluster of falling buildings and explosions being one of them (was expecting Optimus Prime to turn up at one point). Well Richard Donner can sleep at night yet again. Maybe for the inevitable sequel we will find David.SGoyer and Zack Snyder (If he returns) will concentrate more on character whilst turning the explosions down a notch.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJun 16 2013JayFeaturedFor a lot of those of my generation who witnessed the brilliance of Richard Donners original now irrevocably embedded in our minds to sit through Zack Snyders over-laden visual effects showreel it just misses the mark in some places but can remain an enjoyable action flick to totally forgettable. Henry Cavill was perfectly cast with his chisel-jawed good looks to his overly inflated body; Amy Adams was a vast improvement over the dull persona Kate Bosworth gave us in Singers version. As with Donners version it took its time; you cared about the characters with an emotional epicenter that carried the film along - aptly so by John Williamss untimely music. Here we really couldnt care a less about the characters (although the scenes involving Diane Lane Kevin Costner were the standout). Chris Reeve was more balletic on his flying harness whilst Cavill was like mighty mouse caught in a ping-pong machine. That said i enjoyed the movie; Hans Zimmers score was very good (even if it was at times written for another movie) and Michael Shannon - the standout here - was his perfect loopy self. That body armour was unnecessary It seems yet again that Dick Donner can sleep easy at night - unless of course Man Of Steel 2 will prove us wrong...Oh well.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJun 16 2013careyFeaturedThis reviewer included that it is ""fun""...mustve dozed off I dont remember anything remotely fun. Movie needed a major re-write. Zero humor story is muddled not to mention revisionist of basic original storyline. But lots of explosions and amazing special effects. From reading all the fan comments that seems to be what passes for ""amazing"" and ""awesome"" film making today. Big swing and miss IMHO.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJun 16 2013Justin BerkoviFeaturedThis is pretty much how everything can go wrong with a comic or superhero adaptation in cinema. The story and plot was completely disjointed there was no proper character development but worse the entire film ends up just as one CGI blow em up orgy after another. Its a HUGE disappointment. Its almost as if the cast were embarased to say superman in the film and when the legacy is explored its almost mocked or ridiculed. A tragedy of a film. AvoidFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJun 15 2013IanFeaturedI enjoyed this a lot despite Snyders direction. It is too loud too many explosions there is far to much strobe lighting and unnecessary flying of objects at you to justify the extra for the 3D. When will Directors learn that just because you can do something doesnt mean that you have to? The long final fight scene strikes me as an excuse for Snyder to show off his love of destruction and violence as the protagonists fight over New York. Like Abrams Star Trek film this shows that some of money spent on effects should have gone on the scrip and characterisation. The acting is generally very good when you can hear it over the background noise and explosions. A four star film despite the director not because of him.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/london/film/man-of-steel?intcid=leader,200,manofsteel42,manofsteel,timeout

Entertainment Inc. and Legendary Pictures Funding Zack Snyders Man of Steel is a movie event with an actual movie inside crying to get out. Despite its preposterous self-seriousness its overblown CGIed-to-death climax and its desperate efforts to depict the destruction of well everything on Earth theres greatness in this retelling of the origin of Superman moments of intimate grandeur some marvelous subtle acting and a superhero costume thats a feat of mad mod genius. Theres almost a story here. And the actors including the pictures quietly dazzling star Henry Cavill do their damnedest to draw it out. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - But theres just no stopping what comic-book movies have become especially those bearing the royal seal of Dark Knight auteur Christopher Nolan. (Hes one of Man of Steels producers and also helped develop the story.) These movies are no longer driven by characters though they feature some of the best-loved figures in the universe (whether its Marvels or in this case DCs). Theyre all about plot mechanics and increasingly elaborate special effects though they pretend to tangle with the serious life-and-death issues that end up being these movies big bugaboo. In Man of Steel the titan in the red cape doing everything in his power to save humanity is almost a distraction from the movies larger mission to impress us with its vague lofty ideals and attention to detail. See Also Superman Movies Matter More Than the ComicsFilm Details Man of Steel RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time143 More Info Trailer The press notes for instance tell us that a linguist who uses invented languages like Klingon and Navi as a teaching tool helped the filmmakers develop 300 distinct Kryptonian words and phrases. So now we learn that that letter ""S"" fitted neatly into triangular shield which little kids since the 1930s have recognized as the international symbol of Superman is really the Kryptonian glyph for ""hope."" Who knew? Superhero movies are now so bogged down in detail they barely need superheroes anymore--much less real people.Yet Cavill and his co-stars Amy Adams Diane Lane and Kevin Costner soldier on turning Man of Steel into something thats almost great even when its not very good. The plot goes something like this Realizing their planet Krypton is dying and knowing that its bigwig military leader General Zod (Michael Shannon) is up to no good upstanding citizen Jor-El (a preoccupied-looking Russell Crowe) and his wife Lara (Ayelet Zurer) blast their diaperless newborn into space. Zod kills Jor-El--though like Hamlets ghost he gets several convenient reappearances--and Lara dies shortly thereafter. When next we see orphaned Baby Kal-El hes a grown-up with a beard a drifter working on a fishing boat. His name is now Clark and he has superhuman powers but he also carries much pain. Still there is hope or as we must now properly call it ""S.""Clarks adoptive parents Martha and Jonathan Kent (Lane and Costner) of Smallville Kansas have done all they can to prepare their son for the world. But they dont know that Zod having nursed a beef with Jor-El for several thousand years (or something like that) is headed to Earth to destroy their son. Meanwhile Daily Planet reporter Lois Lane travels to the Arctic and suffers a stomach wound. Luckily she also meets a mysterious hunk who can cauterize said wound with his eyes. ""This is going to hurt"" he tells her and hes right--she screams as the shot fades.A little disturbing and intensely erotic that petite mort is one of the most striking moments in Man of Steel. For an instant the movie forgets that its invented a whole new language and instead uses good old-fashioned storytelling tools. But mostly Man of Steel is preoccupied with its own spectacle. Theres so much heaviness here that ironically nothing seems to have its own weight. And once Shannons Zod shows up on Earth with his dumb little goatee you know this super-engineered movie experience is just going to get bigger and emptier.Does the destruction of New York City or its stand-in Metropolis even require a spoiler alert anymore? If you think it does stop reading here. If youve seen it all before--and you have--you wont be surprised to learn that huge swathes of the city are destroyed 9/11-style at the hands of General Zod and his destructo-spaceship. (It hovers menacingly over the skyline like a malevolent gray lobster with three pincers.) At the end of the ordeal three survivors climb from the rubble with dusty faces essentially saying ""Whew That was a close call."" But weve already seen sidewalks and streets buckling and caving skyscrapers folding in upon themselves hordes of people running for their lives. Thousands of citizens must have died and yet the manufactured horror weve just witnessed is suddenly rendered weightless. Thats because comic-book movies arent real silly--except when theyre totally serious.And Man of Steel is plenty serious. The MacGuffin here is a precious thingamabob holding the DNA codes for an entire race. How can anyone watching Man of Steel keep a straight face when a character asks solemnly ""Where is the Codex?"" I wanted to yell out ""Aisle 9 right next to the Stay-Free.""Its a relief just to watch the actors act once in a while and thankfully Snyder is astute enough to punch some breathing holes in this steel-clad colossus. Adams is a fine no-nonsense Lois Lane; she makes nosiness sultry. And Costner and Lane in their depiction of heartland parents defy the idea of homespun coziness taking corn-pone dialogue and turning it golden. Lane has an extraordinary moment when shes called to the school to calm down the preadolescent Clark whos had a meltdown after realizing he can see through his classmates and teachers skin. (You would too.) She talks to him through the closet hes locked himself into. ""The world is too big Mom"" he says an instance of kid overstatement that in this case is perfectly justified. ""Then make it small"" she tells him. ""Focus on my voice."" If you were a young Superman in training Lanes sturdy brand of reassurance is just what youd want to hear.No wonder this pensive angst-ridden kid grows up to be Henry Cavill so cautiously grounded he at first seems inexpressive. It took me a scene or two to warm to him maybe because I still miss Christopher Reeve and his far-less-tricked-out pecs. But Cavill grounds the movie. His Superman is more a listener than a talker. Thats probably what happens when you have X-ray vision and you can see Cavill soaking it all in.That quality serves him well even when hes flying. In the movies finest scene where hes just learning the ropes of taking off hes more bird than plane reading the signals around him as a Canada goose or a barn swallow might. Superman gets his wings in the Arctic. Its a fine and desolate setting for human flight and a smashing one for his particular uniform His cape is light and lofty with a fine velvety texture--it ripples in the wind like an alert flag. And no sooner have his red boots touched down in the soft crunchy snow than theyre off again. This is costuming that allows an actor to defy gravity if only in the make-believe way.Much later Clark Kent tired of blurring his identity on fishing boats and Arctic explorations will mount a truly impossible feat a career as a journalist. And yet Cavill looks just as human in his Superman suit as he does in his newspapermans uniform with his laptop bag and nerd glasses. This Man of Steel is still faster than a speeding bullet and more powerful than a locomotive. But even more miraculously he humanizes the gargantuan movie around him. Its his Kryptonite and still he defies it.Follow VoiceFilmClub2 Photo by Clay Enos - (c) 2013 Warner Bros.

Pictures Henry Cavill as Superman in ""Man of Steel."" By CHRIS VOGNAR cvognardallasnews.com Movie Critic Published 10 June 2013 1030 PM Updated 12 June 2013 0245 PM Related Reel Genius on Man of Steel A Superman movie thats grim is contradictory incredibly problematic Summer Movie Guide See whats hitting screens from now until August Failed movie magic Five films to avoid at theaters this week Must-see movies Five films to check out in theaters this week Much like its noble sculpted hero Man of Steel finds itself caught between two identities two sets of purposes. Where the anguished Superman (the appropriately square-jawed blue-eyed Henry Cavill) is torn between the superior might of his native Krypton and the needy folks of his adopted Earth the movie cant decide if it wants to be a particularly thoughtful brand of superhero saga or a deafeningly generic summer action movie.So it ends up being both to the detriment of it and us.For at least its first half Man of Steel stakes its claim as a confident and psychologically complex sci-fi origins legend layered with flashbacks and just the right amount of existential torment. We see Clark Kent as a bullied boy who knows hes different and we see him as a young man adrift in lonely locales far from the heartland home of his Earth parents (a well-cast Kevin Costner and Diane Lane) and even farther from his birth father (Russell Crowe). The saturated metallic look accentuates his otherworldliness and the dark shards of realism remind us that Christopher Nolan is on board as a writer producer and conduit of Dark Knight pedigree.But Man of Steel has another master to serve the Mammon of the summer blockbuster and all of the rote mayhem that entails. When Man of Steel gets dumb and predictable it does so faster than a speeding bullet. The showdown between the benevolent blue-suited alien who goes by Kal-El and his Krypton nemesis General Zod (Michael Shannon) goes on for an eternity and gets stuffed with the kind of detailed nonsense that weighs down lesser movies of this ilk. One building crumbles then another. One climax leads to another then another. Its as if Man of Steel suddenly remembered an obligation to compete with the Transformers and Avengers franchises.Some will say the spilt personality marks the difference between Nolan and director Zack Snyder but thats too easy. Snyders name is front and center on the Man of Steel credits so give him the bulk of the credit and the blame and keep this in mind Hollywoods aversion to risk takes on superhuman dimensions once summertime rolls around. Creating a product to please every possible ticket buyer is a way to guarantee a movie at war with itself.That wars primary casualty is the man of steel himself the rare superhero who deserves the ""iconic"" descriptor. Man of Steel sets him up to be more intriguing than hes ever been on screen a sensitive misfit feared and hunted by the world that needs him. The movie has the gumption to dispose of the hidden identity highjinks between Clark/Superman and Lois Lane (Amy Adams). It takes some smart chances.Then it squanders them. It seems leaping tall buildings in a single bound is kid stuff next to the task of unshackling Superman from dominant blockbuster formulas. Not to get misty-eyed about it but something is wrong when the most classic of comic-book creations becomes just another cog in the machine. In some dark corner of the city Lex Luthor unleashes a maniacal laugh.Follow Chris Vognar on Twitter at chrisvognar.MAN OF STEEL (B-)Directed by Zack Snyder.

Photo I grew up in Kansas says the dimpled superhero of the unabashedly crowd-pleasing blockbuster ""Man of Steel as he faces attempted rendition as an enemy alien. ""Im as American as they come. Deploying an impeccable American accent Brit Henry Cavill may be as charming as the late great Christopher Reeve -- or Reeves unfortunate doppelganger Brandon Routh who donned a more traditional Superman costume in ""Superman Returns an underrated attempt to reboot the franchise seven years ago. Neither Cavills Superman nor his alter ego Clark Kent are required to turn on much charm in whats definitely not your father or your mothers Man of Steel movie. Like producer and co-story writer Christopher Nolans ""The Dark Knight -- and dare we say it any number of films spun off from the rival Marvel Universe -- this is a darker and more angsty take on the classic DC Comics character with lots more of the kind of action that fans have come to expect. RELATED HOW THE FILMMAKERS MADE A DARKER SUPERMAN In fact without really giving anything away the last 45 minutes of ""Man of Steel seem like a deliberate and quite successful attempt to top the sheer destruction wreaked on Manhattan in the climax of ""Marvels The Avengers (called of course Metropolis here). The special effects are better too. ""Man of Steel wipes the slate clean and begins again with a new version of the origin story taking advantage of 35 years of advances in special effects and the bigger pool of Oscar winners and nominees available for superhero movies. Beginning with the birth of Kal-El (finally ending all speculation about whether Superman is circumcised) the film pits Russell Crowe (in very good form) as his dad Jor-El Kryptons foremost scientist against the evil General Zod (a splendid Michael Shannon) who ends up getting expelled into the Phantom Zone with his minions. Baby Kal-El is sent to Earth in a rocket -- the retro-futuristic designs owe a tremendous debt to ""Alien -- as his parents die in the destruction of Krypton though the spirit of Jor-El is brought back for more expository curtain calls than the ghost of Hamlets father. RELATED MEET KRYPTONS SEXY NEW VILLAIN Clark Kent is first seen making a rescue from a flaming oil platform at sea. There are then multiple flashbacks to his troubled childhood and adolescence where hes tormented by his superpowers. Diane Lane plays his understanding mother and Kevin Costner his wise farmer dad who advises his adopted son to hide his powers to avoid scaring Earthlings -- which has unfortunate personal consequences during a tornado that way outdoes anything youre going to see outside of a special edition of ""Storm Chasers. Lois Lane (Amy Adams) who still works at the Daily Planet first encounters Supe somewhere on assignment in the Arctic. But they dont lock lips till they foil a convoluted plot by General Zod -- the second defrosted super villain in the last month if youre keeping track (Khan in ""Star Trek"" is the other) -- to turn Earth into a second Krypton. Ive not been a fan of director Zack Snyder (""Sucker Punch) in the past but under Nolans supervision he largely lays off the ADD editing and does a highly respectable and sometimes inspired job of retooling the basic Superman mythology in ""Man of Steel. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Top Songwriters Hall of Fame honorees reveal the stories b...

Pictures Theres big and then theres this Superman (but dont call him that). TWITTER Zack Snyders Superman reboot stars Henry Cavill Amy Adams Michael Shannon Kevin Costner and Russell Crowe. To the oft-asked question of whether or not the world is really starving for yet another superhero origin story Man of Steel simply responds by serving up what could be as much spectacle and action -- minute-by-minute frame-by-frame -- as any movie anyone could think of. Zack Snyders huge backstory-heavy extravaganza is a rehab job that perhaps didnt cry out to be done but proves so overwhelmingly insistent in its size and strength that its hard not to give in. Warner Bros. new tentpole should remain firmly planted around the world for much of the summer. With Christopher Nolans mammoth Batman trilogy having wrapped up last year the quick return of the other great DC comic hero was inevitable even if the last attempt Bryan Singers Superman Returns (2006) only lasted one lap. Nolans involvement here as a producer and co-story writer with David S. Goyer his collaborator on all three Batman films will encourage fans to look closely for his fingerprints and a first impression might suggest his hand in deepening the heros roots to such a serious extent and insisting upon using Hans Zimmer to compose the score. Visually and rhythmically however Snyder has gone his own way summoning up memories of Dune in the sculpted architectural look of Krypton echoing Jesus by underlining the sacrifice Clark Kent is called upon to make for the good of mankind and simply by hardly letting five minutes go by without inventing some new excuse for a staggering action scene -- any one of which undoubtedly cost more than the combined budgets of all of this years Sundance competition lineup. PHOTOS 26 of Summers Most Anticipated Movies Man of Steel Wolverine The Lone Ranger Even the inevitably expository first 18 minutes on Krypton are spiked with an amazing amount of visual stimulation. As Jor-El (Russell Crowe) lays it all out about the planets road to ruin its failed intergalactic colonization efforts and his discovery of a planet to which he can send his little son were witness to both large-scale calamity and the intimate treachery of the rebellious General Zod (a ferocious Michael Shannon) whose murderous campaign gets him packed off to the deep space equivalent of Siberia. Snyder doesnt miss a beat once the tale spins down to Earth. Scarcely has Kal-El emerged from his projectile after a long flight when he rescues workers from a burning oil rig. The youngster later sees his classmates in disturbing X-ray vision and not long after the renamed Clark Kent asks his adoptive mother (Diane Lane) ""Whats wrong with me Mom?"" a parade of topless shots of the young man reveal far from anything wrong but rather that the actor playing him Henry Cavill would have been fully qualified for a major role in Snyders 300 without any digital musculature added. When Clark saves the day yet again by lifting a school bus out of the water after its gone off a bridge his adoptive father (Kevin Costner) realizes its time for a heart-to-heart. ""Youre the answer to whether were alone in the universe"" he confides upon showing Clark the old pod that brought him to Earth. PHOTOS Superman Turns 75 The Man of Steels Legacy in Pictures At the same time ace Daily Planet reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams) gets on to a story about a foreign object thats been buried in ice for 20000 years while Jor-El abruptly rematerializes to teach his sprig more Kryptonian history and present him with his long-awaited suit and cape so he can begin his entertainingly staged flying lessons. For a film that has thus far spent an hour basically setting the table writer Goyer and Snyder have found a way to sneak in at least a half-dozen big-time action sequences. Suddenly there are two more a Midwestern twister big enough to send not just a house but a whole town to Oz and the spectacular spaceship arrival of Zod who breaks Kal-El/Clarks cover by giving him 24 hours to surrender. Here the Jesus parallel asserts itself especially when its stressed that Kal-El has spent 33 years on Earth anonymously before being asked to sacrifice himself. Not much more is made of this but the subtext persists. When a real-time action sequence cant be generated narratively Kal-El experiences a nightmare vision of the Kryptonian dystopia Zod would impose upon Earth which provokes him to attack the general in what is wittily staged as an old-fashioned Main Street showdown in Smallville. By now its clear that Snyders and Goyers intention is to have no downtime at all just spectacle on top of spectacle. In enormous effects-driven films this is often a counterproductive approach in that it can either have a numbing deadening effect as in the Transformers series or terminally suffer from a strained attempt to keep topping itself scene after scene as in the last Indiana Jones adventure. Although it does go over the top toward the end when Zod embraces a genocidal program and attacks Kal-El with giant metallic tentacles that are more ridiculous than scary Man of Steel mostly plays it smart by mixing its action deck-of-cards style. PHOTOS 10 Top Summer Superheroes Movies Of All Time Battle of Box Office Brawn Given the almost relentless pursuit of big scenes Man of Steel manages to find the time to develop a reasonably plausible relationship between Kal-El and Lois Lane who must balance her compulsion to deliver the scoop of the century with the suspicion shared by the aliens adoptive father that the world is not ready for the likes of this superman (Superman? Does anyone here say ""Superman""? Barely.) This is a smart active modern Lois one who does need to be rescued on occasion but is always keen to be in the thick of things. Adams and Cavill develop a spirited rapport thats enjoyable to watch in admittedly short spurts. Visually Snyder and cinematographer Amir Mokri employ handheld shots noticeably more than is the norm in such megaproductions and the very tight short-focused shots of the heros face while flying have an unexpectedly intimate nature quite beautiful in their way. The effects which course through the film without cease are not as consistently sharp as they normally were in Nolans Batman trilogy veering from the expert to the video-gamey to the borderline cheesy albeit charmingly so. Becomingly modest in the characters low-key early scenes and gradually reveling in his power Cavill has a pleasing presence that makes him easy to accept as Kal-El accepts the extraordinary fate that has been prescribed for him. Snarling scarred and not without a worthy villains righteous logic Shannon excels as the fearsome Zod. Other major names are well cast and used down the line including Costner Lane Crowe Laurence Fishburne as Loiss editor and Antje Traue as Zods relentless ninja-style warrior partner. Working in a somewhat lower key than was his norm for Nolan Zimmer still provides the musical grandeur and sense of portent that lends the film an extra dimension. Opens June 14 (Warner Bros.)

Theres nary a mention of kryptonite the Fortress of Solitude is only an existential locale and Clark Kent never earns so much as a single Daily Planet byline in ""Man of Steel"" director Zack Snyder writer David S. Goyer and producer Christopher Nolans strenuously revisionist Superman origin story which might more accurately have been titled ""Rock Em Sock Em Spacemen"" given the amount of screen time devoted to exiled Kryptonians body-slamming each other into all manner of natural and manmade structures. Clearly designed to do for DC Comics other most venerable property what Nolan and Goyers ""Batman Begins"" did for the Caped Crusader this heavily hyped brilliantly marketed tentpole attraction seems destined to soar with worldwide audiences this summer even if the humorless tone and relentlessly noisy (visually and sonically) aesthetics leave much to be desired -- chiefly a ""Steel"" sequel directed with less of an iron fist.This story first appeared in the June 11 2013 issue of Variety. Subscribe today.See more. Where the red-booted ones last bigscreen appearance Bryan Singers 2006 ""Superman Returns"" was conceived as a mash note to Richard Donners iconic 1978 ""Superman"" Snyder Goyer and Nolan (who also shares a story credit) labor to distance ""Man of Steel"" from those precursors starting with a Krypton that looks less like an ice castle in the sky than a grayer grimier version of ""Avatars"" Pandora (by way of ""Alien""). There the noble scientist Jor-El (Russell Crowe) plots to spirit his newborn son Kal-El away from the dying planet -- a plan that coincides with a military coup staged by the rogue Gen. Zod (Michael Shannon sporting a most unflattering bowl cut). That sequence sets the tone for much of what follows in ""Man of Steel"" with Hans Zimmers thunderous score rattling both speakers and eardrums the actors dwarfed by layer upon layer of crumbling buildings and warring spacecraft. SEE ALSO ""Man of Steel"" on Track for 100 Million Debut After Zod and his accomplices are caught theyre frozen solid and banished to a black-hole Siberia just before Krypton itself goes kaboom. ""Man of Steel"" then breaks from a linear timeline to jump ahead some 33 years where we find the adult Clark (Henry Cavill) working as a grunt on a commercial fishing trawler not yet having revealed his superego to the world but occasionally dabbling in large-scale heroics nonetheless. When a nearby oil rig is engulfed in a fiery blaze he barges in to rescue the crew then just as quickly disappears before anyone can ask too many questions. As in ""Batman Begins"" (which opened with a wayward Bruce Wayne wandering the earth like ""Kung Fus"" Caine) these are supposed to be Clark/Kals years in the wilderness grappling with daddy issues and an amorphous sense of self as he bounces from place to place and one odd job to the next. Pic also adopts a similar flashback structure in which present events trigger memories of Clarks past as the adopted son of Illinois farm folk Jonathan (a touching Kevin Costner) and Martha (Diane Lane) Kent as a loner/outcast bullied by schoolmates and as a superhero-to-be coming to terms with his alien heritage and powerful gifts. But even here Snyder seems averse to staging a single scene in which there isnt something catastrophic happening whether its a schoolbus accident that plunges Clark and his classmates into a raging ravine or the entire Kent family finding itself stranded on a highway in the path of an oncoming twister. Things finally snap into sharper focus for Clark when he follows news reports of a strange ""anomalous object"" to a NORAD outpost somewhere in the Arctic and via a little Kryptonian hocus-pocus communes with the holographic consciousness of his birth father (who narrates a brief animated history of the rise and fall of Krypton drawn in striking Soviet propaganda-art style). Its there at just around the 50-minute mark that Clark first dons the trademark ""S"" suit and also where he first encounters Lois Lane (Amy Adams) this time a Pulitzer Prize-winning hard-news reporter who uses her journalistic acumen to quickly deduce Supes secret identity. But rather than moving logically on to Metropolis ""Man of Steel"" somewhat curiously dovetails back to Smallville where Clarks reunion with dear old mum is interrupted by the arrival of Zod. Newly freed from his interstellar limbo he threatens to make haste with all of humanity unless Clark/Kal surrenders both himself and a coveted ""Codex"" that can be used to rebuild Krypton ... on Earth. WATCH the Final ""Man of Steel"" Teaser (VIDEO) So far so gloomy with little of the genuine wonderment the very name ""Superman"" calls to mind. Blessed with the most classically chiseled jawline of any actor whos yet donned the red cape Cavill is also the most dour and brooding lacking even the sardonic self-amusement of Christian Bale in Bruce Wayne mode -- and he appears to have been directed to be exactly this way. Like its lead Snyders entire movie seems afraid to crack a smile. The ambition to make a grittier kind of Superman pic is certainly admirable but much of what Snyder and Goyer set out to fix wasnt really broken in the first place. By having Lois discover Clarks true identity so early on ""Man of Steel"" relinquishes the halting romantic chemistry between the two characters that brightened previous versions of the tale. And the narrow focus on Clark Lois and Zod gives the movie an oddly circumscribed feel. Nowhere to be found is the rich gallery of colorful supporting players that populated the Donner film Nolans ""Batman"" pics and Snyders own ""Watchmen"" (one of the richest and most satisfying of all comicbook adaptations). Gone too are any of those lighter moments fondly remembered from Supermen past  in which our hero -- in or out of disguise -- used his powers for decidedly non-super feats and by doing so grew closer to his fellow man. One longs to see this Superman change a flat or rescue a kitten from a tree or take Lois for a flight around the block. Instead we get two climactic rumbles -- one on the streets of Smallville one (finally) in downtown Metropolis -- that test ones patience for blurs of movement smashing through buildings with little if any respect for the laws of physics. Indeed if ""Man of Steel"" doesnt much look like previous ""Superman"" movies it does closely resemble such other recent sci-fi/fantasy pics like ""Thor"" ""The Avengers"" and ""Transformers"" and their symphonies of disorienting CGI destruction. At points the action scenes even recall the hallucinogenic dream sequences from Snyders own crazily ambitious mental-hospital musical ""Sucker Punch"" except everyone here is supposed to be wide awake. Pic is undeniably impressive in the sense that little if any expense has been spared in bringing Snyders vision to the screen though this is a case where less would almost surely have been more. Much of the craft work exudes the same general feeling of overkill from the frantic handheld shooting and desaturated colors of lenser Amir Mokri to the unceasing Wagnerian bombast of Zimmers score.

At a minimum the film is 35 minutes too long. Reply Michael Faye says July 10 2013 at 245 am I have been a Superman fan since 1953. Everyone has the right to produce their own interpretation. I have read a lot of bad reviews and was expecting the worst. The effects are the best possible. The film drags at times but mostly action. My thoughts are the S on the back of the cape is gone and it gives Superman a Roman Gladiator look. The biggest negitive on this film is the music or lack of. Superman is synonymous with a strong music score. In this respect it is a flop as the music is neither memorable or impressionable. This is a huge negative on the film and was the culprit in the lack of excitement. Zack listen up from someone who know. Trust me. Reply J.D. says July 4 2013 at 546 pm A bit of levity combined with small moments like saving a cat would have made this a great film. And there were completely missed opportunities. For example theres a shot of shopkeepers in Smallville running indoors to avoid an early battle between Superman and Zod and we see the sign on the door reading ""OPEN"". Just a quick shot of the storekeeper flipping it around to the ""CLOSED"" side would have been a touch of levity to balance the explosive fight that follows. And recall the scene where Superman crashes into the IHOP and sees his now-grown-up but still tubby classmate staring on in shock. Superman looks at him but they say nothing. Why even bother having him there? Since theyre both in the scene and theres a small break in the action Superman should have quipped ""Hey Pete""... and then continued the battle. Its that type of characterization that makes us like the character of Superman. Hes an alien but hes also always trying to be human even if its awkward. That type of levity would have balanced out the action and would have colored in Supermans character. Finally the scene at the end where Superman says ""Im from Kansas That about as American as you can get"" is a scene that will probably not be shown overseas. But its ridiculous anyhow and only speaks to how much the script failed to illustrate Supermans character. This is film SHOW dont tell. By the end of the film we should already know that Superman is ""as American as [he] can get."" And this could have been done through simple visuals. I believe theres a scene in a Reeves film where theres a fight on the moon and the American flag gets knocked over. Superman makes a point of putting it back up. We see he priorities and love for America with no words needed. Something like that could have happened here right after they fight around the satellite -- they could have gone higher and fought on the moon for a second knock over the flag etc. But Supermans lame statement is a product of poor script-writing. There was horrible dialogue throughout. Another example Zod repeating himself a number of times in the final fight sequence culminating in ""Theres only one way this ends Either I die or you die"" Ugh no crap. But show it make me feel that. Dont have a character tell me what I should be expecting. On the plus side the action sequences were pretty impressive. The choreographers understood what the creators of the Amazing Spiderman did not -- we want to see the main character maximize the use of his environs and we want to see it from as many angles as possible. The fight between the buildings between Superman and Zod was excellent. By contrast every shot in Spiderman seemed to be at the same distance -- a medium shot. Over and over. No real effort to show him webbing his way through the city. Yeah there was one little scene of it towards the end but the camera work was stiff and always a medium shot. Fortunately the creators of Superman understood that the camera must follow the lead wherever he goes no matter how fast. Reply TML says July 4 2013 at 1156 pm Just a quick note the ""Im from Kansas"" -scene was shown abroad at least in Finland. Reply J.D. says July 5 2013 at 125 pm Interesting. Thats better than what happened with the last Superman film where they couldnt have Perry White say ""Truth justice and the American way"" and instead had him say ""Truth justice...and all that stuff"" -- even in the American version. But if Superman is portrayed as embodying the American spirit even overseas then they had no excuse not to make it obvious that he was ""as American as it gets"" in earlier scenes. I suspect there was some debate about that during the filming process. Better Than You says July 2 2013 at 834 pm An awful awful film. Plodding over-serious distant-galaxy shit descends into a masturbatory fantasia on 9/11. The only redemption was provided by the most laughable line ever delivered - ""how do I know you wont one day turn against Americas interests?"" Reply Lois Holbrook says June 30 2013 at 132 am Best action Movie to date with empathy courage  and a story that shows real human interest .. PLUS the best visuals one would ever hope to see(.as . Zack Snyders. usually are. .NY POST got it right when they said the visuals were better than the Avengers and the last scene was better also. Plus the Big Blue Boy Scout became real and approachable like the rest of usThank the Lord for this movie which restored my faith in Hollywood. They finally made an action movie with modern technology and yes basic values which made America great Thank you Chris Zack and the others.........Best Lois H. Reply Frank Masiello says June 28 2013 at 625 pm In 1978 audiences were awed by a big-budget wonderful adaptation of the comic books. The resulting franchise started showing annoying degradations of cinematic quality and embarrassing attempts at humor immediately in SII. The next two films went from bad to worst ever. In 2006 an homage to that first film was deemed a misfire though many enjoyed Superman Returns and hoped to see where the new son storyline would go in sequels that were never made. The main criticism is it did not have enough fighting. What Zack Snyder did was a thorough reboot and the film is successful in its execution. Since it is fashionable to ""criticize"" super-hero movies the film has to be picked on for something so this time it is its serious tone (a critique that will never haunt any of next falls Oscar contenders of course). In other words critics and even many fans look for things to think are somehow wrong Hes a boyscout (Reeve) hes too sensitive (Routh)  hes too serious (Cavill). What audiences are getting is aside from state-of-the-art effects and interesting new spins on the relationship with the Kents and Lois Lane the most physically perfect Superman actor who ever donned the costume. Cavill looks AMAZING and acts stoic and soul-searching (deliberate parts of the new interpretation). The children playing young Clark are troubled even sad. The adult Clark smiles many times when appropriate like during his interview when he first appears as Clark the reporter and when he is practically giddy with joy for first finding out his Kryptonian heritage. That we see a character who is good and kind and forgiving is an inspiration for those of us who would like to be-in some way-like Superman. Reply TML says June 27 2013 at 240 pm I disagree with well everything there is to disagree with in this review. Someone was looking for an apple and found a pear. Well boo-hoo. I think this was a more realistic portrayal of what someone like Superman would be like. I think its relatively ridiculous to think Superman would actually be like what hes portrayed as usually. Seriosuly? Youre (usually) the only one left of your race youre totally different from others you have to protect EVERYONE and still youre all happy joy joy heres your kitten from that tree? Really? As to the Lois/Clark pace well I for one am glad as hell we skip that Spider-Man will-it-ever-end specualation as to who that masked hero is. The pace in Man of Steel was great the music as epic as Superman deserves the destruction as it should be all strength considered (respect for the laws of physics really? Observe http//youtu.be/V-fL8zopddI ) and Cavill was fantastic. Id say a negative point is that we have to wait even a year for a sequel. Reply John Allen Small says June 27 2013 at 326 pm I disagree with well everything there is to disagree with in your response to this article. Nuff said. Reply Kory Stephens says June 29 2013 at 906 am Indeed TML says June 27 2013 at 1008 pm Fair enough. lad says June 25 2013 at 536 pm Man of Steel was not made to cater only to comic book fans which I am not but to the public in general and especially to children. This was suppose to be entertaining and it was. All these people that are shredding the movie with mindless picky critiques are just taking all the fun out of summer. Wake up its just a movie. Oh and by the way read the box office totals that are coming in hmmmmmmmm? Reply John Allen Small says June 25 2013 at 604 pm And yet in only its second week it was blown out of the water by - of all things - ""Monsters University."" Hmmmmmmmmmm? Reply hc says June 24 2013 at 426 pm Im thinking of a possible class-action lawsuit for hearing loss against the sound design team and Hans Zimmer. I spent much of the last 40 minutes of the film with fingers plugged in my ears (and eyes on my watch.) OUCH Thats Entertainment? Reply J.D. says July 4 2013 at 553 pm I was way too loud in my theater a complaint I thought Id never make. I love loud dialogue sound effects and music. But it was just deafening throughout. Reply Bob Peters says June 23 2013 at 830 pm Im a superman from the 50 and 60s. This move was a big budget story-less expedition into camp. i cracked up laughing to the point of tears. All this needed to be complete was BIF BAM and BOOM plastered over the screen. If superman screamed one more time ... This was not Superman. Reply Kory Stephens says June 18 2013 at 510 pm To the folk taking a pop at the reviewer and others GROW THE HELL UP AND STOP ACTING LIKE SELF ENTITLED PUNKS I swear this groupthink mentalitys laughable as it is disturbing and it gets worse ever year. Youre only confirming the fact that you lot are the lowest common denominator who truly enjoy making asses out of themselves online. Instead of a polite ""I respectfully disagree"" and move on you shout down anyone who doesnt have the same views as you like rabid dogs whore in need of euthanasia. So what if 100 odd film critics and some viewers voice their bemusement regarding Man Of Steel. Theyre no more entitled to their opinion than you are regardless of how much money it made opening weekend and being at the No. 1 spot. ITS NOT THAT FRIGGING SERIOUS You make those Kardashian stans (Super Fans FYI) look like saints...and to be blunt it really doesnt say much. Reply Ro22sS says June 17 2013 at 912 pm I agree with everything in this review. Too much large scale destruction that takes away from the realness of the characters. It was dark noisy and one dimensional. It had no charm. Nolan should have directed this but instead I feel like he was just involved to make money and nothing more. One thing this review left out is that once again just like Superman Returns there were too many Christian religious metaphors likening Kal-El to Jesus Christ as a Savior including his age of 33. Go back and watch Star Trek into darkness and Iron Man 3 and you will see movies that offer something for all audience members. Reply PRgirl94 says June 17 2013 at 1019 pm ""One thing this review left out is that once again just like Superman Returns there were too many Christian religious metaphors likening Kal-El to Jesus Christ as a Savior including his age of 33."" Well theres nothing wrong with that. Especially if youre Christian. Reply dt says June 17 2013 at 752 pm If you cant follow the action play more video games. It was pretty easy to tell what was going on... Reply Bill Eidson (EidsonB) says June 17 2013 at 1255 pm I really do not know what you movie you saw...it was not the same one I did that is for sure. When you are as Powerful as Superman you do not need to waste time rescuing kittens or changing tires. The was a big movie about big ideas that brings the story from one created by two Jewish kids with every thing from Jewish Lore to Victorian Strong Men....hence the underwear that is missing.. in 1938 to today world. One where not every one is open to oh BTW I am an Alien and Buck Rogers Science Fiction...to one grounded in some sort of real world setting.. Great Movie with Nod;s to Luther Wayne Enterprises and Booster Gold. There are so many place Goyer can take this....cant wait till the sequel and the JLA movie.... Reply Dennis says June 17 2013 at 1156 am The Kent farm is in Smallville Kansas... not Illinois. The different take on Krypton with the insect like technology and the strange animal Jor-El rides were distracting but the real downer for this flick was the characterization of Jonathan and Clark Kent. Jonathan places hiding Clarks secret above the lives of others? Clark learns this grows up an outcast lets Jonathan die in a tornado (NOT) and then KILLS Zod? ...very disappointing Clark has always been able to figure out a way to beat the bad guy without killing. Thats the biggest thing that makes him so special. Hes got ultimate power but he wont kill. Thats why hes called the boy scout. This version of the story would seem to lead to Ultraman not Superman... And how are they going to top the destruction of Metropolis? I mean I could see the fight with Doomsday taking down a lot of realestate but Zod? Also Zod was lame. Faora stole the show as a villian. Reply midshipmanx says June 17 2013 at 1222 pm But Superman did kill Zod in the comics (1988). Zod Faora and another. He wasnt even under the gun. He conducted a summary execution by purposely exposing them to kryptonite until they were dead because he didnt know of any way to stop them from continuing to destroy with their extreme powers. He then fell into a deep depression and self-exile from Earth until he felt like he needed to stop being selfish and wallowing and go back and help Earth again. So no he doesnt always figure out how to beat people without killing and certainly wouldnt let humans die while he figured out a kinder gentler solution. He also killed Doomsday. (though Doomsday always gets better it seems). Also I believe the farm scenes were all filmed in Illinois and Illinois was thanked several times in the credits which is probably where the confusion in the article came from. Reply Eidikos says June 17 2013 at 1149 am ""as the adopted son of Illinois farm folk Jonathan (a touching Kevin Costner) and Martha (Diane Lane) Kent"" Shouldnt that be ""Kansas farm folk...""? Reply midshipmanx says June 17 2013 at 1222 pm I believe the farm scenes were all filmed in Illinois and Illinois was thanked several times in the credits which is probably where the confusion in the article came from. Reply Steve rogers says June 17 2013 at 1030 am Lois lane figuring out who superman was and the way it happened was the weakest part of the movie. Up till that moment i was fine with all the ""reboot"" stuff going on. I found that scene to be forced dopey and remove a big element to the superman story which is lois not knowing who superman was and the tension between her and superman/ clark kent. The romance between snyders superman and lois also seems forced and there was absolutely no build up or chemistry. I was ok with the ""reboot"" because while this is different than the superman i remember from the comics (i stopped reading 15 years ago) all the basic elements are there... Just different. I also thought general zods motivation was rushed and the initial scenes were not scripted too clearly to understand whats going on or why. With a running time of 2 1/2 hours there was plenty of time to explain things. I felt as if they threw it at you quick so they could cut to a fight scene with lots of lens flaring. Reply PRgirl94 says June 17 2013 at 1232 pm If you stopped reading the comics 15 years ago then its no wonder why you didnt get this movie. This movie is truer to those comics than the other movies. And if youre upset about Lois knowing Clarks ID that was part of the status quo for almost 2 decades up until the New 52 and that worked out fine. Your complaint about that shows that youre really behind on your Superman. Reply The Captain says June 17 2013 at 747 am This article is SPOT on This is everything that is wrong with this film. I only hope Goyer and Snyder read this and take it too heart before they make the same mistakes with the sequel Reply Ro22sS says June 17 2013 at 917 pm totally agree Reply Dan says June 17 2013 at 734 am I saw this movie yesterday and I was surprised. Having hated Superman returns I found this one was more true to the comics. Clark really seemed torn up about the decisions he had to do and Zodd was fantastic. Its worth mentionning that the theatre was packed (at 3pm) and everyone applauded at the end. I dont care if critics dont like this movie I loved it everyone I know loved it and Im happy that this franchise is finally back on track. I cant wait for the sequel. Reply Sherrbano Taseer says June 17 2013 at 518 am Forget all of the Supermen of the past. Like it or not purists Man of Steel is the kind of theatrical reboot Superman has needed for a while. Reply Sana Askari says June 17 2013 at 517 am With Zack Watchman Snyder and Christopher Dark Knight Nolan behind the film its no surprise the mood should be dark and serious. If youre hankering after the playful innocence of Christopher Reeves Superman youll definitely be disappointed. Reply Dominic says June 17 2013 at 514 am The critic/reviewer clearly did not see the same movie most audiences saw. Should have gone to specsavers 3d imax is the only way to see this movie incredible experience 10/10. Reply Mikah F. says June 16 2013 at 1026 pm ILLINOIS?? Did this ""chief film critic"" even watch the film? Even if hes not a fanboy any idiot would know (just by childhood storytelling or watching the movie perhaps?) that Clark Kent was discovered and raised in KANSAS. Dumb review great movie. Reply Brad says June 16 2013 at 359 pm I stopped reading at ""Illinois farm folk"". (It was Kansas) Saw the movie. It was a great start to a reboot. Reply BJ says June 16 2013 at 1002 pm Im done with cowardly movie critics jumping on other cowards band wagons. Why this idiot is faulting the movie for some ""re-imagining"" I dont know. As a stand alone movie by itself the movie was good. These are the same idiots that said ""Superman Returns"" was good and that sucked. I guess this coward can still sit at the cafeteria table with the other cowards without being shunned. Reply Roy says June 16 2013 at 353 pm Finally saw M of S and i dont miss the cloying camp of the Donner superman. There is a visceral sense of risk that presents Clark/Kal El the true opportunity for heroism. Modern society has changed from the 40s-50s so to keep the strophe of Clark being advanced yet not self-diminishing to protect humans requires a change of story and other characters in his milieu. I had no problem with the last death in the movie in fact was a little annoyed with the amount of exposition to make it required.. I always went to Marvel for humor and DC was for those square jaws and solid morality plays. I like this Man of Steel. Reply Penny says June 16 2013 at 905 am He fought in the second film.. Reply John Allen Small says June 16 2013 at 828 am Having now seen the film I can attest that it was worse than I had feared. There were a few decent moments but this was by and large the most depressing Superman film Ive ever viewed. I have no doubt it will be a great financial success because all the young pups out there who are ranting and raving about they finally got a Superman for their generation will go back and see it countless times. But this character is NOT Superman; that fact was driven home for me once and for all at the moment this character finally ""defeats"" Zod. An utter travesty and a desecration of a great and noble character. If this is the Superman for a new generation I weep for that generation and what it means for the future of our society. Reply midshipmanx says June 17 2013 at 741 am You do know that in the comics Superman did end up having to kill Zod to defeat him Faora and Quex Ul. And this was back in 1988. It was one of his greatest regrets. In that event he wasnt even under the gun. He made a conscious decision to execute them for their crimes and potential to cause even more destruction. He exposed them to kryptonite until they were dead. So I dont know what Superman you think this movie desecrates. Certainly not the one thats existed for over 20 years. Essentially the movie actually makes the death more of a kill or be killed scenario instead of an summary execution as happened in the comics. Probably actually more redeemable of an act. Reply John Allen Small says June 17 2013 at 851 am Yeah I do remember that storyline. I also remember that Superman was haunted by the act and sent himself off into exile at the time. This was about the time I gave up on the comic books as well.

Reply John says June 16 2013 at 209 am ""fix what wasnt broken?"" Superman and Superman 2 were in their time great movies that made you believe a man could fly. In todays world of tweets and online media moviegoers are more cynical and as Superman Returns prooved do not want a nostalgic take on Superman. To say this film is without humour is also false. Whilst there are no scenes of Zod blowing a mans wig off or Lois hurting her hand punching a Kryptonian there were still some funny scenes such as Supes impaling a truckers rig. Man of Steel is Superman for this generation but as a 40 year old who enjoyed the originals its also a movie that appeals to the older generation. The story build up is told and acted well and Shannon is excellent as Zod. I actually liked how Lois found out Clarks secret early on and I look forward to seeing how their relationship continues in the sequel. The action was fast frenetic and awesome. You actually believed two super powered guys were going toe to toe. If you watch Superman 2 again you dont get that feeling. Im going to watch the movie for the second time today. Reply warren says June 15 2013 at 617 pm The first hour was enjoyable...the rest of it is as you say here...extremely loud violent with much blurring and little wit.

Wagner and Zimmer sound nothing like each other - harmonically orchestrationally the way they approach melody - basically in every way thats important. And if you listen to some Wagner youll discover that the vast majority of it is anything but bombastic. Zimmers own recent output is far more so... so why would the qualification be apt? Reply R. Paul Dhillon says June 15 2013 at 139 pm I have to say that its a better film than I was expecting as Im not a big fan of Superman. That said I agree that like many special effects laden big budget tent-poles its easily forgettable as there is not much original here in story or ideas to make it really memorable Snyder and Nolan has successfully updated Superman for the video-game generation whos idea of comic book films stems more from Spider-Man Batman and Marvel universe of recent big hits like The Avengers and Iron Man rather than the old Superman of Donner and even the recent Bryan Singer version. Also people shouldnt keep comparing the old ones to the new as it comes at a time when CGI is at much advanced stage and you can actually make a smash-em up Superman with all the high tech bells and whistles which would not have been possible in the past so the stories tended to show Superman as a nice all Americab good guy Since America itself is no more the good guy so Superman reflects that bad-ass and smash everything to smithereens attitude while still trying to retain some of the comic book characters core goodness The hyped-up action is just to cover-up a lame storyline most of which is taken by its origins telling but the action also is a marketing tool as well as a selling point to those movie goers are not fans of the superhero and just want to watch any guy In a cape kick some ass and save the girl This Superman will have longer legs at the box office than any incarnation before Reply Lewd Ood says June 15 2013 at 1256 pm So basically you didnt like ""Man of Steel"" because it wasnt close enough to the 35 year old Christopher Reeve version? ""One longs to see this Superman change a flat or rescue a kitten from a tree or take Lois for a flight around the block."" Well for 35 years some fans of Superman action movies and comic book movies longed to see Superman FINALLY fight something. Thankfully Goyer Snyder and Nolan actually came through where Donner et al let us down. Its just too bad that nostalgics like you cant let go of the past. Reply Phil8up says June 15 2013 at 842 am Lets get one thing straight with regards to a last comment regarding film reviewers and how more educated they are then the rest us. So therefore their judgement should be trusted. I bet anyone who reviews films for a living 9/10 doesnt read comics. So they have this preconceived notion of how the film should be just like the rest us. So like the rest of us they give it a bad review without objectively judging the film simply because the main character is SUPERMAN. If this was some made up character they didnt know from a film made 35yrs ago they would have loved it. This film accurately portrays the Superman in comics for the last 15yrs. That Donner Superman (who I grew up loving) hasnt existed in comics for a long time. Superman struggles with real issues in comics today and a lot of decisions arent cut and dry. Theres a lot of grey. One thing Ill say is this film didnt feel like a Superman film. And that aint bad. When I watched The Dark Knight after a while I forgot I was watching a Batman movie and felt I was watching a real good thriller. And THATS what a good movie should do. Now Im not saying this is on the level of TDK but it did the same thing for me and that speaks volumes. Reply Carlos says June 15 2013 at 646 am Critics are outdated and its the average audience that should be trusted. The movie was awesome and made Superman very beleivable in a real world setting. Everything i have read on critics saying he is gloomy and brooding is overreaction. Its just the right amount of drama and its fun I am a huge superman fan but that doesnt sway my opinion i would still be this honest. This is an our generation Superman and its great. Reply TK says June 15 2013 at 448 am The truth is this reviewer is mostly right. It lacks all the fun and charm of the originals. It isnt that fun of a movie. It is kind of like watching someone play the video game. It also feels like a Star Trek movie. There are also some good things about it. Mainly that Superman gets into fistfights. However this film doesnt really show us anything we havent seen in other movies. When the first Donner film came out it was ground-breaking. This one if forgettable. Reply Rocco says June 14 2013 at 303 pm This is Superman  Full Power. The flavor I like. Reply Hiram Malawi says June 14 2013 at 1253 pm I saw the movie a few hours ago. Semi-quoting Russell Crowe The movie was ""hokey as s"". Reply ShopBowen says June 14 2013 at 1229 pm Oh I almost forgot. MOS still has a 58% at RT which would rank it 4th out of six previous Superman films. Its a pity this has happened to my favorite comicbook character but Snyders reimagining was too disconnected from the characters roots. Reply ShopBowen says June 14 2013 at 1211 pm I find it amusing how fans react when critics reviews are not favourable. While the film is visually stunning its comparable to the Transformers franchise. Lots of destruction and action but the story and the characters as just an afterthought. Nolans influence is quite obvious. After the film was over my friends and other people agreed that it felt like we just watched Batman Begins with superpowers. Hopefully well get a better Superman on the next reboot a few years from now. Reply Dre says June 14 2013 at 1123 am I saw the movie and as a comic book fan I thought it did justice to what Superman is about. First of all Superman is one of the strongest beings in the DC Comic Universe; therefore his battles would result in a lot of collateral damage and possible fights in space. Not Superman changing flats or rescuing kittens. This fits with what one who reads the comics would find if they picked up a Superman comic book. I also find it difficult to understand why the critic is comparing this film with the previous two as if they are the gold standard for what Superman is as opposed to comic book. Maybe its just me but just about every movie based on comics deviate from the original in some sense. Also comics books and the characters change all the time. The original Batman was campy. He wasnt always the dark knight as hes known as today and the same thing is true for Zack Snyders version of Superman. Hes not a dark Superman. Hes not batman lite. Hes much more of a real person now than hes ever been. Hes a young guy with powers and responsibility that he didnt ask for; forced into a situation that no normal person would want and hes supposed to be happy? Hes just supposed to handle it with a smile right? Of course not. Im not calling the film a masterpiece but it was fun and exciting and I think if youre a fan of the comic you will like. Reply John Allen Small says June 14 2013 at 1030 am My favorite comment thus far regarding this film from a review on the website Thrillbent.com ""If your favorite part of SUPERMAN THE MOVIE was Superman standing in the Fortress while Jor-El lectured him youre gonna love MAN OF STEEL.""

Than he must fight his own kind instead of after years of being the only one...I wouldnt be smiling......FYI the comics of the past 5 years or so dont show a boy scout they show him dealing with real issues like what we see on the news with nations at war and people seeking safety from dictators..Superman is also with Wonder Woman not Lois Lane. Reply David says June 14 2013 at 214 am Honestly to put it bluntly the move isnt that good. Reply keith aanl says June 13 2013 at 939 pm hans zimmer score how can you tell one from the other they ALL sound the same just another overrated over paid ""composer"" Reply Chris says June 13 2013 at 729 pm Im so very relieved some of the top critics dislike this movie due to the fact any movie they tend to like (Superman Returns) is a waste of time and money. This is the Superman we have all waited for and the critics disdain for it solidifies my belief. Man Of Steel is exactly what Superman in film needed. A nod to the real character from the comics and animated show is what is craved by fans not some sappy story driven dribble critics eat up. Kudos to you for cementing my already starved desire to view this film. Reply LDH says July 7 2013 at 543 pm Yes because a film with a story is so very very bad. Reply JD13 says June 13 2013 at 1059 am You thought ""Iron Man 3"" was good so to say you lack credibility with a good super hero/comic book movie review is a gross understatement... Reply Rick Singer says June 13 2013 at 945 am By the way I saw a screening of the film last night.. and I agree with much of what this reviewer says. I likened the film and its endless f/x to a trip to Florence Italy some years back. After 2 days of non-stop sightseeing of countless Masters masterpieces friezes etc. I had an odd feeling of overload. You draw a ""ho-hum"" eventually to something extraordinary. They even have a word for it in Italian one guide mentioned I dont recall the word. It happens in this film. The last third of this film is an endless stream of loud effects. I expected SO much more. This was not a masterpiece like those in Italy... the end result did draw an ultimate ho-hum however. Reply John Allen Small says June 13 2013 at 638 am In going back and re-reading the majority of comments that have been posted here it strikes me that a lot of you dont even understand the nature of film reviews. They are by their very nature OPINION PIECES reflecting the feelings of the individual writer. The writer will base that opinion on any or all of a variety of criteria his own personal knowledge of the director the actor the screenwriter the genre of film or even film history in general; the quality of the acting directing or writing; comparisons between other films that are out at the same time; and even something as simple as how the film affects the reviewer as an individual sitting there in the theatre watching. All these criteria will have some kind of an impact on the reviewers final reaction to the film. But at the end of the day he or she has simply shared their opinion which the rest of us are free to agree or disagree with as we see fit. Now when it comes to our response to said opinion there is a valid and a non-valid way to express that response. The valid way is to say ""I agree"" or ""I disagree"" and to explain why. And by ""explaining why"" I dont mean ""Because I say so"" or ""Because hes an idiot."" Give us rational arguments; give us information that demonstrates that youre capable of making informed decisions rather than knee-jerk ""wah-wah-wah"" crybaby snottiness. The non-valid way is to say such things as ""This guy is an (insert favorite epithet)"" or ""I could write a better review."" The reason such responses are not valid is that (a) Having an opinion different that yours does not automatically make a person an idiot (or whatever other ugly name you chose to call him); and (b) No you probably couldnt write a better review than he could because he is a professional reviewer who likely as not has gone to school to study things like journalistic style and film criticism and even film history (can you say ""Roger Ebert boys and girls?) whereas based on the available evidence youre most likely just some know-it-all who thinks that having an opinion a keyboard and access to the Internet somehow makes you smarter than all the other know-it-alls with an opinion a keyboard and access to the Internet. Bottom line if you dont agree with this guys opinion thats fine and dandy. But try to express yourself intelligently and without resorting to name calling and hissy fits and the like. Because thats the kind of behavior that you should have outgrown somewhere around the second grade. And at the end of the day all it does is make YOU look like whatever vile and hateful name youve thrown at the reviewer whose opinion you disagree with. Anyway I have had say now and Im going to leave it at that. Ill go see ""Man of Steel"" this weekend simply because hey its a Superman movie and Ive seen them all. Based on what Ive seen and heard so far I expect to be disappointed. I genuinely HOPE Im wrong (and if I am you better believe Ill say so). But Im not holding my breath. Have a good day. Reply Rich says June 13 2013 at 157 pm John Allen Small I salute you That basically says it all. Reply Rick Singer says June 13 2013 at 932 am Great commentary John Allen Small. I appreciate your reasoning. I only wish it was more prevalent with others... Reply John Allen Small says June 13 2013 at 1022 am Thanks Rick. Nice to see there are a few people out there who get it. Jo-Ann says June 13 2013 at 552 am What does the fact that its 2013 have to do with anything? Zach Snyder has apparently sucked the soul out of Superman. This movie is 2 1/2 hours of ear splitting action. No on-screen chemistry between Lois Lane no humanity...no humor. I guess we should consider ourselves lucky that Russell Crowe isnt singing his part. Reply Richie Blanca says June 13 2013 at 129 am Reviewer here seems to have still in mind the previews Superman movies who were more joyous and adapted to their century. Come on this is 2013  audience has evolved and changed. You cannot expect to have a ""gone with the wind"" kind of movie instead and place of what M.O.S is supposed to be the ultimate super fighting machine One should watch M.O.S  as a stand alone movie and using only the comics as a sole point of reference. And that is what Zack Snyder a genuine movie maker visionnary has done. And the result is THE real superman we have always wished to see on a big screen Reply See All 188 Comments More Film News from Variety The Power of Content HBO President On Vinyls Demise On-Screen Violence -TCA Chelsea Vs.

Now Snyder (director) and Nolan (producer shared story credit) have teamed up on the iconographic DC Comics character who seemed impossible to bring into the ""grim and gritty""- Superman. Many characters (and comics readers) of the post-1986 landscape have disparaged the legendary superhero as a ""big blue boy scout"" for his primary-colored uniform and lack of moral ambiguity but ""Man of Steel"" sets out to darken up the last son of Krypton and to fit him to the current trend of brooding haunted vigilantes. See photos 35 Star-Studded Super Dramatic Man of Steel Images of Henry Cavill amp; Cast For the most part it works; in the previous big-screen treatments of the character weve never seen a pubescent Clark Kent deal with the disconcerting sensory overload of suddenly realizing he can hear things from miles away and see through everyones skin with his X-ray vision. When teen Clark saves his classmates from a terrifying bus accident (which calls to mind the horrifying opening sequence of Atom Egoyans ""The Sweet Hereafter"") its less cause for celebration than a moment of adolescent angst over the discovery of his difference. Nor have we ever seen a beginner Superman fall out of the sky while teaching himself to fly. Even that iconic costume emerges in darker hues - the blues are blackish and the reds are more wine-colored. (Hes still ignoring Edna Modes ""No capes"" rule which implies that ""The Incredibles"" doesnt exist in this films world.) Also Read Man of Steel Henry Cavill Was Nearly Badly Burned in Deleted Scene ""Man of Steel"" begins as Krypton is on the brink of destruction with the ruling council ignoring the pleas of scientist Jor-El (Russell Crowe) to figure out a way to save the planets bloodlines. Jor-Els onetime friend General Zod (Michael Shannon) picks that moment to stage a coup which is akin to seizing the bridge on the Titanic and even though everyone knows the planet is about to be destroyed Zod and his minions are still exiled into space as punishment for their treason. (Which makes no sense but its one of the few obvious fumbles in the screenplay by David S. Goyer.) Baby Kal-El rockets his way to Earth but the movie leaps forward to adult Clark Kent (Henry Cavill) working on a fishing trawler to get close enough to rescue derrick workers from an oil rig fire all the while attempting to do so in secret. He eventually hears about an Antarctic expedition that piques his interest and which provides him with the opportunity to come face to face with Lois Lane (Amy Adams) whos there to do a story on a strange object thats been found in the ice. See video Henry Cavills Superman Fights to Save All of Humanity in New Action-Packed Man of Steel Trailer That object is a Kryptonian ship that contains Jor-Els life memories in its computer and as Clark flies it away to commune with the father he never knew Lois traces the mystery mans identity all the way back to Smallville where Clark was raised by his adoptive parents Jonathan (Kevin Costner) and Martha (Diane Lane) whose values of basic decency and responsibility we see them impart to their alien son in flashback. By the time Clark puts on the suit Zod and his crew come out of stasis and take over Earths transmissions demanding that Kal-El be handed over to them and then its fight-fight-fight. Its worth noting that the melees are pretty spectacular particularly since both sides are still getting used to their powers on Earth but there are perhaps one or two too many of them. (The movie runs 140 minutes and feels like it could lose at least ten of them.) The performances here resonate though Cavill gets the characters square-jawed forthrightness down without sacrificing too much of Clark/Kals uncertainty and even bewilderment; his performance and Goyers script both go a long way in presenting this character as powerful but not invulnerable which automatically makes him more interesting. (Bullets still bounce off of him but the impact makes him flinch.) The appealing Adams again with the scripts support may be the first actress who plays Lois Lane not as a 1930s-style ""girl reporter"" but instead as an actual journalist who happens to be a woman. Shannon can of course do the villain thing in his sleep by now and while his Zod doesnt have the shadings of say the hired killer of ""The Iceman"" the actor still makes an impact. Theres no question that the movie reflects current trends in action and superhero movies from one characters sacrifice that feels like what a Spider-Man fan might call a ""reverse Uncle Ben"" to the shameless trafficking in 9/11 imagery Like ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" another reboot thats also a remake of a sequel we get planes flying into buildings. ""Man of Steel"" ups that ante with dust-covered civilians rescuing each other from urban rubble as well. One major plot twist which will not be revealed here promises to spark debate and controversy amongst longtime Superman buffs; if you thought ""organic web shooters"" was the stuff that message board flame-wars were made of you aint seen nothing yet. (And fans of product-placement drinking games should keep an eye peeled for the many many on-screen appearances of Sears IHOP and 7-Eleven.) All in all however this ""Man of Steel"" flies even if it doesnt quite soar. Snyders direction feels far more assured than it did in the misfires of ""Watchmen"" and especially ""Sucker Punch"" and now that the requisite first-movie origin story has been accomplished the movie lays the ground for what could be some thrilling sequels featuring a Superman whos both exactly what people want to see and a significantly different take on a well-established character.

Krypton the ill-fated planet that even people who actively avoid pop culture recognize as Supermans birth place comes alive in the prologue of Zack Snyders snazzy update with some of the finest special effects this side of ""Avatar."" A single virtual camera pan across Kryptons golden vistas reveals an intricately defined fantasy land filled with remarkable details braying alien livestock towering structures and airborne spacecraft instantly define a Krypton unlike anything achieved in 80 years of comics movies TV and videogames but the story cant keep up. Instead of making a blockbuster Superman movie Snyder has turned the Superman narrative into yet another modern day blockbuster. Impressive in parts scattered and blandly familiar in others ""Man of Steel"" attempts to rejuvenate its hero with a whole lot of big ideas stuffed into a dense assemblage that alternates between visual wizardry and complicated non-linear plot ingredients some better than others. However in contrast to the Richard Donner films that practically invented the guidebook to superhero movies ""Man of Steel"" is practically a reinvention of the Superman mythos. The earlier entries in the franchise enlivened the character with genre elements like comedy and romance that -- as with Joss Whedons delightful ""The Avengers"" last year -- balanced off the demand for extreme spectacle. Even Bryan Singers unfairly maligned 2006 take which bored audiences who obviously wanted a more explosive good time nobly placed the colorful nature of Supermans plight ahead of the action. ""Man of Steel"" takes a more self-serious approach constructing a sullen tale involving Supermans emerging commitment that (perhaps due to producer Christopher Nolans ""Batman"" influenced hand) almost never cracks a smile. Supermans inviting persona has even been drained from the title. Here the dreary atmosphere underscores unremitting commitment to a brooding storyline that creates the illusion of meaning behind the abundant CGI. Unlike its predecessors it would be impossible to imagine ""Man of Steel"" without the excessive production values which start to take hold after the unquestionably compelling first hour and eventually subsume other more promising ingredients hinted at during that time. At first ""Man of Steel"" attempts an outstanding fusion of pricey imagery and narrative finesse. By the end Henry Cavills subdued performance in the lead role is the sole element of restraint left onscreen. While certainly the most dazzling Superman movie to hit the big screen the 143-minute ""Man of Steel"" is also one of the longest and it only justifies that heft because it leaves room to keep the effects coming. David Goyers screenplay establishes a high stakes showdown between Superman and the menacing General Zod (Michael Shannon on autopilot his creepiness downgraded to a half-interested scowl) another surviving Kryptonian whose emergence from prison following the planets destruction leads him to try and destroy Earth in the hopes of making room for a new Krypton. In the early scenes Zod is revealed to have murdered Supermans dad Jor-El (Russell Crowe) in the days leading up to Kryptons demise. But its not clear if Superman ever learns this from the digital remnants of his father who trains him in his arctic headquarters some 33 years later. When Zod shows up hes just a bad guy that Superman must stop against impossible odds. READ MORE The Playlist Reviews ""Man of Steel"" Thats a reasonable conundrum for this type of overly familiar fare but the movie arrives there after establishing an especially intricate scenario in which the naturally intrepid reporter Lois Lane (a decently assertive Amy Adams) discovers Supermans secret and decides to sit on the story while he figures out his origin. Supermans own upbringing down south at the hands of amiable foster parents (a bland Kevin Costner and underutilized Diane Lane) unfolds in several flashbacks that elaborate on the challenges the young Clark Kent faces in keeping his powers to himself. The movie attempts the clever trick of telling both these stories at once with an overlapping structure that would make the creators of ""Lost"" swoon but its still an excessively dreary affair that lacks any sense of Supermans personality. Instead hes just another fancy effect from Snyders bag of tricks. Its easy to get swept up in the rollercoaster of buildup but the climax is just a yawn. But oh that bag of tricks. ""I cant print this"" Louis trenchant editor (Laurence Fishburne) says after receiving her first draft of her unpublished Superman scoop. ""You could have hallucinated half of it."" When ""Man of Steel"" comes to a close viewers can relate. And once they come back down to Earth perhaps warmer memories of the Supermen no longer considered viable will come rushing back. In ""Man of Steel"" Superman never suffers from exposure to fragments of Kryptonite. His single weakness -- and the movies after promising earlier bits drop off to make room for the extravagant conclusion -- is depth.

And not to sound mean or anything I dont need a movie review to tell me whether or not I should watch this film. once i feast my eyes on this film i will make my own assessment. Reply Joey1013 May 12 2016 152 pm I doubt half the reviewers actually saw the movie. People whoever never saw the movie join the bag-wagon. Obviously no one is comic fan on this site. Superman lost his red tights since 52 reboot for good reason. No reason for him to wear underpants on outside. Every comic had changed this stupid look on all their super heroes (sorry folks but underpants doesnt make them more heroic just stupid looking just saying). I will see for myself on the movie. As for reviewer I doubt he even read Superman comics to even comment on Superman. A lot of Reviewers are just fanboys of Marvel or just hate Superhero movies so they put false reviews. Movie is not officially out until today. I doubt reviewers were at all those special showing of Man of Steel.

Reply goldman May 12 2016 152 pm This film distorted and icon with no specific purpose. Great review. Reply KitCon May 12 2016 152 pm Agree with you 100%. Excellent review Reply Raymond May 12 2016 152 pm Its the costume that kills me. He just doesnt look like superman. I like the way the guy looks he has a cool look to him and it makes me want to give the movie a shot (Im not really gay but comfortable enough with my sexuality to say that) but then I see him in costume and Im like nope never mind. This whole nitty gritty comic book superhero thing worked with batman because the darkness was there already submerged by years of bad TV and Comic Book adaptations sure but there and waiting to be exploited. Superman though is a shiny super hero ideal super human that is the whole point of his character. I havent seen the movie so I cant comment on how faithful it was to him on that level but looking at him it makes me think hollywood has just done it again. That aside dont worry if people say your movie sucks fans all Hollywood movies suck (gasp its true just accept it). Hollywood movies generally suck hard the batman films with the exception of the Dark Knight all sucked the spider man films sucked Iron Man and the Avengers didnt try to aspire to anything so its kind of unfair to say they sucked plus Joss Whedon. But yeah they werent exactly great movies. Thats fine. Great Movies are generally boring (with few exceptions) so just enjoy your sucky movie and go on with your life. Reply gyna May 12 2016 152 pm Great Review Eric. Reply Irene May 12 2016 152 pm I am an NYU graduate of American history. Superman encodes our collective target of goodness and ethics. Your review shows that the current man of steel has abandon this coding to produce a mediocre soap opera. Thanks for finding the courage to state this. C+ is generous though.

Reply arthur May 12 2016 152 pm Finally a reviewer have the guts to state the obvious fact This is mediocre movie exploiting an icon on Americana to create a new version of a ""human"" super hero. for US children of other epochs who grew up with Superman as the embodiment of selflessness and honesty this film doe not resonate.

Reply Matthew K. May 12 2016 152 pm Interesting review but it is so long-winded and convoluted that it defeats its purpose. Just because youve got the space to write anything you want doesnt mean you shouldnt self-edit and do some smart re-writing and tightening. A good dismissal of this movie can be written well and written smart and written solid. This thing meanders and explains too much and becomes utterly boring almost exhausting. Reply Julie May 12 2016 152 pm Thank you. Thank you. Thank you Eric Kohn for articulating why I felt sad after I walked out of an early screening of Man of Steel. Although I thought it was a decent enough film. It just didnt feel like a Superman movie. I love the original 1978 Superman with Christopher Reeves and Margot Kidder. As a huge Superman fan in general I was disappointed. You articulated it best as to whats wrong with the film and why. Its a blockbuster movie. Its not Superman movie. Sigh. Reply Michael Stever May 12 2016 152 pm My first instinct would be to steer clear of any film (or their PR department) that would dismiss all the previous films of its namesake that came before it. Its a COLOSSAL slap in the face on virtually every conceivable level. This films press-machine really needs to re-think its strategy where thats concerned. Secondly I find the general hostility here in the comments section extremely unfortunate and DOUBLE sad where our collective consciousness is concerned compared to when Richard Donners epic truly groundbreaking 1979 Superman The Movie inspired people to believe that a man could really fly.

This is why brown people do not belong giving opinions on American clasics they do not understand what it is to be a hero for this country nor do the brown people understand American cultire and what this country was founded on. Snyder does MOS was the most mind blown movie Ive seen in many years What a horrible review done by a brown nigger Reply safichan May 12 2016 152 pm this guy...whatever his name is...i am very sure he rushed to make this review...clearly there are many mistakes in his article...just for what?? Just to say man of steel is bad...funny...really funny...how can he become a top reviewer in rotten tomatoes?? He even gave lords of salem B+...gold comedy... Reply logicalwriter May 12 2016 152 pm The problem I had with the film was the lazy writing. Ill vaguely touch upon these areas in order not to spoil it too much. LOOK AWAY The entire 3rd act is action. Zod is vanquished in a way that is completely at odds with the character that is Superman. It is completely asinine. Finally Johnathan Kent. What happens to him makes absolutely no sense in a universe in which Superman can easily run near the speed of light. Reply Thomas P May 12 2016 152 pm Oh god all of these comic-book (thus nihilistic) fanboys commenting on this review getting angry at the fact that it wasnt positive really need to get a life. Its a negative review. Big deal. You guys havent even seen the film yet. (Oh wait you already know youre gonna love it; youre just that smart.) Reply Maya May 12 2016 152 pm This has to be the worst movie review that I have ever wasted my time to read. This ""review"" just didnt make any sense. The author needs to be informed that he shouldnt review movies if he fills his report with the type of logic that would earn a failing grade on a middle school book report. Reply Frankie May 12 2016 152 pm Um youre faulting the film for not feeling enough like a Superman movie and you cant even spell Lois instead of Louis (yeah I know Lois is kind-of an old fashioned name but at-least its a... yknow... girls name) and the name of her editor (Perry White) so on top of the fact that you called Deadbeat Dad Returns ""unfairly maligned"" Im afraid I just cant take this review seriously. Superman the Movie was great and Ill even call the third one a guilty pleasure. But theres nothing wrong with a serious Superman film. Reply Jason May 12 2016 152 pm I havent even seen the movie yet but you Eric Kohn are an idiot. You are now 1 of 13 reviewers to give this movie a rotten rating. Really? You cant get on board with the modernizing or relating or most important aspect of Christlike symbolism Superman stands for? Its sad that anyone even reads your reviews. It wont stop the box office success of this as you call it ""blockbuster."" ) Reply Jason May 12 2016 152 pm I havent even seen the movie yet but you Eric Kohn are an idiot.

That said I dont see how there was any way this movie could have satisfied your odd and arbitrary standards. Your critique appears to be purposefully contrary to the many other glowing reviews. Also revising the typos and correcting misspelled names without notation is a little disappointing. It also exposes your lack of attention to detail but we noticed. For that alone I wont be back. Reply OhFFS May 12 2016 152 pm Yep here come the fanboys. The floodgates are open. THIS kind of reaction was why the comment sections were disabled on rottentomatoes. ""Is that dissent? QUICKLY WE MUST USE THE POWER OF OUR ENTHUSIASM OVER A MOVIE WEVE NOT SEEN YET TO SQUASH IT"" And then they bludgeon the critic to death with their raging nerd boners. Do yourself a favor and do the same. Disable all comment sections for reviews. Reply Deedee May 12 2016 152 pm who the hell is LOUIS. HAHAHA. You were clearly not even paying attention to the movie when you cant even get the name of the freaking protagonist right and yet you give it a C. GTFO you douchebag hypster Reply safichan May 12 2016 152 pm dont worry folks...this eric guy gave LORDS OF SALEM B+ review in rotten tomatoes...hahahahah...what do u expect from him... Reply Tommy Rob May 12 2016 152 pm Think its time to expose this guy to Rotten Tomatoes please revoke this guys ""Top Reviewer"" title NOT because he didnt like MOS but EVERYTHING else lol Reply Joey May 12 2016 152 pm I write for several websites and I must tell you that the above is in no way a review but a hack job. The horrendous display of grammar shows that you rushed this article to grab ""hits"" as the people have stated here. You should be ashamed to call yourself a ""Top Reviewer"" The simple fact that you took a C+ and made it spoiled on RT just proves that what you lack in talent you will make up with deception. Here is a little help since your Editor obviously doesnt keep you on your leash Kryptonians are the inhabitants of Krypton. Kryptonite is from the radioactive meteorites that was once the planet Krypton after it exploded. In case you missed it Kryptonite was no where in this movie This was not an ""Indie"" film and it should not have been reviewed that way. You are an embarrassment to the profession Reply Wake The Editor May 12 2016 152 pm ""While certainly the most dazzling Superman movie to hit the big screen the 143-minute ""Man of Steel"" is also the longest..."" 143 minutes is more than 154 minutes (Superman Returns)? Should I expect this from an article that calls Lois Louis? Just admit it you dont know what youre talking about and probably didnt want to like the movie before you sat in the seat. Reply Mine is bigger May 12 2016 152 pm Hahaha Marvel fanboys are getting worried. Marvel movies are to happy go lucky and very campy. DC movies suck look at Superman Returns Green Lantern ect. Comic book movies suck. They all the same pieces of shit. Reply BKB The REAL BKB May 12 2016 152 pm Just another depressing DC movie.. DC will always be 2nd to Marvel.. Reply Eddie May 12 2016 152 pm I stopped caring about your opinion after you admitted to liking ""Superman Returns."" I just got back from an early screening of ""Man of Steel"" and it is nothing short of spectacular. When I say spectacular I mean it is on par with The Dark Knight Trilogy aka the greatest superhero films ever made. Like people that gave ""The Dark Knight"" a bad review you are simply trying to garner attention for your article. Its extremely pathetic. Reply Mr. Louis Lane May 12 2016 152 pm ""...Louis trenchant editor (Laurence Fishburne)..."" I cant believe its still there. You got most of the other mistakes now fix this one. That or there better be a guy named Louis in this film that Superman is in love with. Reply SteveB May 12 2016 152 pm LOL The REST of the articles on this site have an average of 0-2 comments LOL No wonder they had one of their pawns write a bad review whatever they gotta do to bring traffic sad.... Reply Josh B May 12 2016 152 pm Omg there is alot of spoilers in this review ....WTF FUCK YOU  Reply IS May 12 2016 152 pm Look INDIEWIRE I dont have a problem with a critic not being a fan of the MOS movie but AT THE VERY LEAST please make sure the copy and review make sense at least before publishing it live on the WWW. It clearly discredits your site as a whole when a representative of your site fails this poorly and then attempts to fix the edits after the comments come pouring in flagging his mistakes. Reply peronix May 12 2016 152 pm Fuck this guy -/ writing a negetive review to get hits. weirdo Reply Jay May 12 2016 152 pm Way to be ""that guy."" Couldnt be more wrong I saw a sneak preview and it tore the roof off. The movie delivers like no real superhero movie has (Nolan films aside due to non-superhumans.) This review is a joke one to bring down numbers and get readers off cheap credit less stabs at a summer movie. Way to be ""indie"" I take it Spider-Man 3 was good to you too. Reply Mark May 12 2016 152 pm Wow what a pathetic review fuk this website just writing this for more hits . Reply Van Cockcroft May 12 2016 152 pm Sounds AWFUL. Reply Fay-El May 12 2016 152 pm Im sorry but I have to ask Are the editors asleep or is the writer the son/nephew of someone important? Reading through this was just awful. Like someone rushed it out just to disparage the film. This review was full of spoilers errors misspellings and misinformation. - Lois (Kal-El falls for someone named Louis? Superman really IS reinvented) is spelled wrong. - Kryptonians not Kryptonites. - Prologue comes before Epilogue - Did you really have to say what Zod did to Jor-El in the review? Not cool. - Superman Returns was longer than this film. Runtime 154 min I know you fixed all of that stuff after going through the comments but this reviews was very juvenile. Indiewire you should be ashamed of this mess you put up. Reply eli May 12 2016 152 pm douchebag hipster - stick to films made for 10. Reply Alex May 12 2016 152 pm I dont care about the review just hope the person who wrote this article knows deep down inside that he is an idiot Reply Shane S May 12 2016 152 pm ""A Very Non-Indie Superman"" LOL WHAT DID YOU EXPECT??? Its SUPPOSED TO BE WBS BIGGEST SUMMER BLOCKBUSTER So you gave it a bad rating because it was being good at what it was supposed to be? Makes a whole loft of sense. Reply eli May 12 2016 152 pm Of course this idiot critic is trying to make a name for himself being so maverick - thumbs down your crappy crits. Reply DEasley May 12 2016 152 pm hold up hold up.............you gave ""Universal Soldier Day of Reckoning"" an A-?? Wait..why is THIS guy considered a legitimate reviewer?? Reply Awesome May 12 2016 152 pm Who hired this guy to write an article he needs to go back to school. Such a loser. Bad article filled with lies. Reply BKB May 12 2016 152 pm Very Good.. This move should get a F but the fear made you give it C+.. Man of Steel wont touch Iron Man 3 and Thor 2 will be even better.. Reply Dane Cook May 12 2016 152 pm of course all his top rated movies on RT are indie flicks that no ones ever heard of because thats what REAL movie enthusiasts watch. Whatever keeps you more hipster Eric. But thats right Superman is not classy enough to fit in with the indie crowd of movies...lol Reply Zod May 12 2016 152 pm From the side ""While certainly the most dazzling Superman movie to hit the big screen the 143-minute ""Man of Steel"" is also the longest and it only justifies that heft because it leaves room to keep the effects coming."" lol Superman Returns is 154 minutes and Superman the Movie was also 143 minutes. Do some damn research next time before making false claims. Reply Greg May 12 2016 152 pm Ill never take a word you write seriouly ever again. Reply Lex Luthor May 12 2016 152 pm This guy is an asshole. This movie is epic just another critic trying to make a name for himself. JACKASS LOSER Reply Le pupe May 12 2016 152 pm My gawd Epilogue =/= PROLOGUE... Its LOIS not LOUIS..and so on amp; so forth... Opinions are like ah0les indeed... Reply Fuck you May 12 2016 152 pm I know why u gave this a bad review. U work for a web site called ""indie""wire. hipster scum Reply Le pupe May 12 2016 152 pm My gawd Epilogue =/= PROLOGUE... Its LOIS not LOUIS..and so on amp; so forth... Opinions are like ah0les indeed... Reply Mike May 12 2016 152 pm A C+ is a fresh review but this scumbag submitted it as rotten to get more page hits. Reply Sam May 12 2016 152 pm Idiot you just spoiled the movie for me watch what you wright Reply Jor-El May 12 2016 152 pm If its a C+ here why is it a 58 on Metacrtitic? Learn2grade Reply Kneel Before Zod May 12 2016 152 pm So the problem with this film is that its not a blockbuster but a modern-day blockbuster... lol what? Reply Lisse May 12 2016 152 pm Im unsure how I will feel about this movie and I am certainly worried about it taking itself too seriously without even having watched it yet. However you thought the Avengers was delightful and I hated it so very much mostly due to characterization of my favorite comic book characters so our tastes are probably different anyway. Reply Falaf-El May 12 2016 152 pm ""...another surviving Kryptonite..."" Are they called that in this film or Kryptonians? Ive never heard Kal-Els race being referred to as Kryptonites but then again I havent seen this movie yet so I dont know. Reply Gabriel Blanchard Jetzer May 12 2016 152 pm STOPPED (BLOODY DYSLEXIA) Reply ANON May 12 2016 152 pm lol at all the people correcting you in the comments. How does rotten tomatoes allow garbage like this to be submitted? Reply iJack May 12 2016 152 pm Im excited as fuck for MoS and this review or any other will change that wiith that said... keep it civil mates. Reply Marcus May 12 2016 152 pm Your review misses the mark and is absolutely horriblea| why they allow people like you to review films is beyond me. Reply Sean May 12 2016 152 pm What John said. The truth is better than a few extra hits. Reply Dave May 12 2016 152 pm ""naturally intrepid reporter Louis Lane"" ""Louis trenchant editor."" Louis. Louis Louis Louis. C+ Seems legit. Thats a rating for your spelling right? Or is it a rating for your understanding of Superman lore? At any rate wheres the rating for Man of Steel? Reply john May 12 2016 152 pm lol - posting a negative review to get hits for your site. pathetic - like your review. Reply Fire this guy May 12 2016 152 pm a C+ is still considered fresh dumbass.
