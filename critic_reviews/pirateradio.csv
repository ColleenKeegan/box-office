Rhys Ifans stars in Richard Curtis film PIRATE RADIO a Focus Features release. A sentimental journey that sails into Davy Joness locker Add to ... Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Nov. 12 2009 140PM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 318PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Pirate Radio Written and directed by Richard Curtis Starring Philip Seymour Hoffman Kenneth Branagh and Tom Sturridge Classification 14A He may have done more to influence British romantic comedies than anyone in the past 20 years but Richard Curtis the writer of Four Weddings and a Funeral  Notting Hill and Love Actually  goes off-shore and out of his depth with Pirate Radio . This fictionalized account one of the radio ships which beamed rock music into British homes in the mid-sixties has a wealth of historical material to draw on and a strong ensemble cast including Philip Seymour Hoffman Bill Nighy Emma Thompson and Kenneth Branagh. But Curtiss script is essentially an American frat-boy comedy with a series of vignettes showing games and ribaldry virginity to be lost and pompous squares to offend. Re-edited and retitled (formerly The Boat that Rocked ) from its English release the story following the model of Almost Famous  centres around the arrival of a teenager Carl (Tom Sturrridge pale and delicate in the Robert Pattinson mode) who has been sent to spend time on the Radio Rock boat managed by his godfather Quentin (Nighy). Carl is soon introduced to the gang of DJs and staff including the gruff iconoclast American import the Count (Hoffman) roly-poly ladies man Dave (Nick Frost) and Carls easily confused roommate Thick Kevin (Tom Brooke). They play charades get drunk and outrage the government by broadcasting lively songs and dirty words into Englands homes. Curtiss forte is the comedy-drama hybrid but there are only a few pokes at real emotions here each dutifully accompanied by an illustrative song. One naively romantic DJ (Chris ODowd) makes the mistake of bringing a wife Elenore on board ( Mad Men s January Jones) hes in for some short-lived heartbreak. Cue the Turtles tune Elenore . Carl meets and falls for Quentins pretty niece Marianne (Talulah Riley) and when she goes back to shore we hear Leonard Cohens So Long Marianne . Carl comes to believe that his party-girl mother (a miscast Thompson) must have put him on the ship to meet the father hes never known so we hear Cat Stevenss Father and Son . The weakest scenes are those that are land-bound featuring Branagh as a prissy government minister named Dormondy. Branagh plays the part with a bundle of John Cleese-like spasms and snide insults but the jokes are at a sub- Carry On Gang level. Case in point He has an assistant named Twatt (Jack Davenport) which allows Branagh to wheeze ""I like you Twatt."" Pirate Radio is also about a rich era in pop music and there are countless montages of enthusiastic English people gathered around portable radios boogying to new sixties songs from the Kinks the Who the Rolling Stones the Turtles Jimi Hendrix and the Beach Boys. (No Fab Four here though; British films dont have that big a budget.) Much of this music is still too pervasive to qualify as nostalgia and in some respects the story is really about the first steps toward rock radios commercial homogenization. Forty years ago they couldnt get these songs on the radio; now we cant get them off.

This oafish epic about the End of Days--as predicted by the Mayan calendar--operates in a dead zone roughly equidistant between parody and idiocy. You do get the connection between tongue and cheek but much of the humor still goes thud. A few action sequences rise to the challenge of the subject but many of the digital effects look murky and the cumulative effect is numbness. The only character with genuine if grotesque energy is Charlie Frost a crackpot prophet conspiracy theorist and pirate radio broadcaster played by Woody Harrelson; he provides a few jolts of Rapture schlock before the movie turns into destructo drek. For better or (mainly) worse Mr. Emmerich is up to his old tricks. In ""Independence Day"" he tested our mettle with marauding aliens. In ""The Day After Tomorrow"" he unleashed global warming that precipitated global freezing. This time his cosmic weapon of choice is a beam of mutant neutrinos that emanates from the sun and by heating the earths core destabilizes tectonic plates defeats coherence (though the huge disjointed production might have been conceived as a study in chaos theory) and degrades dialogue. (""An unprecedented international venture is under way"" the American president tells his daughter during an intimate conversation couched in the near-English favored by Emmerich films.) ENLARGE A scene from 2012 Columbia Pictures The international venture involves building what Charlie suspects to be a fleet of space ships that will save the rich and powerful before our planet goes the way of Krypton; to get a seat the wild-eyed geezer says ""youd have to be Bill Gates or Rupert Murdoch or some Russian billionaire."" (Of the three only a particularly obnoxious Russian billionaire has a confirmed reservation.) Since the White House has kept a lid of secrecy on the existence of the ships--which arent really what Charlie suspects--it falls to the presidents chief science advisor Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) to uncover the truth. Once he does however Adrian like his boss seems blithely indifferent to the ventures ethical aspects which arent debated until the movies climax. (The president finally wonders aloud if seats on the ships should have been offered in a lottery. That sounds like a plan except for leaving six or seven billion passengers wait-listed.) ENLARGE John Cusack catches a plane in 2012. Columbia Pictures The script is so scatterbrained that no one ever seems to understand anything in real time; its as if all reactions are on 30-minute delay. (The running time is 158 minutes.) Whats more ""2012"" has no discernible attitude toward the end of civilization apart from the belief that theres a movie in it. The cast includes John Cusack as Jackson Curtis a sci-fi novelist turned limo driver; Amanda Peet as Jacksons ex-wife Kate; Danny Glover as the president; Thandie Newton as his daughter; and Oliver Platt as the presidents steely chief of staff. Among the points of interest either damaged disturbed or destroyed are Las Vegas the Vatican the Himalayas the South Pole (relocated to Wisconsin) the Washington Monument much of Wyoming and all of California. For once Manhattan meets its fate offstage. Pirate Radio ""Pirate Radio"" follows the form--when it chooses to follow any form--of a cat-and-mouse game between the British government circa 1966 and a crew of raffish DJs beaming round-the-clock rock n roll from a decrepit tanker anchored in the North Sea just outside Albions territorial waters. Whitehall in the person of a puritanical government minister played by Kenneth Branagh views the ship and its transmissions as ""a sewer."" The ships captain and station owner a spacey dandy played by Bill Nighy sees his vessel as an island of anarchy in a sea of conformity. (At the time BBC radio barely acknowledged rocks existence.) Richard Curtiss comedy is anchored only in exuberance but thats more than you can say for most movies these days; it keeps you beaming with pleasure. ENLARGE Tom Sturridge looks on as Rhys Ifans handles the mic in Pirate Radio. Focus Features Mr. Curtis first made his mark in feature films as the writer of ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and ""Notting Hill."" Until now his only experience as a big-screen filmmaker was as the writer-director of ""Love Actually"" a mixed bag of romantic notions in which Hugh Grant played a British prime minister and Mr. Nighy was an aging drug-addled rock star. ""Pirate Radio"" (which was originally called ""The Boat That Rocked"") is another mixed bag if truth be told. The writing can get fairly ragged in between the many felicities. The direction recalls but seldom approaches the elegant anarchy of Richard Lesters Beatles films. Some comic bits work beautifully--Im partial to a silent buddy-bonding scene involving cookies and a glass of coffee--while others work haltingly or not at all. Yet the movies flaws matter little when theyre measured against its marvelous music terrific performances and vivid sense of place at a special time--not just a rust bucket in the North Sea but Great Britain two decades after the devastation of World War II in the throes of a pop-cultural revolution. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays a DJ called The Count; his work is as always an amalgam of the mysteriously laconic and the enjoyably histrionic. Other members of the fine cast are Rhys Ifans Nick Frost Tom Sturridge Rhys Darby Talulah Riley and January Jones as well as Emma Thompson in a cheery cameo. And a looseness of form doesnt exclude a profusion of events or a panoply of borrowings from ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" through ""Mamma Mia"" and ""Titanic"" to the civilian flotilla of rescue vessels at Dunkirk. ""Pirate Radio"" takes freely and gives generously. Fantastic Mr. Fox Life is full of surprises. The best one Ive had in a good while is ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" Wes Andersons stop-action animated version of the classic childrens novel by Roald Dahl. Who could have guessed--certainly not me--that animation and Mr. Anderson most recently the director of ""The Darjeeling Limited"" would be an inspired and mutually inspiring match? Instead of the vapid motion-capture process of ""A Christmas Carol"" he and his collaborators give us a captivating entertainment for the holiday season and well beyond. ENLARGE Mr. Fox voiced by George Clooney aims to live up to his adjective in Fantastic Mr. Fox. Fox Searchlight Pictures The script which the director wrote with Noah Baumbach takes elaborate liberties with its source material. Now the bane of three farmers existence is a bushy-tailed newspaper columnist voiced by George Clooney. (His wife voiced by Meryl Streep had been urging him to stop stealing birds and find a new line of work.) If that sounds precious or improbable--a wild animal hasnt written a newspaper column since the days of Jimmy Breslin--the film is all of that and more the more being foxily funny. The visual style is a radical departure from the original Quentin Blake illustrations but a hugely endearing one thats rendered in exotic colors stuffed with more details than a Richard Scarry page and popping with zestful inventions. So whos the films audience? The voice cast alone should be a draw for adults--not just Mr. Clooney who gives a commanding (no kidding) comic performance but Ms. Streep Bill Murray Michael Gambon Willem Dafoe Jason Schwartzman Owen Wilson; theyre all delightful in their respective ways. And the look of the film should enchant kids who may be too young to savor the sophisticated script. All I can say for certain is that I didnt expect to be the audience for this lovely oddity but I was. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com DVD FOCUS ENLARGE Still Crazy ( 1998) Bill Nighy has made a specialty of playing drugged-out rockers; its a dubious niche that he occupies with rare distinction. In this comedy directed by Brian Gibson he is Ray the former lead singer of Strange Fruit a 1970s band trying to pull itself together for a 20th-anniversary concert. Poor ravaged Ray coming up on his 50th birthday has an icy epiphany on a frozen canal in Holland and the pain of the moment may leave you gasping rather than laughing. The movie a bittersweet song of yearning and unlikely reconciliation was written by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais. ENLARGE Grosse Pointe Blank (1997) John Cusacks disconsolate hit man Martin Q. Blank decides to kill two birds with one stone. On the same weekend hes supposed to assassinate someone in his home town of Grosse Pointe an affluent suburb of Detroit he searches for meaning in his life by attending his 10th high-school reunion. Its a premise that could quickly turn ugly (or simply go flat as it does toward the end). Mainly though the director George Armitage working from a dense script by Tom Jankiewicz D.V. DeVincentis Steve Pink and Mr. Cusack sustains an impressive level of crazed logic and whirligig energy. ENLARGE The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou (2004) This quixotic comedy like ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" was directed by Wes Anderson and written by him and Noah Baumbach. And this movie like their new one uses stop-action though only briefly to populate a magical ocean with fanciful fish. Bill Murray plays the Cousteau-like hero an oceanographer-documentarian whos at once funny screwy childish gallant and rueful or downright depressed. When I reviewed ""The Life Aquatic"" I worried that Mr. Anderson by insisting overmuch on cleverness ""could be walking a plank of his own construction."" If any of that was true he has tossed the plank and in ""Mr. Fox"" gained a solid new footing. -- Joe Morgenstern Find television listings at LocateTV.

"Movie review Pirate Radio with Philip Seymour Hoffman and Kenneth Branagh washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Pirate Radio Movie review Pirate Radio with Philip Seymour Hoffman and Kenneth Branagh The film stars from left Tom Sturridge Rhys Darby Will Adamsdale and Bill Nighy. (Alex Bailey) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday November 13 2009 In town to introduce a preview screening of ""Pirate Radio"" writer-director Richard Curtis (""Love Actually"") described his comedy about a boatload of renegade DJs who broadcast rock-and-roll from a ship anchored off the coast of England in the mid-1960s as only ""partly true."" Well duh. The disclaimer will I suspect be utterly unnecessary for anyone who sees the film a tale so raucous raunchy and punch-drunk with love for the rebellious spirit of rawk -- and so disdainful of those who have tried to squelch it -- that it pretty much negates any claims to objectivity let alone factuality. In other words its not a documentary. The premise however is very real. In mid-1960s England just as the Kinks and the Beatles were taking the world by storm official British radio was under the monopoly of the BBC which played precious little of anything anyone actually wanted to hear. In response enterprising broadcasters set up offshore radio stations that would spin the latest tunes around the clock. They werent technically illegal -- yet -- but there were those who wanted to shut them down. In ""Pirate Radio"" those would be Sir Alistair Dormandy a priggish cabinet minister played with apoplectic if tight-lipped relish by Kenneth Branagh and his coolly competent aide Twatt (Jack Davenport). Their names alone should be enough to tip you off that these are the bad guys. Dormandy is an upper-class twit and Twatt is well exactly what you think. The movie crackles with a cartoonish malevolence whenever theyre on screen. On the other side is a raffish rogues gallery of lovable losers led by ships captain Quentin (Bill Nighy). Dubbed Radio Rock the floating stations on-air talent pool includes headliner Gavin (Rhys Ifans) a prototypic Howard Stern and a lineup of such colorfully nicknamed characters as Thick Kevin (Tom Brooke) Big Dave (Nick Frost) and The Count (Philip Seymour Hoffman) the stations lone American who lives to see how many f-bombs he can get on air. Why do you think Dormandy wants to shut them down? Or better yet let them sink? But the film really centers on Quentins teenage godson Carl (Tom Sturridge) a fresh-faced kid who has been kicked out of school for smoking (yes both kinds) and sent to work at the station by his party-hearty single mother (Emma Thompson) as a way to straighten him out. What is she crazy? Probably not. A prominent subplot involves speculation about which one of the stations staff might be Carls father and how long it will take Carl to figure it out. Despite a pretty obvious red herring it isnt hard to guess. Another narrative thread involves Carls halfhearted attempts to lose his virginity to a couple of female visitors to the ship. And by halfhearted I mean half sweet . . . and half nasty. One episode shows Carl tossing Big Daves last condom into the North Sea as a way to prove the purity of his love for Quentins niece Marianne (Talulah Riley). The irony is that only moments later hes going to wish he hadnt. Yeah I know. But such is what passes for romance around here. Radio Rock is pretty much as Sir Alistair describes it ""a sewer of dirty irresponsible commercialism and low morals."" Whats not to like? Its ""Animal House"" on water with Branagh playing Dean Wormer. If theres a love story then it isnt Carls but director Curtiss. And the object of his -- and the movies -- swooning affection is none other than the nose-thumbing sex-obsessed antiestablishment roots of rock music. Despite its plentiful crude humor ""Pirate Radio"" does have a soft spot. Remember that girl Lou Reed sang about in the Velvet Undergrounds classic ""Rock and Roll""? The one whose ""life was saved"" by a rock-and-roll radio station? Just when things look most dire for the embattled crew of Radio Rock ""Pirate Radio"" attempts to return the favor. R.

""Pirate Radio"" shines a light on a neglected little truth about rock music Its true nature is less ""Wont Get Fooled Again"" or ""Satisfaction"" than ""Yellow Submarine."" All the bubble and bounce (and seaworthiness) of the latter song defines Richard Curtis affectionate 1960s comedy about a boat that rocked just off British territorial waters. It broadcast pop tunes to a grateful audience when the airwave-controlling BBC largely refused to play such tommyrot. The boat is a libertarian wonderland in which an American deejay (Philip Seymour Hoffman) a wacky owner (Bill Nighy) and a dandified lothario (Rhys Ifans) frolic in peace free of all government intrusion -- until a buzz-cut Cabinet minister (a briskly hateful Kenneth Branagh who trained for this part by playing a Nazi in HBOs ""Conspiracy"") tries to invent a reason to shut it down. Curtis the writer of ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" has dropped another bright joy-bomb that explodes in every direction with rock classics used in surprisingly direct and literal ways. (A highlight is the track that plays under one of the most spectacular screen entrances of the year centered on the toothsome January Jones). Rock n roll to Curtis (who was a kid at the time) is all little kids jumping on beds tired nurses on break custodians at work and lots of people (this is his strangest tic) who listen on the toilet. He is taking the mickey out of rocks view of itself as an esoteric taste for self-described rebels Listening to rock is for everyone even oldsters in sweater vests. At the same time though broadcasting rock becomes a genuine act of rebellion not just a pose of sullen alienation. The pirate radio broadcasts become actually illegal the shipmates facing risk of prosecution and even death. Curtis is less deft in juggling the many characters and story lines than he was in the more polished ""Love Actually."" This movie was cut by 20 minutes after it sank in Britain and it still feels 20 minutes too long even as several episodes run shorter than ""Love Me Do."" One guy pops up from the crowd to announce a quickie marriage in a subplot that begins and ends in a rush. Curtis gets overly ambitious when he hauls in references to the greatest maritime defeat Britain ever won and the most famous ship ever built in Liverpool. The film works on the appeal of its splendid cast of oddballs (my favorite is Nighy whose bends and wobbles can make you seasick) and the skullduggery of Branaghs fun-extermination mission. Too the opportunity to hear so many great songs (some of them not yet written as of 1966-67 when ""Pirate Radio"" takes place) on a theater sound system is not to be overlooked. For its wicked innocence this is the finest rock movie since ""Almost Famous"" which presented rock as a sort of exclusive club with initiation rituals and furious ejections. The two movies travel in opposite directions to arrive at the same conclusion Long live rock. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Jon King to take Lou Dobbs slot Read Next Jon King to take Lou Dobbs slot Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 40527 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 20897 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops 13811 Cop in bikini tackles bad guy Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

"Review In the end Pirate Radio sinks - Mercury News Hot Topics Big Sur fire No-parachute skydive Deadline 29 to Vegas Sheryl Sandbergs Option B Chandra Levy Steve Torrence Ask Amy Comics SV150 Print Email Font ResizeReview In the end Pirate Radio sinksBy Charlie McCollumcmccollummercurynews.comPosted 11/13/2009 120000 AM PSTUpdated 11/13/2009 041053 PM PSTClick photo to enlarge FOCUS FEARTURES Philip Seymour Hoffman and Nick Frost star in ""Pirate Radio"" a film about the ships that illegally broadcast rock music in the U.K. in the 1960s. <<12>>You know a film is in trouble when you and the people around you in the theater start looking at their watches halfway through the movie. In the case of ""Pirate Radio"" which opens today I started glancing at the time well before the midway mark.By all rights ""Pirate Radio"" -- which pays homage to the days in the 1960s when pirate rock radio stations broadcast from ships off the coast of Britain -- should be a rollicking good time. It has a terrific premise. It has wonderful performances from Philip Seymour Hoffman (as the ships token American disc jockey) Bill Nighy (the stations owner-manager) and Rhys Ifans (a legendary British DJ). And it features a 1960s soundtrack to die for with songs by everybody from the Who the Stones and the Kinks to Dusty Springfield Leonard Cohen and Darlene Love.But as a piece of filmmaking ""Pirate Radio"" is a bloated disjointed mess. Even cut by 30 minutes for American release it is still way too long (almost two hours) and the closing credits simply cant come quickly enough.The blame lies squarely on the shoulders of writer-director Richard Curtis who has done admirable work in the past as both a director (""Love Actually"") and as a writer (""Four Weddings and A Funeral"" ""Notting Hill""). He has said in some recent interviews that he wanted to make a rock n roll version of Robert Altmans ""MASH"" and indeed all the elements of an Altman work (overlapping dialogue handheld cameras big cast) are present.Advertisement The problem is that while Altman was a shrewd editor of his work a sure hand when it came to absurdist comedy and a director with a keen sense of pacing Curtis is none of those things and lets his film get out of control quickly. Find things to do Browse our event listings Restaurant listings Movie listings | Movie theaters Concert listings Performing arts listings Hes clearly enamored with some characters who are superfluous to the story and could have easily been trimmed. Other characters are mere cartoons (particularly Kenneth Branagh as the British bureaucrat trying to stop the pirate broadcasts is a cardboard villain). He lets scenes go on far too long. He overuses the split-screen montages that were the lamest part of ""Love Actually."" The nominal dramatic spine of the film (the teenage ""godson"" of Nighys character joins the crew) simply isnt strong enough to hold things together.Moreover the smart humor that was Curtis calling card in previous films is missing in ""Pirate Radio."" Theres no doubt that the DJs who worked on those radio ships were a raucous rebellious bunch enamored of sex drugs and rock n roll. But as written by Curtis the crew members of the good ship Radio Rock are (for the most part) a bunch of oversexed foul-mouthed juvenile delinquents so overloaded with ludicrous quirks that they cease to become characters early on.About the only thing Curtis gets right in terms of channeling ""MASH"" is a misogynistic streak. Curtis has written lovely roles for some very good actresses (Julia Roberts Laura Linney Renee Zellweger Emma Thompson) in the past but here he has nothing to offer Thompson (in an uncredited cameo) the up-and-coming Talulah Riley (the most recent ""Pride amp; Prejudice"") and January Jones (Betty Draper on ""Mad Men""). The zenith of the film comes at the end. It is an absolutely silly sequence (and not in a good Monty Python-esque kind of way) that suggests Curtis had no idea how to wrap up his story. Rock n roll may never die but ""Pirate Radio"" does -- a long slow death. But do grab the soundtrack; its a killer.Contact Charlie McCollum at 408-920-5245.""Pirate Radio"" 1/2 Rating R (for language and some sexual content)Cast Philip Seymour Hoffman Bill Nighy Rhys Ifans Nick Frost Kenneth Branagh Tom Sturridge Talulah Riley and January JonesDirector-writer Richard CurtisRunning time 1 hour 56 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Talend Silicon Valleys latest tech IPO has a strong debutSource Tesla looking at cameras radar in Florida crashCartoons Hillary Clinton makes history Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

Pirate Radio If this is rock Buble is death metal | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesPirate Radio If this is rock Buble is death metalThere isnt a rockin bone in the body of Richard Curtis the British sketch comedy writer turned feel-good filmmaker who would sooner be smothered by puppies than scorched by the devils music.Rhys Ifans sullies himself in this whimper of a rebel film.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Nov. 13 2009 (out of 4)Starring Philip Seymour Hoffman Bill Nighy Kenneth Branagh and Rhys Ifans. Written and directed by Richard Curtis. 116 minutes. At major theatres. 14AThere isnt a rockin bone in the body of Richard Curtis the British sketch comedy writer turned feel-good filmmaker who would sooner be smothered by puppies than scorched by the devils music.Natch the cruel fates being what they are hes the guy who gets to ruin Pirate Radio which has ominously been retitled and drastically recut for North American consumption after failing earlier this year in Blighty under its pulse-quickening original title The Boat That Rocked. Its a grand idea for a movie loosely based on the true story of Radio Caroline a rogue-ship radio station. It operated in the North Sea outside Britain during the stuffier part of the 1960s when the state-owned BBC judged Perry Como to be safer for British ears than the Rolling Stones. Millions of rock fans disagreed and twirled their knobs towards Caroline.Article Continued BelowBut it remains just an idea. If there were awards handed out for the most badly bungled concept Pirate Radio would have to be very much in contention. This chronicle of musical rebellion on the high seas is run aground by the sentimental tosh of the man who gave us Love Actually and who wrote Notting Hill and Four Weddings and a Funeral the DVD versions of which Keith Richards could use to snort cocaine from. Curtis is clearly incapable of writing or directing a scene that has any greater tension than hopping into bed planning a prank muddling a marriage or pondering about paternity. If these guys are rebels then Im Che Guevara.The films two anti-rock bureaucrats are as toothless as a Britney Spears song and not even as funny. Kenneth Branagh plays the main government villain as a shrill caricature while Jack Davenport has the misfortune of playing his sidekick a thug that goes by the rib-tickling name of Twatt.Curtis assembles some of the finest talent on both sides of the Atlantic and then proceeds to waste all of it. From the U.K. theres Bill Nighy Emma Thompson Rhys Ifans Mark Frost and too many others. From the U.S. theres Philip Seymour Hoffman (who looks as if hes in pain) and Mad Mens January Jones who at least gets to remain in the 1960s. Dont forget Down Under Rhys Darby of The Flight of the Conchords gets to sully his reputation too.This film doesnt know whether it wants to be a comedy or a drama. By the time it finally reaches its Titanic-style conclusion you probably wont care.But at least theres the soundtrack of classic rock hits and semi-hits which provides more energy and revolution than anything Curtis has or ever will come up with.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

(Alex Bailey) Joe Neumaier Thursday November 12 2009 543 PM Title Pirate Radio Disk jockeys off the coast of England broadcast banned rock n roll. With Philip Seymour Hoffman. Director Richard Curtis (155). R Language sexuality. At area theaters.Has any disk jockey ever really done a windmill and jammed on an air guitar after putting on a record? If that movie cliche happened it surely wouldve been in the mid-60s when rock felt like it could change the world. The comedy ""Pirate Radio"" tries to capture that moment -- complete with air guitar-playing deejays -- and unapologetically rides a wave of nostalgia but ultimately sinks due to a bloated watery script.Set in 1966 writer-director Richard Curtis music-filled movie has a great real-life setting one of the boats off Englands coast that broadcast then-banned music to Beatles- and Stones-starved British citizens constantly not just during the BBCs two hours of rock. These offshore deejays technically out of reach were the bane of the government but a godsend to teens tuning in their transistors.The movies boat called Radio Rock provides a constant soundtrack for its fictional tale of do-it-yourself revolution. Leading the charge is the Count (Philip Seymour Hoffman) a tubby genial anarchist and the only American alongside a motley collection of disk-jockey misfits including the randy Dr. Dave (Nick Frost) and Gavin Cavanagh (Rhys Ifans) a Jagger-like legend. When the ships owner (Bill Nighy) brings his godson Carl (Tom Sturridge) aboard the floating magical mystery tour begins.Curtis trying hard for an episodic feel -- Robert Altman meets ""American Graffiti"" meets Curtis own ""Love Actually"" -- isnt afraid of ragged edges and that works for a while. As hit after classic-rock hit spins in what eventually feels like the movies only reason for being the shaggy plot boils down to a priggish politician (Kenneth Branagh) trying to shut the boat down and Carls accidental search for his dad (cue Cat Stevens ""Father and Son"" which was actually from 1970 but no matter). The end result of these dilemmas will surprise no one.But Curtis who actually can craft deft characters (""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" ""Notting Hill"") just lets his actors drift and while they come off admirably no one has anything to do. Emma Thompson briefly appears as Carls mother and January Jones (""Mad Men"") is wasted in a walk-on as Elenore the bride of a Radio Rock deejay (she of course arrives accompanied by the Turtles 1968 ""Elenore""). Nighy is as pleasantly lizardy as ever but could just sleepwalk through this and perhaps did.Its all got a great backbeat and you can dance to it but there isnt much to Curtiss rebels except some canned anti-authoritarian sex-drugs-rock n roll rants.

ABOUT THE MOVIEPirate Radio   (out of four)Stars Bill Nighy Philip Seymour Hoffman Rhys Ifans Rhys Darby Tom SturridgeDirector Richard CurtisDistributor Focus FeaturesRating R for language and some sexual content including brief nudityRunning time 1 hour 56 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY More retro than renegade Pirate Radio is buoyed by spirited performances and infectious tunes. This lightweight British comedy is set in 1966 and captures a sense of the era through its costumes production design dialogue and above all its top-notch soundtrack. While the tale of rogue disc jockeys who defied the government and broadcast rock n roll beyond U.K. territorial waters can grow choppy watching it is like lazing on a sunny afternoon with old pals. VIDEO Watch the trailer In the mid-60s while some of the worlds most popular rock bands were homegrown Brits their countrymen had shockingly limited opportunities to hear them on the airwaves. In 1966 the USA had more than 500 radio stations playing The Beatles the Rolling Stones The Who The Kinks and countless other bands. But the government-owned BBC chose to broadcast merely two hours of rock n roll per week to the grooving masses. So rock aficionados took to the high seas broadcasting music from aboard these vessels. Almost as soon as pirate radio made its first splash however the British government fired up to shut it down. Within this real-life atmosphere director Richard Curtis (Love Actually) sets his light and engaging if occasionally sentimental tale. Irreverent characters all the DJs living the life aquatic are a predictably motley but nonetheless endearing crew. Bill Nighy is terrific as Quentin the station owner and imperturbable ships captain. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays a hip dude known as The Count the lone American rocking buccaneer. Accustomed to being the big man on deck he resents the more celebrated Gavin (Rhys Ifans) from the moment the mysterious broadcasting legend saunters coolly aboard. The rest of the quirky gang of rockaholics ranges from pathologically shy to dedicated lotharios - in other words theyre caricatures more than fully drawn characters. But theyre played with so much jaunty appeal that their lack of dimension is a mere blip on the radar. Kenneth Branagh plays a government minister hellbent on pulling the pirate radio stations plug. Mad Mens January Jones has a small part as Elenore the bride-to-be of one of the DJs. Classic rock enthusiasts will want to stick around through the end credit sequence which features an array of album covers. The films original title was The Boat That Rocked. Indeed these freewheeling swinging 60s DJs braved their own Titanic to keep on rocking in the free world.

Media San Francisco Chronicle Pirate Radio Nostalgic comedy. Starring Tom Sturridge Philip Seymour Hoffman Bill Nighy and Talulah Riley. Directed by Richard Curtis. (R. 115 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Seen from a distance 1966 is a neither-fish-nor-foul era. In 1965 there were no drugs black-and-white film and the end of the old. In 1967  there were LSD psychedelic colors and the birth of the new. So what was 1966? Yet people who were there often say that 66 was the best time the height of that decades fun. And now ""Pirate Radio"" has arrived evoking 1966 as the life pinnacle for a group of DJs on a boat broadcasting rock n roll to the United Kingdom. If you want to know years in advance what old-age nostalgia is going to look like for Baby Boomers look no further than ""Pirate Radio"" in which the sun always shines the music is great and the sex is available guilt-free and glorious. This might sound like a sentimental recipe but Richard Curtis who wrote and directed keeps the spirit fresh and anarchic. At one point the American DJ played by Philip Seymour Hoffman observes that its a terrible thing to realize youre living the best days of your life - to know that as youre living them. And with that we realize what Curtis has achieved in ""Pirate Radio."" For all its irreverence and caustic humor this movie is about the recipe for happiness - how sometimes it can all come together friends community excitement and faith in the future.

(Alex Baily/Focus Features/MCT) Photo Alex Bailey MCT Review Tuning into Pirate Radio 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Apparently in England at that time rock n roll could only be played for about an hour a day on the radio. And so pirate stations proliferated broadcasting from offshore to an audience of 25 million people daily. Sustained by advertising these stations were serious business and ""Pirate Radio"" depicts one such station in which a crew and a slate of DJs live together on a big boat hanging out and playing music all day. Life on the boat is seen through the eyes of young Carl (Tom Sturridge) who is sent by his free-living mother to live there for a few months. Carl is a virgin which gives the DJs a problem to be solved in between playing the music of 1966 - and a little from 1969. (Maybe Curtis thought no one would notice the difference.) Yet if ""Pirate Radio"" plays a little fast and loose with the music chronology at least it has the eras look down to a science. Almost every guy on the boat has a haircut something like John Lennons on the back cover of ""Revolver"" (1966). Even more delightful when Carl is finally fixed up with a girl (Talulah Riley) she is a dead ringer for the actress Anna Karina. This is casting on a sophisticated anthropological and socio-historical level folks because if there was one woman on the planet who embodied the style and the fantasy of that particular year it was Karina. A few years earlier it might have been Jackie Kennedy. In 1967 it was probably Marianne Faithfull. But in 1966 if youre an 18-year-old guy and a dead ringer for Anna Karina comes walking through the door youre the happiest (and most nervous) kid on the planet. Curtis who has written a string of superior movies including ""Notting Hill"" and ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" does something quite clever with the story. Essentially he structures the scenes of life on the boat as a series of disparate incidents. Yet he gives the action the illusion of narrative and a feeling of urgency by cutting to the mainland every few minutes to show how the government is planning to shut the station down. Kenneth Branagh with his accustomed brio plays a stuffy English type that he perhaps remembers from his early childhood - a miserably uptight slicked down suit who hates rock n roll and would be happy to see the pirates dead. Hes the villain of the piece but such is the movies good nature that we cant dislike him. He is after all about to get swept away by history. -- Advisory This movie contains sexual situations strong language and drug use.

Photo Credit Alex Bailey Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Pirate Radio"" is a painful little mistake of a movie. Its a salute to jubilant classic rock thats as boring and stiff as a Britney Spears lip-synch concert. Imagine the dullest moments from ""Almost Famous"" and the lamest bits from ""Animal House"" held together with clumsy Frankenstein stitching. Now punch yourself in the face. There you go. Back in 1966 the BBC was Britains primary source of broadcast music and its programmers rarely played anything edgier than Perry Como. Antiestablishment types found a way to give the people what they craved erecting unlicensed radio towers on ships outside the nations jurisdiction. Radio Rock based on a decrepit fishing trawler in the North Sea blasted the Who Jimi Hendrix and the Rolling Stones to a grateful nation. In the films nostalgia-saturated view it serves as an unofficial soundtrack to the Swinging 60s. Grateful dolly birds in miniskirts arrive by the boatful for conjugal visits with their idols. Whenever the storys overlapping sketches wander into a dead end -- frequently -- we get a montage of shopgirls or students twisting to prohibited pop songs. This is not an image that grows more interesting with repetition. The film boasts a star-studded cast some much better than others. Philip Seymour Hoffman oozes panache in the role of a scruffy Yank DJ Bill Nighy is breezy and strange as the Carnaby Street cadaver who runs the station and Kenneth Branagh finds the fun in a stale characterization as the Puritan Cabinet minister who has sworn to shut them down. Writer/director Richard Curtis (""Love Actually"") serves his players poorly however shuffling them through heavy-handed comic sketches. Branaghs character has an underling named Twatt because shouting that again and again is intended to be funny. Even Branagh cant make that work. ""Pirate Radio"" drifts here and there without a clear destination. Beyond setting his characters against the stuffy authorities and letting them dabble with sex drugs and excess on the boat Curtis has no built-in trajectory in mind for any of them. The main action of the story follows a teen played by Tom Sturridge visiting his godfather (Nighy) on shipboard. Through him were introduced to the strenuously quirky DJ crew. Pudgy Nick Frost plays a lumpish Casanova with schoolboy swagger Rhys Ifans is an incorrigible rule breaker with an ego the size of a Roman emperors and Rhys Darby plays a sad-sack New Zealander. The DJs carry on as if they are messiahs with a mission to save the planet a notion that could be funny if only Curtis pricked it and let out the pomposity. PIRATE RADIO  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating R for language and sexual content including brief nudity. The anything-goes setting would seem like a great launching pad for witty shenanigans. No such luck. The crew makes silly faces riffs air guitars and cavorts with boisterous abandon guided more by the films desperate need for excitement than by genuine euphoria. Watching it is like observing an office party where everyone is trying to convince the others theyre having a great great time. There is one gloriously transporting moment though. At one point the cast breaks into a mad dance number on deck and Nighy the most restrained of actors cuts loose. The man may look like a ghost from a Dickensian graveyard but he can boogaloo like nobodys business.

""Pirate Rock"" is tuneful but irritatingly upbeat.By Steven Rea Inquirer Movie CriticPosted November 13 2009Awash in nostalgia and amped-up male camaraderie Richard Curtis Pirate Radio takes a great story - the hugely popular offshore radio stations that illegally broadcast pop and rock in 1960s Britain - and turns it into an aggressively irritating floating frat-party romp.Bobbing on an ebullient soundtrack of the Kinks the Who ""I Feel Free"" and ""A Whiter Shade of Pale"" Pirate Radio plops a gang of misfit DJs down on a red-hulled ship in the North Sea where they spin vinyl and speak naughtily to schoolgirls nurses and university students - all of them listening giddily to the rock-and-roll the government doesnt want them to hear.Yes in the birthplace of the British Invasion the land that launched the Beatles and the Stones the licensed radio stations of the day aired next to no rock at all. And so a small flotilla of renegade radio outlets took to the high seas and found an audience of 25 million listeners (or so says the films context-heavy opening credits) happy to tune in.And every one of those 25 million it seems shows up in the merry montages that run from beginning to end in Pirate Radio shots of frugging Brits grooving to the beat and nodding approvingly to the provocative patter of the men at the mike.Bill Nighy sporting a paisley ascot and mock patrician airs is Quentin the man in charge of the good ship Radio Rock. The stations two big stars are a blustery Yank dubbed the Count (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and Gavin (Rhys Ifans) a smooth smoky-voiced gent with an ardent female following.Also onboard an enigmatic late-night DJ (Ralph Brown of Withnail amp; I) a nutty New Zealander (Rhys Darby from Flight of the Conchords) the thick ""Thick Kevin"" (Tom Brooke) a few other disc jockeys and engineers a news reader and Quentins starry-eyed still-a-virgin godson Carl (Tom Sturridge). There is only one woman on the crew the cook Felicity (Katherine Parkinson) - and shes a lesbian.Nonetheless the occasional groupie clambers aboard Enter the mod gamines played by Gemma Arterton and Talulah Riley and enter Emma Thompson as Carls mum checking up on her son - and on Quentin - in trendy sunglasses and couture.While the music clothes posters and album covers are all rigorously of the day Curtis dialogue jumps around in anachronistic fits. The expression ""think outside the box"" - a phrase certainly never uttered in 1966 - springs from one actors mouth and other vernacular rings conspicuously wrong.Curtis the wordsmith behind Love Actually Notting Hill and Four Weddings and a Funeral doesnt do period piece well - even if the period in question is only 40-odd years ago.And then theres Kenneth Branagh especially cartoonish as a British cabinet minister determined to bring an end to Radio Rock broadcasts.Maybe I took such a passionate dislike to this impossibly upbeat film - benign really in character and concept - because it mocks one of my treasured albums of yesteryear (OK Ill fess up) the second Incredible String Band disc. But actually that throwaway joke comes near the movies end. I was squirming in my seat long before then loathing each and every radio pirate parading on the poop deck.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

""Pirate Radio"" Movie Review -- You know the guy. He plays air guitar on the dance floor. Sings along in his Prius way too loud to ""Under My Thumb."" Says things like ""Hey rockin PowerPoint on those third-quarter numbers man -- you rule"" Pirate Radio (R) Focus (116 min.) Directed by Richard Curtis. With Philip Seymour Hoffman Bill Nighy and Tom Sturridge. Now playing in New Jersey. STEPHEN WHITTYS RATING TWO STARS Ratings note The film contains sexual situations strong language and brief nudity. He is a rock n roll poser -- like Richard Curtis. The 53-year-old filmmaker got his start in the early 1980s writing for the very funny ""Blackadder"" television series in Britain. After years in television he wrote ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" which kick-started his movie career. But Curtis has not been a particularly daring writer -- the ""Bridget Jones"" adaptations and the rather flat ""Notting Hill"" were his work too. Now with ""Pirate Radio"" he has tried to write a call-to-rebellion and its about as wild as some fellow in a gray ponytail telling you about that really cool Troggs show he saw back in 65. ""Pirate Radio"" is the story of an odd footnote in pop history. British bands were ruling the airwaves but the hidebound BBC broadcast only two hours of rock a week. Seeing a need some rebellious disc jockeys filled it by working from boats anchored offshore. It was a neat idea -- and might have been a neat idea for a movie back in 1966 or so when all of this was going on. But the film seems a little after-the-fact now while Curtis (directing for only the second time after ""Love Actually"") feels behind the times. If rock n roll is about joy and rebellion then a movie about it should be joyful and rebellious too. But ""Pirate Radio"" is staid and stolid. The set-up is artificial with school dropout Carl (Tom Sturridge) being sent to one of the ""pirate"" ships currently captained by his godfather Quentin (Bill Nighy). He soon becomes the mascot of a motley crew of DJs and with their tutelage finally loses his virginity and finds himself. But Sturridge is such a cold bowl of porridge he seems no livelier at the end of this ""coming of age"" than he was at the beginning. And the disc jockeys are mostly unremarkable (with Philip Seymour Hoffman basically recycling his Lester Bangs act from ""Almost Famous""). At least Nighy is here and as always hes a delight. The slightly burned-out rocker is a trope hes trotted out before (in Curtis ""Love Actually"" and the sublime ""Still Crazy"") but no one does it better. Hes funny just entering a room and when he actually does something -- like a few dance moves -- the film begins to work. Yet despite trims (about 20 minutes since its British debut in April) much of ""Pirate Radio"" is slow obvious going. Reaction shots of listeners bursting with overdone glee abound; plot points are telegraphed; music cues are dully on the nose (and occasionally anachronistic). And what the film does get right it doesnt comprehend. One of the ironies of the 60s was that even as these white male rebels were demanding freedom it was mostly for other white male rebels. They said they wanted a revolution but they never doubted it would end with them in charge. Yet while the film reflects that arrogance it never -- like ""Mad Men"" say -- actually sees it. Curtis in fact seems to share the DJs chauvinism. The only woman on board this ship is a cook (and a frumpy lesbian by the way); ever-willing ""birds"" are imported regularly and passed around like joints. No one takes any woman seriously Curtis least of all. In ""Pirate Radio"" females are faithless and male bonding is all. That sexism may be in a way the most ""classic rock"" thing here; its certainly a sentiment shared by half the Rolling Stones catalog. But endorsing it only makes this ode to cultural change feel more off-key. Like the fellow who cranks up ""Wont Get Fooled Again"" while driving to his job at the bank ""Pirate Radio"" sings the lyrics without understanding them.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + Sometimes history just isnt as much fun as it should be. ""Pirate Radio a rowdy mostly hilarious British comedy-drama about the offshore radio stations that blared rock n roll to a desperate young UK audience in the 1960s would much rather show us a good time than stick to the facts. Writer-director Richard Curtis (""Love Actually) has made a party not a movie and if the party goes on much too long at least the guests are great company and the hosts taste in music is impeccable.Also You can get a contact high just looking at the fashions. Not bad for a movie that takes place on a boat.Some background for Yanks The mid-60s were a time of some of the greatest early British rock and BBC Radio played none of it. If you wanted to hear the Beatles the Stones the Who - let alone the galvanic sounds pouring across the Atlantic from America - you had to tune in one of the handful of illegal stations broadcasting from rusty repurposed fishing tubs in the international waters of the North Sea.Pirate stations like Radio Caroline and Wonderful Radio London were listened to by millions even as Beeb officials and government ministers fumed and plotted to put the pirates out of business. ""Pirate Radio - edited down from a longer British cut called ""The Boat That Rocked and presumably retitled to net careless US Johnny Depp fans - takes all this and fictionalizes it with high spirits and a nose for the tall tale.Carl (Tom Sturridge) is our designated innocent expelled from school and sent by his mother to live with family friend Quentin (Bill Nighy) aboard the good ship Radio Rock. Quentin - played with slumming aristocratic weariness as only Nighy can - oversees the crew of bad-boy deejays tubby satyr Dave (Nick Frost) hapless Simon (Chris ODowd) Thick Kevin (Tom Brooke) space-case Bob (Ralph Brown) sexy Midnight Mark (Tom Wisdom) and so forth. The king of these waves is The Count (Philip Seymour Hoffman) a grandiloquent hard-rocking American based loosely on a Radio One deejay named Emperor Rosko and played by Hoffman as an exuberant extension of his Lester Bangs in ""Almost Famous.Like that movie ""Pirate Radio has an affection for rocks lasting truths and trivialities and what it lacks in fidelity it makes up for with its soundtrack of achingly resonant period classics. (Many of them released later than 1966 and thus impossible for the films deejays to be spinning. Are you complaining? Im not.) ""Crimson and Clover ""The Letter ""Friday on My Mind ""A Whiter Shade of Pale - I think I won this compilation as the 10th caller in to WRKO back in 1968. When January Jones of ""Mad Men turns up as a listener in love with at least one of the deejays shes named Elenore only so the Turtles deathless song of that name can grace the film.Speaking of which The treatment of women in ""Pirate Radio is defiantly pre-feminist with ""visiting day on the boat an excuse to shag a groupie or two and much made of Carls virginity and loss thereof. A few of the ladies keep up - Talulah Riley as a schoolgirl named Marianne (cue Leonard Cohens ""So Long Marianne) and Emma Thompson elegantly tarty as Carls mum - but mostly Radio Rock is a boys club happily dedicated to the founding principles of sex and drugs and rock n roll.As such the heroes really need a straight man to rebel against so ""Pirate Radio gives us Kenneth Branagh enjoyably hamming away as a fussy government minister hellbent on shutting the pirates down. He has a minion (Jack Davenport) to whom writer-director Curtis has given a funny name and not much to do.That shaggy-dog looseness permeates the whole movie which rambles into what seems like a fourth act then a fifth until the characters are clearly having more fun than we are. ""Pirate Radio turns into yet another British ensemble comedy about colorful eccentrics and while you dont much mind - not with Hoffman and Nighy aboard - the real story of British pirate radio goes over the side. Too bad; someone should really make a movie about it someday.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. For more on movies go to www.boston.com/movienation. (c) Copyright 2009 Globe Newspaper Company.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Do you like montages but grow bored with the tedious plot bits in between? Then Pirate Radio is the movie for you. Set in 1966 during what an opening title helpfully labels ""the greatest era for British rock n roll"" the movie takes place almost entirely on a massive red-hulled ship that has been converted into a radio station for the purpose of promulgating the devils music to Britains unsuspecting populace who would otherwise be limited to the rock-free BBC. Kenneth Branagh copping Basil Fawltys mannerisms so blatantly that he should be paying John Cleese royalties plays the government minister obsessed with shutting the pirates down and Bill Nighy plays the stations owner a droll toff fond of scarves and wasp-waisted suits. Curtis stocks the boat with a crew of fine comic actors mostly playing the DJs of Radio Rock Rhys Darby Nick Frost and Philip Seymour Hoffman essentially doing a more animated take on Almost Famous Lester Bangs. But while they successfully convey a sense of shipboard camaraderie enhanced by the boats no-girls-allowed rule Curtis seems to have no idea how to take advantage of their talents. Darby plays an awkward semi-square a la Flight Of The Conchords and Chris ODowd essentially Xeroxes his character from The IT Crowd. The driving force behind a wave of blandly successful British comedies that include Love Actually and the Bridget Jones films Curtis evidently has the pull to purchase a dream cast but not the ingenuity to take advantage of it. Pirate Radio tries to create an atmosphere of boudoir farce mingled with love-generation libertinage but while the men seem like randy wolves the women are merely rancid disloyal disingenuous creatures whose actions seem untroubled by any kind of higher thought. Mad Mens January Jones gets the worst role as a guileless tart who marries ODowds loveless schnook solely to get close to Rhys Ifans swaggering popinjay. Its bad enough that Curtis has made one more vanilla boomer comedy mindlessly touting the freedoms of the 60s but he cant even keep his facts straight. A good many of the songs he relies on to push his torpid narrative forward were released well after the films events took place and where he departs from the real events that inspired his story he invariably does so in the service of making them less interesting. For a movie that ostensibly promotes individuality Pirate Radio manifests precious little.

Pirate Radio Fair Director Richard Curtis. Cast Bill Nighy Tom Sturridge Philip Seymour Hoffman. Rating R for language and some sexual content including brief nudity. RELATED British comedies Rock movies Qamp;A Bill Nighy It never really finds one. Oh whats here is agreeable enough floating along on a sea of great classic rock. It may be cheating to let the music shape the emotion of the film giving overly obvious cues as to how we are suppose to react and feel. But when the music includes the Kinks the Rolling Stones and the like operating at the height of their powers long before the laziness brought on by riding around in the back of limos set in its hard to complain too much. Still if youre looking for a compelling story that hangs together from beginning to end well ""Pirate Radio"" isnt that kind of movie. It flits from scene to scene having fun along the way never really adding up to much and not minding a bit. If things start to lag throw on some Otis Redding. The movie is set mostly aboard a ship anchored in the North Sea in the 1960s just outside British jurisdiction. The location is important; this way the on-board station can beam pop music to the masses in England who cant get it over the airwaves any other way. Quentin (Bill Nighy) the stations owner oversees a rag-tag bunch of eccentric DJs including the Count (Philip Seymour Hoffman) the lone American on board; Gavin (Rhys Ifans) the Counts coal-throated rival; portly Dave (Nick Frost) and more. Quentins godson Carl (Tom Sturridge) arrives on board freshly expelled from school and sent to sea by his mother (Emma Thompson) to straighten himself out. ""Spectacular mistake"" Quentin terms it and hes right. Meanwhile on shore uptight minister of something-or-other Sir Alistair Dormandy (Kenneth Branagh) is charged with shutting down the pirate radio stations a task he takes overly seriously. He enlists the aid of his eager lieutenant Twatt (Jack Davenport) and together they set out to silence the music taking altogether too much delight in doing so. We dont see a lot of their efforts actually. Writer and director Richard Curtis just drops in on them time to time. At times you almost forget theyre a part of the story until Twatt shows up in Dormandys office to again tell him that the latest sure-fire solution has failed. The real action of course is on the boat where plot points include Carl trying to lose his virginity Carl trying to find his father a marriage with a twist (not involving Carl) and other stand-alone set pieces that are often amusing if not especially enlightening. What ""Pirate Radio"" gets right is the DJs love of music their absolute obsession with it. Its all played way over the top (Hoffman in particular could have used some reining in) but these are great songs and these guys believe in them. Ultimately however ""Pirate Radio"" is less like the truly great music it celebrates and more like a three-minute bubblegum single something you enjoy while youre hearing it but forget about almost as soon as its over.

"Pirate Radio | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; pirate-radio ) Pirate Radio (United Kingdom/Germany/United States/France 2009) November 10 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli Despite arriving on North American screens mid-way through the month of November with a cast that features three previous Academy Award nominees (Philip Seymour Hoffman Kenneth Branagh Emma Thompson) and a similarly honored writer/director (Richard Curtis) Pirate Radio is not being touted as Oscar bait. In fact it comes to the U.S. with a less-than-stellar pedigree having received lukewarm reviews during its U.K. theatrical run earlier this year and having subsequently been re-cut at Focus Features request. The result although uneven is generally enjoyable especially for those who attend with the right mindset. Character and narrative are secondary concerns for a movie primarily driven to provide a Valentine to 60s rock-and-roll. Its 1966 and the young people of Great Britain are less-than-happy with the domestic radio situation which is almost all talk and news (with a little jazz thrown in for good measure). Into this breach come the offshore pirate radio stations the most infamous of which is ""Radio Rock"" a 24/7 rock-and-roll operation that saturates the airwaves from a ship anchored in international waters and boasts a listening audience north of 20 million. Radio Rock is the brainchild of Quentin (Bill Nighy) and features some of the best known disc jockeys including an American known only as The Count (Philip Seymour Hoffman); the world-renowned Gavin (Rhys Ifans); Bob (Ralph Brown) the 3-6 a.m. guy whom almost no one has seen; and Simon (Chris ODowd) whos convinced no one likes him. Into this setting comes Carl (Tom Sturridge). After being kicked out of school Carls mom (Emma Thompson) sends him to spend some time on the Radio Rock ship under the watchful eye of his godfather Quentin. Life aboard the ship is all sex drugs and rock-and-roll (although the sex only arrives once every two weeks when a boatload of women arrive for overnight stays). Carl a virgin is at something of a disadvantage when it comes to the opposite sex but various members of the crew set out to help him remedy the situation. Meanwhile on land cabinet member Sir Alistair Dormandy (Kenneth Branagh) announces his determination to shut down Radio Rock. Since what theyre doing is breaking no current laws he hires the unfortunately named Twatt (Jack Davenport) to find a loophole that he can turn into a noose. For the most part Pirate Radio called The Boat that Rocked during its U.K. run is a series of poorly connected vignettes about life aboard the ship during a time when the social views of the government were at odds with those of its younger citizens. As Dormandy and Twatt seek to stifle Radio Rock we are shown a cross-section of British people enjoying the music in different settings. Some of the episodes work (such as the visit to the ship by Carls mother); others exhibit forced comedy that really isnt funny (Carls attempts to lose his virginity the ""duel"" between The Count and Gavin). The characters are mostly likable but none exhibits much depth. The best comedic elements derive from Kenneth Branaghs satirization of 60s stuffed shirt politicians. At times its as if hes channeling John Cleese in the way he sends them up. He also has some great lines about the role of government. Ultimately however Pirate Radio is more about the music than it is about anything else. Hardly a scene goes by without at least one classic rock song being played. There are reportedly about 60 clips (ranging from a few bars to full singles) in the movie which makes it a pretty comprehensive survey of the music of the era with artists ranging as far and wide as Dusty Springfield Herb Alpert Cream The Who Cat Stevens The Beach Boys and The Moody Blues. Without such a rich and diverse soundtrack theres little doubt that Pirate Radio would have been considerably less endearing and enjoyable. Of the features on Richard Curtis resume (he wrote Four Weddings and a Funeral and Bridget Jones Diary and wrote and directed Love Actually) this is arguably the least substantive. Some of the marketing material is hyping the ""based on a true story"" aspect of the movie although in fact this was always intended to tell the tale of a fictional pirate radio boat. Some aspects are loosely based on historical events and some of the characters are composites of real people but Pirate Radio should not be mistaken for anything other than a creation of a writers imagination. The distributors apparently would like us to believe these people actually existed and Radio Rock occupies an almost mythical position in recent British pop history. Films with large ensemble casts rarely afford opportunities for individual standout performances and this is no exception. Bill Nighy is amusing but hardly reaches the heights he scaled for his small role in Love Actually. Philip Seymour Hoffman is very good in what may be his most limited non-cameo since Twister. Tom Sturridge who is the closest Pirate Radio has to a lead is a little on the limp side. Those who appreciate trivia will note that this is the first movie in which both Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson have both appeared since the dissolution of their marriage (although they do not share any scenes). Two obvious cinematic references came to mind while I was watching Pirate Radio. The first Pump up the Volume also deals with issues of censorship and free speech over the public airwaves and as is the case here it sets up a radio pirate as the champion of a group of individuals whose voices and opinions are often ignored by those in power. The second and more unfortunate reference is Titanic. The scenes with a boat sinking in the North Sea are simply too familiar for the association not to be made. One of the biggest complaints about the U.K. release of the film was that its too long and even though the American version is shorter by 15 minutes it still seems like theres too little content for such a robust running time. Nevertheless the music is great the comedy provides occasional laughs and theres nothing fundamentally wrong with the movie. Distilled to its essence it represents a respectable diversion.

Brits of a certain boomer age will remember Radio Caroline and other renegade stations broadcasting rock amp; roll 24/7 from ships just outside the jurisdiction of a British government that still limited BBC airtime for such noise to two hours a week. The export title Pirate Radio with its hint of Capt. Jack Sparrow doesnt mean much in this nostalgic episodic ensemble comedy from writer-director Richard Curtis (Love Actually) For all the supposed anarchy aboard the creaky vessel that broadcasts the fictional Radio Rock theres something very old-school frat-house about the shipmates -- U.K. blokes all of them except for Philip Seymour Hoffman as the chunky furry American deejay who calls himself the Count and a lone minor woman (Katherine Parkinson) whose self-announced distinguishing characteristic is that shes a lesbian. This movie is like that -- each player is given a cute trait (Bill Nighy is the posh swinging shipowner Rhys Ifans is the Counts preening deejay competitor etc.) and then shuffled through a string of bawdy escapades. (Its a shock to see Mad Mens January Jones as a sunny bosomy groupie who boards the boat.) Pirate Radio is in the end about as rock-revolutionary as a tea break. But the choppy production floats on a great soundtrack (the real pirates are the Rolling Stones) and is buoyed by an inviting cast including Kenneth Branagh as a British-government priss hell-bent on shutting down the infernal radio station. Its only rock amp; roll but he doesnt like it.

Writer-director Richard Curtis paying homage to the shaggy renegade disc jockeys spinning rock n roll from ships anchored in the North Sea of England in the mid-1960s acknowledges as much on the deleted-scenes portion of the DVD which runs almost a full hour. One could start a rather debilitating drinking game based upon the number of times he says ""cutting this"" or ""trimming that"" broke his heart.Among the cutting-room-floor moments not in either version sadly an homage to the Beatles delivered by Philip Seymour Hoffman (as the Yank DJ called the Count) in front of Abbey Road studios; a flashback involving Rhys Ifans dancing with another man in a South American bar to the Rolling Stones ""Get Off My Cloud""; late-night sabotage conducted aboard a competitors vessel a segment that runs almost the length of a sitcom episode; and a wrenching scene in which a heartbroken and betrayed DJ named Simon (played by Chris ODowd) lip-synchs the entirety of Lorraine Ellisons pleading soul gem ""Stay With Me (Baby)."" Which is to say nothing of the snips made before the film was shipped here from England and watered down further still (sorry Yanks but bid farewell to the scene in which dozens of naked women restage the Jimi Hendrix Experiences Electric Ladyland cover).I mention the outtakes and alterations only by way of explaining why after watching the DVD Pirate Radio feels so slight in its current incarnation. Shorn of the scenes that actually put meat on its characters frail bones the resulting product is vaguely cute and wholly insubstantial little more than a randomly assembled hodge-podge of scenes crammed in and yanked out that amount to yet another movie about rebellious young men sticking it to The Grumpy Old Man--this time with a tacked-on Titanic climax.The sinking ship here is named Radio Rock so modeled after the real-life Radio Caroline which sent ashore a nonstop soundtrack of Kinks Stones Otis Redding Beach Boys Box Tops the Troggs and the Who--all the music being ignored by state-sponsored radio which initially found rock n roll a noxious tonic during the mid-1960s. In Curtiss tame version of events the music reaches cutesy teenyboppers who secretly share a bottle of wine (oh my) and a single cigarette (oh no) by the transistors dim glow. (Oh and no Beatles--in 1966 no less. Damned licensing rights.) Still its the music that propels the film forward--one golden oldie after another after another a Big Chill on the high seas.Curtis has decked out his ship with a cozy set (a sprawl of leather couches mahogany desks and beds for everyone) and stockpiled it with actors whose research stopped and started with a screening of Good Morning Vietnam. Theres Hoffman doing his bang-up Lester Bangs again as he squares off against Ifanss impossibly hep Gavin. Theres Flight of the Conchords manager Murray Rhys Darby yet again the butt of a joke he only thinks he gets. And theres Nick Frost showing off far too much of his hot fuzz in a bit of bedroom farce so wildly original it feels like an outtake from a randy episode of Threes Company. To the mix sprinkle in the dandy station owner (Bill Nighy skinny legs and all) the mop-topped boy exiled by his mommy (Tom Sturridge) the creepy Cat Stevens look-alike who spins early-morning music and comes and goes like a ghost (Ralph Brown) the leather-panted monosyllabic sex god (Tom Wisdom) and a few women who stick around just long enough to make the walk of shame down the gangplank (among them Mad Mens January Jones who cant even muster the effort to look disinterested).The episodes aboard the boat are occasionally interrupted by the government henchmen who intend to muzzle the outlaw broadcasters and shake their clammy fists at ""the drug-takers law-breakers and bottom-breaking fornicators."" The pair consists of a starched-collared toothbrush-mustached bureaucrat named Sir Alistair Dormandy (Kenneth Branagh) and his aide-de-camp the officious Mr. Twatt (Jack Davenport) so named because the mere word clearly gives Curtis a fit of the giggles. Hence its copious use as a punch line in the absence of actual cleverness.But what does that Twatt find so offensive anyway? The intended debauchery is diluted; the decadence tamed. Here are more than a dozen men charged only with playing rock n roll and talking dirty to Mother England in shifts and they kill their time by drinking a few beers supping some tea and engaging in a little banal truth-or-dare. The sex is polite entirely beneath the sheets or off-screen. Theres not a whiff of dope on the ship just the offhand talk of spleefs. Only the music endures; not even so powerful a man as Richard Curtis--maker of Four Weddings and a Funeral Notting Hill and Love Actually--can outmuscle rock n roll.

Its a cripplingly self-conscious and self-satisfied tribute to the roistering last days of offshore British mid-60s pirate radio before the meanies from the ministry pulled the plugs. Its also the kind of musical comedy where the actors seem to be having more fun than any audience could ever share. This overlong poorly paced and slackly directed ship-bound farrago not only wastes its treasury of golden oldies - Hendrix Kinks Small Faces etc - but magically contrives to reduce the chaotic creative spirit of the sexual and cultural revolution to a mere mechanical catalogue of trite and surprisingly sentimental sex-drugs-and-rock n roll cliches each fatally underlined by multiple and repetitive reaction shots.If there are compensations they come courtesy of a few diverting performances. The movies depressingly few incidences of genuine feeling come from Tom Sturridge who is sweet and appealing as the public schoolboy taken under the wing of his godfather ships captain and Radio Rock boss Quentin played by Bill Nighy as a self-parody in made-to-measure Regency-collared suits. Philip Seymour Hoffman does a turn as the radical Emperor Rosko-like  DJ in rivalry with Rhys Ifanss self-serving immoralist Gavin. Elsewhere pickings are slim  the talented Ralph Brown is wasted - hes cast as Wee Small Hours Bob a misjudged amalgam presumably of Whispering Bob Harris and dysarthric Danny from Withnail amp; I - and the same is doubly true of such comic talents as Chris ODowd Rhys Darby and Nick Frost.

I would ideally have liked to have seen this material in the final film but sadly the MTV generation (to which I belong) seem to barely make it through an episode of The Simpsons without loosing their concentration. I see nothing wrong with a three-hour film if thats what is needed to convey the directors vision and I find it quite disgusting that there is so much pressure for films to be trimmed just for the sake of reaching the magic one hour thirty minutes. As far as the film itself goes - flawless. Stunning cast including many actors I didnt know such as the brilliant Ike Hamilton. Lovely cinematography. Brilliant sound track and a great story.

(By the way I am 26 so have no memory of the original station) I did enjoy the cutaway shots of the listeners - they gave me a rest from the un-story and provided perhaps the only believable parts of the film Tunes were quality yes but in a film like this that is surely to be expected? There were so many pointless parts to the story like the squirm-worthy poorly acted kid and the government bloke called Twt which could only go to decrease the films credibility. And the ship sinking from some unknown unexplained entity? Please. To conclude even taking escapism into account it was a disappointing take on a film that could have been truly great. Like a man with a limp handshake youve got to do a lot to make up for this Mr Curtis. As someone else said roll on the remakeFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 26 2009TheresaFeaturedAbsolutely loved it.

The characters have no character and I was waiting for the sinking with hope that would be the end but no - it just gets worse - sinking deeper into a pathetic plot which it seems the director does not know how to end.

In a way its ideal The soundtrack is wonderful and you could get way with a couple of sets.. It wouldnt be difficult to recruit people and pay them the minimum wage to throw buckets of water onto the stage for the sinking scenes. Arguably those are most of the film but it dud sort of capture a certain anarchic spirit. Obviously there were so many inaccuracies in this sort of Heartbeat on the ocean portrayal of the Sixties even down to the semi-detached house at the beginning of the film having horrible uPVC windows and the Routemaster bus sporting neon interior lights.

The fact that Nighy kept disappearing off set to show his niece around his trailer also norsed things up. Dont try to pin it all on Curtis he was let down by a lot of people. They know who they are.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 4 2009rubbisherFeaturedDear Sarah life is obviously not too short to criticise comedies as many people still alive have demonstrated. Isnt talking about films interesting? You seem to think so by participating in this forum. I think we are using different definitions of forced. There seems to me a difference between artifice good and forced qualities bad. One of the forced ideas was the admittedly quite exciting contest up the mast which had no organic connection to the feelings of revenge expressed by the Emperor Roscoe character. Anyone involved in creating comedy will say that comedy is a serious business; the director did not take this film seriously; it was never clear whether we were to laugh at the characters or with them. What do you think? What are some of the films you like? I like Mike Leigh films especially Life is Sweet and Career Girls.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 4 2009TrixyFeaturedGhastly loathsome film.

Sex drugs and rock n roll plus a heavy dose of Swinging 60s nostalgia fuel ""The Boat That Rocked"" Richard Curtis hymn to the wild days of U.K. pirate radio. More reminiscent of his eccentric TV comedies (""The Vicar of Dibley"" ""Mr. Bean"") than his bigscreen romancers ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and ""Notting Hill"" Curtis second outing as writer-director throws together a large cast of wackos on a boat off the east coast of Blighty. Pic generally stays afloat on the strength of its characters but sometimes threatens to sink under its overlong running time and vignettish structure. Heavily promoted retro laffer which launches April 1 in the U.K. and thereafter Down Under and across Europe should do OK based on Curtis name though it lacks the universal appeal of his first helming outing ""Love Actually."" Very Brit-specific item is likely to do more modest biz when it sails Stateside Aug. 28. Though it had been around for a while British pirate radio -- a direct result of pubcaster BBCs government-sanctioned monopoly on broadcasting -- mushroomed during the mid-60s following the explosion of Britpop/rock which the conservative BBC Radio hardly played. Operating from boats outside British territorial waters pirates beamed a 24/7 diet of popular music to as many as 25 million listeners (half the U.K. population) before the government effectively crushed the pirates with legislation in August 1967. Many DJs migrated to BBC Radio which gradually bowed to popular pressure but only six years later was its broadcasting monopoly officially ended. Its 1966 as the film opens and the Beeb is still airing less than 45 minutes of pop each day. But on Radio Rock (based on the famous Radio Caroline) which operates from a rusty old fishing trawler in the North Sea the party is in swing around the clock. On board upper-class twit Quentin (Bill Nighy) rules a raggedy bunch of dope-smoking sex-starved DJs who are national idols in defiance of government minister Dormandy (Kenneth Branagh) whos bent on shutting down the ""sewer of dirty commercialism and no morals."" Among the vinyl-spinners are the Count (Philip Seymour Hoffman) a grizzled Yank who wants to be the first person to broadcast the F-word on British radio; tubby Dave (Nick Frost ""Hot Fuzz"") who fancies himself a ladies man; seriously spacey Thick Kevin (Tom Brooke); melancholy Irishman Simon (Chris ODowd); unloved Kiwi Angus (Rhys Darby ""The Flight of the Conchords""); silent lothario Mark (Tom Wisdom); and the boats sole distaffer Felicity (Katherine Parkinson) ""a lesbian who cooks."" Standing in for the audience is Quentins young fresh-faced godson Carl (Tom Sturridge) who arrives on Radio Rock one stormy night. Awed by the laddish atmosphere on board Carl is gradually accepted by the team. Pic shifts back and forth between the boat where Dave is doing his best to relieve Carl of his virginity and London where the fanatical Dormandy bullies his assistant (Jack Davenport) into finding loopholes to sink the pirates. Curtis also cuts in dozens of tiny snapshots of 60s Britain -- teens secretaries and the like listening to the outlawed radio -- expertly designed and garbed by production designer Mark Tildesley costume designer Joanna Johnston and makeup/hair designer Christine Blundell. Curtis background as a sketch writer has never been clearer than here The nearest thing to a throughline is Carls sentimental education and the growing suspicion that one of the men on the boat may be the father he never knew. This strand is resolved near the end by a classy cameo from Emma Thompson as his airy mom though by then its almost lost amid a number of smaller narratives including the rivalry between the Count and star DJ Gavin (Rhys Ifans in the pics wackiest perf). After a lively opening hour the pic starts to lose its sparkle as Curtis tries to develop the subplots at the expense of the scripts comic buoyancy; the film could easily lose a half-an-hour to its benefit. Though the tempo picks up again in the final 40 minutes the movies fragile sketch structure almost breaks under the mini-""Titanic"" setpiece of the final reels. For a script that relies more on character-driven than situational comedy its the perfs that count and these are thankfully strong. As the devil-may-care Count Hoffman melds well with the Brit cast though its Nighy who predictably steals the show with his uniquely dry delivery. Branagh every inch an old-style stiff-upper-lip Brit starts as a caricature (""We have their testicles in our hands and it feels good"") but later adds a touch of genuinely menacing ballast. Amid a colorful cast young Sturridge is excellent as Carl. The soundtrack overdoes the Little England parody at times but more successfully deploys a host of 60s pop/rock classics laid over musical montages in which Emma E. Hickoxs antsy editing cleverly makes the cast almost seem to dance. TV d.p. Danny Cohens mobile widescreen lensing of the tiny claustrophobic boat is far from the warm vistas of ""Love Actually"" but fits the edgier subject matter. Though it positively reeks of the 60s ""The Boat That Rocked"" lacks the sheer grit and darker underbelly of Michael Winterbottoms 70s equivalent ""24 Hour Party People."" It also isnt quite the timely anti-establishment comedy it promises to be at the start but its as close as any comedy by a middle-class entertainer like Curtis is likely to come. A recut version of the film (19 minutes shorter than the 134-minute U.K. version) was released Nov. 13 Stateside by Focus Features under the title ""Pirate Radio.""
