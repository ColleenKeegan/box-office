The Vera Hruba Ralston of her time Madonna has persisted in making movies despite all evidence that this is one medium in which no one wants to see or hear her. Likely to join the stars cinematic hall of ill fame that includes ""Shanghai Surprise"" ""Whos That Girl"" and ""The Next Best Thing"" is director-scenarist-spouse Guy Ritchies ""Swept Away"" though the badmouthing is likely to overshadow whats actually onscreen -- a simple misfire rather than a world-class fiasco. This misguided attempt to remake Lina Wertmullers corrosive 1974 satire as a wistful romance is only unintentionally funny in the last reel alternating between the painless and turgid until then. Anticipatory bad press has probably already killed pics theatrical prospects; some costs should be recouped in ancillary. Wertmuller cemented her brief mid-70s vogue as an international arthouse favorite with the shrill manic ""original"" on which she failed to acknowledge the obvious model James Barries oft-filmed ""The Admirable Crichton"" -- or fellow Italian helmer Marco Ferreris ""Liza"" a suspiciously similar Deneuve-Mastroianni vehicle released just two years before. Wertmullers ""Swept Away..."" featured helmers recurrent stars Giancarlo Giannini and Mariangela Melato as a yachts macho deck hand and stereotypical ""rich bitch"" whose power roles are reversed when theyre lost at sea -- landing on a deserted island where his survival skills trump her haughtiness. Humiliated throttled and starved into subservience she eventually finds happiness as a well-tamed shrew. Current pic has the theoretical benefit of Madonnas various public/private images as satirical fodder -- ""rich"" ""bitch"" ""haughty"" and even sexual masochist being among those many shes toyed with or been accused of. Shes even sent herself up in Ritchies hands before via last years well-received internet short ""Star."" But this ""Swept Away"" has too little interest in class-divided social satire; ditto its rather humorless headline performance. Where Melato was a screeching cartoon of bratty privilege enormously wealthy Amber (Madonna) wife to biz tycoon Anthony (Bruce Greenwood) is just sullen clenched and joyless. Her criticisms fall mostly on hapless Giuseppe (Adriano Giannini) during a Greece-to-Italy private boating vacation with two other couples (Jeanne Tripplehorn and David Thornton Michael Beattie and Elizabeth Banks). Giuseppe loathes the ""boss lady"" of course. But hes being paid to grin and bear all arrogant abuse. When Amber demands her own expedition to local caves however her complaints cannot repair the subsequent faulty dinghy engine -- or attract rescuers or prevent a storm from washing them onto a white-sandy-beached isle. Tantrums soon fade into tummy growls; fed up Giuseppe demands he be called ""master"" and that she serve him if she wants to be fed. Ritchie has boasted that his screenplay shades the heroines transition from harpie to helpmate. But thats not how it plays While Wertmullers characters worked on their own terms as broad archetypes here were meant to feel ""real"" emotional development as Amber (in apparent reaction to Giuseppes threat then refusal to rape her) suddenly grows moist-eyed with amour. Several defiantly blissful love-in-paradise montages follow some set to the sensitive minimalist strains of Estonian composer Arvo Part. Having turned from dour half-hearted comedy on ship to unconvincing but picturesque romantic idyll the movie truly pratfalls in its final stretch prolonged far beyond storys prior incarnations. Having begged Giuseppe not to flag down rescuers Amber is delivered back to her husband. Yet shes still willing to leave wealth and status behind for true love; only the watchful spouses intervention keeps them apart. Frantic but too late hero rushes toward tearful heroines helicopter in a climactic slow-mo shot so corny it had even pushover preview viewers howling. Eschewing the hyperventilative style of his Brit gangster pics (""Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" ""Snatch"") Ritchie does an OK job here without ever really grasping materials possibilities. Characteristically his best sequence is the most vigorously physical one as leads chase slap and scuffle with one another on the beach early on. Most glaring least successful attempt to break things up is a musical fantasy (Giuseppe imagines a glam Amber lip-synching to Della Reese on ""Come On-A My House"" with full backing orchestra) too music-vid-like to seem like anything but a gratuitous bow to Madonna the Icon. Given a softer look than in some of her big-screen efforts (though mercifully sans ""Next Best Things"" extreme soft-focus) Madonna looks good here -- albeit aerobicized to sinewy excess. Acting-wise shes been worse yet the star charisma easily exuded in other formats still eludes her as a dramatic thesp. Adriano Giannini inheriting his dads role in a first English-language turn after just two prior Italo outings proves likeable and wildly photogenic. Tripplehorn -- briefly suggesting directions pic might well have explored further -- makes support casts only notable impression as an acid-tongued lush. D.p. Alex Barbers location shooting in Malta and Sardinia is attractive enough though lacking the full-on picture-postcard sumptuousness that helped make such past island fantasias as ""The Blue Lagoon"" into guilty pleasures. Despite beach setting nudity is fleeting. Other design and tech aspects are polished. Swept AwayProductionA Screen Gems release presented in association with Ska Films and CODI SpA.

Comments Swept Away Guy Ritchie wrote and directed this schizoid romantic comedy--a remake of Lina Wertmullers 1975 feature Swept Away . . . by an Unusual Destiny in the Blue Sea of August--as a vehicle for Madonna and both husband and wife seem to be in way over their heads. She plays a wealthy bitch on wheels whos dragged aboard a Greek yacht by her husband and some friends for a cruise to Italy; she amuses herself by torturing a hunky sailor (Adriano Giannini son of Giancarlo who played the role in the original) but when the two of them wind up stranded on a desert island he turns the tables on her and bends her to his will. The first half of the movie is full of broad but capable comedy but the original films sexual and class politics are clumsily handled and the mood turns serious with all the subtlety of a falling guillotine blade. 100 min.

But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

"Swept Away | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; swept-away_1359 ) Swept Away (United States/United Kingdom 2002) A movie review by James Berardinelli The word that best describes Guy Ritchies version of Swept Away is ""unfortunate."" The word that best describes Madonnas attempt to play Amber Leighton is ""unfortunate."" The word that best describes my decision to see this movie is ""unfortunate."" Make no mistake Swept Away is a bad movie. No amount of perfume sprayed on talk show audiences by Madonna and her husband can eliminate the stench of failure emanating from this motion picture. However it is not as has been suggested by a number of critics one of the worst films of all time. (Hyperbole Alert) In fact its not even one of the worst films of the year. Swept Away comes out favorably when compared to the likes of Rollerball and Serving Sara. It fares the worst when contrasted with the original Swept Away the controversial 1974 effort that earned writer/director Lina Wertmuller a Best Director Oscar Nomination. For the most part 2002s Swept Away is a relatively faithful remake of the original at least in terms of the broad strokes. The ending has been somewhat altered (and not for the better) but other than that Ritchie has retained Wertmullers plot often repeating it scene-for-scene. Swept Away tells the improbable love story of Amber (Madonna) the sourpuss wife of a rich man (Bruce Greenwood) and Guiseppe (Adriano Giannini) a deck worker on a private yacht. After spending days berating Guiseppe during a boat trip from Greece to Italy Amber ends up marooned on a deserted island with him. There the balance of power shifts. Since he is the only one who can provide food she must serve him in order to stay alive. He slaps her around a little. She dances for him. He beats his chest and exudes alpha-male pheromones. She sings sounding more like Britney Spears than Madonna (and doubtlessly frightening away the seagulls in the process). While all of this is going on Amber falls for Guiseppe (and he for her) and what began as an ordeal turns into an idyll. As told by Lina Wertmuller Swept Away is a fascinating and involving examination of gender issues and the shifting balance of a relationship a a drama with comedic overtones. As told by Ritchie the movie is an examination of how beautiful scenery can upstage actors. It is also openly hilarious. Unfortunately about 90% of the humor is unintentional. This Swept Away takes everything over-the-top from Ambers bitchiness (she calls Giuseppe ""Pee-pee"") to her eventual slavish devotion (she kisses his feet and gazes at him longingly). The characters transformation isnt remotely credible and since Ritchie is incapable of depicting it in meaningful scenes he falls back on the last resort of a bankrupt director the montage. Theres only one person who believes Madonna can truly act Madonna. Even Ritchie her husband appears to have his doubts. For that reason he has surrounded the pop icon with a cast that matches (and at times exceeds) her ineptitude. The best of the bad lot is Adriano Giannini (the son of Giancarlo Giannini who starred in the original Swept Away) whose chief assets are his looks and physicality not his acting chops. Bruce Greenwood who has never been memorable in anything not directed by Atom Egoyan shows amazing control of his facial muscles by never changing his expression. Meanwhile as wooden as Madonna is she is easily upstaged on the awfulness scale by supporting actress Jeanne Tripplehorn who plays one of the other passengers on the yacht. Its difficult to determine whether Swept Away should be viewed as a bigger shipwreck from a financial or a creative point-of-view. Considering Sonys marketing strategy its a foregone conclusion that the film will lose money. From a viewers standpoint the problem isnt that the cast director and script conspire to sink a motion picture that should have been electric but that Swept Away is boring. A better title for all concerned might be Swept Under the Rug.

Photo by Daniel Smith High and dry Madonna and Adriano Giannini in ""Swept Away"" based on Lina Wertmullers 1974 film and directed by Madonnas husband Guy Ritchie. Photo by Daniel Smith Swept Away goes way off course 1 / 1 Back to Gallery SWEPT AWAY Romantic comedy-drama. Starring Madonna and Adriano Giannini. Directed by Guy Ritchie. (R. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) If it were only just a little worse ""Swept Away"" could have been a so-bad- its-good classic on the order of ""Showgirls."" But even camp status eludes this tepid and misguided picture with Madonna as a nasty rich control freak who gets her comeuppance when she is washed up on a deserted island with an Italian fisherman. The movie is not just a weak effort but a big fat mistake. Guy Ritchie who wrote and directed it (based on Lina Wertmullers 1974 classic) has no conceptual intellectual or interpretive handle on the material. He knows hes making a movie for Madonna his wife but thats about all he knows. The social satire is muted even suffocated. The romance is unconvincing. The sex isnt sexy and the pace is off -- not just deadly slow but also unshaped and unstructured as in an amateur film. Scenes just lie there. The role of Amber (Madonna) the pampered wife of a pharmaceutical magnate is a kind of nightmare construction of Madonnas public image. Shes a horror. With two other couples Amber and her husband (Bruce Greenwood) go on a private cruise from Greece to Italy. On board Amber smokes constantly exercises incessantly and enjoys abusing the crew particularly Peppe (Adriano Giannini) whom she calls ""Pee Pee."" This might seem ideal casting for Madonna whos known to be impatient and exacting but in a comedy -- which I think this is -- its usually better to have someone whos not the type play the type. That way the actress has distance enough to understand what makes the type ridiculous. In ""Swept Away"" we know from the beginning that Amber is repellent but we can never be sure whether the actress or the filmmaker know it. They may simply think that shes an attractive person whos just behaving badly. This suspicion is confirmed early in the picture when the movie suggests that Peppe is physically attracted to Amber. This comes as a shock and the wrong kind of shock -- not ""Oh thats interesting"" but ""Yeah right."" Why should he be? As played by Madonna Amber is monochromatic in her viciousness without a glimmer of redeeming color. Perhaps if she were absolutely gorgeous the viciousness itself would have some allure but at this stage of her career Madonna looks like a normal aerobicized middle-aged matron only meaner. When Amber and Peppe are washed up alone on a deserted island their roles are reversed. She becomes dependent on him for food and shelter and he lords it over her making her wait on him and call him ""master."" In the Wertmuller film the situation provided an opportunity for some leftist social commentary as well as some daring scenes of sexual humiliation. The new ""Swept Away"" doesnt have any interest in the former and lacks the guts to try the latter. The movie concentrates instead on the romance and theres not much to it. Theyre stuck on a deserted island. What else are they going to do? Actually that might explain Madonnas interest in the role -- its the one context in which she can be believable as a romantic lead The guy cant get off the island. Just to show that he still has a pulse that he was indeed the fellow who made ""Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" Ritchie tries to enliven the island idyll with a couple of overproduced fantasy sequences but they strike the eye as desperate and even embarrassing. In one Madonna lip-synchs and dances in front of an old-time big band. The gimmick casting of Adriano Giannini -- his father Giancarlo played the same role in the Wertmuller film -- works to the extent that anything can be said to work in ""Swept Away."" But the star here is Madonna and Madonna just isnt an actress. She lacks the innocence of spirit the willingness to surrender that actors have. Madonna has something else -- a quality in her personality thats relentlessly direct willing to face reality in all its bleakness. But its the wrong quality in a movie about a woman who gets swept away. This movie contains strong language and brief nudity.

Story Tools RELATED  Madonna My priority is family  EW.COM All about Madonna  CNN.com  Reviews archive  EW.COM  Movie reviews (CNN) -- Undoubtedly Guy Ritchies version of Lina Wertmullers 1974 Italian-language classic ""Swept Away"" will be compared ad nauseam to the original by high-minded pundits from coast to coast -- many of whom probably never saw the original. But whats the point? Both Ritchie and his wife Madonna -- the star of the film -- have stated again and again that remaking the original with all its class and political conflict and heavy violence and sex was not their intention. Thank goodness for that because the new ""Swept Away"" has little in common with the previous film. In fact the finished project is more akin to a mixture of Goldie Hawns 1987 ""Overboard"" and Shakespeares ""Taming of the Shrew."" Regarding the latter Im not talking about the 1967 Burton-Taylor movie version but a small-town high school theatrical production. Sneer and loathing Madonna plays Amber a spoiled rich rhymes-with-witch whos arrogant beyond the point of all reason. Her barely repressed rage hangs over her like a cheap perfume. In the screenplay by Ritchie the character is hopelessly one-dimensional and has a one-note emotional range. Of course Madonna bangs away at that one note like a demented drummer. This film may not stop the debate raging over whether Mrs. Ritchie can or cannot act but the number of people trying to defend her acting abilities is dwindling to a die-hard few. Madonna ends up on a deserted island with a sailor played by Adriano Giannini. The story begins with Amber and her wimpy milquetoast -- but very wealthy -- husband Tony (Bruce Greenwood) boarding a yacht in the Mediterranean with a group of equally rich and equally bored friends. Amber takes an immediate loathing toward one of the crew a fisherman named Giuseppe played by Adriano Giannini. She proceeds to snap her fingers her mouth and any other handy weapon in his direction until hes on the verge of exploding. At one point the rest of the guests have taken a day trip in one of the yachts small boats. Long after their departure Amber decides to join them and despite Giuseppes warning about impending bad weather they set out in another small boat. Surprise surprise A storm occurs and theyre washed up onto a deserted island. Now the tables are turned. Giuseppe the fisherman is the one with the power. Amber is suddenly dependent upon him for food water shelter and survival itself. Hes ready for revenge and wastes no time in seizing the opportunity to lord it over the spoiled rich American. He forces her to call him master and wash his clothes by pounding them on rocks. (Madonna flaying Guiseppes pants on a rock is almost worth the price of admission.) In return he catches fish and provides food and shelter. Better than Shanghai Surprise Madonna is a wealthy wife in ""Swept Away."" Now Amber goes through a transformation from an insufferable self-involved monster to a warm caring woman who is a cross between June Cleaver and Linda Lovelace. Of course they fall in love and the question now becomes what will happen when they return to civilization? Will her transformation last or will she revert to type? Does anyone actually care? ""Swept Away"" isnt all terrible -- and its not as awful as some of Madonnas more glaring atrocities such as ""Shanghai Surprise"" (1986) and ""The Next Best Thing"" (2000). Ritchies direction is clever precise inventive and quite effective. Giannini whose father Giancarlo played the same role in the original film is excellent. His proud fisherman who stands his ground and stands for his principles is both strong and endearing. The locations are stunning and the cinematographer Alex Barber takes full advantage of the lush scenery. However the one musical number -- there had to be one -- comes out of nowhere and returns quickly to the same place. Madonnas die-hard fans will be pleased. This first major attempt at collaborating with her writer-director husband is neither a rousing success nor a blinding embarrassment. Still it just sits there like a side dish no one ordered. ""Swept Away"" opens in limited release Friday and will go wide in the coming weeks. Its rated R.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr B- Swept Away Genre Comedy; Starring Adriano Giannini Madonna Elizabeth Banks Bruce Greenwood Jeanne Tripplehorn; Director Guy Ritchie; Author Guy Ritchie; Release Date Wide 10/11/2002; Runtime (in minutes) 93; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Screen Gems Inc. Posted October 9 2002 -- 1200 AM EDT Drawn lacquered and just about as tanned as Goldmember Madonna in Swept Away appears blowsy and middle-aged and the hard character of experience does something for her. It allows her to leave vanity aside. (Either that or her vanity now resides in her biceps which are sinewy enough to strangle a panther.) Sound the trumpets For the first time since ""Desperately Seeking Susan"" Madonna doesnt suck as an actress. In a movie career that is by now nearly as benighted as that of Linda Blair or Maria Montez she comes through with a performance in which her line readings dont clatter like broken plates and she looks at least half as relaxed as she does on stage. It helps that shes playing a spoiled aristocratic pain - a rich bitch who needs to be taken down about nine notches. In her husband Guy Ritchies remake of the 1974 Lina Wertmuller screwball desert-island sex war Amber (Madonna) a wealthy pharmaceutical heiress ends up cast away with Giuseppe (Adriano Giannini) the hunky Italian first mate shed abused and ridiculed like the lowliest of slaves. Since their survival depends on his handyman skills he turns Amber into his slave forcing her to call him ""master"" and dominating her sexually. And wouldnt you know...she likes it Set in the aquamarine Mediterranean ""Swept Away"" may be a fake art film but Ritchie cuts down on the repetitive class-war shrillness of the original. Hes made a movie that never pretends to be more than a guilty pleasure of soft-core kitsch and Madonna and Giannini (son of Giancarlo costar of the original) achieve a lively Samp;M chemistry. Wertmullers film like it or not was one of the seminal pop fantasies of erotic incorrectness. In our own era however one of postfeminist consumer princesses and Maxim-ized alpha males ""Swept Away"" now looks about as subversive as ""Last Tango in the Blue Lagoon.""
