Mars Needs Moms is a textbook example a forgettable roto-animated romp for undemanding pre-teens complete with 3D action a C-list voice cast and a good wholesome message about respecting your mother provided shes not an evil alien overlord.Perennial nearly-man Seth Scott Evil Green voices Milo the petulant pre-teen who embarks on an impromptu interplanetary voyage when his long-suffering mother (Joan Cusack) is kidnapped by parentally inexperienced Martians to train their army of soulless nanny-bots. The Polar Express-style CG-meets-live-action visuals are creepy and flat the characters are largely nonexistent and the story takes so many short cuts that it becomes meaningless but if all youre looking for is a way to keep the kids quiet for 90 minutes this should just about suffice.

Photo Credit AP Photo advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A young boy travels to Mars to rescue his abducted mother. BOTTOM LINE Substandard kiddie fare with by-the-numbers computer animation. CAST Seth Green Joan Cusack Dan Fogler WHEN/WHERE Find local theaters where ""Mars Needs Moms"" is playing LENGTH 122 In the 3-D motion-capture movie ""Mars Needs Moms"" Seth Green plays a young boy named Milo. Actually Green (the ""Austin Powers"" films) only acted out the movements. An 11-year-old named Seth Dusky provided the voice. Its complicated. More complicated in fact than necessary. ""Mars Needs Moms"" is the latest film to use motion capture in which actors wearing bodysuits and facial sensors generate data for computer animation. Its a far cry from the days when animators would grin into a mirror while sketching out a smile but the results generally dont look any more ""alive"" than say the jaunty Mickey Mouse who first appeared in 1928. Whats more computers still cant generate inspiration something ""Mars Needs Moms"" sorely lacks. advertisement | advertise on newsday Based on a childrens book by cartoonist Berkeley Breathed the film begins with a disobedient Milo discovering that his unnamed mom (Joan Cusack) is being abducted by aliens. After boarding the spaceship himself Milo discovers the nanny-bots of Mars need reprogramming -- and his moms brain will provide the reboot. Milo eventually meets the Earthling Gribble (Dan Fogler) an overweight man-boy in the Rogen/Belushi mold and Ki (Elisabeth Harnois) a ditsy Martian who learned her English from 1960s television (""crazy beautiful""). Together they form a plan to rescue Mom. Oddly an interspecies romance blooms as well. The characters look a little like their actors but move with the fake fluidity that remains a hallmark of much computer animation. Overall the film looks neither fully real nor fully imagined which could be forgiven if ""Mars Needs Moms"" had something more to offer besides its nifty technology.

"Mars Needs Moms review Missing mother inspires minors mission |       NJ.com comments Mars Needs Moms review Missing mother inspires minors mission Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on March 11 2011 at 752 AM View/Post Comments AP Photo/Walt DisneyKi voiced by Elisabeth Harnois is shown in a scene from ""Mars Needs Moms."" Take me to your mother. In the new cartoon ""Mars Needs Moms"" folks from that angry red planet come down to our big blue marble with one mission Kidnap a human maternal unit to help raise their offspring. Too bad for them they also pick up a stowaway -- her angry and extremely resourceful young son. ""Mars Needs Moms"" is directed by Simon Wells who provides at least an interesting bit of trivia to the proceedings -- hes the great-grandson of H.G. Wells who sent us an even angrier group of Martians in ""The War of the Worlds."" Too bad the director doesnt have his ancestors original wayback machine so he could go back in time and fix up this film. Movie Review Mars Needs Moms (PG) Disney (88 min.) Directed by Simon Wells. With the voices of Seth Green Joan Cusack Dan Fogler. Now playing in New Jersey Rating note The film contains mildly gross humor. Stephen Whittys Review TWO STARS For example the central idea -- that the Martians are grabbing bossy mothers so they can re-program their nanny-bots with new discipline chips -- isnt very appealing. Couldnt they be kidnapping really sweet and patient parents to help humanize their robots? And once we get to Mars the social structure there is a little odd with all the males exiled to a giant garbage heap -- because theyd rather dance all day than work -- while the humorless females run things led by a lemon-sucking crone who looks like Mr. Spocks great-great-aunt. So okay men are completely irresponsible slobs which is why women need to be unceasing nags. Check. Great message for the kids. It would be easier to ignore this if the animation were better. But the Martian women all look like that sexy robot who sells Swedish vodka. And the films motion-capture artwork feels like a bad compromise between live-action and animation with none of the realism of the first and little of the fantasy of the second. If you can get past all that -- and it takes a bit of work -- there is some surprisingly real emotion here much of it centering on the loss of a parent and the guilt of a child (a trope Disney has been using brilliantly for decades to pull tears). There is also some marvelous acting -- although not so much by Seth Green as our young hero Milo. The real heavy vocal lifting goes to the always delightful Joan Cusack as the captured Mom and the hard-working Dan Fogler as Gribble another stranded human Milo encounters. You can even occasionally discern Cusacks sweetly goofy expressions beneath the animation and Foglers neo-Belushi mugging. If youre a sci-fi fan you can also pass the time by picking out the influences behind some of the gags from ""Mars Needs Women"" for the title to ""Invaders From Mars"" for a nefarious machine and ""Star Wars"" for a garbage-chute escape. But thats not enough. Mars may need moms but hey first things first -- earthlings need better movies.

STEPHEN COLE The Globe and Mail Published Friday Mar. 11 2011 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 241PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English As maternal chores go the new 3-D animated comedy Mars Needs Moms beats ransacking the closet for lost hockey pads at 6 in the morning. Or riding herd on math homework. Still moviegoing moms could have hoped for more screen time from a family movie that pretends to be about them. But the disappointing news (for moms anyway) is that while Mars might need mothers Mars Needs Moms is most often without a sympathetic female caregiver in sight. Movies Mars Needs Moms The official trailer The message here clearly is that moms and family fun like broccoli and popcorn just dont mix. The latest from Disney begins with nine-year-old Milo arguing with his mother about finishing his vegetables. Mom loses patience; Milo his temper. ""I wish my mother wasnt around"" the boy hisses. Even as extraterrestrials cram Mom into a spaceship destined for the fourth planet from the sun. There shell spend most of the movie hidden perhaps trying to scrub the crimson stain out of the Red Planet. Milo chases after Mom nabbing a ride on the spaceship. Eventually the little guy lands on Mars chilling with Jar-Jar Binks types in a spreading trash heap before befriending a chubby middle-aged Earthling. Gribble came to Mars 25 years ago in search of his mom but stayed for the cable. (The planet is just getting eighties Earth TV and movie series. And Gribble has a serious Top Gun jones.) Milo and Gribble soon go up against goose-stepping clone warriors and inevitably escape by taking advantage of the elaborate Martian tunnel system in the process enjoying an endless variety of thrill rides. No homework. No broccoli. No gravity. Milo is having the adventure of his life. And moms heres another kick in the skirt When Milo bumps into someone who might know where his mother is he goes into a pantomime explaining what it is moms do He pretends to vacuum. Oh it gets worse. Mars needs moms because Martians are hatched. Spring alive like popped kernels of corn. They have no discipline. Every few decades executive headhunters land on Earth looking for a frowning housewife with a drill instructors talent for barking orders. The mother is then downloaded into fussing nannybots. Mars itself is run by mean Martian Amazons. Happy Womens Week to moms everywhere from Disney Even though Mars Needs Moms isnt female-friendly mothers looking for quality time with 6- to 12-year-old boys could do worse than book group passage there soon. The jokes and 3-D jack-in-the-box surprises are crudely inventive. Loud and proud the way boys like them. And the films Star Wars fetish - cute computer pets retro-futurist architecture - will surely stir the soul of Lucas Youth. Mars Needs Moms also takes full advantage of the Red Planets crazy-thin atmosphere. Little boys watching Milo can imagine themselves springing about as if theyre in an NBA slam-dunk competition. A warning though The animation here is secured by performance-capture technique where actors movements are digitally recorded. (The same method was used in Polar Express.) We can see the performers Seth Green (Milo) and Joan Cusack (his mom) trapped like Madame Tussaud waxworks inside their characters. Its amazing to see but potentially unsettling. Green is now 37. And it may be more than some mothers can take imagining themselves cleaning up after their ""little boy"" when hes crowding 40.

Behind him is Gribble a fellow Earthling. Credit ImageMovers Digital/Walt Disney Pictures It seems that its time to admit that dressing actors in LED-studded catsuits asking them to give performances on sterile white sets and handing the results to a team of computer animators is not a way to make a good movie. It didnt work for ""The Polar Express"" ""Beowulf"" or ""A Christmas Carol"" and it doesnt work for ""Mars Needs Moms"" the latest product of Robert Zemeckiss obsession with motion-capture animation.Mr. Zemeckis is a producer of ""Mars Needs Moms"" which was directed by Simon Wells (""The Prince of Egypt""). Mr. Wells and his animators have come up with some impressive Martian landscapes both on and beneath the surface but as usual fluid motion and depth of field are trumped by waxy inexpressive faces. Why hire Joan Cusack to play the mom if youre just going to make her look like a mummy?The story based on a childrens book by the cartoonist Berkeley Breathed involves a race of stern Martian women who subjugate their men and kidnap Earth mothers because of their superior child-rearing skills. It could be read as antifeminist if you had a term paper to write; parents may be more disturbed by the implication that an obedient child is more likely to have his mom taken by Martians.

Low around 70F. Winds N at 5 to 10 mph. Updated July 30 2016  702 am Full Forecast News Sports Business Go Life Buy/Sell Movies Close Ki (voiced by Elisabeth Harnois) in ""Mars Needs Moms"" (Walt Disney Studios) Mars Disney shows dark side in Mars Needs Moms BY JODY MITORI  jmitoripost-dispatch.com  314-340-8240 Mar 11 2011 (...) Ki (voiced by Elisabeth Harnois) in ""Mars Needs Moms"" (Walt Disney Studios) Mothers have a tough time in Disneys animated movies. Hunters shot Bambis a barracuda ate Nemos and a leopard killed Tarzans. In ""Mars Needs Moms"" the studios latest release the mother is abducted by aliens.Nine-year-old Earthling Milo (Seth Green) is tired of his mother (the wonderfully maternal Joan Cusack) nagging him to take out the trash and eat his broccoli. In a fit of anger he tells his mom that his life would be better off without her.Meanwhile the leader of the Red Planet the Supervisor (Mindy Sterling) barks at her crew to find a human mom to train the nannybots that care for their babies. The Martians target Milos mother and kidnap her in the middle of the night. Just before Milos mom is whisked away he manages to get on board. When he gets to Mars he meets Gribble (Dan Fogler sounding a lot like Jack Black) a 30-something human who has been stuck on the planet since the 80s.Through Gribble Milo learns that Martians are terrible at mothering. They admire the discipline that human mothers teach so they find a way to extract this ability from the moms brains and share it with the nannybots.Milo tries desperately to rescue his mother with the help of Gribble and rebellious Martian Ki (Elisabeth Harnois). They fight against the Supervisor (who looks like E.T. with a wig) and the other female aliens who are her followers. ""Mars Needs Moms"" is dark for a Disney movie. Director Simon Wells tries for silly laughs mostly with a few potty jokes and Kis enthusiastic use of English slang but the threat to the mother Milos guilt over his last words to her and Gribbles sad back story cast a serious pall over the picture. The film also makes a not-so-subtle commentary on gender roles with militant female Martians ruling the planet while the males live in the dump banished there because they like to play and dance too much.The 3-D animation doesnt add much warmth. Using a similar motion-capture process that was employed in ""The Polar Express"" and ""A Christmas Carol"" the film is filled with great detail -- the strands of Milos moms hair the rocky surface of Mars -- but the human characters have a glassy-eyed mannequinlike quality. The story is based on a book by Berkeley Breathed the creator of the ""Bloom County"" and ""Opus"" comic strips. If Breatheds style could have been applied to the animation this offbeat story would have a better chance at success. Instead were left with a kids movie that leaves audiences cold.Two stars (out of four)  What ""Mars Needs Moms""  Rating PG  Run time 128  Content Sci-fi action and peril Videos Watch a trailer for Mars Needs Moms Mar 9 2011 (...)

The best thing about the charm-free off-putting Disney-sponsored toon ""Mars Needs Moms"" is the title which cartoonist Berkeley Breathed (""Bloom County"") evidently borrowed from the legendarily inept 1967 sci-fi flick ""Mars Needs Women"" for his own 2007 childrens book. Breathed provides the Spielbergian conceit -- a suburban kid tries to rescue his kidnapped mom after stowing away on a spaceship. This overblown adaptation (available in 3-D and for those with money to burn IMAX) adds a misogynistic subtext that in no way can be dealt with in a cartoon that runs barely over an hour before you get to the lengthy end credits. That isnt even the biggest problem The obnoxious youngster is voiced by the supremely annoying Seth Green. And the voice of the middle-aged Earthling who explains the mysteries of Mars to him (and to us) is provided by perhaps the only actor working in Hollywood today who is even less fun to listen to Dan Fogler. And then theres the less-than-beguiling dead-eye motion-capture animation -- provided by actors hooked up to computer sensors -- that has worked better in live-action films like ""Avatar"" than in toons. Suffice it to say that Disney long ago pulled the plug on ImageMovers the studio responsible for ""Mars Needs Moms"" and ""A Christmas Carol."" Produced by ""Christmas Carol"" director Robert Zemeckis with direction credited to Simon Wells (H.G.s great-grandson who helmed the ill-fated live-action 2002 remake of ""The Time Machine"") the movie has some impressive imagery referencing ""Star Wars"" and (like Zemeckis notorious ""The Polar Express"") the Nazi documentary ""Triumph of the Will."" But aside from a relatively brief appearance by Joan Cusacks avatar as the kidnapped mother there are no involving characters or situations. And even adults may be confused by the back story about Mars matriarchal society -- presided over by an extraterrestrial version of Linda Hunt -- which casts all newborn males into underground dungeons while the girls are raised by robots. Cusacks character is scheduled to be um lobotomized to program those robots in ""Mars Needs Moms."" And you thought you had a lot of explaining to do for the little ones at the end of ""Rango.""

Nine-year-old Milo finds out just how much he needs his mom when shes nabbed by Martians who plan to steal her mom-ness for their own young. A fun smart flick about the strength of family. Starring Seth Green Joan Cusack Elisabeth Harnois Dan Fogler Mindy Sterling Julene Renee Ryan Ochoa Jacquie Barnbrook Matthew Wolf Raymond Ochoa Director Simon Wells Running time 128 Release Opened Mar 11 2011  Editorial Review Invasion of the mom snatchersBy Sean OConnellFriday March 11 2011Where on Earth would you be without your mom? Well if you are Milo the pint-size but courageous hero of Simon Wellss inventive and vigorous new ""Mars Needs Moms"" you might not be on Earth at all. Unlike those greedy mommy-snatching Martians slithering through this interplanetary adventure ""Mars Needs Moms"" doesnt need much to help it succeed. A few snips to its midsection might reduce some of the chaotic energy that clogs a busy second act. And the motion-capture animation could use a polish. But ""Mars"" works well and precious few improvements are necessary. Parents however will need tissues. Lots of tissues. Because Wells - great-grandson of science-fiction pioneer H.G. Wells - and his creative team travel nearly 250 million miles through outer space to unearth valuable life lessons about parenting and the strength of family. And motion-captured tears shed by a motion-captured mom still achieve the desired emotional response so long as the sentiment underlying the animated story is played properly. The digital technique which uses microscopic cameras and strategically placed sensors to digitally capture an actors performance has come a long way since 2004s ""The Polar Express."" It still cant replicate the photo-realism achieved by contemporary animated films such as ""Rango"" or Pixars assorted masterpieces. But that doesnt take away from how much ""Mars"" touches our hearts. Not that Wells has made an ooey-gooey love fest. The fast-moving ""Mars"" starts with an argument between Milo (Seth Green) and his loving but firm mother (Joan Cusack). Sent to bed before he can watch his favorite zombie horror movie on pay per view Milo blurts out how much better his life would be without his mom. Hes about to find out how wrong he is. Listening in on their conversation - from many miles away - is the Supervisor (Mindy Sterling) a Martian leader scouring our planet for a prize-winning mom. Every 25 years Mars endures a baby boom producing infantile hatchlings who need to be taught discipline. Martian scientists have devised cold robotic nanny-bots but must download an earthling mothers memories before the parenting program can successfully reboot. Milo witnesses his moms abduction and manages to stowaway in the alien craft before it leaves our planet. Now he has until sunrise to retrieve his mom or hell lose her forever. Once Wells has established his out-of-this-world premise ""Mars"" settles into a more traditional down-to-earth routine. Milo encounters an ally on the red planet named Gribble (Dan Fogler) an abandoned astronaut held over from Ronald Reagans top-secret anti-Communism space initiative who twitches like a Red Bull addict and spouts 80s catchphrases. In truth hes a requisite sidekick character Disney animators regularly trot out for comic relief. Thankfully he ranks low on the annoyance scale falling somewhere between Mulans Mushu the dragon and Aladdins magic genie. Sequestered in a cluttered bunker (lifted directly from ""The Matrix"") Gribble plugs into the Martian infrastructure and helps Milo maneuver around the alien planet so he can find his mom. Its on these dangerous missions that Wells exposes his harsh uninviting Martian environments and turns them into adventurous playgrounds. Savvy moms and dads will recognize reference points to sci-fi classics. The Supervisor stomps down cavernous hallways that call to mind Darth Vaders Death Star lair. Gribbles home base a garbage dump looks eerily similar to Wall-Es trash-strewn planet. And while Wellss ice-blue color scheme borrows from both ""Tron"" films and a litany of ""Star Trek"" episodes a majestic musical score by the great composer John Powell somehow makes everything old feel fresh and wondrous again. As does the main character. When the spaceship carrying Milos mom to a distant planet breaches our stratosphere Milo temporarily forgets the dire nature of his predicament and declares ""This is so cool."" Im pretty sure most of the kids as well as the young at heart sitting in the audience will agree.Contains sci-fi action and peril.

Photo Walt Disney Studios Associated Press Mars Needs Moms review Animation with a twist 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Mars Needs Moms Animated fantasy. Starring the voices of Seth Green Dan Fogler and Joan Cusack. Directed by Simon Wells. (PG-13. 88 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Sometimes charming and sometimes labored ""Mars Needs Moms"" tells the story of a kid who learns to appreciate his mother only after she is abducted by space aliens. In the movies first five minutes young Milo complains about the smallest of chores whines about having to eat broccoli lies to his mother hurts her feelings and expresses excessive enthusiasm for any entertainment involving zombies. The kid is a creep a nuisance and a burden and yet between the lines the movie suggests that Milo is really just a fine little fellow albeit with the minor faults and healthy obstreperousness of a boy his age. Talk about setting the bar too low especially in a movie that kids will be watching. ""Mars Needs Moms"" floats about 45 minutes worth of story in an 88-minute ocean. The boy - voiced by actor Seth Green who sounds remarkably like a real kid - stows away to rescue his mother (Joan Cusack) and the rest of the film details his efforts. Obviously he cant succeed right away or else the movie would never make feature length. But whats good about the film is that it offers more than a single stretched-out story line. Martian civilization is detailed as a very particular police state in which the female Martians rule the planet and make up the entire military. Still these ladies need to import mothers from Earth. There are odd undercurrents here that seem not subtle so much as unconscious. Is this motion-capture animation suggesting that women in power are defeminized or that women with small children shouldnt work? And what are we to make of the Martian women speaking a dialect that sounds Asian while the lowly tribespeople who live out on the fringes have a vaguely African cast? Related Stories Mars Needs Moms In any case this is all a learning experience for Milo who soon realizes how much his mother means to him. After all she loves him she bandages his cuts she hugs him and ""she takes me to Disneyland."" Hold it what was that last one? Three guesses what company made this movie. The faces of the characters have the slightly stunned look common to motion-capture and to Walter Keane paintings but the details are sharply defined and there was a genuine effort to make the 3-D count for something. The films rich visuals buy it some goodwill especially when seeing it as I saw it on an Imax screen. But however you see it the very best thing about ""Mars Needs Moms"" is the climactic scene which is unexpected fairly moving and flirts with areas and emotions one doesnt expect to see in a childrens film. Its not quite enough to make ""Mars Needs Moms"" worth seeing but its enough to earn it a reasonable morsel of respect. -- Advisory There are some moments that may disturb very small children.

The movie is hampered by uninteresting characters a predictable story and 3-D technology which darkens even the brightest colors and detracts from the vibrancy of the tale. ImageMovers Digital/Disney Enterprises On a mission to save Mom Gribble left and Milo travel to Mars to save Milos mother who was abducted to teach robots how to discipline kids. EnlargeClose ImageMovers Digital/Disney Enterprises On a mission to save Mom Gribble left and Milo travel to Mars to save Milos mother who was abducted to teach robots how to discipline kids. Directed by Simon Wells it employs a performance-capture technique that has the familiar stamp of producer Robert Zemeckis. His last three features (Disneys A Christmas Carol Beowulf and The Polar Express) have used the format. Performance capture entails actors executing their moves in special suits that are linked to a 3-D model in the computer. While offering a few laughs its commentary on motherhood seems simplistic. Essentially moms who spend their days vacuuming and picking up after children are worthy of beatification. The story based on a book by Berkeley Breathed centers on rambunctious 9-year-old Milo (Seth Green does the performance and Seth Robert Dusky 11 provides the voice). His capable mom (Joan Cusack) is whisked away in her sleep by Martians and Milo stows away on the spaceship determined to rescue her. Once he lands on Mars he meets a techno-geek named Gribble (Dan Fogler) and they share some perilous adventures. On Mars were told little girls are raised by nanny-robots presided over by a malicious Supervisor (Mindy Sterling). Supervisor and her assistant Ki (Elisabeth Harnois) had observed Earth moms and zeroed in on Milos mother as just the sort of disciplinarian needed to train nanny-bots. Once Milo learns of the Supervisors dastardly plan to tap into his moms brain and then dispose of her he knows he must save her -- and fast. About the movie Mars Needs Moms  (out of four)Stars Joan Cusack Dan Fogler Elisabeth Harnois Mindy Sterling Kevin CahoonDirector Simon WellsDistributor Walt Disney PicturesRating PG for sci-fi action and perilRunning time 1 hour 28 minutesOpens Friday nationwide Kis rebellious character is the films most endearing. She has the funniest lines having learned hippie-style English from watching 60s TV. Shes fascinated by color and surreptitiously paints graffiti on Mars drab gray institutional walls. Maybe shes Banksy. But the movie has more charm when its earthbound. Cusack and Greens mother-son repartee has sharp comic timing. Once the story veers off to space it goes downhill. And the notion that kids could lose their competent caring moms to space aliens sends children a strange message indeed. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

But families may be pleasantly surprised to find this an often thrilling and imaginative ride for younger kids with a big helping of heart for parents.Adapted loosely from a picture book by Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Berkeley Breathed its the story of Milo (voiced by Seth Green). Hes so annoyed with his mother (Joan Cusack) reminding him to take out the trash clean his room and eat his broccoli that he tells her he wishes he didnt have a mom.Just as hes about to apologize the Martians whisk her away. It seems that after searching the world for a mom for their hatchlings they have picked his. Even worse their plan is to extract her mothering talents transfer them to a robot crew of nannybots and vaporize her.While the arc of the story may seem obvious -- boy rescues and learns to appreciate his mom -- director Simon Wells keeps viewers glued with an exhilarating series of roller coaster-like escapades under the planet surface. Milo hurtles down twisty chutes teeters precariously on high narrow ledges of towering buildings and risks daring leaps over lava flows and dark abysses.The script co-written by Simon and Wendy Wells bobbles a bit. Theres a silly slew of plot extenders running the gamut from a Planet of the Apes-type revelation that Martians were not always raised by nannybots to an unlikely romance between a grubby human named Gribble (Dan Fogler) and a spirited Martian named Ki (Elisabeth Harnois).The story gets back to its emotional point when Milo discovers Gribbles secret which makes Milo more determined to succeed.Wells shows a deft hand with the motion-capture techniques on 3-D IMAX that Robert Zemeckis the films producer used with such poetic panache on The Polar Express and A Christmas Carol. The method in which actors movements are recorded and then translated to animation gives these appealing performers a chance to make their gestures as well as their voices count.And count they do particularly when Milo and his mom are fleeing the Martians and Milos space helmet shatters in a fall. As he gasps for breath his mother tenderly takes off her helmet puts it on his head and locks it so he cant give it back. She doesnt say a word and she doesnt need to. Its a transcendent moment that lifts this slight confection a cut above.B Starring the voice talents of Seth Green Joan Cusack Dan Fogler and Elisabeth Harnois. Directed by Simon Wells.

By Joe Morgenstern Updated March 11 2011 1201 a.m. ET Soon after the fevered opening of this latest ""Jane Eyre"" the far-off figure of the heroine unmoored on the moors stands at a crossroads that is hardly more than a crosspaths--four corners faintly traced in one of the films many understated yet transfixing vistas. Almost everything about Cary Fukunagas version of the Charlotte Bronte romance is understated yet transfixing mainly--although far from exclusively--because of Mia Wasikowskas presence in the title role. She embodies Janes most endearing qualities--courage passion devotion unadorned beauty--but not for a moment the moist poignance that many of the umpteen previous versions have inflicted on her. (Eighteen feature films to be exact and nine TV versions.) This Jane meets the world and everyone in it with a rock-solid sense of herself that can only be shaken by love. Ms. Wasikowska works with economical purity within the novels 19th-century English setting. Janes personal power seems entirely her own rather than some anachronistic notion of self-empowerment. Thats particularly stirring in a crucial moment of self-assertion--""Am I a machine without feelings?"" she begins--with Michael Fassbenders forbiddingly handsome Rochester. And its all the more impressive in light of the young Australian stars charmingly modern portrayal of an American teenage daughter in ""The Kids Are All Right."" ENLARGE Mia Wasikowska as the title character in Jane Eyre. Focus Features Speakeasy Does Jane Eyre Do Justice to the Book? But then the work of Mr. Fukunaga--who directed from a strong adaptation by Moira Buffini--is impressive too. He made his directorial debut two years ago with ""Sin Nombre"" a dramatically commanding and visually expansive account in Spanish of impoverished immigrants riding atop freight trains as they lumber through Mexico toward the U.S. border. That was a singular choice for the California-born son of a Swedish-American mother and a Japanese-American father though maybe not such a strange one given his rich family heritage. Choosing a remake of the oft-made Bronte classic did seem odd on the face of it and more than a little worrisome for those of us who cherished ""Sin Nombre"" and wished him only the best. As it turns out there was no need to worry. With these two productions each distinct from the other though connected by impeccable craftsmanship Mr. Fukunaga has arrived as a self-effacing master of his medium. He and Ms. Buffini have heightened the drama of their source material in two ways both successful. Theyve rearranged the narrative by starting with Janes heartsick flight from Thornfield Hall by spending useful time on her usually scanted encounter with St. John Rivers (Jamie Bell) and his family and by playing as powerful flashbacks her harsh childhood as an orphan as well as her time as a governess at Thornfield. The film also has somber fun with Thornfield as a haunted house of alarming sounds and squeaking timbers. The heart of the story remains Janes anguished love for Rochester and that heart beats strongly even though this ""Jane Eyre"" moves at a pace some may find slow I found it perfectly measured. Mr. Fassbenders lord of the cursed manor is worthy of his governesss love even though hes no match for the one played by Timothy Dalton when it comes to bottomless despair or towering rage and though he cant or wisely wont touch the doomy self-regard that Orson Welles brought to the role. Instead of a black hole taking energy in hes a pulsar pumping it out in the form of pain relieved at least for a while by wry humor and an openness to Janes beauty. Judi Dench as Rochesters housekeeper Mrs. Fairfax dispenses gentle humor unburdened by pain though enriched by maturity and kindness. Will Hughes-Jones designed the production. Michael OConnor did the marvelous costumes. When I wrote about ""Sin Nombre"" which was shot with graphic grandeur by the Brazilian cinematographer Adriano Goldman I called the use of 35mm film cameras instead of digital equipment a crucial aesthetic choice. Thats equally true of ""Jane Eyre"" which was shot by Mr. Goldman with equal virtuosity though in a very different visual style. His technique is painterly in its evocation of 19th century English artists. Beyond that its distinguished by an abundance of tonal variety interiors that seem to take on the smell of weathered furniture; softly modeled closeups that cast Jane as a country madonna; candlelit scenes that recall the magical warmth of ""Barry Lyndon."" To prove that I didnt embrace ""Jane Eyre"" uncritically Ill note that pulses were taken in the 19th century by checking the wrist not the carotid artery as shown here and Ill register an objection to the use of surround sound to create squeaking timbers at the back of the theater. This lovely film surrounds us without it. Mars Needs Moms Watch a clip from the animated sci-fi action film Mars Needs Moms. A 3-D animated feature from Disney ""Mars Needs Moms"" looks impressive up to a point. Most of the action takes place beneath the surface of Mars where hatchling kiddies are raised by nannybots in an elaborately technological setting that owes much of its retro esthetic to Terry Gilliam. But the film suffers from chronic light loss thats at least as depressing as the dumb story. Part of that loss is imposed by the storys terms--an earth mother or rather an Earth mother is kidnapped by a Martian civilization that keeps her underground to tap her parenting skills (shes voiced by Joan Cusack); and a deadline requires her son Milo (Seth Green) to rescue her before the Martian sunrise--in other words no hope of blue skies on the red planet. Even more light is lost to the 3-D glasses leading one to wonder during the movies frequent down times what the producers were thinking. ENLARGE Two of the maternally deficient aliens of Mars Needs Moms. ImageMovers ""Mars Needs Moms"" instills mom appreciation in Milo and is meant to do the same for all the Milos and Mileys in the audience. By the end the 9-year-old hero comes to see maternal authority as loving wisdom and eating broccoli or taking out the garbage as privileges instead of chores. But theres nothing to be said in favor of sitting through garbage and this movie is awash in the stuff both figuratively and literally One of its main locales is a vast garbage dump. The pace is frantic--""Inspector Gadget"" lives--and the secondary characters are nattering nuisances an Earth nerd Gribble (Dan Fogler) who may have been modeled on John Belushis screwball pilot in ""1941"" and a Martian girl Ki (Elisabeth Harnois) who spouts flower-child phrases like ""Mellow out man Im not the fuzz"" because shes obsessed with old TV reruns that travel from Earth to Mars as streaming video. Underdeveloped stories can be enhanced if not transformed by inventive animation as proved by the success of ""Rango."" That didnt happen here because the movie produced by Robert Zemeckis and directed by Simon Wells (the great-grandson of H.G. Wells) employs the same motion-capture technology that Mr. Zemeckis used in ""The Polar Express"" and ""A Christmas Carol."" There is motion-capture and motion-capture. When its done with the finesse of ""Avatar"" the process can be both amazing and invisible. When its done with the clumsiness of this production faces look like glove puppets and characters go through motions that are paradoxically lively but lifeless. Mars may need moms but Earth needs good movies and this isnt one of them. Red Riding Hood This tedious retelling of the venerable fairy tale--""Twilight"" with Oedipal kinks--takes place in a medieval village that is plagued by a werewolf and that looks like a shtetl settled by California actors. Watch a clip from Red Riding Hood starring Amanda Seyfried and Gary Oldman. For a while the joke seems intentional. The local beauty played by Amanda Seyfried and torn between two men eventually gets to wear a red outfit but her name is Valerie and the boy she secretly loves Peter (Shiloh Fernandez) has spiked hair. Unfortunately and thats putting it mildly the director Catherine Hardwick (she directed the first ""Twilight"" feature); the writer David Johnson and the denizens of the village are stuck in a style warp between today and the Middle Ages. Every now and then today holds sway ""Omigod you can speak"" Valerie says to the wolf who proves to be a fairly fluent conversationalist. ""Im gonna getcha outa here"" says Henry (Max Irons) the handsome but dull boy Valerie is supposed to marry. Mostly though the movie lumbers along in medieval mode what with Valeries stern father (Billy Burke also from ""Twilight"") telling her that ""its time to put on your harlots robe"" and Gary Oldmans witch-hunting Father Solomon telling everyone that ""during a Blood Moon your very souls are in danger."" Tone is everything in a venture like this and ""Red Riding Hood"" never finds a workable one; the only really good laugh comes when Valerie comments on her grandmothers big eyes big nose and big teeth. (Granny is played by Julie Christie who has fine features but that makes it funnier.) The ostensible mystery concerns the identity of the big bad werewolf (who looks like a creature found on the cutting-room floor of a defunct Claymation studio) but the real mystery is how an amusing idea could have gone so wrong. The movie must have been conceived during a Blood Moon. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com DVD FOCUS ENLARGE Jane Eyre (1943) Cary Fukunaga has said that he grew up watching this black-and-white version with his mother; these days it can be streamed via Netflix. The director was Robert Stevenson who wrote the screenplay with no less a literary light than Aldous Huxley along with John Houseman (of Orson Welless Mercury Theater) and an uncredited Henry Koster. The production is dominated by Mr. Welles; his brooding Rochester has no use for understatement. Joan Fontaine is affecting but not very forceful as Jane. The cast includes Agnes Moorehead and Margaret OBrien who as Rochesters ward Adele struggles sweetly with a French accent. Brazil (1985) Terry Gilliams darkly funny and truly visionary retro-futurist fantasy is a mess dramatically and its turbulent history echoes the battles fought by Orson Welles against studio executives bent on recutting or scuttling his films. A three-disc Criterion release includes Mr. Gilliams 142-minute version plus Universals dreadful 94-minute recut version (with a happy ending) that the studio released unsuccessfully. Theres also a video history chronicling the filmmakers struggles with the studio all of which could have been avoided by the terms of his contract if hed been able to shorten his own cut to 125 minutes. Mamma Mia (2008) Amanda Seyfried is irrestistible as Sophie an ardent bride and the daughter of a former rocker Donna Sheridan (Meryl Streep). Sophie doesnt know the identity of her father so unbeknownst to her mother she invites three plausible candidates from Donnas past to her wedding. Theyre played by Pierce Brosnan Stellan Skarsgard and Colin Firth who sing and dance gamely. Ever since the movie came out Ive been teased for my praise of such old-fashioned entertainment but its really entertaining and Ms. Streep plays lusty joyfulness just as fearlessly as she has ever played tragedy or riveting drama. --Joe Morgenstern Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

"Movie review Mars Needs Moms - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-EntertainmentMovie review Mars Needs MomsWhat this animated tale a about a boy rescuing his mom from the red planet a needs is some absurd charm from Berkeley Breatheds original story.March 11 2011|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Gribble left and Milo in ""Mars Needs Moms."" (ImageMovers Digital )Although it may be true that ""Mars Needs Moms"" the red planet needs emotion more. Or is it more emotion? Either way the result is the same. Instead of breathing life into cartoonist Berkeley Breatheds cheeky kids morality tale the movie a with all its 3-D motion capture animation flash a flatlines. Live versus lifelike continues to be problematic for this particular technique. Despite refinements in the years since filmmaker Robert Zemeckis a a producer on ""Mars"" a pushed it into the long-form storytelling arena in 2004 with ""The Polar Express"" its characters still carry the Stepford look. Director Simon Wells has had his struggles on the emotional front. The filmmaker the great grandson of H.G. Wells inherited the name but little of the originality of his ancestor. Instead his work tends toward the middle-ground beginning with 1991s ""An American Tail Fievel Goes West."" There are usually splashy visuals like the lush palette of ""The Prince of Egypt"" but little heart most disappointingly in his adaptation of great granddads classic novel ""The Time Machine"" in 2002. ""Mars"" with Wells wife Wendy writing the screenplay continues that trend. To that end the look of Mars itself is terrific from the moment its dull reddish surface breaks open to reveal a complex vibrant city underneath. With ""Polar Express"" alums on the creative frontlines led by production designer Doug Chiang and director of photography Robert Presley there is an inventive blend of the sort of high-tech sleekness youd expect from an advanced alien culture alongside the mountains of trash generated by a productive people who havent discovered recycling yet. As to their use of solar power well get to that. There is a compelling story underneath that upper crust as well a a boy realizing how much he loves his mom. And a suitable kid-centric spin a just as he figures it out shes spirited away by Martians and hes racing against time and interplanetary odds to get her back. It took two Seths (no relation) to bring 9-year-old Milo our broccoli-hater at the center of things to simulated life a S. Green the elder giving him all the right moves S. Dusky the younger the voice a for it was a fight over the gross green stuff that starts this whole affair. Thats a real enough mom-kid struggle but any friction fizzles in fights that sound as if there is one beat too many between lines particularly in the opening scenes between Milo and Mom (Joan Cusack) as in ""Miloooooa|"" (one two threea|) ""Aw Mom."" Fortunately things improve on Mars with the entry of Gribble (Dan Fogler) Mars lone human resident a gadget junkie of a guy who is thrilled to have another Earthling in the house. In ""Mars"" Fogler redefines the notion of unbridled glee giving Gribble a double shot of the kinetic energy and guilelessness that is helping him salvage other just-OK movies these days most recently in the 80s-bashing ""Take Me Home Tonight."" In addition to his entertainment value Gribble is an important ally for Milo because he knows his way around the Supervisor (Mindy Sterling) a screeching ancient harpy in charge of security forces. If something akin to the sound of nails-on-the-blackboard was the goal then Sterling succeeds in sterling fashion. Much more successful in every sense is Ki (Elisabeth Harnois) the day-glow graffiti street artist who is covering Mars cityscapes in neon colors. Things light up literally and figuratively every time Harnois Ki shows up and teaming her with Milo and Gribble a again literally and figuratively a almost saves the day (or at least makes it more bearable). In addition to the eerily surreal effect of the characters the story has its own creep factor to deal with. As it turns out Mars doesnt need moms exactly but mom brains solar-powered machine extracted mom brains to be exact. That brainpower is used to program the latest model of nanny-bots who care for each new generation of Martian girls. Never mind the boys they are a disposable commodity a perhaps not the message you want to send young ones. Speaking of which the films one emotional surge comes in a Bambi-like moment that had some of the kids in my vicinity whimpering so parents be forewarned. As breathtakingly visual as the trip to ""Mars"" is the 3-D aspect is overrated and the glasses are getting so heavy they may leave permanent dents on little noses. Worse Breatheds genius that sense of the absurd that he constructs to help kids ride out the darker undercurrents of the tale has gone missing along with Milos mom. Maybe the Martians stole that too. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESWord of Mouth Mars Needs Moms needs to capture more buzzMarch 10 2011Not hard to figure this outJanuary 2 2010MORE STORIES ABOUTEntertainmentRed PlanetMiloCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-mars-needs-moms-20110311,0,7118212.story",200,marsneedsmoms14,marsneedsmoms,latimes
"Mars Needs Moms Movie Needs Mojo | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesMars Needs Moms Movie Needs MojoMars Needs Moms isnt much of a movie but its a great teaching tool for how not to make an animated film.Milo and Ki in Mars Needs Moms.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. March 10 2011 Mars Needs Moms (out of 4) Animation featuring the voices of Seth Dusky (as Seth Green) Joan Cusack Dan Fogler Elisabeth Harnois and Mindy Sterling. Directed by Simon Wells. 88 minutes. Opens March 11 at major theatres. PG Mars Needs Moms isnt much of a movie but its a great teaching tool for how not to make an animated film. Its a sci-fi adventure about Martians kidnapping an Earth mom to help tame kids on the red planet. Its based on a childrens book by Berkeley Breathed best known as the zany mind behind Bloom County a 1980s comic strip that he grew tired of long before his fans did. But Mars Needs Moms isnt a Berkeley Breathed movie. Nor can it really be called the inspiration of director Simon Wells. Both men had to answer to producer Robert Zemeckis who weirdly clings to motion-capture animation despite a general lack of audience enthusiasm for the process. ""Mo-cap"" animation uses real actors shot against a green screen who are then digitally replaced by animated facsimiles. The results as seen in Zemeckiss previous mo-cap features A Christmas Carol Beowulf and The Polar Express can charitably be described as interesting but theyre considerably short of enchanting. Mars Needs Moms has this same enchantment deficit a critical omission for a movie about the joy of family love. Thats mistake No. 1. Mistake No. 2 is the casting. Joan Cusack as the mom was a good choice but shes strangely relegated to the background. Front-and-centre is Seth Green as 9-year-old hero Milo who travels to Mars to rescue mom having decided shes not the ""broccoli bully"" hed complained about. Greens face is on pint-sized Milo but its not his voice we hear. It was scrubbed and replaced by the whiny tones of 11-year-old Seth Dusky after it was determined that 37-year-old Green sounded too old for the part. Well duh. I didnt know about the swap until after the screening and kept wondering why Green who has a very distinctive voice didnt sound like himself. Why didnt they just use a kid in the first place? Faring slightly better as characters are Elisabeth Harnois as Ki a Martian girl who befriends Milo and Dan Fogler as Gribble a mysteriously motivated Earthman who looks like one of the underground street performers in Jean-Pierre Jeunets Micmacs. Ki and Gribble are fun but they dont feel integral to the story about the kid and his mom and thats mistake No. 3. In fact theres not much of a story at all in Mars Needs Moms. Much of the films 88 minutes is taken up with Milo being chased around or falling through the corridors of a dull Martian complex that resembles Darth Vaders lair in the original Star Wars. Speaking of dull mistake No. 4 is the films drab look. Why go to Mars and paint everything in Earth tones? Everything looks dark and flat which isnt aided by mistake No. 5 Mars Needs Moms is in 3-D which further dims the screen and robs the wallet. The film isnt a disaster. It has a positive message about family bonding that parents will love and kids may like it (although the tots at the preview screening I attended seemed awfully squirmy). The final reel suggests how good the movie could have been. Theres actually one scene that is as emotive as any Ive seen in recent films animated or not. But all those mistakes add up. This Mars doesnt need moms it needs mojo.

By Tom Horgen Star Tribune March 30 2011 -- 1012am Video (5039)  Martians are stealing moms from Earth Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Mars Needs Moms"" is a 3-D-animated film shooting for the stars (or in this case Mars). Its craftsmanship showcases the latest in performance-capture technology (a la ""Avatar""). And its story -- about the relationship between a mother and son -- is meant to make you weep (a la ""Toy Story 3""). What ends up onscreen however is simply sufficient. ""Mars Needs Moms"" doesnt crash-land into ""Yogi Bear"" territory but it definitely doesnt soar to ""Toy Story 3"" heights of animated grandeur. While the scope of ""Mars Needs Moms"" concerns an epic space adventure it starts with a familiar predicament Milo whos 9 wont eat his broccoli. Hes sent to bed upset. He wakes up just as Martians kidnap his mom (voiced by Joan Cusack). He gives chase barely making it onto their alien spacecraft. The Martians have transformed the Red Planets innards into a vast city of towering metallic terraces and neon-lit passageways -- like unused set pieces from the ""Star Wars"" prequels. While technologically advanced these aliens are terrible parents. So they kidnap human mothers extract parenting skills from their brains and transfer the knowledge into the ""nanny-bots"" that raise their children. The result is fatal. Also peculiar The Martians are all female led by a despotic matriarch known simply as the Supervisor who resembles E.T. in a wig. Her minions however look like shapely Stormtroopers. So where are the males? The Supervisor has created a high-tech paradise where forward-thinking independent females have banished the primitive buffoonish males even farther underground. Lets think about this for a minute Female Martians seeking independence from traditional mothering roles expel the dopey males thus creating a rigid female utopia where parenting is intergalactically outsourced. Wait a second. Is Disney saying feminism leads to authoritarianism? Nah they couldnt be saying that. Feed Loader Disney ""Mars Needs Moms"" Gibble and Ki Back to the kiddie action. In his quest to save dear mom Milo is joined by two allies Gribble a plump neurotic human who claims hes a marooned astronaut and Ki a rebellious Martian girl whos secretly in love with life on Earth (specifically 1960s American counterculture). At night Ki splashes giant graffiti on the walls of the underground city -- her dissident murals a cross between Pollock and Banksy. While ""Mars Needs Moms"" carries the Disney brand it was made by Robert Zemeckis animation studio which produced ""The Polar Express"" ""Beowolf"" and ""A Christmas Carol."" Like those films the voice actors in ""Mars Needs Moms"" actually had to act out their roles on a sound stage wearing skin-tight black suits. Milos physical appearance is performed by Seth Green but hes voiced by the young Seth Dusky. While the 3-D worlds created for these kinds of films are beautiful to look at theres still something screwy going on with the human faces onscreen. They look creepy like mannequins come to life. ""Mars Needs Moms"" is fast and fun but its also stocked with the usual cavalcade of cloying life lessons. Love your mother (duh). You dont know what youve got till its gone (thanks). And all you need is love (got it). Again simply sufficient. Mars doesnt need moms. It needs brighter ideas.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + In Berkeley Breatheds kitschily titled 2007 childrens book ""Mars Needs Moms a mothers absence-via-alien-abduction makes her attitudinal little boys heart grow fonder all right -- to pretty touching effect. The 3-D animated feature version from director Simon Wells and producer Robert Zemeckis loses the exclamation mark and conveys the same feeling at points but more often just frenetically roves the Red Planet much like Zemeckis filling out ""The Polar Express.Seth Green (""Austin Powers ""Family Guy) does the CG performance-capture thing as Milo a likably smart-alecky 9-year-old who gives his continually tested mom (Joan Cusack) as much grief as he gets -- over chores broccoli and the age-appropriateness of zombie flicks. (Youll wonder naturally what sort of techno-deviltry the filmmakers worked on Greens voice to transform him from professional man-boy to just plain boy; according to production notes they enlisted kid actor Seth Dusky to imitate Greens delivery line for line.) After Milo ends one of their arguments with words he immediately guiltily regrets he creeps down the hall to apologize only to see his zonked-out mother being whisked away by -- ack -- aliens.The audience knows that these E.T.-Mr. Tumnus mashups have been remotely surveilling mother and son all along but why? The answers come once Milo stows away for the quick wormhole hop back to Mars and promptly lands in the company of Gribble (Dan Fogler ""Balls of Fury) a porky slacker-age earthdude lying low amid the Martians mountainous trash heaps. Its no big spoiler to note that Gribble long ago stumbled down the same abductee path as Milo -- Foglers show-stealing trapped-in-the-80s ramblings about ""Top Gun and Cabbage Patch dolls kind of give it away. Suffice it to say hes had plenty of time to learn how the nurture-challenged aliens periodically glom the psyche of a maternally gifted human to program their fleet of nannybots.Cue Milos visually busy scramble to stop his moms impending brain drain with help from Gribble and Ki (Elisabeth Harnois) a Martian on a permanent flower-power high thanks to vintage-TV broadcasts. Some of the 3-D imagery is dazzling like a pivotal scene in which a characters oxygen helmet shatters in slow motion into countless glittery crystalline droplets. But mostly we get pleasantly routine aesthetics from Wells whose resume includes second-tier animation like ""Prince of Egypt and a live-action 2002 adaptation of his great-grandfather H.G. Wellss ""The Time Machine. (You wonder what gramps would have made of the animators burying their Martian society underground -- well reasoned or uninspired? -- although this does set up an amusing early gag about what the Rover program might be overlooking.)Meanwhile the Zemeckis crews character design sensibility continues to be an iffy creative proposition. Watching ""Mars youll likely get a kick out of how clearly the aliens bitchily Orwellian leader captures the mannerisms of actress Mindy Sterling best known as the iron matron from ""Austin Powers. But several years and a few movies on from ""Polar Express that infamous dead-eyed creepiness remains an issue for regular-folk characters. Maybe its time to rethink the house style.Of course wed probably focus less on any of this if Wells and company more fully embraced whats best about their movie that emotionally vital if sometimes snippy mother-kid bond. It doesnt matter much how naturalistic Milos mom looks when youre already feeling genuinely moved by the tears welling up in her eyes. But the whole time Greens character is running around Cusacks is hardly around at all. ""Mars needs Mom more than the filmmakers seem to realize.Tom Russo can be reached at trusso2222gmail.com.

Share Tweet When the Robert Zemeckis-headed studio ImageMovers debuted its first animated feature 2004s The Polar Express many rightly complained about its characters zombie-like appearance. Using motion-capture technology to convert human performances into animation the film got a lot right but failed to capture the spark of humanity. The results were going for winsome but looked creepy instead. But ImageMovers subsequent films Beowulf and A Christmas Carol got a little closer to avoiding the dead eyes that haunted its first effort. They varied in quality but the people looked more like people each time out. With Mars Needs Moms the studio finally gets an entertaining accomplished movie that shows off what its signature technology can do--just in time for ImageMovers to close up shop shuttered by its Disney partners as a cost-saving measure. Zemeckis might employ the technology elsewhere perhaps with a long-threatened remake of Yellow Submarine. But if not at least its going out on a high note. Mars Needs Moms director Simon Wells (The Time Machine) delivers an eye-catching sneakily moving adaptation of the 2007 Mars Needs Moms picture book (written and illustrated by Bloom County creator Berkeley Breathed) about a high-spirited kid named Milo  (performed by Seth Green whose voice was replaced at the 11th hour by child actor Seth Robert Dusky) who tells his mom (Joan Cusack) hed be better off without her then watches in horror as Martians take her away. Turns out that--well you read the title. Stowing away on a Martian craft Milo discovers a grown-up lost boy (Dan Fogler) whos been on Mars since the 1980s (and has the slang to match) after losing his mother to the cruel process that allows Martians to suck the brains from their captives. Together they try to save Milos mom from the same fate. But lets back up Why does Mars need moms? It needs them because its been overtaken by a dystopian matriarchy thats consigned the races males to the planets surface and in the process forgotten how to parent. That sounds like a barbed setup but any satirical points about contemporary gender roles get lost in a mad rush through the matriarchys beautifully realized Death Star-like gray fortress. Its a fun rush though and an intense one too with plenty of grim moments along the way that heighten the sense of danger as Mars Needs Moms moves toward an unexpectedly wrenching finale.  Finished or not ImageMovers goes out for now with a burst of humanity.

Joe Neumaier Thursday March 10 2011 1259 PM Title Mars Needs Moms A boy jumps on a spaceship to outer space to save his mother. With motion-capture performances by Dan Fogler Seth Green Joan Cusack. Director Simon Wells. (128) At area theaters.Its funny how a quality CGI film can surprise you. ""Rango"" is drawing in audiences because of its savvy take on the Western genre and Pixar of course makes storytelling an art. While not every family film can plant a flag here the happily offbeat ""Mars Needs Moms"" turns out to be a charming subversive minor addition to the club.Thats especially remarkable because ""Mars"" was made using motion capture the technology that animates the movements and expressions of actors resulting in creepy (""The Polar Express"") or sublime (""The Lord of the Rings"") performances. The film is a giant step in giving this eye-catching style some heart.Milo (Seth Green) is a typical 9-year-old complaining about vegetables and chores and wishing his mom (Joan Cusack) would just leave him alone. He gets his wish when Martians abduct his mother and bring her to the Red Planet.To save her Milo hops a ride on their rocket discovering an underground society run by super-efficient female Martians. Every 25 years when baby Martians hatch the femalians lacking empathy and kindness themselves steal an Earth mom and extract those qualities from her. The downside Mom gets vaporized.With help from a thirtysomething Earth refugee Gribble (Dan Fogler) and the cute Martian Ki (Elisabeth Harnois) Milo mans up while teaching the Martians to loosen up.The pleasures of ""Mars Needs Moms"" arent immediately evident -- the movie has a dark look and be aware gets a little heavy towards the end -- but its based on a childrens book by Berkeley Breathed creator of the classic comic ""Bloom County"" so theres a shaggy countercultural vibe; if you get in the groove its a hoot.For instance female Martians banish the males to work in a garbage pit because theyre ""hairy tribal guys"" intent on dancing and Ki weaned on a 1970s sitcom is a wannabe flower child whose hippy-dippy style throws off stuck-in-the-80s Gribble and child-of-the-oughts Milo.Fogler is terrific giving Gribble the outsized energy of the late John Candy and the lead Martian meanie (Mindy Sterling Frau Farbissina in the ""Austin Powers"" movies) is a hilariously cantankerous crone. When the movie loses fuel or gets too chase-filled they easily recharge it.And when the Martians speak we (wisely) dont get subtitles yet we understand their gibberish. So will kids 8 and up a crowd that knows about not eating their greens.

"Disney motion-captures a baffling wobbly dud - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Disney motion-captures a baffling wobbly dudMars Needs Moms a 1 1/2 starsMarch 10 2011|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticFeature animation comes at us in so many different technologies and modes of expression these days the possibilities are boundless. So are the pitfalls. A good-looking shell of a movie such as ""Rango"" comes along offering a string of nots -- its not in 3-D its not a sequel its not based on material from another medium its not ashamed of pilfering film history with minimal wit for its own purposes -- and the result is hailed in many quarters (I was in the minority) as a new classic simply because it reminds people of nonanimated Westerns they adore.Now comes a comparative piker ""Mars Needs Moms"" from Walt Disney Pictures. This one is in 3-D and is based on a 2007 Berkeley Breathed picture book. (Hes the ""Bloom County"" creator.) Like ""The Polar Express"" and the recent Disney ""Christmas Carol"" it bears the stamp of producer Robert Zemeckis and his latest advancements in performance-capture animation.This means a fine reliable performer such as Joan Cusack who plays the supporting role of the mom Mars needs sounds looks and moves something like a version of the human Joan Cusack but with most of the compelling facial detail scrubbed away. This brand of performance capture isnt quite human and isnt quite animated and the stylization feels stuck in the uncanny valley of inexpressivity -- which is odd because the whole point of the technology is to enhance the facial mobility and detail not wipe it clean.So plot. Every 25 years on Mars baby Martians pop out of the ground like potatoes and are put in the care of ""Clone Wars""-esque nanny-bots. The Martians ruled by a fearsome matriarch played by Mindy Sterling come to Earth and kidnap one new human mother each generation. Her innate talent for discipline empathy and love is extracted and then implanted it into the nanny-bots. (None of this grim nonsense came from the book which was far more comic -- and cleverly drawn -- than the film directed and co-written by Simon Wells.)The separation and eventual reunion of 9-year-old Milo (Seth Green) and his mom (Cusack) is played out against the tale of the motherless human Milo finds on Mars a slobby computer genius named Gribble (Dan Fogler more strenuous than funny). Mars has one society above ground in control and all-female and another all-male caste of rejects living ""Time Machine""-like far below the planets surface. How do all these narrative elements jell?

Hear me out Avatar is a great myth-minded adventure about a human guy able to project himself into the beatifically peaceful world of the Navi from Pandora. Despite an earthbound script the movie with its computer-generated imagery and 3-D effects is visually magnificent proudly so. Also long. In a parallel universe Mars Needs Moms is a great jaunty adventure about an unruly kid named Milo (Seth Green the right guy for the job) who had no plans to go to Mars but finds himself there anyway. Hes been inadvertently scooped up by the same alien kidnappers who made off with his mother (Joan Cusack custom-fit) to plunder her maternal DNA for child-rearing tips. (Martian surveillance has verified that Milos mom is good at nagging her boy to take out the trash.) Enhanced by nimble ad-libbing from the comedy-trained cast the screenplay is delightful by turns funny and emotional as befits a Disney family fable in which through wacky adversity Mom and kid reaffirm their love for each other while Dad is nowhere in sight. (Hes not dead just away on business.) And with its splendid use of computer-generated motion-capture animation and 3-D effects the movie is also visually magnificent -- modestly so. Plus its half the length of Avatar. I dont know why performance-capture moviemaking -- the kind pioneered in The Polar Express and A Christmas Carol by Robert Zemeckis who also produced Mars Needs Moms -- hasnt received more applause. Thanks to its unique ability to blend both animate and inanimate subjects in one magical landscape it may be the technology-based artistic medium best suited to 3-D projects. Certainly its the right way to go when visiting the Mars of this cool story a wittily conceived planet of curvy female soldiers and sidelined males ruled by a splendidly screechy old crone called the Supervisor. (Shes voiced by Austin Powers excellent Frau Farbissina herself Mindy Sterling.) Milo by the way would be dead on the Red Planet without the help of a fellow human who calls himself Gribble (slam-dunk excitability from Dan Fogler). Another dude whose mom was picked up for Martian study years ago Gribble is a chatterbox a slob with a big heart and a resourceful geek who lends Milo a weight belt so the boy doesnt waft away in zero gravity. Personally I cared more about him than I did about Jake Sully in Avatar. But who says you have to choose? A?

"Movie Review ""Mars Needs Moms"" | Movie Nation Movie Nation Filmgoing movie loving and a good argument. On a good day. Skip to content - Movie Review ""Creature"" Movie Review ""Paul"" - Movie Review ""Mars Needs Moms"" Posted on January 15 2013      by rogerinorlando Youll want to stay through the closing credits of the new motion capture animated adventure ""Mars Needs Moms"" a film from the people who gave us ""The Polar Express."" There are four minutes of clips of the real-live cast of the film Seth Green Joan Cusack and Dan Fogler among them wearing the mo-cap suits dots covering their faces so that the sensors can digitally mimic their movements actions and facial reactions as they act out whats going to be animated. Its fascinating and also the lightest and funniest part of this film based on a book by ""Bloom County"" creator Berkeley Breathed. Though light enough in tone packed with good messages and delivering a couple of lovely touching moments ""Mars"" still has that plastic look that made you wish you were seeing the REAL Tom Hanks in ""Polar Express"" or the REAL Jim Carrey in ""A Christmas Carol."" Cute characters and a ""Star Wars"" derived plot -- rescuing a damsel from a heavily garrisoned ""citadel"" -- drive this tale a movie more interested in action beats than in big laughs. Its not bad and is considerably more kid-friendly than the trippy and more adult-oriented ""Rango."" Its just not as much fun as a live action version of the same story might have been. Milo (voiced by Seth Dusky acted by Green) hates taking out the trash and wont eat his broccoli. And when mom (Joan Cusack) lays down the law -- ""No broccoli no TV"" he revolts. ""My life would be so much better if I didnt have a mom at all."" Milo who looks to be about 11 learns a big life lesson with that. Words can wound. He makes his mom cry. Imagine his guilt when a few hours later shes abducted by aliens. He scrambles after her and learns an awful secret -- ""Mars Needs Moms.""  And not just any moms GOOD moms. Ones who lay down the law teach their children respect discipline manners and values maybe who teach their kids not to kick the seat in front of them at the the movie theater. Martians spy on us pick out a mom doing a good job and grab her so that they can use her brain to encode their nanny robots which they use to raise baby martians miles below the surface of the planet far from the probing eye of the Mars Rover. Milo is at a loss about how to rescue mom until he himself is saved by Gribble a portly subterranean nerd played by Dan Fogler. Gribble stowed away to Mars just like Milo and has survived built robots and filled his own junkyard lair with hi-tech gear. He is surrounded by hordes of goofy dreadlocked outcasts from Mars society whom he can understand (hes built a translator) but cant communicate with. Gribble is trapped in the 80s which is when he arrived. Hes fighting ""the spread of interplanetary communism"" for Ronald Reagan. ""Why do you think they call it The Red Planet?"" Milo has mere hours to convince Gribble to help rescue his mother before her brain is cooked hours to find and meet a Martian graffiti artist (Elisabeth Harnois) in  revolt against the regimented colorless matriarchy of Mars. Director Simon Wells worked on ""Prince of Egypt"" and ""The Time Machine"" and is right at home with the endless digital chases shootouts and such. He and his animators also deliver a couple of those big emotional moments that gave ""Up"" and ""Toy Story 3 their pathos. But laughs? He doesnt do well with the ones the script sets up. Theres subtext here too. Plainly Breathed the author has some mommy issues he was working out -- women running a planet are too busy to nurture their own babies. It all makes for an intricate if slow and somewhat humor-starved early Mothers Day present in which  a boy learns just how much his mom means to him on the Red Planet. ""Mars Needs Moms"" but Milo needs Mom even more. Cast The voices of Seth Dusky Joan Cusack Dan Fogler and Elisabeth Harnois Director Simon Wells Running time 129 Rating PG for sci-fi action and peril.

TWITTER Robert Zemeckis performance capture system which turns life-action into animation gets quite a workout in Disneys ""Mars Needs Moms"" so why does this movie directed by Simon Wells feel so slight? Robert Zemeckis performance capture system which turns life-action into animation gets quite a workout in Mars Needs Moms. Its characters both human and Martian tumble through space slide down chutes chase along corridors that turn every which way and dance around mountains and into caverns created out of huge mounds of trash. The process has also lost those weirdly inhuman faces that plagued The Polar Express Zemeckis first foray into performance capture. In fact so many things in this unique kind of animation especially the designs and all its many details keep getting better and better. So why does Mars Needs Moms feel so slight? Other than Beowulf his most successful performance-capture film to date Zemeckis has chosen to deploy this system in childrens films. Which is just fine as far as that goes but where the technical advances and story sophistication in his Beowulfmpointed toward James Camerons Avatar Mars Needs Moms points toward a ride at Disneyland. This film from Zemickis ImageMovers Digital and appropriately Walt Disney Pictures has been shot and on accommodating screens will be projected in Disney Digital 3D as well as in Imax 3D. So Mars will certainly be a treat for younger family members. But for teens on up the generational scale the interest level will plummet drastically. For that matter it will be interesting to see how Mars in its first week fares against Rango an animated film with considerable sophistication and outreach to older audiences in its second weekend. As with his A Christmas Carol movie Zemeckis paints himself into a digital corner by ignoring adults. Mars does do one thing much better than A Christmas Carol however It has emotions. After all it is based on a childrens novel by cartoonist Berkeley Breathed who admits the book came in reaction to a disobedient son expressing keen dissatisfaction with even having a (nagging) mother. Consequently the entire story about a mom kidnapped by Martians and her rescue by her young son bubbles over with emotions. Its an illustrated laundry lists all the things moms do for their kids -- and that would include the laundry. For this film Zemeckis turns directing chores over to Simon Wells who directed The Time Machine and co-directed the animated The Prince of Egypt. Wells and his wife Wendy adapted the Breathed book with nearly every plot turn driving home the point that kids need moms. Milo age 9 is the focal point. He is enacted by Seth Green and voiced by a much younger Seth named Seth Dusky age 11.The estimable Joan Cusack is Mom but since she spends most of the time under lock and key the major roles fall to an extremely funny Dan Folger as Mars only other human a disheveled techo-wiz named Gribble; Elisabeth Harnois as Ki a rebellious young Martian who learned English watching 70s sitcoms; and Mindy Sperling as the humorless nasty Martian leader whose body appears as mummified as her heart. Designer Doug Chiang has a grand time turning the Red Planet into a giant fun ride from those loopy Martians with triangular heads no real noses and otherworldly bodies and gaits to an underground world of stark simplicity and sterility. Females run the place while men -- Gribble calls them the Hairy Tribe Guys -- get tossed down chutes with the garbage as theyre apparently the most expendable resource on the planet. The entire movie is set up as a race against the clock by Milo to save his mom but the film finds time to take in the Martian civilization in passing a gag-filled and mostly lighthearted re-imagining of our own world if women ruled. (It is odd though how a movie meant to glorify moms is so riddled with anti-feminist concepts. These are of course Martian females not human ones but still ...) Anachronistic dialogue rules for the most part as not only does Ki brim with the hep lingo of the Flower Children era but Gribble who is thirty-something is stuck forever in the 80s when he left planet Earth. The movie shrugs off any real attempt at science fiction other than oxygen helmets for the surface of Mars. The characters still dash around those surfaces in short sleeves in what should be an 87 degrees climate and make the round trip from Earth to Mars which should take about 18 months in a half minute. The skill level of this motion capture animation is getting better all the time. So Mars is accomplished at every level. But the three most important things in movies are story story story so the movie never comes off as the considerable achievement it truly is.

Robert Zemeckis for one though as evidenced by Disneys recent closing of his ImageMovers Digital studio he increasingly appears to be alone in that sentiment. Mars Needs Moms stands as the potentially final Zemeckis-produced motion-capture effort and like The Polar Express Beowulf and A Christmas Carol before it its characters boast the waxy complexions unreal movements and dead eyes of mannequins come to surreal energetic life. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - With an unsettling Joan Cusack facial reproduction lending the proceedings a predictably creepy Madame Tussauds vibe Mars Needs Moms director Simon Wells founders in his attempts to smoothly integrate detailed human figurines into an intergalactic setting. The result is a jarring dissonance that doesnt amplify his tales out-of-this-world fantasticality as much as call undue attention to his aesthetics unconvincing off-putting strangeness. Only in its roller-coaster centerpieces does Mars Needs Moms gain a small measure of visual panache hurtling about with an abandon otherwise lacking in its race-against-time saga. Yet even in those instances imagination is in short supply with rubbery heroes repeatedly plummeting (down chutes primarily) or hopping and running in slow motion--images that (to state what has now become the obvious) are seldom enhanced by pedestrian IMAX 3-D effects.Based on the childrens novel by Berkeley Breathed Wellss film (like his prior adaptation of great-granddad H.G.s The Time Machine) involves a treacherous journey to an extraordinary foreign land. Mere moments after telling Mom (Cusack) that hed be happier without her Milo (Seth Green) finds her being kidnapped by noseless flat-faced Martians; stowing away on their ship he soon touches down on the red planet where a portly lonely Top Gun-referencing geek named Gribble (Dan Fogler spouting 80s-isms as usual) explains the boys perilous new circumstances. On orders from the queenly Supervisor (Mindy Sterling) who rules her subterranean kingdom with militaristic ruthlessness the creatures plan to use a solar-powered device to steal the ""discipline"" skills of Milos mom which theyll use to program the nanny robots that help them care for their young who sprout out of the ground like vegetables. The plot thus hinges on a fundamental illogicality since the chief differentiating characteristic between mothers and machines isnt discipline but compassion--a fact that even Mars Needs Moms itself recognizes since Milo Gribble and unlikely ally Ki (Elisabeth Harnois) a rebel Martian graffiti artist educated in Earthly ways by a 60s-hippie sitcom eventually triumph in part by teaching their red-planet adversaries about the value of love.As it barrels forward with a speed seemingly designed to prevent serious consideration of its increasingly nonsensical tale the film reveals that Mars also hates dads who sport dreadlocks and koala fur and have been exiled to an underground trash dump because theyre too fond of hugging. Such gender-dynamic reversals however are secondary concerns to chases laser fights and persistent heartstring-tugging mawkishness which extends to Gribbles own mommy-snatching sob story and a finale that disingenuously dares to hint at actual tragedy.The underlying suggestion that well-behaved kids are apt to lose their exceptional mothers to covetous outside forces--a notion the narrative tries to overtly address (and consequently dismiss)--remains disquieting. But Mars Needs Moms isnt out to disturb merely to stimulate through light sound and sentimentality much of it borrowed from genre big brothers. The Martians sterile fluorescent blue-gray metropolis as well as the Leni Riefenstahl-ish visions of armies in rigid military formation have been directly downloaded from Tron while the legacy of Star Wars creeps into everything from the plots pressing parent-separation anxieties and villains stormtrooper-style uniforms to its male extraterrestrials furry dancing Rasta-Ewok cuddliness. With originality an alien concept the film proves to be the equivalent of sci-fi-cinema training wheels.1 Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Nick Schager Follow nschager Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

A boy learns to appreciate his mother and saves a planet in the process in the amped-up sci-fi family adventure ""Mars Needs Moms."" Working against an ungainly title and a rather formulaic marketing campaign pic is a modestly enjoyable performance-capture creation bearing the unmistakable imprint of producer Robert Zemeckis. Adults may roll their eyes at the prospect of yet another slick premium-priced videogame posing as a 3D movie but kids boys especially will respond to its high-throttle action and dazzling f/x-laden chase and battle sequences. Imax showings should bolster returns for this Disney release. As the primary advocate of performance capture since 2004s""The Polar Express"" Zemeckis is determined to popularize the format despite its detractors. Certainly Zemeckis products ""Beowulf"" ""Monster House"" and ""A Christmas Carol"" have shown that as the technology becomes more refined the physical animation can look increasingly realistic. Still some viewers have expressed a visceral disdain for the format likening the blank-eyed human characters to walking corpses which is why non-humans like the Navi in ""Avatar"" and the aliens in ""Mars Needs Moms"" fare better. Helmer Simon Wells (who adapted the screenplay with his wife Wendy from Berkeley Breatheds book) infuses the proceedings with brisk energy and aptly a boys sense of wide-eyed wonder. Oddly that boy is played by an actor in his 30s Seth Green whose facial expressions provided the foundation for the performance while young Seth Dusky delivered the dialogue (carefully matched to Greens original voicework). The resulting creation 9-year-old Milo is introduced locked in a battle of wills with his mom (Joan Cusack) while his dad (Tom Everett Scott) is away on business. Refusing to eat his dinner do his chores or heed any of his mothers nagging demands Milo insists things would be better if he didnt have a mom but soon regrets his words when shes abducted by fleet-footed aliens. While his mom sleeps under the eye of her captors Milo steals away aboard the spaceship. Landing on Mars Milo begins to make his way through the planets various underground strata and mazelike tunnels. Guided by a mysterious strangers voice he manages to elude the Martian army (looking like transplants from ""Triumph of the Will"") hiding briefly with a tribe of good-natured trash-dwelling Martian Rastafarians led by Wingnut (Kevin Cahoon). Trying to describe what a mother does Milo mimes sweeping and feeding; this perplexes them. Nearby Milo meets Gribble (Dan Fogler) a human who followed his own mom to Mars during a similar abduction 25 years earlier. As Gribble helpfully explains Martians are hatched without parents and the adults of the species are unable to raise the young on their own. So every few decades they land on Earth abduct a human mother and download her powers of discipline passing those skills on to the fleet of Nannybots who will care for them. The notion that human mothers are the universes most accomplished disciplinarians is perhaps the films most inventive conceit. Gribble gives Milo a Martian watch that indicates how much time remains before his mom is irrevocably downloaded. (The downloading of Gribbles mom is shown briefly; her final fate potentially upsetting to little ones is implied.) While attempting the rescue they encounter the evil Supervisor (Mindy Sterling riffing on her Frau Farbissina from ""Austin Powers"") and the kindly earth-friendly graffiti tagger Ki (Elisabeth Harnois) a Banksy from beyond. As the various forces convene building up to a climactic battle sequence the plots preposterousness becomes irrelevant; its primary goal at this point is to deliver thrills. Late in the game theres a key moment between mother and child thats as poignant as it is anachronistic as manipulative as it is effective. On a technical level ""Mars Needs Moms"" is well assembled and proficiently directed. Production design however appears to be such a pastiche of sci-fi classics that one can only hope its intended as homage.
