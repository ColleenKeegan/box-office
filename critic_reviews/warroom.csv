The real-estate agent who comes for a walk-through Elizabeth Jordan (Priscilla C. Shirer) mentions trouble with her husband Tony (T. C. Stallings) and Clara soon offers her a solution by means of a total commitment to faith and prayer. The movie directed by Alex Kendrick blends blandly palliative wish fulfillment and exuberant nearly possessed fervor. Clara is a sparkplug of brisk energy whose positive outlook and wry humor are matched by an oratorical extravagance that wouldnt be out of place in a Pentecostal pulpit. The movies main characters are black but race doesnt figure in the action; the story pivots on class divisions and economic success comes off as the great unifier. Despite Claras visionary ecstasy Kendricks view of Christian devotion involves only trivial sacrifices and offers a gospel of self-help that masks its wider doctrinal implications.      --Richard Brody Goings On A free New York City events app What to do tonight Follow goingson About Us FAQ Strongbox Customer Care Cartoon Bank On The Town RSS Contact Us The New Yorker Store Careers Reprints/Permissions Press The New Yorker Media Kit Conde Nast Digital Subscribe to a magazine View All Titles - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Allure Architectural Digest Bon Appetit Brides Conde Nast Traveler Details Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ Lucky Self Teen Vogue The New Yorker Vanity Fair Vogue W Wired Other Conde Nast sites - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Allure Architectural Digest Ars Technica Bon Appetit Brides.com Conde Nast Traveler Concierge Details Epicurious Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ Hotel Chatter Jaunted Lucky NutritionData Reddit The Scene Self Style Teen Vogue Vanity Fair Vegas Chatter Vogue W Wired Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement (effective January 1 2014) and Privacy Policy (effective January 1 2014).

"War Room - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire War Room Posted by Christy Lemire on September 11 2015 72 Comments Sony Pictures Rated PG for thematic elements throughout. Running time 120 minutes. One and a half stars out of four. ""War Room"" is the most slickly made faith-based film Ive seen yet in terms of production values but that doesnt make it quote-unquote good per se. It certainly looks better than say the Nicolas Cage version of ""Left Behind"" a dull groaner about the end times. Its not nearly as top-to-bottom atrocious as the hilariously inept ""Kirk Camerons Saving Christmas"" (although its just about as subtle). And it has more moments of emotional honesty than the overtly wacky ""Moms Night Out"" although not many. Despite its glossy visuals -- including lean camerawork and smooth editing -- its still stuck with a script that repeatedly hammers you over the head with its proselytizing. Which is strange given that its hard to imagine anyone seeing ""War Room"" who wasnt already a true believer. And its a fervent audience as evidenced by the movies No. 1 status at the box office this past weekend beating out ""Straight Outta Compton."" I had to see a matinee of it out of sheer curiosity if nothing else. And ""War Room"" is indeed a curiosity -- a strange beast with sleek packaging and a silly script. It basically preaches that a woman can transform her lying sneaking stealing husband out of his evil ways through prayer. From the outset of the film from director and co-writer Alex Kendrick (whose previous faith-based efforts include ""Fireproof"" and ""Courageous"") its clear that Tony Jordan (former pro football player T.C. Stallings) is not a good dude. A traveling pharmaceuticals salesman hes charismatic when hes out on the road -- especially with the foxy ladies who cross his path -- but abrupt and dismissive once he returns to his expansive North Carolina home. His wife successful real estate agent Elizabeth (Priscilla C. Shirer a preacher making a surprisingly confident acting debut) tries to stay strong and withstand his cruelty for the greater good of the family but their sweet bright daughter Danielle (Alena Pitts) has a hard time hiding how much her fathers distance hurts her. (Pitts gives the most authentic performance of the entire cast by the way. The few decently moving scenes feature her in moment-of-truth conversations with each of the actors playing her parents. But then she gets stuck anchoring an awkward subplot involving competitive double-dutch rope-jumping which apparently is a real thing.) Just in time though Elizabeth takes on a new client the elderly and pious Miss Clara (Karen Abercrombie) a widow whos ready to sell her 100-year-old house. Miss Clara is such an egregious example of the Magical Negro figure -- even in a film populated predominately by black actors -- shes borderline offensive and unintentionally hilarious. Shes pushy and outspoken but also clairvoyant apparently because within minutes of meeting Elizabeth she senses that her marriage is in trouble. Clearly going to church more is the answer. But Elizabeth must go further than that. She must do what Miss Clara has done which is remove all the clothes shoes and handbags from one of her closets and turn it exclusively into a room for prayer. This is the war room of the films title the place to strategize with scripture. (Viewers who live in lofts -- or anywhere in New York City for that matter -- will have trouble replicating this exercise at home.) And magically it works In no time Tony has opened his heart to Jesus and admitted the error of his wicked ways. First he (almost) cheats on Elizabeth and loses his job when he gets caught selling samples on the side. But really all her prayers are answered pretty quickly. Tony even gets in on Danielles double-dutch action which held no interest for him previously. The Lord truly works in mysterious ways. But ""War Room"" is also about Satan as evidenced by Elizabeths bizarre monologue in which she walks around her house -- and even steps outside into the yard -- shouting at the devil to leave her family alone as overwhelming inspirational music swells in the background. Kendrick (who co-wrote the script with his brother Stephen) doesnt even bother with the obvious cutaway shot of baffled neighbors reacting to this late-night rant for a quick laugh. This climactic moment is deadly serious. Such is the bubble of piety in which this film exists. Miss Clara gets the last word though. In increasingly passionate tones she wails on and on about the need to create an army of prayer warriors throughout this land once again perpetuating the notion of Christian persecution. As her booming narration continues -- I mean shes actually shouting at this point -- images of people all over the world and various walks of life flash across the screen. Theyre all praying. Theyre all united. Im sure its a fortifying message for the faithful in the audience but its unlikely to reach the people whod rather use their closets for hanging clothes.

Stallings 72 Comments on ""War Room"" September 11 2015  by  Wendy     The curiosity you had to want to know what the buzz was about that made this movie 1 was exactly the point. You take what you wanted from the movie which just like in your opinion was something negative. But you still made a contribution to a faith-based movie so thank you. I will pray for you to have eyes to see and ears to hear. So when the day comes you may feel quite different and then understand what the true meaning of this movie was about not just about an empty closet with papers taped to a wall. Know the interior not focus on the exterior. Reply September 19 2015  by  mrynsa     well said Reply September 22 2015  by  Dawesi     ""slickly made faith-based film Ive seen yet in terms of production values"" production values and the script (the sickly part) are two things in the professional film world. learn something about film then write. Reply September 27 2015  by  Misty     Amen Wendy Reply September 11 2015  by  Kelly     Just has a bit of a family tiff because someone in our family wanted us to ALL go see it. I couldnt stop myself from saying ""Oh thats the crazy Christian movie"" And now theres a fight and Im hiding in a bedroom wishing I could be anywhere but here. Christians is it possible you could just leave us alone? I dont want to be preached at for two hours and Im not stupid enough to fall for the crap. Reply September 11 2015  by  Christy Lemire     Youll have to let me know how that all turns out. Reply September 12 2015  by  Kayla     Sorry you were pushed to experience something you didnt want to. . Sometimes people who believe something is powerful and impacted their life mistakenly think it will help others the same way. Dont hold it against them. They just love ya and dont quite know how to show it. Reply September 12 2015  by  Elizabeth     The movie was great you had the option of walking out of the movie just as I do when I dont like one. Its wonderful to have options when you want to go out to watch a movie. This was not only entertainment but also a life changing movie I know many of us needed it. Reply September 13 2015  by  CK     How can she review a movie she walks out of? Shes a professional reviewer. A regular person can stop watching/walk out of a movie they dont like but this is quite literally her job. Reply September 13 2015  by  Jay Schwartz     Thats funny thats the same thing my mother said about Christianity. She became a Christian at the tender age of 73. Prayer works. Not on our timing. But Gods. Reply September 13 2015  by  S. Meyer     Oh you sound so kind and open-minded - NOT Reply September 14 2015  by  Ginny     Interesting. I dont believe you are being preached at. And certainly you do not have to go see the movie or can walk out if you feel you are. Reply September 16 2015  by  Mikey     So you think all Christians are stupid huh. Well Im not stupid Ill pray for you and hope that you see the light Reply September 19 2015  by  mrynsa     you can say no and get over it... Reply October 6 2015  by  ChrisB     Lol dont worry no one is forcing you to go see it. And no one forces you to listen. If you ever feel that way due to Christians then they are not true followers of Christ but followers of religion. There are nominal Christians and then there are true Christians followers of Christ who not only listen to Christ but live like Christ. Reply October 15 2015  by  Linn     so you love your family enough to go the movie with them...and cant keep your opinions or negative attitude to yourself so that the family you love can simply enjoy the movie and not have a fight at home? Would it be so difficult--to just give those two hours to family-and leave it at that? You can sit in the darkened theater your mind can wander wherever (just dont text please...) and at the end say something neutral and true about what you saw--I dont know-the little girl was a really good actress--any comment that wont make the people that attended it with you (you said family) uncomfortable angry or defensive. Even though you are a real live person doesnt mean you cant be an actor for a little while...My opinion. Can you accept that some movies can be made for an audience different from you? Its two hours of your life.... Or-next time--man-up and respectfully decline the movie invite with a believable excuse. Protect your family members from your disdain--and avoid the conflict. Just a thought. Reply December 4 2015  by  Larry     Kelly there was no one that made you buy a ticket You knew what the movie was about before you went to see it If the movie Had sex people getting shot using drugs dirty language Climate Change the world coming to an end Aliens You might have enjoyed it Reply April 10 2016  by  Olubunmi Mabel     Thank you Reply September 11 2015  by  Jessica     I have heard nothing but great reviews about this movie from family friends and aquaintances. It is difficult to connect to a movie such as this if you dont understand or have truly experienced the power of prayer. Maybe instead of commenting and submitting a negative review you should consider finding out the reason why you feel this way when so many others dont. This may be the opportunity to gain understanding and become closer to God. As for me and family I will be going to see this movie soon. God Bless you Reply September 13 2015  by  Ray     Its easy to understand why she doesnt feel the same way as many others she hasnt indoctrinated with the beliefs that other reviewers hold. If one views this movie without utilizing any critical thinking skills then Im sure itll come off as one of the greatest films of the 21st century. However there is there is still a sane minoritythat will see the film for exactly what it is. Welcome to a review by one of them. I know youll love the movie though. Its right up your alley. Reply September 13 2015  by  CK     Have you considered that your family friends and acquaintances might be biased? This movie is quite literally preaching to the choir. If you already think prayer works and feel like this movie is powerful awesome. You dont really need a movie to echo your own views to feel more secure about them do you? I think its possible to separate two things (1) the movies message and the (debatable) importance of it) and (2) besides the importance (or lack thereof) of prayer is the movie actually a story worth watching/well-made? It seems like Mrs. Lemire is trying to address 2. You seem to be more concerned with 1. Yes whether a movie is good or not is entirely subjective but I think a film should have more than just a powerful message to be good. It sounds like the filmmakers of War Room were concerned with getting their message across and not much about the other aspects of filmmaking. Reply September 19 2015  by  Tim     Its not preaching to the choir at all. The fact of the matter is the church doesnt pray enough. I am not knocking means of the world but all too often we resort to that as opposed to getting on our knees and petitioning our Father who love us more than anything and who truly knows whats best for us. This is a movie to wake up Christians. The prayer of a righteous man (or woman) accomplishes much Even Jesus own disciples petitioned him to teach them to pray. We could learn from those men. Reply September 20 2015  by  CK     Well preaching to the choir is defined as ""speaking as if to convince a person or group of something which that person or group already believes"". I doubt many non-Christians are going to suddenly start praying because of a ham-fisted film so this is literally just a reminder to people who already pray that they should continue to pray. Pretty close to the literal definition of the phrase/where the idiom came from. ""The fact of the matter is the church doesnt pray enough."" What is ""the church""? A particular church? All of Christianity? Thats quite the generalization. Im sure different churches pray to different degrees. ""I am not knocking means of the world but all too often we resort to that as opposed to getting on our knees and petitioning our Father who love us more than anything and who truly knows whats best for us."" But is there real proof that prayer has ever actually made a change in the world? Or do we do it to make us feel better about our issues? ""The prayer of a righteous man (or woman) accomplishes much"" Like what specifically? Reply October 18 2015  by  Lr     Obviously not in your life... and thats very sad. Try it.. Seek God with all your heart soul and mind and you too will see His glory transforming your life. October 25 2015  by  Stacy     ""The Church"" is not a generalization. Its a term for the body or group of believers in Christ. This doesnt conform to denominations. September 25 2015  by  Helen     The best comment Ive read Thank you Reply September 25 2015  by  Chris     I have to agree with your comment. I am a strong Christian who has a close relationship with God and I think the movie is terrible and makes christians look like a bunch of in your face preachers with no taste. Reply September 30 2015  by  Sugaramp;Spice     ""You dont really need a movie to echo your own views to feel more secure"" Its not about feeling secure its about getting to watch a movie that has the same worldview you do. The vast majority of movies are all about sex violence etc. Some people like me sure appreciate a movie like this once in awhile. I watch regualr movies too last two I watched was Trainwreck and Mad Max. Well made moviesgreat acting... but they could have toned it down....particularly in Trainwreck I especially hate hate cussing... Anyway hope this helps you understand why Christians are so eager to go watch a movie that they can relate to (cause there is not much out there and the handful of movies that do exist are low budget- sad reality for us). Reply November 20 2015  by  Garian     CK your right honestly the movie was made to make a direct message to the body of Christ who has experienced trials in their walk. Also it was made for the reassurance that God does honor and answer prayer. Lastly for those that walked away from Christ (backslide) or curious about Gods power thereof God has hes way of using such an awesome movie and inspire their heart. So this movie isnt about winning awards or getting the approval simple opinion of a critic its a movie for seeking truth. So since you dont know truth why do you bother to entertain this comment forum. Shouldnt you be enjoying your life. Cause without Christ this life is the only enjoyed reward you obtain. Dont believe me trying asking Jesus. Church Reply September 21 2015  by  Diane Perdue     This movie is great This movie should win a award This movie can change a non believer life through prayer God wants us to have a relationship with him. Reply September 11 2015  by  Wendy     But the natural [unbelieving] man does not accept the things [the teachings and revelations] of the Spirit of God for they are foolishness [absurd and illogical] to him; and he is incapable of understanding them because they are spiritually discerned and appreciated [and he is unqualified to judge spiritual matters]. While it is Gods desire (yes your Creator) that all will come to know and accept Him sadly many will not. Therefore those who dont know Him and watch this may feel nudged to turn from their selfish prideful ways and serve the One true Savior. Or at the very least will begin to desire a life different than the one they currently have. Others however (like the critic of this movie) will go on attempting to fight the Truth and create this idea that Christ Followers are a bunch of loony people. Granted some are but it has nothing to do with God. This movie is medicine for the souls because for Believers this is a reminder that we have to unite in prayer to offset the opposition of our Faith. God always answers prayers it may not always look the way we want or when we want but He responds. The message of this marriage is that this woman can not control her spouse but she can trust God to provide her the worth and acceptance that comes from Him regardless if her spouse or the world lets her down. For Beleuvers it doesnt matter what we see or how we feel our hope will always be in His promises to His children. And because He loves us enough not to let us be comfortable in our sinful ways we are called to love the unbeliever because He first loved you and me. Staying the course Reply September 11 2015  by  steve morris     very well said....the critic needs just to sit back and let go of his negative thoughts while watching this movie..i havent seen it and probably wont because of my circumstances..but i know what the movie is trying to tell people just by watching the trailer...GOD does work in mysterious ways...but the movie isnt real life and what happens here is not on the same time line as real time so im sure the time it took for events to unfold was not this quick in real life...stop your negativity and let the movie guide you Reply September 13 2015  by  Kelly     Well said Reply September 13 2015  by  CK     If you need a poorly-made movie to remind you of the strength of prayer then do you really believe in the strength of prayer that much? Reply September 21 2015  by  Dgt;M     Are you paid to be rude or this is the real you? Everyone needs Prayer in their lives including you Smile God Loves You Reply September 19 2015  by  J. Bass     Very powerful and proper response. The only thing that I would like to add is we cannot change others but God can. We dont pray our will over their lives but His will be done. Then we trust Him to do what only He can how only He can in and through His creation. Reply September 12 2015  by  big shot     ""Prayer how to do nothing and still think youre helping"" Reply September 12 2015  by  Wendy     If youre an unbeliever then youre right. Sheep only respond to the voice of their Shepard because he knows them and they know him. Likewise God is our Good Shepard. He knows us and we know Him. If you are not His sheep your prayers fall on deaf ears. But in order to pray and it be effective you have to believe. Your Heavenly Father wants you to believe so He can show you His faithfulness. You have been wounded and so its hard for you to trust. I get it. But even as Believers God does not promise is a life free of disappointment. How sad to believe this world is it. There is a heaven and a hell. Why risk believing there is not. When we die we will all spend eternity somewhere. If you can get your hands on a copy of The Case For Christ please read it. It is about an atheist who tried with great tenacity to disprove the existence of Christ and His deity but could not. And during it all he became a believer. There are many today who believed in the theory of evolution who now have recanted because technology today has disproved many of Darwins theories. Best wishes Reply September 13 2015  by  CK     Can you please prove to me a time that prayer has made a tangible difference in someones life? As in the positive effect can be proven to be a DIRECT effect of praying. ""How sad to believe this world is it. There is a heaven and a hell. Why risk believing there is not."" Actually I think its kind of sad to believe that there is a heaven and hell. That you should be good because if you arent youll be punished for the rest of eternity and if you are good youll live in bliss for the rest of eternity. Is a person truly a good person if they only commit good acts to avoid punishment and gain bliss? Why not be a good person and help other human beings out solely because its the right thing to do? Do humans really need hell hanging over their heads in order to be good people? I think that promotes a quite bleak view of people to be honest with you. Furthermore ""why risk believing there is not"" is a version of Pascals Wager (https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_Wager). The idea is quite easily disproved how do you know which religion to pick? In most religions there is a punishment for not being a ""true believer"" in the ""correct"" god. So how do you know Christianity is the ""right"" religion? What if the Christian god doesnt exist but only the Buddhist ones do? Then Christians unfortunately picked incorrectly. ""If you can get your hands on a copy of The Case For Christ please read it. It is about an atheist who tried with great tenacity to disprove the existence of Christ and His deity but could not."" Ah one of my favorite logical fallacies the burden of proof logical fallacy. In a nutshell it is ""I need not prove my claim you must prove it is false"". The burden of proof is ALWAYS on the person making the assertion; in this instance that god exists. If youre claiming that god exists then you must prove it. The burden of proof isnt on the person who is NOT making the claim. Heres an example lets say that I claim that we are perpetually surrounded by small pink invisible unicorns. You cant see the unicorns you cant touch them and you cant detect their presence by any means spiritual or scientific. Would you immediately take my claim at face value? Or would you say something like ""BS I dont believe you. Prove to me that these unicorns exist.""? I think most people would say the latter because the assertion is ridiculous that these unicorns exist. A similar burden of proof comes with god if you are claiming that god exists then you must prove that fact. It is not on other people who are NOT making the assertion to prove that god DOESNT exist. A similar analogy is Russells teapot. ""There are many today who believed in the theory of evolution who now have recanted because technology today has disproved many of Darwins theories."" What? How has ""technology"" disproved many of Darwins theories? His theories werent perfect (believe it or not science has advanced a bit since 1859) but the theory of evolution has been soundly proven multiple times by many different groups of unassociated scientists working separately. But people believe what they want to even when evolution has been proven. Reply September 14 2015  by  Wendy     Wow Youve said a lot here and I appreciate your feedback. As I stated in an earlier post - the bible which I completely believe as the authoritative word of God is very clear that as an unbeliever you will always view His truths and those who believe as foolishness and absurd. And for that reason it wouldnt matter how many examples I or any believer post here you will find a way to disprove. It is clear that you dont understand it is not about our goodness that gets us into heaven because we (including me) could never be good enough. I deserve hell. But it is what Christ did and if you believe those accounts and Who He is then by His grace we are saved from what we deserve. So it is not about hanging anything over anyone. Gods love and grace is available for all who accept it. He is not a kill-joy God. My guess is you too have been so disappointed in life that you cannot see beyond your own human intelligence and for that reason I will not argue with you about any r elitism theories. I would encourage anyone to examine my words by seeking the truth rather than believing your bully- like responses hold any merit. I am not angry with you and only expect you to respond in this way. I am called to respectfully respect your opinions and to love and pray for you (even though I dont know you personally). As Christ followers we are not promised a life of easy living but our faith and hope goes beyond our natural senses. Its a bonus when Gods blessing are tangibly visible. But even when they are not - He is still God and forever faithful. Like me - there will come a day when you will take your last breathe. It may be sudden or it may be slow enough for you to call out to someone or something bigger than you because most face death with rear fear and regret. I dont want that for you. I want to live a long and productive life but unlike you I have faith that while my physical body may return to the earth - my soul will spend eternity with the One who loved me and gave Himself for me. For those who refuse to believe this is your ""heaven"" so enjoy it now. For us as Beleuvers this is as bad as it will ever get for us here on earth. Glory Best wishes Reply September 15 2015  by  CK     Interesting. You say you appreciate my feedback but you accuse me of not understanding you claim I have been disappointed in life you say I cant see beyond my own intelligence you accuse me of being an elitist and you call me a bully. It seems like youre trying to be nice because you think its what god wants you to do but youre actually upset with me or at least you didnt especially like my response. I enjoy how you couched your disapproval in religious rhetoric and faux kindness though. You also didnt actually respond to any of my points but instead erected numerous straw men and went off on tangents completely unrelated to the points I brought up. However I will address your points directly in an attempt to have an actual back-and-forth of substance. ""the bible which I completely believe as the authoritative word of God is very clear that as an unbeliever you will always view His truths and those who believe as foolishness and absurd"" I dont think youre foolish and absurd. I think religion has issues but it also has value. Its the fundamentalists of any religion that ruin it for everyone else. If faith/religion helps even one person overcome great tragedy in their life or overcome depression then it is a worthy cause. However religion has also been the source of huge wars throughout history. Literally billions of people have been murdered because they observed the wrong religion or were just in the wrong place at the wrong time during religion-related slaughter. Hell just recently weve had radical fundamentalist Muslims commit jihads in the name of Muhammad. This seems like a net negative on humanity. ""It is clear that you dont understand it is not about our goodness that gets us into heaven because we (including me) could never be good enough. I deserve hell. But it is what Christ did and if you believe those accounts and Who He is then by His grace we are saved from what we deserve."" Wow so then it doesnt matter what our actions are here on Earth? So if Joe decides to murder 1000 people then he will still get into Heaven because of what Christ did and because of Christs grace? That seems pretty messed up to me. Im also confused about why a guy who lived literally two millennia ago and who we have very little information about besides likely apocryphal stories (unless you have proof of Jesus supposed feats) is treated so majestically. He must have had great PR ""So it is not about hanging anything over anyone."" I never said anything was about hanging anything over anyone. What is this in response to? ""He is not a kill-joy God."" Yeah I also never said god was a killjoy. I sense a straw man theme here. ""My guess is you too have been so disappointed in life that you cannot see beyond your own human intelligence"" Actually I have to say that Ive lived a pretty lucky life so far A lot of wonderful things have happened to me but nice assumption there. Do you think someone could only possibly not believe in god because their life has been disappointing? Thats a really sad perspective and the inherent implication is that everyone who believes in god lives an amazing life. Thats clearly not true. I can see beyond intelligence but thanks for thinking I cant. ""for that reason I will not argue with you about any r elitism theories."" Huh? What ""elitism theories""? What even is an elitism theory? ""I would encourage anyone to examine my words by seeking the truth rather than believing your bully- like responses hold any merit."" I wholeheartedly agree People should definitely 100% seek truth. What is true about god? Here is what we know about god s/he is an omnipotent all-seeing all-powerful mystical being who resides in Heaven and controls everything that happens. S/he also created life and the universe. If s/he is so powerful you think it would be quite easy for him/her to come down briefly and show everyone that s/he exists right? I mean s/hes done WAY more difficult things than that in his/her existence. Why not come down here and really show the atheists and non-Christians whats what? Oh dont worry I know you already have a convenient explanation about ""gods plan"" and ""thats not how it works"" (even though if god is really the being you think s/he is then we puny humans could never comprehend how god works). This is only tangentially related but do you think we have free will? Because believing in the existence of god means you think we dont have free will. After all if s/hes omnipotent then s/he decided what everyone would do long before they ever existed right? S/he made the world and gave everyone life and decided exactly what everyone would do for eternity. So really god by his/her own rules is responsible for all the despicable acts every human being has ever committed. Thats pretty messed up Whether or not god exists Im not sure I want to believe in this god anymore. Also please dont use ad hominem attacks. I politely responded to your comment and in response I get called a bully. Good to know my response both did not hold any merit and you simultaneously appreciated my feedback. ""I am not angry with you and only expect you to respond in this way."" Great to know I am also not angry with you In what way? Calmly providing logical counterpoints to extreme religiosity? ""I am called to respectfully respect your opinions and to love and pray for you (even though I dont know you personally)."" Great Im glad you respectfully respect my opinions. I also respectfully respect your opinions Wow you must be such an awesome person to love and pray for me even though you dont know me personally I also wish the best for you in life which is the same exact thing but without the unnecessary religious component. You see its possible to wish the best for your fellow human beings without believing in an imaginary man in the sky who controls everything but who we have no proof exists. ""As Christ followers we are not promised a life of easy living but our faith and hope goes beyond our natural senses. Its a bonus when Gods blessing are tangibly visible. But even when they are not - He is still God and forever faithful."" As an Invisible Pink Unicorn follower I am not promised a life of easy living but my faith and hope goes beyond our natural senses. Its a bonus when the Unicorns blessings are tangibly visible. But even when they are not - They are still the Unicorns and forever faithful. ""Like me - there will come a day when you will take your last breathe."" I think you mean breath. Breathe is a verb. ""It may be sudden or it may be slow enough for you to call out to someone or something bigger than you because most face death with rear fear and regret."" Youre totally correct. Death is the scariest thing any human nay any living creature can face. It is literally the end of consciousness and existence. It is nothingness. Thats why I totally understand why humans several thousand years ago invented religion in order to help them cope with death. That makes complete sense to me. But I like to think weve moved forward at least slightly in those couple thousand years. Enough to be able to confront death and realize that we dont know that theres anything after. Maybe Heaven and god exist My only point is that we cant know that for sure. I choose not to believe things that have been made up and have no proof but everyone else is free to do whatever theyd like to. I fear death and Im sure the end of my life will not be fun. However I hope I wont need to make up deities to make myself feel better about ending my consciousness. ""For those who refuse to believe this is your ""heaven"" so enjoy it now. For us as Beleuvers this is as bad as it will ever get for us here on earth. Glory"" WAIT A HOT SECOND What happened to ""It is clear that you dont understand it is not about our goodness that gets us into heaven because we (including me) could never be good enough. I deserve hell. But it is what Christ did and if you believe those accounts and Who He is then by His grace we are saved from what we deserve.""??? I thought christ did all that stuff for our sins and that god loves me too? So Im going to get into Heaven regardless because I would never be good enough for it if youre not. Thankfully christ helped us out on that front Let me just tell you right now I am already very excited to continue this conversation in Heaven See you there in a while We can discuss this for eternity when we arrive September 15 2015  by  Wendy     CK I am not sure with your last post that bc you combined my statements with your response that it will not allow me to reply or if in fact a moderator has deterred us from continuing on that thread. Nonetheless less - I want to apologize for anything that I have said that came across as offensive or condescending. And in one area I wasnt calling you an elitist I was attempting to spell revolutionist when referencing theories. I guess for me I thought I was attempting to respond to your statements without having an attacking tone. I feel your responses are just that. But I will accept responsibility in setting a defensive tone even that is not my intentions. I am honestly not trying to dodge your questions but honestly as an unbeliever youre not saying anything new that hasnt been said a zillion times before. I have no desire to banter with you to when some religious argument. It is clear you have not read or study any books of the bible. We have differences of opinions and I am ok with that. Because at the end of the day - if my faith in God was for not and I die and there is no heaven and hell - then thats it. But if there is and the God of this universe is the only One true God - I will enjoy eternity with Him and my other brothers and sisters in Christ and you - eternal death - never ending sorrow and pain. For believers or pain and suffering is temporary. I believe this and you dont. Ok. There is nothing I am going to say good or bad defending the Faith or otherwise will keep you from further attacks whether its your intentions or not. My purpose was to not really defend a faith base movie as much as I wanted to defend God and what He is about. But sometimes the best defense is no defense. He doesnt need my help in a bantering this way. Again I am sorry. So Mr. CK as they say on the show Shark Tank...""Im out"" Best wishes... Reply September 15 2015  by  Wendy     I also want to apologize for typos and grammatical errors. Sometimes my thoughts get ahead of me trying to hen-peck type on my phone.  September 20 2015  by  CK     I just quoted portions of your comment and then made my response to them underneath. Is that what youre referring to or something else? No worries. Oh OK revolutionist is very different from elitist I understand the typo. To rewrite your sentence with the typo fixed ""My guess is you too have been so disappointed in life that you cannot see beyond your own human intelligence and for that reason I will not argue with you about any revolutionist theories."" What are revolutionist theories? This is a genuine question coming from my curiosity - Ive never heard revolutionist used like that in the context of a discussion on religion. ""honestly as an unbeliever youre not saying anything new that hasnt been said a zillion times before."" To be clear my intention is not to say something knew. People have been arguing about religion for millennia. To say something completely new on the topic Id either have to be extremely original attack it from a very odd angle or perhaps be some sort of genius that thinks of something no one else has ever brought up before. I dont think I am/Im doing any of those things but I bring up anti-religion arguments that have been echoed many times because in all of my conversations with religious people they dodge my logical questions and just fall back on things like ""belief"" ""faith"" and ""god knows/does everything he has a reason for everything we dont know his plan and we cant know it"". I find that reasoning anti-intellectual extremely tiring and circular simultaneously. If you want to go solely off belief/faith/prayer and use confirmation bias to harden your beliefs then go for it. But I encourage you to logically deconstruct religion and what its asking you to believe. Do you need to believe in god to be a good person? Does there need to be a promise of Heaven/threat of Hell in order to give to charity help the homeless and generally be a good person? Does believing in god provide something to your life that would feel empty without him? Ive already brought up this point so Ill be brief in going over it again but I truly believe that not believing in god and still being a good person is more powerful. I believe that people dont need a false all-powerful diety to be good. They are inherently good. ""I have no desire to banter with you to when some religious argument."" Its fascinating to me that no religious person will have a serious debate about their beliefs and the philosophical implications of them. Critical thinking is definitely a good trait to have IMO. ""It is clear you have not read or study any books of the bible."" Not only have I read the bible but Ive studied it extensively. I grew up a Christian (was baptized first communion was confirmed the whole nine yards) and thats exactly what caused me to become non-religious. The absurdity of the whole idea boggled my mind and the more I critically examined it the less sense it made to me. I also studied Religion in college (one of the majors my college offered) so I have critically broken down a number of religious texts and definitely the bible. The best way to counteract religion is to truly know it. Some of the stuff in the Old Testament is truly batshit psycho crazy and indicative of a culture that is several millennia old. Do not wear clothing woven of two kinds of material. Leviticus 1919 Ye shall not round the corners of your heads. Leviticus 1927 All that have not fins and scales in the seas and in the rivers of all that move in the waters and of any living thing which is in the waters they shall be an abomination unto you. Leviticus 910 Thou shalt not boil a kid in its mothers milk. Exodus 2319 When men fight with one another and the wife of the one draws near to rescue her husband from the hand of him who is beating him and puts out her hand and seizes him by the private parts then you shall cut off her hand. Deuteronomy 2511-12 Slaves obey your earthly masters with deep respect and fear. Serve them sincerely as you would serve Christ. Ephesians 65 NLT I could keep going but I think thats a good smattering of examples right there. This is clearly just a very old culture. We dont have slaves anymore. We dont care if clothing is made from two different materials. We dont care about ""rounding the corners of our heads"". I think most people even Christians think its OK to eat fish. And we dont cut off womens hands at a moments notice anymore. Furthermore homosexuals are much more welcomed in society now (though not by all people most notably many religious people). Is it really such a stretch to think that perhaps these people who obeyed these now-seemingly silly customs 2000 years ago also may have invented god in order to gain power? I mean they were pretty primitive. ""Because at the end of the day - if my faith in God was for not and I die and there is no heaven and hell - then thats it. But if there is and the God of this universe is the only One true God - I will enjoy eternity with Him and my other brothers and sisters in Christ and you - eternal death - never ending sorrow and pain."" Again I encourage you to read up on Pascals wager and the issues with the philosophy behind it https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_Wager. Ive already discussed the issues with it at great depth so I wont get back into that. Do you not see how saying Im going to suffer from neverending sorrow and pain might be a bit insulting/personal? Im not claiming that youre going to be tortured for eternity or anything. I have a question separate from how you believe in god and I dont I thought that god loves ALL humans because he created them all right? And Jesus died for our sins because all humans are inherently sinful (which implies that theres a problem inherent in all human beings another thing I take HUGE issue with but I digress). So if god loves me and Jesus died for my sins doesnt it not matter if I believe in god or not? Im still going to go to Heaven. Just to be safe I could not believe in god all my life and then just ask for a pardon for my sins right before I died and Id still get into Heaven right? ""There is nothing I am going to say good or bad defending the Faith or otherwise will keep you from further attacks whether its your intentions or not."" Im not trying to attack the faith. Merely question the grounds it comes from. Thats interesting that that can be interpreted as an attack - just asking questions. Perhaps Christianity would prefer that its followers blindly follow its teachings and give money weekly at mass rather than question its tenets. ""He doesnt need my help in a bantering this way."" I agree God doesnt need help. Because he is fictional.  No worries on typos or grammatical errors. September 21 2015  by  Hope101     Hi CK I just wanted to answer a question you posed in one of your responses. You asked ""I have a question separate from how you believe in god and I dont I thought that god loves ALL humans because he created them all right? And Jesus died for our sins because all humans are inherently sinful (which implies that theres a problem inherent in all human beings another thing I take HUGE issue with but I digress). So if god loves me and Jesus died for my sins doesnt it not matter if I believe in god or not? Im still going to go to Heaven. Just to be safe I could not believe in god all my life and then just ask for a pardon for my sins right before I died and Id still get into Heaven right?"" We believe according to the Bible that yes Jesus died for ALL of our (yours mine everyone elses) sins and that yes God loves you. However the Bible clearly states that unless you come to the Father through believing in the sacrifice that Jesus made on the cross for you truly believing that He died for you truly believing that you need a Savior truly believing that He is the Son of God and put your faith in Him then no you will not go to Heaven anyway when you die. Those who reject Christ do not automatically go to Heaven when they die. So yes Jesus died for you too. But it matters not if you dont receive his sacrifice. If you dont believe that He died for you then He does not know you and you will not be with Him in eternity. Jesus said if you reject Him then you reject His Father who sent Him. The Bible makes it clear that we are all enemies of a Holy God all deserving of hell until we accept Jesus as our Savior. God is loving but God is also just. He is Holy. He is righteous. And just like a just judge on earth much punish crimes and see that justice is served (or he/she wouldnt be fit to be a judge) God is a just God; He is a judge; and He must punish sin. We all have sinned. We all sin sometimes. However we will not all be ultimately punished for our sin. Those of who have accepted the sacrifice that Jesus made for our sins will not be judged for our sins when we die. Jesuss shed blood paid the price for our sin and covers our sin. Those who reject Christ do not have that covering. Jesus died for your too but if you dont care dont believe it dont think any of it is real then you will be held accountable for your sins - a hefty price to pay. Jesus paid for my sins because I could never make it up to a Holy God. Sin offends Him. However the Bible teaches that because He loves us so much He sent Jesus to save us because He does not wish that anyone would perish and die in their sins. He is patiently waiting for more and more to turn to Him. But if you refuse then you refuse. Its your choice. But please do not believe that you will ""get into Heaven"" if you reject Christ. It doesnt work that way. To answer your last question the problem with the idea that ""Just to be safe I could not believe in god all my life and then just ask for a pardon for my sins right before I died and Id still get into Heaven right?"" is that you do not know when you will die. Death could be instantaneous - it is for many people. A horrible car accident that takes your life in a moment. Some people young and old go to bed after having a great day making plans for what they will do tomorrow and never wake up. They dont get a chance to make those plans tomorrow. What if you dont have time to even form that thought? I suppose one day you could unfortunately suffer from a lengthy illness and know that death is near then you would have time to think those things. And if you genuinely cried out to God and ask for forgiveness of your sins and really believed it meant it and accepted Jesus right there as your savior then yes God would absolutely forgive you and you would not go to hell regardless of how you lived your life prior to that moment. But God would know if you were serious and genuine or if you were just saying it as a ""just in case"" formality. He looks at our hearts. If you didnt mean it He wouldnt accept it. I hope this helps. Thanks for asking genuine questions. Reply October 13 2015  by  Shelly     Yes. I can give you an example or as many as you ask for. 1. Most Recent. My friends brother in law was in the hospital with stage 4 Cancer. I went to the hospital with her and prayed laying a hand on his shoulder. I prayed for healing. God heard me and answered. 3 days later the doctors could find no trace of the cancer and he was back to work a week after leaving the hospital. 2. I was going blind with glaucoma. A whole group of people prayed for me. My sight was restored as good as new and all the pain completely went away. Reply September 12 2015  by  John White     Im sorry that you think peoples religious actions even praying out loud and fervently when theyre alone in the house is something you think folks should find funny and neighbors should come out and look confused about. Im sorry that you think this film was unrealistic because it portrayed characters who were ""ham fisted"" in their evangelical witness and not ""subtle."" I suppose you think it more realistic to keep peoples religious beliefs to themselves and only hinted at with metaphor and nuance. But the people in this film really do exist as they are portrayed. And the ""silly"" (as one commenter remarked) and ""unrealistic"" events of the movie are neither silly nor unrealistic. I have experienced all of the things that happen in that movie or seen them actually happen (praying down a mugger causing someone to be unable to do what he wants to through prayer seeing God change peoples hearts within days of praying for Him to do so). One cheating family member of mine turned his life around watching this movie just last week and the wife who had already left him came back home. I have lived with a cheating spouse before so I know the pain. This was a real solid change. This movie is not made to convert non-believers. Its made to inflame those of us who do believe to live what we believe and to pray as we know we should with conviction. Unrealistic? How about a movie in which gasoline is such a scarce commodity that people are willing to die to get it but they waste gasoline wantonly throughout their mad max adventures? Do movies like that get bad reviews for simply being stupid? Reply February 2 2016  by  Amanda     Beautifully written. Reply September 12 2015  by  Max     The last sentence was hilarious Keep up the good work Christy Reply September 12 2015  by  Scott Grimsley     i read your review with interest because you like many folks do not believe in the power of prayer and therefore reject the premise of the movie a priori. This is unfortunate because I think it colors your judgement on the artistic merits of the film. Many critics who celebrate independent films usually thrash on movies made from an explicitly Christian worldview. As a Christian I can appreciate the technical and artistic merit of films even when I disagree with their message. I rarely see the opposite. But that is human nature. I invite you to be more open minded in the future. Reply September 13 2015  by  CK     Isnt it possible the movie was just poorly-made regardless of what one feels about the power of prayer? Reply September 12 2015  by  jozielee     How lovely to see you have so many faithful followers Christy who seem to love this film. Truly enjoyed your review and their response to same.

Reply September 13 2015  by  Lindy Ford     Thank you for your honest review Christy. I agree with you that the movie was hard hitting into the evangelical ballpark. It also think it was a little too neat and tied with a bow at the end-Tony ""magically"" becomes a new man in the span of a week? Really? That rarely happens in real life. I also know that prayer has power because God is real. We think we may not need Him We do every last one of us. Yes Im a Christ follower but I dont check my brains in at the door. I realize the limitations of the movie but the box office is resonating with the fact that people need something bigger than themselves. What Jesus did for us was real and big whether any of us believes it or not.

Written a review based purely on the subject which isnt your cup of tea. Reply September 20 2015  by  CK     Nice straw man argument there. Youre COMPLETELY misconstruing the piece. Did you even read it? The reviewer disliked it because it was a ham-fisted portrayal of faith/prayer not because of the subject matter. You know its possible to dislike a subject matter and SEPARATELY dislike the way the subject matter was portrayed in the story.

I think that if you call a critic a ""libtard"" you show a disturbing hostility to intellectualism. The seething hate of these religious America haters affected me so much that I felt compelled to comment. This movie spreads a false message to impressionable young people simply because prayer has absolutely no power. Just like you cant ""pray the gay away"" you cant pray your way to a better marriage. The best way to have a good marriage is to really find out what a real relationship is. To set a rule for yourself that you cant have sex before marriage is to make the goal of finding a real relationship near impossible. How many christians get married in a fit of sexual tension in their teens or early twenties only to have their marriages fail? The answer is NOT more christianity. God is not some mystical creature in a white chariot who will ride into your life and help you out. Even christians are supposed to know that god helps those who help themselves. I believe that many of the christians who have commented here hate America you can feel it in your heart when they lash out at ""Straight Out of Compton"" or at ""libtard"" critics who have told it like it is and exposed this movie for what it really is a vile piece of propaganda from and for a dying breed of anti intellectual anti-Americans. If you love this movie you hate America. If you are thinking of going to see this movie stay home and watch ""Paris Texas"" on youtube tonight instead that is a beautiful piece of art that will inspire you want to have a good marriage because it shows you how deeply two people can alienate themselves form each other even when the most powerful love exists between them. Dont let a piece of garbage like this haunt your feelings about love and marriage they are the only important things in this life they are your life. Your career is not your life. I find it disgusting that people will set out to make a movie like this that glosses over what love really is and makes it seem as though it can always work out if only you pray. That is truly an ugly and destructive message. Reply October 11 2015  by  IceTea     I have experienced the power of God and prayer in transforming my marriage just recently. I have experience for myself the power of prayer in so many situations. You have not. I am sorry that you have not but for those of us who have had this experience this movie and the topic and details did not seem out of line weird or wacky. They seemed believable and like what we have seen and experience for ourselves. What more can I say? I assume that one who hasnt experienced what I have might think the way you and this reviewer do about the movie. So I get why you dont get it. Reply September 25 2015  by  Suzanne     Let me preface my comment by telling you all that I am a Christian....however I saw the movie last night and I unfortunately agree with most of this review. First off i think its safe to assume that the reviewer is not a Christian. If that be the case she is telling us her honest thoughts on the movie. If we are trying to reach people with this stuff then shouldnt we listen to the way they are viewing or hearing our efforts and to a reasonable extend try to adhere? Or should we be angry dismissive and belittling? When I read something that a non-christian rights that goes against the bible it makes me sad but when I see the responses by ""christians"" that are mean hate filled and non-understanding it makes me angry. And sad. And gives me a sense of defeat. Please get into a church that teaches you how to have grace with other people and that will hold you accountable when youre being a jerk. Okay so the movie...I wish I could say it was great. It just wasnt. I appreciate their zeal for wanting to help others but I think this movie was overbearing. I think it would be a great testimonial to hear about but not a great idea for a while movie that is supposed to be entertaining. Priscilla Shirer was beautiful and I think she did a good job but sometimes I feel so bad for the actors in these movies because I feel they could do better if they didnt have to follow some silly parts in the script. Im sure that this movie motivated some and help some realize their need for Jesus but speaking of defeat I feel a little defeated everytime a Christian movie comes out and I feel like its a flop. Why cant christians make something that seems more authentic? Not so cheesy? As far as some of the criticisms on prayer. First if these people arent Christians and have never prayed and had an answered prayer of course its silly to them. Be understanding of that. At the same time my prayers dont usually get answered right away like that. I was cracking up when the guy ""put down the knife in Jesus name"" Can that happen sure....God can answer that prayer and/or the guy could just be so confused or feel guilty and just run away BUT probably not...thats what screws a lot of people up. They think God is some personal genie and will give you whatever you want when you want it. Say he didnt put the knife down he went through with it and they ended up dead...what then? That stuff happens. Its real. People (including Christians) die every day. Christians all over the world are being killed for their faith...how do you answer that. In America weve warped God into what we want Him to be. When you feel God doesnt come through you are hurt and disillusioned. Afterall how should you feel when a perfect God has failed you? But how can he fail to deliver a promise that he never promised. Please instead of going to movies for your theology read your bibles and get into a church that is solid and reads their bibles. Some people will always think that Christians are stupid crazy or silly but lets try to eliminate all unnecessary ridiculousness and certainly all hatefulness so that they have less reason to think these things and so that maybe we can actually help people and reach them. Why would anyone want to approach and grow close to someone who is mean and belittling? Come on Christians...cut the crap.

Shirer T.C. Stallings Karen Abercrombie; Director Alex Kendrick; Release Date Limited 08/28/2015; Runtime (in minutes) 120; MPAA Rating PG Posted September 11 2015 -- 1232 PM EDT See also How the faith-based drama War Room became a sleeper hit War Room is a gold-plated piece of Bible thumping thats resonating with the same audience that watches Jimmy Stewart get touched by an angel every December in Its a Wonderful Life--and cry next to Christmas trees despite that films many hackneyed religious devices. Directed by Alex Kendrick whos made a series of successful faith-based movies with his brother Stephen out of Georgia over the last decade the movie is explicitly pitched at the 70 percent of Americans who identify as Christians but somehow feel ignored by secular Hollywood. The film preaches to its flock of course insisting over and over that a moral life can only be lived through the grace of Jesus Christ but War Room is definitely not some dreary dorky session of Sunday school. From its very opening moments when we see black female real estate agent confabbing with a mixed race couple in suburban Atlanta--its clear that the film though proselytizing only at itself is at least savvy enough to realize that ""itself"" doesnt necessarily look like Mike Huckabee or Pat Robertson. War Room indeed is both a product and a reflection of 2015 America. Theres no sniveling about a purer time in the country and no coded nostalgia for the past. Despite more people checking the box for religiously unaffiliated than ever before belief in God is still hip enough that Barack Obama speaks continuously as hes done since before he was elected president about the importance of prayer in his life. In the film prayer is exactly what is missing for upper class couple Elizabeth (Priscilla Shirer) and Tony (T.C. Stallings) whose marriage is deteriorating in a morass of arguments over money and his wandering eye. Elizabeth sells the home of a wizened elderly woman named Miss Clara (Karen Abercrombie) who encourages her to ""respect your husband and pray to God to fix him."" A tear-soaked scene in which Elizabeth exorcises Satan from her house serves as the movies ""Ill never be hungry again"" jamboree of classic Georgian ham. The title refers to a closet in Miss Claras home that she has gutted of clothes in favor of Bible verses. And while ""war room"" is an explicit combat metaphor most of the movie is as soft and fluffy as an Easter Bunny. Every note of the plot--from the wisecracking best friend to the music-pumping getting-stuff-done montages--is cribbed directly from the cliche-ridden Hollywood dreck that the movie seems to buck against. And yet the cumulative effect is rather easy to swallow. Perhaps thats because the films protagonist is a woman who talks about being pushed to the back burner in a male-oriented society; or because for all the films mentions of the Christian Lord it ultimately makes a more Jesuitical point about following the Golden Rule. Director Kendrick shows commendable restraint during a late scene in which he appears as Tonys boss at the Big Pharma company he works for--and forgives Tony for a workplace transgression without once bringing up the name of God. The Kendrick brothers sidestep social issues which also seem like an unconscious aping of glossy Hollywood in which pesky little political realties dont exist. A scene in which a knife-wielding attacker drops his weapon because his intended victim invokes the name of Jesus is particularly ludicrous. War Room however does deal with the sin of marital infidelity in a facile 15-minute subplot which is most interesting for being released mere weeks after the hack of spouse-cheating website Ashley Madison. The Bible Belt was revealed to be ripe with Ashley Madison members leading one Louisiana minister to even commit suicide after being exposed. Another Christian blogger and Ashley Madison member from Texas took to YouTube to admit with supportive wife by his side his ""fleshly desires"" that have been ""completely cleansed."" Makes one wonder if the box office success of War Room can be partially attributed to sorry husbands looking for the perfect flick for an atonement date night.

"War Room Review The Kendrick Brothers Latest Christian Hit | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Review War Room Joe Leydon Film Critic joeleydon 72 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr Courtesy of Sony August 30 2015 | 0602PM PT Contrivance and conviction are equally present in the Kendrick brothers latest Christian-themed hit. Yet another faith-based indie that upended the expectations of box office prognosticators by scoring a bountiful opening-weekend gross ""War Room"" is by far the most slickly produced and insistently evangelical movie yet from the sibling team of Alex and Stephen Kendrick. Unlike their previous ""Fireproof"" (2008) and ""Courageous"" (2011) which wove uplifting messages of contrition redemption and transformative Christianity into tales about morally challenged first responders -- firefighters in one police officers in the other -- their new drama is pretty much undiluted prayer rally from beginning to end. The emphatic proselytizing doubtless will resound with ticketbuyers who feel a drama focused on the possibility of spiritual salvation can be every bit as compelling as a spectacle that pivots on the question of whether Loki can pull one over on the Avengers. But it remains to be seen if theres crossover potential for a wide release so bereft of alluring plot hooks for mainstream audiences. Elizabeth Jordan (Priscilla Shirer) an attractive wife mom and real estate agent has grown weary of constantly quarreling with her inattentive husband Tony (T.C. Stallings) a hard-charging frequently traveling pharmaceutical company rep who may have cheating on his mind. But before she can consider a visit to a divorce lawyer she has the good fortune -- or perhaps more accurately the miraculous fortune -- to cross paths with Miss Clara (Karen Abercrombie) a feisty old lady whose Bible-thumping zealousness is so pronounced that even Tyler Perrys perpetually extroverted Madea might find her to be well a bit much. (All the major characters in ""War Room"" are black which may be another reason why some underestimated the movies ability to draw flocks to megaplexes.) Miss Clara is unashamedly and indefatigably curious if not downright nosey and quickly divines that all is not right in Elizabeths life. So she advises the younger woman to pray pray and then pray some more preferably in the seclusion of a closet converted into a spiritual ""war room"" where she can paste Bible verses wish lists and other inspirational material on the wall for easy reference. As Miss Clara sees it -- and Elizabeth soon comes to agree -- Elizabeth should not spend her time dwelling on Tonys many failings as a husband or his neglectfulness as a father to their daughter Danielle (Alena Pitts). Rather she should be fighting alongside not against her errant husband forging an alliance to battle the one responsible for their unhappiness Satan. In the world according to the Kendrick brothers miracles start to happen just as soon as someone starts praying. Indeed sometimes all it takes is a few entreaties to the Lord for a losing high-school football team to begin a victory lap. (Check out 2006s ""Facing the Giants."") In ""War Room"" manifestations of divine intervention are rather more prosaic but every bit as helpful When Tony dines out with a cutie during a business trip and considers her offer of herself as dessert he suddenly is stricken with an upset stomach that requires a hasty rush to the mens room. Cineastes take note This may qualify as the funniest prevention of a close encounter since Doris Day conveniently contracted a nervous rash to disrupt Cary Grants amorous plans in ""That Touch of Mink."" But Tony doesnt start to see the light and share prayer time with his wife until hes fired from his job -- for skimming samples and then selling the merchandise -- and discovers much to his surprise and shame that Elizabeth will continue to stand by him. (Spoiler ahead.) One thing leads to another for what seems like a much longer time than it should and everything leads to a climactic double-dutch jumprope tournament where a team led by Tony and Danielle claims a trophy. No really Thats what happens. Its easy to laugh at the arrant contrivances and heavy-handed dialogue in the script penned by Alex and Stephen Kendrick. But its even easier to admire the persuasive sincerity and emotional potency of the lead performances by Shirer and Stallings who do not transcend their material so much as imbue it with conviction. As a director Alex Kendrick still has much to learn about pacing -- ""War Room"" could be nearly a half-hour shorter after judicious trimming of repetitive or unnecessary scenes -- but there can be no gainsaying his ability to bring sufficient power and credibility to key scenes involving expressions of faith and supplications to God. The production values indicate that the Kendrick brothers continue to raise larger budgets from project to project and more important they know how to spend their money wisely. The soundtrack showcases apt contributions by various Christian recording artists -- most notably Stephen Curtis Chapmans ""Warrior"" the kind of closing-credits theme guaranteed to give audiences a satisfying rush as they leave the theater or turn off their TV.

Lex says May 29 2016 at 1158 am I loved this movie. Ive watched it several times. The actors are good - better than most in Christian films I sadly admit. The script was written as warm and funny and silly (in the best way) but also scripturally accurate. It was a joy to watch. And watch. And watch. I think the reviewer was fair and I am grateful for that. I will say though that I did try to think of a scene(s) I would have edited out but I couldnt think of any. The two hours flew by for me. I would also mention that the strategy for deeper more meaningful prayer (for ANY purpose) is invaluable. The talented Kendrick Brothers are filling a real void with their movies and I am so thankful to God that they have been called to do so. Reply Scott says May 17 2016 at 521 pm I love this movie as well as every single one of their other movies theyre awesome. I really hope they keep making more. Reply Antonia Ntung says April 30 2016 at 840 am The first time I watched the movie was in the month of March just before Easter 2016.Infact it did strengthen my faith and taught me the power of prayer.Honestlythis movie helped me to change the way I perceived my husband.Now I pray more for him than complaining.I have learnt to wage a war against Satan privately and not against my husband.I have deceased from seeing my husband as a problem even in most difficult times but the devil.praise God Reply Rose says March 29 2016 at 741 pm This movie has a powerful message. Its so true about who the enemy is (the Devil). Its easy to see people differently now especially when you know whose working behind the face you see. Thats why Jesus Christ said to Peter ""Get thee behind me Satan"". Jesus knew that what Peter had just said to him was really coming from what Satan (the Devil) had put into his thoughts. Reply Fikiswa says March 26 2016 at 1142 am I have just watched this movie from our movie rental pay chanel on tv in South Africa. The first time I was balling my eyes out and I had to watch it again now with pen and my journal. It came at the right time when I was beginning to examine my walk with God. I knew my prayer life was mediocre but I just didnt know how to change it. For me this movie is a prayer being answerd I now know exactly how to change from this luke warm status to being Hot and I am challenged I am excited. God to bless these brothers with abundant finances to continue spreading the good news. I plan to find and buy dvds for me and every household in my extended family. I JUST CANT KEEP THIS SECRET OF LIFE TO MYSELF Reply John Dough says January 25 2016 at 642 am ...a climactic double-dutch jump rope tournament where a team led by Tony and Danielle claims a trophy. Yea but its only second place not first so see not everything you pray for happens exactly like you want.... Reply Old Redneck says December 30 2015 at 908 pm I watched ""War Room"" twice in one sitting The first time and the last time. Its contrived nonsense. But hey if it makes you feel good to talk to yourself and call it ""prayer"" knock yourself out. Reply Eric Holland says November 2 2015 at 457 pm This was what I needed to see. Im very thankful to have gotten the chance to enjoy this film. Reply Tony says October 14 2015 at 910 pm Great job Kendricks and team I think the positive reviews by audiences say what needs to be said. Keep going Reply Sal U. Lloyd says October 11 2015 at 1019 pm So the movie does a good job of preaching (pun intended) to the choir but could hardly win over a skeptic with its ""message."" The main problem here is that the Kendricks dont know how to deliver a message without hitting you over the head with it. You deliver the message through your story not by speechifying. It wasnt long into the movie that I wanted to strangle Miss Clara Reply B Me says October 7 2015 at 904 am Prayer alongside faith works Years ago my husband and I had a very tumultuous relationship. We were screaming and fighting to the top of our lungs. We had 2 children that were so scared when we both occupied the same space because they knew me and husband were not on the same page at all. I knew God but forgot about dropping my guns(my tongue) that were pointed towards my husband. I changed my focus and said if God cant help us no one can. I took my bible pulled some scriptures on love marriage respect etc and spent my time fighting for my family through prayer. My choice prayer room was my closet. That was 18 years ago. Because of prayer our family is healthy loving and enjoying life. Forgiveness is the key and allowing God to help you. Prayer is a conduit between earthly needs to spiritual assistance. It works and has worked for many many centuries and for many many people. God is the Creator or the Manufacturer of man. He created us. So just like any other created thing you go to the manufacturer or their instruction manual to see how to fix it. God created us so its befitting to go to him when we need help. This film reminds us that we dont have to go at it alone. There is help. Im not a fan of some of the acting but I most certainly got the message and that message was dead on. I had a war room and didnt even know it. But in that space I found instructions solace peace inspiration AND through faith our marriage has been a wonderful testimony to many people. Watch the Movie. It will inspire you. Reply Larry says October 5 2015 at 956 am Thank you so much Kendrick Bros. for producing another fabulous Christian film It is so refreshing and inspirational to see a good movie with no vulgar murder porno blood and guts and I also noticed no body piercings and huge tattoos Thank you again I believe that the true American sincerely hungers for this type of clean entertainment I pray that honestly integrity and cleanliness that you have illustrated will somehow be contagious in this country God knows we need more of yall God Bless America Like it or leave it Reply Carol says September 27 2015 at 657 pm I Dont know how these films are actually making it Maybe its because people are sick and their marriages are rotting and their families are falling apart and there is hope somewhere. No they are not the most professionally made but they are getting better and better and I found myself crying at every one of them and so did everyone around me. I Love well done art. I felt ""War room"" was getting there. I personally have seen the miracles God can do to a family a family and I hope that the Kendrick keep giving hope to a scared and hopeless world because it is real. Quit being so cynical you do not have all of the answers. Reply Cheryl Bauman says September 26 2015 at 1259 am I have watched all the Kendricks brothers Movies and I have really liked them all I am very proud of them for how far they have come. The diligent will rule the world I pray a lot. I believe in the power of prayer but this movie motivates me to Create my own war prayer room I am also amazed that 2 brothers that live no where near Hollywood that started by using only their own church congregation for actors.. It is truly a miracle and a testimony to God and their faith That they are getting their movies into theatres across the country Awesome Way to go Reply browningonphasedarray says September 20 2015 at 258 pm Thank you for the ""fair"" and seemingly impartial review of ""War Room"". I think you gain much credibility by not coming off like someone who finds anything to do with Christianity repugnant. Thats how I feel about 100% of the negative reviews Ive read of a movie everyone I know thoroughly enjoyed. In fact Ive read nearly every review I can find and yours is the only one I can agree with at all. Keep up the good work. Reply brittany says September 18 2015 at 323 am Why does it matter if the cast was all black it was a great movie and prayer and God is the backbone of most elder black women that is what made it so powerful. Her wisdom experience and knowledgeknowledge. Reply Diana Kelley-Hess says September 17 2015 at 459 am I went to see the movie last week was I disappointed that I went? No I would have liked to seen it again but tonight I believe is the last night of it showing where I live. This movie is one of the best Christian movies I have seen in a long time it deserves the best rating that a movie can get. I thank the two brothers who are responsible for making of the film. Thank you and God bless you for taking the veil off of a lot of peoples eyes when it comes to prayer and how powerful prayer really is. We are in a spiritual warfare and our battles have to be won in the spirit before we can win them in the flesh. This story was kept in line with the bible. The Movie about Noah and the Ark I walked right out of it was a disgrace for me to watch it. It was like watching a Sci-Fi movie. My wish is that the churchs today would get back to the basics and preach and teach what the bible says and quit trying to please everyone. We are living in perilous times just like the bible said it would be before Jesus comes back. Things are not going to get better any time soon. We will all need to spend more time in our own War Room. God bless Reply Mary says September 14 2015 at 149 pm Who cares if all the actors are black color is not the message the message is about forgiving and allowing God to work in our failing nature and if we allow God in our daily lifes this can be prevented but if we fail we can bring reconciliation through Jesus Christ and thats what Jesus provides for the whole world even the critics its understandable that good critics can help improve things but the critics need to be better in veiwing and giving the correct critiisicm. Most movies you see more white than anything and then they have one or two blacks have you critize that if so i would love to see the history and by the way i am white. A good critic would focus on message not color and all the whites that are not prejudious will see the movie because God is no respect of person . Christians see no color they see the spirit of the living God. Keep being a witness in the gift that God has giving you its done to the Glory of God and thanks for promoting wonderful movies that we can look at without being seduced the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life. Reply Eva says June 28 2016 at 830 am Oh I so wish that we could do things without always mentioning color. I think sometimes we forget GOD loves everyone. If we could only remember that. I think the message here is how powerful prayer is. Father GOD I pray that we remember that. Reply Mike Strickland says September 14 2015 at 543 pm My wife amd I saw War Room today for the second time We are both certain that this is the best movie we have EVER seen Were both 69 years old so we have seen a LOT of movies Mary is absolutely right Christians today dont pay attention to skin color. We are interested in what God is saying to us through the characters. We all need to take the message of War Room to heart and make prayer our first priority in life. Wonderful movie Reply Sal U. Lloyd says October 11 2015 at 1021 pm If this is the best movie you have ever seen you havent seen many. Don says September 13 2015 at 839 pm I really appreciate the way you did your best to give the movie an honest and fair review. Keep up the good work Mr. Leydon. I look forward to many future movie critiques. Reply Cynthia Graham says September 13 2015 at 352 pm Personally I felt the movie was long but once I sat down I could not believe my attention was challenged every moment. The storyline was done brilliantly; if one didnt believe in prayer when they walked out of the theater after watching this film they definitely had a new prayer formula. Awesome job and a must go see type of movie. Author Cynthia Graham Ward of When Things Change Reply Lindsey says September 13 2015 at 1021 am Loved the movie. I was raised a Christian but dont go to church and consider myself agnostic. After seeing the movie Im inspired to give Christianity another try. Reply Jennifer Rae Nickeson says October 19 2015 at 309 pm Whoa That is awesome You just brought tears to my eyes. Im excited for you. I encourage you to think of it as ""give Jesus another try"" rather than Christianity. Religions can and do hurt people and let people down. I firmly believe that Jesus never will. lt;3 Reply Sonja says September 13 2015 at 1005 am I loved this movie and I am NOT a BIBLE THUMPER Reply Marilyn Vandekieft says September 12 2015 at 720 pm I had to see this movie twice and I may make a third visit...or buy the DVD when its available. It is an awesome powerful movie awakening every viewer to the importance and power of prayer. Im not married now and Im 76 years old but I realize that if I had employed prayer as shown in this film my marriage could have survived. ""War Room"" made me sadly aware of how puny my prayer life is and that is going to change drastically And if it does the same for every viewer there is hope for our country...hope that Gods power will heal marriages and family relationships return this country to the moral patriotic God-fearing God-led nation it once was and move churches to focus on Gods Word sin repentance and salvation instead of on how many flavors of coffee to offer at the coffee bar and succumbing to worldly methods to increase their numbers God forgive us for our pride and self-reliance...You are worthy of all praise honor and glory Change us through our prayer life and draw us closer to You as we call upon You through prayer in every phase of our lives. Reply aaronsmom says September 9 2015 at 759 am The average viewer is not going to see this movie. Those who see this already have a similar mindset as the movie makers do. Reply Jennifer Rae Nickeson says October 19 2015 at 312 pm I thought the same thing but I see at least one commenter here than identifies herself as agnostic...and all of the reviewers...may be small but its a start. ) Reply Autumn says September 8 2015 at 255 pm The most inspirational movie I have seen in s long time. This is a good family friendly movie with a wonderful message of faith putting others first and forgiveness. Five stars from me Reply carolyn robinson says September 8 2015 at 412 am My husband and I saw War Room yesterday. It was recommended to us by two young friends. We are in our late 60s. How refreshing to watch something not vulgar violent or with nudity. You could take your 10 year old or your 80 year old mother to see it and not be ashamed. There were plenty of tears from women in the audience because it resonates with what so many marriages are going through today. I highly recommend this movie. Reply Stella says September 7 2015 at 830 pm I saw War Room today and liked it very much. I recommended this movie to all my friends and family This movie is a must see Family friendly inspiring story about hope and the power of prayer Dont believe the negative propaganda It is so sad that these days people call what is good bad and what is evil good( Reply Melissa says September 7 2015 at 812 pm This movie was great I took my 14 amp;11 year old boys and they enjoyed it. My 11 year old asked if we could stop by target to get him a light so he could create his own ""war room"". To have a movie inspire generations is what America needs. Reply Jennifer Rae Nickeson says October 19 2015 at 314 pm That is SO so exciting I know this is awful but I imagined adults of all ages getting inspired by this but didnt even dream of kids being inspired to start their own war rooms too (I know duh). ) Praise God Reply Steven says September 7 2015 at 809 pm I saw all the negative critic reviews for war room just prior to seeing it. I was completely dumbfounded by the quality the acting skill and the deep message relayed by this movie. I feel like these negative critics were looking for gratuitous sex and mindless violence in order to post a good review. Since there is none they tried to attack the movie on technical grounds-Dont listen to the negative critics go see the movie and youll be glad you did Reply Loved It says September 7 2015 at 225 pm Saw it and will go see it a 2nd time. Reply Brandy says September 7 2015 at 540 am Great Great Great Movie Must see Reply Tan says September 6 2015 at 547 pm I love thinking about the moment when these liberal critics go to check on gross sales and ranking at the Top Box office just to realiz that the movie they so desperately tried to harm is today the number one with over 25 million in sales (as of today). Mr Leydon unfortunately for you America continues to be a God loving and fearing nation no matter how many good reviews you give to the typical liberal and godless movies that you love. At least we know you are consistent Reply aaronsmom says September 9 2015 at 757 am You make it sound like Christians cant be liberal. Reply David says September 6 2015 at 327 pm Another critic spewing negativity from a spiritual experience. I pray that someday they will have their hearts softened to be freed from the pain and suffering that they are obviously experiencing. Reply Eric M. Blake says September 11 2015 at 302 pm This is actually a positive review. He isnt ""spewing negativity"". Christians moviegoers have to learn to recognize constructive criticism for what it is. The Kendrick Bros. movies so far have been good. We can still do a lot better. Reply Patsy says September 6 2015 at 231 pm Either you will connect with the movie and see the truth of Gods Word exposed or you will have no clue what this movie was about. Truly our world country communities families and believers have lost their understanding of what it means to experience the salvation of Jesus Christ. Jesus died that we might live the abundant life. This movie illustrated what goes on in the majority of ""Christian"" homes. Millions of couples attend church on Sunday but return home to argue fight and live separate lives. Then they wonder why their children turn away from the faith. War Room recaptures what it means to be a Christian - bringing oneself and all that belongs to them under the authority and leadership of Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior and renouncing Satan and his power over their life. 1. Salvation is a personal experience. Elizabeth did not bash her husband but she did submit her husband to God praying that God would work in his life. She did come under Gods authority and allowed Him to work in her life to resolve her anger and unforgiveness. If we want God to change our marriages he will begin in ""us"" first. 2. Going to Church does not equate living the Christian life Millions sit on pews each Sunday to go home to live as they want on Monday - Saturday. Our belief and faith in Jesus will affect all area of our lives. True worship is a life lived in holy sacrifice to God. 3. ""Victories do not come by accident."" So often we want God to zap us with his all powerful wand. Not only are we to submit to God but we must resist Satan. We must be intentional about winning our battles whether in the mind or in reality. Understanding the real enemy is key to winning the battle. Satan is the enemy. 4. ""Theres no room for you and God on the throne of your heart."" Either we are on the throne or allow Jesus as Lord of our lives but not both. We have a choice to allow God to fight our battle or we can take control thus facing the consequences of our own actions. 5. Prayer is powerful to solve a mountain of problems. A prayer life will change you your marriage and your ministry and your outlook on life. When is the last time you got on your knees in the closet and wept over a loved one? (I am working on my own War Room) 6. We have a responsibility to mentor others in their journey. Love is tough. Even if you are seen as a ""busy body"" it is worth the risk to save someones life their marriage or better yet their soul. We take risk to speak about other topics and issues. If we have experienced the grace of Jesus we are responsible to share it with others. ""Lord bring me one that I can mentor along the way."" I could go on and on with my opinion of the movie and the lessons I learned but God will speak to you in a different way. Reply Jo Ann Eady says September 6 2015 at 1252 pm The War Room is the most powerful anointed film I have ever seen in my life. The anointing on the film was mighty that it took us to church and face to face with the presence of God. I look around and saw many people crying and applauding throughout the movie. It touch the very soul of all that was present. It was more than Hollywood. May God continue to bless you richly Jo Ann Reply Nita says September 9 2015 at 1133 am Jo Ann Eady... I totally agree with you the anointing on that film was so prevalent in the room so much so that you could not leave there not feeling touched I cried I prayed I clapped I Amend LOL I LOVE IT and went home and made my own war room and felt good about it I can only speak of my own upbringing but that is the way it was in my own household as we get older we tend to change and lose somethings in our upbringing and tend to do things our own way sometimes we tend to get lost in that I loved this movie for the memories it brought back for me and the renewed feelings of God in my life it brought me....definitely going to see it again and again I never listen to critics because they are not me and they will not see what I see it is just their opinion. Reply Odessa Fowler says September 2 2015 at 843 am War Room There are no words to describe how much we needed to be reminded of how precious our lives are when we are joined together as ""ONE"" with prayer as our middle ground. Thank you for bringing such to the fore-front -- a much need in these trying times of Marriages etc. NOW I am patiently waiting for WW-II (War-Room II) that will properly address the ""SINGLE AND SAVE"" (for real) LOL. GOD BLESS - AND HOPE ALL of us get the message - Pray your way through will get you through any thing -- focus on whos you are and not what you are Reply Sally says September 13 2015 at 1029 pm My dear I so agree with ALL THESE POSITIVE MOVIE my husband and i went to see this movie after today after church . We have been married for 21 years blessed with a beautiful daughter .Been a christian for so many years but this movie tuely renewed my faith In God and hope in our marriege.every one was crying in the movie theatre. How great GOD is how refreshing to see a movie like this America we need inspiring movies like this. i will see this movie again and again  and what is touching is not even 1 famous actor  Elizabeth in the movie is Priscilla Shirer and she is a writter and a pastor and i have read a few of her books and she has preached at our church a few times.Was taken aback when i saw her but she was soooo amazing in the film. She was effortlessThis deserves an oscar. We see all this violent movies with nudity  negative messages and finaly THIS. God BLESS US ALL GOD BLESS AMERICA Reply Burt Wizeman says September 2 2015 at 533 am My wife my daughter (13) and I saw this movie last night. We laughed aloud cried asall the extents of emotions are drawn out with this wonderful movie except lust and hate. My 13 year old daughter said that it was ""inspiring"" . From my 13 year old Thank you to the makers and produers of this grand flick. Hollywood we are tired of sex and violence. This movie is Straight Out Of Scripture. By the way white people like black people in movies. We think they are cool. Reply Janis L. Bohyer says September 1 2015 at 556 pm Wow this was an amazing movie from beginning to end. The story line acting-even little Alena did an a wonderful job. My husband and I had many tears through this film and we know the truth that there is a spiritual enemey that wants to destroy our marriages and our families. Prayer really unleashes God power to work in us. Thank you Kendrick brothers and all who participated in making such a great movie We loved it Reply louise s. says September 1 2015 at 907 am Eight of us saw War Room Sunday night and we loved it. My grandson 14 and granddaughter 7 were captivated from beginning to end. It was beautiful and the acting was great. It is real and God was and is with the Kendrick brothers. People applauded at the end and I cried tears of joy throughout the whole movie . Saved orunsaved  please see it. You wont regret it. Reply samiamhis says September 1 2015 at 603 am I saw the movie on Monday and I agree with the majority of reviews on this site. Outstanding I laughed and cried throughout the film. The Kendrick brothers continue to improve in their scripting casting and bold advances in the arena of evangelical movies. Many movies are faith based but unclear as to the end goal. The Kendricks never miss a beat to point the way to Jesus. Too often I think I am the one who needs to bring change in the lives of others. It colors how I pray and why I pray. I was inspired by the timeless truths that I must humble myself before His mighty throne and that the battle is the Lords Reply wordmpress says August 31 2015 at 742 pm America is so thirsty for wholesome pro-family pro-God inspirational entertainment. Just look as the success of Duck Dynasty and movies like War Room. IMHO we all have an inherent knowledge of God and choosing to search for truth (in faith) in much harder than giving into self and selfish desires. I say this as someone who doesnt go to church and who has lived a life of sin. However I am a Christian and know the reality of spiritual warfare. I know the evil that exists in this world and I know the occult influence that consumes Hollywood. I hope and pray that we as people come out of this modern day Babylon we are living in and turn towards God for redemption Reply Theo hogan says August 31 2015 at 1017 am I saw this movie last night and it was exceptional....in the message.....the acting. I highly recommend it to give hope for some new strategies on dealing with life. One of the best movies Ive eever seen. Unlike the box office hit Trainwreck that shows someone coping with life with drugs alcohol free sex a comedy.....I dont think so....a disaster In War Room there was laughter applause and hopeful answers to life. Reply Beth C. Pfohl says August 31 2015 at 1002 am Congratulations to the Kendrick brothers. They are not just executing the old adage ""If you build it they will come."" they are also building on their previous success via their faith and conviction. And (cynically) if its one thing that Hollywood understands its money. The secular critics and film going public are free to turn their noses up and/or sneer as they see fit. But there are others who will find this film hits a chord in a way that speaks to their hearts. And if people come out of the theatre uplifted and committed to an area of their life that may have been given short shrift whats wrong with that? I dont know any filmaker who doesnt want some kind of positive feedback no matter what the genre. Reply Tom BT says August 31 2015 at 943 am I too loved this film and watched it Saturday in a near full theatre. I am so glad to finally see quality Christian films produced that are not cheesy and poorly done. This is a first rate film for people of faith. I dont expect others to enjoy or even understand it. The theatre on Saturday was very diverse and at the end of the film the crowd erupted in spontaneous applause. This film is funny entertaining and imparts an important message the Christian community needs to hear right now. As society descends into darkness Gods light will burn all the brighter and we are seeing that light in a number of quality movies coming out of the Christian community. It is a must see Reply Sheila says August 31 2015 at 937 am Out of a 5-star review I give it a 10+. This is the best movie I have ever seen I wanted to pay and watch it again literally did not want to leave the theater. It was that great This movie has changed my life to want to be stronger than ever just like Ms. Clara. It was such a clean funny uplifting and empowering movie. I would love to see many more like this and plan to see this one as many times as I can. Reply Mike Strickland says August 31 2015 at 804 am War Room is the most Important movie for Christians and our nation to come out in my (69 years) lifetime If Christians will truly take the message of this movie to heart their lives will be changed in the best way possible. Becoming prayer warriors and letting God change things will change the way Christians are perceived. Our nation has told God that we dont want Him in our loves. Through prayermwe can invite Him back in to our nation Reply Song byrd says September 27 2015 at 411 pm I saw the movie with my church family. Loved it. A teen was sitting next to me and quoting the scripture along with the wise women. I thank God that it was a movie that inspired every one young and old. That night and into the wee hours of the morning I prayed for every one. I find my self in a thankful place where ever I am. I am friendlier I say thank you more in stores and wishing people a good day. My heart is full of thanksgiving and praise. And then the Pope came to the United States. Wake up Maybe God is trying to tell us something. Not perfect still trying to be a better me. I plan to go see the movie again. I really enjoyed it Do not have one prayer room. I pray all over my house God is and so I am Reply Bill B. says August 31 2015 at 737 am Uh no thanks. Reply Lj says August 31 2015 at 442 am The first mature Christian film I can recall. It is an adult Christian experience. Fantastic Reply Raz says August 31 2015 at 429 am Wow just wow and not in a good way this movie was reviewed. The reviewer obviously didnt get the message of the film and prolly never will. Reply Sal U. Lloyd says August 30 2015 at 848 pm Not that I endorse this movie which I havent seen but where are the snarky atheist comments??? Reply Lonnie Corbin says August 31 2015 at 424 am Refreshing to see a Christian movie objectively reviewed.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet War Room is the fifth film by director Alex Kendrick and his brother and regular collaborator Stephen and their first since 2011s Courageous. All four of their previous movies have been fabulously profitable but in the Kendricks absence an increasing number of theatrically released Evangelical productions have overcrowded the market making each such release less of a fiscal sure thing. The Kendricks have chosen smartly in making War Room their first film with a predominantly black cast a deliberate attempt to draw in a seriously underserved part of the Evangelical audience. Like Courageous and its Kirk-Cameron-versus-pornography predecessor Fireproof War Room is about a marriage on the verge of implosion thats saved by a renewed intensified commitment to Christian faith. Specifically War Room advocates the practice of becoming a ""prayer warrior"" i.e. praying to God on behalf of oneself and others to accomplish specific goals. Unhappy in her marriage to pharmaceutical sales rep Tony (T.C. Stallings whose muscly can-do charisma makes clear why hes on the motivational-speaker circuit) real-estate agent Elizabeth (Priscilla Shirer) finds an unexpected mentor in elderly Clara (Karen Abercrombie) whos looking to sell her house. After dropping a ham-handed hint of her marital troubles Elizabeth is given a good haranguing about her lukewarm relationship to God and exhorted to try harder. ""I see in you a warrior that needs to be awakened"" Clara says as the music swells dramatically. What Elizabeth apparently needs is a quiet space where she can ask God to help her husband stop being a work-obsessed jerk; the responsibility for that change is on her via The Lord when asked properly. Clara operates out of an empty closet with hand-written goals and scriptural citations taped to the wall to help her plan and execute her prayers so Elizabeth follows her example resulting in an unprecedented number of shots of people staring at closets in awe. (The other regularly recurring feature jokes about how much Elizabeths feet smell.) Her first prayer monologue is fiery enough--culminating with her standing on the porch telling Satan to back off without apparent regard for what the neighbors might think of somebody yelling into the suburban night air about the devil. But much of what follows is turgid and for non-believers ridiculous a series of religious homilies that are both oddly specific and totally vague about the larger theology underpinning the prayer-warrior concept presuming (correctly) that the target audience is already familiar with it. Because of its specific focus War Room doesnt have the scattershot polemic agenda of fundamentalist beliefs to affirm that many other faith-based films do. The secondary emphases are on the importance of wifely submission in the midst of marital difficulty the unthinkability of divorce the desirability of children addressing their father as ""sir"" and--in an aside establishing Clara as a nice proper lady --that its a shame so many young people these days have ""sloppy hair and pants around their knees."" The film is predictably shameless about cloaking itself in virtue setting Claras list of answered prayers next to a photo of MLK on her wall. The Kendricks are almost certainly sincere (if their request for warriors to pray for them throughout production is any indication) as is their cast; Shirer is a ministry founder the daughter of a pastor a public speaker and religious writer who has a book coming out tied in to the film. To be fair the Kendricks are technically semi-competent favoring basic handheld close-ups of people talking through lengthy scenes. Theres the occasionally bewildering editorial effect Elizabeths first prayer is covered from a camera to her left and one head-on intercutting between the two angles with no evident relation to the monologues internal momentum. At least the film allows its characters to not be on-message about God all the time and even has room for people who arent required to proclaim their faith (or be berated for their lack thereof). Still its structurally listless and unimaginative including a typical guys-talking-on-the-basketball-court of the type definitively skewered in They Came Together.Its innocuous enough fare though its creepy to encourage women to believe the true source of their husbandly woes is Satan rather than an issue that probably needs to be discussed. Claras climactic monologue--oddly and unintentionally reminiscent of the people-come-together climax of Tomorrowland--exhorts us to be a nation of warriors showing demographically balanced multi-cultural groups of people praying at the flagpole in a police station locker room and in front of a map nailed to the wall somewhere or other. This includes a pointed shot of the White House which is as political as the film gets. Nonetheless its unnerving that the cast is so into their product that in a recent promotional interview Stallings said he thought the film was a potential cure for the recent especially prominent wave of racial tension in the wake of shootings police brutality etc. ""Racial tension is dangerous and people are dying and a lot of us want to see that stopped"" he explained. ""This movie will give people a way to take these problems to the Lord and show them that prayer is the best way to fight back."" Simply put Thats not helpful.

TWITTER The latest faith-based drama from the Kendrick brothers concerns a couple whose troubled marriage is healed by prayer. With such box-office successes as Facing the Giants Fireproof and Courageous to their credit theres no denying that the Kendrick brothers have tapped into a deep market for faith-based films. Their latest effort War Room doesnt stray far from their well-established template and should well succeed in attracting their literally faithful audiences although its heavy-handed proselytizing and soap opera-ish storytelling will prove a turn-off to those who dont pray on a daily basis. Indeed prayer is the main theme of the plot which involves the troubled marriage between real-estate broker Elizabeth (Priscilla C. Shirer a prominent Christian speaker and author making her film debut) and Tony (T.C. Stallings) a successful pharmaceutical rep. Tony so bulked-up that he appears to be dipping into his companys steroids has little use for his wife telling a friend ""Im just tired of her"" and pays little attention to the couples adorable 10-year-old daughter Danielle (Alena Pitts). Increasingly distraught over her husbands emotional abuse Elizabeth finds her life changed when she meets her latest client Miss Clara (Karen Abercrombie) an elderly widow who advises her that the only way she can mend her husbands errant ways is by praying to God for help. And casual prayer isnt enough; this must be focused fervent prayer offered on high from the right venue. What Elizabeth must do as Miss Clara did is set up a ""war room"" which in Elizabeths case is her clothes closet formerly the scene of her secret binge eating of potato chips. Read More Box Office Christian Drama War Room Opens to 600K Thursday Night Tony meanwhile engages in a not-so-secret flirtation with a co-worker that seems poised to launch into an affair and is ultimately revealed to be stealing from his employers. It isnt hard to guess that by the films end hell have learned the errors of his ways thanks to his wifes newfound religiosity. Its not so much the plot or themes of the film thats the problem as the ham-fisted execution. Unintentional comic moments abound such as when Elizabeth and Miss Clara are accosted by a knife-wielding mugger and the elderly woman refuses his demand for money telling the assailant to put down his knife ""in the name of Jesus"" which he promptly does. Folks this is not a good strategy in real life. Then theres the scene in which Elizabeth after a heartfelt address to God suddenly turns her wrath on Satan stepping outside of her home and shouting ""This house is under new management"" Or the tired running gag about her smelly feet which at least has a thematic payoff with a climactic not so subtly symbolic scene in which her reformed husband lovingly washes them. Or the left field moment in which Tony having become ill during a romantic dinner with his would-be lover apparently becomes convinced that Elizabeth is poisoning him and secretly switches their dinner plates. Read More Honorary Oscar Recipient Spike Lee Also a Frequent Critic of the Academy Endlessly stopping the action such as it is with deadly earnest sermons most of them delivered in fiery fashion by Miss Clara the screenplay by director Alex Kendrick and his brother Stephen never misses an opportunity to pound home its message. Tonys reform -- which includes confessing to his employees that hes stolen drug samples worth thousands of dollars and volunteering to take part in his daughters double-dutch competition -- is so sudden and extreme that it makes Scrooges transformation look subtle by comparison. The film has a solidly professional visual sheen and the performances are largely effective with Abercrombie particularly enjoyable as the feisty oldster. But for all its good intentions War Room like so many films of its ilk is strictly preaching to the choir. Production FaithStep Films Affirm Films Red Sky Studios TriStar Pictures Cast Priscilla C.

EntertainmentMovies War Room Preaching halts flow of faith-based story Originally published August 28 2015 at 1205 am Updated August 27 2015 at 109 pm Movie review of ""War Room"" This engaging entry in the faith-based genre has fiery convictions that make it interesting but it also has long speeches about Jesus and Satan that stop the story all together. Rating 2.5 stars out of 4. Share story By Tom KeoghSpecial to The Seattle Times A Christian faith-based drama with fire good performances and a nice luster to its look and feel ""War Room"" is an engaging film that derails itself only when the story occasionally stops for protracted preaching. Anchored by strong acting and assured if unremarkable direction ""War Room"" finds real-estate agent wife and mom Elizabeth (Priscilla C. Shirer) feeling alienated from her husband Tony (T.C. Stallings) a traveling salesman with a chip on his shoulder and a wandering eye for other ladies. When Elizabeth gets the listing on a house owned by feisty widow Miss Clara (Karen Abercrombie) she finds herself on the receiving end of the voluble seniors accrued wisdom about turning ones life over to Jesus. Whats interesting about ""War Room"" is that Clara isnt speaking in platitudes but rather with the intensity of a warrior cultivating a fighting passion in Elizabeth. Movie Review 1/2   War Room with Priscilla C. Shirer T.C. Stallings Karen Abercrombie. Directed by Alex Kendrick from a screenplay by Alex and Stephen Kendrick. 120 minutes. Rated PG for thematic elements. Several theaters. The need Clara says is not to expect Tony to change but to get out of the way of the grace required to see he can be a better man.

When Elizabeth stands on her front lawn loudly warning an unseen devil to stay away from her home ""War Room"" becomes the sum of feverish convictions. By contrast Claras speeches go on far too long unnecessarily halting action. This is a general problem in the faith-based genre stopping a movie to make a point.
