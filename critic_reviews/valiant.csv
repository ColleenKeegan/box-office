British computer-animation house Vanguard redresses the balance by giving our feathered heroes their due with this entertaining CGI family flick about a wood pigeon who despite his diminutive size manages to con his way into the elite Royal Homing Pigeon Service (RHPS) a wing of the military responsible for delivering important messages from the French Resistance to the Allies. Valiant and his new flock of friends have hardly finished pre-flight training when news comes in of another failed RHPS attempt to get past the Nazis Channel-based falcon squad. Can the audacious Valiant his heroic leader Gutsy and the rest arrive safely in France meet the Resistance (a gang of field mice) and return without losing their feathers? Not if General Von Talon head of the pigeon-fancying falcons has anything to do with it. This may be the first that the latest generation will have seen or heard of the war so you could say theres a modicum of educational value in it albeit of the cute anthropomorphic sort. (Sounds like pigeon-fanciers anti-peregrine-falcon propaganda to me - Senior Film Ed.) Its funny too and well voiced by a cast that includes Ewan McGregor (in a second CGI role alongside Robots) Ricky Gervais John Cleese (obviously) and John Hurt. What surprises most though is the quality of the visuals which if not in the Robots league are commendably lush and lively.

"Valiant | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; valiant ) Valiant (United Kingdom 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli Valiant is for the birds. Arguably the blandest of the burgeoning crop of big budget digitally animated films Valiant aims to prove that the death of traditional animation has simply pushed lackluster screenplays into the digital realm. Until recently digital animation had been heads-and-shoulders about its longer-lived counterpart because each film was lovingly crafted with an attention to detail. Over the past year however digitally animated films have begun to show an assembly line quality and Valiant represents a new low. Its not as clever as it thinks it is not as funny or exciting as it should be and not as engaging as it needs to be to prevent kids from losing interest and parents from falling asleep. Its 1944 and the Allies are preparing for D-Day. Valiant (voice of Ewan McGregor) is an undersized pigeon who wants to join the Royal Carrier Pigeon Force and ferry messages back and forth between England and the French Resistance. With Germanys dangerous falcon Von Talon (Tim Curry) frequently downing pigeons the corps cant afford to be picky about its recruits so unlikely candidates such as Valiant and his scruffy friend Bugsy (Ricky Gervais) are allowed to sign up. After going through ""boot camp"" under the tutelage of a hard-nosed sergeant (Jim Broadbent) Valiant is sent on a mission to France to rescue a captured courier (John Cleese) and retrieve a crucial message. The missions commander is the revered Gutsy (Hugh Laurie) perhaps the most decorated pigeon. But things go wrong and Valiant and his comrades find themselves trapped behind enemy lines. Its necessary to ask a fundamental question about Valiant. Who is the target audience? The WWII backstory will have no meaning to viewers under 10 and the storyline doesnt offer much for viewers who are older. The film is plodding predictable and uninteresting. Theres nothing fresh or inspired about any aspect of the storytelling. Young kids might be amused by some of the slapstick antics but the humor isnt going to tickle the funny bones of older children or adults. (At the public screening I attended there was virtually no laughter and the auditorium was packed with families.) The action scenes generate little tension or suspense. The voices are provided by an impressive array of names - its a cast worthy of better material. John Cleese Jim Broadbent Ricky Gervais and Hugh Laurie are the only ones whose vocal performances exhibit any gusto. Tim Curry sounds like hes doing an impersonation of Tim the Enchanter from The Holy Grail (odd considering that hes currently appearing in ""Spamalot"" on Broadway). Everyone else including Ewan McGregor and John Hurt sound bored. With this film and Robots on his animated resume its time for McGregor to give up the voice work and return to live-action. The most disappointing thing about Valiant is the pedestrian quality of the animation. Strictly speaking its not bad but after the advances of films like Finding Nemo and The Incredibles this film takes a giant step backwards. At times it has a rough unfinished look. Facial expressions are less flexible than in many other digitally animated films. Backgrounds frequently lack detail. I dont know how long it took to make Valiant; however judging purely by the evidence on the screen it seems to have been put together quickly and cheaply. This is not a strong argument for first-time director Gary Chapman being granted another shot. In a way Valiant is a stopgap for both British animation and Disney (the distributor). Fans of the former are eagerly awaiting the next Wallace and Gromit film which is due out in the fall. And Disney is already stoking up the publicity engine to generate excitement for their first in-house digitally animated project Chicken Little (opens November 4 2005). As for Valiant its limited appeal will likely result in a short box office life. Its sad to realize that the most entertaining portion of the Valiant theater-going experience is watching the 5-minute ""short"" that represents the Ice Age 2 trailer.

"A Military Coo washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies A Military Coo Fly boys On the wing members of Britains Royal Homing Pigeon Service team up with Rollo a mouse whos part of the French Resistance. (Copyright 2005 Disney/vanguard Animation Uk Limited/uk Film Council.) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday August 19 2005 ""What did you think of the movie?"" ""Scawy."" Thats pretty much a verbatim account of a lunchtime conversation with the 3 1/2 -year-old who accompanied this critic to a Saturday-morning preview of ""Valiant"" Disneys last attempt of the summer to entertain the kids before theyre safely warehoused -- er enrolled -- back in school and day care for the fall. Whether kids will thank Disney or feel like theyve been given some early homework however is open to question. ""Valiant"" is a smart marvelously drawn account of the bravery of homing pigeons during World War II when 31 real British birds won the equivalent of the Victoria Cross for outstanding service. Indeed the movie is so faithful to its historical subject that it resembles an animated version of a walk through Londons somber Imperial War Museum; edifying enlightening rather humbling but not what most kids would describe as a lot of wacky end-of-summer fun . At a recent screening young viewers were rapt but the only laughs heard in the audience were the quiet chuckles of parents appreciating the films subtle interstitial humor. Still as long as expectations are properly managed ""Valiant"" will be a tonic compared with some of the fluffier animated films usually offered to kids. The story -- about a tiny wood pigeon named Valiant (voiced by Ewan McGregor) who enlists in the Royal Homing Pigeon Service and finds himself saving the day by going behind enemy lines -- is engrossing even though the finer points of espionage wartime sacrifice and the strategic role of the French Resistance may elude very young viewers. Then there are those ""scawy"" parts which usually involve surprisingly intense battle action and some grim bird-on-bird violence especially when a group of German falcons swoops down on the stout British pigeons with bloodthirsty ferocity. At one point a British bird voiced by John Cleese is taken prisoner in one of the falcons pillboxes which the animators have endowed with deco monumentalism worthy of Albert Speer. ""Ve hef vays of making you squawk"" says Von Talon (Tim Curry) the preening chief falcon. In a typical example of ""Valiants"" knowing humor Von Talons secret weapon is to force his victims to listen to yodeling (a form of torture conveniently left out of the Geneva Conventions). Meanwhile Valiant along with a new friend named Bugsy (Ricky Gervais the brilliant star of BBCs ""The Office"") joins up with the RHPS and the two endure the kind of classic war-movie training that always begins with a commander yelling ""Gentlemen welcome to the . . . ."" Valiant and his -- what else -- ragtag gang of misfits may be the only soldiers who train by flying in and out of the structures at Stonehenge but train they do until theyre unexpectedly called to France. Thats when things become really dodgy They are shot down they barely receive a message from French spies they suffer a falcon attack and they infiltrate Von Talons lair finally returning to Britain with the message -- something about the location of a landing being changed to Normandy. Fans of classic World War II movies will appreciate ""Valiants"" old-school aesthetic and storytelling sense a return to core cinematic values that is made even more classy by a first-rate all-British cast. Whats more first-time director Gary Chapman and his crack team of animators have done a terrific job with the graphics rendering Valiant and his fellow birds with painterly detail right down to the blue green and violet iridescence of their feathers. The artistic team takes similar care with the pigeons world bringing to life such beloved landmarks as Big Ben Trafalgar Square and the white cliffs of Dover. A soundtrack gleaned from 1940s classics and some authentic-looking newsreels (in which cartoon pigeons train and mug just like human soldiers did back in the day) complete a production that for many parents will be a relief from the incessant pop-culture references and Top 40 hits that drive so many of todays animated features. And even though its historical references and battle scenes may fly over their heads like so many homing pigeons kids will enjoy ""Valiant"" too if only for its nonstop action and lively visual design. To pick up that lunchtime conversation where we left off the toddler was asked whether she would want to see ""Valiant"" again. ""Um-hmm"" she said nodding emphatically just before taking a swig of chocolate milk and turning her attention to the hot dog before her. Valiant (76 minutes at area theaters) is rated G.

This review was corrected on Thursday March 31 2005 Lackluster CGI toon ""Valiant"" features an all-avian cast of characters and top-flight British vocal talent to spoof fondly WWII fly-boy dramas like ""The Battle of Britain."" However despite a handful of good aerial ""birdfight"" sequences ""Valiant"" fails to get off the ground due to a by-numbers script and dodo-ugly character design that add up to less than one would expect from ""Shrek"" producer John H. Williams. Thanks to strong marketing in the U.K. pic looked set to soar at the B.O. in its Easter weekend opening there but may lay an egg in the U.S. upon its August 19 release leaving Buena Vista/Disney to feather its nest with ancillary. Based loosely on the fact real-life carrier pigeons played a significant role during WWII the pic plays the classic raw-recruit-becomes-a-hero story arc with a beak-featured cast. Ewan McGregor assaying a second animated gig after ""Robots"" voices young Valiant a patriotic wood pigeon inspired by the heroic exploits of squadron leader Gutsy (Hugh Laurie) to join the Royal Homing Pigeon Service (RHPS). In a curiously empty Trafalgar Square -- pics budget seemingly didnt stretch to animating extras here -- Valiant meets Cockney conbird Bugsy (""The Offices"" Ricky Gervais) who ends up enlisting to evade some thuggish magpies. Dullish midsection sees Valiant and Bugsy going through training under supervision of a hard-ass sergeant (Jim Broadbent). The lads feathered friends in Squad F include twittering posh bird Lofty (Pip Torrens) and muscled but dim Geordie twins Toughwood and Tailfeather (Brian Lonsdale and Dan Roberts respectively). Slapstick flying into walls to establish ineptitude of Squad F along with copious fart jokes courtesy of Bugsy seem to rep the pics idea of funny. Clumsily intercut are scenes showing the interrogation of RHPS fighter Mercury (John Cleese) at the claws of Nazi falcon General von Talon (Tim Curry) in order to ascertain the hideout of the French Resistance. Squadron F is finally given a mission to fly across the English Channel to collect a message from the Resistance occasioning pics only truly laugh-out-loud line from a reluctant Bugsy who offers the very David Brentish ""Maybe Im not that conscientious but I do object."" Enemy attack as the bird squad crosses the Channel is exciting and competently enough animated to distract from nagging logical questions such as why if theyre birds do they have to take a plane and parachute into France in the first place. Unfortunately ""Valiants"" best bits are too few and arrive too late to amuse all but very young children and aficionados of vintage Brit war films. Comparisons will be inevitable with Aardman Animations-DreamWorks similarly British-made avian-themed 2000 effort ""Chicken Run"" which more lightly evoked a WWII-atmosphere via reference to ""The Great Escape."" Like ""Chicken Run"" ""Valiant"" struggles with the inherent difficulties of making bird characters both cute and well bird-like. Lumpy bulgy-eyed and only recognizable as pigeons through an intense effort of will on the audiences part the cast of ""Valiant"" appears even more ungainly than ""Chicken Runs"" half-hatched plasticine poultry although CGI allows for more convincing feather textures. Still in terms of gags-per-reel and sheer inventiveness the flawed but likable ""Chicken Run"" has the drop on old-fashioned and bland ""Valiant"" which serves best to illustrate how far the bar has been raised for animated fare. In fact the trailer for Blue Sky Studios ""Ice Age 2"" reaped the biggest laugh at the London screening caught for ""Valiant."" Vocal perfs are fine if disappointing given the firepower of the cast. McGregors warm tenor perks up Valiant though Gervais a performer with great improvisational gifts seems penned in by the dry script. Curry brings characteristic brio to the main baddie role. Rest of the tech package is serviceable with George Fentons low-key but savvy mimicry of rousing WWII-era scores providing the standout element.

British tots apparently do -- or so one assumes after viewing ""Valiant"" a charming animated comedy from across the pond that will probably disappear quickly from these shores. Though its made with wit style and sweetness it may be a tricky match for American audiences. The humor is very British and the historical story seems to require a little more knowledge than its very young target audience may possess. Then again kids can be very good at filtering out what doesnt make sense and at 76 minutes ""Valiant"" just might be an entertaining distraction. (My 6-year-old companion enjoyed herself and even learned a new word -- ""sabotage."") Its certainly catnip for parents who will enjoy picking out the British all-star voice cast. Ewan McGregor sounding uncommonly plucky provides the voice of the movies hero Valiant Pigeon a small but determined bird who wants to do something big for his country. In the manner of all childrens-movie heroes Valiant says goodbye to his mother (who urges him to ""eat breakfast before you go"" and then cheerfully regurgitates a worm for him) and marches off to do Something Important. Because its 1944 something important is to join the elite Royal Homing Pigeon Service (RHPS) and deliver vital messages between France and England during the war. Movie review Showtimes and trailer""Valiant"" with the voices of Ewan McGregor Ricky Gervais Tim Curry Jim Broadbent Hugh Laurie John Cleese John Hurt Olivia Williams. Directed by Gary Chapman from a screenplay by Jordan Katz George Webster and George Melrod. 76 minutes. Rated G. Several theaters. Hes joined by a motley array of avian aviators including scruffy con bird Bugsy (voiced by Ricky Gervais of ""The Office"") and tough drill sergeant Sarge (Jim Broadbent) who hollers ""I will make birds of you turkeys"" After basic training Valiant and his cohorts head to France where they meet up with the French Resistance (or rather its mouse division) face the very scary falcon General Von Talon (Tim Curry) and eventually win the day after a breathless and really quite exciting race across the English Channel not to mention several choruses of ""Rule Britannia."" The animation though at times artful (Sarge in particular is a lovely pigeonish shade of iridescent aqua) isnt up to Pixar standards; then again it undoubtedly wasnt made on a Pixar budget either. But no matter; ""Valiant"" is never a hardship to watch (though falcon lovers may be unhappy to see their feathered friends as Nazis) and its often delightful for any age. ""Can you burp on cue?"" a bird asks Bugsy. ""Yeah I can burp on all the letters"" he replies. ""Not just Q."" Some humor it turns out translates just fine.

Credit Buena Vista Pictures Valiant and his friends are finding training a little tricky. Credit Buena Vista Pictures Photo Buena Vista Pictures FILM CLIPS / Also opening Friday 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Valiant Animated comedy. Starring Ewan McGregor Ricky Gervais Hugh Laurie and John Cleese.Directed by Gary Chapman. (Rated G. 75 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Clearly running low on ideas Walt Disney Pictures showcases the unlikely combination of pigeons and the Third Reich in its latest animated film. The finished product ""Valiant"" is a passable animated feature that will entertain small children but feels as if it was thrown together quickly. Despite a decent cast of mostly British voice actors and better-than-average computer animation the movie seems rushed at 76 minutes and is only marginally funny. Exploring the world of the carrier pigeon ""Valiant"" intends to be a send- up of World War II movies. Our hero is a runty youngster named Valiant (Ewan McGregor) who wants to enlist in the military but isnt taken seriously because of his size. Along with hygiene-challenged pigeon Bugsy (Ricky Gervais in the Eddie Murphy role) and several other fowl who get little more than an introduction Valiant goes against a small flock of Nazi-esque falcons -- they wear regalia but dont have swastikas -- with the balance of power between the Axis and Allies at stake. Jokes about subjects including the Geneva Convention will fly above kids heads but arent particularly amusing for adults either. ""Im not that conscientious but I do object"" is typical of the less-than-witty repartee in the script. The rest of the dialogue is dominated by throwaway motivational cliches that may not have been cribbed from ""Braveheart"" but still seem written for a screaming Mel Gibson with a lot of blue paint on his face. (""Its not the size of your wingspan its the size of your spirit"") Valiant isnt any scarier than the edgiest old Disney films such as ""Sleeping Beauty"" but it has a surplus of darkness. For a summer escape comedy there are a lot of overcast skies as if the movie was shot in Pacifica. Even when the dialogue is half-hearted theres a lot of action for the kids to enjoy and the movie features high-quality animation. Totalitarian falcons may be a weird choice for a childrens film but they look pretty sweet. -- Advisory This film contains some mild violence and dark themes that may be scary for small children. Theres also a seagull with a pencil for a leg thats kind of freaky looking. -- Peter Hartlaub Elevator to the Gallows Crime thriller. Starring Jeanne Moreau and Maurice Ronet. Directed by Louis Malle. (Not rated. In French with English subtitles. 88 minutes. At the Lumiere and theBerkeleys Act I amp; II.) As French crime thrillers go this is about as good as it gets. Its also an important film historically and to top it off the jazz score by Miles Davis is famous in its own right. Made in 1958 ""Elevator to the Gallows"" was the first feature in Louis Malles long directorial career and probably his best. The story is pure pulp fiction about a murder plan that goes bad but what really counts is the fatalistic atmosphere. A disaffected veteran (Maurice Ronet) sets out to kill his boss an arms dealer and winds up missing a rendezvous with his girlfriend (Jeanne Moreau) who thinks shes been betrayed. Meanwhile a juvenile delinquent (Georges Poujouly) and his girlfriend (Yori Bertin) steal the veterans car and wind up in a bloody scrape with two foreign tourists. The heart of the picture is the Moreau characters odyssey much of it at night and accompanied by poetic internal monologues as she visits bars and cafes in search of her missing lover. The film is also about the passing of the older generation in France and young peoples ill-fated hopes for escape. The black-and-white cinematography of Henri Decae who went on to work with Jean-Pierre Melville and Francois Truffaut gives the movie the clarity of a dream and offers a vision of the City of Light as melancholy and haunted. Because of the films mood and style its low budget and use of location shooting and because it offered a turn on what was considered an American genre some historians cite it as one of the first examples of the French New Wave. (In the grand academic tradition of hairsplitting others consider it a predecessor to that movement.) This rerelease features a new 35-millimeter print of a restoration made under the supervision of Malles family. -- Advisory The killings depicted are tame by todays standards but the subject matter is unsuitable for children. -- Walter Addiego Gods Sandbox Drama. Directed by Doron Eran. (In Hebrew and English with English subtitles. Not Rated. 86 minutes. At the Galaxy.) Before we delve into social politics lets step back for a moment and appreciate the dreamy beach setting of Doron Erans ""Gods Sandbox."" Its colorful the sun is hot the water is warm and theres this cool guy who runs a cafe who also happens to be a Bedouin storyteller. Into this inviting setting thats popular with Israelis and Western tourists -- a literal oasis sandwiched between the desert and the sea -- comes Liz (Razia Israeli) a 60-year-old author who is searching for her runaway daughter Rachel (Orly Perel). Rachel doesnt want to go back. Shes a free spirit complete with the requisite tattoos; she calls her controlling mom the Strangler. She has an immediate mistrust of the Bedouin storyteller Mustapha (Sami Samir) presumably because of his relationship with her daughter but no it is actually because he is a Bedouin and the story he tells disorients her. The story is a local legend set during the 1960s at the same resort. Back then it was a hangout for hippies. One of them a Rachel-like free spirit named Leila (the captivating Meital Duan) falls for a dignified and devastatingly handsome tribesman Najim (Juliano Merr). They have a torrid love affair and he decides to leave his wife and children. For this he is kicked out of the tribe and Leila and Najim wander the desert together. Najim is tempted though when he finds out how he can be welcomed back into the tribe which involves Leila and it is not a pleasant option of course. ""Gods Sandbox"" is a fairly well-made film reasonably directed by Eran and it is a plea for womens rights as the Middle East gradually transitions from a tradition-bound society to a modern one. As it turns out the beach is more than a geographic oasis -- its an emotional and political one as well. -- Advisory This film contains nudity sex scenes and scenes of torture. -- G. Allen Johnson The Keeper The Legend of Omar Khayyam  Drama. Starring Bruno Lastra Moritz Bleibtreu Rade Serbedzija Vanessa Redgrave Christopher Simpson Marie Espinosa and Adam Echahly. Directed co- written andco-produced by Kayvan Mashayekh. (Rated PG. 95 minutes. In English and Persian with English subtitles. At the Opera Plaza and Shattuck Cinemas in Berkeley.) For generations of people the name Omar Khayyam has been associated with poetry and Persia. Almost 900 years after his death Khayyams life takes on new meaning in this beautifully shot drama about an Iranian American family descended from the great poet astronomer and mathematician. The familys modern life in Houston and the flashbacks to Khayyams time in Persia stir up important issues of religious tolerance cultural traditions and adapting to a changing world. We first see Khayyam as a young boy with two close friends Hassan Sabbah and a girl named Darya. The trios evolving relationship into adulthood anchors the story line woven into these flashbacks Sabbah (played by the Ireland-born Christopher Simpson) becomes doctrinaire about his feeling that Islam should be the principle force in peoples everyday lives saying ""Reason above faith is heresy""; and Khayyam (Italian actor Bruno Lastra) embraces art science and love with a more secularized passion. He drinks (some of his most famous poems herald the joys of wine) and he strips off his clothing in the throes of passion with the beautiful Darya (Marie Espinosa). Meanwhile war is on the horizon pitting a Persian army headed by Malikshah (Moritz Bleibtreu of ""Run Lola Run"" and ""The Experiment"") against advancing Crusaders. Back in Houston drama of a more familial sense is happening. The familys eldest son Nader (Puya Behinaein) is dying and its Nader whos upheld the tradition of orating the familys connection to Khayyam. The logical successor to Nader is his younger brother 12-year-old Kamran (Adam Echahly) whos fascinated by the epic tale of his ancestor. Kamrans father doesnt share his enthusiasm castigating his children for focusing on the past at the expense of their new lives in America. Vanessa Redgrave plays a wealthy woman who encourages Kamrans search for the meaning of Khayyams life and poetry and his newfound role as storyteller. A mix of fact and fiction ""The Keeper"" is director Kayvan Mashayekhs first major film. Rough around the edges its still a formidable movie thats stunning visually. Mashayekh shot much of ""The Keeper"" in Uzbekistan where Khayyam lived for years. The ancient mosques and buildings we see are still standing evidence of the spread of Persias power and cultural influence during its empire thousands of years ago. Eighty years ago Persias monarch Reza Shah Pahlavi changed the countrys name from Persia to Iran. ""The Keeper"" connects 21st century America to Persias rich tradition of culture and the arts. Khayyam is the embodiment of that tradition someone embraced by people around the world for his moving words. The films international cast is a testament to that. -- Advisory Scenes of death and intimacy. -- Jonathan Curiel Most Popular 1 Cops Son of billionaire former supermodel arrested after... 2 Dear Abby I want to contact mistress from 45 years ago 3 Ann Coulter Hammered by Conservatives for Smearing US War... 4 Dear Abby I dont want anyone to know that Ive retired 5 Iceland man says Donald Trumps son left white powder at... 6 33 signs youre living in the San Francisco bubble 7 Inmate charged in 2015 quadruple slaying in S.F. 8 Oakland-bound medical plane crashes -- 4 killed 9 San Francisco ranks surprisingly low on the list of 20 Most... 10 How low can Giants go?

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Walking out of a preview screening of ""Valiant"" a gray-haired woman turned to her friend and fretted that there would be much in the movie its intended audience just wouldnt get. After all this G-rated animated feature about an oddball group of carrier pigeons during World War II is yet another addition to the ever-expanding library of films about the greatest generation. Sure this ones for the birds and the kiddies but shes got a point. Much of the movies cleverness will fly over the heads of the wee ones and resonate more with those who lived through WWII or are familiar with the newsreels the vivacious nurses and the French Resistance represented here by a beret-wearing mouse named Charles De Girl. Its tempting then to call this U.S.-British-produced endeavor an odd duck. Except that ""Valiant"" (written by Jordan Katz George Webster and George Melrod) uses nearly every pun in the book. ""If we dont find some birds soon our goose is cooked"" says one fine-feathered commander facing a shortage in trainees (a dearth most city dwellers will have trouble grieving). ""We have ways of making you squawk"" threatens the uber-falcon villain as he lords over a dark cement bunker. As the movie takes flight its May 1944 and a squadron of homing pigeons winging its way over the English Channel from France is intercepted by German falcons. Tim Curry plays Gen. Von Talon who has some sport trying to get captured flier Mercury (John Cleese) to spill the seed. These are not the first losses incurred by the English and the Royal Homing Pigeons Service is running low on recruits. In a rural community Valiant (Ewan McGregor) more a squab than a grown- up aches to contribute to the war effort. When Gutsy (Hugh Laurie) a puffy-chested decorated flier visits Valiants village Valiant decides to enlist. In London Valiant meets Bugsy a hustler in dire need of a bath who in squiring Valiant to the recruiting office winds up signed up. As Bugsy Ricky Gervais from the BBC version of ""The Office"" provides the movies first real sparkle. Humans - the agents of war - dont make much of an appearance in ""Valiant."" We catch a glimpse of a soldier as he whisks away the new recruits on his motorcycle. Instead Sarge (Jim Broadbent) trains Bugsy Valiant Lofty and twin brothers Toughwood and Tailspin in the ins and outs the swoops and dives necessary to carry messages across enemy lines. Messages are a touchy issue when it comes to kid flicks. And the ones ""Valiant"" sends are curious. Its not the size of a pigeons wingspan but the breadth of his spirit is the repeated tiny-tot moral. But what should we make of a movie whose only war doubter starts out as a scam artist? When Bugsy says ""I would never violate my core beliefs"" even the youngest viewer understands that Bugsys only value is Bugsy.  1/2Valiant"" G |1 hour 16 minutes|ANIMATED|Directed by Gary Chapman; written by Jordan Katz and George Webster and George Melrod; animation director Richard Purdum; starring voices of Ewan McGregor Ricky Gervais Tim Curry Jim Broadbent Hugh Laurie John Cleese John Hurt |Opens today at area theaters.

Chicken Run"" it aint.But its a kiddie movie and I suppose you could do worse for a late-summer air-conditioned 76 minutes at the multiplex. Not a lot worse though. Set in the thick of World War II Valiant"" concerns itself with the plucky members of the Royal Homing Pigeon Service whose mission is to carry important messages to and from the high command while dodging the claws of evil Nazi falcons led by the suitably Darth Vaderish Von Talon (Curry). Yes its that weird.Our hero is Valiant (McGregor) a pint-sized but enthusiastic new recruit who signs up for basic training under the ramrod tutelage of Broadbents Sargeant. His platoon-mates include an upper-class twit (Pip Torrens) two big and agreeably dumb brothers (Brian Lonsdale and Dan Roberts) and Bugsy (Gervais) a con-artist city pigeon who has enlisted only to hide out from a couple of angry magpies looking to shake him down. Theres also a pretty nurse (Williams) but when Valiant and she start puffing out their breast feathers at each other you may get the willies.The training sequences are a dumbed-down mishmash of every army movie ever made -- offered with the confidence that your children havent seen any of them -- but Valiant"" does stagger into flight once the platoon embarks on a mission to occupied France where they encounter a couple of French Resistance mice (cue the Edith Piaf) and more of those falcons. The latter factor heavily in the climactic sequence which features Valiant rescuing a loopy imprisoned pigeon played by Cleese showing his mettle to RHPS commander Gutsy (Laurie) and saving the day by hiding a top-secret message in his little pigeon crop. He presents it to Gutsy covered with slime which grossed me right out but delighted the 8-year-old I happened to bring along to the screening.Still much of Valiant"" seemed pitched below even her level to the 5-and-younger crowd who dont really need to know why cowardly Bugsy has an unexplained change of heart in time to help assist in the heroics. The digital artwork by the new British company Vanguard Animation is bright and uncomplicated and nowhere near as sophisticated as anything Pixar or DreamWorks have done -- you can feel the vectors holding the scenery up -- and a larger unsolved problem is that pigeons are well ugly.From this parents point of view the best part about Valiant"" was the chat about the French Resistance and Normandy on the drive home -- how often does your kid ask for historical clarification? Otherwise it may be a cute enough movie but not at current market rates two parents a handful of children and multiplex grub will probably bring your total to more than 50 which translates to Valiant"" costing about 67 cents per minute of your time. The top-secret message this pigeon is carrying reads Wait for the DVD."" Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

This subject is one that the animated Valiant cant even get off the ground. Valiant is a pigeon who wants to be a transporter of tactical messages during World War II. Hes voiced by Ewan McGregor. Disney/Vanguard Animation Valiant doubles as the name of the pigeon protagonist in this dose of Disney-lite which is too inoffensive to engender the hostility once reserved for Howard the Duck. But if the cigarettes that advertisers once described as ""mild"" were as mild as this movie minors could buy them at the concession stand. Valiant is voiced by Robots Ewan McGregor an actor apparently no longer in a Trainspotting mood. Inspired to join the Royal Homing Pigeon Service he goes through the standard boot-camp ritual (push-ups and a cultural smorgasbord of new buddies) a quaintly benign Full Metal Plumage experience. About the movie Valiant   (out of four) Stars Voices of Ewan McGregor Jim Broadbent Tim Curry Hugh Laurie John Cleese Director Gary Chapman Distributor Walt Disney Pictures Running time 1 hour 15 minutes Rated G Opens Friday nationwide He romances a nurse and finally faces enemy fire as his squadron flies (oddly by plane) over the English Channel to collect a message from the French Resistance. Meanwhile a captured squadron member (John Cleese) undergoes second-degree interrogation from a Nazi falcon (Tim Curry) the latter sporting an eyepatch that looks as if it were purchased at Teutonic Novelties. It cant be easy making the under-10 audience comprehend historical context yet 2000s well-received Chicken Run was a period piece as well with no shortage of World War II in-jokes. Even with its 1 hour 15-minute running time Valiant is peppered with dead spots. And theres something about an animated feature that isnt working that makes the fidgety/whiny youngsters in the theater sound even louder. Historically aware adults will sense what the movie is trying to do but this is one that too many will sit through with a ""stiff upper beak"" (a phrase from the script). As with so much of what gets dropped into theaters at the end of summer Valiant is ripe for a clipped-wings response. Stick with the penguins.

"Valiant Flies Over Wee Heads washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Valiant Flies Over Wee Heads Brave-but- undersized Valiant far right voiced by Ewan McGregor realizes his dream of joining the Royal Homing Pigeon Service and is joined by new recruits Lofty Tailfeather and Toughwood. (Walt Disney Pictures Via Associated Press) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday August 19 2005 TRACKING THE World War II exploits of a group of misfit British carrier pigeons trying to get an important message through enemy lines (manned by German falcons) from the French Resistance (here represented by mice wearing berets) the animated feature ""Valiant"" is an inoffensive diversion for all small children interested enough in 20th-century military history to know about D-Day. In other words Huh? Oh its a pleasant enough comic adventure -- for grown-ups that is who are already familiar with the backstory. Given the fact though that most members of the demographic typically targeted by G-rated films running a scant hour and a quarter do not possess the prerequisite knowledge of Nazis and the Allied struggle its an odd mix. On the one hand ""Valiant"" is a mite too hard to follow for most of the kiddie crowd wholl want to see it. (Just try explaining to little Timmy that the joke about Gen. Von Talon voiced by Tim Curry being a vegetarian is based on the fact that Hitler was one too.) On the other hand its neither especially funny nor overly exciting for Mom and Dad who are probably going to be the only people in the room who will fully get its premise. The film cleverly enough opens with a parody of old black-and-white newsreel footage soliciting volunteers for something called the Royal Homing Pigeon Service. (I can just hear it now ""Mommy whats a homing pigeon?"" ""Whats a newsreel?"" ""Whats black-and-white?"") Wanting to do his part for Britannia is little Valiant (Ewan McGregor) a runty if patriotic wood pigeon who signs up despite his short wing span and his mothers protests. Rounding out Valiants unit is Bugsy (Ricky Gervais) a fly-ridden con artist who enlists only to escape a couple of his angry victims; Lofty (Pip Torrens) an upper-class birdbrain; meatheads Toughwood and Tailfeather (Brian Lonsdale and Dan Roberts); and the heroic squadron leader Gutsy (Hugh Laurie). The plot essentials are fairly simple. Valiant and his mates parachute into occupied France where they must pick up a message from the Resistance and carry it home to London. The problem is Von Talon and his minions who have already captured one bird (John Cleese) and extracted information from him about Valiants mission and who are just waiting to well eat the main characters for lunch. Sorry kids but those carcasses aint chicken bones. Gosh will the plucky little pigeon make it? I must admit I wasnt exactly sitting on the edge of my seat although my 6-year-old son was. (Full disclosure Its the only way he can avoid falling into the crack at the back.) Speaking of falling into cracks Im afraid that thats exactly whats going to happen to ""Valiant."" Too dependent on a knowledge of RAF-inspired cinematic derring-do like ""633 Squadron"" (or at least ""Hogans Heroes"") for the average tyke yet too tepid for their taller counterparts ""Valiant"" is ultimately one strange bird.

Who recruits and trains these pigeons? Other pigeons who wear clothes and take little notice of humans. Precious few of those warlike primates are glimpsed at all in fact. Its a pigeons army and a pigeons world. But its not of course a pigeons war. This disconnect between birdkind and mankind isnt a huge narrative problem...since theres very little narrative to worry about anyway. Wee Valiant joins up gets an impossible mission faces some Teutonic falcons pulls a no-bird-left-behind with war buddy Bugsy (Ricky Gervais) and so forth. But such conceptual laziness (why exactly does a Nazi bird have a human-size portrait of himself?) does make you appreciate the clever artistry of a Chicken Run or Finding Nemo where great care has been taken to cultivate a talking animals essential ""humanity"" while leaving him firmly embedded in his natural milieu. Such delicate considerations clearly did not burden the pixel pushers behind Valiant. The production house Vanguard Animation was birthed by Disney as an alternative to pricey lapidary Pixar -- which might be why this movies aesthetics seem governed by its bottom line The CG is on the rubbery side and the backdrops are jarringly 2-D. But Valiant isnt so hard to look at -- its hard to listen to. The script is gabby and flabby in the first act and the dialogue is balsa-wood inanity outside of Gervais better bits. (""Maybe Im not conscientious"" says the rogue attempting desertion ""but I do object."") On the other hand the difficult issues of avian flatulence and bulimia are finally addressed. Vividly.
