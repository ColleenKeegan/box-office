(Cathy Kanavy/Focus Features) By Ty Burr Globe Staff / August 22 2008 Email| Print| Single Page| | Text size - + The British farceur and TV comic Steve Coogan has been tickling American ribs ever since he landed here with a splash in 2002s ""24 Hour Party People."" In the new comedy ""Hamlet 2"" he comes perilously close to wearing out his welcome. Its actually a pretty fascinating sight.Coogan plays a failed LA actor and current Albuquerque high school drama teacher named Dana Marschz. The character exists in one of two emotional states insanely perky good cheer or suicidal rage. But the dream of ""the theatah"" keeps him propped up even when no one comes to see his crummy school plays adapted from hit movies like ""Erin Brockovich."" He has two stagestruck acolytes a virginal bunny (Phoebe Strole) and a closet case (Skylar Astin) but other than that nothing. Even Danas own wife (Catherine Keener looking bored) thinks hes an infantile twerp.He is an infantile twerp and Coogan rubs the character in our face like an industrial-strength irritant. This may be one of the most intentionally grating lead performances in a movie since ""The King of Comedy"" and it takes a kind of weird bravery to jump out of a plane this high without a parachute. I watched half the movie through my fingers terrified to see what Coogan would do next in his bid to push the character into new realms of giggling obnoxiousness.The problem is you never believe this delusional pixie could ever function in the real world the rest of the movies characters live in. After the school cuts back on electives Danas drama class is suddenly flooded with the tough crowd - Hispanics in hoodies and so on - and the students look upon their bizarre new teacher the way you would an epileptic frog wondering which way hell jump next.The teacher sets out to bring his new flock to the flame of drama and suddenly you realize ""Hamlet 2"" is going to be a parody of inspirational inner-city high school movies like ""Dangerous Minds"" the 1995 Michelle Pfeiffer chestnut. If anything director/co-writer Andrew Fleming (he made the delightful ""Dick"" back in 1999) isnt sneaky enough about what hes sending up. The shaky camerawork announces it and so quite literally do the characters.The satire extends to giving the chief bad boy (Joseph Julian Soria) parents who are upper-middle-class intellectuals instead of the poor Mexican trash that Dana (and we) assume theyll turn out to be. They object to their sons involvement in the teachers new play not because its sacrilegious but because its lousy theater. And theyre not wrong.The play is called ""Hamlet 2"" (the first ""Hamlet"" was fine as far as it went but couldnt the ending have been more upbeat?) and Dana pours all his daddy issues into it. He writes in the character of Jesus Christ and gives him a musical number ""Rock Me Sexy Jesus."" The school principal reacts as youd expect and suddenly Dana and his play are First Amendment darlings complete with a fire-breathing lawyer (Amy Poehler not given enough to do).The big show at the films end is funny enough but terribly predictable in its toothless desire to offend; only the most humorless bible-thumpers wont have a good giggle. The problem is that few movies since ""The Producers"" have been able to pull off this sort of shock treatment without seeming smug. In desperation the movie keeps throwing in wild cards like actress Elisabeth Shue playing a burned-out fictional version of herself. Shes charming and sos the notion of a Hollywood starlet gone to ground but huh?Worse is that Dana Marschz never gels into a character that makes any sense. A useful comparison is with Corky St. Clair the deathless theater junkie played by Christopher Guest in 1996s ""Waiting for Guffman."" The portrayal was cruel but it breathed real life; you could imagine Corky existing (and having a breakdown) off-screen. Not so with Dana whom Coogan seems to be making up as he goes. The performance is a series of eccentric riffs without any connective tissue. Hes acting in a more daring movie than ""Hamlet 2"" but its a far sillier one too A one-man show with blinders on.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Theres a distinct promise of insanity in that grin. Coogan looks like some long-lost member of the early Beatles who with a loosening of a screw or two could easily turn into Sweeney Todd. On American movie screens most of the characters he has played have been scathingly blitzed showbiz narcissists like the frothing-at-the-mouth indie-rock impresario of 24 Hour Party People the obscenely vain movie star of Tristram Shandy A Cock amp; Bull Story or the flyweight director in Tropic Thunder. (Better yet there was Coogans bristling and magnificent comic turn as -- yes -- Steve Coogan in the one immortal segment of Jim Jarmuschs Coffee and Cigarettes.) Coogan has portrayed his share of egomaniacs all right but he has never done egomaniacal failure with the loopy gusto and sheer fearless squirm-inducement he brings to Hamlet 2. In the opening moments we see him in a pair of fake television commercials that are every bit as hysterical as the fake trailers that open Tropic Thunder (hes especially funny as one-half of a strolling sunshiny couple in an ad for a herpes medication). Whats he doing in these late-night spots from hell? Theyre the career highlights of Coogans Dana Marschz a brutally untalented actor who has become a self-loathing high school drama teacher in Tucson Ariz. Despised by his wife (Catherine Keener at her most scalding) hes also a walking punchline to everyone at school -- students administrators a brainy shrimp of a junior drama critic -- all of whom can see that hes a dismal sweaty emasculated failure. Its written all over his face. But that isnt the only thing written there. So are delusions of grandeur fear and hysteria and a tear-streaked quivering joy that verges at times on the psychotic. Dana is a loser who thinks hes an artist and Coogan plays him as a man who can barely make out whats in front of his eyes so blinded is he by the hallucinatory glow of his ego-mirage. The more sincerely Coogan gushes the more he seems to be taking stage cues from tiny voices in his head. Accidentally bashing one of his students with a wastebasket Dana turns around with a gleeful smirk and says encouragingly of his mistake ""It was stupid but it was also theater"" Dana wants so badly to connect that he turns his whole life into theater. When its announced that the drama department will be permanently axed from the curriculum he decides to fight the move by mounting one last singular production writing and staging a rock-musical sequel to Hamlet in which a time machine returns the great Dane so that he can save himself and everyone else in the play. The brain-bogglingly terrible show also features Jesus Star Wars the Gay Mens Chorus of Tucson performing ""Someone Saved My Life Tonight"" and Danas lifelong conflict with his own father. As a movie Hamlet 2 is lively energetically daft and very very scrappy -- a broader more loony-tunes knockoff of Waiting for Guffman that takes the thespian-loser hero and lets-put-on-an-awful-show tastelessness of that Christopher Guest classic blends them with a satirical travesty of inspirational-teacher movies and then throws in a token tweak of conservative values. It must be said The movie combines these elements so randomly that its like something tossed together at a suburban salad bar. In its farcical craft and tone Hamlet 2 keeps slipping and sliding around but as a pedestal for the riotous beyond-shame theatrics of Steve Coogan unhinged the film is often dementedly hilarious. He mugs he glowers he hams up the telling of jokes too corny-horrible to print he mocks and vamps like a venomous drama queen. As its opening night approaches the show begins to inspire local controversy since it is offensive -- not to mention nuts -- in almost every way. Yet when Hamlet 2 finally goes up songs like ""Rock Me Sexy Jesus"" give off such a happy blast of cluelessness that the show becomes almost innocent. Its stupid but its theater. Its also a high school musical that would make John Waters proud.

But that just might happen at the fictional West Mesa High School in Tuscon Ariz. setting of the loony irreverent ""Hamlet 2."" Welcome to the world of failed-actor-turned-failed-drama-teacher Dana Marschz (Steve Coogan) who wants desperately to make a name for himself -- if only someone anyone students administrators could pronounce it. Marsh? Marsk? Mars? Whatever. Let others mount productions of ""Oklahoma"" and ""West Side Story."" Or if theyre really daring ""Sweeney Todd."" Dana goes for offbeat fare like an adaptation of ""Erin Brockovich"" starring his acolytes the sexually uncertain Rand (Skylar Astin) and the over-emoting Epiphany (Phoebe Strole). The school newspapers drama critic a junior Addison DeWitt but less kind scorns these efforts as does the principal who plans to shutter the drama department. Not that the move will markedly cut costs. Dana doesnt even receive a salary which may explain why rollerblades are his sole means of transportation. The guy is striking out on all fronts. Just ask his derisive wife Brie (the wonderful Catherine Keener) whos been trying to get pregnant for years. Vilified at school marginalized at home and ridiculed pretty much everywhere Dana determines to summon his muse. Though this be madness the result is a musical sequel to ""Hamlet"" whose dramatis personae include Jesus (as embodied by Dana himself). To describe the show as God-awful is like calling Dom Perignon a fizzy beverage. Lets just say that if Mel Brookss producers had known about Danas enterprise they would never have chosen ""Springtime for Hitler"" as their surefire flop. ENLARGE ""Hamlet 2"" a hit at this years Sundance Film Festival is the antidote to ""High School Musical."" The jokes dont always work; theres some disappointingly inspirational blah-blah that belongs in a far more well-behaved movie while a repetitive gag about a student bashing her head doesnt even rise to the level of sophomoric. But there is Amy Poehler in a terrific brief bit as an ACLU lawyer and Elisabeth Shue (playing herself) as a sympathetic nurse at a fertility clinic; even the star of ""Leaving Las Vegas"" and ""Cocktail"" cant catch a break in Hollywood these days. Mostly though theres the endlessly resourceful endlessly inventive bedazzling Mr. Coogan. Hamlet Schmamlet. Not since ""Death of a Salesman"" has failure been quite so entertaining. The Rocker ENLARGE Teddy Geiger (left) Josh Gad Rainn Wilson and Emma Stone in The Rocker. 20th C. Fox Teen comedies have become as ritualized as Kabuki. There is a carefully calibrated gross-out factor often having to do with regurgitation; a certain level of nudity generally involving the backsides of the least callipygian cast members and a particular quantity of beer-swilling always by those incapable of holding their liquor. ""The Rocker"" has the requisite vomit the view of some very unfortunate hind quarters and the suds. Its also got a vein of sweetness and charm. Robert ""Fish"" Fishman (Rainn Wilson Dwight on the hit NBC series ""The Office"") is an embittered 40-year-old and really who can blame him? Twenty years ago he was bound for glory as the drummer in Vesuvius a heavy metal band being courted by a major label. But the proffered contract came with a stipulation Replace the percussionist with the nephew of the record company head or no deal. Fishs frightfully loyal bandmates protested the vile nepotism the hideous injustice for a whole nanosecond before cheerfully signing on the dotted line. Vesuvius becomes wildly successful and Fish erupts every time he hears mention of the bands name. This volatility may help explain his inability to hold on to a job. After yet another dismissal from the work force he seeks refuge with his sister (Jane Lynch) brother-in-law (Jeff Garlin) and his geeky nephew Matt (Josh Gad) the bassist in a high-school rock band that goes by the regrettable name A.D.D. When the group loses its drummer before a crucial prom-night gig and the eager Fish steps into the void what follows is a life altering moment for all concerned. Mr. Wilsons wild and crazy aging adolescent plays off nicely against the highly disciplined responsible members of A.D.D. who are more than 20 years his junior. Meet Curtis (Teddy Geiger) the groups tormented guitarist/songwriter and Amelia (the very appealing Emma Stone) whose native language is irony. If they dont quite help Fish sober up he does help them lighten up blessedly a point the movie doesnt oversell. And when Fish decides it may be time to play with someone his own age conveniently there is Curtiss attractive former rocker mom played by Christina Applegate. ENLARGE Anna Faris in House Bunny. Columbia Pictures All are served well by a script that observes of one perfect blond specimen ""Its like Abercrombie is making people now"" and that shows a firm understanding of moral relativism. ""Loads of elevators play Celine Dion. That dont make it right."" House Bunny Orphan Shelley Darlingson (Anna Faris) has finally found a loving surrogate family and a home sweet home at the Playboy mansion in the criminally inane comedy ""House Bunny."" Life couldnt be better. All that the curvaceous sweetly pliant Shelley wants for her 27th birthday is an invitation to be the magazines centerfold; what she gets is a brief letter from ""Hef"" (Hugh Hefner playing himself) requesting that she vacate the premises. Mistaken for a prostitute (tee hee) Shelley spends the night in jail where her innocent double entendres crack up the other inmates (tee hee tee hee). Touchingly eager to find a place she can call home she wanders on to a college campus and becomes house mother at Zeta Alpha Zeta a sorority whose members are such a sorry lot its doubtful that even the tide would take them out. Film Clips Watch a scene from ""The Rocker."" Watch a scene from ""House Bunny."" Shelley teaches her charges among them the bespectacled intellectual Natalie (here again Emma Stone) and the heavily pierced heavily scornful Mona (Kat Dennings) how to dress how to apply makeup how to be sexy and most crucially how to be popular. If Zeta fails to attract a new roster of members -- currently there are exactly seven -- it will be forced to disband and the house sold to the snooty conniving sorority down the street. Predictably Shelley herself learns some important lessons for instance that life is about more than being sexy; its about being true to yourself. ""House Bunny"" s ""Legally Blonde"" roots show. Written by the same team responsible for the 2001 hit starring Reese Witherspoon ""Bunny"" offers up a similar theme a similar palette (think pink) and a similar protagonist a supposed bimbo whos been seriously underestimated. Find television listings for Steve Coogan Anna Faris and more at LocateTV. Unfortunately Ms. Faris has neither an adroit script -- ""House Bunny"" is a stale collection of dumb bunny jokes -- nor Ms. Witherspoons wily charm. And the filmmakers do Ms. Faris no favors by inviting comparisons to Marilyn Monroe. A scene of this bunny in a full skirt standing over a hissing manhole cover -- shades of ""The Seven Year Itch"" -- is an embarrassment. All the more so when Ms. Faris gasps ""Who knew steam could be hot?"" Who indeed. Joe Morgenstern is on vacation. Joe Morgenstern is on vacation.

In this image released by Focus Features Steve Coogan left and Skylar Astin perform in a scene from ""Hamlet 2."" Photo Cathy Kanavy AP Movie review Hamlet {hellip} the sequel 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Hamlet 2 Comedy. Starring Steve Coogan Catherine Keener Elisabeth Shue and Amy Poehler. Directed by Andrew Fleming. (R. 92 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) In ""Hamlet 2"" Steve Coogan is required to act the part of a really bad actor. This misguided soul Dana Marschz with an unpronounceable last name throws himself into his roles. But hes like an off-key tenor who cannot grasp the effects of his strident sounds. A conspiracy of casting agents kill off Danas dream of playing ""Hamlet I."" Hes relegated to TV commercials on embarrassing subjects. In one he looks into a camera and with a triumphant grin as if hed just won an Olympic gold medal announces ""Im having a herpes outbreak but youd never know it."" All this is by way of understanding why Dana has become an acting coach at a sunny high school in Tucson. Hes madly jealous of the two regulars in his class because they possess something he will never have talent. Christopher Guest in ""Waiting for Guffman"" raised the bar on amateur acting instructors. Even wearing a cravat and gesturing dramatically Coogan cant match his predecessors pretentiousness. But hes up to something else. Coogan a comedy star in England for the first time has a lead role in a Hollywood movie. Although the material is uneven - it starts slow and doesnt kick in until the second half when his students put on a play called ""Hamlet 2"" - Coogan displays what has been memorably called ""funny bones."" To see him is to want to laugh. In his scenes with Danas wife (the always endearing Catherine Keener) Coogan communicates a vulnerability reminiscent of Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. In the hope of improving her chances of getting pregnant she tells him to start wearing loose pants. From then on he is shown only in gym clothes. The back is cut from one pair to allow his butt cheeks to air out. Coogan is all innocence walking around as if this attire is the norm. Danas wife finally announces that she is with child. Unfortunately it is not his child. Attempting to grasp this Coogans mobile face goes through a range of emotions ending near tears. Like its low-key star ""Hamlet 2"" is more likely to elicit quiet chuckles than raucous laughter. Heres a test to tell whether you are likely to find it funny Danas singular idea which he considers brilliant is to put on plays based on successful movies such as ""Erin Brockovich"" ""Mississippi Burning"" and ""Mr. Hollands Opus."" If you find yourself laughing at the choice of these specific movies ""Hamlet 2"" is for you. Written by Pam Brady (""South Park Bigger Longer amp; Uncut"") and director Andrew Fleming (""Dick"") it has an edge and degree of sophistication not seen in most summer comedies. Faced with losing funds for the drama department Dana taxes his imagination for a play that might win back audiences and comes up with ""Hamlet 2."" Because almost everyone died in the first one he conceives of a time machine to bring Hamlet and friends back to the auditorium. His production is fraught with problems. School officials try to stop it because of its political incorrectness. His case is picked up by an ACLU lawyer Cricket Feldstein (the hilarious Amy Poehler). Although its no ""Tropic Thunder"" ""Hamlet 2"" does make some digs at the movie industry. Elisabeth Shue the co-star of ""Leaving Las Vegas"" who has faded from the screen appears as herself. The conceit is that shes a nurse working in Arizona with few regrets except that she no longer gets to ""make out with all those cute actors."" Dana is totally starstruck. The production of ""Hamlet 2"" is wild with passages borrowed from ""Jesus Christ Superstar."" Dana sweats his way to the end which is sure to fuel the fantasies of acting teachers all over America. -- Advisory Mild nudity and profane language.

Hamlet 2 (R) Focus (92 min.) Directed by Andrew Fleming. With Steve Coogan Catherine Keener. Opens Friday at theaters in New York. TWO AND A HALF STARS To die to sleep. To sleep perchance to ... giggle? Thats the question asked by ""Hamlet 2"" a twisted new comedy that watches as a desperate self-deluded drama teacher in Tucson tries to save his funding by putting on the most extravagant production he can think of -- a Shakespearean sequel full of space-age special effects and a score cribbed from Elton John. Oh and did we mention the greaser-rock second-act opener starring Jesus? The teachers ideas are a mess and so often is the movie that contains them. ""Hamlet 2"" is filled with sketched-out characters and some moments that just dont work. But its also full of shocks and wickedly witty jokes. While it may never hit the heights of Pythonesque satire its still several grad-school degrees beyond most comedies. Even if it does get a lot of mileage out of its frequently bottomless hero. That man is Steve Coogan the brilliant British comedian whos still best known here for his turn in ""24 Hour Party People"" and a cameo in the kiddie film ""A Night at the Museum."" What neither project quite captures though is what Coogan is best at -- a peculiarly British blend of rage and obsequious flattery of ""shut your bleeding gob"" invective and craven hand-wringing solicitude. John Cleese wrote the book in ""Fawlty Towers."" Coogan has over the years added a few chapters. As drama teacher Dana Marschz hes a bit of a walking joke -- the has-been (actually never-was) actor whos managed to convince himself his current stint in a high school is just his selfless way to pass along his ""love of the craft"" to impressionable youngsters. Unfortunately the only way he knows how to do that is through stilted stagings of hit movies. And then he gets the bright idea of improving ""Hamlet"" -- by adding a time machine. What follows has very little to do with Shakespeare which is a shame -- there are a lot of jokes to be mined there if youve actually read the play. (Sometimes co-writers Andrew Fleming and Pam Brady only seem to have seen the Mel Gibson movie.) But they do understand the comedy of embarrassment -- the sort of cringe-worthy situations that actors like Albert Brooks used to dive into thirstily. They have the perfect lead in Coogan. What his work has always been about -- particularly his British TV work especially his ""Im Alan Partridge"" series -- is that slow-motion car-wreck of a man who finally self-humiliates. Then again he has help here -- mostly from his wife Brie as played by Catherine Keener. No other actress has ever made hostility so enticing; wan and weary here but still hungrily sexy Keener is a wonderful foil. Fleming and Brady -- whose previous credits include lots of TV -- dont have the rich background a movie like this needs. The teenage characters are mostly unsurprising stereotypes; when staged the musical has little to do with ""Hamlet"" or Shakespeare at all. Compared to the mad ""Waiting for Guffman"" -- which satirized community theater and its types with knowing wickedness -- ""Hamlet 2"" is a pale competitor. But it has some hilariously humiliating jokes (Coogan really has no fear) and some surprisingly pointed real-life humor (Elisabeth Shue you are a genuine sport). And even if its only half as smart and polished as it could be -- well that still makes it twice as smart and polished as ""The Love Guru."" Rating note The film contains strong language violence drug use and nudity. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

Star Steve Coogan already a success back home in Britain has courted American audiences for years with limited results. Lets trust this lost opportunity isnt his last best chance. Coogan has made a career of playing clueless idiots most notably in his brilliant BBC show ""Im Alan Partridge."" Never for a moment does this broad satire reach the dizzying heights of that experience. Still it is amusing to watch Coogan go for broke as high school drama teacher Dana Marschz. Each season Dana mounts an ill-advised production thats inevitably panned in the school paper. This year hes determined to top himself and what better way than to improve on Shakespeare with a followup to ""Hamlet""?But the pressures on since Danas life is rapidly falling apart. His students are almost completely uncooperative and things are worse at home where he lives with his alcoholic wife (Catherine Keener). Only his new friend actress Elisabeth Shue (gamely playing herself) seems to understand him. Theres a lot of potential here and a sharper script might have made all the difference. This one goes for the easy laugh nearly every time up to and including the predictably disastrous finale a garish performance of the titular sequel. Fortunately Coogan remains impressively unafraid of humiliation pushing every joke just far enough to keep us watching. But he deserves more. Onscreen at least no one suffers the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune better than he does.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Pity poor Dana Marschz (pronounced ... er ... well do your best). Hes a failed actor whose career highlights are a spear-carrier role on ""Xena"" a herpes-cream TV spot and a cameo as the ""theres got to be a better way"" guy in a Jack LaLanne Power Juicer infomercial. Any lower down on the showbiz totem pole and Marschz would be subterranean. Reinventing himself as a high school drama teacher Marschz remains nine-tenths naive enthusiasm and one dollop of misguided self-confidence. He strides into his baking hot Tucson classroom in academic-looking woolens and corduroy accessorized with contrasting sweat stains. His theater curriculum has only two students an uptight junior diva and a gender-uncertain young man. The only attention his work attracts are withering reviews from the school papers 13-year-old drama critic. When the budget ax swings at his program Marschz decides to go out in a blaze of glory pounding out a sequel to ""Hamlet"" and staging it with the 20-odd uncooperative lunkheads who were mistakenly assigned to his final class. Why thats just crazy enough to work You might say the same of ""Hamlet 2"" a raunchy irreverent slice of school and showbiz satire. Steve Coogan (also currently onscreen as ""Tropic Thunders"" harried film director) makes Marschz a curiously sympathetic buffoon. His wife (Catherine Keener in top emasculating form) harpoons him with sarcasm at every opportunity. He roller-skates to work because he cant afford a car. His farewell production is a go-for-broke extravaganza that improves on Shakespeare by adding a time machine sock-hop tunes and a plum role for himself as a singing dancing Jesus. The sacrilegious show draws the wrath of the school board and threatens to tear the community apart. The movies script by Pam Brady (""South Park Bigger Longer and Uncut"") might divide audiences in the same way with its unrelentingly silly swing-for-the-fences absurdism. The films saving graces are Andrew Flemings easygoing direction and a solid cast. The broader Bradys dialogue and situations become the more Fleming insists that the actors keep a straight face. His low-key approach humanizes the story. Marschz could have become a ridiculous ham but Coogan presents him as an endearing misunderstood kid with heavy father issues working out his childhood traumas onstage. (""If my dad knew what I was up to hed crucify me"" Jesus frets.) Not only do you understand him you root for him despite everything. Keeners part might have been a study on one-dimensional bitchiness but her death-ray glare has a glint of sadness. Shes a shrew but a funny one and you feel sympathy. Elizabeth Shue that all-but-forgotten Oscar nominee pops up to play herself in a cameo without winking at us. HAMLET 2  out of 4 stars Rating R for language including sexual references brief nudity and some drug content. Where Uptown. Fleming saves most of his energy for the blowout final production numbers which play like demented outtakes from ""High School Musical."" The politically incorrect production number ""Rock Me Sexy Jesus"" will probably be reprised in Februarys Oscarcast as an irreverent Best Original Song nominee. Ultimately the film a merciless parody of ""inspirational teacher"" movies becomes oddly uplifting with the sweet innocence of Marschzs artistic vision shining through the God-awful excess of his production. Like the play within the film ""Hamlet 2"" could become a cause celebre in spite of itself.

"Hamlet 2 (R)  | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies Hamlet 2 (R)  Much like the play within it Hamlet 2 is lousy. The main difference is that the play is supposed to be awful. In this image released by Focus Features Steve Coogan left and Skylar Astin perform in a scene from ""Hamlet 2."" Photo Cathy Kanavy. Share Print Save to your profile Much like the play within it Hamlet 2 is lousy. The main difference is that the play is supposed to be awful. The movie about the play is supposed to be funny. But despite the fact that one of its screenwriters is credited with contributing to South Park Bigger Longer amp; Uncut -- probably the greatest if crudest plea for First Amendment freedoms in the history of filmmaking -- Hamlet 2 is a joke waiting for a punchline a painful bore that exists only for a final act thats never quite worth the wait. The film which premiered at Sundance earlier this year centers on monomaniacal Tucson high-school drama teacher Dana Marschz (Steve Coogan) who is about to lose his job and possibly his wife (the wonderfully acerbic Catherine Keener). The clueless Marschz decides to write a masterpiece to save his class a musical sequel to Hamlet that gives Shakespeares most famous tragedy a happy ending and allows him to work through a few of his father issues. The play which also includes a time-traveling Jesus is deemed too offensive by the principal (Marshall Bell) and is promptly canceled. But soon an ACLU lawyer (Amy Poehler) shows up to assure everybody that the show will go on. Coogan is an inventive comedian -- see him in Tristam Shandy and youll have no idea why he bothered with this drivel -- but hes hamstrung by material that prides itself only on its crassness. But aside from one particularly appalling song Hamlet 2 isnt even particularly crude; its barely even subversive. The signature number Rock Me Sexy Jesus is only mildly amusing funnier in concept than execution. Its not even in the same league as a certain unprintably titled song from the South Park movie that makes you laugh every time you hear it. So instead of sharp satire we get Coogan intoning My life is a parody of a tragedy. But the real tragedy here is that someone might actually pay to see this dull mess of a movie.

In Hamlet 2 Dana Marschz (Steve Coogan center) is a high school drama teacher in Tucson Ariz. who writes a sequel to Hamlet. Photo CATHY KANAVY FOCUS FEATURES Hamlet 2 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Dana Marschz is a singular ding-dong. A terrible actor with an unpronounceable name (is it Mars? Marsh? Marjj? Mirage-kuh?) his body of work includes an episode of Xena Warrior Princess an ad for Jack LaLannes Power Juicer and a brief gig as Robin Williams stand-in on Patch Adams. More recently as the drama teacher at West Mesa High in Tucson Ariz. hes been mounting saggy theatrical adaptations of popular films. The latest Erin Brockovich. As usual it gets panned in the student newspaper. Dana (Steve Coogan) confronts its dyspeptic runt of a theater critic (Shea Pepe making a nice dry debut) who suggests looking beyond the multiplex for inspiration. Some other teacher might turn to Pippin. But when the school board cuts funding for the drama club making this trimester his last the determined Mr. Marschz resolves to hunker down and write a sequel to Hamlet -- an irreverent musical revision in which the Prince of Denmark hops a time machine and keeps everyone from croaking at the end. Ophelia Laertes Gertrude Hamlet They all get a second chance at life. ""Youre taking the tragedy out of the tragedy"" complains a parent. But to Danas mind Hamlet 1 is just too depressing. ""Its such a downer"" The first half of Hamlet 2 is not. Credit sharp writing (by Nancy Drews Andy Fleming and South Parks Pam Brady) nutty direction (by Fleming) and an over-the-top booberific performance by Coogan as the strangely loveable Marschz. He can go from orgasmic soliloquizing to blubbering self-pity in Olympic-record time and he can do it while wearing a caftan. Danas eccentricities extend from his career to his home life to his weird fixation on Elizabeth Shue -- who materializes in a few scenes -- and suggest a childlike innocence to offset the complete lack of talent. His wife played by Catherine Keener in one of her nasty phases treats him like dirt. So do most of his students who remain unmoved by misty references to Dangerous Minds Dead Poets Society and other inspirational-teacher movies. Meanwhile the schools jerk principal (Marshall Bell) and various angry parents object to the plays more outre content (which includes a song called Rape Me in the Face) and try to shut it down sparking the interest of an anti-Semitic ACLU lawyer (Amy Poehler). And then an odd thing happens Hamlet 2 becomes an inspirational-teacher movie. It becomes what it mocks the same ironic collapse that afflicts Tropic Thunder. This occurs first of all because comic screenwriting conventions now require a late-act emotional downturn (or ""sag"" as I call it) followed by an inevitably saccharine climax. But it also occurs because Fleming shifts his object of satire from the breathtaking cruddiness of bad art to a much trickier target Christianity. Jesus Christ rides shotgun on Hamlets time machine into the present day where rockabilly singers greet him with a rousing chorus of Rock Me Sexy Jesus -- were told he has a hot swimmers bod. He counsels the suffering Dana to forgive his Dad and then suspended by wires from the ceiling rises toward heaven and forgives his own. Umm no -- thats not in scripture. Even more damning for a satire its not that funny. If youre going to spoof the foundations of a world religion youd darn well better be witty about it or why bother? (See Life of Brian or Mel Brooks History of the World Part I.) Hamlet 2 is plenty humorous when its lampooning Dana but once those protesters arrive it loses its way. The more self-righteous it gets -- the more pious it is about offending people -- the less it works as a theatrical parody. You wont find an ounce of piety in The Producers or Waiting for Guffman and theres a reason why Its deadly stuff. In the end it almost kills Hamlet 2 -- upbeat revisionism or not. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Thruster Mens 700c Fixie Bike for 129 + free shipping Best Buy Clearance amp; Open-Box items Up to 50% off + free...

Or so we shall by the grand finale to Andrew Flemings ""Hamlet 2."" Not to be confused with Hamlet 2.0 which would suggest some 21st-century savvy on the part of struggling actor turned high school drama teacher Dana Marschz. A crowd-pleaser at the Sundance Film Festival this indie comedy is Ham-lite to be sure. At one point Dana bleats his frustration over why the Bards play ends so tragically. He uses his crazed adaptation of ""Hamlet"" to resolve his own paternal conflicts. The odd-funny thing about ""Hamlet 2"" co-written by Fleming and Pam Brady is how so much of it is if not quite tragic bittersweet. It achieves the same effect as many of the movies Dana absurdly references for his new drama students at West Mesa High in Tucson (""Dangerous Minds"" ""Mr. Hollands Opus""). It invites moist eyes. Danas optimism is as desperate as it is deluded. His plays all adaptations of major motion pictures are sparsely attended and routinely panned by a pint-size critic. A meeting with his toughest students parents is amusing because he takes no cues from his surroundings. A new school year brings an influx of Latino students into his drama program which had consisted solely of two eager-to-please students Rand and Epiphany. When his drama program is targeted for budget cuts he decides to put on the best darn play he can. ""What if it sucks?"" he asks Noah Sapperstein (Shea Pepe). ""Isnt that the question every artist must ask himself?"" replies the wisp of a critic. Nearly everyone is smarter and definitely wiser than Dana. The one exception is Principal Rocker (Marshall Bell) who delivers news of the drama programs imminent demise in front of a trophy case sparkling with spoils of phys. ed. Elisabeth Shue appears as herself had she left movies for a more satisfying job nursing. Star-struck Dana goes agog when he meets her at the Prickly Pear Fertility Clinic where he and wife Brie have a follow-up appointment. Catherine Keener is in fine withering form as Brie. Getting soused on a margarita the size of a kiddie pool Brie delivers digs at Dana. Their boarder Gary (David Arquette) looks on a mute well-muscled witness. Bries quips arent the stuff of dreams but of Freud. The same can be said of the titular play that makes the movie soar in surprising goofy ways. Lovers of ""Godspell"" wont find Danas ""Sexy Jesus"" number so very blasphemous. ""Hamlet 2"" is rated R which poses a question that has followed a slew of summer comedies Why so vulgar? If Shakespeare could be ribald if Chaucer could get down and dirty in Middle English and if Delta bluesmen and women could find their nasty groove with toe-curling metaphors why is it so hard for Hollywood writers to create the naughty without resorting to dirt? Amy Poehlers turn as an ACLU lawyer is all very First Amendment. It is also tiresomely crude.

"Hamlet 2 It is not nor it cannot come to good | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsHamlet 2 It is not nor it cannot come to goodIf promotional hype of Falstaffian proportions has you convinced that Hamlet 2 is a Shakespearean romp or a musical involving a rocking sexy deity some elucidation is in order.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Aug. 22 2008 Hamlet 2 (out of 4)Starring Steve Coogan Catherine Keener Elisabeth Shue Amy Poehler and David Arquette. Directed by Andrew Fleming. 94 minutes. At major theatres. 14A If promotional hype of Falstaffian proportions has you convinced that Hamlet 2 is a Shakespearean romp or a musical involving a rocking sexy deity some elucidation is in order.The film is neither of those things much mores the pity although the Bard is invoked and there is a snappy ditty called ""Rock Me Sexy Jesus"" (now playing on a YouTube near you).Something else you should know about Hamlet 2 is that its a Steve Coogan film which means hes inescapable. Theres barely a second that doesnt have his grinning mug in it despite the presence of such strong supporting talent as Catherine Keener Amy Poehler David Arquette and a very game Elisabeth Shue. Good news perhaps for ardent fans of Coogan a smart and usually funny Brit finally getting some serious recognition in North America. But for those of us who prefer his self-mocking humour in smaller doses - such as his cameo role in Tropic Thunder - his relentless ubiquity gets wearisome.This mirrors his dilemma in Hamlet 2 where he plays Dana Marschz an Arizona drama teacher who has outworn his welcome at a Tucson high school. The aptly named Principal Rocker (Marshall Bell) is fed up with Marschzs bizarre stage adaptations of such unlikely movies as Erin Brockovich and Mississippi Burning and hes threatening to cancel the drama program. Marschz previously a failed actor from TV commercials for herpes remedies and juicers barely gets respect from anyone. His wife (Keener) despises him the school papers teen drama critic (Shea Pepe) savagely pans his shows and his class is filled with gangbangers who enrolled for an easy credit - with the exception of the sexually confused Rand (Skylar Astin) and the Bible-thumping Epiphany (Phoebe Strole).The only real talent Marschz possesses is the ability to soldier on convinced of his potential for greatness no matter how many arrows are shot into his hide. He deduces - thanks to that savage teen critic - that originality is lacking in his stagecraft and thus decides to write a sequel to Hamlet. The plays high body count is no impediment for the resourceful Marschz nothing that a time machine and a visit from Jesus couldnt fix.Much of Hamlet 2 the movie then is about the writing and casting of Hamlet 2 the high school musical which is unveiled in the final reel. And as much as you want to tell yourself how funny this idea is it comes across as such only in fits and starts - and mainly from the neglected supporting cast.Coogan seems to be channelling one of Martin Shorts frantic nerd characters in particular the high school drama coach Short played in the little-seen 2001 comedy Get Over It which also had a Shakespeare angle but was a lot funnier than this.The movie does succeed in making us feel sorry for Marschz - but are we really feeling sorry for the character or lamenting how much energy Coogan is expending trying to make him funny?Jokes that must have seemed hilarious on the drawing board such as the running gag over Marschzs unpronounceable surname survive long past their jest-before date. Gags of genuine wit meanwhile such as Keeners scathingly contemptuous wife and Shues real-life portrayal of herself as a disillusioned actor are flattened by Coogans steamroller. Scant guidance is provided by mirth-deficient director Andrew Fleming (who last helmed Nancy Drew) despite the scriptwriting assistance he received from South Park scribe Pam Brady.When Hamlet 2 the play finally hits the boards late in the game the movie picks up needed comic energy. Most of that is due to Poehlers cameo as a civil rights advocate brought in to block killjoys who dont see the art in a time-travelling musical about a sexy rocking Jesus with major daddy issues. Its just as hard to see the comic art in Hamlet 2 the movie or to fathom why Focus Features dropped a startling 10 million at Sundance to acquire it. Could the purchasers have been as deluded as Dana Marschz?The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

ABOUT THE MOVIEHamlet 2  1/2 (out of four)Stars Steve Coogan Catherine Keener David Arquette Amy Poehler Elisabeth ShueDirector Andrew FlemingDistributor Focus FeaturesRating R for language including sexual references brief nudity and some drug contentRunning time1 hour 32 minutesOpens Friday in select cities By Claudia Puig USA TODAY The Bard might be squirming in his grave but not actually turning with Hamlet 2 given that it doesnt quite live up to its eccentrically campy promise. Steve Coogan is sometimes absurdly funny as a delusional drama teacher and tortured artist. And a couple of the production numbers in the redux of the Shakespearean play are crazy clever but the wit is spotty and sporadic. Its sharply funny moments make its lack of consistency all the more evident. The movie ends up feeling like a collection of moments rather than a coherent quirky comedy. CLIP Get a sneak peek at Hamlet 2 Coogan plays wannabe actor/ high school drama teacher Dana Marschz (the pronunciation of which is a recurring joke). His failed attempts at acting are a comic highlight. Catherine Keener plays his unhappy wife Brie who is joined at the hip by their roommate/boarder (David Arquette). Dana considers himself an inspirational teacher and courageous drama impresario. But he quakes in the face of the critical pans of a puny ninth-grade student who gives his plays (including a theatrical version of Erin Brockovich) a series of bad reviews. Dana also is facing the imminent closure of the theater program as his Tucson public high school faces budget cuts. He conceives of a sequel to Hamlet done as musical theater and is convinced of its brilliance. The racy material outrages the school principal and much of the community but Dana thinks he has hit creative pay dirt. As protests mount he gets unexpected support from an ACLU lawyer with the amusing name of Cricket Feldstein (Amy Poehler). Elisabeth Shue has a strange role as a version of herself who has given up acting for nursing. Danas quest for artistic expression is realized during the musical extravaganza with its ridiculously catchy number""Rock Me Sexy Jesus."" This Sundance Film Festival hit is irreverent and occasionally inspired. But the best part is the ambitious production. When it focuses too much on the travails of the high school students he means to guide and mold the movie strays into Dangerous Minds territory and loses its comic punch.

"Movie Review Hamlet 2 - 3 stars out of 5 - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Entertainment Entertainment Movie Review Hamlet 2 - 3 stars out of 5 Roger MooreSentinel Movie Critic Dead Poets Society Dangerous Minds Mr. Hollands Opus all ""great"" movies about ""great"" teachers inspiring their students to achieve great things -- all movies referenced lovingly by Steve Coogans ""inspiring"" teacher in Hamlet 2. All are slandered mercilessly in this demented profanity of a comedy from South Park writer Pam Brady.Hamlet 2 doesnt fall ""trippingly"" off the tongue. A leaden third act almost kills it. But ""the plays the thing"" in this spoof of ""inspiring"" teacher films this satire of Red State attitudes toward the arts. The brilliant Brit-comic Coogan pulls out all the stops and drops all the trousers as Dana Marschz a frustrated never-was whom we meet in a montage of TV herpes commercials and Xena bit parts in the films introduction. Dana has moved to Tucson ""where dreams go to die"" intones the master thespian narrator ( Jeremy Irons).Dana is another version of Corky in Waiting for Guffman the small-time THEA-turr director who turns hit movies (Erin Brockovich Mississippi Burning?) into ""events"" at West Mesa High suffering the slings and arrows of a lisping 15-year-old theater critic. Cutbacks have brought more kids into his drama program taught in the combo theater-and-cafeteria (Snackatorium). But just as hes about to turn this wellspring of new ""ethnic"" talent loose on his dream play a deeply personal deeply misguided time-travel sequel to Hamlet the school board cuts drama.His wife ( Catherine Keener) wants a baby hates having a roommate ( David Arquette) and is not convinced of Danas genius.""I seriously seriously wish youd start drinking again.""And the kids save for the whitebread Dana groupies (Phoebe Strole Skylar Astin)  arent exactly down with the whole project. Danas play is awful in an edgy way. He brings in Einstein and then Jesus -- ""Sexy Jesus."" He writes tunes ""Rock Me Sexy Jesus."" That draws the ire of the school board lets the community shows its intolerant side and catches the interest of a prickly ACLU lawyer ( Amy Poehler scary as ever).Will art transform the kids? Will the play change Tucson? Will Dana finally have his moment in the spotlight? Will the show go on?Director Andrew Fleming did the recent Nancy Drew adaptation and hes an odd choice for a farce Judd Apatow might embrace. Fleming has a hard time keeping up. Coogans Dana imitates scenes from his favorite ""inspiring teacher"" movies to try and reach the kids and injures them. He composes inappropriate tunes even in the lobby of the Prickly Pear Fertility Clinic. Elisabeth Shue shows up playing Elisabeth Shue a nurse at that clinic. Shue says she has given up the acting dream but Dana inspires her.There are so many hilarious blasphemous politically incorrect bits here that Fleming seems at a loss as to how to mold this into the breathless romp its supposed to be. This could have been Pineapple Express with heart a live-action South Park-style send-up.But what we get is funny enough for any Copyright (c) 2016 Orlando Sentinel Entertainment Cartoons Movies Arts and Culture Death Literature Health Pulse ShootingAll SectionsNewsSportsBusinessClassifiedEntertainmentTravel76deg","http://www.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment/movies/orl-hamlet-2-movie-review-roger-moore,0,7573838.story",200,hamlet224,hamlet2,orlandosentinel

At Tucsons West Mesa High Danas drama-class adaptations of inspirational movies are less distinguished even than his wincingly bad turns in infomercials. With marriage and job on the line Dana (nimble Brit joker Steve Coogan) improvises one last time He will stage a multimedia multiculti multi-untalented sequel to the Bards great drama in which everybody dies. This time everybody lives. Cue chorus to sing ""Rock Me Sexy Jesus."" Cue audience to howl at the so-bad-its-good spectacle. Alas in Andrew Flemings Hamlet 2 the laughs are wan and intermittent. Theres something rotten in the state of Arizona. A slapstick figure here and in Tropic Thunder (as the British director of the film-within-the-film) Coogan is obviously drawn to showbiz satire where the characters only frame of reference is showbiz. Which might explain why so many of the inside jokes in Hamlet 2 convulse the actors more than they do their audience. Coogan is a resourceful comedian whose offbeat drollery gave Tristram Shandy and Happy Endings their surprising rhythms. Fleming who made the underrated Dick and Nancy Drew elicits a generic performance from Coogan so desperate for laughs that he punctuates punchlines with pratfalls. Not only Coogans performance but everything else about Flemings film is insistent to the point of numbness. Nothing kills comedy quicker than the nudge-nudge wink-wink overplaying here. Hard to tell whether Fleming who cowrote the screenplay with Pam Brady has come to satirically bury the inspirational teachers of the Dangerous Minds/Dead Poets Society school or to praise them. Only in its aggressively imaginative profanity is the film consistent. Apart from David Arquette Catherine Keener and Elisabeth Shue none of whom is given much to do in this Coogan-centric comedy the cast includes talented young players Marshall Bell Melonie Diaz and Phoebe Strole.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

Email Print Share Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Del.i.cious Google+ Reprints Follow TIME Theres nothing remarkable or witty or particularly engaging about Hamlet 2 a ragged comedy about a failed actor who tries to mount a science-fiction musical sequel to Shakespeares tragedy in a Tucson Ariz. high school. But at the movies damp little heart there is a poignant truth all actors desperate neediness to win the appreciation and approval of the audience which is anyone they meet. All of life is a war for that attention in which the armaments are charm beauty and menace the battle cry is ""Look at me"" and the secret weapon is the onlookers pity. The actor in question is Dana Marschz -- his last name is nearly unpronounceable just the first reason he has trouble getting jobs -- and he is played by the English comedian Steve Coogan with the lank hair toothy smile and blithe sweetness that recall Tiny Tim the eccentric ukuleleist of the 60s. Coogan has been everywhere lately starring in little movies (A Cock and Bull Story Tristram Shandy) and guesting in bigger ones. He had a brief explosive turn as the director in Tropic Thunder and hes popped up in Finding Amanda Hot Fuzz Marie Antoinette Night at the Museum and dozens more. Either hes much in demand or his agent has been instructed never to turn down an offer. At any rate hes the kind of highly employable performer Dana dreams of being. Coogans signature character displayed in a decades worth of Brit comedy series is Alan Partridge an unctuously brutal TV host modeled on David Frost. (Eric Idle did Frost first and better back on Monty Pythons Flying Circus.) If youve never seen Partridge you know his type from countless American movies and TV shows a star with a self-confidence as unbreakable as it is unjustified and whos impervious to the worlds opinion of him. Dana to whom Coogan gives full emotional value is the flip side of that showbiz coin. Hes lost so many auditions been told no so many times that his actors ego exists only on the memory of what he once hoped to be. But that memory is strong enough to keep him going. Acting is no longer what he does; its what he is. Hes the slave of his abiding addiction for approval despite the daily hourly minute-ly blows to his self-esteem. He gets plenty of buffeting at the high school where he teaches drama. Hes adored by two misfit students the gushing Epiphany Sellars (Phoebe Strobe) and the not-yet-aware-of-his-own-gayness Rand Posin (Skylar Astin). The other kids including a bunch of Latinos bused in from another school treat Dana with loud contempt and the principal is ready and eager to close down the Drama Department i.e. Dana. His grand idea has been to stage productions of old hit movies -- Erin Brockovich played by teens -- which are routinely panned by the local critic another student at the school. No one cares for him including his wife Brie (Catherine Keener in another of those roles that require her to do no more than laugh a lot at the heros inadequacies). The mechanics of Danas despair and salvation are managed with no special grace by writers Andrew Fleming and Pam Brady and haphazardly directed by Fleming. Hes done wan remakes of The In-laws and Nancy Drew but the film closest to Hamlet 2 was the 1999 comedy Dick which enlisted a slew of Saturday Night Live veterans (Will Ferrell Harry Shearer Ana Gasteyer Jim Breuer) in the fanciful tale of two girls (Kirsten Dunst and Michelle Williams) who wander off from a White House tour and get entangled with President Nixon. That one sounded funnier than it was too. A few early reviews of Hamlet 2 make it seem like a wild anarchic satire. It is nothing of the sort. Its a standard-issue parody of the inspirational-teacher movies that bloomed in the 90s (with Mr. Hollands Opus and Dangerous Minds) and show no signs of going away. Satires aim is to cleanse by annihilating; thats what Dr. Strangelove and other black comedies of the 60s did. But genuine satire is hard to find on the big screen these days or any day because its strident moralist tone tends to alienate audiences. In the definition of the form by Broadway writer-director George S. Kaufman ""Satire is what closes on Saturday night."" Empty movie houses are no spur to getting a movie financed so would-be satires cop out by the final reel and become the thing they started to mock. Tropic Thunder devolves from a Hollywood diatribe in which all the participants are greedy or loony into Rambo VII or a peppier Platoon. And Hamlet 2 turns into an MGM musical with Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland where the kids put on the big show in a barn -- here a warehouse. Instead of scorched-earth satire this is parody plain and simple especially simple. It has no greater intent than to tease and cuddle up. Movies today whether comedies or dramas are proud of having renounced the piety of old Hollywood. Yet however strong their bite or bitter their first taste theyre afraid to let the moviegoer leave with a dark thought in his mind; they require happy endings. Thats one reason the typical modern movie is no more advanced than the sentimental antiques of Hollywoods Golden Age -- and why Hamlet 2 is as needy as its hero -- because it wants not to be probing or profound or even witty but above all else to be loved.

It does. Steve Coogan who stars as Dana Marschz a desperate failed actor turned drama teacher who writes a sequel to Shakespeares classic tragedy never lets up whether his character experiences amped-up enthusiasm or despondency (he spends a lot of time bouncing between the two). Its a fantastic performance but the supporting cast is equally committed which goes a long way toward making prickly characters sympathetic or something like it. The always-reliable Catherine Keener for instance plays Danas wife Brie self-involved with a shrewish streak yet you like her anyway because she never loses focus on whats important to her herself. Phoebe Stroles Epiphany Sellars a religious drama student is casually racist by way of sheltered ignorance but hilarious as she learns to love the thug life. And Elisabeth Shue shines while playing a somewhat lesser version of . . . Elisabeth Shue never straying from the self-deprecation required to land her in Tucson as a nurse sick of the acting business. That level of wacked-out intensity is crucial to the success of the movie because although frequently laugh-out-loud funny Hamlet 2 is enough of a hit-and-miss affair that it requires the confidence that another bizarre moment - Amy Poehler as a profane ACLU lawyer for instance - is right around the corner. And happily it always is. Marschz went into acting to work out issues with his father with little success (we see a sampling of his work at the beginning of the film). He winds up in Tucson (""where dreams go to die"") teaching high-school drama. In a typical school year he has only two students Epiphany and the closeted Rand (Skylar Astin) who perform two-person versions of such popular films as Erin Brockovich. Asbestos in classroom ceilings results in the class swelling to many more students mostly Latino kids who have little interest in drama and less in Marschz. Marschz with the self-confidence of the truly delusional is nearly blind to their indifference. Life at home is rocky as well - much to Bries displeasure theyve had to take in a boarder (David Arquette) to make ends meet. And Marschz seems unable to get Brie pregnant. Then the unkindest cut The school principal (Marshall Bell) tells Marschz that the school board has decided to cut drama. Panicked trying to save the program and impress the ninth-grade drama critic who torments him Marschz decides to stage his own composition - Hamlet 2. Wait Brie points out didnt just about everyone die in the end of the original? In typical fashion Marschz sees a solution ""I have a device."" That device is a time machine which Hamlet will use to prevent all those messy deaths that make the play so great (again not concerned). And he will bring along his pal Jesus. Its a measure of Marschzs ridiculously self-centered commitment that he begins referring to Hamlet as Hamlet 1. Word of the play gets out and results in an uproar of course as well it might - one of the big production numbers is Rock Me Sexy Jesus which includes Jesus (with the ""sexy swimmer bod"") moonwalking on water. The entire production basically an excuse for Marschz to work out his daddy issues is gleefully offensive yet somehow sort of winning in spite of itself. Hamlet 2s story is as old and cliched as any ""lets-put-on-a-show"" movie - of course there are more layers to the seemingly dangerous Octavio (Joseph Julian Soria) for instance. Its the telling of the story thats so demented so twisted so funny. ""The plays the thing"" as our man Hamlet (in 1) says. And in Hamlet 2 its also a funny thing.

Hoberman Childhood In Mommas Man; Struggles With Daddy Issues In Hamlet 2 Tuesday August 19 2008 at 4 a.m. By J. Hoberman 1 Matt Boren and Flo Jacobs hug it out.Kino International A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Thirtyish guy--bit of a schlub but married with a newborn baby--comes back from California to visit aging parents in New York and overtaken by a mysterious lethargy moves into his tiny childhood room. Mommas Man directed by Azazel Jacobs from his own screenplay is one of the sweetest saddest stories Franz Kafka never wrote.That Mikey (Matt Boren) grew up in a pre-gentrification tin-ceilinged wooden-floored lower-Manhattan loft with parents who were unreconstructed Jewish bohemians gives Mommas Man more than a dollop of local color; that Mikeys parents are played by the filmmakers own the artists Ken and Flo Jacobs and the loft is the place where he actually grew up provides Mommas Man with considerable emotional resonance. At least for me.Full disclosure Although my most vivid memories of Aza Jacobs are as the unnamed infant installed in a crib in a Johnson City apartment and called for what seemed like a very long time ""Mr. Baby"" Ive known his parents for nearly 40 years going back to my undergraduate days at the State University of Binghamton where Ken Jacobs impressed me as possibly the most brilliant film teacher in the world.Im also familiar with the Mommas Man milieu specifically the Jacobs loft--a fantastic assemblage of suspended bicycles hanging chairs film cans wind-up toys and philosophical machines that--part studio part archive--has struck more than one viewer as a character in the movie. And so while I cannot evaluate Mommas Man with an outsiders clarity I can vouch for the authenticity of its location (fascinatingly defamiliarized) as well as the uncanny naturalism (and fond exaggeration) with which Ken and Flo are written Dad savoring a strange piece of music and propped up in bed relaxing with a book called American Fascists; Mom questioning Dads characterization of his work as ""painting"" and offering Mikey a ""little bit of brownie.""Aza Jacobs isnt the first filmmaker to direct his parents. John Hustons father Walter had a major role in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre; Zoe Cassavetes and her brother Nick have each directed their mother Gena Rowlands; Martin Scorsese made a documentary about his parents and regularly gave them cameos. Plenty of people base films on family history but so far as I know Mommas Man is alone in approaching psychodrama by having the parents play themselves. And while many avant-garde filmmakers have made movies about their children the younger Jacobs is the first of these kids to turn the camera on Dad in a feature-length narrative.Mommas Man is highly specific evoking not only the filmmakers lost childhood but also the heroic New York art scene that had already begun to fade when the now 35-year-old Azazel Jacobs was a boy. But it is even more powerfully universal. Much comic pathos arises from the realization that Mikey has no perspective on his parents. They are as mysterious in their idiosyncrasies as anyones. (And with his doughy physique and placid moon face Boren gives the impression of an eternal child if not one produced by this particular Mom and Dad.) Mikeys prolonged visit is not so much a regression as a blissful immersion in some pre-analytical Eden. Cluttered with charged objects the magic loft is in itself an image of childhood. Mikey raptly rummages through his stuff finding a costume cape some angst-ridden teenage letters and an old guitar. Quietly he sings one of his high-school songs ""Fuck fuck fuck you--hope you die too.""From the movies first shot--a tight close-up of Mikey and Moms interlocked hands--Mommas Man radiates unconditional affection. Unlike the Albert Brooks character in Brookss not dissimilar Mother Mikey doesnt have to struggle for parental love. On the contrary hes helpless in the face of their concern. More touching than Mikeys attachment to his parents is the degree to which they bask in his pudgy presence and against all reason yearn for him to stay in their world. The key image has all three lying in bed raptly watching an old movie on TV. (In a sinister joke it seems to be Chaplins comedy of murder Monsieur Verdoux.)Bumped from his return flight Mikey is initially confounded by airline bureaucracy. Soon however he is inventing reasons to stay in this nutty paradise. He ignores the increasingly desperate messages left by his abandoned wife (Dana Varon) preferring to sit in wintry Hudson River Park or lie on his narrow little bed in his semi-private corner of the loft reading comic books warding off dread and letting his beard grow. Dad tries to amuse him by playing an old 78 (""Crazy Blues"") or demonstrating a new crawling toy purchased in Chinatown. Few things in the movie are funnier than Dads expectant smile and Mikeys blank-faced appreciation; nothing is more poignant than Moms heartfelt assurance ""You can stay here as long as you want.""A bid for Kafkaesque happiness? Underscored by Mandy Hoffmans pensive dryly whimsical piano compositions Mikeys breakdown has the quality of a wistful nightmare. Space is elusive. The loft seems at once vast and claustrophobic and although the viewer is treated to many slow pans its geography is never clear. Mikey is forever spotting portents in the clutter or receiving mysterious bulletins (from the TV the cell phone and his own unconscious). In one unsuccessful attempt to leave the loft he waits until his parents are asleep; perhaps theyll think they only imagined his visit.Late in the movie the filmmaker suggests that this childs dream is in fact a childhood dream. In a haunting bit of ancient footage the actual little Azazel is seated at the same round wooden table that functions as the lofts fulcrum head down asleep beside an unfinished plate of spaghetti.Like Mommas Man Hamlet 2 concerns a childish mans struggle with adult responsibility and as its title suggests also a sons relation to his father. Not nearly as uproarious as it should be Andrew Flemings latest high-school farce premiered at the same Sundance Film Festival where Mommas Man made its debut and after a spirited bidding war was sold for a cool 10 million.The movie which Fleming wrote with South Park veteran Pam Brady is a sort of backstage Bad News Bears in which a beleaguered high-school drama teacher (Steve Coogan) attempts to save his job by staging a musical sequel to the most famous play in the English language. (To add to the fun his class is heavily salted with lovable mainly Latino gangbangers.) One of the funniest men in England Coogan here plays American--which is to say he projects his character as a sincere idiot. Coogan will do anything for a laugh and given how little he has to work with he must. Its impressive that he can fill the screen though hes still regularly upstaged by Catherine Keener in her specialty role as castrating spouse never more inspired than when playing a scene with a margarita as big as a birdbath.Perhaps because it deals with the anxiety of influence Hamlet 2 is surprisingly sympathetic to writers ""Oh my God--writing is so hard"" Coogan exclaims at the word processor. He accepts advice from a 12-year-old drama critic and in the grand finale is saved by the national press which rallies around the production as a free-speech issue. Not exactly Springtime for Hitler the climactic musical features a ""Raped in the Face"" number and a familiar-seeming ""Rock Me Sexy Jesus"" routine in which a beatific be-fright-wigged Coogan descends from the ceiling to intone ""Father I forgive you."" We know that the now-liberated actor is actually talking about his earthly dad. The show ends with Coogan still suspended in the air--not unlike the movie which not quite a parody is something like a failed metaphor for itself.

"Hamlet 2 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; hamlet-2 ) Hamlet 2 (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli Hamlet 2 (a great title) does not represent the first time in recent years that something unconventional has been done to one of the Bards classics. (Although to be sure no one has been as audacious as to develop a musical sequel to a play.) Scotland PA re-imagined Macbeth as a modern-day comedy. In A Midwinters Tale Kenneth Branagh developed a comedy centered on an amateur production of Hamlet. Years later Branagh elected to adapt Loves Labours Lost as a musical using established standards. Aspects of all these productions can be found in Hamlet 2 not to mention swatches of Mel Brooks The Producers and Christopher Guests Waiting for Guffman. Despite the richness of the premise for comic invention however Hamlet 2 remains a rather mediocre experience offering sporadic laughs but never achieving the level of consistent humor necessary to make this memorable. Dana Marschz (Steve Coogan) is a drama teacher at a Tucson high school. Outside of a couple of overeager teachers pets his class is filled with kids who would rather be anywhere except in school. Taking his cues from Dangerous Minds Mr. Hollands Opus and Dead Poets Society Dana decides to change the lives of his students. To accomplish this he casts them in a play of his own devising Hamlet 2 the musical ""sequel"" to Shakespeares masterpiece. For the lead he chooses the most dangerous of his students Octavio (Joseph Julian Soria) who is also the most talented. However as word gets out about what hes doing the principal decides to step in and put an end to the production. Enter Cricket Feldstein (Amy Poehler) an ACLU lawyer who takes up Danas cause. Meanwhile at home the teacher is involved in a little domestic drama his wife Brie (Catherine Keener) is tired of her inability to conceive and drags Dana to a fertility clinic. Like the play in The Producers Hamlet 2 is intended to be woeful. It even has its own version of ""Springtime for Hitler"" ""Rock Me Sexy Jesus."" The premise of the play is straightforward Hamlet gets his hands on a time machine and accompanied by Jesus spends some time in the modern world before traveling back to save Ophelia Gertrude and Laertes from death. When a literature professor questions why Dana would remove all the tragedy from one of the worlds greatest tragedies he responds that the characters deserve happy endings. In that way Hamlet 2 is able to comment (none-too-subtly) on Hollywoods distaste for ""downer"" endings. The comedy in Hamlet 2 is uneven. Some scenes and performances cull laughter; others fall flat. The story as a whole with its dull parody of the ""teacher saves his students"" staple feels overlong. Steve Coogan brings a restless manic quality to Dana but its as often irritating as it is amusing. (Hes highly reminiscent of Eric Idle.) The two best comedic turns belong to Amy Poehler and Catherine Keener both of whom find the right groove for their characters and have the best lines. The most underused actress is Elisabeth Shue playing a caricature of herself as a washed-up actress who disillusioned with the business has become a nurse. Shue gamely participates in an act of self-deprecation but hilarious possibilities with this character arent realized. The best things about Hamlet 2 are the most offbeat. Those who sense the occasional flavor of South Park are not deceived director Andrew Flemings co-writer Pam Brady is a South Park alum. The move opens with parodies of TV commercials illustrating Danas lack of success as an actor. Theres a short but funny scene where he interacts with a cat while straining to write Hamlet 2. A montage is set to a rendition of ""Maniac"" as performed by the Tucson Gay Chorus (they later also sing ""Someone Saved My Life Tonight""). Moments like these save Hamlet 2 from becoming a bore but they dont make it worth paying a full admission for. The film was purchased for 10 million out of Sundance by Focus Features and will likely become another instance of something that looked better in the rarefied January atmosphere of Park City than it will look in local multiplexes around the country in the mugginess of late August.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Hope Floats The miraculous Katrina documentary Trouble the Water. Plus The Rocker never quite rocks. By David Edelstein Published Aug 15 2008 ShareThis (Photo Courtesy of Zeitgeist Films) Kimberly Roberts lost her mother to AIDS when she was 13; lived on the street; sold cocaine; straightened out her life; married an addict (now clean) whose face shed slashed with a razor blade; wrote vivid rap songs about all shed survived; and wound up residing in New Orleans predominantly African-American Ninth Wardwhere on August 29 2005 she turned her camcorder on marooned friends and relatives when Katrina smashed into the city and the levees buckled. Her shaky footage is the centerpiece of Tia Lessin and Carl Deals Trouble the Water and seen through her eyesthose of a person whod gone from chaos and nihilism to faiththe catastrophe and the impulse to document it seems especially heroic. As her family huddles in an attic with a view of the water rushing through the streets higher than the stop signs pouring into houses of people fighting the current to keep from going under with 911 operators telling her theres no one coming to the rescue at this time the film is at once infuriating and affirming. No matter how bland the bureaucratese in the disasters aftermath what happened to Kimberly Roberts and her husband Scott and her drowned uncle and her hospitalized grandmother left to die is right there on the screenalways in the present tense. Lessin and Deal met Kimberly and Scott after the couple had managed to make it to safety and the film theyve woven around her first-person footage provides the bitter political context the mayor unconcerned as the storm approaches about the lack of public transportation; the dissembling president (I dont think anybody anticipated the breach of the levees); the stunned FEMA appointee heckuva-job Michael Brown. There is simply no one from the government there as the water rises and those who areofficers at a naval base blocks awaytrain their guns on a crowd in desperate search of shelter. The filmmakers cut back and forth between those last days of August and the couples return two weeks later to their devastated neighborhood where they find a decomposing relative and amid carcasses of dogs their own pets alive and frisky and destined to be shot by National Guardsmen for reasons unspecified. The Robertses ruminate bitterly on a country that directs its vast resources elsewhereto Iraq for examplebut always end their exchanges with praise for the soldiers good works and thanks to God. As someone of bounteous hope but little (formal) faith I found Kimberlys religious ejaculations a bit trying. She and her husband trek north to a relatives house in which theres no water and when a man shows up to turn it on she exclaims When you trust in God he sends miracles your way Five minutes later the man returns now ordered to shut the water off and this time God goes pointedly unmentioned. But I admit that my perspective is that of a privileged New Yorker who has never had to summon comparable spiritual resources. Whatever sparked and has sustained Kimberlys resolve is indeed a kind of miracle. The rap that she performs for the camera Amazing is just that an explicit (and profane) account of her sordid past capped with an irresistibly upbeat refraina potential smash. That faith brings her and her husband back to New Orleans despite continued government neglecteven as New Orleans pours its resources into luring tourists back to the French Quarter. In one scene Kimberly and fellow refugees line up for FEMA assistance at some kind of ranch where a sign overhead points to Gate BCATTLE ENTRANCE. You cant make this stuff up. You can however capture it on film for all time. Trouble the Water is ineradicably moving. Why cant Americans make comedies as playful but serious as Jiri Menzels I Served the King of England (opening August 29) based on a book by the great Czech satirist Bohumil Hrabal? Is it because we cant stand the thought of a hero who is at once indifferent to politics and entirely shaped by them? Jan Ditte (Oldrich Kaiser) emerges from a Czech prison after nearly fifteen years and is exiled to an abandoned villageonce occupied by Germanson the border. As he mulls over his life we see flashbacks of him as a slight Chaplinesque fellow (Ivan Barnev) who wants only to be rich and manages to accommodate himself to all sorts of peoplegenerals kings industrialists and eventually the invading Nazis. The flashbacks are in the style of silent comedy their magical naivete at odds with Dittes cynical view of human nature and the encroaching horror of Nazism. Menzels touch is sprightly lyrical mischievously understatedhis hero neither good nor evil but blessed (and cursed) by tunnel vision. How could he have guessed what the Commies would make of his wealthor that bad luck would be his redemption? Most mainstream American comedies these days are satires not of real life but of film genrestwo giant steps removed from the world. The newest specimens Hamlet 2 and The Rocker are decent late-August time killers made inconsequential by their facetiousness. The first is a fable of a failed actor (Steve Coogan) who becomes a failed high-school drama teacher and has his faith restored by a class of (initially) uncooperative ethnic minoritiesa parody of Dangerous Minds. Ive always had a soft spot for Andrew Fleming (Dick) whose rhythms are less pushy than other American comedy directors sometimes winningly sometimes to the point of flaccidity. This one is on the limp side but gets points for weirdness. Coogans mopiness is oddly riveting. And the inspirational climax a musical extravaganza in which Hamlet goes through a portal in time and joins forces with Jesus is so god-awful it is very nearly inspired. With a half-decent climax the go-for-it parody The Rocker would have been pretty good bordering on good instead of just okay. Its appeal rests on Rainn Wilson of NBCs The Office a large misshapen fellow whose features swim in the middle of his big face and whose movements are the opposite of fluid. He plays Fish a drummer unjustly chucked out of a heavy-metal band that went on to superstardom who now has another shot with a group of high-school kids. I liked a lot of The Rocker (Christina Applegate as the mother of the groups lead singer is blessedly grounded) but its depressing when the best thing you can say about a comedy is that its second-rateness is pleasantly in sync with its unmagnetic hero.

You can almost hear the hilarity that must have erupted at the pitch meetings while watching ""Hamlet 2"" a comedy with a lot of great-in-description ideas that play about half as funny onscreen. Amusing but unevenly inspired tale of a deluded high school drama teachers attempt to stage a career-saving extravaganza has some laughs to be sure. But its anyones guess whether the 10 million Focus Features dropped for worldwide rights at Sundance will turn out to be a sound investment or another case of ""Happy Texas""-style festival fever overestimating a pics broader appeal. Things start brightly with clips from the highlights in unpronounceably surnamed Dana Marschzs (Steve Coogan) professional acting career notably commercials for Jack La Lannes Power Juicer and herpes medication. Flash forward to the present in which hes given up the tinsel of Hollywood to teach drama at Tucsons West Mesa High. His best students (OK his only students) closeted gay Rand (Skylar Astin) and Christian proselytizer Epiphany (Phoebe Strole) are starring in Marschzs latest biannual school play this one a stage version of ""Erin Brockovich."" Next day the reviews come in bringing another scathing notice from the school papers critic (Shea Pepe) who looks all of 13 years old. Still his judgment is pithy. When the fall brings word that budget cuts will soon eliminate drama from the curriculum entirely the critic recommends Marschz try creating something original rather than awkwardly transferring yet another popular movie to the boards. The new semester also brings a surprising surge of enrollees if only because classes held in asbestos-laden portable classrooms have been canceled and drama is one of the few electives left. As a result white-bread Rand and Epiphany are suddenly swamped by a rowdy group of Latino and Latina ""gangbangers"" (or so Marschz and his pets assume). Once their initial disinterest is somewhat overcome Marschz discovers an acting natural in the hitherto hostile Haywood (as in Jablowme) aka Octavio (Joseph Julian Soria) casting him as Hamlet. This sequel wont be wasting any time on soliloquies -- here Hamlet uses a time machine to reverse the deaths incurred in Shakespeares ""bummer"" original. It also features appearances by Hillary Clinton Einstein and others not to mention Jesus Christ (played by Marschz himself) moonwalking on water in the production number ""Rock Me Sexy Jesus"" accompanied by a Tucson gay mens chorus. Once word gets out Principal Rocker (Marshall Bell) then the whole community wants to pull plug. Smelling a freedom-of-speech struggle the ACLU dispatches legal zealot Cricket Feldstein (Amy Poehler) to see that the show goes on. It does -- and if not as intentionally funny as say the Broadway opening-night climax of ""Stayin Alive"" was unintentionally so the ""Hamlet 2"" within ""Hamlet 2"" proves a colorful exercise in multimedia bad taste. Talented Brit thesp Coogan is given a little too much rope here while conversely some estimable supporting players are given short shrift. Catherine Keener does nail bilious laughs as Marschzs mate thesps most acidly fed-up wife since ""Your Friends and Neighbors"" (in which her husband was also a drama teacher). But casting a game Elisabeth Shue as ""Elisabeth Shue"" (whos given up acting to be a Tucson nurse) is an idea that promises more than is delivered. David Arquette is barely utilized as the couples not-especially-welcome boarder. Slickly handled on a reported 9 million budget pic reps an uptick from helmer Andrew Flemings last bigscreen effort the widely dismissed ""Nancy Drew"" though as cheeky farce its nowhere near the standard of his underappreciated 1999 Watergate spoof ""Dick."" Script co-written with Pam Brady is hit-and-miss in terms of verbal wit and individual gags. But package moves along quickly and overall concept remains amusing even when theres a dud moment or three. Hamlet 2ProductionA Focus Features release of an L+E Pictures production.
