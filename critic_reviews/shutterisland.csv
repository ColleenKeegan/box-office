Robert Cargill 02/19/2010 Starring Leonardo DiCaprio and set in the 1950s this is the story of two federal marshals called in to investigate the disappearance of an inmate from the mysterious island prison Shutter Island. A maximum security prison for the clinically insane Shutter Island is home to the most dangerous deluded and unstable prisoners in the penal system -- tended to by a cadre of doctors working to treat their illness as an illness rather than simply throwing them in a hole as we had done previously. But when one of the prisoners disappears from inside a locked room they have no recourse but to call in the feds. Enter Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio) and his partner (played brilliantly byMark Ruffalo). What follows is a brilliantly constructed mystery as Teddy interviews the staff collects clues and begins to unravel a network of lies and conspiracy that might just reach higher than his pay grade. Unlike what early trailers suggested this isnt some sort of supernatural thriller. It is a good old-fashioned detective story with some pretty bold twists. And while the story (based on a novel of the same name written by Dennis Lahane author of Mystic River and Gone Baby Gone) isnt the most original Scorseses signature filmmaking style takes this to a new level and ultimately makes this the very best version of this story youve ever seen. The acting here is incredible. DiCaprio and Ruffalo lead a tremendous cast and each actor is given their moment in the sun. Ben Kingsley plays the kind head of the institution Dr. Cawley who may or may not be keeping very valuable information from the visiting investigators. Max von Sydow is a co-worker who seems even more sinister than Kingsley might be. Complementing the doctors is a bevy of Oscar caliber talent including Jackie Earle Haley Emily Mortimer and Elias Koteas as inmates; Patricia Clarkson and Ted Levine as other staff members; and Michelle Williams as DiCaprios deceased wife. Together this cast proves to be one of the greatest ensembles in recent years each giving their best and crafting something the Oscars definitely wont be ignoring next year. But most powerful of all is the films ending a stunning heartbreaking climax that plumbs the deep dark depths of DiCaprios character and offers up one of the best finales in a long while. It is not the type of ending youre used to seeing. Instead it is the type of ending we used to see. The film is brilliant an elegantly told tale that generates real suspense creates authentic mood and will keep you on the edge of your seat for the better part of two hours. It is not the gimmicky twist-reliant film it might appear to be. Despite the fact that you might solve its mystery early on you will still find yourself wrapped up in the wonderful characters disturbing pathos and taut pacing all of which youve come to expect from someone like Martin Scorsese.

Everyone involved in Shutter Island - most obviously director Martin Scorsese and star Leonardo DiCaprio - seem to be taking this berserk meandering story absolutely seriously which only serves to make an already fun psychological thriller all the more ludicrous and entertaining.The film is set in 1954. DiCaprio plays Teddy Daniels a US marshal dispatched to the titular oceanbound asylum to investigate the disappearance of a criminally insane inmate from her locked cell. He soon begins to suspect that this remote facility isnt all it appears - is Ben Kingsleys avuncular psychiatrist really as kindly and welfare-conscious as he seems? Why are the guards so heavily armed? And whats with the mysterious lighthouse that all the patients seem so terrified of? To make matters worse theres a hurricane coming in the generators are on the blink and Teddys new partner Chuck (Mark Ruffalo) is starting to look decidedly shifty. Taxi Driver this aint.Actually the Scorsese movie it most resembles is his previous exercise in Hitchcockian overkill 1991s Cape Fear. With DiCaprio rather limp and forgettable in the lead Shutter Island lacks the centrifugal might of De Niros powerhouse central performance in the earlier film. But it compensates with pure visual aural  and narrative excess this is modern gothic taken to its (il)logical extreme a work of pure operatic delirium. The closest Shutter Island gets to a commanding De Niro-like presence might be its perverse overbearing soundtrack a selection of the most doom-laden pieces by modern composers ranging from Kryzstof Penderecki to Max Richter. Every twist in the tale is accompanied by a frenzied flurry of violins every moment of violence underscored by a pounding atonal piano crescendo.While the narrative adapted from Dennis Lehanes 2003 novel is hopelessly convoluted the film is held together by the sheer bludgeoning force of Scorseses directorial vision. Never one to shy away from visual overindulgence Scorsese has used Shutter Island as an excuse to really throw open his box of tricks chucking in gaudy but strikingly beautiful dream sequences harrowing (if rather tasteless) concentration camp flashbacks and the most thunderous howling rainstorms this side of Suspiria. In fact Argentos film a similarly monumental and manic triumph of style over substance may be the most appropriate comparison here. And while Scorsese may lack the giallo masters manic invention the tension between his natural tendency towards old-fashioned Hollywood classicism and his evident desire to cut loose gives the film its strange irrestistible power. As senseless perverse and unwieldy as it undoubtedly is Shutter Island might be Scorseses most enjoyable film in a decade.

By Peter Rainer Film critic February 19 2010 Save for later Saved Actors Ben Kingsley Mark Ruffalo and Leonardo DiCaprio appear in a scene from the Martin Scorsese film Shutter Island. Concorde Filmverleih 2009/Andrew/Handout/REUTERS          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Martin Scorseses ""Shutter Island"" is a pretty terrible movie but I cant just leave it at that. Its the kind of bad movie only very talented people could make and that gives it a fascination. I watched it in a state of rapt bewilderment.Leonardo DiCaprio who has made almost as many movies by now with Scorsese as Robert De Niro plays US Marshal Teddy Daniels who with his new partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) is summoned to the forbidding totally isolated Shutter Island to investigate the disappearance of a mental patient and murderess from the Ashecliffe psychiatric hospital. The time is cold-war-era 1954 which only adds to the already paranoid atmosphere. Zombiefied patients eyeball the marshals with blank fury; doctors in residence including the elegant Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) and the German-accented Dr. Naehring (Max von Sydow) seem by turns accommodating and sinister. Nothing is what it seems on this island except maybe the weather which kicks into Gothic hurricane mode halfway through. To an even greater extent than Quentin Tarantino Scorsese is our leading film director-as-archivist. His movies are riddled with oddments and swipes and homages from the entire history of film and none more so than ""Shutter Island"" (which screenwriter Laeta Kalogridis adapted from Dennis Lehanes 2003 bestseller). Its fun in a film-school kind of way to pick out the references ""Out of the Past"" ""Laura"" ""Isle of the Dead"" and so forth. And yet no one but Scorsese could have made this film. For one thing no one else could so obsessively have bound all these movie references together. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? But the question I kept asking myself throughout this overlong movie is Why bother? Scorsese has made many movies in many modes from ""Raging Bull"" to ""Age of Innocence"" and he deserves as much as any filmmaker alive the right to punch out a commercial project. But ""Shutter Island"" isnt as strictly commercial as say the egregious ""Cape Fear."" Even though Scorsese tricks the movie up with all manner of old-school frights complete with buckets of blood and doomy music on the soundtrack hes more ambitious than that. He wants to create a madmans universe patterned not only on cold-war creepies like ""Shock Corridor"" but also on German Expressionist classics like ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari."" He wants to show us how the tactics of horror schlockmeisters can give rise to art. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? The problem is that Scorsese is more keyed into the schlock than the art. ""Shutter Island"" would have been better if it was less ambitious less adorned with history-of-film pyrotechnics. The story line is replete with switcheroos and double whammies and flashbacks and fantasias and some of the game playing is ingenious and scary but ultimately this is a puzzle movie trying to be grand opera. The actors try their best to fit into this maelstrom. Kingsley and Von Sydow come off best perhaps because their roles are the most clearly demarcated. Patricia Clarkson Emily Mortimer and Jackie Earle Haley give it their bughouse best. DiCaprio whose character is racked by memories of liberating Dachau as a soldier and the horrifying demise of his wife (Michelle Williams) seems too callow - although the miscasting here isnt as startling as it was in Scorseses ""The Aviator"" where DiCaprios Howard Hughes seemed barely old enough to shave. Ruffalo is adept but somewhat recessive. On a second viewing of this film after its mysteries are revealed his performance probably makes more sense. But who would want to see ""Shutter Island"" twice?Scorsese has made some of the best horror films of the modern era but their horror as in ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Raging Bull"" is all psychological. ""Shutter Island"" is ultimately a psychological horror film too but you have to slog through an awful lot of loony-bin stylistics to get much out of it. It comes on strong but in its bloody heart of hearts its no more resonant than one of those old Vincent Price-Edgar Allan Poe contraptions - and less entertaining too.

By Anthony Lane Leonardo DiCaprio and Ben Kingsley in Martin Scorseses new movie.   Credit Illustration by Andy Friedman Rats Rain Lightning Lunatics Mausoleums Migraines Creepy German scientists Nobody could accuse Martin Scorsese in ""Shutter Island"" of underplaying his hand. The nominal task confronting him and his screenwriter Laeta Kalogridis is to take Dennis Lehanes novel of the same name and render it fit for the screen. Scorsese however has a deeper duty--to pillage all the B movies he has ever seen (including some that were forgotten by their own directors) and to enshrine the fixations and flourishes of style on which they relied. In a celebrated riff on ""Casablanca"" Umberto Eco wrote ""Two cliches make us laugh but a hundred cliches move us because we sense dimly that the cliches are talking among themselves celebrating a reunion."" ""Shutter Island"" is that reunion and that shrine. The result set in 1954 has tremendous style of its own. Consider the opening scene with a boat ghosting out of the fog (or rather out of ""The Fog""). On board are two U.S. marshals Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his new sidekick Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo). They are off to a pleasant spot in Boston Harbor Shutter Island which houses an asylum for the criminally insane. We wait for our first view of the place and wait and wait. Et voila a looming monolith of trouble clearly twinned with the Skull Island of ""King Kong."" The director of photography Robert Richardson has an extraordinary knack of allowing physical structures to brood over us in their solid mass and yet to hover as ungraspably as a dream. The boat approaches the dock. ""Only way on--or off"" the captain says adding ""Storms coming."" Of course it is. The score then lets out three strong blasts halfway between string section and foghorn and reaches a shuddering climax as our hero reaches the gates of the asylum. To me all this seemed irreproachably comic but one of the oddities of ""Shutter Island""--a film of many mysteries not all of them bred by the plot--is that even as Scorsese hurls himself into the crowd of archetypes there is little or no evidence that he is armed with a sense of humor. But where pray are we supposed to place our tongues at the appearance of Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) if not in our cheeks? The head man--in every sense--of the asylum has a shiny dome a bow tie a prissified English accent and a belief in ""the moral fusion between law and order and clinical care."" Pssst. Keep an eye on Dr. Cawley. The actor who gets the best measure of his surroundings is Max von Sydow playing a German colleague of Dr. Cawleys. Ingmar Bergman once spoke of ""the subtle detachment which often exists between Max and my madmen"" and that subtlety pays off here from our first firelit glimpse of him behind the wing of a velvet armchair. There is in his performance a touch of the amused relish that was shown by Boris Karloff when he too oversaw an asylum in ""Bedlam"" the Val Lewton chiller of 1946. You can feel von Sydow weighing the new film in his palm and deciding to enjoy himself--far more so than DiCaprio who as Scorseses muse of choice has no option but to frown and bear it. The marshals have come to investigate the disappearance of a patient named Rachel Solando (Emily Mortimer) a murderess who has in Dr. Cawleys words ""evaporated through the walls."" To unravel the plot that follows would put me in the same position as a kitten with a ball of wool but then Scorsese is gripped less by the lure of the whodunnit than by the maddening spectacle of the whodathunkit. Events are complicated by the flashbacks that plague Teddy visions of his late wife Dolores (Michelle Williams) who died in a fire at their apartment building and of the trauma that he underwent in the Second World War when he was among the soldiers who liberated Dachau. The first of these is a wellspring of terrible beauty--a scene of saturated almost painful colors as Dolores clings to him and crumbles to ash in his arms. The Dachau sequences are another matter. It is one thing to conjure a fantasy from a mans grief; quite another to make aesthetic capital as Scorsese and Richardson do out of the heaped and frozen corpses in a concentration camp. You do not have to cleave to Adornos thesis--that the writing of poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric--to be vexed by the artfulness of the compositions here or to ask yourself What cause do these images serve? Are they exhibits in a sober cross-examining of evil? No when you come down to it they are props in a piece of high-toned silliness. People in ""Shutter Island"" mutter grimly of Nazis and hydrogen bombs but viewers are not here to see the wounds of history explored. They are here for the heebie-jeebies. What leads Scorsese to such material? He is scarcely required to prove his expertise; the thrill of watching the marshals blunder through a graveyard during a hurricane or Teddy tiptoe through Ward C the maximum-security wing with light and water dripping from on high and misting spookily underfoot shows a director in such command of his skills that no pathetic fallacy escapes him. Yet for all the tension of Teddys plight and despite our suspicions that he may not be the sanest soul around (""Pull yourself together"" he says into a mirror in the opening shot) nothing really seems to be at stake here. When Travis Bickle talked into a looking glass in ""Taxi Driver"" you felt the pressure of his solitude and the threat of his trigger-happiness. The same was true of Jake La Motta at the close of ""Raging Bull"" grunting ""Go get em champ"" to no one but his own reflection. Those films were written by Paul Schrader and the blend of his moral brinksmanship and Scorseses unshackled visual daring--one mans agony and anothers ecstasy--has yet to be recaptured. Next to those movies ""Shutter Island"" flickers and fades like the lights in Ward C and when one of the inmates says to Teddy ""This is a game and its all for you"" he gives that game away--not spoiling the story just scraping it clean of serious intent. The final twist is a fizzle; not because we see it coming (though we do) but because Scorsese with a great weight of exposition dumped in his lap struggles to keep it snappy. He even has a character stand beside a whiteboard and point out written clues. Its like having ""I Walked with a Zombie"" interrupted by ""Sesame Street."" When it comes to ripe old frighteners--or to any other overheated genre--Scorsese is the most ardent of proselytizers so much so that I would prefer to hear him enthuse about Hammer Horror films say than to watch a Hammer Horror film. ""Shutter Island"" with its remote lighthouse and its spiral staircase is a fleshing out of these scholarly crushes. That is why we get the patient with the Frankenstein stitches across his facial scar and the iron-hearted prison warden (Ted Levine) who during his only conversation with Teddy informs him that ""God loves violence."" These are not quite jokes but nor are they saddled with dramatic meaning; they are light rhetorical gestures toward the dark. No one is denying the energy and the dread that stalked the best B movies of the past but when the best director of the present revives such monsters how can he hope to do better than a B-plus? The hero of ""A Prophet"" Malik El Djebena (Tahar Rahim) is nineteen at the outset a blank slate of a boy just starting a French prison sentence of six years. By the time he reemerges at the end his features are filled out and his spirit is filled in--scrawled and blackened with the wisdom of the criminal code. Jail has educated him as a liberal society would hope and lent purpose to his life; he has learned to read and write to trade in drugs to play one ethnic group against another and to kill a man with a razor blade concealed in his cheek. Jacques Audiards film which lasts two and a half hours maintains an unflagging urgency stalling only when the double-dealing grows too dense. Early on Malik is asked by Luciani (the wonderful Niels Arestrup) who runs the Corsican faction in the prison and has most of the guards in his pocket to murder a fellow-Arab or die. Malik takes the first option only for his victim to haunt him thereafter--and at one point to glow with fire in uncanny parallel with the Dolores of ""Shutter Island."" From here on Malik is protected and schooled by Luciani perhaps too efficiently; in a heartbreaking late scene the pupil spurns his mentor like a vicious Prince Hal disdaining Falstaff. Apart from the odd ghost ""A Prophet"" runs on brutish naturalism with Audiard forsaking the sly wit of his earlier films like ""A Self-Made Hero"" and getting straight into the faces of his characters. On a short furlough Malik goes through airport security and without thinking opens wide and sticks out his tongue as he would during a regular inspection. Its a moment of greatness like Chaplin walking away from an assembly line in ""Modern Times"" still tightening nuts with an invisible wrench and it suggests--more plausibly and provokingly than the cell-life of ""Shutter Island"" though with a fraction of the dazzle--that you never really get out of jail. You just take your cage and leave.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Feb. 19 2010 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 313PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Shutter Island Directed by Martin Scorsese Written by Laeta Kalogridis Starring Leonardo DiCaprio Mark Ruffalo Ben Kingsley Classification NA Martin Scorseses latest Shutter Island poses a dilemma that audiences rarely have to face. The films final 15 minutes are intriguing and truly gripping leaving us to exit the theatre beguiled by the storys resolution but struggling with a much larger and lingering question Was it worth slogging through the nearly two hours of damned muddle to get to those last affecting moments? Not often in movies is the destination so much better than the journey. The trip begins in fog literally as a ferry chugs through the murk towards an island in the Boston harbour an isolated place that houses an asylum for the criminally insane. The time is 1954 and on board are two U.S. marshals. Teddy (Leonardo DiCaprio) is the senior of the pair a hard-boiled veteran of both law enforcement and the Second World War. Hard-boiled but as the boat rolls vulnerable too - hes seasick and whats more is still grieving over the death of his wife in a flash fire. His partner Chuck (Mark Ruffalo) is newer to the job yet seems a calmer soul an anchor of steadiness. Theyre heading over to investigate the disappearance of a female patient a mother confined for murdering her three children who has inexplicably escaped and has yet to be found. Immediately upon their arrival the score strikes up a shamelessly melodramatic pounding and the pathetic fallacy follows with hurricane force. Yes ""a storm is coming."" Is it ever although the wind and rain are the least of the problems. Instead right quick its hailing genres its sleeting styles its pouring themes as Scorsese drawing upon his encyclopedic store of filmic references blows up a bloody cyclone of movie quotes that has us less impressed than confused less illuminated than blinded. Why the outpouring? Well partly its the fault of the source material The Dennis Lehane novel a departure from his usual street-crime grittiness is something of a Gothic mishmash. Partly its a function of the period setting The early fifties are a murky time indeed with its own twin fogs of war the residue of the global conflict that ended and the mire of the Cold War that replaced it. And partly its attributable to the labyrinthine plot and the asylum locale There psychiatry is itself conflicted about how to treat the mentally ill with the surgeons who lobotomize battling the pharmacists who tranquilize. So as Teddy and his apparently fragile self enter the frays were suddenly watching multiple flicks at once. The cop investigation is detective noir. The loony bin shenanigans heightened by the ominous presence of Ben Kingsley and Max von Sydow on the medical staff is psycho-horror. The emerging possibility that pernicious brain experiments are going on funded by the government is pure conspiracy thriller tinged with McCarthy-era paranoia. The flashbacks to Teddys military past - he helped to liberate Dachau - is documentary realism. But the recurring dream sequences where his late wife keeps popping up in flames are Daliesque surrealism. And when the action shifts beyond the hospital walls and rats by the hundreds start scurrying out of cliff-side caves its just B-movie schlock. In his great iconic works Scorsese always professed a disdain for directing plot - character dialogue mood those were his passion. Here faced with a veritable avalanche of plot cascading off in unlikely directions he retreats into quotation. Preminger Fuller Hitchcock and others beyond count all get their due lovingly so. Consequently in lieu of a single coherent style its like flipping the pages of a cinematic dictionary. The cliche used to be that old directors never die they become photographers. Not Scorsese - seems hes becoming a lexicographer. All this puts his recent go-to actor DiCaprio in a quandary forced to adapt his performance to the ever-changing flicks. Under the circumstances he does remarkable well - tough cop one moment broken vessel the next - and manages to neatly embody the Cuckoos Nest question at the centre of the piece Just whos crazy in this mad microcosm of a world and who isnt? Again the eventual reply in those climactic frames is by far the sanest part of the picture when it finally settles into focus allowing us to see clearly and feel if not anything profound at least something palpable. Yet that bigger question remains and as the lights come up so does the answer Sorry but the late reward hardly justifies all that punishment.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Martin Scorseses ""Shutter Island"" is a vastly intelligent movie. A film historian par excellence the director along with screenwriter Laeta Kalogridis crafts a heady thriller out of Dennis Lehanes best-selling mystery. The film starring Leonardo DiCaprio as a wounded dogged federal marshal mixes the psychological with the political the personal trauma with historic angst. Violence is paired with its most common victims women and children. But men suffer greatly as well. As the film opens a ferry breaches the mist as it heads toward a rocky island that houses Ashecliffe Hospital for the ""criminally insane."" The ships horn blasts give way to more menacing bass notes of music supervisor Robbie Robertsons score. The year is 1954. The world is dishing out its own versions of madness. The Cold War is turning icier. The House Un-American Activities Committee continues its poking and prodding. Aboard ship Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio) turns green even though the boat hardly seems to pitch or roll as it plows its way toward its destination a foreboding mass of stone part of the Boston Harbor Islands. His new partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) stands as steady as can be on the deck. DiCaprio portrays Teddy with a look of pinched determination and later an air of collapsed certainty. Theyve been summoned to investigate the disappearance of an inmate. Like many a female killer Rachel Solando turned her violence on her children. Now shes vanished. In a fortress as impressive as Al- catraz poof Both Emily Mortimer and Patricia Clarkson portray the missing killer which should give you an idea of the doubling identities the movie entertains. The twists are involving. But its a shame ""Shutter Island"" never approaches being moving -- a strange failing for a story propelled by personal and historical cataclyms. Those two strains collide in Teddy. A war hero he was one of the U.S. soldiers that liberated the Nazi concentration camp Dachau. He is also a widower prone to post-traumatic stress flashbacks and cruel dreams. Michelle Williams appears as dead wife Dolores. In one evocatively shot scene she turns into a crumbling pillar of ash in his arms. She reappears again and again. She nudges him in visions. The man responsible for her death may also be housed at Ashecliffe. Shutter Islands chief caretaker Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) describes the institution as ""A moral fusion between law and order and clinical care."" Teddys not having it. He continually calls the inhabitants ""prisoners."" Cawley corrects him. ""Patients."" He seems more prickly than the case requires. Its the tangle of Teddys wounded psyche with the mystery that propels the drama. Lightning slashes thunder thrashes. A storm builds into a hurricane. Theres no shortage of the symbolic. ""Shutter Island"" is Gothic. It partakes of other cinematic traditions too. For his cast and crew Scorsese screened a number of touchstone films including Robert Wises ""The Haunting"" Otto Premingers ""Laura"" and ""Titicut Follies"" Frederick Wisemans shattering 1967 documentary about the Bridgewater State Hospital for the criminally insane in Massachusetts. Novelist Lehane is a master of uneasy endings. Revisit of the rough moral conclusions of ""Mystic River"" and ""Gone Baby Gone."" ""Shutter Island"" is different only in that it tempts us to reenter the conspiratorial fray to once again engage our doubts about what we and Teddy have been through. What is real? What is delusion? What is montrous? What is decent? ""Shutter Island"" may not shatter the heart but these are gnawing achievements for a movie about madness and paranoia.

These moments seem designed to make us feel as confused and frustrated as Teddy Daniels the short-tempered federal marshal played by Leonardo DiCaprio in charge of investigating an inexplicable escape at a mental hospital for the criminally insane. Movie Information Shutter IslandRatingShowtimes | Official site | TrailerDirector Martin ScorseseActors Leonardo DiCaprio Mark Ruffalo Ben Kingsley Max von Sydow Michelle Williams Emily Mortimer Ted Levine and Patricia ClarksonRun time 138 minutesMPAA rating R (disturbing violent content language and some nudity)Synopsis Two U.S. Marshals (Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo) travel to a remote island to investigate the disappearance of a hospitalized murderer.More movies from GuideLive.comBut then Shutter takes a risky header off the deep end and darned if you dont get suckered into following along. Martin Scorsese is a fanatical film buff and his latest work nods and twitches its respects to films as varied as Shock Corridor Sam Fullers pulp piece about a reporter who goes nuts investigating a crime in a mental hospital and A Beautiful Mind which dares us to distinguish the real from the illusory.In the end Shutter Island stands as its own kind of freak-out paranoid willfully devious pitying of a man whose fatal flaw leads him down a cinematic rabbit hole.Based on the novel by Dennis Lehane (Mystic River) Shutter Island announces its foreboding intentions with a sparse and ominous score that follows Teddy and his partner Chuck (Mark Ruffalo) to a craggy rock in outer Boston Harbor in the mid-1950s. Soon theyre poking around a facility that combines the aesthetics of an elite East Coast boarding school and a terrifying maximum-security prison.Scorsese hints at Teddys inner demons with subliminal flashbacks of his liberating a Nazi camp. The splitting migraines dont help nor does the cunning gamesmanship of the hospital honchos led by old pros Ben Kingsley and Max von Sydow slinkier than ever in his autumnal years.Shutter Island deals better in mood and atmosphere than in narrative coherence. The editing lighting and subjective camera angles leave the viewer just disoriented enough to keep squirming; the most similar film in the Scorsese catalogue is his remake of Cape Fear with its carefully calculated horror movie shocks (and genre roots). This isnt prestige Marty which helps explain its February release date.But the further Shutter Island goes the more it delights in shaking the ground beneath the viewers feet and reminding you of cinemas unparalleled ability to mess with your head. It twists and violently so. It plays with ideas of perception conspiracy and reality. A few more comparisons may be helpful in shining light without spilling the beans. Think Kiss Me Deadly with its cryptic (and then not so cryptic) intimations of Cold War turned white hot. Or The Manchurian Candidate and its story of brainwashed sleeper assassins. Or more recently Angel Heart haunted by Mickey Rourkes futile climactic cry ""I know who I am"" Like that film Shutter Island is the story of a tortured detective searching for an existential something he doesnt want to find.In the end Shutter Island rattles your cage and leaves you fumbling for a firm place to stand. It entangles illusion and perception sanity and madness as only pure cinema can; you leave the theater a bit jittery and unsettled. This is among Scorseses many gifts Even when hes not crafting a masterpiece he reminds you that the movies possess visceral and uncanny powers. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

Paramount Pictures By John Anderson Updated Feb. 19 2010 1201 a.m. ET Like an unassisted triple play or a blue moon the release Friday of films by both Martin Scorsese and Roman Polanski seems to demand some kind of acknowledgment. If nothing else the coincidence dispels some suspicion that movie studios are in collusion Both Mr. Scorseses ""Shutter Island"" and Mr. Polanskis ""The Ghost Writer"" are likely to appeal to the same audiences of people who crave fiber in their movie diet who have followed their careers since American cinemas ballyhooed renaissance of the 70s or who simply consider them two of the more interesting filmmakers of their generation. Mr. Scorsese is 67 Mr. Polanski 76 a fact which should confound the numerologists. The rest of us will have enough of a time wrestling with the films. Shutter Island Watch a clip from ""Shutter Island"" about a woman who escapes from a mental institution; starring Leonardo DiCaprio Mark Ruffalo Ben Kingsley and Patricia Clarkson. Video courtesy of Paramount Pictures. In ""Shutter Island"" Mr. Scorseses 21st narrative feature and his most enigmatic the director has made multiple movies from Dennis Lehanes best-selling novel of the same title The one you see the first time and the one(s) you see the second. Such claims can be made about other films of course--Hitchcocks ""Vertigo"" for instance which the Mr. Scorsese refers to here more than once. But for all the immediacy and seemingly disposable pulp in its fiction ""Shutter Island"" requires multiple viewings to be fully realized as a work of art. Its process is more important than its story its structure more important than the almost perfunctory plot twists it perpetrates. Its a thriller a crime story and a tortured psychological parable about collective guilt. But in the end ""Shutter Island"" is the cinematic equivalent of a Joseph Cornell box a world of appropriated ingredients given new meaning through their combination and juxtaposition. It wont be a beloved movie. It will inspire doctoral dissertations. And while this news may not bring unbridled joy to the folks at Paramount Pictures let them be consoled by the thought that it possesses a kind of obsessive perfection. Which is not to say that there arent satisfactions to be had on a single trip to ""Shutter Island"" which boasts a spectacular cast that includes Ben Kingsley Max von Sydow Emily Mortimer and that goddess Patricia Clarkson. From the slap-hammer opening credits this is a movie in a mood. Imagine walking into the middle of someone elses family fight. Youre not quite sure why the atmosphere is so fraught with hysteria but you sense that its safer not to ask. The year is 1954 the day is gray the heaving water on Boston Harbor looks as welcoming as a grave. U.S. marshals Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Chuck Aule (the eminently watchable Mark Ruffalo) are aboard a patrol boat heading to Ashecliffe Hospital a facility for the criminally insane where a patient named Rachel Soldano has apparently executed a Houdini-like escape from her windowless cell. Having murdered her three small children the cops are told she has never accepted the deaths or the fact that shes imprisoned in the ghastly Ashecliffe. She thinks shes living in the Berkshires. Perhaps shes just gone for a hike. And taken reality with her. Teddy is officially on Shutter Island to find Rachel but hes arrived with another agenda Human experimentation has taken place there and he intends to crack the case wide open. But who is and isnt cracked becomes harder and harder to determine as Shutter Island wraps itself around him. More Speakeasy Shutter Island Review Revue Ewan McGregor on Playing a Part for Polanski Dennis Lahane the Author Who Aced Hollywood Speakeasy Scorsese on the Difficult Shutter Island Shoot The plots dry bones which in his novel Mr. Lehane seems to have exhumed from the more hardboiled and allegorical B-movies of the 40s and 50s are just that a skeletal frame over which Scorsese can drape a garment woven from the accumulated knowledge of his lifetime as a movie watcher. You can see why he wanted to make this film Its a story begging for visual layers. From the Hitchcockian back projections against which Teddy and Chuck are framed to the kind of shadowy elegance found in the work of 40s producer Val Lewton and director Jacques Tourneur (""Cat People"" ""I Walked With a Zombie"") Mr. Scorsese is accessing all the macabre thrillers he has in his head. To catalogue them here wouldnt just be pretentious it would be impossible. The director is working as he has three times previously (in ""Gangs of New York"" ""The Aviator"" and his Oscar-winner ""The Departed"") with Leonardo DiCaprio who has never seemed so substantial. Hes thickened a least for this role which calls for him to be both hardened and tenderized like a cheap steak under the meat mallet. Life has been a nightmare for Teddy and a recurring one. Almost immediately after his arrival on Shutter flashbacks begin both of his dead wife (a terrific Michelle Williams) and of the liberation of Dachau where he remembers slaughtering Nazis. The question most people will want answered is does it work as a thriller? And the answer is sort of. Everything is overwrought notably the engorged dialogue by screenwriter Laeta Kalogridis crafted out of Mr. Lehanes film-noirish patois and the music which may lack the specific gravity of a Bernard Herrmann score (like the one he did for ""Vertigo"") lingers in the mind like the films ever-present cigarette smoke and mood of anxiety. Take the use of Mahlers Quartet for Strings and Piano in A minor. It functions here on two levels. Only the first movement has survived so the presence of a fragmentary work by an Austrian Jew is an oblique comment on the storys fractured characters. In addition it embellishes Mr. Scorseses vision of Dachau--here filtered through Teddys tortured viewpoint--in which winter has turned a death camp into a frozen tableaux of permanently lovely children and the dead flow from freight cars as if from a fountain. Not since ""Raging Bull"" has Mr. Scorsese so brazenly married brutality to beauty. Not since ""Kundun"" has one of his films felt so aspirational. The Ghost Writer ENLARGE Ewan McGregor assists a former prime minister in The Ghost Writer. Summit Entertainment Adam Lang the former British prime minister portrayed by Pierce Brosnan in ""The Ghost Writer"" cant leave America. Having played lapdog to an unnamed American president hes been indicted the International Criminal Court for crimes that involve illegal renditions and torture. So if he wants to avoid arrest hell have to hole up in some rogue state that doesnt recognize the ICC--Iran perhaps or North Korea or more likely the U.S. Rare will be the viewer not looking for ironies in ""The Ghost Writer"" and finding them. Start with the plot with its inescapable echoes of Mr. Polanskis own situation. The point is theres really no agenda in Mr. Polanskis film except as regards secret governments the CIA the accommodations that the powerful often make to immorality and the telling of an exhilarating intelligent character-driven tale of political intrigue. Compared to ""Shutter Island"" Mr. Polanskis film (adapted from a novel of the same title by Robert Harris who co-wrote the screenplay) practically comes with a GPS system. Like the other film ""Ghost Writer"" begins with a boat docking--albeit without its key passenger a writer and personal confidante of the former prime minister whos been helping Lang write his memoirs. After the scribe washes up in the Marthas Vineyard surf a replacement ""ghost"" (Ewan McGregor) is hired handed a brutal deadline and the task of translating Langs stultifying memoir into commercially viable prose. Then all hell breaks loose as the World Court prepares to prosecute and our ghost discovers far more about his collaborator and his predecessor than is good for his health. Mr. Polanski is a magician his movie a synthesis of Mr. Harriss sturdy narrative a Mamet-like appreciation for the shadows that lurk between words and a drollery that most directors wouldnt even think about attaching to a thriller. But ""Ghost"" is far more than a suspense film and its cast is a cache of jewels--the most glittering of which is Olivia Williams who in a virtuoso performance as Langs wife Ruth creates a character who defies all casual adjectives. Manipulative? Macbethian? Clintonian? No Ruth Lang is sui generis a sexy/fearsome teeth-baring seductress who when not simply radiating intelligence is disposed to stalking the dunes in a cowl that makes her seem like the French Lieutenants Woman crossed with Hillary Clinton. Ruth suppressed her own political career for the sake of her husbands and because shes just barely of an age when such sacrifices were expected shes all the more bitter for it. Adding to her angst is her husbands in-house mistress the provocatively named Amelia Bly. Amelia is played by a Kim Cattrall who is virtually unrecognizable partly because shes so good. Who knew there was such subtlety behind Samantha Jones? And yes the boys are good too. Spectacular actually. Mr. McGregor is a remarkably versatile player and Mr. Brosnan while not mimicking Tony Blair in any way does nail the type of man for whom authority has become a casual vice. (During a press conference Lang lapses into Churchill and its hilarious). Add Tom Wilkinson as a dubious academic and Robert Pugh as one of Langs political rivals and ""The Ghost Writer"" is so rich you may feel you paid too little for your ticket when the whole thing meets its very Polanski-ish climax.

DVD Focus ENLARGE Personal Journey With Martin Scorsese Through American Cinema (1995) ""Shutter Island"" takes a film trip of its own but this is the officially sanctioned guided tour as hosted by its director timed to help celebrate the 100th anniversary of the movies. Surveying a centurys worth of cinema the director examines the creative process narrative and film technology and offers his appreciations of those who most influenced him. As someone who can access a film-school-thesis-worth of movie information in the course of a cocktail-party conversation Mr. Scorsese is the perfect host on his favorite subject. ENLARGE Roman Polanski Wanted and Desired (2008) The likely cause of Mr. Polanskis current trouble--he remains under house arrest in Switzerland as Los Angeles County tries to extradite him--Marina Zenovichs documentary chronicles the heartbreaks and tragedies of Polanskis life including the murder of his pregnant wife actress Sharon Tate by the Manson family. But it also suggests quite strenuously and effectively that the original judge and prosecutors in the Polish-born directors sex case reneged on the plea deal theyd had with the accused prompting him to flee the country. ENLARGE Titicut Follies (1967) The venerable Frederick Wiseman master of fly-on-the-wall nonfiction cinema shot this unforgettable documentary at the State Prison for the Criminally Insane in Bridgewater--which like the fictional Shutter Island was in Massachusetts. A judge there banned the film in 1968 citing concern for patient privacy (and making it the first movie banned in the United States for reasons other than obscenity morality or national security). The decision was reversed in the early 90s. The title by the way comes from a talent show put on the inmates whose treatment by the commonwealth was something less than luxurious. --John Anderson Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Directed by Martin Scorsese. 140 minutes. At major theatres. Article Continued Below14A""If youre going to fail fail big"" the old saying goes and thats just about the only positive thing that can be said about Shutter Island Martin Scorseses elephantine exercise in B-movie badness.Just a couple of smirks shy of a Mel Brooks parody Shutter Island takes Scorseses crazy love of cinema to ludicrous extremes forsaking all logic for a chance to revel in the style of hard-boiled psychodramas and film noir from the 40s and 50s. Brooks was out for laughs with his Hitchcock riff High Anxiety; Scorsese is painfully serious with his own Hitchcock man-crush. Scorsese and screenwriter Laeta Kalogridis treat the source novel by Dennis Lehane (who also wrote Mystic River) as deep philosophy about dark secrets rather than the page-turning pulp fiction it is. We need wonder no longer why Shutter Island suddenly vanished off the awards season radar last fall much like the missing nuthouse inhabitant who brings Leonardo DiCaprios seasick gumshoe Teddy Daniels on a Quixotic quest to the titular isle.Its a dark and stormy afternoon as Boston-based U.S. Marshal Daniels and his new Seattle sidekick Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) arrive at the Ashecliffe Hospital for the Criminally Insane the last resort for lost causes. The hospital is run by the bow-tied and bespoke-dressed Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) who is so tightly wound he chomps his pipe as if hes cracking skulls. He professes to be a man of compassion offering care for the most maligned of societys cast-offs - most of whom are psychotic murderers.Cawleys hawk-eyed intensity wasnt enough to prevent the disappearance of multiple child murderer Rachel Solando who seemingly vanished into thin air a few nights previously.As Daniels and Aule poke around the premises and interrogate unhelpful hospital staff and inmates they discover that things are not what they seem - although they should seem pretty weird what with everybody giving ominous stares and making spooky statements. Cue big scary music which Scorseses soundtrack supervisor Robbie Robertson does to ludicrously bombastic affect further weakening the gravity of an already risible scenario. A hurricane that seems to come and go at the whim of plot convenience doesnt do much to bolster confidence either and cinematographer Robert Richardson and production designer Dante Ferretti are almost too good at evoking the requisite gloom.Charitable viewers (and Scorsese apologists) will argue that the director isnt trying to make strict sense of the situation as witness his frequent use of hallucinatory sequences - most of them involving Michelle Williams as Daniels desperately unhinged wife.This line of reasoning might succeed only if the casting were better. DiCaprio is out of his league in this role despite having proved in Revolutionary Road and Scorseses earlier The Departed that his baby face need not be an impediment to serious drama. Hes just not credible in the scuffed shoes of an alcoholic copper who also bears the psychic scars in World War II of having been one of the first soldiers to liberate the Dachau concentration camp and to witness the horrors therein. Robert Mitchum would have stubbed out his ciggie on the forehead of a guy like DiCaprio.Ruffalo is much more convincing as the tensely deferential Aule who repeatedly calls his superior ""boss"" yet who obviously doesnt believe the man deserves the title. Its actually one of Ruffalos better roles in recent years; too bad its stuck on Shutter Island. Kingsley meanwhile does his standard ace impression of an outraged egghead yet doesnt get enough screen time to really make anything more of it.Scorseses high standing in filmdom allows him to attract all sorts of talent to projects regardless of script and he lards the film with stunt-casted cameos by well-known people who look like they just stumbled out of a Guy Maddin movie. It seems that every time Daniels turns around hes running into another familiar face hiding in a cave prison or basement belonging to someone who couldnt resist acting (make that overacting) in a Martin Scorsese picture.All these scenery chompers make for a very crowded frame and bloat the running time to an unconscionable two hours 20 minutes - which is about an hour past the point where any halfway alert viewer will have figured out whats really going on. We may be forced to endure Shutter Island but we need not feel committed to it.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

(AP Photo/Paramount Pictures Andrew Cooper) <<1>> It can take considerable time and patience for a partnership to reach its full potential. The cinematic union between director Martin Scorsese and actor Leonardo DiCaprio is one case in point. The duos three film pairings before ""Shutter Island"" have swung from the disappointing to the great with 2002s ""Gangs of New York"" a violent and unruly mess 2004s ""The Aviator"" a sweeping but in no way innovative big-screen bio and 2006s ""The Departed"" a taut and engrossing crime epic.Yet no matter how good the two have been together theyve been haunted even hounded by the specter of Scorseses previous four-star relationship with the great Robert De Niro. That is until ""Shutter Island."" With this impeccably crafted -- and creepy -- homage to film noir and Hitchcock Scorsese hands DiCaprio his meatiest and toughest role to date. Claims that the ""Titanic"" star is a lightweight unfit to shoehorn his way into De Niros polished acting shoes should be silenced by his measured textured performance in this film.DiCaprios Teddy Daniels does fall a bit short of the iconic stature rightfully awarded De Niros Travis Bickle (""Taxi Driver"") and Jake LaMotta (""Raging Bull"") characters synonymous with Americas best films. But audiences who meet Teddy will never forget him nor will they ever be able to shake off this lurid psychological thriller based on ""Mystic River"" author Dennis Lehanes boffo novel which went down as fast as a shot of Cuervo Gold. Advertisement Showing an explosive temper and a wounded psyche DiCaprio eerily channels the great Richard Widmark a film noir giant as Teddy a shaky World War II veteran still at war with his memories.Teddy and his partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) are the unfortunate officials shipped off in the 50s to Shutter Island from which a female insane-asylum patient who murdered her three children has escaped.

From the start Scorsese prepares us for the Grand Guignol approach hes taking as the boat carrying Teddy and Chuck approaches the fog-enshrouded island a spot festering with dread.

(Music supervisor Robbie Robertson mashed up the works over various composers and songs to fashion one very effective score.)In those first five minutes its clear the director can hardly contain his giddiness over finally finding a ""genre"" film on which to shower his noir love. Scorsese buffs might assume theyve journeyed down this road before with the directors uneven remake of ""Cape Fear."" But ""Island"" has sharper edges and a deeper emotional net than that violent 1991 redo. Its a superior film not just as a suspense piece but also for evoking a time an atmosphere and a mood.Part of its success belongs to production scouts for finding a now-shuttered Massachusetts hospital along with the grounds of a golf club to double for Asheville. The setting is the stuff of ""Silence of the Lambs"" foreboding. Every detail points to a master filmmaker working on overdrive although Scorseses flamboyant and violent style will likely be off-putting to some.

With an Oscar on his mantelpiece Martin Scorsese takes a breather from prestige pictures with ""Shutter Island"" an exquisitely crafted potboiler offering up 21/4 hours of thrills chills and Leonardo DiCaprio freaking out in a nuthouse during a hurricane. Working from a pulpy Gothic best seller by Dennis Lehane (""Mystic River"") Scorsese deploys a top-drawer cast in a convoluted story mixing Cold War paranoia the Holocaust Catholic guilt the mid-century debate over treatment of mental patients lengthy flashbacks vividly colored hallucinations -- and a big-twist ending thats less than entirely convincing. It certainly held my interest even through some very talky sequences as Scorsese draws on his encyclopedic knowledge of American cinema to provide a game of ""spot the movie reference"" (from Val Lewton thrillers of the 40s to Scorseses old stomping ground at American International Pictures) throughout the entertaining proceedings. PHOTOS INFLUENCES BEHIND SHUTTER ISLAND""S MOST MEMORABLE SCENES The story begins in 1954 with a ferry emerging through the fog as federal marshal Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio) already nauseated arrives on the titular island in Boston Harbor home of the Ashecliffe Asylum a maximum-security federal facility for the criminally insane. Teddy is there with a new partner (Mark Ruffalo) to investigate the mysterious disappearance -- from a locked cell -- of a woman (Emily Mortimer) who murdered her own children. Even as a force 5 hurricane howls down on Shutter Island (conveniently cutting off contact with the mainland) the chief physician (Ben Kingsley) is oddly evasive as he brags about his advocacy of humane alternatives to lobotomies for violent patients. Hes positively charming compared to his senior colleague an ex-Nazi psychiatrist (Max von Sydow) who triggers flashbacks of Teddys arrival as one of the GI liberators of the Dachau concentration camp during World War II. Thats hardly the only bad memory troubling Teddy who suffers from migraines and worse. He has recurring hallucinations involving among others his late wife (Michelle Williams) whose death he blames on himself. Teddy may have a secret agenda on Shutter Island. And without giving too much away so might the asylums management the US Marshals Service and the House Un-American Activities Committee not to mention Teddys partner and possibly the catering staff. Or is it all a series of paranoid delusions? Scorsese has great fun with a story that in the final analysis does not really demand to be taken any more seriously as history than ""Inglourious Basterds."" He creates a seriously creepy mood in the films opening moments and tightens the screws amid elaborate sets (some scenes were shot in an actual abandoned state asylum) and gorgeous cinematography -- though cinematographer Robert Richardsons rather pretty vision of Dachau made me queasy. DiCaprio is not quite as assured here as he was in ""Revolutionary Road"" or ""The Departed"" but hes much more than adequate as the tortured hero. The supporting cast is superb including Ted Levine and John Carroll Lynch as the islands high-strung wardens and Jackie Earle Haley and Patricia Clarkson as two of its more enigmatic denizens. Clarksons one-scene tour-de-force in a cave is so spectacular in fact that it threatens to undermine the climax. Some audience members may argue afterward that was the intention but I dont think so. ""Shutter Island"" strikes me as one of Scorseses more minor works a rather elaborate trifle one of our greatest directors has devised for his -- and our -- amusement. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Olympics oust Idol in TV ratings war Read Next Olympics oust Idol in TV ratings war Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 46195 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 20783 16 feared dead in Texas hot air balloon crash 17005 College student kills 3 in house party shooting cops Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

"Movie Review Martin Scorseses raving bull in Shutter Island washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On >> This StoryRead +|Watch +|Talk +| Comments Shutter Island Movie Review Martin Scorseses raving bull in Shutter Island Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday February 19 2010 If ""Shutter Island"" a gothic thriller starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo were put to a free association test the word most likely to come to mind would certainly be ""weird."" The movie begins in 1954 when two U.S. marshals Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio) and Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) arrive at the eponymous island just off Massachusetts where looms the impenetrable Ashecliffe Hospital for the criminally insane. The marshals have been detailed to find a prisoner -- er patient -- who has suddenly vanished from her locked cell like a wisp of the smoke from one of their ever-present cigarettes. This StoryShutter Island A Hitchcock-eyed murder mysteryWatch the Shutter Island trailerDiscuss The Scorsese/DiCaprio partnership As a hurricane bears down on the island the Teddy and Chuck interview Ashecliffes inhabitants and staff all the while matching wits with the hospitals chief physician the brilliant Dr. Cawley played with poker-faced elan by Ben Kingsley who insists that he is revolutionizing mental health by treating his patients with the compassion and dignity they deserve. And oh dont look too closely at that lighthouse over there its just a sewage treatment facility now nothing to see run along. ""Shutter Island"" has been adapted from Dennis Lehanes novel by Martin Scorsese who reaches back to nearly all his cinematic heroes -- Alfred Hitchcock Samuel Fuller Otto Preminger with a dash of John Frankenheimers ""The Manchurian Candidate"" thrown across his shoulder -- to create a pastiche of moody atmosphere stylized flashbacks and dream sequences and a devotion to flagrant violence that finally turns rancid and repulsive. Teddy a World War II veteran haunted by what he saw liberating Dachau as well as the death of his wife (Michelle Williams) recalls the world-weary antiheroes played by Dana Andrews in so many noir classics (and there are moments when DiCaprio resembles a young Orson Welles playing him). But as ""Shutter Island"" proceeds -- mostly as a series of speeches and set pieces -- what is meant to be mysterious and unsettling becomes just plain incomprehensible. And Scorseses fascination with images of dead children -- drowned bloodied ashen-faced -- isnt sinister or scary or even creepy. Its just weird.  1/2 R. At area theaters.

"Shutter Island | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; shutter-island ) Shutter Island (United States 2010) February 18 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli Spoiler Alert Although every effort has been made to limit the revelations in this review its difficult to provide a coherent discussion of Shutter Island without giving away something so readers are hereby placed on alert. If youre familiar with the book however theres no reason to stop herea| Whats wrong with Shutter Island? This has been the question ever since Paramount Pictures elected to move the Martin Scorsese-directed thriller from its comfortable pre-Oscar position to the wastelands of February. It turns out that theres nothing wrong with Shutter Island - except perhaps that its not Oscar worthy material. An atmospheric mind-fuck of a thriller this movie delights in playing games with the audiences perceptions and has been crafted with such competence that it rises above the somewhat generic storyline that forms the basis of Dennis Lehanes novel. The strength of the film like the book is that it never allows the viewer to feel comfortable with what he is watching. Thats because Shutter Island is presented from the perspective of an unreliable narrator and as such the lines between fantasy and reality sometimes blur so strongly that its easy to become unanchored in trying to distinguish between whats real and what isnt. A case can be made that the movie is so enamored with this aspect of its approach that it fails to connect on an emotional level. Shutter Island addresses some powerful disturbing concepts but despite effective performances by the leads the movies psychological impact is minimal. It doesnt pack the powerhouse punch one has come to expect from Scorsese. Still the directors consummate skill has lifted what might otherwise be a middling endeavor into something compellingly watchable. Its another Cape Fear. The time is 1954 with the Cold War and its associated paranoia on the rise and the black magic of Nazi Germany still not entirely dispelled. The place is Shutter Island a forbidding outcropping off the New England coast. Shutter Island houses Ashecliffe Hospital an asylum for the criminally insane. Even more escape-proof than Alcatraz Shutter Island virtually guarantees that the only ways out are through an officially sanctioned release or as a victim of the sea and the rocks it pummels. Federal marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his new partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) arrive on blustery early autumn day to investigate the disappearance of a prisoner Rachel Solando (Emily Mortimer) who has vanished without a trace. Her doctors Cawley (Ben Kingsley) and Naehring (Max von Sydow) are less than open about whats going on behind-the-scenes on the island and their unhelpfulness arouses Teddys suspicions that all is not what it appears to be. Clues lead him to believe hes not merely investigating the disappearance of one woman but that he has stumbled upon experimentation exported from Germany and being used to develop perfect Cold Warriors. From a strictly narrative standpoint Shutter Island reflects its source material. The movie is unlike either of the recent Lehane adaptations Mystic River and Gone Baby Gone in that its more gothic and atmospheric and divorced from the realities of modern tragedy. Shutter Islands position as a period piece allows Scorseses stylized perspective to work effectively. He borrows liberally from film noir and conventional horror synthesizing a result that at times recalls the way in which Stanley Kubrick approached The Shining. Its unlikely any other director would have made Shutter Island in quite the same way. The place is a character. The stormy weather is a character. Even the loud thunderous music is a character. We recognize from the beginning that something is ""off."" Without going into details which might spell out too many of the narratives detours I can say that Scorsese conveys the influence of an unreliable narrator without explicitly revealing where the perspective diverges from an objective view of events. As a result we can never fully trust what were seeing. In most movies its an easy enough task to differentiate between dream sequences flashbacks and concrete reality. These elements are present in Shutter Island but the lines between them blur. Only in retrospect is it possible to delineate them. The problem with the film (to the extent that it is a problem) is that the central tragedies of Teddys character are emotionally muted. They begin (in flashback) with his reaction to the concentration camp at Dachau where he arrives as a member of the liberating force and continue to a more recent event the death of his beloved wife Dolores (Michelle Williams) in a fire. He is a tortured haunted man and those things only begin to reveal the demons that claw at his soul. Yet perhaps because the structure necessitates this Scorsese keeps the viewer at arms-length. We observe the character from a distance and never empathize with him. We acknowledge his pain but dont experience it alongside him. For all that the craft of Shutter Island eclipses that of Mystic River and Gone Baby Gone its emotional impact is inferior. DiCaprio who has become Scorseses go-to actor in the post-DeNiro era turns in another strong mature performance. In the immediate wake of Titanic DiCaprio allowed himself to cash in a little on his success but over the years he has gravitated more toward prestige projects working for respected directors (Scorsese Christopher Nolan Same Mendes Edward Zwick). Had Shutter Island maintained its original late-2009 release date DiCaprio would have been in the running for a Lead Actor Oscar nomination. He is ably supported by screen legends Ben Kingsley and Max von Sydow who use their reputations to good effect. Mark Ruffalo is a little bland but his character doesnt have much to do. The rest of the cast is comprised of accomplished character actors Emily Mortimer Patricia Clarkson Jackie Earle Haley Ted Levine John Carroll Lynch Elias Koteas. (Contrary to a surprisingly long-legged rumor thats making the Internet rounds DeNiro does not make an appearance.) Shutter Island is satisfying in ways that February movies often are not. Like all solid thrillers it engages while challenging the intellect. Its puzzle while not as twisty as some is nevertheless enticing to piece together. Yet its easy to understand Paramounts reluctance to release the movie in the thick of the Oscar season because its not really an awards-caliber movie. Shutter Island is enjoyable in part because of the way Scorsese approaches the material but it is ultimately nothing more than a well-made genre effort. Relieved of the weight of Oscar expectations perhaps Shutter Island will open up to audiences who view Scorsese as being too ""artistic."" After all this production is many things but pretentious is not among them.

Media San Francisco Chronicle If Martin Scorsese werent aware of himself as a great filmmaker he could never have made a movie as bad as ""Shutter Island."" The potential was here for some trashy fun for a punchy 100-minute edge-of-your-seat thriller. Instead Scorsese tries to transform Dennis Lehanes novel into an epic psychological investigation. He stuffs the film with heavy-handed art direction and piles on a ludicrously ominous soundtrack. The soundtrack is a constant reminder of the movies importance and only highlights its unimportance. Scorsese needs to stop trying to make great movies. He should just try to make good movies to make them as good as he can - which is as good as anyone can - and just have faith that the gods of inspiration will come and bless the effort. Aiming for goodness Scorsese will hit greatness. Aiming for laurels for a film with the scale and dimension befitting a filmmaker of his stature he just lands in vulgarity and bombast in a zone very near self-parody. ""Shutter Island"" plays for about three minutes before something goes wrong. When we first meet Leonardo DiCaprio playing a U.S. marshal hes seasick on a boat heading to Shutter Island off the coast of Massachusetts. He staggers out onto the deck where he meets his new partner (Mark Ruffalo). The year is 1954 and everything about this simple scene between DiCaprio and Ruffalo is perfection - the clothes the haircuts and the tough clipped and yet fraternal interaction between two men. They seem like guys whove been to war who have that in their past and see that in each other. The feeling is very 1950s. Then - thrum thrum Thrum thrum The cellos of Robbie Robertsons score come blasting on the soundtrack as the ferry arrives at Shutter Island. The men are there to investigate the escape of a murderer from a mental health facility and the soundtrack is there to tell you oh no Oh no The fraught cellos followed by the freaking-out violins call to mind Bernard Herrmanns scores for Alfred Hitchcock and there are other references to Hitchcock throughout eerily artificial-looking backgrounds or the placement of the protagonist in the lower right of the frame to suggest his vulnerability to assault. But overwrought Hitchcock references dont for a second make ""Shutter Island"" seem like a Hitchcock film. It seems more like an M. Night Shyamalan film (""Signs"" ""The Village""). And this feeling is reinforced when the two marshals begin to catch on that leaving the facility just might turn out to be harder than entering it. Enclosure and entrapment are recurring motifs for Shyamalan and its a familiar feeling for his audiences too stuck watching his worst movies. But this is a new sensation for Scorsese fans. Some may criticize DiCaprios performance as over the top but when all is said and done it has internal logic and consistency. The film places DiCaprio in a series of extreme situations - he has flashbacks and nightmares about liberating Dachau during World War II and of his wife (Michelle Williams) who died prematurely. No expense is spared on these flashbacks but expense should have been spared. They are exercises in visual pyrotechnics without impact and they go on and on and on ... DiCaprios main problem in ""Shutter Island"" is that hes saddled with a misbegotten screenplay by Laeta Kalogridis whose previous credits are ""Pathfinder"" and ""Alexander"" two bombs. Somewhere along the way Scorsese should have noticed that this screenplay requires that DiCaprio completely switch motivations on at least three occasions. He should also have noticed that the story as adapted by Kalogridis has DiCaprio realize something - and then 30 minutes later has him realize the exact same thing. Thus we have a half hour of screen time in which the story essentially stands still. The best work Scorsese does here is with his actors. Ruffalo brings a nice calm assurance to his role at all times in the midcentury American spirit. As the doctors in charge of the mental hospital Max von Sydow (hearty and implacable) and Ben Kingsley (genial but distant) suggest sinister undertones without descending into camp. There is also a memorable cameo from a lithe and feral Patricia Clarkson as an escapee from the facility. The quality of the scene work in ""Shutter Island"" shows a director of psychological insight who gets exceptional work from his actors. If I were Martin Scorseses best friend Id say concentrate on that and eliminate the clutter. The great-director thing is a burden. Drop it. Just you a camera and some actors. And a good script of course. Let the rest take care of itself. Or to put it another way When the legend gets in the way of the artist dump the legend. -- Advisory This film contains some nudity violence and strong language. Shutter Island Drama.

Leonardo DiCaprio playing U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels has lost the battle with seasickness as the ferry hes riding on the Boston Harbor approaches the forbiddingly craggy island that houses Ashecliffe Asylum. His destination is the stately but chilling institution for the criminally insane. Its 1954 and he is accompanied by partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) to investigate the mysterious disappearance of one of its inmates who is a psychopath and a killer. From the moment they approach the rocky isle the score -- supervised by The Bands Robbie Robertson-- pumps up the sense of foreboding with a creepy repetition of pounding musical chords. TRAILER Get a sense of Shutter Island Its technically masterful as only a film by visionary director Martin Scorsese can be and an almost unbearable sense of tension simmers and occasionally erupts in the first two-thirds of the film. The production design by Dante Ferretti is impeccable. Questions loom and rattle Are the lunatics running the asylum? Is the entire terrifying place embroiled in a horrific conspiracy? Who can be trusted? And what does it take to catapult a rational person into madness? While Ruffalo is convincingly congenial DiCaprios blend of brooding and unease is riveting. This is the actors fourth collaboration with Scorsese. His character is a sharp-eyed detective who is also damaged goods. As he struggles to subdue recurring memories of his war service and the tragic death of his wife you realize that an assignment at a clandestine mental institution is not the best idea for a troubled guy like him. The rest of the ensemble is equally terrific. The officious but outwardly sympathetic Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) keeps us off kilter. He seems intent on preserving the status quo but is he guilty of something more? He presents the marshals with their case the mind-boggling escape of a delusional killer (Emily Mortimer). Cawleys smug colleague Dr. Naehring (Max von Sydow) further obfuscates the situation. Hostility looms everywhere emanating from both patients and staff. Along the way there are flashbacks featuring Daniels dead wife (Michelle Williams) offering guidance from beyond the grave. Her scenes are filmed in particularly vivid bloody color establishing a sharp juxtaposition to the gray and stormy environment of the asylum. Patricia Clarkson has a superb cameo as a portentous character. But there are weak spots. When focused on the insane asylum the gloomy story -- a Hitchcockian take on Dennis Lehanes novel -- is unnerving and unrelenting. But it loses steam when it meanders into flashbacks and a pat conclusion doesnt help. The denouement gets bogged down in large chunks of narrative explanation presented in a strange blend of the overwrought and the obvious undercutting the powerfully frightening scenes that went before. Also a too-long and too-grisly climactic scene plunges what had been an enjoyable psychological thriller/horror hybrid into something far more dark and disturbing. As invested as we are in the agonized character superbly etched by DiCaprio the twist feels both expected and convoluted. Still despite its flaws Shutter Island is worth seeing for the palpably nightmarish and gothic world conceived by Scorsese.

"Review Shutter Island - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Leonardo DicaprioMOVIE REVIEW Review Shutter IslandLife lurks in the scary shadows of Martin Scorseses film which features a fine performance by Leonardo DiCaprio.February 19 2010|By Betsy Sharkey | Film Critic gt;gt;gt; Leonardo DiCaprio is a federal marshal in Martin Scorseses thriller... (Andrew Cooper / Associated...)In ""Shutter Island"" director Martin Scorsese has created a divinely dark and devious brain tease of a movie in the best noir tradition with its smarter than youd think cops their tougher than youd imagine cases to crack and enough nods to the classic genre for an all-night parlor game. Its 1954 the heart of the Cold War with a conspiracy theory around every corner when Leonardo DiCaprios U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels and his new partner played by Mark Ruffalo are dispatched to an asylum for the criminally insane to investigate a dicey disappearance. One of the facilitys most notorious patients a young mother who drowned her three children has somehow vanished from a room monitored 24 hours a day its door bolted from the outside. But there are deeper mysteries here and Scorsese has a lot more on his mind than one crazy inmate on the loose. The A-bomb threat is ever present memories of Nazi death camps linger and rumors of questionable scientific experiments by the asylums doctors are circulating. Though the more central question gathering force like the coming hurricane is the very nature of sanity and insanity. Bit by bit the filmmakers begin to shift all that trouble onto Teddys shoulders already weighed down weve been told by the death of his wife and the knowledge that her killer is an inmate at the asylum. But Teddys problems are never too much for Scorsese and DiCaprio who in their fourth collaboration have developed an ease evident in every scene. Here the actor slips so deeply inside Teddys skin that it allows his anxiety to creep under ours while the director makes the most of that naked vulnerability moving the camera in so close we can see the look in his eye and that is unsettling indeed. All the action takes place on a remote island off the Eastern Seaboard where Ashecliffe Hospital sits with the sinister look of things serving to ratchet up the sense of jeopardy. Dante Ferretti in his seventh film with Scorsese sets the stage with his production design the asylum itself a looming Gothic architectural throwback that never looks less than intimidating. There is a carefully orchestrated soundtrack from another of the directors pals singer-songwriter Robbie Robertson literally coming in with a crescendo every time you feel the urge to whisper ""Cue ominous music."" Between the psychopaths the psychiatrists and the skeletons in Teddys closet the line between reality and delusion sanity and insanity soon begins to blur. It is here that the film really begins playing around with the psyche both Teddys and ours though the agenda is laid out from director of photography Robert Richardsons first images of Teddy reeling from seasickness in the claustrophobic latrine of the prison ferry on the ride over -- tortured eyes looking back at us from the mirror as he splashes water onto his face. Water is an image Scorsese returns to again and again -- the ocean that isolates the island the relentless hurricane that rages down the drowned children of the missing inmate. Peril rather than life-sustaining seems to be the relevant allegory here so you soon start worrying when anyone turns up wet. Using noirs narrative style often to brilliant effect it is pure pleasure to watch as Teddy parries with his partner the hospital staff led by Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) the inmates or the security detail with John Carroll Lynch particularly good as the brick wall of Deputy Warden McPherson. Its probably never better than in a confrontation with the shadow king of Ashecliffe Hospital Max von Sydows Dr. Naehring Teddy throwing down hypotheses suggesting his guilt like a gauntlet Dr. Naehring deflecting each one with bemused irony. In its own way Laeta Kalogridis screenplay which is based on the Dennis Lehane bestselling novel turns into Teddys most formidable adversary -- never letting him rest as obstacles are thrown in his path and paranoia rises with every step he takes. Were pulled deep into a maze so complex it threatens to cloud the story beginning with Teddys tortured memories of his wife Delores (Michelle Williams) and the migraines that plague him to say nothing of his World War II soldiering days including the liberation of Dachau and the horrors that implies. When the missing patient (Emily Mortimer as the younger Rachel Patricia Clarkson the elder) mysteriously turns up Teddys gut tells him a lot of questions remain. As if by design the hurricane finally blows in cutting off access to the mainland and creating a dark and stormy night filled with scary sounds ideal conditions for sleuthing around all those off-limits areas that any decent insane asylum has. While its clear Scorsese is having great fun tightening the screws at every turn some of the psychological tension that should have the crackle and shock of electricity in a thriller like this is lost in the crowd. There is always a sense that Teddys running out of time and for a while we dont know exactly why. Once we do Scorsese sets about tidying things up a bit too fast like a college professor who knows hes got to let the class out so lets just get through this shall we. Whether its a rushed dA(c)nouement or a tendency to overindulge in delusions the flaws are never enough to do permanent damage to the film. Ultimately Scorsese has given us a new noir classic though watching Di- Caprios Teddy twist in the wind while his mind unravels would be satisfying enough. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESBetsy Sharkeys pick Shutter IslandMarch 18 2010Shutter draws a diverse crowdFebruary 22 2010For Shutter Island the wait may be worthwhileFebruary 18 2010Scorsese DiCaprio and Lehane navigate Shutter Islands...February 7 2010Shutter Island previewJanuary 17 2010Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-shutter-island19-2010feb19,0,3320659.story",200,shutterisland16,shutterisland,latimes

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Shutter Island"" is a great big bucket of creepy so steeped in strangeness that if it was any weirder it would be listed by the government as a Class 1 controlled substance. That is not to say it is a good movie. It falls far short of that. But its overripe atmospherics put it in that rare class of failures that can only be made by talented people falling on their face while reaching for the moon. Based on a mind-bending book by Boston noir specialist Dennis Lehane the film takes us into the deepest abyss of Cold War paranoia and long-buried psychological secrets. The year is 1954 as U.S. marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his new partner Chuck Aule arrive at fogbound Shutter Island off the Massachusetts coast. Its home to Ashecliffe Hospital a federal facility for the criminally insane where multiple murderess Rachel Soldano has vanished from her locked room. As they investigate her disappearance the mainland cops find the staff and physicians obstructive. Teddy who is prone to migraines begins to suspect that Dr. Cawley the enigmatic asylum director is spiking his aspirin with psychotropic drugs. The story crosses the boundary from dark detective fiction to gothic horror as the marshals find hints of grotesque psychological experiments and a hurricane kills the power to the security system. The violent patients riot and Teddy is tortured by apparitions of his dead wife as he begins doubting his partner his memory even his own grasp on reality. Director Martin Scorsese is aiming to create a journey into madness but the result is a pastiche of artfully composed shock effects set to dissonant avant-garde music. The film is constructed around a twisteroo that any fan of ""The Twilight Zone"" ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" or even ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" will see a mile off. Scorsese is a psychologically astute filmmaker. In ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Cape Fear"" he opened a trap door in the civilized forebrain and threw a bucket of bloody meat to the hungry crocodiles writhing in the sewer below. But in sticking close to Lehanes bestseller he creates technically sophisticated melodrama instead of conjuring nightmares. Between the taut first reel and strong finale the film drifts and dithers. For the first time ever in a Scorsese movie I found myself glancing at my wristwatch impatiently. DiCaprio a sublime actor offers a performance that is a series of variations on the theme of nervous tension. From the opening scene when Teddy is nauseated on the voyage to Shutter Island he seems more or less queasy. He doesnt descend from a self-assured square-jawed lawman to a basket case. He seems all too visibly damaged from the outset. Scorseses jittery camerawork cuts away from him elliptically and the dank lighting obscures him undermining DiCaprios ability to engage the viewers. Not until a humanizing 11th-hour return to daylight and everyday reality does he have a chance to fully touch our emotions. SHUTTER ISLAND  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating R for disturbing violent content language and some nudity. There are some fine supporting actors at work here. Ben Kingsley is formidable as Cawley the mental hospitals sinister-seeming chief psychiatrist. Emily Mortimer makes a fetching young psychopath and Patricia Clarkson registers powerfully in a single scene as a hermit who lucidly explains the insanity rampant on Shutter Island. Secondary characters cant carry a film alas. Perhaps recognizing the central story lines weakness Scorsese decorates the film with symbolic tableaux -- hypnotically rotating phonograph albums leaping flames flashbacks to Teddys role in the liberation of the Dachau concentration camp. These details are visually striking and might have worked if they grew organically out of the material but they feel artificial over-calculated and portentous. Light bulbs crackle to life with a sonic sting worthy of an electric chair; at other times ambient sound drops eerily out of the scene altogether. Characters in Teddys increasingly baroque visions crumble into dry ash or gush blood like hemorrhaging hemophiliacs. Because the main narrative isnt strong enough audiovisual flourishes become the dominant aspect of the film. Instead of a relentless buildup of claustrophobic terror we get eruptions of rats World War II massacres and naked madmen leaping out of the dark. Theres plenty of method in Scorseses approach but too little true madness.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Feb. 18 2010 452 PM Im Surrounded by Crazy People Leo DiCaprio scrunches his face in Martin Scorseses Shutter Island. By Dana Stevens After youve seen Shutter Island loosen your straitjacket and check out our Spoiler Special discussion You can also download the program here or you can subscribe to the Spoiler Special podcast feed via iTunes or directly with our RSS feed. Leonardo DiCaprio in Shutter Island From the first frames of Martin Scorseses Shutter Island (Paramount) something feels off. Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) two federal marshals on their way to a forbidding island off the Massachusetts coast seem like actors artificially transplanted from contemporary cinema into a quickie B-movie from the 1950s. When they reach the island the site of a high-security hospital for the criminally insane the setting is almost parodically gothic with high blocky cliffs thrashed by pounding waves a remote lighthouse sheltering unspeakable deeds and a Civil War-era fort filled with babbling inmates and sinister wardens. As the marshals investigation begins--one of the patients Rachel Solando (Emily Mortimer) has mysteriously disappeared from her cell--we dont know whether to prepare ourselves for a Silence of the Lambs-style psychological thriller or a Snake Pit-style expose of abuses in the mental health system. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The instability this first act establishes is entirely deliberate (which is not to say its entirely successful) Teddy Daniels cant make out what sort of island hes on and what the asylums officials have in mind for him; the audience cant make out what sort of movie were at and what Martin Scorsese has in mind for us. An important difference though is that Teddy is driven at the cost of his sanity to ferret out the islands dark secrets whereas we have a hard time working up the energy to care. Shutter Island is an aesthetically and at times intellectually exciting puzzle but its never emotionally involving. The movie is inert despite the fact that it bombards us with lurid imagery and high-intensity stimuli frozen Dachau victims dying Nazis beautiful child murderesses abandoned graveyards besieged by hurricanes. Set piece after set piece makes you go ""Holy mackerel"" but the entirety of the movie makes you go ""Whens dinner?"" Advertisement Its impossible to say much more about Shutter Islands story without starting to spoil the twists and this is a movie that lives and dies by its twists. The script adapted by Laeta Kalogridis from the novel by Dennis Lehane traces a Vertigo-esque spiral. At that spirals center is a revelation involving Teddys long-dead wife Dolores (Michelle Williams) thats meant to be searingly honest but that came off to this viewer as tawdry Grand Guignol. Im not sure I buy Elbert Venturas argument in Slatethat Scorsese is an establishment figure comfortably phoning it in. (Though I do agree with his premise that the great directors films have gone downhill in recent years. I havent loved a Scorsese movie without reservations since Goodfellas.) While its often not clear what Shutter Island is trying to do or be its made by an artist whos passionately engaged in his work. Nor is the movie a hollow exercise in style; Scorsese is out to ask the big questions as becomes clear in a ponderously theme-summarizing exchange between Teddy and an asylum official ""Theres no moral order at all. Theres only can my violence conquer yours?"" Shutter Islandsmethod of cinematic pastiche reads better on paper than it does up on screen. Watching it movie references pile up inside your brain Samuel Fullers Shock Corridor is in there certainly and the cheapo tone poems of the B-movie master Val Lewton. (Scorsese has acknowledged both men as influences.)  But theres also John Frankenheimer Alfred Hitchcock and in the visceral color-saturated dream sequences David Lynch. The use of music underscores this patchwork quality Rather than commission an original score Scorsese had Robbie Robertson of The Band (his frequent musical collaborator) put together a soundtrack made of bits and pieces from 20th-century composers from Marcel Duchamp () to Morton Feldman to Brian Eno. The problem isnt the multiplicity of influences and sources; its that we never understand to what purpose all this hectic citation is being deployed. Welcome faces pop up in secondary roles Ben Kingsley as the institutions ambiguously motivated director; Max von Sydow as an ex-Nazi psychiatrist; Jackie Earle Haley as a tormented but strangely lucid inmate; and tantalizingly briefly Elias Koteas (made up to look like a Robert De Niro double) as a guy who--well if I were to describe his existential status in the movie the whole game would be blown. But the fact that its energizing to see even a fake De Niros craggy face emerge from the shadows only points up the deficiencies of Scorseses leading man.  Advertisement Leonardo DiCaprio is not without talent but how did he come to be Martin Scorseses muse? The type of role Scorsese loves to craft for him is just the sort hes most unsuited to the anguished but streetwise tough guy with his collar turned up to the wind. Beneath the Robert Mitchum mannerisms and carefully cultivated Boston accent (dusted off from his role in 2006s The Depahted) DiCaprio still seems like a pudding-faced little boy alternately sullen and giddy a little too eager to be loved (his best performances to my mind are still in Whats Eating Gilbert Grape and Catch Me If You Can). The photo at the top of this review captures the classic expression of Leo trying too hard All his features migrate to the middle of his face and just sort of crouch there. In the movies press notes Patricia Clarkson (who appears briefly as an oracular figure in a cliffside cave) praises DiCaprios energy as an actor ""I loved working with him because he gives 2000% on every take."" If Marty insists on casting Leo as his leading man next time he should take him aside and advise him that thats 20 times too much. Become a fan of Slate  on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter.

"Shutter Island movie review Scorseses dark mystery allows DiCaprio to shine |       NJ.com comments Shutter Island movie review Scorseses dark mystery allows DiCaprio to shine Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on February 18 2010 at 331 PM updated February 18 2010 at 358 PM View/Post Comments Andrew CooperChuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo left) and Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio right) are two detectives sent from the mainland to investigate a mysterious disappearance on an island prison for the criminally insane in the thriller ""Shutter Island.""U.S. marshal Teddy Daniels is trying to crack a case and its a nightmare. Literally. Its not just that the puzzle is something out of a detective story -- a mental patient leaving a locked room and escaping an inescapable island -- its that its giving him bad dreams. Very bad dreams. But Teddy has his own dark history. And the secrets hes trying to uncover now only keep drawing him back to the painful memories that keep reaching out from his past. ""Shutter Island"" is the locale and the movie -- and its a surprising effort from Martin Scorsese on every level.Shutter Island (R) Paramount (140 min.) Directed by Martin Scorsese. With Leonardo DiCaprio Ben Kingsley Mark Ruffalo Michelle Williams. Now playing in New Jersey.Stephen Whittys rating Three starsRating note The film contains disturbing images violence strong language and alcohol abuse. Genre? Its a neo-Gothic thriller from a man whos always gravitated toward urban crime. Mood? Instead of exploding in rage this dives headfirst into sneaky suspicion. Style? An unusual embrace of CGI surrealism with lost loves who turn literally into ashes in your hands. Its as startling a change of pace for this director as ""The Shining"" was for Stanley Kubrick and often just as unnerving. Not perhaps as satisfying -- theres a big climactic twist in this tale (based on the novel by Dennis Lehane) that Im not sure I buy. (Its one of those endings that send fans trudging up the aisle muttering ""So wait then that means ..."") Its been a problem with a lot of Lehanes work. Theyre acclaimed best-sellers in print but turned into moving images they sometimes -- like ""Gone Baby Gone"" -- ask viewers to accept some very far-flung final explanations. Its no different here. Its the journey to that point though thats intriguing. Credit the actors for much of that. One of the great things about being a director like Scorsese -- or Quentin Tarantino or Woody Allen -- is that everyone wants to work with you. So ""Shutter Island"" is the kind of movie that can cast even red-herring parts with whales. Just take a look at the supporting actors some here for only a few scenes -- Michelle Williams Patricia Clarkson even the legendary Max von Sydow. (Theres no Robert De Niro true -- but a mischievous Scorsese includes him anyway by casting look-alike Elias Koteas). Theyre all superb. Its DiCaprio though who carries this. DiCaprio -- whose once open baby face has gotten reserved and boxy over the years -- creates a man here in genuine pain. Hes seasick. He has headaches. And he has the kind of nightmares that would have kept Ingrid Bergman in ""Spellbound"" busy for years. Its an angry anguished job (and a nice companion to his work in Scorseses ""The Departed"") -- and its put into fine relief by the complementary work by the rest of the cast. As his partner Mark Ruffalo draws on a screen persona of slightly untrustworthy passivity; as the chief of the asylum Ben Kingsley is all snobbish smiling menace. Do all the nightmarish images great actors and odd plot turns add up to great Scorsese? No. Like ""The Departed"" (or ""Cape Fear"" or ""The Color of Money"") this is merely very good Scorsese with the director not so much confronting his own dreams as interpreting someone elses. But even ""merely very good"" Scorsese is still miles away from most other directors best.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + With ""Shutter Island Martin Scorsese proves susceptible to the chic of filming a Dennis Lehane bestseller. Clint Eastwood turned ""Mystic River into lugubrious opera; Ben Affleck pumped ""Gone Baby Gone full of pulp. Surprisingly Scorsese divines Hitchcock in the competing genres of Lehanes book which trotted out psychological suspense grisly melodrama wartime horror and some risibly punning names while spinning a yarn about two federal marshals on the hunt for an escaped mental patient.Its an inspired extraction though not a terribly satisfying one. This is a long heavy film in which Scorseses aerobic moviemaking turns mannered and uncharacteristically passive. The movies big moments hinge on long explanations meant to clear everything up. But all the telling seems to neutralize Scorseses kinetic power.When Boston Detective Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) arrives at the movies title destination and begins poking around the islands mental hospital the script by the writer and producer Laeta Kalogridis always feels like its playing catch up retreating into flashbacks and dream sequences featuring Teddys dead wife Dolores (Michelle Williams) to keep the story moving forward.Ostensibly Teddy and his new partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) want to know how a murderous inmate vanished and where she is. The hospitals creepy top doctors played by Ben Kingsley and Max von Sydow with a wicked white crew cut arent much help. But the missing patient becomes beside the point. As was the case with Jimmy Stewart in ""Vertigo Anthony Perkins in ""Psycho and Tippi Hedren in ""Marnie the more crucial matter is Teddys increasingly unsteady state of mind. Apparently the man who set the fire that killed Dolores is also an inmate and Teddy is hell-bent on finding him too.Scorsese is at home with psychologically combustible men - Travis Bickle in ""Taxi Driver Jake LaMotta in ""Raging Bull and Rupert Pupkin in ""The King of Comedy. In ""Shutter Island Scorsese enjoys tracing his fingers along Teddys psychic fissures. The movie creeps into his brain and reveals a perverse vibrancy. His dream Dolores leaks water and dissolves into ash. Shes a ghostly figment and her blurry place in Teddys head intensifies.The movies embellishments are smart. There are terrific walk-ons by John Carroll Lynch as the Barney Rubble-ish deputy warden Ted Levine as his boss and Robin Bartlett as the chattiest man-killer youll ever meet. Robbie Robertson assembled the movies off-kilter noise orchestrations (Gyorgy Ligeti John Adams John Cage Nam June Paik) and Scorsese puts them to skin-crawling use. Working with his editor Thelma Schoonmaker he offers a master class in how to conjure horror sanely. The inmate with dilated pupils who holds a finger to her lips while looking at Teddy seems meant for the generation of boys who grind out horror films. The movie pulls further away from the palm-frond paradise printed on Teddys necktie.But to where is it pulling away? And more importantly why? Scorseses usual seamless synthesis of influences and styles feels patchy. He stages some WWII grisliness and scratches a few Asian horror tics during several scenes in which pale dead children go for walks. The kids are victims at the Dachau concentration camp the liberation of which Teddy participated in. And theres something gratuitous and distressingly cold in the way the camera gazes at the frozen corpses piled outside inert boxcars.Scorsese struggles to bring Teddys psychological combustibility and the movies historical terror to coherent or resonant life. Some of the problem is that despite the luridness and gore the film maintains a pristine suffocating atmosphere. Even in a work of fraught romantic oppression like 1993s ""The Age of Innocence or with a strange depressive allegory like 1999s underrated ""Bringing Out the Dead Scorseses filmmaking managed to descend into a visceral sort of madness. Serenity doesnt suit him. He seems medicated.Some of the trouble continues with his star. DiCaprio is hobbled by another shaky Boston accent and his endless adolescence keeps him from being a credible 1950s lawman and family man. He works as hard here as he always does but this time its like Holden Caulfield acting out his mental hospital years. Teddy turns out to be a sort of marionette. But theres nothing fun about DiCaprio allowing other people to pull his strings.Scorsese is too subdued to direct his way around the material. He and DiCaprio have to plow through it and its a slog. The second hour collapses into a marathon of explanations and its true that the actors doing the clarifying - Kingsley Ruffalo Elias Koteas Jackie Earle Haley and hidden way up in a rat-infested cave Patricia Clarkson - are entertaining. But watching them spell everything out for DiCaprio youre reminded that the last thing you want from a man with Scorseses great manic eye is a movie full of people who exist only to run their mouths.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Night Shyamalan.Set in 1954 on an island off Boston the film follows the investigation of U.S. Marshals Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) into the disappearance of a patient from the fortress hospital for the criminally insane.Atmospherically this psycho-thriller adapted from Dennis Lehanes 2003 novel makes a case that insanity is catching. On Shutter Island lights flicker pipes drip the iron bars in the cellblocks make ominous music. The sounds are underscored - and occasionally overscored if there is such a thing - by chilling dissonant passages from composers John Cage and John Adams completing the effect.Onto this haunted island storms Teddy himself haunted by the horrors witnessed when he liberated Dachau horrors compounded by the trauma of his wifes recent death in an apartment fire.Teddy sees crazy people. For him as for the movie audience its hard to distinguish insane from sane prisoner from patient.From the maniacal grins of shackled inmates to the enigmatic smiles of doctors (Ben Kingsley and Max von Sydow) everything Teddy sees triggers a disturbing memory. Still he soldiers on scouring the island for the escapee Rachel who killed her three children.Teddy is tightly wrapped. And the overlong (2 hours 18 minutes) film cant wait until he starts coming apart at the seams.DiCaprio the vertical furrow bisecting his brows growing deeper as the movie progresses looks to be compensating for the shallow material.There are many many fine performers here including the terrific Patricia Clarkson as the elusive Rachel. But Shutter Island is not so much a character study as it is an atmospheric thriller.Yes it briefly considers medical and political issues topical in 1954. Namely Is it better to lobotomize or medicate the insane? Whats the difference between healthy skepticism and unhealthy paranoia? But these are tactical diversions for Shutter Island is principally an exercise in mood and style.Working with gifted cinematographer Robert Richardson and visionary production designer Dante Ferretti Scorsese maximizes the creep-out factor of every tempest-tossed inch of Shutter Island where Teddys inner demons become externalized in geology and flesh.Fallen branches from trees crack underfoot like broken bones. The islands jagged slippery schist suggests the craggy shifty characters who live there. The dead haunt the living.And dead directors especially Hitchcock haunt the living Scorsese an original who here makes an unapologetically derivative film full of visual nods that appeal mostly to movie geeks.Most obviously Shutter Island has a shower scene like Psycho a haunted-stairway scene like Vertigo tweedy shrinks sipping brandy as in Spellbound and a rock-climbing cliffhanger like North by Northwest. Grad-level geeks will also recognize the references to Sam Fullers Shock Corridor Vincente Minnellis The Cobweb and Val Lewtons Isle of the Dead.I enjoyed the visuals including the backgrounds that looked deliberately faked like Hitchcocks and the ambiguous ending that will launch a thousand debates. In the Scorsese filmography Shutter Island is but a middling destination.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215 854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Based on Dennis Lehanes novel Martin Scorseses Shutter Island takes place in 1954 on a compound in the middle of Boston Harbor that specializes in the containment and care of the criminally insane. Its a fortress of almost abstract horror surrounded by cliffs on all sides and given to inclement weather including a hurricane that flattens trees and chips away at the mighty structure. In other words it isnt a setting designed for dramatic restraint. Using every tool at his disposal Scorsese honors Lehanes pulp intensity by amplifying the story to the fevered Grand Guignol of a Park Chan-wook movie or Sam Fullers asylum classic Shock Corridor. Theres a purpose to all this madness--though to talk about the primary reason the film succeeds would be giving the game away--but it should be appreciated first as a vivid waking nightmare. Doing only a minor variation on his tortured Bostonian from Scorseses The Departed Leonardo DiCaprio stars as a U.S. marshal summoned to Shutter Island after a female patient mysteriously disappears. As DiCaprio and his partner (Mark Ruffalo) make inquiries of the patients and staff theyre baffled first by the seeming impossibility of the woman leaving a locked cell and slipping past security and second by her escape off a rock that makes Alcatraz look like the county pen. All investigative avenues appear to lead to Ben Kingsley the Dr. Moreau of this experimental facility who treats his inmates as patients rather than criminals but seems to be hiding a darker agenda. For his part DiCaprio brings his own share of personal baggage Hes haunted by memories of liberating Dachau and his wifes death in an apartment fire. What begins as a simple missing-person procedural slowly morphs into full-on psychological horror as more disturbing revelations come to pass and the stress on DiCaprio starts eating away at his nerves. Scorsese renders his heros nightmares in vivid Technicolor flashbacks and dream sequences that insistently bleed into reality and cloud his judgment. Scorseses talent for aligning the audience with a single characters obsession pays off brilliantly as Shutter Island unfolds and potent single-scene turns by Jackie Earle Haley and Patricia Clarkson draw it further into the darkness. Shutter Island may initially seem like a nerve-jangling genre piece in the Cape Fear mold but its more like Scorseses The Shining a horror show where its sometimes hard to tell the haunted from those doing the haunting.

Comments (3) click to enlarge Shutter Island Recommended Video Rated R  138 minutes  2010 Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo star as federal marshals summoned to an island hospital for the criminally insane; a patient has gone missing but the more they question the doctors and staff the more they suspect something fishy is going on. With its period setting (the early 50s) and mystery plot (adapted from a novel by Dennis Lehane) this might sound like another genre romp for director Martin Scorsese along the lines of his Oscar-winning The Departed (2006). But the claustrophobic interiors the abrasive modern-classical score and the ugly mental labyrinths of the story combine to make this his grimmest movie since Taxi Driver (1976). It begins as a variation on Samuel Fullers Shock Corridor (without the laughs) and eventually turns into something more like Hitchcocks Vertigo (without the glamour); what Scorsese brings to the table having created more than his share of rascally villains is a renewed sense of horror and despair at the power of evil.

Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo play U.S. marshals investigating a creepy insane asylum in Shutter Island (Andrew Cooper) B Shutter Island Genre Mystery and Thriller Drama; Starring Leonardo DiCaprio Ben Kingsley Mark Ruffalo Max von Sydow Michelle Williams; Director Martin Scorsese; Author Laeta Kalogridis; Release Date Wide 02/19/2010; Runtime (in minutes) 138; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Paramount Pictures Posted February 18 2010 -- 1200 AM EST Back in 1991 when Martin Scorsese made Cape Fear he figured out how to direct an unabashed commercial thriller that still had the flavor of his obsessions. The movie had a steady tense nearly Hitchcockian pull (watch it again -- its better ? than you remember) but in Robert De Niros sneeringly nasty sociopathic redneck Max Cady it also had a figure of dark force that tied it to Scorseses earlier art-of-the-mean-streets masterpieces. Shutter Island a twisty gothic mental-asylum mystery set in 1954 primes you for some of that same triumphant Marty/Hollywood fusion. Adapting a novel by Dennis Lehane (Mystic River) Scorsese works in a smoothly deliberate pictorial mode reminiscent of the Hollywood noirs of the 50s and for a while that style is classically enjoyable. Early on Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) a U.S. marshal with narrowing eyes and a wary Boston edge takes a ferry to Shutter Island a rocky fortress off the coast of New England that houses a prison hospital for the criminally insane. The place is even more forbidding and isolated than Alcatraz and with good reason Nearly all of its 66 patients are violent psychopaths. Teddy is investigating the strange disappearance of one of them Rachel Solando who drowned her three children. As he questions doctors and inmates all under the ambiguous gaze of the institutions outwardly fastidious and liberal director (Ben Kingsley) it becomes clear that theres much more to this case than one vanished killer. Is there more to Shutter Island though than its steady visual/tonal craftsmanship and increasingly ? helter-skelter plot twists? What we want from this movie I think is a tricky and sophisticated mental-ward thriller that seduces us into a pleasurable vertigo of uncertainty. What we get is a tale dotted with vague portents of violence ""heavy"" themes (the ethics of psychotropic drugs the spectre of nuclear war) and surreal images of Teddys memories of his wife (Michelle Williams) who died in a fire set by a negligent superintendent. The super may now even be a patient. As if the movie didnt have enough backstory Teddy is also a WWII veteran haunted by flashbacks to the liberation of the Dachau death camp. On paper Shutter Island is a nicely convoluted puzzle -- The Shining with an extra helping of insanity. But Scorsese serves Lehanes puzzle more than he makes it his own. His style is like visual frosting laid on top of a maze as the film invites us to spend a plodding two hours and 18 minutes figuring out the method to its madness. Shutter Island holds you but it doesnt grip you. Its as if Scorsese had put his filmmaking fever on psychotropic drugs. He certainly gets an urgent performance out of DiCaprio who has the tricky task of looking more rattled and confused the more he discovers. There are also ace turns from Kingsley all watchful creepiness; Max von Sydow as an eminently sinister German psychiatrist; and Mark Ruffalo who as Teddys partner soft-pedals his usual testiness. Patricia Clarkson has a startling few minutes as an asylum refugee whos a beacon of desperate rationality. Shutter Island is a mystery thats out to summon a whiff of tabloid sensation and at times its almost too stately as if Scorsese thought the devices that propel the tale -- ?visions of the Holocaust murmurings of guilt and mind control -- made this a ""personal"" film. They dont. The movie does have a payoff though. And it works shiveringly well. Shutter Island is hokum passing itself off as more than hokum but its no accident that the resolution is so much better than the boggy middle. Only then can Scorsese stop pretending hes making something important.

Ben Kingsley Mark Ruffalo and Leonardo DiCaprio in Shutter Island which revels in B-movie cliches but lacks the substance that would put them to good use. (HO) Joe Neumaier Thursday February 18 2010 122 PM Title Shutter Island The fact that ""Shutter Island"" is at its core pure pulpy hogwash would be a disappointment no matter whose name was on it. But since this is Martin Scorseses first feature since winning his long-deserved Best Director and Best Picture Oscars three years ago for ""The Departed"" the movie is mind-boggling just not in the way youd think.It has of course been made with exquisite care -- Scorsese lovingly considers even the smallest details -- and there are few pretensions here. Yet what ultimately sticks in the mind is how hard the movie works for so little effect; its like watching a circus strongman pretending to exert himself lifting a Q-tip. For all the trickiness and bluster ""Shutter Island"" is dead inside.The year is 1954 and U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels (Scorseses four-time collaborator Leonardo DiCaprio) arrives with his partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) on the title island to locate an escapee from the Ashecliffe Hospital for the Criminally Insane. Chief psychoanalyst Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) tells Teddy the sole way to leave is on the hospitals ferry while all around the sprawling grounds hollow-eyed mad people and skittish attendants mill about and screams echo through the halls.As a ""Key Largo""-size hurricane approaches Teddy scours the dark corridors and finds clues hidden meanings and more sidelong glances than you can shake an ice pick at. To him Shutter Island hides conspiracies experiments and paranoia and if hes right the truth may never get out.Almost from the start Scorsese uses flashbacks and hallucinations to keep things off-kilter (a score that seems to sample garbage can lids scraping together helps too). However off-kilter is slowly revealed as the only speed offered with information dribbling out until an embarrassingly blunt exposition scene. DiCaprio confidently anchoring it all veers between tough and rattled. Though his performance is designed to be inscrutable he often simply mouths questions and waits for some B-movie tradition (the jabbering madman the German doctor the mystery woman) to provide apparent answers.Scorsese naturally loves those traditions and ""Shutter Island"" is one of his late-late movie nights of the soul his first since 1991s comparable ""Cape Fear."" In the two decades since hes done unrequited love mania obsessive ambition and dramas like this one about identity. New Yorks greatest filmmaker has no problem getting out of himself and into the mind of someone else. Its a shame that at the height of his popularity hes using his movie-god strength merely to rattle the cage.jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"Shutter Island review Schlock corridor - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs 2 starsShutter Island review Schlock corridorSlumming Scorsese strands his cast on a madly overheated islandFebruary 18 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticFor Martin Scorseses follow-up to the ""crazy"" (his word) Oscar-winning gangster picture ""The Departed"" the director has gone seriously bughouse with the thriller ""Shutter Island."" It is less a film than a puny trampoline -- an occasion though a grim one for this most fervently movie-mad of American directors to show off his love for the various pulp genres mooshed together by the 2003 Dennis Lehane novel. That book has been adapted faithfully for the screen by Laeta Kalogridis. Its mousetrap-like story however depends on a single major twist. Lehane managed to keep the secret a secret a good long while in the book. On screen directed by a maximalist like Scorsese that secret has a much harder time of it. ""Shutter Island"" is hysterical in the clinical and cinematic senses followed by plodding just when a potboiling contraption cannot afford to be. By design ""Shutter Island"" is as hermetic and artificial a construct as the directors own ""New York New York"" though the Scorsese film it most resembles in texture and sheer pulp hysteria is his remake of ""Cape Fear."" Recall the tempest-tossed houseboat climax of ""Cape Fear""? ""Shutter Island"" set in 1954 starts at roughly that pitch with U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels played as a simmering kettle of violence by Leonardo DiCaprio arriving at the Ashecliffe Hospital for the Criminally Insane. The most murderous patient on the island has escaped and with his amiable new partner (Mark Ruffalo) in tow Daniels investigates. All he finds are ghouls thugs and obstructionists including the shifty Dr. Cawley ( Ben Kingsley) whose clinic may harbor sinister doings in the name of progressive health care. Daniels a World War II veteran has his own problems The worst of what he saw at the Dachau concentration camp haunts his dreams as does the death of his wife ( Michelle Williams) an apparent victim of an arsonists match. DiCaprio brings a kind of generalized anguish to the role. Scorseses job here isnt direction Its redirection and misdirection. Thats all there is to this thing mazelike fun and games without the fun. Scorseses (and Lehanes) use of concentration camp horrors is specious at best offensive at worst. And while Scorsese has never been a stranger to pulp -- what is his masterwork ""Taxi Driver"" if not the most disturbing vigilante fever dream ever committed to film? -- I think this time hes slumming or rather overcompensating for slumming by overcooking the stew. Many admire the films flagrant and unceasing display of atmospheric virtuosity Scorseses camera is positively boom-happy craning this way and that when it isnt swish-panning right and left and right again. Cinematographer Robert Richardson pours his customary (and customarily hammy) hot white light down on the sweaty protagonist. In Samuel Fullers ""Shock Corridor"" (1963) an obvious influence on ""Shutter Island"" the reporters lover tells him hes crazy to enter the asylum in the name of a good story. ""Youre on a hopped-up showoff stage. Get off it"" she says. Scorsese has earned the right to show off on any stage he pleases. But not even supporting players as deft as Patricia Clarkson Jackie Earle Haley and Emily Mortimer can make this more than classy well-acted junk. mjphillipstribune.com MPAA rating R (disturbing violent content language and some nudity)Cast Leonardo DiCaprio (Teddy Daniels); Mark Ruffalo (Chuck Aule); Ben Kingsley (Dr. Cawley); Michelle Williams (Dolores); Patricia Clarkson (Rachel); Emily Mortimer (Rachel); Jackie Earle Haley (Noyce); Max von Sydow (Dr. Naehring)Credits Directed by Martin Scorsese; written by Laeta Kalogridis based on the novel by Dennis Lehane; produced by Mike Medavoy Arnold W.

Fans of Dennis Lehanes novel scrupulously adapted by screenwriter Laeta Kalogridis will find the fiendishly complicated story essentially intact In 1954 U.S. marshals Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) investigate the disappearance of a prisoner at an asylum for the criminally insane on a remote island. But the tone and mood of Shutter Island are different on the screen from on the page - the shadows darker than you imagined the violence more ghastly the blood redder. Shutter Island may have been conceived by Lehane but the movie is Scorseses show all the way. When a character says ""God loves violence. Why else would we have so much of it in us?"" he might as well be talking about Scorseses entire canon. For a thriller Shutter Island is unusually heavy on exposition. Teddy has a tragic complicated past that includes the death of his wife (Michelle Williams) in a fire set by an arsonist and his participation in the liberation of the Dachau concentration camp where he saw things that left irreparable scars. Scorsese uses flashbacks and dream sequences to fill us in on Teddys life and some - such as a long panning shot of Nazi soldiers being executed - rank among the best set pieces of his career. The rest of the movie is not quite up to that level. Shutter Island eventually gets so complicated that a character must sketch a quick summation on a blackboard - the result of a plot-driven movie by a director interested primarily in observing human behavior. Scorsese isnt emotionally connected to this material the way he was plugged into The Departed and Goodfellas and Raging Bull. Instead he seems to be out to explore the conventions of the horror genre as in Cape Fear and to pay homage to his heroes while coming up with a few new tricks. A lot of Val Lewton spookiness permeates Shutter Island along with a strong Hitchcockian undertone (emphasized by some beautifully artificial process shots) about the realities people sometimes invent when they cant deal with their own. This is DiCaprios fourth collaboration with Scorsese and in many ways the most intense and taxing given that the actor plays a tortured haunted man who must hold our attention even though we dont come to understand him until the movies closing moments. The more Teddy investigates the shady goings on at the asylum which is presided over by a not-always-cooperative doctor (Ben Kingsley) the more convinced he becomes that things are not as they appear. Why do the institutions guards seem to itch for any excuse to use their weapons? What is the meaning of the puzzling note the missing prisoner left behind in her cell? Could the staff be conducting medical experiments on the patients? And why does a hurricane have to bear down on the island in the middle of Teddys investigation? Everything but the freak weather pattern is satisfactorily resolved by the end of Shutter Island and the hurricane gives Scorsese the chance to stage several scenes in which the lightning wind and rain thrash in the background. Youve never seen a dark and stormy night quite like this one. Aided considerably by a score of sinister classical music supervised by Robbie Robertson - a score that makes you fear something awful is always about to happen - Shutter Island is popcorn entertainment polished to an unusually high sheen. Yes you could argue the movie is simply a mood piece. But what a mood. Posted by Rene Rodriguez at 0321 PM in Film Reviews | Permalink The Miami Herald Copyright 2010 The Miami Herald.

Posted by chuchi | February 17 2010 at 0352 PM Thanks for the info. I will fix that right now. Posted by Rene Rodriguez | February 17 2010 at 0444 PM Is Robert De Niro in this movie? I saw the preview and I swear he looked like the guy with the big stitch across his face....If so then im definately watching this on friday Posted by Jorge | February 17 2010 at 0630 PM That wasnt De Niro. Its Elias Koteas. Although he does look a lot like him in the trailers. Posted by R | February 17 2010 at 0709 PM Rene Rodriguez is the worst movie critic ever I have foundout that when he says a movie is bad it is a good movie and vice versa Posted by mick | February 18 2010 at 0545 AM To mick - I dont know if thats true; however in this case youre very wrong. According to Rotten Tomatoes out of 36 professional critic reviews the film has garnered 25 ""fresh"" votes which means positive. Posted by wolfgang731 | February 18 2010 at 1054 AM mick is the worst commenter ever I have foundout that when he comments he adds absolutely nothing to the conversation nor does he back up his nebulous complaints also he doesnt use punctuation unless it is an exclamation point Im really looking forward to this one. Ive been craving a good thriller and if it stays true to the book then its going to be great. Posted by rebekah | February 18 2010 at 1059 AM When you hand material like this to someone like Scorcese its always going to be good. I agree w/ Renes assessment. In the end its just moody popcorn fun but definitely worth seeing - even if youve already read the book. Great cast too. Posted by cant fight this feeling anymore | February 19 2010 at 0841 AM The book itself is just plain good fun entertainment. I am glad that the script will be faithful to the book. Love Scorcese and thouroghly ejoyed the book so I look forward to a great movie going experience. Mick absolute statements like the one about Rene make you look like an absolute fool. Rene I dont always agree with you but always enjoy your reviews. Dont let the haters/trolls get you down. Posted by Love the Books amp; the Flicks amp; the chicks | February 19 2010 at 1250 PM Nice review Rene Havent read the novel and dont know anything about the movie other than what Ive seen on the trailers. Having said that when one combines a director of Scorseses caliber along with a Hitchcok theme this can only mean that the DiCaprio character is actually a patient on the island living out some kind of delusion. Hope Im wrong but nothing really surprises me anymore (too many movies I guess). Havent been caught off guard with an ending since The Sting and The Crying Game. Posted by OC Dolphin | February 19 2010 at 1021 PM Gotta agree about the hurricane part. Its such a tight movie otherwise but theres no logical reason for it? Was it a real hurricane or was it fake? Either way it doesnt add much to the plot. Posted by Leif | March 24 2010 at 0314 PM For those who thought the movie wasnt ""tight"" watch it a second time. Everything -- I mean EVERYTHING -- is explained (even the storm). Scorseses attention to detail is amazing. Posted by Displaced Cane | July 11 2010 at 1248 PM The comments to this entry are closed.

Shutter Island Good Director Martin Scorsese. Cast Leonardo DiCaprio Ben Kingsley Mark Ruffalo. Rating Rated R for disturbing violent content language and some nudity. RELATED Ben Kingsley Acting out Martin Scorsese is up to tricks on Shutter Island Spotlight Leonardo DiCaprio Spotlight Ben Kingsley Prison movies Its not a great movie so much as it is great moviemaking. Its basically a potboiler genre film a B-movie with big talent attached. But the care love and astounding skill of director Martin Scorsese along with the claustrophobic story (based on the novel by Dennis Lehane) combine for a film that stays with you long after youve given up trying to figure out whether everything youve just seen really adds up. It doesnt matter. For more than two hours the audience is submerged in a world of increasing madness shot and directed in such a way as to be almost tactile. A storm and hurricane figure into the story; at times youll want to reach for a raincoat. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Teddy Daniels a federal marshal who arrives seasick at Shutter Island an isolated hospital for the criminally insane to try to find a missing woman institutionalized there after she drowned her three children. Teddy is accompanied by his new deferential partner Chuck (Mark Ruffalo) of whom he knows practically nothing. Once on the island theyre subjected to the rules of the place No weapons and everyone defers to Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) the psychiatrist who more or less runs the place. Teddy like Cawley is mystified as to how the woman could have gone missing since the hospital is so tightly - and creepily - guarded. To make matters more difficult Cawley and Dr. Naehring (Max von Sydow) wont allow Teddy to look at patient information; instead he has to conduct interviews with the patients which lead nowhere. Or do they? It turns out that Teddy has other reasons for wanting this case. His wife (Michelle Williams seen in flashback) was killed in a fire and he believes the man responsible is on the island as well. He is beset by memories of his wife as well as nightmares of his service in World War II in which he helped liberate a death camp (something that does nothing to make him think any more fondly of Naehring). A storm rages outside and is quickly turning into a hurricane; the ferry back to the mainland is shut down. Teddy is blinded by migraines. His suspicions mount - as do ours. The mystery here is not as compelling as Scorseses telling of it. The terrible beauty of the storm the creepiness of the surroundings the unease intensified by the patients who for the most part lurk about the margins make for an unsettling experience - and a wholly enjoyable one as well. DiCaprio who does his best work with Scorsese is very good; youll just have to trust me because to say how and why would give too much away. Kingsley is satisfyingly difficult to read. The same can be said of Ruffalo. Ted Levine is fantastic in a brief scene as the warden explaining his theory of mans true nature to Teddy. For a while now Scorsese has seemed more interested in making entertainments than searing personal statements such as ""Taxi Driver"" or ""Raging Bull."" ""Goodfellas"" bridged the gap. Certainly ""The Departed"" his last non-documentary feature which won Oscars for best picture and finally best director for Scorsese falls into the former category. And thats fine - as long as you make entertainments as well-crafted as ""Shutter Island."" If its not destined to be ranked among Scorseses greatest films its certainly one of his more-entertaining ones. And thats plenty good enough.

Shutter Island is not one of them. Dense ridiculously overplotted and painfully overlong this gruesome thriller set in a fogbound insane asylum is incomprehensible and fatally flawed but having said all of that I will also say this It never seems anything less than the work of a skillful film buff. Mr. Scorsese may be a smart aleck but hes a professional smart aleck. Teaming with frequent collaborator Leonardo DiCaprio (The Departed) and writer Dennis Lehane (Clint Eastwoods Mystic River) the director returns to the Boston of both films to try his hand at the hair-raising thriller genre. The year is 1954 at the height of the red-baiting Communist terror of the Cold War (a time nobody cares about anymore although important to the plot). Out of the fog a ferry boat materializes carrying two federal marshals named Teddy (a seasick DiCaprio) and Chuck (Mark Ruffalo) who are on their way to the remote Shutter Island off the Massachusetts coast to find a dangerous female patient who has escaped from Ashcliffe an asylum for the criminally insane. Almost immediately they are confronted by gothic horrors inspired by Titicut Follies and plunged into a Thorazine nightmare that fishes for logic with a red herring on the end of every hook. From the evil staff of resident doctors led by Ben Kingsley and especially Max von Sydow as a Nazi who may have performed medical experiments at Dachau to the escaped psychopath who murdered her three children (Emily Mortimer) the two cops are up to their Humphrey Bogart hats in paralyzing terror. Its 11 miles to the nearest land and the water surrounding the island is subzero. Since the terrain is overgrown with poison ivy and thorns escape on foot is impossible and the woman theyre tracking down was wearing no shoes. Meanwhile Mr. DiCaprio seems none too stable himself migraine headaches and flashbacks to Hitler concentration camps and his dead wife (Michelle Williams) who burned to death in a fire but keeps returning in dreams wandering through rooms of falling ashes. That kind of thing. Thickening the gumbo Mr. Scorsese adds more patients--the firebug who killed her; a female psychiatrist hiding in a cave; and various frightened prisoners chained to their cells in the violent ward who claim that the hospital (financed by the House of Un-American Activities Committee) is doing to the patients on Shutter Island what the Nazis did at Dachau. Maybe I missed something in political science but why would the Communists team up with the fascists just to send Lillian Hellman to jail? While the movie becomes more preposterous by the micro-minute Mr. DiCaprio is confronted with the realization that he cant trust anybody; one (or both) of the cops is an imposter. Cue the rainstorm with howling gale-force winds and thrashing blinding lightning--and you wonder how Karloff and Lugosi stayed out of this one. Mr. Scorsese cuts between the down-to-earth criminal investigation and the surrealism of the psychological nightmares with so much creepy detail that you can no longer separate fantasy from reality. The storm builds to a hurricane right out of a Dorothy Lamour movie and you wait with anxiety to enter the dreaded lighthouse where the doctors perform prefrontal lobotomies on stubborn patients by driving ice picks through their brains. Mr. DiCaprio is the next victim. From here Shutter Island is less like One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest and more like The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. How could this many talented people get so utterly confoundingly messed up? How could a director considered such an icon make so much money and demonstrate so little control? He knows where to put the camera and what to do with actors in numbingly worthless roles (what are Jackie Earle Haley and Patricia Clarkson doing here?) and I really admire him for the work hes done to preserve classic films and teach unschooled directors what simple straight-ahead narrative filmmaking is all about. But Marty-love has created a disturbing dark side. Now hes blended the elements he loves in film noirs and horror genres with mainstream moviemaking to the detriment of movies. The result may appeal to vacant-eyed Scorsese fans too arrogant or embarrassed to admit they dont have a clue whats going on here. It looks like a committee made it up every day as they went along; when it still didnt work in time for Christmas 2009 he went back into the editing lab and screwed it up some more. Too bad. Before it completely self-destructs Shutter Island keeps you riveted. I dont mind telling you that this is usually my kind of movie. If only it made sense. The first hour is as savagely disturbing as any horror movie ever seen but after more than two and a half hours the ice cubes Shutter Island sends through the bloodstream begin to defrost. In the end you feel lost and doomed and you will never know why. Either Mr. DiCaprio is the victim of an elaborate conspiracy-theory plot or hes been insane for years already. The theme is insanity and by the time this ordeal ends you get the feeling its catching. rreedobserver.com Comment Filed under Leonardo DiCaprio Martin Scorsese Michelle Williams Movie Review On the Town Shutter Island Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture The (Real) Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia Origin Story Culture No Alarms No Surprises Why Buying Concert Tickets Is a Rigged System Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP,http://www.observer.com/2010/culture/shudder-island,200,shutterisland32,shutterisland,observer

The film is his prolonged purging with Daniels coughing up chunks of his backstory in flashback and dream. Now topside he joins his new partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) and their destination looms into view an ominous hunk of rock in Boston Harbor that houses Ashecliffe Asylum where theyve been assigned to find a missing inmate. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Pounded eighth notes by Krzysztof Penderecki score a gathering-storm approach that anticlimaxes at a tidy ecclesiastical-looking brick campus. Theyre shown the grounds by progressive chief physician Dr. Cawley (Sir Ben Kingsley) who manages to seem both a natty patrician liberal circa 1954 and a bit of a satyr with his Anton LaVey bald head/goatee combo and ironic twinkle--an ambiguous balance Kingsley keeps seesawing throughout. They also meet Cawleys colleague Herr Doktor Naehring (Max von Sydow)--and Daniels an ex-GI who witnessed the liberation of Dachau takes an immediate dislike to the German.As Daniels and Aule begin to investigate theres a sense that their presence is an inside joke with the staff that theyre being given rehearsed misinformation. Daniels reveals that hed heard sinister rumors about Ashecliffe long before this assignment and not even a pretense of cooperation and normalcy can outlast their first hurricane-force dark-and-stormy-night on the island when they trade their soaked civvies for orderly uniforms. (The film is elemental whipped with fire ash snow paper bracken and torrents of rain.)As the outline of a conspiracy comes into view Danielss digging brings on strobing headaches hallucinations and a shrinking list of trustworthies that ultimately includes only his dead wife dolorous Dolores visiting him as a beyond-the-grave Technicolor prophet (Michelle Williams not quite right for ""ethereal""; it doesnt help that shes upstaged by Emily Mortimers psychopath who takes only one scene opposite DiCaprio to establish an immediate and spellbinding intimacy). As for DiCaprio well hell never step onscreen and immediately suggest a liver-and-onions Greatest Generation Ralph Meeker he-man--Ted Levines warden almost eats him at one point--but he has made suffering a specialty and does so with an abandon that is frightening.Production design maestro Dante Ferrettis island is a rugged symbolist mythscape pocketed with hidden places soothsayers sea caves Ward C a squat Civil War-era fort where the most violent offenders are kept in a Goya madhouse and beyond it the ultimate locked door--to the lighthouse Scorseses return to his Roger Corman AIP roots is an object lesson in the proximity of high and low culture--Shutter Island is lousy with modernist references soundtracked by avant-garde 20th-century composers pretentious in the best Pulp-y tradition.138 minutes is dangerously epic for a talky thriller but you forget the time and even whether the plot makes sense--and if you dont notice it doesnt matter. Since more attention has gone into filigreeing details into each scene than worrying about the way theyll fit together the rattletrap engages you moment-to-moment even as the overall pacing stops and lurches alarmingly.Though the film takes place entirely out-to-sea the mainland isnt left behind--its concentrated here into a midcentury chamber of manmade horrors. Loonies praise their island as a safe haven from news ""about atolls about A-bombs."" There are rumors suggesting the House Committee on Un-American Activities () is dabbling in brainwashing experiments. Daniels flashes back repeatedly to Dachau a camp Kapo choking in his own blood; a firing line tracking shot popping with squibs like a string of firecrackers; piled corpses frozen into a horrible sculpture. No violence is unsuitable for aestheticization; at one point in the films web of visions the perpetrator of a triple filicide points proudly to her handiwork and says ""See arent they beautiful?""--and DP Robert Richardsons image concurs.Scorsese is as famous a movie lover as a moviemaker. This is manifest in his too-much-discussed homages but also in his understanding of how his characters have themselves been shaped by entertainment how they model themselves as actors in the American drama--Rupert Pupkin in The King of Comedy or Bill the Butcher addressing his public with Edwin Forrest brio at a performance of Uncle Toms Cabin in Gangs of New York. (The announced Scorsese project The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt dealing with our nations premier self-publicist ham has enormous potential.) Without revealing too much of an ending that everyone will soon insist on telling you their opinion of Shutter Island deep in its camp gothic trappings seems to me a flea-pit occult history with Danielss headspace a confusion of ""Hideous Secrets of the Nazi Horror Cult"" schlock hard-ass Mickey Spillane machismo Cold War psychic confusion and the post-traumatic bad dreams of ex-servicemen.In his documentary Personal Journey Scorsese spoke of the 50s as a time ""when the subtext became as important as the apparent subject matter or even more important""--and in Shutter Island his most distinctly 50s movie he replays the trash culture of the era as the manifestation of an anguished subconscious.1 Leo the lionParamount Pictures Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Nick Pinkerton Follow Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

Expert screw-turning narrative filmmaking put at the service of old-dark-madhouse claptrap ""Shutter Island"" arguably occupies a similar place in Martin Scorseses filmography as ""The Shining"" does in Stanley Kubricks. In his first dramatic feature since ""The Departed"" Scorsese applies his protean skill and unsurpassed knowledge of Hollywood genres to create a dark intense thriller involving insanity ghastly memories mind-alteration and violence all wrapped in a story about the search for a missing patient at an island asylum. A topnotch cast headed by Leonardo DiCaprio looks to lead this Paramount release postponed from its original opening date last fall to Feb. 19 to muscular returns in all markets. As Kubrick did with Stephen Kings novel Scorsese uncustomarily ventures here into bestseller territory that obliges him to deliver certain expected ingredients for the mass audience and adhere to formula more than has been his nature over the years. Although ""The Departed"" and ""Cape Fear"" come close ""Shutter Island"" is the film that most forces the director to walk the straight and narrow in terms of carefully and clearly telling a story; if testing himself within that discipline was his intention this most devoted of cinema students among major American directors gets an ""A."" He also chose his material well. Dennis Lehanes 2003 novel is quite a few notches above the norm for mass-market popular fiction; ingeniously structured and populated with a rogues gallery of intriguing deceptive characters the book is a real page-turner spiked with game-changing twists which draws upon perfectly legitimate medical legal historical and political issues. It even offers an ending sufficiently ambiguous enough to inspire genuine debate. At its heart however its still a potboiler smartly fashioned to yank the reader this way and that while providing a veneer of moral inquiry for respectabilitys sake. The script by Laeta Kalogridis (an exec producer on ""Avatar"" said to have worked closely with James Cameron on developing the project) faithfully hews to the letter and spirit of Lehanes tome leaving Scorsese and his top-drawer collaborators with the largely technical task of crafting a drum-tight suspenser that wont take on too much water via the many memory flashbacks and surprise developments. Working in a format that recalls the moody low-budget horror mysteries of the 1940s produced at RKO by Val Lewton -- most pointedly ""Isle of the Dead"" and ""The Seventh Victim"" but in a far more visually vivid and explicit style -- Scorsese employs an exquisite modern equivalent of old-fashioned process work to show U.S. Marshals Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio) and Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) chugging the 11 miles on a ferry between Boston and the eponymous island thats home to Ashecliffe Hospital Warned by welcoming deputy warden (the excellent John Carroll Lynch) that the place houses only ""the most dangerous damaged patients"" the two men get an eyeful of weird zombie-like inmates doing menial work around an institution that resembles an impenetrable fortress -- because it was built as one for use during the Civil War. Its a heavy deeply ominous place outfitted by production designer Dante Ferretti to instill not only menace but also unease and anxiety; its deliberately made difficult for Teddy and Chuck as well as for the viewer to understand the proximity of one place to another to know where one stands literally and figuratively to decide where its safe and where its not. Cloaking the mood is the pervasive disquiet of the Cold War tension of 1954. This makes it harder to get a handle on the task at hand which is finding Rachel Solando the murderer of her three children who somehow escaped from her tiny room got past guards and presumably made her way out onto the island. The man in charge Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) is elegant erudite and helpful albeit only up to a point and after interviewing staff and patients Teddy and Chuck begin to feel theyre on a fools errand. But there are forces that keep the men on the rocky densely forested island. Teddy a grizzled World War II vet tormented by the fiery death of his wife (Michelle Williams in flashbacks) two years before -- as well as by visions of the corpses he found at Dachau upon helping liberate the concentration camp -- finds a cryptic note left by Rachel in her room that drives him forward. He may have hidden reasons of his own for sticking around. Then theres a gathering storm which cuts off telephone and ferry service even before reaching full hurricane-level intensity. One can rest assured that Teddy is not alone in concealing secret motives and agendas. In fact everyone has them and beginning an hour in they are parcelled out in astutely measured doses to keep you hanging on to the very end. Along the way there are encounters with a brilliant doctor with a suspicious German accent (Max von Sydow); a perilous descent into the bowels of the notorious Ward C home to the worst of the worst; rising suspicions about what really goes on in this place and accompanying doubt as to whether anyone who arrives on Shutter Island ever is allowed to leave. This is high-end popcorn fare adorned with a glittering pedigree by a powerhouse cast and crew. DiCaprio appears deeply into his role; a lot is asked of him physically and emotionally and his battle-and-tragedy-scarred veteran embodies a tangible anguish. Ruffalo is ideally cast as the older but junior agent who takes a lighter approach to serious matters. If this story had been made in the heyday of noir Kirk Douglas could have played Teddy and Robert Mitchum would have been a perfect Chuck. Kingsley and von Sydow bring their smooth confidence to bear on their roles as institution big shots while Jackie Earle Haley and Patricia Clarkson score in their individual big scenes. But the greatest interest lies in the craftsmanship which is provided in spades by Ferretti cinematographer Robert Richardson visual effects and second-unit overseer Rob Legato costume designer Sandy Powell editor Thelma Schoonmaker and dozens of others. Even when its clear Scorsese has decided to employ fakery and allow it to be obvious its done with elegance and beauty. Of at least equal interest is the soundtrack supervised by Robbie Robertson which employs mostly modern serious and classical music in the same manner of intelligent sampling that Scorsese normally uses rock and borrowed movie compositions. The sudden infusions of discordant atonal and otherwise unsettling passages by Ligeti Penderecki Cage Adams and more traditionally Mahler among numerous others further amplifies the sought-after climate of malignant ambiguity.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Intimate Malice The mind games of Jacques Audiards chilling prison drama A Prophet and Scorseses Shutter Island. _ By David Edelstein Published Feb 15 2010 ShareThis (Photo Roger Arpajou/Courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics) Jacques Audiards febrile engrossing prison thriller A Prophet opens the way tragedies often close with a man forced to choose between his life and his soul. Malik (Tahar Rahim) a 19-year-old French Arab is ordered by the prisons most powerful inmate the aging Corsican mobster Cesar Luciani (Niels Arestrup) to seduce and slit the throat of a fellow Arab. The teen tries everything (blowing the whistle getting himself thrown into solitary confinement) to keep from becoming a killer but Cesar is almighty and so Malik learns (with much dribbled blood) to conceal a razor in his cheeks and leap from his knees and swing for the jugular. The fatal encounter when it comes is gruelingly prolonged the victim kind and attentive the violence clumsy and garish the aftermath chilling. Although he has always been nonreligious and unaffiliated (he grew up in state institutions) Malik is suddenly more than ever a man without a country protected by Corsicans who call him a dirty Arab despised by Arabs who call him a craven Corsican. But then slowly the illiterate Malik learns to readnot just books but the prison itself and the world beyond. With stealth and subtlety he begins to move between the two cultures and to correctsometimes brutallythe imbalance of his life. Audiard is not exactly a cockeyed optimist but something inside him fights the bleak scenarios to which hes drawn. He remade James Tobacks fatalistic fever dream Fingers as the romantic relatively upbeat The Beat That My Heart Skipped and in A Prophet he seems to be turning De Palmas Scarface inside out and finding the core of self-actualizing inspiration that no climactic hail of bullets could puncture. After Maliks first murder Rahims face turns hard yet you can feel the characters brain ticking; you can read him reading others. Audiards camera is extraordinarily intimate The boundaries disappear between the real and the surreal. Malik lies on his cot beside the man he long ago killed and we accept that the connection is indelible. The murder was the primal injury from which all else flows. A Prophet isnt another of those washed-out blue-gray prison pictures. The colors are warm and saturated the vistas wide. Its a long film (more than two and a half hours) and when Malik is allowed to leave the prison for twelve hours at a time and begins to form alliances with Italian Corsican and Egyptian gangsters the connections are hard to follow. Thats the price you sometimes pay though for filmmakers who zig and zag and resist clicking into an established groove. Rahim is an exciting unpredictable presence and Arestrups Cesar has a stature thats nearly Shakespearean. As his cronies leave him behind his mask of malevolence slips and we glimpse the desperate bereft old fool. If A Prophet preaches anything its the value of self-reliance. See Also Scorcese on Collaborating With DiCaprio Some great directors as they age strive to simplify and refine their technique in the hope of getting closer to their subjects but Martin Scorsese has happilyperhaps even with reliefmoved into a long and not so emotionally taxing formalist phase (with fat studio paychecks). He seems to have been drawn to Shutter Island by the chance to quote from quasi-horror asylum B movies like Shock Corridor and Bedlam and to play the kind of straight-ahead illusion-versus-reality games he leaped clean over in his early expressionist masterpieces Mean Streets and Taxi Driver. Dennis Lehanes novel about a Boston detective who travels to an insane asylum on a craggy island to investigate the disappearance of a female patient is a doodle a Paul Auster Lite breather between his tortured Mystic River and the panoramic The Given Day. But Scorsese draws it out to two hours and twenty minutes of Hitchcock-like tracking shots and bombastic music and shrieking storms and detectives in long coats and fedoras trudging past leering mental patients. Its all deliberately artificial of course and the fifties noir tropes do gradually morph into something weirder and more hallucinatory. But even when the detective-story foundation begins to crumble and the gumshoe protagonist (Leonardo DiCaprio) becomes racked with visions of concentration camps and bloody children and babbles about Communist subversives and Nazi experiments Shutter Island is still suffocatingly movieish. DiCaprio had a breakthrough in the much-maligned Revolutionary Road He sanded off some layers of polish and dared to be raw wobbly in the moment. Hes every bit as good herehes just not very interesting. He trudges around with his sidekick (Mark Ruffalo) interviewing characters played by great actors pretending to be bad actors (only Ruffalo and Ben Kingsleys strangely paternal psychiatrist are fun to watch) and its all setup for the big reveal of the last 25 minutes. The ending is powerful (it should be given how Scorsese lingers on the corpses of little kids) but Shutter Island is a long slog. The sad thing is that Scorsese could have connected emotionally with Lehanes narrative. Without spelling things out the story comes down to whether fierce self-dramatization can lead to revelation catharsis and healinga question raised obliquely in Taxi Driver and Raging Bull. But Scorsese cant get past the thicket of old movies. Hes farther from reality than his hero is. A Prophet Sony Pictures Classics. R. Shutter Island Paramount Pictures. R. Share this story...
