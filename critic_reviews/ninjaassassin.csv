Starring Rain Naomie Harris Director James McTeigue Release Opened Nov 25 2009  Editorial Review Ninja Assassin drowns in really bad bloodBy Dan KoisWednesday Nov. 25 2009Near the end of ""Ninja Assassin"" a brutally violent swordplay saga European law-enforcement officers attack an ancient mountaintop ninja compound. Humvees rip through rice-paper walls and black-clad swordsmen face off against commandos wielding rocket launchers. The mayhem that ensues is not unlike ""Ninja Assassin"" itself an example of artless pointless Western might -- in this case the Wachowski brothers the directors of the ""Matrix"" trilogy and producers of this film -- attacking an Eastern tradition -- the ninja movie -- with advanced technology and a whole lot of money. Needless to say little survives the assault.""Ninja Assassin"" directed by James McTeigue posits that there are nine clans of deadly uh ninja assassins each made up of warriors trained since childhood in the ancient art of slicing dudes in half with swords. One of the deadly killers Raizo has fled his clan and is hiding in Berlin no longer comfortable with killing gangsters and politicians in exchange for a hundred pounds of gold.Raizo may no longer be a member of the Clan of the Black Sand but he retains his super ninja powers -- and his devastating cheekbones. Since Raizo is played by the South Korean pop star Rain the audience is treated to lovingly photographed training sequences in which a glistening shirtless Rain performs for example handstand push-ups on a bed of screwdrivers. With his long hair and matinee-idol looks he cuts quite a profile in ""Ninja Assassin."" ""He looks like he belongs in a boy band"" grouses one Europol higher-up when he oh-so-briefly detains Raizo in between bloodbaths.With the help of Mika a credulous Europol agent (played by a game Naomie Harris) Raizo attempts to bring down his former clan and its cruel master Ozunu. In flashback we witness how orphaned Raizo was raised by Ozunu and trained to become a heartless killing machine. (""Hate weakness in others"" Ozunu growls. ""Hate it in yourself"") That Ozunu is played by the legendary Sh Kosugi -- the star of early-80s pajama-clad spectaculars like ""Enter the Ninja"" and ""Revenge of the Ninja"" -- indicates that McTeigue and the Wachowskis view ""Ninja Assassin"" as a serious attempt to update those movies for contemporary audiences.And they have although not necessarily for the better. So the fight sequences in ""Ninja Assassin"" feature buckets of blood and a slew of slow-motion acrobatics. McTeigue (a Wachowski protege and the director of ""V for Vendetta"") substitutes gore and slick camera moves for the verve and style of his predecessors.Ten minutes after you leave the movie all the battles will have blended in your memory into a ceaseless muddle of sliced-off appendages jets of blood splashing artfully on walls gurgling screams and flashing swords. The only exception is a quick dramatic mano a mano between Raizo and another ninja in Mikas darkened apartment the two frightening creatures illuminated only by the agents shaking flashlight. Its a rare moment of visual wit in a movie that provides plenty of jolts but precious little pleasure.Kois is a freelance reviewer.Ninja Assassin (99 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for strong bloody violence and language.

He gets sliced to the bone by whirling blades is blasted unconscious by stun guns and does handstands on a bed of nails. I sat through ""Old Dogs."" Korean pop singer Rain plays Raizo a child raised in the worlds coolest orphanage Chores include learning to maim and slash the other children who are being raised to be ninja assassins by their dark master Lord Ozunu. These orphans dont beg unless its to say ""Please sir I want some more whoop-ass."" Despite all this happy carnage -- the arterial spray throughout is of lawn-sprinkler force and many a wall exists only to get Jackson Pollocked with bright red viscous goo -- Raizo comes to doubt his brethren. The outfit considers membership to be nonrevocable though and sends dedicated field representatives out to explore the possibility of carving Raizo into Raisinets if possible while inflicting extravagant doses of pain. The evil ninjas seem to be unaware of exactly who it is they are dealing with Raizo once spent a year training blindfolded which is exactly how I wish I had seen ""Old Dogs."" He also devises an ingenious way to fend off a ninja kill technique disguised as clean laundry. Meanwhile in Berlin a police forensics analyst (Naomie Harris) begins looking into a network of something or other involving a trail of yada yada that leads wherever. Her group Europol goes after the ninjas including Raizo but one cop makes a big mistake when he brazenly refers to the ninjas as ""a few whack jobs wearing pajamas."" No thats conservative bloggers. Europol becomes a target of the rest of the Ozunus who cant allow anyone to jump the queue when it comes to torturing Raizo. The forensics expert though joins forces with Raizo after receiving a warning letter containing the evil ninjas trademark black sand. I can tell her that an invitation to attend a screening of a new Disney movie that stars Robin Williams would have been equally unsettling. ""Ninja Assassin"" which is bloodier than peak hour at the abattoir offers about 21/2 films worth of roaring action -- Raizo is so handy with a chain that surrounding ninjas fall like dandelions against a weed whacker -- played with an earnest B-movie fervor. Despite the pace though -- pedal have you met my friend metal? -- ""Ninja Assassin"" still has some of its best stuff left at the end when the master returns to demonstrate his extra-special super-most-deadliest technique. This movie knows exactly what it is Gonzo silliness about bodies turned into human salsa.

Redundancy aside having braved zombies in 28 Days Later Naomie Harris now faces a centuries-old clan of ninjas who have been hiring themselves out Blackwater-style as government mercenaries. Sad to say the undead were more fun. Directed by James McTeigue (V for Vendetta) and with Joel Silver and the Wachowskis as producers Ninja Assassin is a hard-R blood-fest with much CG and many severed limbs. Eurocop Harris discovers the ninjas secret role in black-ops history so naturally they come after her--thats the entire plot. But one Bourne-like rogue ninja (South Korean pop star Rain) does try to protect her from the silent swarm of sword-wielding assassins. (Strict traditionalists ninjas here appear incapable of driving using guns or cell phones or smiling.) Because however ninjas love the shadows and abhor the light most of their battles are murky and difficult to follow. (Try to count the screams arterial geysers and fallen limbs then do the math; the ninjas always win.) With a passable smirk 300-style abs and limited English Rain has zero chemistry with Harris; indeed they spend half the movie apart. (Interminable flashbacks to his early training are like a ninja Hogwarts complete with magical powers and puppy love.) A triple-cross plot with Harriss superiors doesnt help the movies clarity--neither does the clattering sound design. Shouldnt throwing stars be silent? If theyre gonna sound like gunshots why not just use guns?

Media San Francisco Chronicle Ninja Assassin JAction. Starring Naomie Harris and Rain. Directed by James McTeigue. (R. 99 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) On the long list of things the world doesnt need any more of - bank failures global warming and a handsome teenager who turns into Frankenstein in the next ""Twilight"" movie - we need to add Bad Movies With the Word ""Ninja"" in the Title. There has never been a good one and the streak continues with ""Ninja Assassin"" which hits the trifecta Its a gorefest a borefest and a snorefest. Its also a bizarre career move for director James McTeigue who directed one of the best movies of the decade (""V for Vendetta"") and now follows that up with one of the worst of the year. I assumed he must have written ""Ninja Assassin"" thinking that only someone misguided enough to write such nonsense could be persuaded to direct it. But no he chose it Yeah yeah a ninja who goes around killing everybody thats the ticket. Nobodys ever thought of that one before right? This ones bad even by ninja movie standards. Naomie Harris plays an Interpol researcher in Berlin who stumbles upon evidence suggesting that a ninja assassin ring is behind a series of recent assassinations. So she gets on the case just in time to be interrupted by a series of long long long flashbacks in which we see the training of a very special ninja named Raizo (the Korean actor Rain). ""Suffering exists because weakness exists"" his Zen master/assassin trainer tells him. By the way amazing dialogue You know things are going to be bad when in the movies first scene ninjas show up to kill a gang leader and he actually says ""You dont have to do this. Whatever theyre paying you Ill double it."" Imagine a pair of screenwriters actually wrote that either thinking they were coming up with something original - in which case theyre stupid - or not caring that this line is from 10000 other movies - in which case they have contempt for their work or their audience or both. Anyway soon enough our Ninja Assassin goes rogue and hooks up with the Interpol researcher to defeat the ninja gang meaning that for a good long while were treated to scenes in which young Raizo has to kill 25 to 30 ninjas at the same time. McTeigue must know that his script is weak so he lavishes time on the fight scenes ... and renders them excruciatingly tiresome. Just one example Raizo is about to get into a car with the researcher and drive off but wait Two dozen ninjas show up. Of course we know that Raizo cant get killed so to stretch that fight sequence to 15 minutes is just an agony of delay. Its not action but the opposite of action. The movie is standing still while the camera shakes and the sound of butcher knives going into meat is played again and again over the soundtrack. Lots of meat-slicing sounds in ""Ninja Assassin"" by the way as well as liquid dripping sounds meant to indicate blood. Its hard to know how this movie constitutes entertainment even bad entertainment. Multiple heads arms and legs are sliced off ... I just never knew disgusting could be so dull. -- Advisory Nonstop butchery. Ninja Assassin JAction. Starring Naomie Harris and Rain. Directed by James McTeigue. (R. 99 minutes.

At major theatres. 18A Article Continued BelowThe shadowy world of Japans deadly ninja gets extra-shadowy in the latest outing by the team behind The Matrix. In fact moviegoers may find themselves straining to discern whats actually going on in Ninja Assassins action sequences which are often as dimly lit as they are hyper-accelerated.Very occasionally the decision to keep so much of the action under a cloak of darkness pays off such as when one frenzied battle is intermittently revealed via another characters flashlight. But thanks to the movies dire script flat performances and excessively slick tricked-out fight scenes it gets increasingly hard to care about anything that goes on here even when it happens to be visible without the use of night-vision goggles. Ninja Assassin is particularly disappointing given the pedigree of its creators - it was produced by Andy and Larry Wachowski makers of The Matrix trilogy and directed by James McTeigue who teamed with the brothers on V for Vendetta. Its also worth noting that it is one of the very few Hollywood features to be headlined by an Asian actor.The Korean pop star known as Rain stars as Raizo an orphan who is trained to be a killer by a centuries-old Japanese ninja clan. Though he is the most promising student of the clans gravel-voiced master Ozunu (Sho Kosugi veteran of many choice ninja movies of the 80s) Raizo eventually rebels because he is too sensitive to fully embrace the ruthless code of the ninja.When a police investigator played by 28 Days Laters Naomie Harris gets too close to the truth about the ninja clans Raizo comes to her aid. He does so principally by slicing former schoolmates to pieces with his weapon of choice a long steel chain with a blade on the end. You might expect that devotees of martial-arts cinema would be satisfied by the noisy frenetic and ultra-violent proceedings. But McTeigue and the Wachowskis betray the code of the ninja movie by overloading the action scenes with an excess of CGI such that a shower of digitized arterial spray rains down on nearly everyone on display. Rendered almost entirely in tones of red and black the sequences are made even more incomprehensible by editing so ridiculously over-aggressive it could give Michael Bay a headache. Movies as diverse as Kill Bill Vol. 1 and Kung Fu Panda show how well western filmmakers can now emulate the martial-arts movie traditions of their eastern counterparts. Meanwhile in Japan directors like Ryuhei Kitamura and Yoichi Sai have extended the parameters of the ninja genre with great finesse and imagination. But neither quality can be found in Ninja Assassin - not that you could see them if they were.

Ninja Assassin is no Matrix Add to ... Stephen Cole The Globe and Mail Published Tuesday Nov. 24 2009 231PM EST Last updated Friday Dec. 04 2009 207AM EST Comments AA Country USA Language English Ninja Assassin Directed by James McTeigue Written by Matthew Sand and J. Michael Straczynski Starring Rain Naomie Harris Ben Miles Rick Yune and Sho Kosugi Classification 18A The Matrix was famous for introducing the bullet cam. Time slowed. Characters moved as if struggling under water. Then the slowly rotating bullets came chasing down intended receivers. The special effect became so popular that before long all action movies were equipped with National Football League-style slow-motion playlets. The big deal in Ninja Assassin is deadly swooshing five-point stars. They travel much faster than Matrix bullets and when these sheriff-badge thingies connect look out Grown men are reassembled into haphazard columns of hamburger meat. Assassin blades are the ultimate silent weapon. So you might figure a ninja gang knocking off a pair of victims shouldnt take more than five minutes. Youd be wrong. Thats because one victim Raizo (Korean pop star Rain) is so nimble that he doesnt need an umbrella in a thunderstorm. Raizo gained his skills the hard way. As a child he was kidnapped by a secret society of ninja assassins - the Ozunu clan. Eventually he ran away swearing revenge against the depraved Lord Ozunu who had his sweetheart killed. Years later in Berlin he gets his chance befriending a gorgeous Interpol agent Mika (Naomie Harris). Mika has discovered that Ozunu ninjas are behind a wave of political assassinations. Now theyre coming for her. Will Raizo lose another woman to the Ozunu clan? Ninja Assassin is a convincing reasonably co-ordinated action movie. Nothing special but lovers of the genre will enjoy the workouts especially if they bring night-vision glasses. On the plus side Harris is an intriguing damsel in distress. And our action hero moves well although hes more Mist than Rain when delivering dialogue. Still the question arises Why is the film getting the VIP treatment opening on the eve of the American Thanksgiving weekend? The answer lies in Ninja Assassin s credits. The film is produced by Andy and Larry Wachowski creators of the Matrix trilogy (1999-2003) a 1.6-billion (U.S.) global franchise. Warner Bros. is hoping that a devoted fan base will want to know what the oppressive Lord Ozunu (Sho Kosugi) has to do with the calculating schemers who 10 years ago now attempted to domesticate the world with a virtual-reality matrix. All of the Wachowski films even Bound and V for Vendetta  are concerned with oppression and rebellion. Is Ninja Assassin an elaboration on the brothers most pressing theme? The answer is yes of course and not really. On one hand the film which is directed by James McTeigue who also did V for Vendetta  is all about the battered victims rising up against their oppressors. And for those who have been following Larry Wachowskis stormy voyage (Rolling Stone magazine has reported that he has taken up with L.A.s most infamous dominatrix) the film offers grist for the tabloid mill. Ninja Assassin takes an unhealthy interest in the swooning of battered victims especially in the ninja training camp where little kids are twisted and torn for their own good. ""Cut him failure must be sewn in blood"" is one of Lord Ozunus frequently hissed commands. On the other hand Ninja Assassin lacks the finesse and epic scope of The Matrix  an action film with an overheated brain - a scavenger hunt for religious and cultural references from the Bible to spaghetti westerns that made the eventual trilogy the sci-fi series of choice for Generation Special F/X. This one is simply a diverting uncommonly violent action flick. No need for an extended critical postmortem. Except to say the Wachowski brothers trademark seems to have turned into a designer brand dedicated to producing inexpensive knockoffs.

(Granted this is unlikely but just roll with me here.) At some point in your training a moral dilemma convinces you that you really dont want to be an elite killing machine. Movie Information Ninja AssassinRatingShowtimes | Official site | TrailerDirector James McTeigueActorsRain Naomie Harris Sho Kusugi and Sung KangRun time 99 minutesMPAA rating R (graphic violence language)SynopsisSpeed Racers Rain plays a ninja assassin.More movies from GuideLive.comWhats a recovering ninja assassin to do? Why paint the screen bright red of course. Splatter it on. Were talking streaks and rivers of blood - bloody swords bloody clothes and my personal favorite bloody stumps. Thats the M.O. of Ninja Assassin Make em bleed then make em bleed some more until laughter is the only sane response.The tone is set right from the start as a band of cocksure yakuza strut preen and wave their weapons around their shadowy hide-out. Suddenly theyre getting picked off one by one by an invisible foe (director James McTeigue delights in implying the ninjas stealthy advance) and the screen is streaked with painterly digital dashes of rouge. Game on.Soon were getting flashbacks to the assassin training ground where the noble Raizo (played by Rain no last name apparently needed) got his Darwinian survival-of-the-fittest-ninja training. Overseen by a ruthless father figure-overlord (Sho Kusugi) the lair should fuel enough Wu-Tang Clan samples to make the RZA happy for life. But Raizo balks when ordered to slay a ninja lass who has gone against the program. Several cliches about honor and duty later hes on the lam and working on his abs in private. Seriously dude has a 12-pack.Ninja Assassin is on firm enough ground with this kind of stuff; pulpy self-seriousness serves it very well. Alas it doesnt know how to leave well enough alone. Thus we also get an aboveground subplot involving Raizo and a gorgeous Europol agent (Naomie Harris) investigating ninja activity. Their chemistry is nil which is fine because the filmmakers have no interest in introducing an actual romance especially not between an Asian man and a black woman. This is after all still Hollywood.The film was produced by (among others) the Wachowski brothers who also teamed with McTeigue on V for Vendetta and of course spawned the Matrix series. This helps explain the fetishistic attention to visual detail and special effects on display in the action sequences which thankfully take up most of the running time. Its safe to say no one goes to a movie called Ninja Assassin for the story or dialogue.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + The credits for ""Ninja Assassin list two screenwriters and one director. But its fair to say the movie has come straight out of a box. Cobbled together from the instructions of assorted Hong Kong gangster bloodbaths and whatever the French superproducer Luc Besson did last this long thanklessly repetitive slice-kick-and-shoot-em-up has nothing to offer but the aggravating awareness that Jet Li and Jason Statham have done it better.""Ninja Assassin presents the young martial artist Rain. He has one name one facial expression and many ways to dodge a bullet. With a modicum of charisma Rain plays Raizo a top assassin who finds himself working against the ninja sect that trained him as a boy. As a man Raizo is stealthy and taciturn spending most of the movie headed toward various confusingly assembled digitally enhanced showdowns set in such inevitable locations as empty warehouses and anonymous office buildings.His partner for most of these chases is a Europol researcher in Berlin (Naomie Harris) who has just figured out that the ninjas are hired killers (for 100 pounds of gold theyre yours). Now she and Raizo are both wanted - namely by his head-ninja father (the esteemed martial artist Sho Kosugi). The movie doles out flashbacks to young Raizos ninja conscription (if you squint a terrorist-recruitment angle materializes) and the traumatizing disappearance of the fellow ninja he loves.Whenever the ninjas descend on Raizo the soundtrack fills with jazzily hissed words ""traitor ""vengeance ""kill ""bring him to father. Its like Bob Fosse night at the martial-arts studio. Most of the killing here is done with bladed throwing stars that like the ninjas themselves arrive from nowhere. They appear to have been used to edit the film as well.""Ninja Assassin was directed by a protege of the Wachowski brothers James McTeigue who made the similarly incoherent ""V for Vendetta. This new movie is also driven by mayhem. But unlike ""Vendetta the source isnt a graphic novel. Its the filmmakers incompetence. ""Ninja Assassin showcases a half-comical half-appalling indifference to common sense. At some point a medic shows up and examines someone with a gunshot wound. He doesnt bat an eyelash at the gentleman who looks like he just finished the ""Passion of the Christ workout.The whole film culminates in a long wasteful session of shooting and slashing between the police and the ninjas. It may be the first grisly action sequence to be objectionable solely on the grounds that its boring.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Michael Straczynski; Release Date Wide 11/25/2009; Runtime (in minutes) 96; MPAA Rating R Posted November 24 2009 -- 1200 AM EST The folks at the MPAA must have been snoozing when Ninja Assassin came up for its rating. Because this slick slice of martial-arts mayhem from the producers of The Matrix is awash in blood. It spurts and sprays in geysers. And it never lets up. Theres a brutal (and admittedly very cool) fight scene every five minutes. What story there is revolves around a ninja (Korean pop star Rain) who teams with a sassy Europol agent (Naomie Harris) to get payback on the clan who trained him to be a heartless assassin. But lets be honest killing is this films business...and business is good.

Ninja hear the one about the assassin named Raizo played by the Korean pop star and budding actor called Rain? In ""Ninja Assassin"" which is numbingly gory when it isnt just plain numbing this fellow rains down on his interchangeable adversaries like his own name. The script is pretty damp too. A deadly (duh) sect of super-secret ninjas (duh) known as the Ozunu Clan stake a claim to the ownership of Raizo trained from abusive childhood onward to become the most lethal of all the clan members. But he doesnt like the way they killed his sweetheart so he bolts goes undercover and eventually joins the Europol agent (Naomie Harris from ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" No. II and III) whos stationed in Berlin and hot on the trail of several unsolved murders that seem like total ninja assassin handiwork. No one expects much from a film like this except R-rated bloodletting with some excitement to it. But director James McTeigue who plodded his way through ""V for Vendetta"" has yet to show much facility for shaping action on-screen. McTeigue served as assistant director on all three ""Matrix"" films as well as ""Speed Racer"" and here (according to press materials) the creative team was jazzed about the prospect of something different something without a surfeit of wire work or digital fussing. The fight sequences rely on performers versed in the specialties of parkour (free running) and old-school Jackie Chan-y stunt wizardry. And all thats a secret to the audience. The opening ninja attack is so insanely gory with so many vivisections and severed limbs a-ploppin you barely notice the people doing the stunts. Most of the violence in the rest of ""Ninja Assassin"" remains in the dark so that what we see in bright light in the Big Opening is ""implied"" elsewhere. But McTeigue can barely shoot straight and the editing is so hack-y you have to take the stunts and fight choreography on faith. Hows Rain? Hes fine. He suffers prettily. Harris is the best reason to keep watching and although its a tiny step forward to have the female lead in a film like this not treated like a piece of meat the slaughter parade isnt much fun. According to the MPAA the movies R rating (which probably couldve/shouldve been an NC-17) is for ""strong bloody stylized violence throughout."" Oh its stylized I see. Thats OK then. The target audiences for ""Ninja Assassin"" have already spent weeks of their lives vivisecting bad guys on one gaming system or another most of them without turning into sadistic killers in real life. So thats a comfort even if ""Ninja Assassins"" isnt a good movie.

Ninja Assassin Bad Director James McTeigue. Cast Rain Naomie Harris Ben Miles. Rating Rated R for strong bloody stylized violence throughout and language. RELATED Rain hopes for a shower of Ninja stardom Martial arts movies Plenty of great kung fu movies. And not just the artsy ones like ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" and ""House of Flying Daggers."" There are straight-ahead epic showdowns (""Iron Monkey"" is a favorite) and such awesome spoofs as ""Kung Fu Hustle"" and ""Drunken Master."" Ninja movies not so much. Sure there are good flicks with ninjas in them but most of them have ""samurai"" in the title. ""Ninja Assassin"" directed by ""V for Vendettas"" James McTeigue and starring the Korean pop singer Rain updates this martial-arts subgenre to post-""300"" levels of comic-book excess. They might have called it ""House of Flying Extremities"" but ""Ninja Assassin"" as unimaginatively literal as it is at least amounts to truth in advertising. This movie may be filled with razor-sharp shuriken and katanas but as far as the filmmaking goes its a blunt instrument. McTeigue sets the tone early with a bloodbath in a yakuza hideout. As the macho young gangsters blast away at shadows a flurry of blurred steel severs arms and legs. Most spectacular is a decapitation at the jawline. The story such as it is pits ninja outcast Raizo (Rain) against his former clan. Eventually he teams up with Mika (Naomie Harris) a pretty young investigator for ""Europol"" whos hot on the paper trail of a 2000-year-old assassination service. In the meantime we are treated to flashbacks of Raizos upbringing by his ruthless clan leader Ozunu (Sho Kosugi) a sort of evil-universe version of Master Po on ""Kung Fu."" There is a teenage love interest who is killed of course but not before setting Raizo on the path toward good. ""Trees dont have hearts"" he says. ""Everything has a heart"" she assures him. ""I dont."" ""Really?"" Cue the music. At which point you might be muttering ""Spare us the drama and move on to the next dismemberment"" - a request that this movie is happy to oblige with an endless parade of action sequences with ninja stars flying like automatic-weapons fire (not to mention plenty of actual automatic-weapons fire). Most of the action is shot close-up in dim lighting so you rarely get to slow down and appreciate the individual bits of choreography - hey did he just chop that guy in half? Of course this is perfectly in keeping with the ninjas strike-from-shadows tactics although one wonders why such stealthy fellows advertise their presence with a chorus of sinister whispering as if they were in a scene from ""Lost."" There are a few half-hearted attempts at Tarantino-esque filmic irony although they are as hamfisted as the rest of the directing (as when a shot of a washing machine leaking quarts of blood cuts to a shot of ketchup spattering onto french fries). No doubt the fast-flying weaponry and the ticking body count will please fans of other stylized gorefests such as ""300"" but for the rest of us ""Ninja Assassin"" is a big bloody bore.

"Ninja Assassin | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Review Ninja Assassin Rob Nelson 0 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr October 21 2009 | 0530PM PT Thinly plotted this young ninjas revenge will disappoint those not delighted by ultraviolence. Seemingly made to capitalize on a dubious CG innovation -- namely the slicing of bodies in half by whizzing five-pointed stars -- ""Ninja Assassin"" has little else to recommend it not even laughs. Working again with the Wachowski brothers as producers director James McTeigue delivers a lower-brow somewhat livelier work than the teams ""V for Vendetta."" But unless the viewer is easily delighted by ultraviolence for its own sake this thinly plotted movie about a young ninjas revenge against his cruel trainers will disappoint. Warner Bros. Nov. 25 release should nonetheless prove effective as holiday-season counterprogramming at least in the short term. Korean pop star Rain conjures only a mild drizzle as Raizo a limber bone-snapper trained from a young age by a secret society of child-abducting killer-for-hire ninjas. Early flashbacks reveal Raizo to have been taken in as an orphan by the Ozunu Clan which he defies by running away in the wake of his sweethearts murder by cold-blooded Lord Ozunu (Sho Kosugi). The pics present-day action set in Berlin revolves around Mika Coretti (Naomie Harris) a gorgeous Europol agent whose latenight sleuthing uncovers a financial connection between recent political assassinations and the Ozunu. Naturally the agent herself is targeted for assassination as chief Ozunu baddie Takeshi (Rick Yune) and his blade-tossing ninja comrades come West to forcibly halt the investigation. As if possessed of psychic powers Raizo hiding out in Europe senses a chance to save a lovely lady where he had failed in the same task years before. Eventually the film leads to a Europol-led shootout and a pair of unmemorably acrobatic duels between Raizo and his two archrivals -- ""older brother"" Takeshi and raspy-voiced ""father"" Ozunu. Though ""Ninja Assassin"" is implausible on countless levels Raizos training to feel nothing at least gels with Rains ability to emote nothing. Harris a strong presence in Michael Manns ""Miami Vice"" feature acquits herself capably here reacting believably to the incessant carnage around her. Of course the films raison detre is precisely its blood-soaked combination of physical stunts and digital trickery the latter favored to a fault. While not remotely on par with the Wachowskis ""bullet time"" f/x in ""The Matrix"" the ridiculous torrent of flying blades and flayed flesh here does appear unique in technological terms and certainly pushes the pics R rating to its limits. Indeed such is the films level of insinuated gore that the frustratingly dark texture of many fight-scene shots can perhaps be explained by a post-production bid to avoid an NC-17. Whatever the case the shadowy action is too often incomprehensible except in the general sense that heads limbs and torsos are being severed in massive numbers. If theres a sick joke to be had from this sort of human meat-carving it isnt found by McTeigue and his key collaborators including conventionally quick-cutting editors Gian Ganziano and Joseph Jett Sally. Where the pic does excel is in its immersive sound design as swords chains and myriad other weapons seem to sail around the theater at times helping to clarify the dimly lit action.
