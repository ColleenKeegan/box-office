A resurrection parable that has all the integrity of a grave robber this frustrating bit of pulp is actually worse than the punctuation of its title might suggest (especially since Face/Off and Crazy/Beautiful gave the forward slash such a good name). Damian (Ben Kingsley doing his best Donald Trump impression) is a maliciously greedy real estate mogul whos built half of Manhattan. His empire metastasizes across the city skyline as aggressively as the cancer chewing its way through his body--even the worlds richest men are mortal. But that can be hard for them to accept so Damian doesnt seem quite as surprised as most of us would be when a dashing young stranger named Albright (Matthew Goode) introduces him to the idea of ""shedding"" an experimental procedure in which a patients consciousness is magnetically transferred into a hunkier vessel. And so just minutes after the film begins Kingsley is swapped out for a confused (and horny) Ryan Reynolds. The films fragile premise hinges on Reynoldss ability to connect Damian 2.0 to the person he used to be but his snarky and suddenly compassionate version of the character doesnt make him feel like a man reborn so much as a man rewritten. Its a fatal flaw that unmoors any intrigue in Damians quest to uncover the insidious truth about Albright and learn the real cost of shedding (hint the poor have to suffer for the rich to survive). Singh an aesthete whose signature visual opulence graced Mirror Mirror and The Fall with a veneer of imagination feels as lost as his protagonist An expertly staged shoot-out in the second act only serves to articulate the films unrealized potential. Tedious and predictable Self/less is also far too long and that might be the most damning problem for viewers who only have one life to live.

NATHAN RABIN Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jul. 10 2015 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Jul. 10 2015 1200AM EDT Comments AA Directed by Tarsem Singh Written by David Pastor Alex Pastor Starring Ryan Reynolds Ben Kingsley Matthew Goode Year 2015 Country USA Language English Tarsem Singh has a reputation for making movies that are visually stunning but woefully inert and convoluted in their storytelling (see The Cell and The Fall). Singhs most recent film Self/less lives up to at least half of that reputation.Sure enough the narrative is schlocky and groaningly over-familiar but the film is also uncharacteristically drab visually with a washed-out colour palette and anemic pacing. The fourth film in the Mad Max franchise starring Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron lands in theatres on May 15. Movie Preview Summer movie preview From Fantastic Four to Poltergeist 19 flicks coming your way The only sequence where Singhs gifts for blending sound with image come to the fore is a stand-out montage sequence where the films elderly protagonist enjoys his new younger body by having sex with a score of interchangeable young sexpots in a hypnotic sequence that moves to the propulsive electric rhythms of black New Orleans kids beating on homemade drums in the scorching heat. The sequence stands out in part because it uses the films setting smartly if shamelessly but also because the rest of the films imagery is so thoroughly unimaginative.In a performance no one will remember him for Ben Kingsley stars as Damian the aforementioned old man a mogul so insanely rich that his apartment appears to be a giant gold bullion cube. Damians wealth can buy him everything but health and youth and in a crazy twist it turns out that it can buy him that as well. The dying multimillionaire discovers that there is a sinister and mysterious company that specializes in a process called ""shedding"" that allows masters of the universe such as himself to trade in their decrepit aged and sick bodies for shiny models that appear to be brand new.Sure enough Damian signs on at the cost of a not-so-small fortune and finds himself upgraded into a well-muscled 35-year-old body that now allows him to be played by Ryan Reynolds. The now-young Damian briefly enjoys the advantages of being young and sexy but hes haunted by flashbacks and hallucinations that pull him and the film into a deeply uninteresting and hopelessly cliched direction.In its early going Self/less at least has the audacity and ambition to follow in the footsteps of Seconds John Frankenheimers trippy gorgeous and visually daring 1966 character study about a sad old man who undergoes a process similar to the one Damian experiences and wakes up looking like Rock Hudson. But the film seems perversely uninterested in its promising premise and runs away from it at the first opportunity.Damian hasnt had much of an opportunity to enjoy the perks of looking like Ryan Reynolds before the film shifts frustratingly from an exploration of mortality and identity to one of those weirdly ubiquitous action-thrillers where a man who finds himself suddenly blessed with super-soldier skills must protect himself and a terrified woman from an ominous conspiracy out to stop them at all costs. Kingsleys performance is notable primarily for the bad Dustin Hoffman impersonation he seems to be doing with his New York accent. Reynolds has proven himself as an actor through the years most recently in his wonderfully insane committed turn in The Voices but he is convincing neither as a man with the brain of a rich old guy inside him or as an action hero.Singh has been hamstrung by weak scripts but Self/less is a stinker even by those standards. David and Alex Pastors screenplay is a compendium of hoary cliches that features multiple instances of characters looking on Wikipedia or Google as a way of clumsily conveying relevant information New Orleans as a lazily ""colourful"" backdrop and in an unintentional homage to action movie conventions a set-piece at an abandoned warehouse housing old Mardi Gras floats. If youre going to set a film in New Orleans why not make it the most stereotypically New Orleans movie imaginable?Self/lesss protagonist is also two disappointing under-realized and poorly conceived characters in one. Its understandable why Damian undergoes a dramatic shift as his personality and the instincts and personality of the body hes inherited increasingly overlap.Whats less understandable and less forgivable is why a director with as much personality as Singh made a movie this maddeningly generic.

Were told that the new body has been grown in a lab -- that it is essentially a blank slate. Of course that turns out not to be the case but for a few moments there I allowed myself to savor the possibility that Tarsem Singhs new film had sneaked in a sick subtle dig at Reynoldss bland lifeless persona. At any rate a movie that starts out with Ben Kingsley and winds up with Ryan Reynolds has its work cut out for it. That body -- which for a while makes the once-debilitated Damian Hale (the aforementioned millionaire) physically fit and irresistible to women -- turns out to have once belonged to a former soldier now presumed dead whose mind has been wiped clean. So Damian has effectively invaded this other mans corporeal being. Soon enough he starts seeing visions dreams -- images of a family and a home in the heartland. In other words theres somebody else here inside this head. And that somebody we learn has a wife and a daughter who are unaware of what happened to him. As Damian starts to investigate further the mysterious organization that arranged for his transplant -- a process called ""shedding"" -- starts to become proactive in trying to stop him. Explosions and gunfire ensue. To quote an old Buddhist proverb The body is just a vessel but dont steal another mans car dipshit. Self/Less at times bears a striking resemblance to John Frankenheimers 1966 masterpiece Seconds in which a man went through a similar procedure and woke up as Rock Hudson and while a part of me wants to condemn the film for daring to ape a classic in truth Self/Lesss main problem is that its not enough like Seconds. It promises us a psychological thriller about identity and the self. Damian learns that if he stops taking his meds eventually he will fade away and this other man will come back. Thats a haunting conundrum You have invaded another persons very being with the help of some rather evil people. What do you do with your self? Do you willingly fade away so the other man (and his family) can have his life back? Unfortunately Self/Less isnt interested in exploring that question. Because it eventually devolves into a series of action scenes and breakneck escapes and chases each lamer than the last. Even director Singh once the confident stylist behind movies like The Cell and The Fall seems to be conceding territory here His filmmaking is mostly clean but gone is his fascination with motion his willingness to let dumb action sequences slip into near-abstraction and become something else. No this time they remain dumb action sequences. Eventually you start to wonder if the movie forgot to take its own pills What starts out as an interesting exploration of identity soon gives way to the uninspired generic action flick we had feared it always was. One in which Ryan Reynolds keeps making you wish he were Ben Kingsley.

Alan Markfield/Gramercy Pictures hide caption toggle caption Alan Markfield/Gramercy Pictures Ryan Reynolds in Self/less. Alan Markfield/Gramercy Pictures Its a shame Ben Kingsley doesnt have more of a mustache in Tarsem Singhs new science fiction thriller Self/less. If he had one long enough to twirl menacingly if he was playing that kind of outsize stereotype at least hed be able to clarify exactly what sort of role hes meant to fulfill. The script certainly suggests his character Damian Hale is a sort of villain Hes a ruthless mega-rich industrialist who begins the film by staging a fancy lunch just to humiliate a younger businessman. Then he makes whats clearly the latest in a long series of attempts to buy the love of his estranged political-activist daughter. On paper hes not a nice guy Hes condescending and judgmental with only one meaningful friendship and an echoing void for a life. But Kingsley plays him with soulful regret and a warm weariness. And his sins such as they are are minor Hes more mildly unkind than actually ruthless. He could just as easily be a misunderstood man whos always wanted to do the right thing. Its never clear who Damian is meant to be at the outset or how the story sees him. Hes a gently benign shadow. Ambiguity in thrillers can be a rare and great thing The ideal for smart film fans is a movie that doesnt over-explain or try to hold the audiences hand with a sweaty anxious grip. But a story so subtle that it doesnt make a statement can undermine a film. And vagueness doesnt work at all in a film thats so clearly about a transformation arc. Some of the changes Damian goes through in Self/less are physical The films initial hook is that hes dying of cancer until a shadowy organization offers to move his mind and memories into a fresh new body for a mere 250 million. Damian is told his new body was grown for him in a vat but once hes actually running around as a young fit man (and being played by Ryan Reynolds) he starts having flashbacks to what appears to be the former life of his new body. Once he starts investigating he finds people who were badly hurt by choices he didnt know he was making. And then he starts taking actions that are -- cue knowing chuckling ""Oh right the title of the film"" moment -- profoundly selfless. Somewhere in this muddled chase-heavy curiously anonymous movie is the spine of a great story about that mustache-twirling villain type who realizes that with a great body comes great responsibilities. Or to be less flip its the story of someone who isnt satisfied with his life and finds to his surprise that he can start over not just superficially with young muscles and a young libido but in a larger more meaningful way. The film does occasionally point in this direction as he starts bonding with a young girl in the way he wishes hed bonded with his daughter. But because Damian himself starts as such a blank the big changes in his life barely register as a change. Mathematically an arc can be drawn with three points. Hes missing the first one the origin point. Who is he before he becomes something different? Cinematic science-fiction stories love big transformations especially ones that come quickly and go to extreme places. The entire genre is generally about what a major technological or conceptual change in the world would do to people to society or maybe just to an individual person. But getting to the hook in a science-fiction film fast enough to keep audiences involved often means rushing past the opening. Recently Ex Machina started in medias res with hapless protagonist Caleb introduced in the opening shot as he gets the message that will change his life. The film takes no time to establish who he is before he heads off on his journey to meet a reclusive genius and a newly established artificial intelligence. Mad Max Fury Road re-introduces the title character to a new generation in the middle of action as he flees and fights his would-be captors. For that matter it handles most of its other introductions the same way Imperator Furiosa doesnt get a series of quiet establishing conversations before she kicks off the first of many raging wild chase scenes. And looking back just a little further the kinetic tech-fantasy of 2014s Lucy also made a point of introducing its protagonist barely a couple of minutes before the action starts. As far as audiences are concerned her character is little more than a tight dress and a loud jacket before she becomes an unwilling drug mule and then when the drugs release inside her the next step in human evolution. All three of these protagonists (and many of the subsidiary characters around them) have arcs within their films They each face a crisis that requires redefining themselves. The difference is that their stories are all more about the aftermath than the lead-up. In all three of these movies characters are allowed to define themselves through action. Caleb reveals himself through his initially cautious patronizing conversation with the AI Ava. Max and Furiosa explain who they are through the battles they pick and the ways they choose to fight them. Lucy stops being a person early in her story and what she was becomes irrelevant as she transcends human thought and personality. In each case leaving their histories blank works as a choice because these characters are so extreme and specific going to such outlandish and personal ends to deal with their situations. In each case its suggested that their present situations make their histories. The present is what matters because their present redefines them. And that approach might have worked with Self/less if it werent so openly fundamentally about the radical changes Damian is going through. Conceptually everything in the film is about how he discarded one life in order to take up another. Everything he does in the present is in some way rooted in his struggle to escape his history. But everything thats so relevant and problematic for him everything hes struggling to let go of or transcend is ill-defined and glossed-over for the audience. Hes redefining who he is out of guilt that the viewers cant possibly share. It seems unlikely that a man ruthless enough to create such a vast financial empire at the cost of destroying his own family would concern himself as closely with strangers as Damian does over the course of the film. ""Why would he do any of this?"" is a more pressing question than ""How will he get away?"" -- which becomes a serious narrative problem for any story. None of which would matter if Damians present circumstances in Self/less on the run from his bodys past and devoting himself to saving other peoples lives seemed as unique and striking as the action in these other recent films. But the story bogs down in familiar chases and fights shot without any particular concept or point of view behind them. The only significant thing about Damian as a character is the relationships he builds during the film and those have to exist in a vacuum. He has accoutrements--an empire and an angry daughter an old business friend a peanut allergy--rather than an actual character. And thats regrettable because deep under the skin of this shrug of a movie is a solid metaphor rooted in an appealing fantasy. Self/less is already about several types of wish-fulfillment. Its about the dream of being rich powerful and functionally immortal. Its about the dream of starting over with the wisdom of age but with a young strong attractive body. Its about atoning for past mistakes and finding ways to revitalize broken relationships. Its just not about a relatable or even interesting character doing any of these things. Maybe it didnt need a mustache-twirling cartoon villain. But it needed something with that level of solidity and specificity. Some stories need to have a past in order to have a future.

"Hope/less? Another Failed Shot for Ryan Reynolds; Plus The Gallows Nightmare and Tangerine Dream << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Hope/less? Another Failed Shot for Ryan Reynolds; Plus The Gallows Nightmare and Tangerine Dream Focus Features Movies July 10 2015 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print For everything thats intangible about being a star there are some useful tools we can use to measure whether someone actually is one. Is this person the only one you can imagine in a particular part? And can this person turn a bad stupid or generic movie into a hit? This is just a way of wondering -- once more -- whether Ryan Reynolds will ever be the sort of actor who can lure audiences to something like Self/less while diverting your thoughts from the dozen or so other men and women who could have carried the same body-swap movie. The plot is almost two hours of empty calories built around Reynolds who runs around the middle of the country trying to solve an absurd mystery set into motion when a gravely ill bizarrely accented Manhattan real estate magnate named Damian Hale (Ben Kingsley) spends some of his fortune to move his soul into Reynoldss younger haler body. Meanwhile Damians cadaver will be returned for a funeral -- presumably so his management team and CNBC can pay lugubrious tribute. The company (called Phoenix because all the subtle names were taken) conducting the transfer assures old Damian that this new vessel was lab-raised. And given the fatlessness on display you just go with it. (Albright the young clammy-looking British scientist in charge at Phoenix is played by Matthew Goode who in a suit and glasses seems like hes starring in a different fake chiller Wes Cravens Princeton.) You look at the two fit bodies lying prone on the parallel retractable beds of the soul-transfer machine and notice that the new body doesnt look that new. Once Reynoldss version of Damian is up and about and given a new life and name (Edward) we discover that new Damian is about 35 and graying. We never see the older man participate in the process of engineering a second body. But the minor kick of the movie is that there wasnt one. Before Edward gets to the bottom of why its all fun. Hes set up in a New Orleans manse on the border of Faubourg Marigny and the French Quarter. A brass-and-percussion street band provides a seemingly personal soundtrack for the montage of women falling onto his bed in ecstasy. Old Damian had been sad about never connecting with his droopy adult daughter (Michelle Dockery an actress whose point continues to elude me). Shes rejected his sense of capitalism by running a drab-looking nonprofit which judging from the Costco decor hands out breakfast cereal in bulk. But for now never mind her Theres basketball to play women to seduce and Derek Lukes offer of friendship to accept. But somethings not right. Edward misses a dose of the red pills Phoenix gave him to cut down on side effects which include flashbacks to a life Old Damian never lived. Focus Features Theres no reason to spoil what follows except to say that even by the standards of both Alfred Hitchcock and science fiction its nonsensical. Edward goes to Missouri where an idyllic sci-fi/fantasy Hollywood farmscape awaits along with its owner Maddy a very confused single mother played with tearful intensity by Natalie Martinez (who unfortunately spends the movie relegated in function and attire to ""nanny"" even though the child shes looking after belongs to her character). The script is credited to the Spanish brothers Alex and David Pastor and the director is Tarsem Singh working a more flavorless angle than hes probably used to. Gone is the nutso visual maximalism of The Cell and Immortals and the layered self-amusement of Julia Roberts in Mirror Mirror. The closest to baroque that things get here is Old Damians gilded apartment with its Trumps-eye views of Central Park. Its as if a 24-karat dog pooped on all the surfaces. Singh is in charge of a safer more conventional movie where ""Were looking for an abandoned warehouse"" is an actual line of dialogue. I think the scientific ideas that Ex Machina expressed are embedded in sexual cliches but there are at least ideas to dismiss. For most of Self/less I was sure I was watching the first two episodes of a vapid new cable series. A late twist kicks the film into a moderately higher gear of wit but I spent the whole thing feeling bad for Reynolds who works hard to sell the movie as something other than a composite of everything from Jacobs Ladder and The Fugitive to the Bourne series and Limitless. Hes giving you most of what hes got. You just never sense that you couldnt have gotten the same performance from about eight other men which I imagine is how the role wound up with him. With these action movies and romantic comedies that often feels true of Reynolds Somebody else said no first. Whats fascinating is that hes peaking as a performer. He has lost the glibness and sarcasm that made his physique more of an asset than it probably should have been. In the spring he reached a new casually soulful place as Helen Mirrens reluctant attorney in Woman in Gold. Before that his emotional suppression was the best thing in Atom Egoyans truly embarrassing The Captive. And hes just as good as a seemingly wholesome gambler in Mississippi Grind a casino drama with Ben Mendelsohn that comes out later this year. Reynolds cant do gonzo the way Jake Gyllenhaal thinks he can and Bradley Cooper is now much smoother and more confident in any part he gets. He might never get roles that are going to the Christian Bales and Leonardo DiCaprios of the world. He might actually be better as a second banana the way he is with Mirren and Mendelsohn. In the meantime he can drag slick-enough action movies like this new one over the finish line. But hopefully Reynolds has at least forgotten the title. Its not less self he needs but more.  Warner Bros. Another month another ultimately inadequate found-footage horror movie -- and from the Blumhouse cannery too. But The Gallows has a cleverness that bobs occasionally above the surface of cesspool murk. You cant tell whether its just flotsam or a corpse but for most of the 80-minute run time it almost doesnt matter. Its at least something. The setting is a Nebraska high school production of a play (The Gallows) that according to camcorder footage from 1993 appears to be some kind of puritanical trial drama whose climax is the lynching of the male lead. You can hear the parents of that actor expressing expository marvel at how good he is. But then he steps onto the scaffold and is hanged for real. Decades later the school is restaging the play presumably to complete business that went unfinished. The footage here this time made public by the local police department mostly belongs to the smartphone of a bullying football player named Ryan (Ryan Shoos) who decides to recruit the star of the show and his former teammate Reese (Reese Mishler) to destroy the set because theater is for pussies. Ryans feisty cheerleader girlfriend Cassidy (Cassidy Gifford daughter of Kathie Lee and Frank) invites herself along and eventually the plays earnest female lead Pfeifer (Pfeifer Brown) turns up too. Theyre all bait for whatever is trying to slip that rope around their necks. The Gallows betters its predecessors by adding a metaphysical presence that conforms to the bogeymen of old -- here its somebody in a leather hood waving a noose. With any of these movies the question for me is always how people manage to hold on to cameras when theyre running crawling or crying for their life. Its a formal crutch that never quite breaks through illogic to get to something like ""societal metaphor."" It just makes the filmmakers -- Travis Cluff and Chris Lofing who wrote and coproduced too -- and the credited director of photography (Edd Lukas) seem desperate. Its also impossible to keep track of the jumps in footage when say someones battery dies. The video leaps fitfully from device to device like a disease in search of a host. And has the police department also performed sleight-of-hand edits and provided the footage its banging whirring slamming wholly insinuating sound design? Theres also the loaded hassle of watching a movie have fun with a symbol of racial threat. The noose persists on campuses and outside homes and churches to terrorize and intimidate. The near-comprehensive whiteness of these Blumhouse movies -- the most recent widget was the partially fascinating Skype-mare slasher film Unfriended from the spring -- poses no problem from film to film. But here you do wonder how a change in the casting strategy might have also altered the nature of the threat. What would adding a black character to this movie in particular have done to reshape the meaning of the bogeyman? The lack of any credible explanation of why whats happening is happening fertilizes an inclination to speculate. No one in the racially mixed audience I saw this with the other night seemed to be doing much speculation. They just went with it -- well as far as something this violently incoherent could take them. There was jumping shrieking and shouting advice at the screen. This is a movie made for the ""dont go in there""-minded. People want the visceral punch not of good horror per se but of any horror. But sometimes with these footage films the bridge to get to horror is laughably rickety. At some point in The Gallows the characters stumble upon a warping video that reexplains the events of 1993 complete with spliced-in news coverage. Found footage is one thing. But youre in trouble when the footage has to find you.  Cre Film In theory The Gallows was shot with phones. But Sean Bakers gangbusters farce Tangerine actually was -- with an iPhone. And that is the least of its many vertiginous selling points.  In part its the story of a Los Angeles transgender prostitute named Sin-Dee Rella (Kitana Kiki Rodriguez) just out of jail and on a mission to find the non-transgender white woman who slept with Sin-Dees man and her best friend Alexandra (Mya Taylor) who attempts to serve as a one-woman bomb squad. In part its the story of an Armenian cab driver named Razmik (Karren Karagulian) cruising the streets for fares. In part its the story of how they all happen to descend upon the same grubby doughnut shop one Christmas Eve night. I wrote about this movie in January from Sundance. Ive seen it again since then and could watch it every week until Bakers next scuzzy acrobatic magnum opus. He has an affection for the urban underbelly and a way with personality- and reaction-based comedy thats hard to do. The indignities insults and vulgarities pile up until they feel monumental. The races ethnicities genders and sexualities all pinball off each other until it starts to feel almost musical. The only thing that Rodriguez and Taylor a pair of amateurs dont do is burst entirely into song and they could. Theyre stars -- to themselves and therefore to us. By the films shockingly poignant final sequence theyve also become actresses. Theres a bit of Scorseses After Hours here at least in some of its surrealism though Bakers doing more celebrating than he is ironizing and decrying -- but not in a fashion-photographer party-planning-anthropologist sort of way. The film never loses sight of the risks and dangers and general ugliness of its colliding worlds. One bonkers motel sequence has a fundamental sadness that cant be upstaged by comedy. That the tone shifts there without costing Baker the movie indicates how soundly were in the hands of a confident humane artist. Hes not fetishizing or spotlight-shining. These people are the way they are the movie says. This obscenely vibrant patch of L.A. is officially an enclave. But Baker makes it feel bigger and louder and crazier than that. He turns subculture into family.

A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Imagine Donald Trump wanted to reboot his disastrous presidential campaign announcement month to start over as a younger man with real hair. In Tarsem Singhs Self/less Trump could hire the medical geniuses of Phoenix Biogenic to transfer his aging brain into a strapping hot bod for 250 million -- the price of lab-grown ""genetically engineered perfection"" purrs founder Dr. Albright (Matthew Goode). Scarier still Trumps 4 billion fortune could afford him 15 more chances to fuck up if his new golem kept saying racist things.Here our monstrous real estate mogul is Damian Hale (Ben Kingsley) a tycoon so obsessed with ostentatious wealth that his Central Park penthouse has gold-plated martini shakers. Damian is dying of cancer. Like a Victorian heroine hes continually coughing up sticky red blood. Though in a nod to the 21st century instead of hacking his guts onto a kerchief he splutters onto a laptop.Film Details Selfless (Self/less) RatingPG-13 GenreSciFi/Fantasy Running Time116 min. More Info Kingsley plays Damian as straight-backed and cruel as a spike. In his first scene he destroys a 20-somethings career over an insult. To score a lucrative contract the kid told a councilman that ""the old man wont be around for long."" Its true -- and Damian knows it -- but he still wants vengeance he wont even be alive to enjoy. Unless that is that crackpot company Phoenix really can transplant his consciousness into a healthy human. It works and after a fake fatal accident in front of his unsuspecting best friend Martin (Victor Garber) Damian sticks his head into a spinning metal donut and wakes up in the body of Ryan Reynolds. The first thing he does is vomit. Soothes Albright ""Death has some side effects.""Kingsley is such a good actor that he practically sabotages the film. Before exiting 15 minutes in he infuses Damian with gravitas empathy intelligence mercilessness and ambition. Damian 2.0 is just a nice dude who cant wait to get laid. Reynolds has done body-swap movies before -- he was excellent channeling Jason Bateman in the underappreciated comedy The Change-Up -- but Singh seems to have forgotten to tell him what to mimic. (I wouldnt be shocked to hear they shot Reynolds scenes first.) Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat. Sep. 10 1200pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On the CW Tickets Sat.

Sep. 13 600pm Instead Self/less leans on the natural empathy of Reynolds who might have the most visible conscience in cinema. When you look at him you see an insecure kid worried about being nice. Hes also well cast to play an old man embedded in a hunk. In most of his films Reynolds wears his own body as a joke. Hes built like a beast whos regularly required to wear superhero tights but from the neck up hes an ordinary guy with a thin-lipped almost nervous smile at his own bowling-ball musculature. The contrast almost always works to his advantage -- if you see Self/less and walk away declaring Reynolds cant act watch him play a sweetheart serial killer in this years The Voices -- and could have here if Singh had given him anything more to do than run and jump. Reynolds doesnt even copy Kingsleys ramrod posture. Instead he gets a few scenes of puppyish physical exaltation quietly showing us how happy Damian is to play sports and jog and screw and a few decent gags as his inner geezer tries to act cool. In the back of a cab snogging a hottie he pretends to be hip to a tacky pop song and the girl immediately calls him out with a giggle.If this were the movie itd be a pointless but pleasant diversion. Were steeling ourselves for awkward nonsense -- say hot Damian accidentally making his own daughter (Michelle Dockery) an estranged environmental activist fall in lust with him. But then brothers Alex and David Pastors script tries to get smart and winds up getting really really dumb. Damian realizes his new life came at a human cost and Self/less pretends that a billionaire Scrooge whos already abandoned his own family would risk everything to save a strangers. And dumber still that a ruthless well-connected genius can think of no better revenge than grabbing a gun.Singhs films -- The Cell The Fall -- have always been more dumb than they looked. But thats because they looked brilliant. Hes a raving stylist a maverick willing to say end his rococo Snow White movie Mirror Mirror with a Bollywood dance number. Yet Self/less is so restrained that I wonder if somebody stole Singhs body too. The neat plastic igloos in the Phoenix labs have the crafty low-budget-looking design of a promising first-time filmmaker not of a visual loon who started his career wrapping Jennifer Lopez in latex and shoving her inside a screensaver.Self/less only flourish is an editing pace that clips ahead into the next scene before the current one is done as if Singhs impatient to get the whole thing over with. (Though theres one great montage where he turns the sounds of New Orleans into a living pulse.) Its odd to see him slum it with a generic action script and odder still to see that this CGI whiz can pull off an excellent tactile car chase that reminds us that speeding SUVs are clumsy heavy and chaotic. His film is good with physics and lousy at philosophy.As the goon body count rises in Damians pursuit of justice you could argue he was a better man in his lavish mansion before his social awakening. At least then he agreed that a human life cost a quarter of a billion dollars. The stack of corpses he creates are worthless.SELF/LESS | Directed by Tarsem Singh | Written by David Pastor and Alex Pastor | Gramercy Pictures | Citywide Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

"Self/Less | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; self-less ) Self/Less (United States 2015) July 09 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli Self/less begins with a promising (albeit well-worn) science fiction premise degrades it by turning it into a generic thriller and finishes it off with a rushed disjointed ending. The film from director Tarsem Singh (whose most recent credit was the Snow White-inspired Mirror Mirror) is instructive in illustrating the cavalier and unsatisfying way Hollywood often takes intriguing ideas and debases them by forcing them into familiar narrative structures. Theres enough material in Self/less to fuel a mini-series. Instead of letting the story breathe the film rushes along at breakneck speed using contrivances and ""shortcuts"" in failed attempts at character development. The film opens with Ben Kingsley (in full Ming the Merciless mode) playing a wealthy New York City powerbroker who is afflicted with an aggressive form of cancer. Eager to avoid the embrace of the Grim Reaper he accepts the offer of geneticist Professor Albright (Matthew Goode) who claims he can transplant the content of Damians mind into a younger healthy body (Ryan Reynolds). Once the transition is complete Damian discovers all is not smooth sailing. Not only is the new body trying to reject the implanted thoughts and memories but the identity of its previous inhabitant is in danger of re-emerging. Indeed prodded by visions Damian searches out his former ""wife"" (Natalie Martinez) and ""daughter"" putting their lives in danger when Albright realizes Damian might be less loyal than he expected. The central moral dilemma is absorbing. What would a person do to achieve immortality or at least to extend his life by another 50 years? Would he collaborate in the annihilation of anothers identity? Unfortunately Self/less becomes so focused on the chase scenes and fights that it loses sight of any larger picture. In the end the screenplay cops out with an unearned resolution that is neither sensible nor consistent. This ""exist strategy"" betrays the few fascinating elements not previously ground underfoot by a ponderous improbable story. Perhaps the biggest inconsistency in Self/less relates to the character of Damian. The conceit is that although he changes bodies hes the same person regardless of whether hes being played by Ben Kingsley or Ryan Reynolds. But the filmmakers are unable to convince us that Kingsleys Damian is Reynolds Damian. Its not just that they dont look alike but they dont act the same way. The cold ruthlessness that defines old Damian is lost in the transition and were presented with a completely different person. The movie attempts to humanize Damian by introducing the family of the former occupant of his body. This creates all sorts of complications none of which are dramatized effectively. The relationships that develop during a short road trip are cemented with undue haste capped off by an egregiously manipulative scene of Damian giving swimming lessons to his ""daughter."" Lacking screen time and an insightful screenplay Singh resorts to tactics like this. Theres something disquieting about how Self/less handles violence in the presence of a child. Damian Mark II retains the muscle memory and instincts for hand-to-hand combat possessed by his bodys previous inhabitant.  He uses these to kill (sometimes brutally) the men pursuing him. This is of course standard operating procedure for a thriller except that Damian does a lot of his bloodiest work while his young ""daughter"" is watching. (To be fair Mom occasionally tries to shield her.) Way to traumatize the kid for the rest of her life although she doesnt seem the least bit bothered by it. Its clear that the screenwriters dont think of the child as a real person; shes a plot element designed to soften Damian and make him more heroic. The ending is a cheat more dispiriting than anything to precede it. (Ands no dearth of examples - like the flashback/visions that lead Damian first to his ""family"" then provide him with enough information to locate Albrights super-secret lair.) Unwilling to confront the twin issues of immorality and identity destruction in their fullest terms the film simply waves a magic wand. Poof No consequences or ramifications. Self/less is too badly made to entertain audiences in search of escapist entertainment and too insulting for viewers hoping for more.

Ben Kingsley stars as billionaire industrialist Damian Hale in ""Self/less."" (Alan Markfield / Gramercy Pictures) Gary Goldstein The elaborately convoluted soul-swapping thriller ""Self/less"" squanders its intriguing premise with a loud and labored beat-the-bad-guys trajectory.Directed by Tarsem Singh (""The Cell"") from a dizzying script by Alex Pastor and David Pastor the result is a depressingly slick and empty house of cards that collapses under the weight of its muddled intentions. Damian Hale (Ben Kingsley plying a ridiculous New York accent) is a steely rich industrialist in his late 60s whos dying of cancer. When he learns about a covert process called ""shedding"" in which a sick persons consciousness can be transferred into a healthy new body Hale plunks down a fortune endures a publicly staged death and undergoes the life-altering operation. (The procedure is all whirring MRI-like tubes and weird mesh face masks that like everything else here defies scrutiny.)When Damian wakes up hes now ""occupying"" the body of a hunky 35-year-old dubbed Edward (Ryan Reynolds) whos supposedly some pre-fabricated fellow birthed in a laboratory. However as shedding mastermind Albright (Matthew Goode) will eventually tell Damian/Edward ""Every medical advance has a cost."" And hes not just talking financially. Following a period of rehab in Albrights New Orleans facility and an invigorating period of youthful hedonism Damian/Edward realizes hes in an actual human body a Missouri Army veteran named Mark whos been presumed dead by his wife Madeline (Natalie Martinez) and their young daughter Anna (Jaynee-Lynne Kinchen). 10000 Km navigates long-distance couples cyber disconnect Sheri Linden Necessity is the mother of invention in ""10000 Km"" for the characters and filmmaker alike.

Its a Ryan Reynolds vehicle of an altogether different kind.It teams him with a stylish director Tarsem Singh (Mirror Mirror) and estimable castmates in Ben Kingsley Natalie Martinez Matthew Goode and Victor Garber.Self/less looks like high-minded sci-fi going in exploring the concept of whether minds (and souls) or physical bodies define humanity.A dying New York billionaire named Damian (Kingsley) is offered a way out of mortality by mysterious scientist Prof. Albright (Goode) via a revolutionary body-transfer process called ""shedding."" In exchange for a large basket of dollars Damian can trade his worn-out body for a youthful new model one that Albright suggests has been grown from cells in the lab.Damian has misgivings but he also has no time to waste. He awakens to see a young face and buff body in the mirror that he doesnt recognize (Reynolds). Hes now called Edward beginning a new life in New Orleans but he still thinks and feels like Damian -- until he starts getting strange flashbacks along with questions about the origin of his new body.The screenplay by Spanish brothers David and Alex Pastor quickly devolves into a generic thriller. Singhs flair for daring visuals might have saved this picture but he seems singularly uninspired -- a chase scene on a highway looks like a bunch of Hollywood stuntmen demonstrating how they do chase scenes.The acting is equally bloodless which is appropriate to the theme I suppose. But any hope Reynolds had of reviving his stardom with Self/less is as fruitless as thinking a person can swap bodies without consequence.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Alan Markfield/Gramercy Pictures hide caption toggle caption Alan Markfield/Gramercy Pictures Madeline (Natalie Martinez) and daughter Anna (Jaynee-Lynne Kinchen) with Young Damian/Edward (Ryan Reynolds) in Self/less. Alan Markfield/Gramercy Pictures The rich are different from you and me. They can buy fresh bodies when the old ones wear out. Well at least they can in Self/less a movie that raises provocative questions about identity and then doesnt think about them at all. In this sci-fi fantasy rebottling your soul in a new vessel begets not contemplation but chase scenes. Lots of chase scenes. Thats surprising only because the thing was directed by Tarsem Singh whose resume includes such nutty but singular fables as The Cell and The Fall. Singh once seemed an original but Self/less doesnt have a distinctive bone in either of its bodies. The movie begins in a demimonde so garishly opulent that it was partly filmed in Trump Tower. Played by Ben Kingsley with a New York accent the size of the Bronx Damian is a wealthy real estate developer with terminal cancer. Hes not too busy dying however to forgo having a young competitor to lunch so he can humiliate him. Damian lives alone in an absurdly rococo mega-condo and has one regret He neglected his daughter (Michelle Dockery) who was sufficiently traumatized by dads disinterest to grow up to be a community organizer. She rejects her old man in the most hurtful way possible by declining his money. Perhaps Damian can make amends once he gets his replacement bod which scientific entrepreneur Dr. Albright (Matthew Goode) claims he grew in a lab. The procedure is all hush-hush requiring maximum deniability. Damian must first stage his own death before reincarnating as Edward (Ryan Reynolds) a slab of beef so bland he might be mistaken for tofu. Overseen by Anton (Derek Luke) Edward begins his new existence in a French Quarter town house bedding a string of sexy extras during a perfunctory let-the-good-times-roll montage. Life No. 2 is good until Edward notices the signs that his body is a used model. It sports a partially erased tattoo on one bulky bicep and suffers traumatic flashbacks to a previous family and combat in a desert clime. The military training will prove useful when Damian/Edward experiences a major case of buyers remorse. He breaks with Albright an Oxbridge Dr. Frankenstein who is -- of course -- not what he seems. The maddened scientist sends Anton and other thugs after his dissatisfied client as Edward goes in search of the wife and young daughter (Natalie Martinez and Jaynee Lynne-Kinchen) he somehow recalls. For Damian or whats left of him this could be a chance to do right by his or somebodys daughter. He might finally commit an act of selflessness which would give the title a meaning thats a bit more complex than the movies plot. The action gallops across familiar territory and not just because it was mostly shot in Louisiana a state whose generous tax-credit policies have enticed scores of recent B-movies. Alex Pastor and David Pastors script recalls such predecessors as 1960s Eyes Without a Face and 1966s Seconds as well as many lesser life-swapping flicks. (Face/Off anybody?) If the filmmakers had injected a few ideas and if Reynolds were capable of conveying any emotions other than befuddlement and affability the movie could have transcended its storys predictability. But perhaps that was impossible. The destiny of a reincarnated soul its said is preordained by the acts of its prior life. In other words being kind of dull is Self/less karma.

Comments Self/less Rated PG-13  115 minutes  2015 The first half hour of this sci-fi thriller plays like an update of John Frankenheimers cult classic Seconds (1966) as a dying billionaire (Ben Kingsley) agrees to let a mysterious organization transfer his mind into the body of a younger man (Ryan Reynolds). But whereas Frankenheimer took his premise in the direction of Kafkaesque metaphysical horror Self/less quickly settles into a routine shoot-em-up with Reynolds defending himself and a beautiful woman (Natalie Martinez) from shadowy figures who want them dead. Tarsem Singh who directed the eye-catching The Fall (2006) and Immortals (2011) brings a comparable level of visual invention to this tale though as usual his engagement with the material doesnt go very deep.

Despite its sort of sci-fi premise -- what if you could shed your worn-out body and transfer yourself into a newer healthier model? -- the film is much more about the change that may come from walking a mile in someone elses shoes -- and also feet -- than it is about anxiety over death or the strange marriage of body and soul. It helps in terms of crowd-pleasing that the feet (and legs torso arms face voice....) belong to the handsome capable Ryan Reynolds. And it helps that for a while at least both the white and black hats are tinged with gray. Best of all director Tarsem Singh reins in his penchant for visual overload letting ruined Mardi Gras floats and portable labs do their spooky work without fuss. And if the climax indulges in brute-force drudgery the finish is simply satisfying. 2015. -- Matthew Lickona This movie is not currently in theaters.

(Alan Markfield/Gramercy Pictures via AP)(Photo Alan Markfield AP)Story HighlightsKingsley and Reynolds are good but nothing alike.The movie tries too many genres without success.Critics rating 2.5 stars out of 5There is a certain type of movie that is perfect for when you have come home from a long day of work or maybe a really good party and you feel like plopping down on the couch and just kind of halfway watching a movie.It doesnt have to be great it doesnt particularly have to make sense -- in fact it may make so little sense that it doesnt really matter if you finish it before you doze off. It just has to have occasionally interesting bits and pieces that keep you entertained for a time nothing more. A little action doesnt hurt. And any other time its not worth your while.That describes ""Self/less"" Tarsem Singhs mediocre action drama that turns an intriguing idea into a B-movie action flick.The film begins with Damian (Ben Kingsley) a New York real-estate titan eviscerating a young rival over lunch. Then Damian confides in his business partner Martin (Victor Garber) that he is dying and wont live out the year.But Damian finds a business card from the Phoenix Biogenic company a hush-hush outfit that for a steep price offers to put Damian into a younger healthier lab-created body. It requires adopting a new identity and severing ties with his past life -- including Martin and Damiens estranged daughter Claire (Michelle Dockery) with whom he occasionally tries to mend fences by way of his massive checkbook.Soon the Phoenix company is faking Damians death and the next thing you know he no longer looks like Kingsley but Ryan Reynolds. I like both actors but youd be hard-pressed to find two that were more different in acting styles. Maybe thats the point but its a little odd. (If it sounds like ""Seconds"" the 1966 John Frankenheimer thriller starring Rock Hudson well yeah.)This photo provided by Gramercy Pictures shows Ben Kingsley as billionaire industrialist Damian Hale in Gramercy Pictures psychological science fiction thriller ""Self/less"" directed by Tarsem Singh and written by Alex Pastor and David Pastor. (Alan Markfield/Gramercy Pictures via AP) (Photo Alan Markfield AP)Whatever the case Damian 2.0 has to undergo extensive rehabilitation just to learn the basics of life again in a new body. Albright (Matthew Goode) the slick buttoned-down doctor who runs Phoenix Biogenic ships Damian to New Orleans where Singh captures a lot of the local flavor though more as window dressing than context. He lives a hedonistic bachelor lifestyle for a while but when he skips his medication he suffers what seems to be flashbacks. Strange because this is supposed to be a brand-new body.Albright writes it off to glitches in the process but Damian is suspicious. Then the movie shifts gears and becomes an action thriller but it would spoil things to say why. After the action the movies finds time for rather gooey bonding though its also difficult to say between whom without again saying too much.The science of it doesnt hold up but thats not a fatal flaw. Its a movie so playing with reality is a viable option. But there are nagging little details that take you out of the action (or bonding or whatever is going on depending on where were at). Sometimes that can be fun but Singh and screenwriters David and Alex Pastor dont seem to be using these as plot devices. Theyre just there.Its fun to watch Kingsley the business titan at work and Reynolds learn how to be Reynolds or Kingsley or the hybrid or whatever it is. Goode excels at playing haughty characters who never get ruffled. This is a first-rate cast in a second-rate story with some entertaining bits and some maddening holes. That combination works for late-night channel surfing. Anywhere else not so much.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

Read the full review. Blue Sky Studios/Twentieth Century Fox Film Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. By Ann Hornaday July 9 2015 Follow AnnHornaday Can Ryan Reynolds not catch a break? Handsome funny blessed with a silky sonorous voice he was primed to become a go-to actor for anyone casting a glossy sophisticated star vehicle. Instead hes been stuck in well-meaning but undistinguished efforts like ""Buried"" and ""Woman in Gold"" or out-and-out duds like ""Green Lantern"" ""The Captive"" and now ""Self/less."" Here Reynolds plays Damian Hale a multimillionaire who lives in gold-leafed splendor that would make Carmela Soprano blush. But he has been stricken with metastatic cancer of the liver and lungs. Actually Ben Kingsley plays that version of Damian Hale a financial predator who plies Manhattans asphalt seas with the dead eyes of a man-eater. Reynolds plays Hale in another incarnation after his dying self has paid a visit to a mysterious doctor (Matthew Goode) who from the dimly lit recesses of his clinic -- which seems to be located in the middle of an installation at Art Basel -- assures Hale that with just a few hundred million dollars he can cheat death and live if not forever at least for several more years. If the plot sounds familiar its because its as old as time and served as the subject of one of cinemas great cult classics John Frankenheimers audacious 1966 drama ""Seconds."" (In that film the man longing for a second life played by John Randolph came back as Rock Hudson.) One might think that ""Self/less"" would exhibit similar artistic flourishes having been directed by Tarsem Singh who made the visionary if not always perfectly coherent ""The Fall"" as well as seminal music videos. But ""Self/less"" bears not a trace of Singhs signature visual richness quickly devolving into a tiresome game of cat and mouse padded with cliched fight scenes car chases and shootouts. As always Reynolds does his dogged best to look serious and sincere but he cant rescue a film that flounders almost from its first moments. Even the Brits in the movie -- Goode Kingsley and ""Downton Abbeys"" Michelle Dockery as Hales neglected daughter -- cant elevate material that brings nothing novel or arresting to an already hoary idea. And Sir Ben has a lot of explaining to do about that New York accent he affects in the films early scenes. ""Self/less"" ultimately earns its title but it could just as easily have been called ""Brain/less"" ""Pulse/less"" and ""Point/less."" PG-13. At area theaters.

The movie opens Friday July 10 at Bay Area ... more Photo Grammercy Pictures Self/less is a tired retread of a better movie 1 / 1 Back to Gallery ""Self/less"" is a mediocre thriller with a decent premise but it gets additional points off for being irritating. What makes it irritating is that its an apparent rip-off of another movie that did something similar only better. That is much better as in the difference between a borderline classic and a movie no one will be thinking about past next Tuesday. The idea here is that Ben Kingsley as a fabulously wealthy and fatally ill man agrees to have his consciousness transferred to another body so as to start life anew. He undergoes a secret and illegal procedure engineered by a private company and goes from a sick man staring into the grave to a handsome young man picking up women in nightclubs. In addition to this new lease on life he gets to keep most of his money. The only catch is that he has to completely give up his former identity. Everyone hes ever known must believe that hes dead. He has to start all over and even with every advantage in the world thats hard. He is losing his life just as much as if hes died only this way he gets to stick around and mourn. This leads our hero from an unspecific restlessness into trouble. If this sounds like a promising avenue for existential exploration dont see ""Self/less."" Instead rent the 1966 John Frankenheimer movie ""Seconds"" which deals with the fascinating consequences of the premise -- such as what it is like to be 70 but look 40 -- while still being more dramatic and exciting and considerably more creepy than ""Self/less."" Did no one connected with this film -- the actors the writers or director Tarsem Singh -- grasp that half the appeal of the setup derives from our believing that Ryan Reynolds is really Ben Kingsley inside? Perhaps not. After all Kingsley starts the movie with an almost impossibly thick New York accent. Yet when he becomes Reynolds suddenly he sounds like Ryan Reynolds in every other movie. Why would someone who talks in such a distinctive way lose that upon waking up in another body? This kind of imprecision is hardly encouraging and it indicates something that becomes clear soon enough. The filmmakers arent really interested in the ideas ""Self/less"" incites. Rather they simply intend to use the premise as the platform for another typical action thriller. Thus we end up with Reynolds running around with a gun. And there are bad guys coming after him as if anyone watching should care. Singh has visual flair and the script by David and Alex Pastor gives him opportunities to express through images a single consciousness being bombarded by memories from conflicting sources. Singhs elan buys him some time but ultimately theres no concealing the emptiness of the enterprise. In essence everything good in ""Self/less"" was derived from ""Seconds"" and everything bad the writers and the director came up with on their own.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Ben Kingsley is a powerful actor who often shows up a la Al Pacino in scripts he must have chosen through optimism rather than intuition. Indian director Tarsem Singh is a wiz with visuals and famous for loopy fantasies like ""Immortals"" and ""Mirror Mirror."" Ryan Reynolds ... well hes sort of amiable. All three join forces in ""Self/less"" a science-fiction thriller that is generally clue/less largely point/less and certainly couldnt care/less. Kingsley does his full Pacino snarl as Damian Hale a Manhattan real estate billionaire who smites his financial enemies with derogatory Donald Trump-style ""Youre fired"" zingers. (Thats not an accident. Several scenes are filmed inside Trump Tower.) Damians blowhard buccaneer personality has alienated his grown daughter (Michelle Dockery of ""Downton Abbey"") who works for a needy local charity rather than give in to Dads attempts to bribe her back into his gold-plated heart. But he is not an entirely selfish man. Knowing that no one takes his fortune to the beyond and that his advanced cancer means he hasnt much time to settle his affairs he contracts with secretive medical researcher Prof. Albright (Matthew Goode) to transplant his consciousness. He awakes in the form of Ryan Reynolds with a swanky New Orleans bachelor pad a vast trust fund and a new identity. All of this will remain available if he takes his daily dose of memory pills but when a fellow is busy seducing women and playing championship basketball with the locals he can be a bit forgetful. Soon hes having mental blips about doing black-ops service in Afghanistan leaving an abandoned family and setting up a scam to finance his ill daughters endless medical bills by donating his hunky armed-forces body for a rich old man to occupy. The new version of Damian being nicer than the original he sets out to learn who his battle-hardened muscles used to belong to beating up as many opponents as needed. Which is more exciting than telling them theyre fired. When that gets dull there are pistols shotguns and the occasional flamethrower. The notion of taking a new identity made a fine foundation for John Frankenheimers ""Seconds"" and Michelangelo Antonionis ""The Passenger."" Those films were fascinating character pieces about transferring from old mistakes into a new way of life with interesting ideas about the emotional moral and scientific consequences. ""Self/less"" follows that path briefly before veering off into slam-bang-boom combat designed to bruise fists and chins empty ammo clips and pulverize speeding cars. And then ending with a shamelessly contrived happy finale thats only a beat or two short of fireworks and marching bands. Disappointingly Kingsley and Reynolds must not have met on the set. While Paul Dano and John Cusack did an impressive duo job in ""Love amp; Mercy"" as the young and old Brian Wilson this films co-stars dont seem to have even watched each others daily footage.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Tarsem Singh (The Fall Mirror Mirror) has a thing for rococo interiors and exotic architecture but aside from a handful of scenes--a Donald Trump-like Manhattan apartment covered in gold leaf a makeshift lab with translucent walls--the new sci-fi thriller Self/less never gives him a chance to indulge in fantastical spaces which partly explains why its the first of the directors movies to seem short on imagination. Terminally ill real estate billionaire Damian Hale (Ben Kingsley doing a clipped approximation of a Queens accent) pays 250 million to a shady organization in order to have his mind transferred into a new body. Given a new identity as ""Eddie Kidner"" (Ryan Reynolds who doesnt seem to be playing the same person as Kingsley) a 35-year-old retired entrepreneur he is relocated to production-incentive-friendly New Orleans and given a chance to start over albeit under the watchful eye of minders who keep him supplied with little red anti-rejection pills while his mind gets used to its new home.Singhs signature has always been converging aesthetics but here he mostly sticks to a bland contemporary thriller look color-graded cornflower blue. Despite an early twist that lends the high concept a shade of poignancy Self/less never really gets over the fact that much of it consists of a bland-ish raincoat-clad everyman driving around and pointing guns at people before the inevitable underwhelming confrontation with the big bad. (There is a germ of a capitalist critique here too but like most of the storys most interesting ideas it is left undeveloped.) Singh has developed a cult following for his extravagant attempts at visualizing the workings of the mind--in The Fall and his debut The Cell--but the best he comes up with for the hallucinations and memory lapses Damian suffers as a result of the procedure are digital warbles sprinkled with the occasional out-of-place horse. Its only during the percussive abstracted montage that introduces Damians new life in New Orleans that the viewer gets a sense that theres a creative personality at work here thats in any way out-of-step with the Hollywood mainstream. But as in Seconds--the creepy John Frankenheimer movie from which Self/less borrows many key plot points--theres an undeniable morbid sadness to the amnesia-themed-shooter premise especially once it expands to include more ""shedders"" as the newly re-housed are called a Russian goon whos jumped bodies so many times that hes turned animalistic; a child being raised in a house without mirrors unaware that his parents had him transferred into a healthy new body; a young-looking shedder who pays regular visits to an elderly spouse whose Alzheimers cant be cured by a new body. One still cant shake the sense that a movie with so many weird concepts--say a secret body-swapping business operating out of a warehouse for Mardi Gras floats or a death-like state being induced by a cup of poisoned chicory--should be weirder. In other words it probably shouldnt star Ryan Reynolds who is generally likable but frequently miscast. Only Kingsleys bizarre severely mannered performance seems to be following the undercurrents of the material.For thoughts on and a place to discuss the plot details not talked about in this review visit Self/less spoiler space.

In ""Self/Less"" a posh silly sci-fi thriller the advice was this If you want to swap your aging cancer-ridden body for a younger healthier model DO NOT choose a body-swapping company whose facilities seem to consist of a suite of rooms divided by hanging plastic sheets. It will only end as we learn in ""Self/Less"" in tears. So here we have Damien (Ben Kingsley) a Manhattan industrialist so rich he has a fountain in his gilt-edged living room. Hes terminally ill but hes not going gentle into that presumably gilt-edged night; oh no hes going to start over in a handsome new body (Ryan Reynolds) convinced of the wisdom of this decision by the mysterious Albright (Matthew Goode). The company over which Albright purringly presides offers ""humanitys greatest minds more time to reach their perfection""; in other words they put a sick old guy into a tube and a healthy young guy comes out. What could possibly go wrong? Plenty -- as it turns out there are a few side effects involved with body-swapping; namely the history of the bodys previous owner which keeps breaking through in a series of blurry arty flashbacks. ""Self/Less"" soon turns into an attractively shot yet pointless action film with New Damien demonstrating the ability to break a toilet bowl with someones head (really is that even possible?) and lots of bullets flying. Along the way we get lovingly detailed tours of some very nice homes and a quick visit to Damiens estranged daughter Claire (Michelle Dockery) who seems to have been mostly cut out of the movie. Pity; she might have given her father some advice. Movie Review    Self/Less with Ryan Reynolds Natalie Martinez Matthew Goode Victor Garber Derek Luke Michelle Dockery Ben Kingsley. Directed by Tarsem Singh from a screenplay by Alex Pastor and David Pastor. 117 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sequences of violence some sexuality and language. Several theaters.

(Hilary Bronwyn Gayle) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday July 9 2015 200 AM Title SELF/LESS Film Info With Ryan Reynolds Ben Kingsley A rich guys mind gets a new body with predictably troublesome results. Director Tarsem Singh (157) PG-13 Violence. Area theaters. ""SELF/LESS"" is Laughable/Bad. Some of that may actually be deliberate. After all how could a scene not be ridiculous when showing a man having his consciousness put into another mans body using a huge spinning clothes-dryer-like device and what looks like a mask made of pantyhose? On the other hand too much of this sci-fi drama suffers from a clueless hyperserious tone. That takes away the fun of the B-movie conceit. Plus anyone who doesnt see the ending coming needs to retake Body-Switching Class 101. Ben Kingsley is Damian Hale a real estate mogul facing down a terminal cancer diagnosis. (You can tell hes not a good guy because his names Damian.) He receives a mysterious card that leads him to an equally mysterious doctor (Matthew Goode oozing nefarious intent). In a lab in New Orleans that looks like a spa Damian gets a new lease on life. A doc puts Damians mind into a body the doc says has been ""grown"" from tissue just for the procedure. Oops -- not quite. The body is actually that of a young vet named Edward (Ryan Reynolds) believed to be dead in battle. He had a wife and daughter. If Damian-as-Edward takes the pills that the doc assures him will stave off the cold sweats and flashbacks eventually the vets memories will go away. But the more Damian investigates the life hes taken over the more he feels guilty about the family who welcome ""Edward"" back. That just reminds Damian of how he blew off his own now fortyish daughter (Michelle Dockery). The best thing about ""Self/Less"" is watching puppy-eyed Reynolds try to approximate Kingsleys sinister intonations and haughty mannerisms. As in ""Face/Off"" ""All of Me"" ""18 Again"" and other body- or image-switching flicks the charade comes with a wink and a nod. Unfortunately the rest of the time we want to nod off. Once Kinglseys gone were stuck with Reynolds who really works best in glib smart-ass roles. When he tries to be earnest its embarrassing. And the script becomes an endless succession of predictable revelations. No one including Damians right-hand man (Victor Garber) is free from guilt. Director Tarsem Singhs previous films include ""The Cell"" and ""The Fall."" Those boasted original visuals but here he trods through the film like a dental technician handling a routine checkup. ""Self/Less"" is lower-rung sci-fi drama. It would play better if another genre movies soul -- like say the recent ""Ex Machina"" -- had been shoved into this one. As it is its brainless.

Photo Gramercy Pictures MOVIE REVIEW Self/less Running time 120 minutes. Rated PG-13 (violence sexuality profanity). The dawn of genetic engineering has presented Hollywood with fresh new opportunities to present trite old ideas. ""Self/less"" is a celluloid smoothie blended from dozens of familiar elements but its neither tasty nor nutritious. Trying to be both a thoughtful sci-fi parable like ""Gattaca"" and a cheesy B-movie that borrows heavily from ""The Bourne Identity"" ""Self/less"" opens in the world of New York real estate development where a ruthless tycoon named Damian (Ben Kingsley) has alienated his lefty-activist daughter (Michelle Dockery). She wants no part of the fortune he must leave behind as he fights a losing battle with cancer. But why bother with boring estate planning when you can start over? A mysterious entrepreneur (Matthew Goode) offers Damian a chance to be young again in a newly created laboratory-fresh body that to you and me looks a lot like Ryan Reynolds. A silly movie that goes nowhere in its efforts to explore the dramatic and moral parameters of Damians choice ""Self/less"" doesnt even bother to maintain a consistent personality between the two bodies inhabited by the same mind and soul. Kingsleys character is a total bastard but Reynoldss is cool relaxed and kind-hearted part frat boy and part golden retriever. Even though snaky Damian has merely shed one skin and adopted another he seems to have undergone a completely unearned rebirth of his soul. Instead of working out the possibilities though the movie rushes on into ""Bourne"" territory with Damian discovering he suddenly has the hand-to-hand combat skills of a war veteran as well as hallucinations that look a lot like memories from somebody elses life. ""Self/less"" is far too shallow to be shelved under smart sci-fi and as an action thriller its dull and predictable. Every time director Tarsem Singh roars away on what he thinks is a devastating twist youll already be there five minutes ahead and waiting for him to catch up.

But the lofty ambitions trite messages half-hearted allegories and over-the-top caricatures make director Tarsem Singhs (""The Cell"" ""The Fall"") latest a misguidedly campy experience.Here the dying man Damian (Kingsley) is possibly the worst person in the world. In the opening scene he destroys a young competitor who is aiming to encroach on his real estate empire.Damian you see is extremely wealthy and powerful. Hes ""the man who built New York from the ground up"" and he can ruin anothers life before lunch almost for sport.Hes also only got six months to live. His cancer has metastasized and he has yet to come to terms with it. He hasnt even told his daughter (""Downton Abbeys"" Michelle Dockery in a tiny role) although well soon find out that theyre estranged.This is a selfish egotistical man. The type who walks all the way over to the drivers side of his town car to knock on the window so the driver will get out and open the passenger seat door for him. The type who is so consumed with his own specialness that he will pay 250 million for a new ""vessel"" for his brilliant mind. The type who also craves immortality so wholly that he doesnt ask too many questions about the origins of the new body.The doctor behind the controversial ""shedding"" procedure Albright (a mustache-twirling Matthew Goode) snivels that the bodies are grown in labs. Right.Anyway in his new youthful body Damian goes off to live in New Orleans to play pickup basketball party and get girls -- a lot of them. (Theres an entire montage of young beauties falling on his bed). Because even with 86 years of wisdom when youre suddenly given the body of Ryan Reynolds priorities shift. So much for using that great mindAnd this is the main problem. In Kingsleys Damian was a sour ruthless brilliant man whod constructed his own empire in a lifetime. Reynolds Damian is a little dopey deeply curious and empathetic from the start lacking even an ounce of that bitter eagle-eyed intensity and captain of industry drive.Its as though theyre just two completely different men which makes for a far less interesting film especially when Damian begins to suspect that perhaps his new body didnt come out of a lab.Young Damian starts having visions of a life on a farm with a woman and child. Albright swears theyre hallucinations but Damian is compelled to investigate -- perhaps his most out of character move. Why would he start caring about others now?That curiosity gets him entangled in the lives of the women in his visions Madeline (Natalie Martinez) and young daughter Anna (Jaynee-Lynne Kinchen) who he now feels obligated to protect from a murderous Albright and his thugs.The rest of the movie is a cat and mouse chase. Despite some gorgeous studied visuals it all feels rather standard with increasingly diminished returns.""Self/less"" imagines itself as a high-concept redemption tale. But in execution its more concerned with the action than the big questions or dark implications which stay at surface level in the script from Alex Pastor and David Pastor.Damian makes a few sacrifices along the way (although theyre also primarily selfish acts) and finds a certain peace amid the chaos but we never cared. The movie just assumes the audience will develop some empathy for him along the way never wondering why wed ever root for this awful billionaire-- even in Ryan Reynolds body.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare A wealthy man dying from cancer undergoes a radical medical procedure in an attempt to save his life in Self/less.

He is 68 years old and he has cancer. He has been fighting it for a while but now it has metastasized. According to his doctors he has only a few months left. But Damian is rich. Very rich. Which means he always has at least one more chance than we do. And so Damian signs up for a kind of swap in which his consciousness is slipped into a new body and his old body is destroyed. Except that this isnt a ""new"" body as promised. Its actually slightly used. And after a while Damian finds the previous owner is trying to re-take control of the wheel. Thats the plot of ""Self/less"" which - starting right with that cutesy title - is not quite as smart and subversive as the old cult sci-fi thriller ""Seconds"" which had millionaire John Randolph ponying up some cash to turn himself into Rock Hudson. But its still pretty good sci-fi for grownups with a terrific sense of visual style. That comes courtesy of Tarsem Singh who made the literally nightmarish ""The Cell"" about a decade ago - and then seemed to lose his way a bit. But he never forgot his flair for visuals which was evident even in a slightly campy fairy tale like ""Mirror Mirror."" His wonderful eye is hard at work here too. Some of the film is flashy and even-showoffy - like the blurry stuttering color-saturated images that accompany Damians encroaching disorienting memories. But much of it is subtler work. Like the bright yellows that light up a happy scene in New Orleans or the set design - all plastic translucent tunnels - that mark the secret lab. Also to his credit Singh digs deep into the feel and culture of a place whether its the power lunch at New Yorks fabled Four Seasons or a surreal Mardi Gras warehouse in Louisiana. True the script doesnt always live up to the visuals. The movie seems to set up Damian played by Ben Kingsley as a horrible billionaire - loveless estranged from his only child and gleefully wrecking the careers of those who crossed him. (Plus he lives in the most whorishly decorated Manhattan home since Bob Gucciones.) But then once Damian does his little personality transference - which basically involves getting pushed into an MRI machine and turning into Ryan Reynolds - he suddenly seems to be this joyful humanistic guy (note that awful title again). Its a short-cut and a cheat - the movie transforms him from villain to hero without showing us why. Once Reynolds does take over though Damian is a more-than-capable good guy (with an action-hero skill set he remembers Jason-Bourne-like from his past life.) Which is good because soon he - and his donors widow and child - are being chased around by that body-swap corporation which is worried that Damians going to somehow screw up their very smooth very secret operation. Singh stages the big action sequences - an assault on a farmhouse the requisite car chase and the final fiery confrontation - all quickly and capably and if Reynolds is as always a little bland he handles himself well. Hes good in the quieter scenes too - particularly the tender ones with his donors little girl (newcomer Jaynee-Lynne Kinchen who is unspoiled and terrific). There are still some big sci-fi and action movies still to come this summer almost all of them with bigger stars and longer pedigrees. But give ""Self/less"" a try. Like its hero its an interesting combination - and it might just surprise you in how good it can be. Self/less (PG-13) Focus (116 min.) Directed by Tarsem Singh. With Ryan Reynolds Ben Kingsley.

Self/less Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2015) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/selfless-2015,200,selfless24,selfless,rogerebert
"Self/less review Re-animation will cost ya pal - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Self/less review Re-animation will cost ya pal Self/less Hilary Bronwyn Gayle / Gramercy Pictures Ryan Reynolds stars as Young Damian in ""Self/less."" Ryan Reynolds stars as Young Damian in ""Self/less."" (Hilary Bronwyn Gayle / Gramercy Pictures) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Remember the Rock Hudson movie ""Seconds""? ""Self/Less"" certainly does. In the ineffectual new fantasy-thriller ""Self/less"" the fantastical plot device -- a body-switching process costing millions and not covered by any known health plan -- is called ""shedding."" You buy yourself a new longer life in a younger persons body and your troubles are over. Or ARE THEY?Ben Kingsley sounding like a compendium of every attempt at a New York accent ever heard in the movies plays Damian Hale a Trump-like Manhattan developer (i.e. hes a selfish bastard) who beats a terminal cancer prognosis by hooking up with a mysterious biogenic company run by purring movie-stealing Matthew Goode. Early on in ""Self/less"" Hale gets zwooped into the body of a new human vessel portrayed by top-billed Ryan Reynolds. The intrigue in ""Self/less"" only occasionally intriguing comes with the complications. When Kingsleys character turns into Reynolds his memories are no longer strictly his own. In his addled minds eye the new Hale experiences flashes of another life a different past. Its up to this new strapping version of Hale to figure out what shedding entails and learn the identity of the woman (Natalie Martinez) he cant get out of his head.Most of ""Self/less"" takes place in New Orleans which has two advantages to a modestly budgeted project such as this one. One Its a place that reeks of death and rebirth photogenically. And two Louisianas one of the cheapest places you can make a movie. The producers of ""Self/less"" scored a solid success with the inventive cleverly elaborated ""Looper."" Its possible director Tarsem Singhs film will receive a similarly warm welcome. But I doubt it. Singhs previous work includes ""The Cell"" (Jennifer Lopez in a series of swanky nightmare scenarios) and ""The Fall"" a strange grandiose somewhat icky adventure story set in the silent film era. ""Self/less"" is much smaller and not nearly strange or transporting enough. Small can be good in speculative fiction; look at ""Ex Machina"" for example. This script by Alex Pastor and David Pastor reveals its secrets predictably and Singh struggles to make his locations come alive on screen. Stupid as it sounds a few more extras wouldnt have hurt. There are times as when Reynolds drives down a highway at night pursued by members of the company who wants him dead when the landscape is as desolate as ""Zombieland."" Self/less (Clip) Clip from ""Self/less"" Exclusive Endeavor (ScreenPlay) Clip from ""Self/less"" Exclusive Endeavor (ScreenPlay) See more videos Reynolds can be charming and effective as a leading man in both comedy and drama but his somewhat glazed expression and tweezed good looks can work against him. The cast including ever-reliable Victor Garber as Hales longtime friend and colleague does what it can. ""Self/less"" hews closely enough to the premise of the 1966 John Frankenheimer thriller ""Seconds"" to qualify as an unofficial remake.

Still that (admittedly pointless) use of punctuation is one of the few things going for Self/Less a tepid sci-fi thriller that takes an interesting premise and sacrifices ideas for the sake of logically challenged action beats. Ben Kingsley plays Damian a ruthless New York real estate tycoon who lives in an opulent gold-leafed penthouse. He has the world at his feet but hes still dying of terminal cancer--and with only six months to live hes willing to try something drastic. For the low price of a quarter-billion dollars the brilliant Dr. Albright (Matthew Goode) will take his consciousness and transfer it into a brand new lab-grown body that looks an awful lot like Ryan Reynolds. Though he has to sever ties with business partner Martin (Victor Garber) and estranged daughter Claire (Michelle Dockery) the newly sorta-immortal Damian enjoys his youthful escapades in New Orleans playing street basketball and bedding lovely ladies in a montage. But before too long things start to unravel. Reynolds-Damian starts to see visions of war and a mysterious family he doesnt recognize and Albright might not be entirely truthful with him. Once he hooks up with Madeline (Natalie Martinez) its a race to see whether he can get the answers he needs before a mysterious cabal kills everybody. Self/Less suggests plenty of questions about the nature of identity the morality of scientific exploration and the price of aging. But the script penned by brothers David and Alex Pastor doesnt craft characters complicated enough to engage in those concepts. Instead once the non-twists of Self/Less start unraveling the film becomes little more than a series of chases and super-boneheaded plot holes. For example just how secret is ""shedding"" which is what the consciousness transference process is called? Albright seems to be desperate to keep everything underground and yet characters easily read about details of it on Wikipedia? Though Reynolds seems a little lost and Kingsley is hamstrung by his goofy New Yawk accent during his brief tenure in the picture the rest of the cast helps hold down the edges of Self/Less withering circus tent. Goode is particularly effective as the sinister scientist and though shes barely in the film Dockery adds some much-needed gentle grace to an otherwise leaden series of plot points. Self/Less greatest crime is that its not enough of anything Not brainy enough to party with the theories about consciousness that Ex-Machina delivered earlier this year nor is it over-the-top enough to compete with the campy goofballery of something like Limitless. Self/Less should have been so much more especially considering it was in the hands of director Tarsem Singh who has created wildly imaginative worlds in films like The Cell and The Fall. Those particular films had sumptuous visuals that more than made up for a supreme lack of storytelling. With a story this murky and characters this broad the least Tarsem could do is give us something bonkers to look at.

Daily Edition Login to download Self/less Film Review 900 AM PDT 7/4/2015 by Stephen Farber FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS A fast-paced sci-fi thriller with too many contrivances TWITTER Ben Kingsley is reincarnated as Ryan Reynolds in this thriller about a sinister organization that provides new identities to the wealthy and powerful. In 1966 John Frankenheimer directed one of his most audacious movies Seconds with a script by Lewis John Carlino from a novel by David Ely. It told the story of an older banker who solicits the help of a shadowy organization that will fake his death and reconstruct him with a brand-new identity as well as a new face and body. The movie was a box-office flop but has developed a cult following over the years and clearly had an influence on the makers of Self/less director Tarsem Singh and screenwriters Alex Pastor and David Pastor. The new film has more of a traditional thriller angle than the Frankenheimer film so might have a better commercial shot though its prospects still seem iffy. Of course Seconds wasnt a brand-new idea even in 1966; it was one of many variations on the Frankenstein myth and weve seen other stories about people going to great lengths to cheat death and seek a second chance. But the similarities between this new film and Frankenheimers movie are too striking to ignore. The failings of Self/less reveal a good deal about what has gone wrong with American movies over the last 50 years. In Seconds the main character played by John Randolph was suffering from severe malaise that led him to take drastic measures. The protagonist of Self/less Damian Hale (Ben Kingsley) is a wealthy businessman who also is haunted by personal dissatisfactions but he has a more immediate problem terminal cancer. So when he learns about a scientific institute that can retain his mind but give him a new healthy body created in a laboratory he jumps at the chance. In the Frankenheimer movie the old man was reincarnated as Rock Hudson and its apt that the younger Damian is portrayed by a contemporary hunk in the Hudson mold Ryan Reynolds. Both Hudson and Reynolds became movie stars on the basis of their looks rather than their acting abilities so the casting makes a certain kind of poetic sense. Once Damian has been reincarnated he adjusts slowly but eagerly to his healthy new body satisfying his hedonistic appetites. Soon however Damian begins to be troubled by mental visions that his handlers assure him are merely hallucinations. But Damian begins to suspect that they are images of events that really happened. Whose past is he remembering? As he searches for answers to the mystery the organization is desperate to keep him from learning the truth. So far so good. There is a neat twist halfway through the film when Damian discovers some startling answers at a farm in Missouri. This exciting sequence is the high point of the film. After that the remaining twists become increasingly far-fetched and the intriguing story degenerates into a flat-out action movie with car chases and violent shoot-outs that are competently filmed by Singh but seem to come from a far more conventional film. In Seconds the villain of the piece was the avuncular head of the organization providing second chances played to sinister perfection by Will Geer. In this new version the head of the institute is a seemingly owlish but ruthless scientist played by Matthew Goode. Goode often plays sympathetic characters (as in The Imitation Game) but he showed in The Lookout that he could make a chillingly nasty villain and he gives the best performance in this film. Derek Luke also makes a strong impression as a stranger who befriends the younger Damian on the streets of New Orleans. Reynolds tries hard but he just cant muster enough expression to make the characters dilemma wrenching. Kingsley has only a small part at the beginning and his exaggerated New Yawk accent will not be remembered as the high point of his acting career. Natalie Martinez plays Damians romantic interest without any special distinction. Michelle Dockery of Downton Abbey has a small role as Damians idealistic daughter. The scene in which Reynolds visits her and tries to make amends for his neglect is reminiscent of a scene in Seconds when Hudson calls on his elderly wife who has no idea that the young man facing her is her husband. Technical credits are solid. Singh and cinematographer Brendan Galvin make good use of the attractive locations. The editing by Robert Duffy helps to paper over the holes in the script and keep the movie hurtling forward. The only truly egregious touch comes at the very end Seconds took the story to a dark but perfectly logical conclusion; Self/less seems to be heading toward an equally melancholy or at least bittersweet conclusion but then lurches unconvincingly toward a blissful reunion on a Caribbean island. Sadly the uncompromising filmmaking of the 1960s is unimaginable for todays craven storytellers and studio executives. Production companies Endgame Entertainment Ram Bergman Prods.

"Self/less Review Ryan Reynolds Miscast in Tarsem Singhs Thriller | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Film Review Self/less Scott Foundas Chief Film Critic foundasonfilm 6 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr July 4 2015 | 0900AM PT Tarsem Singh and the Pastor brothers shame/less riff on John Frankenheimers Seconds transforms Ben Kingsley into Ryan Reynolds. A brand new you that just might be the old someone else is the quandary at the center of ""Self/less"" an initially intriguing parable about mans lust for immortality that quickly devolves into a substandard shoot-em-up designed to rebrand star Ryan Reynolds as a brawny action hero in the Jason Statham mold. But even the resourceful likable Reynolds is at a loss to elevate this rather dreary piece of would-be escapism which calls out for the wry pulpy touch of a John Carpenter (or his acolyte David Twohy) and instead gets the strained self-seriousness of director Tarsem Singh. July 10 release from Universal/Focus relaunched genre label Gramercy Pictures will have its work cut out for it against the big guns of summer. Written by Spanish brothers Alex and David Pastor (whose little-seen 2009 ""Carriers"" was one of the better zombie/virus thrillers of recent vintage) ""Self/less"" cribs freely from just about every mind/body/reality swap movie of the past 50 years with a particular (and uncredited) debt owed to director John Frankenheimer and screenwriter Lewis John Carlinos 1966 ""Seconds"" in which a wealthy but unhappy middle-aged banker (played by actor John Randolph) signs up for a very high-tech facelift that transforms him into the strapping Rock Hudson. Here its a dying Scrooge-like real-estate magnate Damian Hale (Ben Kingsley doing a mile-wide Noo Yawk accent) who plunks down 250 million for the services offered by the mysterious Phoenix Biogenic corporation where the coolly composed CEO (Matthew Goode) promises his clients not just a few nips and tucks but an entirely new healthy younger human body grown organically in the lab. (The process goes by the reptilian name of ""shedding."") In one end of a spinning whirring MRI-like machine goes Damians cancer-ridden corpse and out the other comes Reynolds -- not exactly the Rock Hudson of his day perhaps but certainly nothing to contact the refunds department about. As with Frankenheimers protagonist the ""old"" Damians death is convincingly staged while the ""new"" Damian (rechristened Edward) is shipped off to New Orleans for some post-op Ramp;R and sternly advised to stay away from anyone and anything having to do with his former life. That includes Damians estranged daughter Claire (Michelle Dockery) an ""urban change"" advocate whos about as broadly drawn as Kingsleys accent. (""This isnt work. This is a bunch of children throwing a tantrum"" he scolds her upon visiting her dilapidated cold-water office which looks the way hippie communes did in out-of-touch Hollywood movies of the 60s and 70s.) But at first such loose ends are the furthest thing from Damian/Edwards mind as he cuts loose and parties like its 1959 -- save for the occasional glitches that short-circuit his brain like interference on an over-the-air television set (or more precisely someone elses memories competing for attention with his own). Well suffice it to say that ""Edward"" has a few more miles on him than advertised as well as some special skills (as in Special Forces) that come in handy once Damian starts asking too many questions and finds himself on the run from a vast Phoenix Biogenic goon squad led by the hard-to-kill Anton (Derek Luke playing a version of ""The Matrixs"" endlessly regenerative Agent Smith). At which point ""Self/less"" goes through its own ""shedding"" process dropping its high-concept sci-fi facade for the rhythms of a more conventional pursuit thriller before transforming yet again into a mawkish father-daughter bonding drama that finds Damian serving as protector of a beautiful single mom (Natalie Martinez) and her precocious daughter (Jaynee-Lynne Kinchen) who have suffered their own betrayals at the hands of the Phoenix corporation. (Together they all dream of escaping to one of those generic tropical paradises common to travel-agency window displays.) For a while as ""Self/less"" unfurls all of its knotty complications the movie gives off a junkily entertaining vibe like the A-picture knockoffs that used to roll down the assembly line of shlock impresarios Roger Corman and Menahem Golan. But the more the narrative straightens out into a series of shootouts punch-outs and car chases the more monotonous it becomes (especially at 116 minutes). Unlike ""Seconds"" Singhs movie isnt much interested in exploring the psychological consequences of becoming a ""new"" person and it lacks the energy and humor that might have transformed it into a rollicking ""Total Recall""-style caper. The miscast Reynolds holds his own in the fight scenes but seems far too decent to have ever been the cold-blooded capitalist Kingsley plays in the films early scenes -- a man who even with his dying breaths delights in publicly humiliating an ambitious young competitor. Yet the script turns on the notion that Damian is appalled to learn of the lengths to which his latter-day Dr. Frankenstein will go to keep his own business thriving. (Likewise one would think that at the prices hes charging Goodes CEO could find a more secure base for his nefarious operations than a Mardi Gras float warehouse.) Minus the extravagant Ken Russell-ish flourishes of his earlier ""The Cell"" and ""The Fall"" Singh feels very much like a director-for-hire here shooting (with d.p. Brendan Galvin) in the slick but nondescript visual language of luxury-brand advertising. (The end credits offer a special thanks to Donald Trump for allowing several scenes to be filmed inside Trump Tower.) Which is somehow exactly the right look for a movie that vaunts ""the things that really matter in life"" but doesnt have a clue as to what those things actually are.

Rich Lowry says April 6 2016 at 528 am After finding this gem on Netflix I was appalled at how bad it was. The first act is largely composed of montages and moreover as the review says -- the blatant ripoff of Seconds was immediately obvious. For those who havent seen Frankenheimers masterpiece Seconds find it and watch it. I saw Seconds when it came out and it scared the shit out of me. It was one of Rock Hudsons best performances and although it bombed at the box-office its hair-raising ending lived with me for years; it is the ultimate Faustian tale. Self/Less on the other hand with its cleverly manufactured title is entirely forgettable and was a total waste of time. I want the two hours back please. Reply Casandra says July 5 2015 at 1226 pm At least its an original studio movie. That counts for something at least. Reply atomic studio says July 6 2015 at 1117 am i agree. its one thing giving us terrible remakes of movies we dont need to see remade but giving us terrible original movies we dont care to see is something entirely new. Reply Hal says July 4 2015 at 1054 pm Yawn another Ryan Reynolds flop. Reply anyonmous says July 4 2015 at 952 am This looks boring and looks like it will end with him standing after bringing down the cloning company Reply Scarface says July 4 2015 at 1240 pm Who wants to see another million adaption of Peter Pan books? like all those sequels prequels reboots adaptions of books comics video games arent enough? Hollywood should be focusing on original amp; new ideas instead of rebooting Peter Pan for the 7th time.

Ben Kingsley plays a New York real estate mogul who pays big bucks to have his consciousness microwaved into Ryan Reynolds body in ""Self/less"" but the real reheating of leftovers has already occurred this new science-fiction thriller borrows the foundation of a much better film -- John Frankenheimers 1966 ""Seconds"" -- and strips it of any larger meaning. Director Tarsem Singh previously known for such art-direction extravaganzas as ""The Fall"" and ""Immortals"" seems determined to prove that he can handle more mundane material that doesnt call for as much visual flair. The film he has crafted from the script by David Pastor and Alex Pastor remains light on the filigree yes but Singhs earlier films at least offered diversions for the eyes when the stories got bogged down. See Video Ryan Reynolds Battles Ben Kingsley for Control in First Trailer for Sci-Fi Thriller Self/Less (Video) The best that can be said for ""Self/less"" is that unlike so many recent films that have shot in Louisiana strictly for the tax breaks this is a movie that squeezes New Orleans for every last drop of local color it can from jazz bands to Mardi Gras parade floats. (Even chicory coffee plays a key role in the plot.) New York real estate magnate Damian (Kingsley) is close to death; his wealth can no more fix his body than it can repair his relationship with his estranged daughter Claire (Michelle Dockery of ""Downton Abbey"" struggling with a Yank accent). Damian receives a mysterious card that hooks him up with Albright (Matthew Goode) whose company specializes in ""shedding"" a process by which ones mind and memories can be transferred from one body to another. See Photos Deadpool Star Ryan Reynolds Breaks From Shooting to Visit Young Fan Battling Hodgkins Disease (Photos) The company helps Damian fake his own death and then sticks him into an MRI built for two with a new body (Reynolds) that Albright claims has been grown in a lab to be physically perfect. After the transfer and weeks of speech and physical therapy (during which Reynolds makes no effort to impersonate Kingsley) Damian is released into the world with a new identity and a new lease on life. When he forgets to take his regular daily medicine however he starts to have blurry mental flashbacks that make him realize that his new body had a previous tenant who may not be willing to surrender their shared brain. The best science fiction comments on our own world and ""Seconds"" (which also dealt with a shadowy company that helped rich men find new lives) dealt with issues of identity and of redemption. ""Self/less"" makes a few stabs at bigger notions regarding second chances and accepting ones own mortality but its more interested in sending Damian on the run with the understandably upset wife (Natalie Martinez ""End of Watch"") and daughter (Jaynee-Lynne Kinchen) of Reynolds previous incarnation. The story is standard fugitive stuff and the personal connections are severely underwritten; dads are either perfect or distant and wives are compassionate or conniving. (Its an in-joke that two principal female characters are named for Kim Novaks two identities in ""Vertigo."") See Video Ben Kingsley Advises King to Trust No One in New Tut Trailer (Video) About the best that can be said about the sluggish ""Self/less"" is that its a better Ryan Reynolds body-switching movie than ""The Change-Up""; still youre better off seeking out ""Seconds"" -- or heck ""All of Me"" -- instead.
