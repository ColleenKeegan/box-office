Jim Bridges/Picturehouse hide caption toggle caption Jim Bridges/Picturehouse Rocket Sciences Hal Hefner (Reece Thompson) left speechless by girls school and the trials of adolescence in general. Jim Bridges/Picturehouse Director Jeffrey BlitzGenre ComedyRunning Time 98 minutes (Requires RealPlayer) Director Jeffrey Blitz won an Oscar nomination for his first movie Spellbound a documentary about a national spelling bee. Hes still dealing with adolescents and school contests in his first fiction film -- a comedy about a stutterer who joins the debate team to impress a pretty girl. Think you know where this is going? Well Blitz is an outsider to Hollywood and hes going someplace else into quirky indie-flick social satire which isnt an altogether unfamiliar place these days. In fact there have been enough offbeat coming-of-age comedies in just the last couple of years -- The Squid and the Whale Napoleon Dynamite Little Miss Sunshine -- that its possible now to say that this film is unconventional in mostly conventional ways. Still between Blitz who proves a clever writer and director and his young leading man (Reece Thompson who puts a lot of character behind that stutter) the smarts and charm of Rocket Science are simply not open to debate.

Gangly high-school student Hal (Reece Daniel Thompson) is willing to try anything to break free from his nervous stutter even taking up the suggestion of alluring over-achiever Ginny (Anna Kendrick) that joining her on the rapid-fire debating team will be just the thing to unlock his confidence and untie his tongue.To Blitzs credit the movie doesnt follow the obvious path to the final-reel showdown suggesting ambivalence and resilience as life lessons in themselves. With its affectionate tone and poised dialogue theres obvious heart and intelligence at work here but the film is far too caught up in its own smarts piling on a clever-clever voiceover and ultra-whimsical score to bury its human core under layers of indie-movie quirkiness. Theres a lovely fragile movie here; if only Blitz had had the faith to let it stand on its own two feet.

Comments Rocket Science Recommended Five years after directing his hit documentary about spelling bees Spellbound (2002) Jeffrey Blitz returns with a high school comedy that builds on that films winning combination of academic stress and offbeat individuals. A put-upon student with a stuttering problem (Reece Thompson) is dragooned by a ferociously competitive schoolmate (Anna Kendrick) to be her partner on the debate squad and their assigned topic--teaching abstinence in public schools--proves ironic given his deep desire to get his hands on her. The heros sexual feelings are complicated by his situation at home his dad has recently moved out and been replaced by his mothers obnoxious new lover (Steve Park) and his teenage son. Quietly written and convincingly played this coming-of-age story mines its rueful laughs from a thick vein of performance anxiety in both senses of the term. R 98 min. By J.R.

Photo Picturehouse Rocket Science 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Making a good movie may not be rocket science but it does demand a smart mix of elements. Borrowing from too many movies to count Rocket Science botches that brew in an unwieldy slew of adolescent-angst cliches. Mostly it echoes 2005s Thumbsucker almost to the point of being a remake. In each a troubled teen who has a disability and is a loner in high school is tossed onto the debate team for a shot at stepping-up redemption. For Sciences Hal Hefner (Reece Thompson) the affliction is a stutter that doesnt seem to bother anyone in a movie milieu normally marked by cruelty and ostracism. But it does hold back Hal who wants to open up enough to have cool conversations with girls -- and see where they might lead. Enter Ginny (Anna Kendrick) a fiercely driven debater whos going to be New Jerseys state champ if it kills her -- or her partner. Ginny inexplicably recruits Hal to replace gifted but burned out Ben (Nicholas DAgosto) whose film-opening diatribe is one of the best-acted scenes in recent memory. This turns out to be a problem when the film turns out to have almost nothing to do with debate -- even though the debaters topic is juicy and high-school-centric Should sexual abstinence be taught in public schools? Hal has no interest in debating this and proving anything to anyone. Hes only interested in making out with Ginny. Apart from being hotheaded and borderline violent hes a very simple guy. Yet writer-director Jeffrey Blitz tells his tale as if Hal is a new Holden Caulfield dramatizing Hals lust-denied anguish with grand but futile gestures as when he steals whiskey to get drunk or throws a cello through a window to get attention. None of this is very noteworthy about his character beyond the obvious and the mundane He is sexually anxious self-absorbed and insecure. Meet the class of 2007. Having been a stutterer who still became a champion debater Blitz had a much richer story to tell than his unworthy surrogates. Hes also shown strength shining lights on youthful ambitiousness as with his Oscar-nominated 2002 documentary Spellbound. But debate skills are far less vital here -- not when theres routine angst to be lionized to the sound of Violent Femmes tunes not when each adult must be shown as a clueless twit and not when each misfit-teen tactic from Rushmore to Napoleon Dynamite must be dug up and dusted off. Resolved The next teen-angst film should be fresher and better. If he took a timeout from self-absorption even Hal might be able to get behind that. bruce.westbrookchron.com Todays Deals Tory Burch Sale Up to 60% off + free shipping Wide-Ruled 70-Sheet Spiral-Bound Notebook 17 cents + pickup at...

And I liked ""Superbad."" With a spotlight hanging like a full moon of trouble just beyond his profile Plainsboro High School debater Ben Wekselbaum is expertly racing through points about farm subsidies at the New Jersey state policy debate finals. Nicholas DAgosto who portrays the dark-haired golden boy rips through Bens lines at a pace that leaves you breathless. Then Ben falls silent - really silent - to the chagrin of Ginny Ryerson his debate partner. Right now you might be thinking that ""Rocket Science"" will be Bens story. It wont. Writer-director Blitz deftly shifts the weight of the tale from one style of debate to a more familiar sort from one dark-haired teen to a less formed version of the same. Hal Hefners parents arent merely arguing points theyre splitting up. When Hal and Earls father clomps down the stairs he tells them ""I dont know what to say."" Saying and not saying yearning to speak ones desire or frustration and not quite pulling it off is the rough and exhilarating terrain here. Did we mention that Hal (Reece Daniel Thompson) stutters. Badly. In a quietly hilarious scene a young black woman dressed as Abe Lincoln calls upon Hal to help her debate Stephen A. Douglas. ""What cannot a house divided do?"" Abe asks. Then like a gameshow host asks again. Afterward Ginny recruits Hal (Reece Daniel Thompson) to become her new partner in the years debate season. Ginnys heat and this years resolution on teen abstinence - yay or nay - only adds to Hals staccato stammering. From the knowing little ta-ta wave she gives Hal to an omniscient awareness of when shes being looked at Ginny is less an authentic character than a telling projection of the power and prowess teen boys (and their grown-up writerly selves) credit them with having. Weve seen incarnations of Ginny before. Reese Witherspoon in ""Election"" comes vividly to mind. Rachel Evan Wood gave an even more chilling version of manipulative bravado in ""Pretty Persuasion."" Anna Kendrick plays Ginny with a blazing directness that runs roughshod over doubts about veracity. Her Ginny may be a figment but that makes her no less mesmerizing. ""Rocket Science"" is Blitzs first narrative feature. But the director (who stuttered himself before joining his New Jersey high-school debate team) showed facility and great affection for freaks and geeks with ""Spellbound"" the 2002 documentary about endearing oddsters headed to the National Spelling Bee. Whimsy is fast becoming a staple of American misfit flicks and ""Rocket Science"" has its share of goofball asides. Some miss. Most strike a chord. When dorky Lewis (Josh Kay) shows Hal a bra it feels teen-movie familiar. But when Lewis parents play a duet of the Violent Femmes ""Blister in the Sun"" its a minor rapture. Sounding like the Miller High Life guy the narrator (Dan Cashman) hits notes of butch tenderness as he recounts Hals journey from attraction to hurt to pent-up fury and beyond. When Hals romantic vengeance leads him to Trenton N.J. in search of the legendary Ben Wekselbaum the movie looks headed for a commonplace finale. Fear not. Its not.

"Theres something quirky about that boy | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesTheres something quirky about that boyIf you didnt know writer/director Jeffrey Blitz had made Spellbound  the captivating study of young spelling bee contestants you might well guess it from his narrative feature debut.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Aug. 17 2007 Starring Reece Daniel Thompson Anna Kendrick Nicholas DAgosto and Vincent Piazza. Written and directed by Jeffrey Blitz. 98 minutes. At major theatres. 14A  If you didnt know writer/director Jeffrey Blitz had made Spellbound the captivating study of young spelling bee contestants you might well guess it from his narrative feature debut.Article Continued BelowRocket Science which premiered to some acclaim at this years Sundance Film Festival also turns on a competitive wordplay event for brainy students who exhibit similar degrees of awkwardness and brilliance. This time its high school debating and the sweat rolls off furrowed brows just as easily.The difference though is that Blitz has succumbed to that most pernicious of Sundance afflictions pandemic quirkiness. Its what you get when every character in a film has exaggerated eccentricities that either charm or irritate viewers.Put me in the latter group with the caveat that lead quirkster Reece Daniel Thompson does terrific work in a defiantly unglamorous role. Give this man the right script and hell be going places.Hes Hal Hefner a painfully shy student at New Jerseys Plainsboro High School whose life is about to take a turn for the quirky (theres that word again). Despite his debilitating stutter and a family crisis that has consumed whats left of his confidence hes tapped by pushy fellow student Ginny (Anna Kendrick) to be her partner in a debating contest. ""Ive ferreted you"" she tells him in one of her few statements that isnt spit out at machine-gun speed. Doesnt everybody talk like that?A prologue reveals how Ginny was headed for glory in a championship before her silver-tongued partner Ben (Nicholas DAgosto) suddenly changed horses so to speak.Why would Ginny pick a stutterer to launch a new debating challenge? In her mind the greater the handicap the more likely the chance of victory. Or something like that.Hangdog Hal is cautiously willing to go along mostly because he has the hots for Ginny whose physical attributes are thankfully more girl-next-door than supermodel. Will love find a way? Will Hals tongue magically untangle? Will his stupid brother Earl (Vincent Piazza) stop beating up on him? Did the Violent Femmes make some good cash by allowing their slacker anthem ""Blister in the Sun"" to be once again used for commercial purposes?An over-reliance on absurdity such as Hals bizarre habit of dragging luggage everywhere he goes robs Rocket Science of the freshness it smugly presumes to possess.So does Blitzs use of an extraneous all-knowing narrator who sounds suspiciously like a steal from last years Little Children a vastly superior picture about suburban angst.The debating theme is certainly appropriate however. And heres a hot topic for a post-screening coffee klatch Be it resolved that quirkiness in American cinema has been done to death.

"A smart teen who cant get the words out - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Events    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies Movie Review A smart teen who cant get the words out Reece Thompson plays a stutterer who goes out for the high school debate squad. By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  August 17 2007 Movies about American adolescence should be painful to watch. They should make you cringe in the dark damage you with sense memories of acne and isolation and social gaucherie. They rarely do though. Theres always someone having sex with a pie.When its not opting for whimsy ""Rocket Science"" makes you cringe which is whats good about it. A dryly observed coming-of-age comedy-drama about a New Jersey high school stutterer the movies written and directed by Jeffrey Blitz who made the spelling-bee documentary ""Spellbound"" and who here mines his own miserable teenage years for our edification.The main character is Hal Hefner (Reece Thompson) his sexual confidence in inverse proportion to his namesake. Lank-haired eyes a watchful watery blue Hals a smart kid locked in deep-freeze by his inability to speak. Every day he tries to order pizza in the school cafeteria and every day the lunch lady gets fed up with waiting and serves him the fish instead. His parents are divorcing his mother (Lisbeth Bartlett) is dating his best friends dad and his brother (Vincent Piazza) is a thug. ""Too bad youre not bipolar; that I could do something with"" says Hals school therapist (Maury Ginsberg). Why speak at all?Into this hormonal cesspool drops Ginny Ryerson (Anna Kendrick) queen of the Plainsborough High debate squad and everything Hal isnt. She talks blindingly fast -- so the world cant get a word in edgewise basically -- and she believes in nothing. (""It gets in the way."") Having been left high and dry when teammate and local debate god Ben Wekselbaum (Nicholas DAgostino) had an epiphany and walked offstage mid-resolution Ginny has decided to recruit Hal. Shes drawn by his speech disorder saying ""Deformed people are the best. I think its because they have reserves of anger."" Quite so.Some of us remember Kendrick stealing the 2003 movie ""Camp"" with a rendition of Sondheims ""Ladies Who Lunch"" and shes equally coldhearted here -- Bette Davis reborn as a tough amoral high school wonk. Were in her thrall and Hals in Ginnys desperately trying to be the glib smoothie he thinks she wants him to be.If only it were that easy. Another filmmaker would build to a climactic debate triumph but Blitz is seeking smaller sharper emotional truths. ""Rocket Science"" recalls what its like to be a teenage ghost haunting school hallways without being seen and the film tracks Hals growing frustration until it blooms into successive stages of anguish fury and self-assurance. Theres a drunken meltdown too and its a beaut. (All Ill say is that an airborne cello is involved.)Eventually Hal approaches Ben Wekselbaum much the way Luke Skywalker approached Yoda begging the fallen Olympian to tutor him for the state championships. ""Its either love or revenge"" Hal says his path clear at last.""Rocket Science"" gilds the lily with cutesy bits of business on the side -- the narration by an unseen older Hal is too bookish and the musical score tugs your heartstrings even when the script doesnt -- but its honest and surprisingly lucid at its core. Blitz knows the speed-talking debate kids say less than Hal ever will and he understands the bedrock Nietzschean truth about high school That which doesnt kill you makes you stronger. The movie could be subtitled ""Speak Memory.""Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. For more on movies go to boston.com/ae/ movies/blog. (c) Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company.

Reece Thompson and Anna Kendrick in ""Rocket Science"" Jeffrey Blitzs teen angst comedy opening Friday. Photo Jim Bridges Rocket Science Stutterer plots revenge (with words) 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Rocket Science Drama. Starring Reece Daniel Thompson Anna Kendrick Nicholas DAgosto and Vincent Piazza. Directed by Jeffrey Blitz. (R. 101 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Hal Hefner isnt troubled by physically abusive parents nerd-hating jocks or a town preacher who wants to ban dancing within the city limits. Hes living through an even worse high school hell roaming from home to class in near invisibility - gaining notice only when his stuttering provides amusement for his apathetic classmates. ""Rocket Science"" has the makings of either a tragedy or a crowd-pleasing underdog story but writer-director Jeffrey Blitz instead takes the movie on a different and ultimately more rewarding direction. At various times the movie seems to be a study of high school debating a treatise on love and a ""My Bodyguard""-style triumph by the weak over the strong. But every time Blitz settles on a conventional path his film takes a sharp U-turn back into harsh reality. Above all its a story about the role of vengeance in art and commerce. Has anyone ever doubted that the success of Bill Gates George Lucas Roger Ebert and Stephen King was fueled at least in part by thoughts of revenge against their high school tormenters? Blitz who directed the spelling bee documentary ""Spellbound"" seems to have serious issues concerning his own adolescence and hes working them out with this movie. How else to explain the amusing and often bizarrely accurate details in each main character played convincingly by a roster of excellent young actors? Reece Thompson is Hal a struggling runt of a student who might be hanging out with the smart kids if it werent for the stutter that keeps his quick wit from surfacing. Hal is not too far off from the Robert De Niro character in ""Awakenings."" His life is a walking coma as he struggles - and consistently fails - with tasks as simple as choosing pizza over fish in the school cafeteria. Hal is set free from his seclusion by the schools fast-talking top debater Ginny (Anna Kendrick) who sees something in him that can help her win the New Jersey state debating championships - which she would have taken the previous year if her brilliant partner (Nicholas DAgosto) didnt experience an epic meltdown. The resulting twists and turns are funny and almost always cruel. It might be a good idea to watch a few episodes of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" or the British version of ""The Office"" to get in the ""Rocket Science"" mind-set. This is a movie where the protagonist is made to suffer from beginning to end. Its important to know that going in because the story elements that make ""Rocket Science"" unique will also be frustrating for moviegoers who prefer tidy endings. Throughout the movie Blitz constantly nudges his audience in the direction of an inspirational crowd-pleaser story only to yell ""Psyche"" right before a pivotal scene. (Imagine if E.T. got a fatal illness from Reeses Pieces or if ""Rocky"" ended with the Italian Stallion falling in the bathtub and forfeiting the big fight.) As for this movies finish think what would have happened if John Sayles not John Hughes had written the final 20 minutes of ""Sixteen Candles."" But even when Blitz strays from his apparent mission the characters all hit their mark thanks to a script that never fails to present an unexpected scenario - usually accompanied by a moment or two of hilarity. The supporting characters have a ""Napoleon Dynamite"" quality that suggests an alternative reality whether youre watching Hals sociopathic brother or the conservative-looking older couple who practice the Kama Sutra and play Violent Femmes duets on the cello and piano. There are also scenes that might remind you of ""Garden State"" and particularly Alexander Paynes ""Election."" Ultimately though comparisons to other movies are kind of pointless with ""Rocket Science."" This is Blitzs unique creation and it will be exciting to see what he comes up with next. -- Advisory ""Rocket Science"" contains profanity mild sexual content and disturbing images of extremely unappetizing cafeteria food.

Friday August 10 2007 400 AM Rocket Science. Comedy-drama about a stuttering high-school boy trying out for the debate team. With Reece Thompson Anna Kendrick. Writer-director Jeffrey Blitz (148). R Language sexual content. At AMC Empire Landmark Sunshine. Jeffrey Blitzs first film was ""Spellbound"" a superb documentary following contestants in the 1999 National Spelling Bee. With ""Rocket Science"" he switches from nonfiction to fiction and from spelling contests to high-school debate. The result is equally captivating. ""Rocket Science"" follows the verbal and romantic struggles of Hal Hefner a rail-thin New Jersey teen with a stuttering problem so bad that by the time he can say the word ""pizza"" the cafeteria waitress has slapped some Sloppy Joe on his plate. Hal has other problems including a bullying older brother who addresses him by various female names parents who hate each other and a social cluelessness that has him hauling his schoolbooks around in a wheeled carry-on bag. But as played by Reece Thompson Hal is as likable a suburban kid as Beaver Cleaver and when his schools debate queen Ginny Ryerson (Anna Kendrick) improbably picks him as her new debate partner his frustration is offset by infatuation. ""Rocket Science"" is a quirky comedy-drama that gets the bulk of its humor from the well-placed non sequitur. It never seems to be going where you think it is and that includes its oddly endearing dialogue. The story is essentially one school year of preparation for the annual city debate tournament. Ginny had last years championship locked up until her partner froze in the finals. Now shes taking no chances handpicking a student she says she can mold into a debating machine. Hal is happy to accommodate though the only way he can debate without stuttering is to memorize his speech and sing it to the tune of ""The Battle Hymn of the Republic."" The real attraction for him is Ginny and his enthusiasm for this years debate theme - resolved Abstinence from sex is bad. One of the films offbeat treats is the juxtaposition of Hals stammering speech with the rapid-fire debating of Ginny and former partner Ben (Nicholas DAgosto). Hefners stutter is remarkably consistent but for level of difficulty Kendrick and DAgosto get higher marks.

August 10 2007 Save for later Saved New in theaters Rocket Science (R)Director Jeffrey Blitz. With Reece Daniel Anna Kendrick. (101 min.)Jeffrey Blitz who made his feature directorial debut with the acclaimed documentary ""Spellbound"" tries out his fiction chops in ""Rocket Science"" with mixed results. High-schooler Hal Hefner (Reece Daniel) is a stutterer who is dragooned into joining the debate team by the teams star member Ginny (Anna Kendrick). Hal is as geeky as Ginny is princessy and to its credit the movie doesnt try to turn them into Romeo and Juliet. Blitz captures high school atmosphere well - not an easy thing to do - but overall the movie coasts on quirkiness. Grade B - Peter Rainer Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? 2 Days in Paris (R) Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Director Julie Delpy. With Julie Delpy Adam Goldberg . (96 min.) Actress Julie Delpy both wrote and directed ""2 Days in Paris"" which is like an amiable knock-off of ""Before Sunrise"" and ""Before Sunset"" the two films she made opposite Ethan Hawke for director Richard Linklater. She plays a French photographer who is with her American interior designer boyfriend (Adam Goldberg) as they play out the last gasp of their relationship on a European vacation. Much of their nattery byplay seems improvised and the results are very hit and miss - inspired contretemps alternate with gabfests that seem to go on forever. Grade B - P.R.Bratz (PG)Director Sean McNamara. With Nathalia Ramos Skyler Shaye. (110 min.) Four ""best friends forever"" start high school expecting to be trendsetters but the egomaniacal and seemingly permanent student president quickly assigns them to separate social groups. Eventually they rebel determined to unite the campus in love. A lofty goal certainly but this film plays like an overproduced music video swamping message and talent alike. Grade C-- M.K. TerrellSex/nudity 3 mild instances of innuendo. Violence 2 slapstick scenes. Profanity 9 mild expressions. Cigarettes/drugs/alcohol none.Daddy Day Camp (PG)Director Fred Savage. With Cuba Gooding Jr. Paul Rae. (93 min.) Buoyed by their success at running a child-care center househusbands Charlie Hinton and Phil Ryerson (Cuba Gooding Jr. Paul Rae) decide to start a camp. Of course everything that can go wrong does. The movie on the other hand gets better as it goes along. The ""Olympiad"" contest with a neighboring camp is fun not to say original. This kinder and gentler sequel features the main characters from ""Daddy Day Care"" but with a different cast. Grade C-- M.K.T.Sex/nudity 1 mild instance of innuendo.

The movie set in Plainsboro N.J. is too hip to ask you to feel sorry for Hal Hefner (Reece Daniel Thompson) a gawky floppy-haired high school stutterer. Yet it never explores his psychology or anguish. His stuttering is presented as the behavioral equivalent of a dysfunctional halo -- a trait that confers outsider status and the ""innocence"" that goes with it. The director Jeffrey Blitz who made the acclaimed documentary Spellbound (and who has discussed growing up as a stutterer himself) doesnt trust the audience to respond to the situations he creates. He turns everything into a glib indie commercial from the speech pathologist who tells Hal ""Its really a shame youre not hyperactive"" to the brainiac Ginny (Anna Kendrick) who speaks in mile-a-minute sentences and pushes him onto the debate team. Why filter such a personal story through the attitudinal tics of Wes Anderson and Napoleon Dynamite especially if youre going to do it with about one-third the skill? Nothing in Rocket Science quite parses. Ginny the verbal genius starts out with a crush on Hal (we can see why she might prefer a quiet boy) but then she takes a hostile turn that isnt remotely explained. And Thompson who has a winning presence isnt asked to show any anger -- a glaring omission in a story of adolescent pain. Rocket Science is a movie that never quite spits out what it has to say.

"Rocket Science | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; rocket-science ) Rocket Science (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli Rocket Science is the feature debut of director Jeffrey Blitz whose previous big-screen exposure was with the documentary Spellbound. In that one Blitz looked at the highly competitive world of spelling bees. In this one he places his fictional characters in the equally highly competitive world of debating. The narrative is framed as a traditional ""overachieving underdog"" story but it plays out more as an offbeat drama than a ""Rocky behind a podium"" type of movie. The problem with Rocket Science is that the character at the center of the drama isnt very energetic or truth be told interesting. This makes it difficult at times to remain engaged in the unfolding tale. Hal Hefner (Reece Thompson) is living out his life as a teenager in Plainsboro New Jersey. He is almost friendless at school his father has left home and his brother Earl (Vincent Piazza) delights in tormenting him. To make matters worse Hal suffers from a speech disorder. He can form the words in his mind but they dont come out of his mouth properly. His stuttering has made him a social misfit until the captain of the debating team Ginny (Anna Kendrick) sees something in Hal that no one else sees. Having lost the top trophy the previous year when her partner Ben (Nicholas DAgosto) lost his ability to argue at a critical time Ginny is determined to achieve victory this year. In Hal she sees someone with the raw talent to be amazing - or so she says. It turns out that her motives arent straightforward and the ever-trusting Hal is poised for a fall. One could argue that Rocket Science chooses to focus on the wrong character. We are given enough of a glimpse into Ginnys personality to recognize how fascinating and magnetic she is a whip-smart angel-faced young woman who will use all her charms to get what she wants. Shes a lot more interesting than Hal who is the kind of guy we have seen in countless similar feel-good motion pictures. Its a shame because a movie about Ginny might have been fresh and unusual while the one about Hal is no better than diverting. Hal doesnt hold our attention the way Ginny does; its no surprise that the movie is at its best when shes on screen. And the longer shes away the more energy it loses. This isnt intended to be a negative reflection on the ability of actor Reece Thompson who does a good job bringing out Hals awkwardness. Its the character not the actor whos at fault. Thompson can hold his own opposite stage-turned-screen performer Anna Kendrick but Hal cant hold his own opposite Ginny. On a high level Rocket Science is re-telling Lucas with strong Napoleon Dynamite overtones. The Lucas plotline of a boy extending beyond his reach as a result of unrequited love provides the overall template of Rocket Science although the female lead here is a less benevolent presence and the male lead would fit nicely into Mr. Dynamites posse. He is intelligent but socially inept. (This differentiates him from the characters in Eagle vs. Shark where the protagonists are just plain stupid.) The point of the movie which is saddled with a long-winded and unfortunate voiceover is not for Hal to stun the New Jersey debating world with an improbable victory but to show that theres more to this boy than someone who sits in the corner and stutters as the world passes him by. This is about how Hal finds his voice. Although Rocket Science is primarily dramatic in nature there are numerous quirky quasi-comedic scenes that may provoke wry smiles and a few good natured chuckles. Blitz wants us to take his motion picture seriously but not too seriously. Its just too bad there isnt more of Ginny and less of Hal but thats not the movie Blitz made. Rocket Science is moderately uplifting but not especially memorable.

But in Jeffrey Blitzs smartly comic Rocket Science the painful predicament of high schooler Hal Hefner (Reece Thompson) becomes something more - a poignant absurdist take on adolescent angst suburban dysphoria and first love. Yes there are echoes of other films - the misfit youth in Thumbsucker the recent U.K. coming-of-age entry Starter for 10 and the deadpan left-of-center goofiness of Wes Anderson - but Rocket Science has a voice and tone of its own. Blitz whose Oscar-nominated 2002 spelling-bee documentary Spellbound detailed the intense pressures parents put on their kids (and that kids put on themselves) shows real compassion for the awkward agonizing rites and rituals of teendom. But his film is refreshingly free of sap - theres irony here and a healthy disdain for the too-neat Hollywood resolution. Hal a quick kid from a dysfunctional family (with a brow-beating weirdo older brother) knows who he is and what he wants but he quite literally cant get the words out. (His mom who has her own issues is nicely played by Philadelphias Lisbeth Bartlett.) But then the mega-assured Ginny Ryerson (Anna Kendrick) star of the school debate team takes an interest in Hal encouraging him to join her on the dais as they tackle issues from farm subsidies to sexual abstinence. Ginny can see she says the insight and intellect locked in Hals head waiting to get out. Understandably smitten Hal throws himself into training sessions at Ginnys house. He befriends her gawky next-door neighbor - a skinny kid (think Pee-wee Herman at 12) with sex on the brain who spies on Ginny from his window. Although it was actually shot in and around Baltimore (tax credits more relaxed child labor laws) Blitzs nifty oddball story is set in beautiful bucolic Plainsboro N.J. Theres a wonderful interlude in Trenton too which represents in the mind of one key character the be-all of the urban experience. The soundtrack boasts plaintive stuff from Eef Barzelay of the unsung indie band Clem Snide. (His music functions in Rocket Science similarly to the way the Shins limned another Jersey tale Garden State.) Rocket Science captures the melancholy the rage the hurt and drama of adolescence without pandering or condescending. Blitz and his team have crafted a real grown-up little film all the more so for the winning performances hes elicited from his not-so-grown-up stars. Rocket Science  (out of four stars) Written and directed by Jeffrey Blitz. With Reece Thompson Anna Kendrick Nicholas DAgosto Vincent Piazza Lisbeth Bartlett and Aaron Yoo.

This unusually voluble comedy is as eloquent about love self-realization and adolescent angst. Writer-director Jeffrey Blitz segues effortlessly from nonfiction to fiction -- and from spelling bees to speech tournaments -- in ""Rocket Science"" a disarmingly quirky follow-up to his Oscar-nominated (and Sundance-rejected) doc ""Spellbound."" Following a stuttering insecure youth who joins the debate team after falling hard for a brainy female classmate this unusually voluble comedy is as eloquent about love self-realization and adolescent angst as its protagonist is endearingly tongue-tied. Theres room for debate but by playing up the pics geeky comic sensibility and Blitzs hit pedigree Picturehouse just might have a winner on its hands. ""Rocket Science"" has a few things in common with 1999s ""Election"" from its purposefully drab visuals to its larger-than-life personalities -- all variations on recognizable high-school types albeit a hundred times brighter better-spoken and more interesting. But Blitzs film is ultimately a sweeter more heartfelt picture. Its more a barbed coming-of-age tale than satire and firmly on the side of its lovably awkward hero Hal Hefner (wonderfully played by Reece Daniel Thompson). Smartly scripted prologue suggests a metaphysical (or perhaps metalingual) connection between Ben Wekselbaum (Nicholas DAgosto) a brilliant policy debater at New Jerseys Plainsboro High School and Hal a quiet teen who whenever he speaks does so with a pronounced stutter. During an important debate Ben suddenly halts midspeech and loses the championship trophy; miles away Hal watches as his dad (Denis OHare) has a nasty altercation with his mom (Lisbeth Bartlett) packs a suitcase and walks out of the house. Cheekily suggesting the gift of rhetoric can be transferred from one soul to another the pic proceeds to dig deep inside Hal exposing the near-daily humiliations that have gutted his self-esteem. His speech impediment makes even a trip through the lunch line difficult and his older brother Earl (a hilariously macho Vincent Piazza) beats up on him constantly often by launching ""Psycho""-style attacks on Hal in the shower. Enter Ginny Ryerson (Anna Kendrick) Bens former debate partner whos determined not to repeat her disastrous defeat this year. A close cousin of ""Elections"" Tracy Flick and a better speaker to boot Ginny is bossy beautiful and freakishly competitive. She also claims to see something in Hal that others dont and urges him to join the debate squad under her tutelage. Thoroughly smitten Hal agrees. Pic would be worth watching just for its scenes of debaters practicing the art of ""spreading"" -- a rapid-fire delivery technique that would give the characters in ""His Girl Friday"" pause and which DAgosto and Kendrick have got down cold.. But sharp dialogue and wacky non sequiturs aside the deep pleasure of ""Rocket Science"" is the way it resists easy classification. Pic unexpectedly deepens into a poignant and amusing reflection on the universal nature of love as Hal realizes everyone is getting it on -- from his mom and her new boyfriend (Stephen Park) to a musician couple who play erotic duets down the street. Yet just when it seems the story is going to settle into a conventional teen romance -- as Hal and Ginny begin making out in earnest and the competition approaches -- Blitz throws in a hairpin twist that forces a drastic reassessment of his intentions. Given its ideas about the importance of defying expectations and taking charge of ones destiny the comedys mercurial nature turns out to be entirely appropriate. If theres a link between ""Rocket Science"" and ""Spellbound"" its Blitzs terrific ability to embrace peoples idiosyncrasies real or fictitious even as he tweaks them for maximum comic effect. This time he also brings to the podium a formidable skill with actors. In an unusually demanding role for a young thesp Thompson not only makes an appealingly gawky protag but crucially nails the trademark stutter that no less than the movie itself is one-of-a-kind. Other standouts in the strong ensemble include DAgosto and especially Kendrick who bring a fierce meticulous concentration to bear on their delightfully cocky performances as Type A overachievers. The dingy underlit quality of Jo Willems lensing perfectly complements the mundane New Jersey locations (with some stand-in work from Baltimore). Eef Barzelays impressively multifaceted score incorporates ukulele tuba accordion cello banjo and kazoo music into a folksy-percussive whole while the similarly diverse soundtrack makes memorable use of ""The Battle Hymn of the Republic"" among other tunes.
