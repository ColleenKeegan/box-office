Rather than a web of intrigue ""Along Came a Spider"" weaves a humdrum plot thats never ahead of the audience until three-quarters through and even then will hardly surprise the readers of James Pattersons first bestselling novel featuring uber-profiler Alex Cross. A prequel to ""Kiss the Girls"" -- the first Cross thriller adapted for the screen also starring Morgan Freeman -- new pic thankfully steers clear of its predecessors glumly lurid obsessions while remaining focused on the abduction of a young female innocent. Yet the very characteristics that have made Cross so appealing particularly his mind-tickling abilities to assess and outmaneuver his criminal opponents are reduced here to the most fundamental and predictable level. First-week curiosity will quickly fade leading to an unexciting theatrical return for a Paramount release that will have to recoup in a big way in ancillaries. While Pattersons fans will have to refrain from revealing the storys key twist they may not recognize other elements that screenwriter Marc Moss changed in his adaptation. Script pares away considerable action and complications while altering the identities of the victims and the spellings of character names. A new ending was reshot late into production but may not have been a vast improvement on any previous variations of ""Spider."" The conclusion is all of a piece with the rather plodding whole helmed by Kiwi director Lee Tamahori whose third Hollywood feature continues a string of disappointments after his first work the bracing ""Once Were Warriors."" Though the opening moments shrewdly avoid the temptation to reintroduce Freemans familiar Cross they are nevertheless as generic as can be. This thinking detective puts his partner in a dangerous situation with a serial killer and like Sylvester Stallones character in ""Cliffhanger"" watches her tumble to an awful precipitous death. Months later the self-doubting Cross burrows inside himself by building model ships but a kidnapping is brewing to bring him back into the hunt. At a tony D.C. private school a teacher named Gary Soneji (Michael Wincott) whose bad W.C. Fields-like makeup disguise alone should make him extremely suspicious to authorities teaches a class on Charles Lindbergh and has his eye on two prized pupils Megan Rose (Mika Boorem) daughter of Sen. Hank Rose (Michael Moriarty) and Dimitri Starodubov (Anton Yelchin) son of the Russian ambassador to the U.S. Soneji gets Megan alone in his office and quickly subdues her and drives her to his waiting yacht. Chided for letting the kidnapping happen on her watch Secret Service agent Jezzie Flannigan (Monica Potter) seems to be in the permanent doghouse with top cop Ollie McArthur (Dylan Baker). But Cross drawn into the case by some evidence and a phone call care of Soneji insists that Jezzie be part of the investigative team setting up a frustratingly uninteresting relationship between them. Their supposed links -- a passion for rescuing Megan a gnawing sense of professional failure -- feel more like genre requirements than authentic elements of their characters. As for Soneji it hardly gooses our sense of terror that hes such a blank bad guy Hes smart and -- Cross notes admiringly at one point -- as determined and methodical as a spider and hell kill anyone who gets in his way. But he has no real eccentricities or oddities to make him an interesting nemesis. The kidnappers unremarkable motive is to bring media attention to himself which makes Soneji no more compelling than a contestant on ""Survivor."" A thoroughly odd and unconvincing meeting between Cross and Soneji leads to the kidnappers awkwardly realized death scene. The twists that follow have enough of an impact to force auds to reconsider everything theyve heard and seen to this point -- a double-edged sword as it also leads to consideration of the gaping holes in the plot turn itself. As reliable as any actor in Hollywood Freeman delivers the requisite gravitas but the bland script curtails any personal touches he might have inserted were his sleuth character unraveling a truly vexing mystery. His co-stars notably lack fire from Wincott to the usually quietly dynamic Baker who must settle for cut-rate dialogue and brief scenes. Potter finally has some juicy opportunities late into the game but it is much too little too late. Pics visuals especially Matthew F. Leonettis anamorphic lensing have a fine sheen and though Jerry Goldsmiths score is not one of his more inspired its accented by an itchy nervousness of which the movie could have used more.

USATODAY.com - Spider crawls along without enough venom Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 04/06/2001 - Updated 0628 PM ET Spider crawls along without enough venom By Susan Wloszczyna USA TODAY Along Came a Spider (out of four) Stars Morgan Freeman Monica Potter Michael Wincott Director Lee Tamahori Distributor Paramount Pictures Rating R for violence and language Its a situation similar to ones youve seen before. Many times before. A Washington D.C. cop still smarting after the on-the-job death of his partner is the recipient of a key piece of evidence after a senators 12-year-old daughter is snatched from her heavily guarded prep school. His involvement in the federal case as well as his keen insight into the criminal mind upsets the government official in charge who responds with snarky resentment. But you havent seen this before. Instead of being the source of tension and competition for the rest of the movie the official actually apologizes to the local lawman and says he doesnt want any turf wars. Somewhere Miss Manners is applauding. Somewhere an audience member is yawning. Along Came a Spider must be one of the most polite big-screen mystery thrillers since Agatha Christies heyday. Its genteel nature at least suits the stately Morgan Freeman as he reprises his role as writer psychologist detective and all-around nice guy Dr. Alex Cross from 1997s Kiss the Girls based on James Pattersons novels. Yes a few people are shot and killed. But most never bother to introduce themselves. Such inconsideration can cost you in a movie like this. The no-names are the first to go. Not many puzzlers are kind enough to creep at a turtles pace so that those who consider the cutting-edge likes of Memento a mental torture chamber can guess the double-twisty ending and feel smugly proud of themselves. The only danger of a racing pulse is when Freeman involved in a ransom drop is sent on a breathless if pointless chase to different tourist sites in the nations capital. Even the gee-whiz tech tools arent about to flummox anyone. When Freeman uses a computer to maneuver through a room on a quest for a missing picture it looks for all the world as if hes playing an online game of Clue. A kid-in-peril situation is never pleasant. But at least this kidnapper (creepy yet subdued Michael Wincott) offers his hostage fresh clothes bathroom breaks and cups of hot tea with honey. When the resourceful girl (Mika Boorem a mighty mite among dullard adults) tries to make a break for it he hardly raises his voice. The guy is not a child abuser or a sexual sicko just a victim of parental neglect who wants Cross to make sure his masterful scheme is treated with due respect in the media. Cross and fellow senior sleuth Jessica Fletcher would surely get along like gangbusters but Freemans partner is Monica Potter (Patch Adams) who has suffered her own work-related disgrace as the Secret Service agent in charge of security at the school. Shes a pretty woman in the Julia Roberts mode but blond and bland as vanilla pudding. Director Lee Tamahori and writer Marc Moss attempt to tangle their web but leave too many holes and rely on some poorly strung coincidences. Throughout the action or inaction Freeman strides with noble authority making the derivative tale seem more intriguing than it is. Like a paperback plucked from a counter at an airport Spider is an impulse buy of a film a time killer that will neither tax your brain nor challenge your memory. Its instantly devoured and quickly forgotten.

Handout Photo Morgan Freeman reprising his role of forensic consultant Alex Cross from ""Kiss the Girls"" is back on the case in ""Along Came a Spider."" Handout Photo Spider Weaves A Tangled Web / Freeman cant save messy mindless sequel 1 / 1 Back to Gallery ALONG CAME A SPIDER Starring Morgan Freeman Monica Potter. Directed by Lee Tamahori. (R. 95 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) At his age Morgan Freeman has missed his DC Comics moment. But why should that stop him from using X-ray vision to peer through the plot holes in ""Along Came a Spider""? Freeman is so instinctively thorough that he could have solved the case at the heart of this movie from the set of his previous one. Hes here anyway looking haggard but remaining aware that audiences have come to see him reprise his forensic consultant role from ""Kiss the Girls."" Taken from another of James Pattersons Alex Cross thrillers ""Spider"" pits Freemans profiler against a teacher named Soneji (Michael Wincott) who has nabbed a little girl from an elite school in the D.C. suburbs. Why shes been swiped is only loosely related to her being a senators daughter. Sonejis actually after a bigger fish -- the son of a Russian diplomat and the object of the girls preteen crush. Why the boy is so desirable remains a mystery. Cross is such a brilliant detective that he can tie up ends before we know theyre loose. Freeman speaks only in exposition. But Cross inner life is the same as his outer life Hes all case. NOT SO PERSONAL In ""Kiss the Girls"" Freemans Cross had a niece caught in a serial killers web. This time its not so personal. In ""Spiders"" opening minutes he sees a partner go flying off a bridge but the audience gets the impression from Freeman that this is a routine case for Cross. In fact were it any simpler Cross would have to sic Angela Lansbury on it. The movie is operating by rote. Another crypto-Euro baddie who loves talking on the phone another senators daughter held hostage a glut of overcoats and crooked loosened Windsor knots. Whats director Lee Tamahori going to do to make this an affair to remember? Sonejis deftness and compulsive efficiency are as hysterical as John Lithgows in any De Palma flick He knocks the girl out strangles an interrupting teacher and still has time to mend the prosthetic face the girl tore at. Soneji has a tougher time keeping his young hostage in his clutches. Either shes read a lot of ""Harriet the Spy"" or seen too much ""MacGyver."" Shes a whiz with homemade bombs. But beyond the B-movie excursions that dry up after the first 20 minutes ""Spider"" is a mess of motives left unclear and characters left dangling. Dylan Baker as an inferior sleuth goes wasted; Michael Moriarty and Penelope Ann Miller play the girls parents. Its unclear whether theyre more bereaved for the missing girl or their missing screen time. The film remains steadfastly addicted to Freeman who humors us by taking his sweet time solving the case -- so we can feel good about being three or four scenes ahead of him at times. In his defense hes busy giving Monica Potter remedial lessons in screen presence. She plays Jezzie the disgraced Secret Service agent on whose watch the girl vanished. All her lines are delivered as if shes just handed out a round of No. 2 pencils and will now begin explaining how to use them to fill in the blanks on some standardized test. Someone failed to tell her The character only dresses like a proctor. WHATS WITH THE FACE? Her characters not all that perceptive either. Didnt she or anyone at the school find Mr. Sonejis rubbery complexion odd? (That he taught computer science is just no longer an excuse in this day and age.) Cross offers Jezzie minitutorials in profiling and forensics (""An empty frame equals a missing picture"" etc.). And eventually theres a scene in which the two stand together examining a wall of key photos. Hes studying them. Shes doesnt seem sure that theyre right side up. But its not fair Freeman is downright oracular. Sonejis entire motive for embarking on this ridiculous spree is to get some couch time with Cross maybe even a chapter in his next book. By Freud he wants to be caught stealing. From a chase sequence at D.C.s Union Station eerily reminiscent of ""Hannibals"" to the Kim Novak blond in Potters hair Tamahori has a tough time wringing a drop of original suspense from any of this stuff. Even the major plot twist is inevitable -- and relentlessly bland. Cross probably saw it coming but why should he care? Advisory This film contains violence.

RELATED SITES By Paul ClintonCNN Reviewer (CNN) -- ""Along Came A Spider"" is billed as a ""psychological suspense thriller."" It may be chock-full of psychological elements but its neither suspenseful nor thrilling. Morgan Freeman again plays Alex Cross a Washington D.C. police detective and psychologist famous for profiling killers. ""Spider"" based on the first of a series of books by James Patterson that feature this D.C. cop is a prequel to ""Kiss The Girls"" (1997) which co-starred Ashley Judd. Freemans female sidekick this time around is Monica Potter in the thankless role of Secret Service Agent Jezzie Flannigan. They star in a ludicrous film that gets off to a hopelessly ludicrous start. Creepy teacher Michael Wincott plays Gary Soneji a teacher who works at a very exclusive private school in D.C. Hidden cameras and high security -- including that provided by the Secret Service -- guard the school since many of its students have high-profile and powerful parents. One Megan Rose (Mika Borrem) is the daughter of a United States senator (Michael Moriarty). Another is Megans best friend Dimitri Starobubov (Anton Yelchin) son of the Russian president. Why the Secret Service is involved with the protection of a senators child or the Russian presidents child is never explained. After meticulous planning Soneji kidnaps Megan from his school office. After all hes her teacher so getting her alone is no problem. But heres the twist For two years Soneji has worn a wig fake beard and heavy make-up over complicated foam rubber prostheses that have totally altered the way he really looks. Megan and her classmates have been looking at someone in costume day in and day out. The audience is expected to believe that none of his colleagues (never mind all the different law enforcement types everywhere) ever noticed anything This sociopath is running around wearing enough makeup to turn Brad Pitt into Frankenstein ... and nobody can tell? In what universe?

(Bruce Talamon/Paramount) Only in the world of crime and punishment that exists on celluloid and the printed page do detectives have what are known as ""nemeses."" (Think Sherlock Holmes and Professor Moriarty.) If not for the criminal mastermind - that brilliant knuckle-stroking psychopath who cant resist tormenting his pursuers with clues (not the accidental but the ingeniously deliberate variety) - the business of detective fiction would dry up faster than a dot-com. Out of the sturdy but well-worn mold of ""Seven"" ""The Bone Collector"" and myriad other contemporary films policiers comes ""Along Came a Spider"" a taut satisfying sequel of sorts to the 1997 hit ""Kiss the Girls."" (Technically ""Spider"" is a prequel since its based on the first book in James Pattersons series about D.C. police department forensic-psychologist-extraordinaire Alex Cross; ""Kiss"" was the second title in the series.) Once again gimlet-eyed Morgan Freeman fills Crosss gumshoes with distinction. As in the earlier film the cerebral sleuth matches wits here with an equally cerebral bad guy. Like the titular arachnid villain Gary Soneji (the raspy-voiced Michael Wincott) invites the policeman and best-selling author of books on criminal profiling into his web - by planting evidence in Crosss mailbox no less - not because he wants to get caught but because he wants to be as Cross surmises ""appreciated."" To that end Soneji kidnaps the 9-year-old daughter (Mika Boorem) of a U.S. senator (Michael Moriarty) hoping it would appear to be memorialized as the perpetrator of the new crime of the century. So far so good . . . and so familiar. What enriches ""Spider"" however is the thematic undercurrent of redemption that runs throughout it. Not only is Cross on some level trying to atone for an earlier police sting in which he was indirectly responsible for his partners death (shown in a brief hair-raising prologue) but in this current case he has decided to partner with - or mentor really - another damaged psyche. Playing Secret Service Agent Jezzie Flannigan a disgraced officer whose inattention to duty led to her young charges abduction Monica Potter fits the formula frequently seen in movies of this ilk Shes young and good-looking somewhat rash and idealistic; hes older and wiser a cynical father figure with just a hint of brooding sexuality. Unlike ""Kiss the Girls"" though which capitalized on the chemistry between Freeman and co-star Ashley Judd the new film is less character driven. If Potter and Freeman dont exactly snap crackle and pop however thats more than made up for by the unexpected torque of the script which as adapted by writer Marc Moss and directed by Lee ""Once Were Warriors"" Tamahori contains several rip-snorting good plot twists. No theyre not ""Sixth Sense"" good but they come in well-timed succession and like the films judicious but not sparing use of gunfire theyre needed to jolt the audience out of its complacency. After all we think we know whodunit from the start. Of course I have to be allowed the usual local critics quibbles with the Washington depicted on film. In a sequence unintentionally hilarious (at least to area audiences) Cross scurries around downtown D.C. on foot as he follows the kidnappers instructions for dropping off a ransom. During one leg of the increasingly Byzantine relay race as a barely winded Cross sprints from pay phone to pay phone hes shown jogging from the Watergate hotel to Capitol Hill in 14 minutes flat - a crosstown trip that would be no mean feat for a man half his age. But little matter. Freemans performance - one of laserlike perspicacity shining through eyes made narrow by a laconic been-there-done-that cool - is the films ramrod-true spine. As Cross he enlivens ""Spiders"" tired conventions even as the film stretches the gossamer threads of its story line up to but never beyond the breaking point. ""Along Came a Spider"" (R 103 minutes) - Contains obscenity a bit of sexually oriented dialogue numerous shooting deaths and a child in jeopardy.

Sanders Michael Wincott; Director Lee Tamahori; Author Marc Moss; Producer (group) David Brown Productions Paramount Pictures Phase 1 Productions Revelations Entertainment; Release Date Wide 04/06/2001; Runtime (in minutes) 103; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Paramount Pictures Posted April 13 2001 -- 1200 AM EDT Morgan Freeman is bored by men who shoot first and ask questions later. This is a compliment. Whether hes inhabiting the role of a hitman in Nurse Betty or of a lifer convict in The Shawshank Redemption the actor with his default expression of contemplative repose invests even the most active or violent of characters with thoughtfulness; then he shoots. Hes a compassionate conservatives action figure. By such standards the role of Dr. Alex Cross -- Washington D.C. police detective and psychologist and the cop who traps a predator in Along Came a Spider -- is a keeper. Indeed Freeman first fleshed out the hero of James Pattersons top-selling series of thrillers with fragmented nursery-rhyme titles four years ago in Kiss the Girls. And in strict Crossology Girls was actually a sequel to this the first of the Cross novels. But the reversed order hardly matters. Spider bears little resemblance to the book aside from the fact that the weblike story is an engagingly sticky trap of mind games and plot tricks as well as action and that the kidnapper is a brilliant psychopath (of course) named Gary Soneji (Michael Wincott with a voice like honeyed battery acid) who abducts the daughter of a U.S. senator out of a twisted obsession with the Lindbergh babys kidnapper. As in the book Cross partner on the case is a Secret Service agent named Jezzie Flannigan (Monica Potter with a voice like Julia Roberts in tight shoes). Many of the subplots and ancillary preoccupations of Pattersons book dont make it into the first produced screenplay of Marc Moss; among them is Cross regularly remarked-upon awareness of being an African-American deputy chief of detectives in a predominantly black city. But thats just as well for New Zealand director Lee Tamahori who has taken a while to find his artistic footing in Hollywood following his stunning 1994 homegrown debut Once Were Warriors. (In Mulholland Falls and to a lesser extent The Edge Tamahoris instinct for emotional sinew was obscured by the seduction of studio fat.) At any rate the tonic of directing episodes of The Sopranos appears to have been a good workout Along Came a Spider moves at a taut well-metered pace one that allows for scenes of psychological excavation -- as when Cross talks to an increasingly distraught Soneji by telephone -- as well as scenes of cranked-up action. At one point Cross must sprint to hell and back all over D.C. on a ransom drop omnisciently directed by the kidnapper who paces Cross via a series of calls placed to cell phones and amazingly to always working and available pay phones. Theres absolutely no reason to this teasing chase which doesnt withstand the scrutiny of logic and inevitably goes on two phone calls too long. But thats also what makes this thriller such broody fun. While Tamahori trains his camera on the ordinariness of the streets Morgan Freeman demonstrates hes capable extraordinarily of running and thinking at the same time.
