Comments (1) Takers Video Rated PG-13  107 minutes  2010 Matt Dillon gets top billing as a dedicated blue-collar cop but he doesnt have a fighting chance for the audiences sympathy opposite suave Idris Elba playing the leader of an upscale gang of LA thieves. Also vying for the alpha male slot in this dopey urban exploitation film and even more street than Elba is rapper Tip ""T.I."" Harris as an ex-con whos taken the fall for one of the gangs heists but still invites them to join him in a big new score. Paul Walker is window dressing as the resourceful wheel-man; the hotshot du jour is Chris Brown (This Christmas) who bounces off of a succession of moving vehicles and plunges through glass with nary a scratch. Laughable subplots about Elbas addicted sister (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) and Dillons crooked partner (Jay Hernandez) only slow the action which is all this movie has going for it.

Beyond that it falls into the trap of having so many characters theres no room for them all to register so while Matt Dillons cop is mildly world-weary on the criminal side some gangsters get more fulsome problems than others. Thus commanding Idris Elba has a junkie sister and their ex-con former associate TI puts together a dubious security-van job to kick the plot into gear but Hayden Christensen contents himself with an annoying hat and Paul Walker a scowl. Its hard to give two hoots about any of this lot but at least the action exudes enough professionalism to give us something to look forward to. Not terrible but undemanding.

Matt Dillon is the fuzz on their tail a grizzled obsessive in love with his job and neglectful of his family. The crooks slo-mo power-walk away from an exploding helicopter puts the likelihood of their capture into perspective Jurisprudence takes a holiday when thievery looks this damn good. But the gum in the works is ex-con Ghost (hip-hop artist T.I.) who brings tidings to Elba and crew of an armored car stickup to end em all. Its obvious that the dung will eventually pelt the spinning blades; in terms of plot Takers is as derivative as a direct-to-video quickie. Yet for all its faux Michael Mann--isms (ooh that sharp-edged L.A. architecture) the film is still rather enthralling. Director John Luessenhops aggressive approach to action scenes is frequently inspired especially the parkour-peppered foot chase between Dillon fellow flatfoot Jay Hernandez and yard-stomping criminal Chris Brown. And the casting from lead roles to supporting is uniformly terrific Its a particular pleasure to see the underutilized Marianne Jean-Baptiste (of Mike Leighs Secrets amp; Lies) steal scenes as Elbas drug-addict sis.---Keith Uhlich Watch the trailer More new Film reviews Posted Monday August 23 2010 Details Release details Cast and crew Users say LiveReviews|02 people listeningSign inWrite reviewMost helpfulMost helpfulHighest ratingLowest ratingNewestOldestLoadingundefinedNew CommentsRefreshShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Website terms of use Contact us Get listed Advertising Time Out products Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Foursquare Time Out New York Site map },http://www.timeout.com/newyork/articles/film/88574/takers,200,takers3,takers,timeout

Harris Michael Ealy Watch Clips Thats The Past Notes Dev note migrated from resource_media Ready To Rock Notes Dev note migrated from resource_media Hes Headed Through The Park Notes Dev note migrated from resource_media The Wire really ruined things for cops-and-robbers cinema. Back in the 80s Hollywood could still make a movie like Takers counting on some audiences to buy into its slick quasi-operatic take on suave sexy criminals and the gruff hard-boiled officers obsessed with bringing them down. Now audiences are savvy enough to realize that extended shootouts on crowded city streets arent really a typical day of police work. Of course The Wire wasnt the only cop show in the past decade to debunk the 80s glamorization of police and thieves but its relevant here because Takers features two cast members from that show -- Idris Elba in the lead plus Glynn Turman in a smaller role -- and theyre constant reminders of just what kind of crime fiction this isnt. Elba plays (as he did on television) a cool calculating criminal in this case the leader of a crew of heist artists possessed of a creativity and a surgical precision that would make the Oceans 11 gang envious. And as a heist picture Takers doesnt stray far from formula. Ghost (rapper T.I.) gets out of jail the day after his former crew hits a bank for more than 2 million and comes to them for money they owe him from years before -- and to lay in their lap the promise of an even bigger score. Its not quite the ""one last job"" typical of the genre but it fits the mold. Theyre being tracked by the standard-issue obsessive cop a hardened lawman who lives and breathes the job so oblivious to life outside his work that he spends his day off trailing a suspect with his daughter in tow. Matt Dillon phones in the role seemingly hoping that a raspy tough-guy growl will suggest a depth of character lacking in the script. Hes not alone. Director John Luessenhop doesnt challenge anyone in the cast to do much acting; Elba does what he can with the material but the worst of the bunch -- Paul Walker and Hayden Christensen wooden performers even on many of their best days -- seem like theyre reading lines for the first time. Thats problematic for the films emotional subplots of which there are far too many. Personal dramas away from the heist are an essential part of these movies They provide the distractions that make for sloppy execution and the potential for disaster and they create an otherwise unlikely rooting interest in unsavory crooks. Luessenhop and his three co-writers hedge their bets by giving many of their characters half-baked personal crises but with no heft to the performances its hard to care whether anyones dreams are dashed or fulfilled. i On The Prowl Matt Dillon plays that heist-movie fixture a cop determined to track down the superslick culprits once and for all. Suzanne Tenner/Screen Gems Inc. hide caption toggle caption Suzanne Tenner/Screen Gems Inc. On The Prowl Matt Dillon plays that heist-movie fixture a cop determined to track down the superslick culprits once and for all. Suzanne Tenner/Screen Gems Inc. That leaves the heist itself to compensate but it only digs deeper into action movie cliches. Theres the obligatory chase sequence a frenetically edited shaky-cam set piece in which beleaguered singer Chris Brown gets to sprint across the tops of cars. There are double-crosses point-blank shootouts between warring criminals and a Mexican standoff. And just in case you havent had enough of that hoariest of shoot-em-up images one character even fires a gun while diving sideways. In slow motion. While soulful swelling strings underline the poignancy of the gunplay. Takers might have been cutting edge in 1985. But in 2010 after these images have been endlessly spoofed and rendered obsolete by more sophisticated takes on the material its little more than a humorless throwback that was never let in on the joke.

After sitting through Takers with my stomach rearranged by hyperactive camera spazzing I hereby formally request all directors and cinematographers to just get a grip already and STOP. WIGGLING. THE CAMERA. Im not insisting that no one should employ the wobbly hand-held approach under any circumstances ever -- it has its place in documentaries first-person horror and small Danish movies - but I am suggesting rather vehemently that any filmmaker who considers going jiggly should first sit down and watch Fritz Langs M and then decide whether scrambling the audiences visual field is truly the best approach to telling a story. Even in an action movie. Especially in an action movie Paul Greengrass this means you. Maybe its me but I thought the point of watching fistfights chases and shoot-outs was to actually see the fistfights chases and shootouts. If I were only interested in hearing them Id sit in the theater with a bag over my head. Take Takers. Its a mindless hyper-stylized heist movie but the mindlessness is inoffensive and the stylishness is slammin. I count myself among the worlds many film goers content to watch hip dudes make plans wear suits and smirk especially if there are explosives in the offing and a grinding dance beat underneath it. The dudes in this case are a gang of sleek L.A. robbers who do high-class high-yield work and then retreat to a penthouse for drinks. They include Hayden Christensen in a porkpie hat; Idris Elba as an earnest English ringleader with a crackhead sister (Marianne Jean-Baptiste); Michael Ealy and Chris Brown (yep that Chris Brown) as a pair of smart and dingbat brothers respectively; and Paul Walker doing what he does best namely glaring with purpose. When an old gang member played by Tip ""T.I."" Harris (yep that T.I.) shows up fresh out of prison he wants them to jack an armored car carrying 25 or 30 million bucks. After a brief discussion of pros and cons Elbas character arrives at this razor-sharp conclusion ""Were takers gents. Thats what we do for a living. We take."" The movie thus consists of the gents making plans and wearing suits and smirking all while a tough-guy copper sniffs around the edges. Hes played by Matt Dillon last seen boosting his very own truck in Armored. As you can see theres some potential here for inane fun. But director/co-writer John Luessenhop (Lockdown) and his cohorts (cinematographer Michael Barrett editor Armen Minasian) go overboard with the mega-zoom close-ups quick edits herky-jerk camera work and other visual chaos. The action sequences suffer the most. Brown seems bewildered by his dialogue but he gets to scramble over walls and cars in an energetic bit of parkour that I desperately wanted to follow. So I put it to you If somethings worth seeing isnt it worth seeing clearly? And if a film is worth shooting isnt it worth shooting well? amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Gillette Silver Blue Razor Blades 100-Pack for 14 + free...

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Aug. 27 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 312PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Takers Directed by John Luessenhop Written by Peter Allen Gabriel Casseus John Luessenhop and Avery Duff Starring Matt Dillon Idris Elba and Jay Hernandez Classification 14A Rating Two stars Sneaking into the last weekend of the summer with not much to sell itself beyond the presence of a couple of crossover music stars in the cast (rapper Tip ""T.I."" Harris and singer Chris Brown) the new heist movie Takers is surprisingly okay. Once you get past the recycled quality of the characters and dialogue the movie has some stylish action sequences and moderately clever plot turns that rival anything in the more high-profile summer noisemakers The Losers The Expendables and The A-Team. Director John Luessenhop making only his second feature (his first Lockdown debuted a decade ago) proves an astute thief himself with sequences that pay homage to the anxious crime operas of Michael Mann (especially Heat) and balletic shootouts of John Woo films. Takers begins with a bank robbery thats executed by five slick thieves who use disguises technology and ingenuity to plan their exit. The gang - a mixture of street thugs and educated strategists - is led by glowering Gordon (The Wires Idris Elba using his real British accent) brothers Jake and Jesse (Michael Ealy and Chris Brown) partner John (Paul Walker) and strategist A.J. (Hayden Christensen). Post-robbery they dress in Italian suits hang around tony bars sip champagne and talk offshore investments to show us how gentlemen robbers might live. Faintly on their trail are a couple of working-stiff L.A. detectives a bundle of bad temper named Welles (Matt Dillon) and his easy-going partner Eddie (Jay Hernandez). The odds of the cops out-smarting the crooks are long until the gang makes an uncharacteristically rash move. A former colleague Ghost (T.I. exuding a one-note cocky attitude) has just come out of jail with a plan for an armoured-car heist. The other gang members are doubtful Ghost is unpredictable there are some scruffy Russians involved and nobody really needs more money. But as Gordon points out in a line that justifies the title ""Were takers. Thats what we do."" Thats the long set-up for a fairly clever cat-and-mouse game a big explosion in downtown traffic some intricate indoor gun battles and an impressive foot-race through downtown L.A. all of which adds up to about 40 minutes of decent action filmmaking. The rest of the movie consists of hackneyed domestic-drama filler. Zoe Saldana (Star Trek Avatar) gets short shrift as the potential love interest of two members of the gang and Oscar-winner Marianne Jean-Baptiste in compensation for the testosterone overkill does some disconcertingly out-of-place acting as another gangsters drug-addicted sister. On the cop side its all about the kids Eddie who has a son who needs a new kidney warns Welles to stop neglecting his young daughter and start taking care of the ""real stuff."" Of course the ""real stuff"" for the young male action-movie audience is death and glory muscles and bullets car chases and big slow-motion kabooms - the rest is hamburger helper. Given the final body count of Takers a sequel would be a challenge but reportedly a prequel is in the works.

They are in and out like clockwork leaving no evidence behind and laying low in between heists. But when they attempt to pull off one last job with more money at stake than ever before the crew may find their plans interrupted by a hardened detective who is hell-bent on solving the case. Starring Matt Dillon Paul Walker Idris Elba Jay Hernandez Tip ""T.I."" Harris Michael Ealy Chris Brown Hayden Christensen Zoe Saldana Johnathon Schaech Director John Luessenhop Running time 147 Release Opened Aug 27 2010  Editorial Review Bang-bang story needs more heatBy John AndersonFriday August 27 2010Its not quite clear during the opening moments of the gun-crazy chase-happy ""Takers"" whether director John Luessenhop is trying to reinvent the heist movie or searching for the Holy Grail -- i.e. a hetero-male version of ""Sex and the City"" luxurious clothes hipster cars fat cigars big guns (of course) women as drapery -- you know all the cool stuff shot like porn. But after its brief attempt at being a homicidal ""Entourage"" ""Takers"" eventually settles into a caper-flick groove largely because it takes its cues from some far superior films namely ""Oceans 11/12/13"" and Michael Manns ""Heat."" Like the George Clooney/Brad Pitt crime comedies ""Takers"" assembles a group of suave handsome vaguely funny and chronically dysfunctional criminals who join forces to make a big killing. Like ""Heat"" it begins with one crime a bank robbery and builds up to another the seizing of an armored car carrying 30 million which will be accomplished by blowing up an entire Los Angeles intersection. In between the movie puts its equally sympathetic cops and robbers in parallel motion toward a cataclysmic collision but not before making them Real Human Beings. Everybody has personal problems. Gang leader Gordon (the supremely charismatic Idris Elba) has to choreograph the big score while trying to keep his reprobate sister (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) in rehab. Hes also trying to dismiss some nagging doubts about Ghost (rapper T.I.) a former member of the robbery gang who took the rap before served six years in prison and is back carrying an outsize chip on his shoulder. On the other side of the criminal-justice aisle Detective Jack Welles (Matt Dillon) neglects his young daughter while obsessively trying to piece together a mosaic of clues that dont quite seem to connect Gordon to the gun-toting Jake (Michael Ealy) or the strategist Johnny (Paul Walker) or the useless Jesse (Chris Brown) or Rat-Pack wannabe A.J. (Hayden Christensen) or any of them to the bank robbery that opened the movie. Meanwhile Jacks partner Eddie (Jay Hernandez) is being scrutinized by Internal Affairs; Ghost is simmering because his old girlfriend Rachel (Zoe Saldana) has taken up with Jake. The Russian mobsters who provided Ghost with the info on the armored car are saying nyet nyet nyet. The whole thing is a soap opera but with much bigger bullets. Fortunately the melodramatic aspects of ""Takers"" (""Were all takers"" murmurs Gordon. ""Its what we do."") are good because otherwise the movie would be pure muddle. Luessenhop and his antic camera are after a kineticism that eludes them He shoots too closely; hes practically crawling up his characters nostrils with his unhinged camera. Sometimes theres no center of gravity at all so all that motion is rendered meaningless To get a vicarious thrill you have to at least know where you are. Its up to the actors to provide the traction and thats a mixed bag. Elba and Dillon are solidly engaging and at the risk of dwelling on ""Heat"" do the same thing De Niro and Pacino did hold up opposite ends of a movie in which they barely come into contact. The rest of the casting is more about marketing than drama. T.I. and Brown aiming to join the estimable ranks of rappers-turned-actors (can we call them raptors?) turn in passable performances. T.I.s is one-note but memorable; Browns is all but forgettable save for a prolonged chase scene that grows tiresome long before its over. Walker and Saldana dont have enough to do. Christensen is like part of the plumbing. What this shoot-em-up could have used was more complexity in its storytelling Compared with some of the better-known titles in the genre (""Riffifi"" ""Topkapi"" ""The Asphalt Jungle"") ""Takers"" is strictly smash-and-grab. It could have used fewer people too or at least fewer poses A story this thin can only prop up so much tude.Contains adult content violence and vulgarity.

"Takers | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; takers ) Takers (United States 2010) August 26 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli Takers is a standard-order heist flick that stays mostly true to its B-movie roots until the end when director John Luessenhop attempts to inject a little seriousness (theres some slow-motion and even an operatic score) into an otherwise unpretentious endeavor. The production is slick and fast-paced dropping in bits and pieces of exposition along the way without slowing things down too much. The style feels a little like that of the recently departed TV show 24 albeit without Kiefer Sutherland the split screens and the ticking clock. Takers is an entertaining throw-away - fun but ultimately unmemorable. Its hard to imagine anyone who sees the movie not being at least moderately engaged. In what may be a mistake the story elects to focus not only on the group of criminals planning the heist but on the pair of cops attempting to head them off and take them down. I write ""mistake"" because as everyone knows the most entertaining aspect of any entry into this sub-genre is the planning and execution of the crime. Spending an inordinate amount of time with the police detracts from the central pleasure of the heist. The screenwriters flesh out the cop characters by giving them families and backstories but it ultimately seems superfluous. The film slows down every time the scene shifts from the ""bad"" guys to the ""good"" guys. The Takers are a group of five bank robbers John (Paul Walker) Gordon (Idris Elba) A.J. (Hayden Christensen) and brothers Jesse (Chris Brown) and Jake (Michael Ealy). They specialize in elaborate schemes that involve high paydays. The stakes go up when a former compatriot Ghost (Tip T.I. Harris) is released from prison and comes to his old buddies with a plan for a major score against an armored car. With  signs in his eyes Ghost isnt taking ""no"" for an answer; John and Gordon are suspicious but not suspicious enough to refuse the bait. 25 million is a lot to turn down. Meanwhile a pair of cops Jack Welles (Matt Dillon) and Eddie Hatcher (Jay Hernandez) are on the criminals trail but theyre more than two steps behind. And with Internal Affairs breathing down Jacks neck the possibility exists that hell be taken off the case before he can make the bust. But Jack soldiers on with an almost self-destructive obsession even putting his young daughter in danger at one point. It seems destined that the fates of the Takers Ghost and the police will collide somewhere in the streets of Los Angeles. To comprise his cast Luessenhop has picked performers from three groups those who have screen experience but are below the radar (Idris Elba Matt Dillon) those who are commonly viewed as ""has beens"" (Paul Walker Hayden Christensen) and those who are moonlighting from the music business (Chris Brown T.I.). Its easy to tell the actors even those who dont come with impressive resumes from the wannabes. Dillon invests his character with the depth and believability of a tortured soul who wants to do right but cant quite control himself. Walker has a suave smooth delivery. And (in a small role) Zoe Saldana exudes sexuality (she must have accepted this role before hitting it big with 2009s twosome of Star Trek and Avatar). On the other hand Chris Brown gives a one-note portrayal (although an extended chase sequence makes us believe his character is wearing an ""S"" under his clothing) and T.I. wavers between being serpentine and wooden. Hes not the most convincing or menacing villain. Takers provides most of the characters little subplots. Gordon is caring for an older sister whos in rehab. Jesse and Jake are looking after each other. Jacks life is falling apart and he cant get his priorities straight. Eddie has money problems. None of this amounts to much but the details at least present a more colorful canvas. The caper is under-represented with surprisingly little time devoted to its preparation and execution. Theres plenty of action especially late in the proceedings but Luessenhop makes sure there are enough punctuation marks in the first two acts for viewers with short attention spans not to lose interest. Takers 107 minutes move swiftly and goes down smoothly. The ending is a bit too grim and borderline-pretentious for a movie of this sort but for as long as it stays close to the basics of the genre its not a bad way to spend an evening.

"Takers No give all take | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesTakers No give all takeThe dressing up is aces but the heist not so much.Hayden Christensen in a scene from Takers.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Aug. 26 2010 Takers (out of 4) Starring Idris Elba Matt Dillon Paul Walker Hayden Christensen Chris Brown and Zoe Saldana. Directed by John Luessenhop. 106 minutes. At major theatres. 14A The slick young thieves of Takers are so into playing dress up you wonder how they find time to plot their absurdly elaborate heists. Indeed when these dudes arent modeling the latest European fashions they enjoying acting out as cops construction workers and bikers. All they need is a cowboy an Indian and a sailor and they could be a Village People tribute band. The heist part of the saga which mainly involves a daring 25 million Brinks bash on the streets of L.A. isnt quite so impressive. This is not good news for anyone seeking late-summer caper escape. The screenplay is credited to four writers director John Luessenhop among them and theyve all been busy cutting-and-pasting from other movies. At one point one of the thieves urges the others to ""go Italian Job"" referring to just one of many better heist flicks that this one lifts from. They also seem determined to always do things the hard way such as blowing up a city street so that armored cars fall into the holes created by the explosion. Way not to attraction attention to yourselves guys. Would it have been asking to much to have sharks with laser beams on their frickin heads? Such scriptural insanity wouldnt be a problem -- just ask George Clooney and his Oceans 11+ crew -- if the characters were interesting. Which alas they arent. Most of the heisters played by Hayden Christensen Paul Walker Chris Brown and Michael Ealy simply fail the believability test. They look as though theyd have trouble passing fake I.D. to get into bar let alone knock off a bank or armored car. The same goes for the freshly sprung jailbird played by rapper Tip ""T.I."" Harris who also produced the film. We meet him as hes savoring a fine Scotch that also serves as a dandy product placement. Hes the one proposing the Brinks job but first he has a single malt to nurse. The women in the film -- Zoe Saldana as a worried fiancee Marianne Jean-Baptiste as a junkie sibling -- fare worse than the men since theyre in the film solely to give the tough guys a sense of humanity. Fortunately the takers are led by Idris Elba of TVs The Wire a mature man of physical and mental heft who actually looks as though he could do some damage to a security system. He also helpfully explains the title ""Were takers gents. Thats what we do."" Another plus is that theyre all pursued by an LAPD detective played by Matt Dillon who convincingly summons righteous flatfoot doggedness. Hes so determined to nail his prey he pursues them even when he has his young daughter in the car. Dillon sometimes seems as if hes reprising his role in Crash but that hardly matters amidst all the flash pots and fake bullets. And -- pow -- does Takers go off after a fashion. The camera never stops moving being as jittery as if it had been mounted atop an excited chimp. This plus the frequent use of slo-mo and the skull-pounding soundtrack are almost enough to induce palsy in the viewer. Its not enough to further Takers as a franchise in the making which is what its backers fervently hope. This gang can dress up but it has nowhere to go.

Joe Neumaier Thursday August 26 2010 400 AM Title Takers To get a B-movie really rolling there needs to be a real B-movie cast who can chew scenery with the best of them easily aim a gun and drive cars with gusto. ""Takers"" has exactly that crew and they help drive this heist thriller out of the basement even if it never hits the big score.Chief among them is Matt Dillon who as in last years ""Armored"" scowls and broods through an entire movie like a man nursing four ulcers. He plays Jack a cop caught up in his own obsessive hunt for a team of bank robbers known for their precision and ruthlessness. Theyre led by Gordon (Idris Elba) and his right-hand man John (Paul Walker) buddies who celebrate each multimillion dollar job with extra doses of extravagant living. Brothers Jesse (Chris Brown) and Jake (Michael Ealy) work out their familial issues by participating in these capers while A.J. (Hayden Christensen) a porkpie-hatted hipster is the strategist who knows exactly what explosive should go where to create maximum boom.The gang is thrown off their balance by the reappearance of an ex-cohort called Ghost (T.I.) who went to prison after one of their robberies went down wrong half a decade ago. Seething but chummy Ghost wants everything his onetime partners have including Jesses fiancee (""Avatars"" lovely Zoe Saldana). But Jack and his partner (Jay Hernandez) are closing in faster than a getaway can be planned and their dangerous last holdup isnt as top-secret as they think.""Takers"" opens with a snappy escape via a stolen television helicopter and never matches it though there is a cool chase that careens across L.A. streets through an office building and out a window and a tense stand-off in a restaurant kitchen. Matt Dillon stars as Jack a cop hunting for a team of bank robbers in Takers. (Suzanne Tenner) Director John Luessenhop - a Wall Street attorney-turned-filmmaker - keeps things moving though in some of the breaks in the action he should have passed on crucial information; these well-dressed criminals could still be enigmas even if we knew some backstory.Dillon and Hernandez know how to fill in the gaps in that area and Elba for his part can turn a slow burn into something resembling a monologue. Dillons turn is genre-specific but not at all phoned in; this New York State native so familiar after 30 years in movies was the only Oscar nominated for the Best Picture-winning ""Crash"" and can go from sneer to smirk in a heartbeat. Amidst the gangsta posing and some overly operatic shootouts he helps give ""Takers"" some crucial currency.

"Movie review Takers - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Armored CarMovie review TakersPaul Walker Hayden Christensen Matt Dillon T.I. and more star in a time-heister.August 27 2010|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic ""Takers"" the new heist movie starring blah blah blah blah blah and T.I. (whos scary bad and just plain scary) would be a good snooze if it werent for all the noisy gunfire and explosions and the violins a which always signal a ""special"" shootout that will unfold in that ballet-of-death style thats supposed to be arty but just feels tedious here. Did I mention the dialogue? Well really the armored car driver put it best when he said ""Were in trouble herea|"" No joke. The movie is about an upscale gang of five ""Takers"" (their quotes this time) or as Paul Walkers sharpshooter John puts it in a deeply reflective moment as they consider the merits of a last-minute armored car heist that requires blowing up an L.A. city street midday and midtown a ""Were takers. We take things. Thats what we do."" Well said John but maybe they should have been planners. Shouldnt that be someones job a director John Luessenhop perhaps? Or the screenwriters Peter Allen amp; Gabriel Casseus and Luessenhop amp; Avery Duff? (The punctuation specifics imply two separate writing teams worked their way through the script and still to no avail.) But back to the action. So we meet this gang of takers tricked out in black and carrying big guns robbing a bank that is on the 14th floor of a high-rise. Huh? A bank heist that requires multiple elevator rides well that is different. Matt Dillon and Jay Hernandez are Jack and Eddie the bad cop-good cop a or is it good cop-bad cop? a guys on their tail. In the gang besides Walker theres Hayden Christensen as piano-playing A.J. who wields a mean broomstick in a pinch; Chris Brown and Michael Ealy as brothers Jesse and Jake; and Idris Elba as Gordon the brains of the bunch but then hes sporting a great Caribbean accent so you know hes got to be in charge. Zoe Saldana shows up as Jakes love interest and to remind us shes still cigarette thin and gorgeous. And then theres rapper Clifford ""T.I."" Harris as Ghost the newly paroled buddy who once took a fall for the gang and has turned up like a bad penny looking to make a big score and settle a few others. The problem with T.I. is that he just cant seem to climb out of his own skin so the same swagger and style that work for him on stage when hes got all those dancers and drums and DJs feel flat against the movies soundtrack. He doesnt even get violins. Ghosts big idea is an armored car robbery that cant go wrong. Right. Theres another set of bad guys to keep up with a Russian mobsters that Ghost hooked up with in prison. Theres a lot of talk of C4 the plastic explosives the gang favors like ""not many people know how to use C4"" ""its not easy to find C4"" ""this C4 fixation is really boring"" (OK Im making some of that up.) Its not all bad news here. Brown and Ealy are very good as brothers with Brown responsible for one of the films better action sequences a a complicated footrace through downtown L.A. that has him hurdling up and over buildings cars walls fences and people at breakneck speed. But the best is Dillon whose cop may or may not be compromised and who uses that laconic cynicism of his to take the really ridiculous scenes hes handed and make them mostly believable. For those looking to get their firepower fix ""Takers"" tries and tries again. There are countless shootouts and showdowns and lots of C4 explosions with director of photography Michael Barrett using any number of cinematic styles that do not for the most part mesh. But the hotel room machine gun gangbang that sends feathers flying as though 500 goose down pillows bit the dust to make it happen is so bad its good. Even with all of the action and with a few plot twists that are kinda cool theres really not enough to ""Takers"" to make it worth your time.

ABOUT THE MOVIETakers  out of four Stars Matt Dillon Jay Fernandez Paul Walker Idris Elba Michael Ealy Chris Brown Hayden Christensen Tip ""T.I"" HarrisDirector John LuessenhopDistributor Sony Pictures EntertainmentRating PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action a sexual situation/partial nudity and some languageRunning time 1 hour 47 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Whats a quintet of hunky GQ-worthy robbers to do? TAKE A LOOK Watch the trailer for Takers Apparently take and keep on taking. Dont ever mistake these cocky guys for a bunch of givers. Their philosophy is summed up succinctly by one of the smooth criminals ""Were takers. Thats what we do We take."" Who would have guessed? Takers director John Luessenhops work bears the obvious influence of action director Michael Mann. With its downtown Los Angeles setting and world of slick bad guys and hard-core cops this hackneyed heist movie comes off like Heat lite. The dialogue is cliched and laughable. Its a film far more concerned with style -- architectural vehicular and wardrobe-related -- than substance. When not in ski masks or hard hats during an elaborate armored-car takeover these five handsome guys walk side-by-side in fashionable threads drink Dom Perignon smoke Cuban cigars read the Bloomberg Report and generally loll about in penthouse apartments or swimming pools. Theres even an underwear-modeling moment worthy of a Calvin Klein ad. The movie opens with an elaborate bank robbery led by Gordon (Idris Elba). His crew includes best buddy John (Paul Walker) brothers Jesse and Jake (Chris Brown and Michael Ealy) and frat boy hipster A.J. (Hayden Christensen). The casting director gets points for assembling guys who would be unlikely to inhabit the same screen. Each of the five struts his macho stuff but Browns breathless foot chase through Los Angeles traffic provides the movies best moments. There are original touches amid the ubiquitous crimson sunsets and blurrily lit skylines. The guys hijack a TV news chopper for a getaway vehicle and in the well-orchestrated armored-car robbery a busy thoroughfare is blown up and trucks are driven recklessly into a bombed-out hole under a street. The guys are pursued by determined LAPD officers Jack (Matt Dillon) and Eddie (Jay Fernandez) seemingly the only police in Southern California not hanging out at the doughnut shop. Jack has a messed-up personal life -- is there any other kind for a movie cop? -- and pulls stunts such as bringing his young daughter along on a car chase. The characters are uniformly one-note from stereotypical Russian mobsters to Ghost (Tip ""T.I."" Harris) a former member of the stylish gang who emerges from prison quoting Genghis Khan and prepped for a multimillion-dollar job. Elba stands out with a coiled intensity that works for the part. Zoe Saldana plays the ""hottie girlfriend"" passed from ex-con Ghost to Jake a sensitive thief. Shes trading up in movie terms since her first boyfriend refers to her in unprintable language and the second lavishes her with diamonds. Attempts at Quentin Tarantino-esque artiness go overboard. A protracted slow-motion shootout -- an overused visual device -- relies heavily on imagery of floating feathers amid the bullets as the volume is pumped up on swelling orchestral music. The poetic aspirations of this slick empty-headed gangster caper are hard to take. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Standards Editor Brent Jones.

Since the film is about 45 percent chase scene and 45 percent frenzied shootout -- the other 10 percent is strained macho posturing -- thats an awful lot of blurry whip-pan action defying you to make visual sense of it. Whos zooming who? Wheres Waldo? Wheres the script?Too bad as some decent actors are lost amid the cross-cutting. ""Takers directed by John Luessenhop and written by him plus a committee pits a preposterously high-rolling crew of Los Angeles bank robbers against a raspy-voiced LAPD detective who loves his job too much (to the point of taking his daughter along on a high-speed chase). Matt Dillons the cop and he leaves his sense of wit at home knowing theres nothing in his dialogue that calls for it.The gang is headed up by Gordon whom the British actor Idris Elba plays with the solid leonine grace of a natural leader. Michael Ealy (""Barbershop) and Ramp;B star Chris Brown play brothers the latter acquitting himself acceptably in his first major movie role (he does more running than acting when all is said and done).Hayden Christensen the former Lord Vader himself is the crews designated strategist and hipster noodling jazz piano chords under a porkpie hat. Paul Walker plays Gordons second in command; nine years after ""The Fast and the Furious made him a star he remains an actor in search of a personality.As a group they love expensive suits fine Scotch and high-end cars; the opening scenes of ""Takers are more like an American Express Centurion Card commercial than a movie. The reappearance of a former partner sets things in motion ""Ghost (rapper Tip ""T.I. Harris) has been in jail planning a major armored truck robbery -- or maybe revenge against his old friends -- and he enlists the help of some slavering deracinated Russians. In a movie like this never trust the Russians.You would never guess that Zoe Saldana costar of the most profitable movie of all time (""Avatar) is in ""Takers since she gets two scenes as Ealys girlfriend and isnt mentioned in the marketing. And mercy is that onetime Oscar nominee Marianne Jean-Baptiste as Gordons crackhead sister? But this movie is mostly just about men sneering and flexing at each other occasionally breaking out into fits of heavy artillery. The climactic shoot-out in a hotel room pillow feathers and Russians flying every which way in slow-motion is hands down the most ridiculous action sequence of the year.All told it is formula stuff tricked up with over-edited attitude and worth watching only for Elbas smolder Dillons professionalism and T.I.s odd anti-charisma; hes so repellent you cant take your eyes off him.

Share Tweet Rapper producer and mogul Tip ""T.I."" Harris was recently named ""global creative consultant"" for Remy Martin cognac. Coincidentally or not hes also the star and producer of Takers a heist thriller that feels suspiciously like a feature-length commercial for expensive liquor. Takers is all about impossibly handsome chiseled men in exquisitely tailored suits looking thoughtful and sophisticated while enjoying fine liquor poured from crystal decanters in a series of glossy glamorous urban locales. Theres also a heist or two plus the requisite chases gunfire and betrayals but that all seems incidental to the films real purpose allowing a cast of handsome young men to live out their Rat Pack fantasies--and by extension the audiences. In a case of schlock imitating life Takers casts T.I. a rapper who was recently released from a high-profile prison bid as a recently released ex-convict who was literally left for dead by his stylish fabulously well-to-do former partners during a long-ago heist. T.I.s former comrades whose ranks include such strapping specimens as Idris Elba Chris Brown Michael Ealy callow pretty boy Hayden Christensen and a somehow even-worse-than-usual Paul Walker have every reason to doubt their revenge-hungry former partner and absolutely no reason to trust him. Yet they inexplicably agree to go in with him on a dodgy-sounding heist all the same. At least give the filmmakers credit for being equal-opportunity hacks a subplot involving tough-but-kind cop Matt Dillon dirty partner Jay Hernandez and Hernandezs sick child is every bit as stiffly acted and woodenly written as the business involving the heist. Director John Luessenhop and his co-screenwriters Peter Allen Gabriel Casseus and Avery Duff futilely attempt to add a little substance to the flashy nonsense with a subplot involving Elbas troubled bond with crack-addicted sister Marianne Jean-Baptiste. But in spite of the pedigree of the actors involved the relationship feels shoehorned in from another movie altogether. Besides too much--or for that matter any--characterization might get in the way of the films raison detre standing-around-looking-cool sequences.

"Takers (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Takers (PG-13) Cliches dont sink this exciting crime drama Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald8/25/2010 Editor rating 3 A crackling crime drama assembled from a scrap heap of hoary cliches Takers proves that everything old can sometimes really be new again. Everything in this stylish exciting movie has been borrowed from other pictures from the suave resourceful bank robbers who execute perfect crimes to the pair of dogged police officers hellbent on nabbing them. But the familiarity of the material is overcome by stylish unobtrusive direction by John Luessenhop who keeps the visuals vibrant and flashy without resorting to assaultive overkill and an eclectic ensemble cast of actors you never imagined would ever appear in the same movie. Cribbing heavily from Michael Manns crime epic Heat (including an elaborate sequence involving the heist of an armored car) Takers makes the bad guys as engaging and charismatic as the heroes so even though they are nonviolent criminals who occasionally - and reluctantly - must kill you dont necessarily want to see them get caught. These five slick thieves (Idris Elba Paul Walker Hayden Christensen Michael Ealy and Chris Brown) dress like GQ models read the Bloomberg Report live in swanky penthouse apartments and relax in swimming pools pre-populated by bikini-clad hotties. They are also meticulous about planning their ingenious crimes - when they rob a bank they use a TV news chopper as their getaway vehicle - which makes life a lot harder for LAPD detectives Jack (Matt Dillon) and Eddie (Jay Hernandez) assigned to apprehend crooks who never leave so much as a fingerprint behind The cops dont even know the gang members names or what they look like. The wrench in the posses well-laid plans comes in the form of Ghost (Tip ""T.I. Harris) a former member of the group who served four years in prison without flipping on his cronies. Ghost feels hes owed some payback for his loyalty and he also has a detailed plan for robbing an armored car that would bring a 30 million haul. Although Ghost is something of a loose cannon and his trustworthiness is questionable (he also likes to quote Genghis Khan which should always be a reason for pause) the gangs leader Gordon (Elba) looks over the scheme and decides to go for it. Despite much of the movies predictability (the just-sprung felon with questionable motives; the workaholic cop being investigated by internal affairs; meetings with Russian mobsters that result in violence) the film feels fresh and invigorating. There are some expertly orchestrated action set pieces such as a great long foot chase between Brown and Dillon (the movies equivalent of an extended car chase) or a hotel suite shoot out with characters blasting away at each other in tight quarters that outguns the climactic standoff in True Romance. And the plot does manage to come up with a couple of curve balls most notably the ending which you wont be able to guess no matter how many crime pictures youve seen. Takers doesnt break any new ground and is far from essential but it goes down smooth and easy - a tall refreshing ice-cool chaser to a long mostly dry summer movie season.

Graced with ample style if not much substance ""Takers"" is a respectable but watered-down heist movie that given the Los Angeles setting either owes a debt to director Michael Mann or suggests an unusually violent and action-packed episode of ""Entourage."" Following his directorial debut ""Lockdown"" John Luessenhop maintains a crisp pace and weaves in one breakneck foot chase through downtown L.A. thats nearly worth the admission price. The dialogue and character beats however consistently fall flat which should limit appeal to a young male predominantly urban audience looking for some modest late-summer mayhem. Pic opens with a sharply executed bank robbery sequence introducing a quintet of high-tech almost gentlemanly thieves. Theyre led by Gordon (""The Wires"" Idris Elba getting to use his own British accent) whose crew includes brothers Jake and Jesse (Michael Ealy and Chris Brown respectively) and pals John (Paul Walker) and A.J. (Hayden Christensen). Theyre a steal-hard play-hard bunch which is primarily an excuse to show them sauntering around in cool threads set to music at times resembling a mens cologne commercial. The latest job however has caught the attention of driven detective Welles (Matt Dillon) whos determined to catch these ""cocky assholes."" And the gang gives him an opportunity sooner than it normally would as a former member of their posse Ghost (rapper-producer Tip ""T.I."" Harris) comes fresh out of jail bearing an offer they cant refuse an armored-car takedown that will net them a cool 25 million. From there let the games begin. The criminals plot their elaborate scheme with Welles and his partner (Jay Hernandez) in hot pursuit. Yet thanks to a script credited to four writers (among them Luessenhop) this slick vehicle stalls every time it slows down to introduce material related to the characters partly because its so unrelentingly hackneyed. That deficiency especially plagues the lone females -- Jakes fiancee (Zoe Saldana in less than a cameo) who has a past with Ghost and Gordons sister (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) a drug addict. Elba possesses such a commanding presence that his glare goes a long way but the rest of the cast members cant do much with their roles which offer scant motivation -- even regarding the potential romance of pulling one grand job. Wearing two hats Harris has done his producer self no favors by occupying a pivotal part with a performance that can at best be characterized as a one-note sneer. The echoes of Mann are partially evoked by the pounding music from composer Paul Haslinger who became a member of Tangerine Dream a few years after the groups memorable score for Manns 1981 thriller ""Thief."" The movie also makes impressive use of Los Angeles as a backdrop particularly in terms of shooting action scenes in well-trafficked metro areas. Still in musical terms ""Takers"" seems to harbor some greater operatic aspirations (witness the overused slow-motion shootouts) and winds up delivering little more than bland pop. In that respect the movie offers audiences a dilemma that its central characters could surely appreciate -- a heist without much of a payoff.

TWITTER Although ""Takers"" pales alongside ""Rififi""or ""The Killing"" its a serviceable B-movie that will do decent business during the dog days of August. By now there have been so many classic heist movies that its hard to imagine a fresh variation on the theme but the genre never quite loses its appeal to filmmakers or audiences. Although ""Takers"" pales alongside ""Rififi""or ""The Killing"" its a serviceable B-movie that will do decent business during the dog days of August. A gang of five high-living bank robbers (Paul Walker Idris Elba Hayden Christensen Michael Ealy and singer Chris Brown) has managed to pull off several lucrative jobs through meticulous planning. But when a former colleague gets out of jail and suggests an armored-car robbery that might be their biggest score the robbers throw caution to the winds. You know they are heading for trouble this time partly because of tensions among the thieves and partly because a pair of cops (Matt Dillon and Jay Hernandez) are hot on their trail. In addition they have to contend with Russian mobsters -- the villains du jour on TV and at the movies -- who want to get in on the action. The basic arc of the story is formulaic but the writers -- Peter Allen Gabriel Casseus director John Luessenhop and Avery Duff -- provide enough clever twists and character details to keep the vehicle humming along efficiently. The cast also helps to enliven the material. Dillon captures the world-weary cynicism of a dogged sometimes brutal cop who often is in trouble with his superiors. Hernandez is likable as his more laid-back partner who is harboring a few dark secrets of his own. Among the crooks the British-born Elba conveys the right gravitas as leader of the pack and hip-hop performer Tip ""T.I."" Harris is convincingly slimy and explosive as the ex-con who threatens the gangs cohesiveness. Oscar nominee Marianne Jean-Baptiste has a small but juicy role as Elbas drug-addicted sister who seems sure to cause additional trouble for the band of thieves. Aside from Jean-Baptiste there are virtually no women in this caper. Its strictly a testosterone-drenched adventure which would be fine if the director didnt suffer from the latest affliction in action movies a form of cinematic ADD. Luessenhops camera is never at rest and his frenetic editing style often detracts from the tension. Theres a foot chase through downtown Los Angeles that might have been a classic sequence except that its been chopped up ferociously as if it had been spliced by a Benihana chef gone berserk. In a movie like ""The French Connection"" the chase sequences had visual clarity as well as nail-biting suspense. In ""Takers"" the director never firmly establishes the locations and the herky-jerky editing further muddies the action. Nevertheless the stunt work is amazing and the pace is breathless enough to keep one watching right up to the somewhat ambiguous conclusion. Michael Barretts cinematography is suitably slick and Paul Haslingers music gets a tad pretentious. Luckily the actors always help to humanize the mayhem.
