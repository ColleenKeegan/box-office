Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Boldly reimagining Kathryn Bigelows cult favorite as a movie where absolutely nobody seems to be having any fun the new Point Break drops the originals Zen-like balance of macho mysticism and camp in favor of dour humorlessness. The surfing bank robbers are now globetrotting ""extreme poly-athletes"" and the SoCal sun and New Age twinkle have been swapped out for corpse tones and lots of scowling. Director-cinematographer Ericson Core (Invincible) shows some flair in the technically accomplished action set pieces but otherwise the movie is inane. Downplaying the originals homoerotic undertones while giving every character the kind of loss-of-a-loved-one backstory that passes for motivation in the Black List era this stiff plodding remake challenges viewers to give a damn. What little sheen it has is just the borrowed luster of the original. Luke Bracey stars as rookie FBI agent Johnny Utah now a former motocross star with a hunch that professional thrill-seekers are behind a string of heists. Given FBI veteran Pappas (Ray Winstone barely trying) as his handler Utah heads off to France and soon crosses paths with Bodhi (Edgar Ramirez) and his crew of extreme sports pros who spend their days flying around in wingsuits and having really incriminating conversations within earshot of people theyve just met. Casting Ramirez best known for his magnetic turn in Olivier Assayas miniseries Carlos in the Patrick Swayze role might seem like a minor coup but whereas the original Point Break was a wild mishmash of acting styles--from Keanu Reeves blankness to Swayzes affability to Gary Buseys bug-eyed freaking--everyone in the new version looks like theyre about to frown themselves to sleep. Bodhi and his gang are on an eight-step path to enlightenment cooked up by a Japanese environmentalist guru and seeing as their quest is being bankrolled by a super-rich dilettante they dont actually need money. Instead they are modern-day Merry Men in Patagonia jackets stealing diamonds and freight pallets of cash only to send them raining down from the sky. (In short this is Point Break as reimagined by someone who didnt ""get"" Point Break.) Core whose credits include shooting the first The Fast And The Furious is proficient with eye-catching stunt shots and rugged vistas but he stages every conversation the same way with characters leaned forward as though called in for a plot briefing. For a movie about people chasing highs his Point Break is creepily lifeless. There are narrow escapes and death-defying leaps but who could find any of it thrilling?With its chugging guitars and faux-bleach-bypass color palette Point Break looks like a funeral wake set in a Surge commercial. Bigelows movie made inspired and colorful use of New Age and all-American iconography (college football the FBI president masks) but here theres nothing but empty signifying none of it emptier than the scripts callbacks to the original film meaningless without context. Its ironic that this story about a search for deeper meaning--which the movie takes at face value--should be so completely cosmetic from the tattoos that cover every major characters skin to the empty mentions of environmental issues. It goes through the motions of a thriller (a bank shootout a flight through the Alps a waterfall showdown etc.) but like the proverbial seeker who doesnt realize the true path is within comes out embarrassingly empty.

Share story By Soren AndersenSeattle Times movie reviewer ""Point Break"" is heaven for stunt performers. Which is to say theyre by far the true stars of the picture. To illustrate I invite you to take the following quiz Q Which of these is not like the others? Billy Kemper Michael Swanson Luke Bracey Laurence ""Laurie"" Towner Mitch Toelderer and Chris Sharma. Movie Review 1/2   Point Break with Luke Bracey Edgar Ramirez. Directed by Ericson Core from a screenplay by Kurt Wimmer. 114 minutes. Rated PG-13 for violence thematic material involving perilous activity some sexuality language and drug material. Several theaters. A Luke Bracey. He plays the movies lead character Johnny Utah. With the exception of him all the others are pros in such extreme sports as wingsuit flying big wave surfing skydiving and freestyle rock climbing. And they all were stunt doubles for either Bracey or his co-star Edgar Ramirez. Most Read StoriesThinking of voting for Jill Stein or Gary Johnson? Here are their policy positions3 dead 1 injured in Mukilteo shooting  VIEWDoctor who killed partner child in Seattle penthouse gets 49 yearsAP FACT CHECK Misfires in Hillary Clintons speech6 Seattle spots for truly great pizza  VIEWUnlimited Digital Access. 1 for 4 weeks.Its them whether risking their necks riding 70-foot-plus high megawaves swooping through the sky like Batman in aerodynamic wingsuits or clinging by their fingertips to sheer cliff faces who will make audience eyes pop and jaws drop. Amid all the daredeviltry there surely must be some kind of story here must there not? Well yes. Once upon a time -- it was 1991 -- there was the original ""Point Break"" in which Keanu Reeves played Johnny Utah a rookie undercover FBI agent who infiltrates a band of surfer/bank robbers led by a charismatic and highly spiritual dude named Bodhi played by Patrick Swayze. Flash forward to the present when director-cinematographer Ericson Core has juiced up the concept by making the crooks adept at far more than surfing. And their crimes now have an extreme sociopolitical component exemplified by their midair liberation of a huge cube of cash from a flying cargo plane done in such a way that the liberated loot flutters down like snow onto a village of baffled then grateful impoverished Mexicans. Wealth redistribution from on high. This component is soon shoved into the background as the movie concentrates on the psychological tug of war between Braceys Johnny and Ramirezs Bodhi. Johnny a one-time extreme-sports practitioner himself is tempted by the pull of Bodhis combination of spirituality (a lot of philosophical talk about discovering and following ones unique path through life) and out-there testing of ones physical abilities. The fact that Bracey is the equivalent of a charisma black hole (at the movies center there is no there there) and the further fact that the movie runs out of plot long before it runs out of stunts to showcase make ""Point Break"" a remake that ought not to have been made.

(Valley boy Keanu Reeves as a serious FBI agent? Buddhist surfers doubling as violent thieves?) It has a slew of champions but hasnt quite reached the echelon of Untouchable Cult Classic so the idea of a remake isnt sacrilege. But there are two rules that no version of Point Break should disobey Dont skimp on surfing and never be boring. Thats two unpardonable strikes against new helmsman Ericson Core who also photographed this stiff humorless tension-free remake in drab 3D. Film Details Point Break RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time113 min. More Info Trailer Hes given the agent Johnny Utah (Luke Bracey) a pro-BMXer past so the stunts are mostly staged on land mountain biking rope-free climbing and a bat-like form of hang-gliding called wingsuit flying. Core reportedly used no CGI and some of the trickery is striking but the surf sequences that bookend the film are passable at best.As in the original Utah infiltrates daredevil spiritualist Bodhi (Edgar Ramirez) and his roughneck gang on the correct hunch that they are heisters and becomes like them an adrenaline junkie. (In a dull twist Core turns the thieves into philanthropists raining cash on poor villagers).The casting is fatally ho-hum. Bracey never makes thinking itself look like a gargantuan feat as Reeves so charmingly did and Ramirez while aptly hirsute and macho possesses none of Patrick Swayzes balletic presence. The love interest (Teresa Palmer) lacks the sassy sarcasm of Lori Pettys surfer girl; the jaded older partner (Ray Winstone whos no Gary Busey) is enervated. Where are Buseys ""I was takin shrapnel in Khe Sanh..."" rants when you need em? Point Break Directed by Ericson Core Warner Bros.

Credit Warner Bros. Pictures Over the course -- or should I say obstacle course? -- of ""Point Break"" people hurl themselves off cliffs down slopes through waves out of windows (and planes) and up rock faces. In Ericson Cores remake of Kathryn Bigelows brilliant 1991 thriller the story of an athlete turned F.B.I. agent is mostly an excuse for showcasing impressive stunts.Ms. Bigelows California-focused original is about an agent named Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves) who infiltrates a surfer crime ring run by Bodhi (Patrick Swayze). Here the Australian actor Luke Bracey plays Johnny and Bodhi (an uncompelling Edgar Ramirez) leads an enlightened gang of extreme-sports enthusiasts instead of a crime ring. The Extreme Stunts of Point Break A closer look at some of the action scenes in ""Point Break"" coordinated and performed by extreme sports athletes. Bodhi and company rob the rich and commit death-defying acts around the world to ""honor the earth."" Its all about radical self-fulfillment though the gang also conspicuously depends upon a rich patron who gives a lot of parties.Make sense? No? Thats fine really because the less you try to parse the groups rationale the better. The appeal of this ""Point Break"" is its high drama (the stunts) and definitely not its dramatic filler Johnny getting flak from his F.B.I. handler (Ray Winstone) or Bodhi and his lone female comrade (Teresa Palmer) intoning slogans that could be ads for organic cereal (""Read the flow""). Photo Edgar Ramirez left and Luke Bracey in ""Point Break."" Credit Warner Bros. Pictures Its the globe-trotting feats that make the grade. These set pieces feel a bit more like appreciations of extreme sports than action-movie sequences but the climax -- a wingsuited flight down an Alpine canyon wall partly shot with body cameras -- puts to shame your average frictionless superhero aerial acrobatics (even if Johnny and friends look like flying squirrels in sleeping bags while doing it).Other attractions in the lineup of stunts include dizzying rock-climbing at Angel Falls in Venezuela and a sky-diving grab for a giant brick of cash (which Ill pretend is a visual reference to the classic Nirvana album cover). Nowhere does Mr. Cores film approach the action-movie chops or psychological smarts of Ms. Bigelows original or truth be told benefit from actors displaying the same charm as her stars. But for a number of liberating airborne seconds none of that may matter. Advertisement Continue reading the main story ""Point Break"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Extreme sports.

Photo courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures (Warner Bros.) Noel Murray How the heck do you screw up ""Point Break""?The 1991 original became a basic-cable favorite because of its simple strange story about a band of bank-robbing surfers -- and director Kathryn Bigelow brought real vigor to W. Peter Iliffs script. By contrast the newly released ""Point Break"" remake is tedious and overblown -- as though the filmmakers were so preoccupied with ""updating"" the material that they forgot what made it so popular in the first place. The first film was no masterpiece but it was memorable. The redo seems to exist solely to confuse DVRs.SIGN UP for the free Indie Focus movies newsletter gt;gt; Bland Aussie hunk Luke Bracey struggles to fill Keanu Reeves shoes as Johnny Utah a headstrong FBI agent who has a rocky past as an extreme athlete. Edgar Ramirez steps in for Patrick Swayze as Bodhi a philosophical activist and adventurer who steals from the rich and gives to the poor all while leading a squad of globe-hopping thrill-seekers. See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story Director Ericson Core and screenwriter Kurt Wimmer have beefed up their ""Point Break"" by supplementing the surfing and skydiving of the first film with an array of over-the-top ""eco challenges"" including snowboarding cliff-diving free-form climbing high-elevation motocross and wingsuit flying. Roughly every 15 minutes or so Bodhi and his bros risk their lives in the name of spiritual enlightenment and raising environmental awareness.Quickly the extravagance of the stunts becomes numbing partly because the mix of CGI and practical effects is unconvincing and partly because nearly every sequence ends with a character dying -- with few lingering ramifications.

Of all the tricky feats in filmmaking few are more difficult than revisiting a beloved bad movie.Rejuvenating a forgotten stinker is easy -- you have plenty of latitude and no stakeholders. An enduring classic? Thats ""Star Wars The Force Awakens.""But reclaiming the magic when there wasnt much... (Steven Zeitchik) Johnny himself is responsible for multiple deaths by movies end while working undercover as another of Bodhis fearless tattooed idiots. His superiors mostly hang back and let it happen. The preposterousness of the 2015 ""Point Break"" isnt any more of a deal breaker now than it was in 1991. But while Bigelows version featured charismatic lead performances and ample pop Cores cast mumbles slowly and sparingly at one another until its time to jump off something.The new film does carry over one big idea from the earlier picture the notion that when hyper-macho men gather in a group they encourage each others worst impulses.But theres no subtext of criticism here. Instead the movie seems to admire the boldness of these dudes stupid dares. And since Bracey and Ramirez lack the chemistry of Reeves and Swayze the audience never buys into their escapades. Their choices make less and less sense as this ""Point Break"" plays out.The result is a movie that becomes enough of an extreme endurance test that Bodhi could easily add it to his to-do list.calendarlatimes.com------------Point BreakMPAA rating PG-13 for violence thematic material involving perilous activity some sexuality language and drug materialRunning time 1 hour 53 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times A version of this article appeared in print on December 28 2015 in the Entertainment section of the Los Angeles Times with the headline ""`Point Break pointless - A reboot of the 1991 film lacks charisma of Patrick Swayze and Keanu Reeves duo. - MOVIE REVIEW"" -- Todays paperTodays paper | Subscribe Entertainment Reviews Movies Keanu Reeves Looking for the human moments beneath the TV filters of the Democratic and Republican conventions Back stories and mannerisms help Tatiana Maslany keep her many characters clearly defined TV viewership for Hillary Clintons acceptance speech is smaller than Donald Trumps Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad76deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-point-break-review-20151228-story.html,200,pointbreak(2015)5,pointbreak(2015),latimes

The joke has gone too far in the new ""Point Break"" remake with Utah being played by Luke Bracey (""The Best of Me"") giving a performance so utterly blank that future stage spoofs will need to cast a broom or a set of andirons in the role to duplicate whats happening on screen here. Also Read Point Break LA Press Screenings Canceled by Warner Bros. Generally speaking this new movie seems to exist only to make Bigelows silly surf caper seem meaningful by comparison. The first ""Point Break"" was absurd and hyper-macho but the director committed to the story enough to make it at the very least vibrantly watchable. This remake offers nothing but the absurdity along with a handful of impressive stunt sequences that are both its reason for being and a complete distraction from what little story is happening here. Director Ericson Core (""Invincible"") and writer Kurt Wimmer (whose previous remake duties include ""Total Recall"" and ""The Thomas Crown Affair"") clearly want to up the ante on the action but they make almost no effort to incorporate these stirring sequences into the rest of the movie. Also Read Daddys Home Laughs Way to 1.2 Million in Christmas Eve Previews When we meet Johnny Utah 2.0 hes a cocky poly-athlete with a sports-drink sponsor backing him. After his best pal meets tragedy in a motocross stunt Utah (real name John Brigham) gets his GED graduates college and law school and attends the FBI Academy. (The plot would have us believe that a well-known athlete could pursue this path unbeknownst to the rest of the world as though ESPN or Vanity Fair wouldnt have been all over that story.) _PB-26-09832.NEF Still a trainee Johnnys expertise comes into play when a group of masked stuntmen pulls off a string of Robin Hood heists involving motorcycles and parachutes. Johnny deduces that the perps are trying to complete the Ozaki Eight a series of ""ordeals"" that will allow those who accomplish them to reach Nirvana or bring the earth into balance or something that the movie barely bothers to describe. In any event the list allows Johnny to figure out where theyll strike next which is how he meets Bodhi (Edgar Ramirez ""Joy"" stepping in for the late Patrick Swayze) surfing a tornado-created tube off the coast of France. Bodhi opts to save a drowning Johnny rather than complete the ordeal and Johnny ingratiates himself into Bodhis cadre of thrill-seekers including Samsara (Teresa Palmer ""Warm Bodies"") who may or not be Bodhis girlfriend but who definitely takes a shine to Johnny. Samsara incidentally provides only the slightest distraction from the movies central romance - Bodhi and Johnny get the lions share of longing looks between them and their bare-knuckle brawl brims over with sexual subtext. (It also doesnt speak well for FBI training given the shellacking Johnny receives.) With the backing of a Middle Eastern billionaire the sportsmen tackle diving off a mountain in those flying-squirrel suits (the films highlight thanks to Cores double-duty as cinematographer plus an exceptionally talented team of stuntmen) and snowboarding down a sheer drop of a mountainside. But when Bodhi plans to set off explosives near a gold mine causing an avalanche that will bury not only ore-bearing trucks but also their drivers Johnny must decide on which side of the law he stands. See Video Point Breaks Luke Bracey on Working With Mel Gibson on Hacksaw Ridge If only that decision carried any weight whatsoever - Braceys completely unengaging performance aside Wimmers dialogue offers nothing but stale cliche whether its the barking of Johnnys FBI superiors (Delroy Lindo and Ray Winstone making chicken salad as hard as they can) or Bodhis inspirational-poster-speak. (""When a man pushes his limits he eventually finds them."") Even the Ozaki Eight seems to be broken down into ""Stuff We Need to Do in the Movie Now"" as opposed to some grand scheme of completion. As it is they simply lead from one disengaged stunt to the next and the surfing sequences are so badly CGd that they call to mind Kate Bosworths face floating over someone elses body in ""Blue Crush"". If some of the ""ordeals"" dont involve committing a felony why should any of them? And for that matter why bother with this remake if youre just going to make a Warren Miller ski documentary with the flimsiest of plot to string it all together? ""Point Break"" for all its bro-koans never provides an adequate explanation. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Pictures Washington Post Extreme lapses in new version of Point Break 1 / 3 Back to Gallery There are good guys and bad guys in the new ""Point Break"" movie and they share one trait Theyre all the type of people youd want to avoid at a party. ""A man who pushes his boundaries ultimately finds them"" one extreme-sports practitioner says to another as if the filmmakers had pasted fortune cookie messages on a page in lieu of a script. Our insufferable heroes insist that they get no credit for their athletic feats and then celebrate by partying on a yacht as big as a midsize government building. This ""Point Break"" removes almost everything that was special about the 1991 original and replaces it with a Mountain Dew commercial. Wiped out is the tough beachside Los Angeles setting the bromantic chemistry between the two male leads and one of the better B-movie feminists of the time. Instead we have a sampler platter of X Games-style exhibitions and heroes who steal from the rich and give to the poor -- never mind if a few middle-class cops get killed along the way. Undercover FBI agent Johnny Utah (Luke Bracey) has much more angst than Keanu Reeves as Utah in the first ""Point Break."" The new Utah feels responsible for the death of his friend who botched a stunt that appeared to have about a 97 percent chance of fatality from the beginning. The unproven agent gets in too deep with an extreme-sports eco-cult that is suspected of criminal activity making it harder to choose between friendship and duty. Edgar Ramirez is solid as crime ring leader Bodhi; he comes close to matching the earnest charisma of the late Patrick Swayze from the original. Several of the sports scenes including a mountaintop motorcycle tour and a rock climbing sequence are stressful fun for audiences. These scenes have negatives though. Theyre mostly shot from a distance and take up long stretches of time forcing the filmmakers to cram the exposition into the connecting scenes. The excellent Ray Winstone is all but wasted in the Gary Busey role relegated mostly to waiting in the parking lot. Worst of all is the fate of the female love interest. In the first ""Point Break"" it was Lori Petty at her feisty best holding her own with the boys and then teaching Johnny Utah how to surf. Utahs girlfriend in this ""Point Break"" is much less capable introduced as a sex object during an underwater swim with lots of twirling so audiences can see every part of her body multiple times. She disappears for long stretches in the film presumably to squeeze in a Maxim cover shoot before her next scene. The movie does get one thing right In homage to the original director Ericson Core retained the most gloriously overwrought scene of the early 1990s -- when Utah unloads his gun into the air while screaming refusing to shoot his mentor/nemesis. The makers were clearly paying attention to the smaller details. But somehow they missed all the big things that made the first ""Point Break"" a memorable escapist film of its time.

"Point Break | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; point-break ) Point Break (United States 2015) December 25 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli Give the makers of Point Break credit - in reworking Kathryn Bigelows 1991 thriller they didnt go for a point-by-point revision. Director Ericson Core and screenwriter Kurt Wimmer opted to try something different. Unfortunately different doesnt equate to better. In fact unless youre a fan of extreme sports photography the 2015 Point Break lags behind its predecessor in most areas. The core idea has been contorted to a degree that the initial premise is hardly recognizable. While surfing remains part of the landscape it has become one of a catalog of death-defying activities. And bank robberies have been replaced by a variety of eco-terrorist actions. Although the 1991 screenplay was credited to W. Peter Iliff the final script was doctored by Bigelow and James Cameron. Admittedly Point Break wasnt a highlight for either of them (each went onto better solo work and their other collaboration Strange Days was far more interesting) but their iteration of the story was more suspenseful and credible than the Core/Wimmer take. Analyzed on its own merits or in concert with the earlier film Point Break doesnt work. The Keanu Reeves character of Johnny Utah is played by Luke Bracey. A former extreme sports athlete Utah is now an FBI agent in-training. Sent undercover to investigate a series of financial crimes Utah discovers the culprit to be Bodhi (Edgar Ramirez replacing the late Patrick Swayze) whose gang of adrenaline junkies are following a spiritual path that requires them to complete eight extreme tasks. Along the way they must ""give back"" to the environment. This means acting like Robin Hood - stealing from the rich (the government) and giving to the poor. Theres a lot of jumping out of planes surfing big waves snowboarding down mountainsides free climbing deadly peaks etc. Once admitted into Bodhis inner circle Utah finds himself intrigued by the philosophy - or maybe its just that hes attracted to the lone female member the lusty Samsara (Teresa Palmer). Meanwhile Utahs tough-guy FBI handler Pappas (Ray Winstone) is concerned that the younger man is getting too cozy with the objects of his investigation. One of the biggest attractions to the first Point Break was the actors. At the time Patrick Swayze was an established star and Keanu Reeves was a hot new commodity. The sun-and-surf aspect offered viewers plenty of ogling opportunities. Point Break 2015 has a different agenda. The stars arent well-known and neither Luke Bracey nor Edgar Ramirez spends an inordinate amount of time shirtless. Ramirez shows more acting chops than Swayze and Bracey successfully captures Reeves limited emotional range. Here however the star isnt intended to be the human beings - its nature. Core who wears the cinematographers hat in addition to the directors cap captures some stunning images. The problem is Point Break is so infatuated with the beauty of the wild that it loses any sense of excitement. The movie doesnt work as a thriller. Its neither tense nor suspenseful. And if you start dissecting the spiritual underpinning of the groups actions its nonsensical. How does raining U.S. currency on an impoverished village ""give back"" to nature?  That makes less sense than blowing up a gold mine to discourage future pillaging of natural resources. The first Point Break was a flawed but entertaining popcorn thriller - a straightforward motion picture with enough suspense and eye candy to keep the undemanding viewer engaged.  The remake can best be described as confused. In addition to discarding some of the originals weaknesses it tosses out the strengths. One thing it retains is the ending but considering the new circumstances that retention doesnt make a lot of sense. Point Break is broken.

Picture) Review Point Break remake never manages to catch a wave Add to ... Brad Wheeler The Globe and Mail Published Friday Dec. 25 2015 301AM EST Last updated Friday Dec. 25 2015 301AM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Ericson Core Written by Kurt Wimmer Starring Edgar Ramirez Luke Bracey Teresa Palmer Classification 14A Genre action Year 2015 Country USA/China/Germany Language English ""Bodhi"" in Sanskrit is short for ""being of wisdom."" In Hawaii ""Keanu"" means ""cool mountain breeze."" And in Hollywood Point Break means never having to bother with a plausible plot.The original Point Break those of a certain age group will know was a Kathryn Bigelow-directed guilty pleasure from the summer of 91. Flat-speaking Keanu Reeves looked F-I-N-E fine in a wetsuit as Johnny Utah a former football star who joined the FBI and infiltrated a surf-and-sky-diving gang of bank robbers led by the adrenalized SoCal mystic Bodhi played by Patrick Swayze. That Bodhi expressed his ethos in saltwater terms with such irredeemable dialogue as ""[Surfing] is a state of mind. Its when you lose yourself and find yourself."" Those were some gnarly bruh-saying days of yore werent they? But Bodhi told Johnny that hed see him in the next life and now Point Break has been remade. Unfortunately Ericson Cores do-over fails to catch the wave. Big on stunts and 3-D visuals but tiny on character development and good old-fashioned fun the new Point Break looks great but lacks the cult-hit originals charisma and crescendo. And existentially it never quite gets lost enough to be found.The original and the remake share the same general theme The spiritual battle involving rescue of ones own soul with formidable natural elements as a metaphor and cinematic canvas. Take two written by Kurt Wimmer (The Recruit Law Abiding Citizen) specifies the mysticism and broadens the action. The gang are ecowarriors and extreme athletes not only surfing but base-jumping snowboarding free-climbing and flying with wingsuits.The Bodhi here is played by Edgar Ramirez (Carlos Joy). Brooding and international he and his crew have a spiritual-physical bucket list of death-defying actions that they check off with Robin Hoods flair and a Greenpeace will with spectacularly liberated cash and outrageously heisted diamonds from earth-raiding multinationals given back to Mother Nature and the poor of Mexico and Mumbai.As Johnny Utah we have Luke Bracey more Heath Ledger than Keanu. His corporately sponsored skill set includes extreme dirt-bike riding so in the opening scene we have him and his pal motocrossing daringly on the thin ridges at the top of the Arizona desert. Theyre doing it for YouTube hits Ding Its 2015 not 1991 people. The friend misses a jump and dies; the mishap serves as a far-fetched motivation for Utah to become (seven years later) an FBI agent.Given the globetrotting scope of the film the FBI involvement here is a bit off. Surely these crimes in India France and elsewhere are a matter for Interpol? The jurisdiction issue is of small concern though compared with other script-related situations. Utahs love interest for example is not a love interest at all. The Australian actress-model Teresa Palmer is physically stunning - not the girl-next-door Lori Petty of the original - but her connection with Utah is brief physical and inconsequential.Really all the character connections are just as thin. Ray Winstone in the senior-agent role is mostly used to buzz-kill Utahs case-building. (In the original Gary Busey was quotable as hell and as hungry for scenery to chew as his character was starved for chili dogs. ""Utah Get me two"")Early on Utahs life is saved by Ramirezs Bodhi when the blond-haired protagonist is in way over his head taking on a big wave. Regardless of the bond-forging episode the pair never quite click bromantically. The final ocean-storm scene between them is all wet - quite the fizzler. The rain must be Swayze weeping in heaven.But where Utah at least listened to Bodhi director Core and writer Wimmer dont seem to have bothered. ""Nature will find a way of making you seem small"" the ominous guru says and indeed this film is too far dominated by its dazzling shots of sea heights and big land.As for the wonky plot points the original Point Break story can not be blamed. As Bodhi says ""Only be responsible for your own path brother.""

(  / Warner Bros. Pictures) It takes a very special director to make scenes of sky-diving free climbing big-wave surfing and BASE jumping something to yawn at. Yet Ericson Core must be that kind of miracle worker because ""Point Break"" his update of the 1991 cult classic is basically a cavalcade of extreme sports but with less drama than a highlight reel. Written by Kurt Wimmer the remake has the same basic architecture of the original. Theres still an FBI agent named Johnny Utah (Luke Bracey taking over for Keanu Reeves) who goes undercover to investigate a string of crimes. And Johnny still gets starry-eyed after meeting a brawny mystical anarchist named Bodhi (Edgar Ramirez standing in for Patrick Swayze). As in the original theres even a scene where Johnny shoots his gun into the air while yelling. Yet this is a completely different movie because Wimmer and Core seem to believe that what people loved about the first ""Point Break"" wasnt the cheesy dialogue or the bromance-induced moral conundrum but all of the adrenaline. A rush it turns out only goes so far. A little more character development for example wouldnt hurt. Edgar Ramirez and Luke Bracey in ""Point Break."" (Warner Bros. Pictures/Warner Bros. Pictures) In the updated version Johnny used to be an extreme poly-athlete specializing in dirt biking and winter sports. But an accident years ago shifted his priorities and he wound up in the FBI. Still his plethora of tattoos are in-your-face evidence that he can only put his past so far behind him. In his new career Johnny has been monitoring a group of Robin Hood-esque criminals who carry out over-the-top heists such as robbing a bank on the top floor of a skyscraper then breaking through the windows on motorcycles and parachuting to safety; or relieving an airplane of stacks of cash then making it rain money on a remote village. Johnny has it all figured out. These criminals are less interested in the money than in completing the ""Ozaki Eight"" a series of death-defying trials that honor the forces of nature. Its up to Johnny to infiltrate the group and try to stop them before they go through with their next job. That is if he doesnt fall for Bodhi first -- in a purely platonic way. Some of the visuals are truly spectacular most notably a five-minute sequence in which a group of people wearing wingsuits sail through the air around the Alps after throwing themselves off the Jungfrau. But where the earlier film was punctuated by action this new all too self-important version is the opposite. The story is an afterthought. One chase sequence takes place during a climb up the face of a craggy rock wall beside Angel Falls in Venezuela. Yes the athleticism is stunning. But climbing is not a fast-paced activity making the chase look hilariously sluggish. The scene is less reminiscent of ""The Fast and the Furious"" than a nature documentary about turtles. That set piece may have seemed like a good idea on paper. On the big screen as with the rest of the movie action just isnt enough. PG-13. At area theaters. Contains perilous activity some sexuality strong language and drug use. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

December 3 2015 | 1000AM PT Ericson Cores post-millennial remake of Point Break is a visual dazzler and a dramatic non-starter. Showcasing daredevil athleticism in a way that suggests condensed highlights from ESPN director Ericson Cores post-millennial take on ""Point Break"" replaces Californian surfer culture with the globe-trotting world of extreme sports pitting an athlete-turned-FBI-agent against painstakingly principled Zen eco-activists. Yet what weighs the characters down is not their parachutes or rock-climbing gear but their sententious First World guilt and bland casting; gone is the free-spirited fun of Kathryn Bigelows cult-hit original. Produced partly with mainland coin from DMG Entertainment which also invested in ""Iron Man 3"" the pic (which is being released in 2D and 3D versions) has enough visual dazzle alone to appeal to Asian markets where its opening weeks ahead of its U.S. bow. Having cut his teeth lensing fast-track blockbusters like ""The Fast and the Furious"" and ""Payback"" before helming ""Invincible"" Core who also doubles as d.p. here has poured his expertise into devising jaw-dropping stunts and visualizing awesome natural wonders. But the sense of living dangerously is somewhat lacking as Kurt Wimmers emotionally vacant screenplay fails to make audiences care enough about the characters to sweat over their physical exertions. The movie starts off strong with a bravura freestyle motocross sequence in the Arizona desert. It also provides a cliched sentimental reason for protag Johnny Utah (Luke Bracey) to join the FBI. Handed the enigmatic case of Robin Hood heists in Mumbai and Mexico in which American congloms were targeted and the loot was distributed among the poor Utah puts his extreme-sports experience to good use identifying the perps as fellow athletes trying to pass the legendary Ozaki Eight -- a series of ""Ordeals"" honoring the forces of Nature laid down by environmentalist-guru Ozaki Ono who died attempting the third one. Utahs first encounter with the gang doffs its hat to the classic surfing scene in the original. We are off the coast of not California but Biarritz in southwestern France where the towering crashing waves look like extras from ""The Perfect Storm."" Utah is first drawn to Samsara (Teresa Palmer) who surfs like a Nereid and is then saved by Bodhi (Edgar Ramirez) the teams darkly handsome leader. From then on infiltrating the gang seems to be a piece of cake for Utah and the script wastes little time on either male rivalry or male bonding as the protags get on with their busy Ordeal itinerary. Cores lensing enhanced by outstanding visual effects supervised by John Nelson fully taps into the cinematic potential of such dynamic sports as base jumping sheer-face snowboarding wingsuit flying free climbing and big-wave surfing. Aerial shots of the characters floating between the canyons like puffy cushions in their wingsuits are at once goofy and sheer visual poetry while the scene in which Bodhi and Utah hang off a practically vertical cliff by their fingers must be a milestone in novelty as well as composition. The sheer range of sports represented here through whiz-bang stunt choreography all performed by champions in their field may satisfy todays attention-deficient audiences. For others however excitement will soon turn to overkill and the level of tension dips considerably toward the end. For all the ponderous hippy-dippy talk about healing Mother Nature and giving back to society the eight Ordeals are not described in any comprehensible detail; nor do they relate directly to the gangs actual feats. In the 1991 version surfing was an attitude and philosophy Patrick Swayzes gang of ""ex-presidents"" were blond shaggy-haired airheads who used words like ""get radical."" That they robbed banks to fund their lifestyle was a considerably more anti-establishment gesture really than the tortuous and patronizing actions of the new films bearded and brooding crusaders. Ironically even though they insist that theyre not taking on these challenges for their own thrill they pretty much ditch their charitable schemes by the last few Ordeals while still retaining their tortured self-righteous expressions. Their tract-dry dialogue barely rings true and elicits little passion from those reciting it. In contrast to Keanu Reeves choir-boy innocence at the time of filming Braceys older been-around image and jock physique affords him a more proactive role than that of a mere coming-of-age outsider. The weak link is Ramirez who might have revealed greater dramatic heft if his character werent so flatly written; at any rate hes no match for Swayzes cosmic dudeness. As the films only significant femme Palmer is reduced to a sexual rather than love interest  for Utah. Tech credits are fancy to the point where Udo Kramers glossy production design feels seems in conflict with the gangs anti-materialistic mantra. With a trio of editors the action set pieces look flawlessly executed but the narrative pacing isnt as propulsive as it should be. The locations are spread over France Italy Austria Switzerland Venezuela Canada and the U.S. are spectacular in both their otherworldly beauty and their inhospitality.

TattoozNTech says January 2 2016 at 953 pm definitely agree with this review. this remake of the 1991 hit is equal parts stunning visual feast and underwhelming emotional deficit. no real connections are ever built between characters and interaction is forced at best while the reasoning behind their ""feats"" is nebulous at best. by the end of the movie youre left not really caring much what happens to anyone sadly. pointbreak remake disappointed flop Reply Alice Smith says January 2 2016 at 111 pm Just left the movie. Saw it in 3D. Definitely worth it for me The plot is irrelevant. The glorious footage of extreme sports is worth the price and then some. I love surf and the waves they were filming at the start and the end were comparable to ""Riding Giants"" which I have only seen on DVD. The Alps and an insane rock climb at Angel Falls had my hearth beating. I have no experience jumping off mountains but the flying footage in 3D frightened me out of the idea for good Reply Jack says December 10 2015 at 1029 am People with all the hatred for remakes can go back to the 80s and suck a dick because thats what I hate for people that talk smack about point break.

Reply mike says December 3 2015 at 255 pm When you watch the first movie you see Patrick Swayze and Keanu Reeves ACTUALLY surfing and ACTUALLY jumping out of planes. It was made at a time when CGI wasnt the answer or even the option so they movie was real and worked within the imagination and creativity of the production team. The original also tapped into a subculture that was relateable a the time. The average Joe could and still can go surfing and skydiving and California surfing culture was all the rage back in 1991. The remake has none of this. It is nothing but a 2 hour CGI fest of watching ""actors"" running from green screens and only being present in moments of dialogue while CGI and stuntmen fill in the blanks. I fail to see how the average Joe will find himself riding a dirt bike down an avalanche and recover with a minor scratch. This movie is offensive to the original film and fans of the original film. I honestly hope this movie bombs horribly and will ignite those who havent seen the original to watch it and realize it is a movie that should never be remade or re-imagined. Also I secretly hope this is all a big joke so when you go to see this movie they just screen the original instead. I would buy a ticket for that. Reply Jim says December 3 2015 at 117 pm What made the original so great was the humor specifically Gary Busey and (indirectly sometimes) Keanu. This one looks to have lost the humorous element to go bigger on the stunts. Bummer. Reply Whoooah says December 3 2015 at 107 pm The original was cheesy but The Swayz had enough charisma to make it a cult classic.

Daily Edition Login to download Point Break Film Review 1000 AM PST 12/3/2015 by Elizabeth Kerr FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS A thrill ride in need of a few more thrills. TWITTER 12/25/2015 Cinematographer Ericson Core returns to the directors chair for a remake of cult favorite Point Break. Looking back the peculiar and somehow charming pseudo-philosophical machismo about communing with the earth of Kathryn Bigelows Point Break was actually ahead of the bro-culture curve that seems to be everywhere now and so never wanting to leave well enough alone the cultish film was ripe for a remake. Taken out of its post-Reagan context and remade with a forced backstory and 100 percent more supermodel types (bye Lori Petty) in 3D cinematographer-director Ericson Cores Point Break strips the silly fun and relatively straight-ahead narrative from the original for a humorless if photogenic spin on extreme crime. In 1991 a peaking post-Dirty Dancing/Ghost Patrick Swayze and an ascendant pre-Speed Keanu Reeves pulled off the nearly impossible and made the relationship between the ludicrously named Johnny Utah and Bodhi work. But they also had Bigelows eye for action set-pieces and bro-tastic homoeroticism to play with. This was a good thing. The new hipster versions stars Luke Bracey and Edgar Ramirez arent going to make anyone forget Reeves and Swayze anytime soon but Core has turned in a technically sturdy and serviceable action picture that will play well as counterprogramming during awards season. Point Break wisely leans hard on its stellar visuals and location shooting and respectable 3D conversion which should help generate equally respectable international returns anchored by China where it opens Dec. 3 (the film was co-produced by Mainland distributor-producer DMG Entertainment). A low-demand Christmas Day opening Stateside will make it easily digestible for audiences looking for a holiday escape but beyond that prospects will likely crash like a radical wave crest Brah. The originals 90s surf bums become extreme sports nuts and quaint bank robberies become complicated globe-spanning financial attacks designed to devastate markets -- with a chaser of Robin Hood -- in an overwritten and simultaneously underdeveloped plot. The film starts with a daredevil motocross ride that sees  Utah (Australian Bracey The Best of Me) lose his best friend in a tragic accident. For some reason this inspires him to join the FBI which lands him in front of Hall (Delroy Lindo always welcome). In an effort to prove he belongs in the Bureau Utah shares a bold theory about the global-trotting thieves and gets himself assigned to the case. Read more Point Break Characters Headed to Payday 2 Online Game This is Point Break 2.0s first error. In overcomplicating the bandits motives the film sets itself up for a fall. Theres too much mumbo-jumbo backstory about a dead eco-guru the mythic Ozaki 8 (a series of extreme sporting challenges) and the raid of Mother Earth/the poor and so on and so forth to leave room for character arcs. When Utah tries to surf a rare ocean mega-wave hes rescued by Bodhi (Ramirez Wrath of the Titans Deliver Us from Evil) and just like that hes deep undercover in the gang and knows he has his man or men. The cat-and-mouse between Utah and Bodhi is replaced with snowboarding wingsuit flying and free rock climbing leaving the slow bond between the two behind along with any sense of personal drama. Cue the blown cover and betrayal and the rest of Point Break follows the originals course. Core and writer Kurt Wimmer (Ultraviolet 2012s Total Recall) are sure to include a handful of shout-outs to the original film Utahs frustrated gunfire when he lets Bodhi escape the notorious ""I am an F.B.I. Agent."" moment and a tip of the hat to presidential references. The primary goal however seems to be to make a more timely relevant film that never quite reaches those heights (why does the European FBI office seem to be in a library complete with a chalkboard?). Despite all that Core does manage to squeeze a bit of tension out of some incredible action sequences and gorgeous locations with a chase up (yes up) Angel Falls being a highlight. But the thin connection between Utah and Bodhi never raises the stakes enough to make the chases and extreme dares really land. A late second-act twist involving Utahs painfully underwritten love interest Samsara (Teresa Palmer Warm Bodies) doesnt shock the way it should and ever worse injects zero emotional resonance into the proceedings. The cast seems game if overly serious and Ray Winstone (replacing Gary Busey) manages to liven things up with his typical grizzled charm. Bracey is even less emotive than Reeves though Ramirez shows flashes of genuine true-believer sex appeal in a half-baked role. Technical specs are polished across the board.
