And there are times when goodness is as rare as lamplight in a howling storm.In ""Schindlers List"" Steven Spielberg tells the remarkable tale of a man who did good-the true chronicle of Oskar Schindler a German Catholic industrialist who at the cost of his own war fortune rescued from Nazi death camps the thousand-plus Jewish workers who made ceramics at his Polish factory. Spielberg gives us Schindlers story with such conviction and urgency such overwhelming visual sweep and force that he keeps us virtually mesmerized for three hours.The movie is a triumph on almost every level-of artistry technique humanity entertainment and spirit. Anyone worried that Spielberg has bitten off more art and history than he or we can swallow should bury their qualms. Defying all our cynicism about big-time Hollywood (is he intent on capturing Oskar or winning Oscars?) this is a great movie one of the most powerful portraits of World War II or the Holocaust on film.At the center is Liam Neeson as Schindler the suave arrogantly handsome double agent in a world of institutionalized treachery and murder. Around him is a beautifully acted gallery the victims (Ben Kingsley as the ghetto/factory financial genius Itzhak Stern; Embeth Davidtz as victimized maid Helen Hirsch; Jonathan Sagalle as Poldek Pfefferberg who first told writer Thomas Keneally the Schindler stories) persecutors (Ralph Fiennes memorably loathsome as Commandant Amon Goeth) and protectors (Caroline Goodall as Schindlers long-suffering wife Emilie).The picture doesnt cheapen its subject. It gives us the stark horrific atmosphere of Krakow Poland and Brinnlitz near Czechoslovakia even of Auschwitz-Birkenau itself. It gives the nerve-shattering chaos in the ghettos and camps and also provides a nightmarish portrait of Nazi evil Fiennes brutish smug weirdly comic Goeth a sadist and voluptuary who kills prisoners as King Lears wanton boys kill flies for sport.Neither does the movie slight Schindler. ""Schindlers List"" is based on Keneallys 1982 book and on the memories of the Schindlerjuden Jews saved by Schindler during the war years. And the storys prime fascination lies in its paradoxical take on his nature opportunist and benefactor philanderer and crusader sinner and savior.If at the beginning Oskar seems simply an industrialist growing rich off unpaid forced labor but treating them better than others-a shameless hedonist/rogue boozing and wenching with the top Nazis-gradually we see him changing. He grows obsessed with insulating his Jews from the Final Solution and plays this dangerous game with a headstrong gamblers near-unconscious luck.In the book Schindlers motivations are personal and political. Anti-Nazi from the start he disguises his true feelings-even joining Hitlers party-to make loot off a regime he despises.But in the movie Spielberg and screenwriter Steven Zaillian-writer-director of ""Searching for Bobby Fischer""-play down the politics and humor and turn Schindler into something nearer the classic Hollywood sexy anti-hero who succumbs to his inner goodness. With his leonine profile and massive elegant torso framed against the sinuous blacks of fascist nightspots and the blinding whites of snowy ghetto-yards Neesons Schindler seems closer to an idealized Ubermensch the Aryan demigod of Hitlers imagination. When he switches its Supermans revolt.The movie interestingly is about Jewish salvation and Christian charity-focusing on a lapsed Christian and a Jewry terrorized into near paralysis. Spielberg obviously admires Schindlers odd dichotomy-profiteer and Samaritan-and when he compares Schindler with his late patron and friend Steve Ross CEO of Time Warner (to whom this Universal picture is amazingly dedicated) the worlds most successful moviemaker is pointing up the paradoxical virtues of some profiteers. (A detractor may crack that he sees his films audience as his own Spielbergjuden.)Yet theres only one scene in ""Schindler"" that seems forced the tear-stricken mea culpa by Neeson as he bids goodbye to his workers-a heavily lachrymose moment ending in a mass group hug. Of course this never happened never would. Schindler was too much the charmer and stoic and narcissist to break down in public lamentation.But Spielberg maintains such a relentless grip that he makes you accept it. Many will weep at this films poignant climax the mass filing past Schindlers Jerusalem grave by real-life survivors and the films cast. Many also will weep at that ""dubious"" leavetaking scene.Typed for years as the Box Office King of Kiddieland a master technician with a minor soul Spielberg triumphs so completely with ""Schindlers List"" that his detractors may be as shocked as his fans are surprised and pleased. Theres an almost devotional current running through the film.1 | 2 | Next MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesThe Look Of A StarJanuary 24 1994Spielberg Without IllusionsDecember 12 1993`Schindler Couple Recall TerrorDecember 19 19935 Memorable Nazi CharactersJanuary 16 2004Find More Stories AboutOskar SchindlerSpielbergTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter",http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-12-15/features/9312150037_1_schindler-stories-commandant-amon-goeth-oskar-schindler,200,schindler'slist0,schindler'slist,chicagotribune

It tells the story of Oskar Schindler who was responsible for saving the lives of Polish Jews. (David James) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Tuesday February 17 2015 315 PM (Originally published by the Daily News on Dec. 15 1993. This story was written by Dave Kehr) The secret of Steven Spielbergs effectiveness as a film maker is his complete lack of self-consciousness. Over the course of his hugely successful career from ""Sugarland Express to ""Jurassic Park"" with many interesting stops in between Spielberg has always been able to project the most naive and primal psychological conflicts onto his material turning almost every story he deals with into two tightly intertwined themes the search for a strong traditional father and the desire of a lost little boy to find his way home. There can be few circumstances more self-conscious than those of ""Schindlers List"" Spielbergs dismayingly transparent attempt to win the Oscar the Academy has so long and so perversely denied him. Shot in black-and-white with a running time of over three hours no major stars and in the Holocaust the ultimate downer subject the film flaunts its non-commercial elements proclaiming its seriousness and nobility of purpose - its determination to be ""art."" And yet when ""Schindlers List"" works it isnt because Spielberg has suddenly become Elie Wiesel. Its because Spielberg ultimately remains Spielberg finding his enduring themes within Thomas Keneallys novel and giving them the full Spielberg treatment. Oskar Schindler the sleek swaggering German businessman played somewhat stolidly by Liam Neeson is a typically complex Spielberg protagonist - not complex psychologically (the film makes no real attempt to understand his inner workings) but symbolically. Shindler List review spread (New York Daily News) He is at once the strong caring father who uses his influence with the Nazis to protect the Polish Jews who work in his enamelware factory and he is also the lost boy a surprisingly innocent vulnerable figure whose fondest dream is to go home with his newfound friends as he persuades the Germans to allow him to transport ""his Jews"" to a factory he has founded in his hometown of Brinnlitz on the Polish-Czechoslovakian border. Schindler is also a touchingly obvious projection of Spielbergs own dreams of posterity a man remembered above all for being a good boss for being truly loved by his employes (the film is dedicated to Steve Ross the late Time Warner chairman who was Spielbergs mentor). As Schindler says he is a man who has made more money than anyone could spend in a lifetime yet making the money he has touched peoples lives in a meaningful way - Schindler by drawing up his list Spielberg by filming it. In Spielbergs happily capitalist world profit motive is not the enemy of humanism but its spurs. Some darker projections seem to have gone into the creation of Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes in the films most creative performance) the sadistic SS commandant who rules over the labor camp where Schindlers workers are imprisoned. Goeth is another Spielberg man-child but a horrible malignant one the father as pure capricious power exercising his rights of life and death over his charges the child as pure devouring appetite freely indulging his sexuality (always frightening force in Spielbergs work) by forcing a camp inmate (Embeth Davidtz in the movies only substantial female role) to become his maid and mistress. Shindler List review spread (New York Daily News) The camp with its wooden guard towers and scaffolding comes eerily to resemble a movie set surrounded by lighting rigs and electrical cables. Perched on a balcony overlooking the camp Goeth surveys his domain like a director riding a camera crane. He barks out orders from above to his minions; for fun he picks off the occasional inmate with his high-powered rifle. If Schindler represents Spielbergs highest hopes for himself Goeth the ultimate bad boss seems to represent secrets fears. Not all of ""Schindlers List"" can be reduced to psycho-biography. The films long middle section which describes the working of the death camps is concrete and utterly terrifying certainly the most intense and uncompromising depiction of the Nazi horror ever to appear in a fiction film. (Claude Kanzmanns ""Shoah"" remains the definitive documentary.) Spielbergs great powers as a storyteller appear most clearly in a sequence that leads us into Auschwitz gas chamber; one has never felt so awfully and unbearably there. Yet the feeling remains that the Holocaust is somehow peripheral to ""Schindlers List"" - that it is not so much the movies subject as its metaphorical tool. Whether this is an appropriate material is something each viewer will have to decide.

Directed by Steven Spielberg from a script by Steven Zaillian. City Centre. ""R"" - Restricted because of violence language nudity graphic concentration-camp scenes. Movies about the Holocaust were once overwhelmingly grim and oppressive. That has changed in recent years with the release of a series of more hopeful fact-based films about resistance and survival under the Nazis ""Escape From Sobibor"" ""Lodz Ghetto"" ""Europa Europa"" ""Weapons of the Spirit"" and last years revelatory documentary ""The Restless Conscience Resistance to Hitler Within Germany 1933-1945."" The most visible and ambitious of these Steven Spielbergs adaptation of Thomas Keneallys 1982 novel ""Schindlers List"" was recently endorsed by President Clinton as he responded to a heckler who claimed that the president had done little about the AIDS crisis. ""Its about a non-Jew who as a member of the Nazi Party saved over 1000 Jews by his personal efforts in World War II from the Holocaust"" said the president. ""The reason I ask you to go see the movie is you will see portrait after portrait of the painful difference between people who have no hope and have no rage left and people who still have hope and still have rage. Id rather that man be in here screaming at me than having given up altogether."" Presidential movie endorsements can be scary and self-serving (Reagan and ""Rambo"" Nixon and ""Patton"" come to mind) but this one seems quite spontaneous appropriate - and deserved. In a severe uncompromising manner that none of his previous films has approached Spielberg has captured the terror of the Nazi reign as well as the determination and resourcefulness of those who resisted. He has created one of the most shocking movies yet made about the Holocaust (there were several walkouts at the screening I attended) and one of the most inspiring. It opens today. VIOLENCE DIFFICULT TO WATCH The savage scenes of random cruel slaughter in the Polish ghetto and concentration camps are difficult to watch. Determined Spielberg critics may find it just as hard to handle the final turn toward sentiment. But theres nothing cloying or false about these closing moments (or about John Williams atypically subdued score). The emotions are earned. The story of Oskar Schindler a Catholic businessman who exploited Krakow Jews then became their friend and protector seems ready-made as narrative and character study. He kept hundreds in his factory and out of the camps while challenging and manipulating an especially vicious and childish S.S. officer. The characterization of Schindler is one reason the movie is so involving. During the 195 minutes the story takes to unfold Schindler undergoes a subtle transformation from hedonistic exploiter of slave labor to savior with a mission and finally to hero in hiding. In this key role Liam Neeson uses his watchful eyes to size up dangerous situations to guess how far he can go with charm bribery bluffing and delaying tactics. You dont always know what Schindler is thinking or what hes willing to risk but Neeson successfully demonstrates that everyones a bit at sea in the chaotic world Spielberg so vividly evokes. Its just that Schindler whos a bit of a gambler seems more in command than others. As the S.S. officer Amon Goeth Ralph Fiennes is simultaneously terrifying and riveting. His performance here is so effective that its likely to cause nightmares. The character is introduced as a paunchy overindulged brat but hes an unpredictable adult brat with murderous power and a snaky sensuality - a Third Reich Caligula. The other key part is Schindlers Jewish accountant played with self-effacing brilliance by Ben Kingsley who gives the movie just the touch of warmth and sanity it needs. Powerless as his character is he becomes a kind of touchstone the one person who tries to make sense of ongoing unmanageable disaster. When his life is endangered the audience feels threatened. While Steven Zaillians skillful screenplay relies heavily on these three to carry the story there are many vignettes many scenes about people who did not survive. Children hide in makeshift toilets a construction expert is cynically shot for suggesting a necessary change refugees swallow jewels doctors calmly administer poison to their threatened Jewish patients. More than any previous non-documentary Holocaust movie this one convinces through the accumulation of such detail. EFFECTIVE CINEMATOGRAPHY The decision to film most of ""Schindlers List"" in black-and-white was a sound one. Spielberg and his cinematographer Janusz Kaminski are particularly effective at using monochrome to capture a mood of oppression the humiliation of the Jews in the streets the sudden worthlessness of conventional wealth and status the realization that ""its not just good old-fashioned Jew-hating; its policy now."" Some have questioned whether we need another Holocaust film whether we must go through this once more whether those who were born long after 1945 need to be exposed to this material. As long as the existence of the Holocaust can be seriously debated as long as ""cultural revolutions"" and ""ethnic cleansing"" continue to be a fact of 20th century life the answer is yes.

Like many scenes in Schindlers List this parting becomes more than an indelible wrenching moment of shared pain. It is rendered with a restraint and a prodigious filmmaking technique that transform an image into an act of scarcely bearable communion for the audience.A labor of love drawn from events of unspeakable hate Schindlers List is a masterwork in which Spielberg has met and surmounted the transcendent difficulties of making a viable Holocaust film. Moviegoers may be drawn to it out of curiosity. How will the Wunderkind so far removed from his usual world of wonder and fantasy confront the awful truth? How will the super showman the wizard of high-tech emotional manipulation make us look once more at the unwatchable?The more pertinent issue it turns out is how Steven Spielberg a storyteller of consummate instinct and judgment approaches an episode of barbarity whose scale has defeated so many other honest attempts. The worst of times has brought out the best in Spielberg and it is the delicate narrative balance that makes Schindlers List such a special and profoundly moving experience.There is no escaping that the Holocaust has been better illuminated cinematically by documentaries such as Shoah The Wannsee Conference and Weapons of the Spirit. Fiction - such as Sophies Choice - puts a face and identity on mass suffering. But to humanize is all too often to trivialize. Furthermore any filmmaker who takes on this subject must acknowledge everything from the newsreels that revealed the dimensions of the tragedy to the world to the vast body of literature that has made the Holocaust part of our collective consciousness and - one hopes - conscience.In the true story of Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) Spielberg has found a middle ground on the winter-hardened earth of a Polish labor camp. And in a character who makes a halting almost cryptic transition from selfishness and venality to selflessness Spielberg shifts the focus away from the usual victim and victimizer. We see things through the eyes of a flawed man who found himself in hell and made a Faustian pact with the Devil so that 1100 Jews might be spared.Schindlers List is filmed in black and white but the triumph of Neesons portrait and Steven Zaillians screenplay is that Oskar Schindler remains gray and enigmatic. At the outset Schindler seems to be just another greedy businessman happily wining dining and whoring with Nazi officers and bureaucrats to assure himself a profitable war. The movie gradually refines that view but retains its ambiguity - which is as it should be in a world that has lost its moral parameters and its hold on sanity.Schindler contrives to have unpaid Jewish labor make cookware for the German army and plays the system and its manifold corruptions like a virtuoso musician. Throughout Schindler is caught between the polarities of good and evil represented by camp commandant Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes) and Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) a Jewish accountant who serves as Schindlers right-hand man and guides him in more ways than one.As Schindlers List moves unsparingly from the incarceration of the Jews in the ghetto to their transfer to the work camp it becomes clear that Spielbergs choice of black-and-white was based on more than the desire to evoke old images and documentary style. Initially the absence of color (with the exception of one haunting and recurring figure) may seem to spare us the gore. But it has the opposite effect When a guard shoots a kneeling man in the back of the head the black blood that flows is all the more chilling.The fluent and agile movement of the camera and the detached reticence with which Spielberg captures the Nazis savagery only adds to that effect. We are crushed by the grotesque perversity of it all as the commander looks down at the camp from his clifftop chateau and casually picks off victims with a snipers rifle.Fiennes stunning account of Goeth is devoid of the usual goose-stepping cliches (including those of the cartoon Nazis in Spielbergs Indiana Jones adventures). Goeth frequently soused and always drunk with power is a complex torn man. Perhaps the most telling line in the film finds him musing to his Jewish mistress ""I realize that you are not a person in the strictest sense of the word."" He means it and in that firmly held belief is a hint that explains the unimaginable.Although a Darwinian rule pervades life and death at the camp being among the fittest and strongest is no guarantee of survival. Indeed there is no logic to anything - only the cruelest irony and the beckoning doors of the gas chambers at Auschwitz.No chapter in human history gives greater cause for pessimism than the Holocaust and the conclusion of Schindlers List musters a note of typically Spielbergian optimism. The empty uplift seems contrived after the devastating power of what precedes it. But this coda does not detract from a testament in which a man finds redemption in saving others and a director at the height of his art preserves the past with magisterial authority and conviction.SCHINDLERS LIST    Produced by Steven Spielberg Gerald R.

Pakulas wrenching Sophies Choice (1982) to Claude Lanzmanns fact-crammed Shoah (1985) to Agnieszka Hollands Europa Europa (1991) with its dark bitter ironies directors in various countries and decades have taken a crack at what is arguably the great subject of our century."");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""649"" height=""160""gt;These movies - and there are more - represent a remarkably wide range of perspectives. But as impressive as many of them are they dont fully prepare us for Schindlers List Steven Spielbergs kinetic masterpiece about the Nazi horror.Like the fact-based Thomas Keneally book that inspired it this great motion picture (which opens today in Central Florida) appears to focus not on those who perished in the Holocaust but rather on a German-Catholic entrepreneur named Oskar Schindler.It was Schindler who - at great personal risk - saved more than 1100 Jews by arranging for them to be listed as protected workers at his manufacturing plant.Theres something shrewd and in a way inspired about placing a man like Schindler at the center of a Holocaust epic.In 1994 - here in America especially - it is hard if not impossible for many people truly to identify with the victims of the Nazis. The scale of the misery is simply too vast for most of us to fathom. (In fact a recent poll indicates less than two-thirds of Americans even believe that mass killings of Jews took place.)But contemporary American moviegoers probably can feel a slight kinship with someone like Schindler - privileged unaware of much of the worlds suffering perhaps a bit shallow.Schindlers ultimate triumph - his rising above himself to meet the challenge of history - is a success in which we all can participate if only for the movies three hours. Its a triumph not just of Good over Evil but also of Sensitivity over Complacency.By concentrating on Schindler (and to a lesser extent on a few of the Jews he managed to save) Spielberg keeps the Holocaust at a certain emotional distance. But by using his astonishing visual tools - honed on such mass entertainments as Jurassic Park and Jaws - the director manages to place us right there to immerse us in the horror.Crushed in a cattle car we go weak with foreboding. Trapped and shivering in a gas chamber were engulfed by anguish until our flesh crawls.The storys emotional indirectness - in clear contrast to this visual (and visceral) directness - may strike some as a failing. To me however its more like an aesthetic gamble that pays off powerfully."");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""649"" height=""110""gt;What the visual immediacy of Schindlers List does is to prod each of us to fill in the gaps of emotion for ourselves. To put this another way the more you are able to invest in this superb demanding film the more you are likely to get back.As presented by Spielberg and screenwriter Steven Zaillian (Awakenings) Oskar Schindler is an aristocrat and bon vivant. He enjoys the prerogatives of his position in the world - fine clothes rich food and despite his marriage a selection of women.Tall lean and deep-voiced Liam Neeson brings a courtliness to his portrayal of Schindler thats entirely in keeping with the character as we first encounter him. And as Schindler becomes more and more aware of the implications of the Nazis Final Solution - and increasingly involved in rescuing Jewish workers - Neeson (Darkman) subtly suggests the mans expanding social consciousness.Playing opposite Neeson in many scenes is Ben Kingsley who is cast as Itzhak Stern Schindlers Jewish accountant - and the person who sparks his conscience.Its a carefully controlled performance of small deliberately ambiguous gestures. As played by Kingsley (Gandhi) Stern is a number cruncher who (almost) never overlooks a detail and who brings a similar attention to minutiae to the task of influencing Schindler.The movies most dynamic performance is given by Ralph Fiennes who plays Amon Goeth a concentration-camp commandant. Among the high points of the film are the scenes that trace Schindlers relationship with the savage Goeth showing how the industrialist (who was officially a Nazi-party member) cultivates the commandant and manipulates his insanity.Fiennes performance is so convincingly creepy that he makes Hannibal Lecter look like Holly Golightly. What gives the performance such terrible force is Fiennes seeming plainness - his ability to convey the casual nature of Goeths bloodthirstiness.Also notable in the cast are Jonathan Sagalle as a black marketeer and Caroline Goodall as Schindlers long-suffering wife. Embeth Davidtz gives a particularly strong performance as Helen Hirsch the Jewish maid to whom Goeth despite his Nazi principles is attracted."");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""649"" height=""110""gt;1 | 2 | Next MORELottery results for Powerball Florida LottoLottery results for Powerball Florida LottoDo your homework before painting or sealing cool deckPuerto Rico birth certificates How to get a new oneLottery results for Powerball Florida LottoLottery results for Powerball Florida Lotto"");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""300"" height=""250""gt; Related ArticlesSchindlers List A Dynamic MasterpieceAugust 19 1994Fresh Insights Are Missing In Anne Frank DocumentaryMay 31 1996Schindlers List Evokes Tearful Memories For Local...February 25 1997Schindlers List Offers Lesson About BigotryFebruary 21 1997Documentary Lets Us See Pain Through The Eyes Of SurvivorsJune 4 1999Find More Stories AboutHolocaustSchindlers ListEuropaIndex by Keyword|Index by Date|Privacy Policy|Terms of ServicePlease note the green-lined linked article text has been applied commercially without any involvement from our newsroom editors reporters or any other editorial staff.",http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1994-01-07/entertainment/9401050731_1_schindler-list-europa-holocaust,200,schindler'slist5,schindler'slist,orlandosentinel

"The Movie Reviews - Page 8 - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs (Page 8 of 9)The Movie ReviewsOctober 15 1999""Basic Instinct"" has been making news lately because about 45 seconds of its steamier scenes were trimmed in order to get the film an ""R"" instead of a more prohibitive ""NC-17"" rating. In retrospect this seems like a publicity gimmick because the record-breaking 3 million script by Joe Eszterhas offers nothing more than a series of kinky couplings to gain attention. The picture opens with a statuesque woman tying up her male lover on a bed and stabbing him with an ice pick during their orgasm. What a lovely attitude toward sexGay groups have protested the needless introduction of lesbianism into a murder mystery; they have a point but the inclusion is as thoughtless as the rest of the script. The lesbianism is there just to add to the sexual titillation of the male filmmakers.`SISTER ACTMay 29 1992(star) (star)Was I ever uncomfortable reviewing this picture. Why? Because while most of the preview audience I saw it with last week was obviously enjoying it immensely -- the laughter and applause for the musical numbers was the tipoff -- I sat there only mildly amused. What limited my appreciation was that I thought its reach was so slight.Goldberg plays a Reno lounge singer who witnesses a murder and is hidden as a federal witness in a convent where she promptly revitalizes the nuns and their parish by teaching them soul. And based on that description there isnt a scene in the movie that will surprise you.`INDECENT PROPOSALApril 9 1993(No star rating given)""Indecent Proposal"" (is) the latest woman-hating Hollywood fantasy in which money buys a guy a fabulous babe. It cost Richard Gere only 3000 for a week with Julia Roberts in ""Pretty Woman."" But Robert Redford is willing to fork over a cool million for just one night with the married Demi Moore. Who says implants arent worth it?About the only smart element in this script is that the million-dollar night takes place off-screen. But thats because icon Redford playing a variation on his ""Great Gatsby"" character wouldnt have it any other way. Either he didnt want to look old in bed or he didnt want to manifest the evil of his character.`SCHINDLERS LISTDec. 17 1993(star) (star) (star) (star)By now youve already heard it called ""the movie of the year"" by critics and news magazines. Thats my feeling as well. What Spielberg has done in this Holocaust story is simply and forcefully place us there. In Krakow. In the ghetto.Im not surprised that Spielberg was able to capture the heroism of (Oskar) Schindler; so many of his movies are about the better part of mankind. What is surprising is how well Spielberg captures the horror moving his camera with the fury of a combat photographer on the run.Some of the violence is difficult to watch but there is a story with genuine tension that runs throughout the crimes. And then there is that magical ending that came to Spielberg with only five weeks remaining in the shoot. That you must see. Dont cheat yourself.`THE FLINTSTONESMay 27 1994(star) 1/2Unfortunately much less thought has been put into this screenplay than into the production design and publicity campaign for this profoundly dull enterprise. In other words ""The Flintstones"" looks great but is a complete bore and for my 7 Id rather have seven rock-themed glasses from McDonalds.`PULP FICTIONOct. 14 1994(star) (star) (star) (star)""Pulp Fiction"" takes three pulpy violent low-life tales and interweaves them in a daring story line that doubles back upon itself in a way that just isnt done in American movies today. Add some bracing dialogue that sounds like the kind of craziness you might hear standing next to a pay phone in a big city and what you have is the best film yet from an exciting new talent.If you smile at David Mamets dialogue youll laugh out loud at the words of Quentin Tarantino.`BEFORE SUNRISEJan. 27 1995(star) (star) (star) (star)The first really good film Ive seen this year and a true rarity -- an intelligent romance. You may not have been in exactly this situation in your life but you may have been close to it. . . .In one of the great -- and I do mean great -- pickup scenes in movie history (Ethan) Hawke asks (Julie) Delpy to look ahead in her life say some 20 years and imagine how she might come to regret not having gotten off the train with him. I wont give away his leap in logic but its the kind of smart whimsical dialogue that you almost never hear in an American movie. ""Pulp Fiction"" brought great dialogue to the crime genre; ""Before Sunrise"" does the same for romance.`OUTBREAKMarch 10 1995(star)Prev | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | Next MOREGood times -- and badNCIS moves onPuerto Ricans recall being guinea pigs for `magic pill 2 Sentenced In Slaying Over InsultMayo Clinic Medical Edge Cough that lasts may be sign of underlying problemHormonal Shifts Can Hit Women Right In The Mouth.

Early on just after the Jews of Krakow have been herded into the ghetto an old one-armed man is plucked from a line of people whove been forced to shovel snow. His crime is inefficient shoveling and so he is led a short distance away and shot as if he were a lame horse his blood slowly drenching the clean white snow. Later a Jewish woman trained as an engineer tells her labor-camp commandant that a barracks is being erected on a faulty foundation. With barely a pause he shoots her-and then orders the structure rebuilt. Glimpsed at times in the background of scenes the killings are frighteningly arbitrary-a reckless assertion of the Nazi will. To describe this executionary madness as punishment is to miss the point Its murder as instant gratification. In Schindlers List Spielberg goes beyond ""dramatizing"" the Holocaust He restages it with an existential vividness unprecedented in any nondocumentary film. He makes us feel as if were living inside the 20th centurys darkest- and most defining-episode. As the film goes on we begin to see that the Nazis have in a sense unshackled their ids. Authoritarians to the core they have nevertheless devised a world without true law a world in which they can behave like anarchic frat-house bully boys giving in to their most hideous whims. And since theres no definitive pattern to the Nazis cruelty-the rules keep shifting-the Jews have no clear way of saving themselves. Whatever they do theyre damned. Shot in a rich subtle black and white that for all its raw-satin beauty evokes the authenticity of wartime newsreels and photographs this 3-hour-and- 16-minute adaptation of Thomas Keneallys historical novel is organized around the true-life figure of Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) the suave German industrialist who built a successful enamelware factory with secret Jewish financing and ultimately saved the lives of more than 1100 Jews. He did it by using them as factory workers and then paying off Nazi officials to keep those same Jews at work. A hedonist addicted to women booze and the good life Schindler starts out as an exploiter-he uses Jewish labor because its cheap- and only gradually discovers his clandestine humanity. Why exactly did this man turn out to be such a courageous altruist? Spielberg -deliberately-preserves Schindlers enigma keeping his motivations at arms length. For the most part the Jews are kept at arms length too (though their ravaged Eastern European faces sear themselves into your imagination). Spielberg seems to understand that too much conventional empathy would undermine our apprehension of the Holocausts unique horror. Neeson with his overpowering physique makes Schindler a man of hypnotic charisma but we never quite feel were inside him emotionally. His remoteness often plays as a dramatic ""flaw"" yet its a flaw integral to the films success. Watching Schindlers List the audience becomes in effect the invisible protagonist experiencing the insanity of Nazi Germany directly with a minimum of melodramatic buffer. This primal parable of fear and survival is driven by its masterfully orchestrated detail. When a Jewish man stands amid several Nazis while one of them slices off his payess (the curly sidelocks Orthodox Jews are forbidden to trim) the image isnt shoved at us. We catch it as if we were floating through a crowd-its a grace note of cruelty. As the film goes on the Krakow Jews descend circle by circle into the Nazi inferno moving from the ghetto to the Plaszow forced labor camp to the death factory of Auschwitz. The descent itself is a ritual humiliation. Spielberg has caught the blend of innocence and horrified knowledge that defined the Jewish experience in World War II the conviction that things couldnt get any worse followed by the realization that yes they could-that the nightmare was still expanding. This pattern culminates in Spielbergs most lyrical image of human evil happy singing children being carted off in trucks-theyre probably on their way to being exterminated-as their mothers run toward the trucks in terror. Except for Neeson who succeeds in making Schindler an almost mythical figure the acting is gritty and life-size. As Itzhak Stern the saturnine Jewish accountant Schindler recruits to run his company (and then shocks by treating as an equal) Ben Kingsley uses his probing haunted stare to create a running meditation on the mystery of Schindler. The revelation however is British actor Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth the vicious young Plaszow commandant. Spitting out obscenities in a fey snarl sitting on his balcony with his gut hanging out as he shoots prisoners at random Goeth is like a psychotic yuppie brat testing to see what he can get away with. Hes the slovenly underbelly of the Nazi machine the essence of banal monstrousness. All of which leads to the question How could Steven Spielberg the master fantasist whose ""serious"" films (The Color Purple Empire of the Sun) have distorted traumatic experience into something glossy and saccharine have created his first mature work of art about the darkest subject of them all? On the one hand this must be a film he needed to make for personal moral reasons. I suspect though that the sheer horrific magnitude of the Holocaust  has tapped his genius for spectacle in a way few subjects could. Its valiant title character aside Schindlers List is a film whose meanings are to be found less in its uplifting outline than in its harrowing flow of images- images of fear hope horror compassion degradation chaos and death. Documentaries like Night and Fog and Shoah have detailed the workings of the Holocaust and recorded its hellish aftermath. But Spielberg has done something that cant quite be said of any other film about the Holocaust. He has allowed us-for the first time-to see it.

A remarkable work by any standard this searing historical and biographical drama about a Nazi industrialist who saved some 1100 Jews from certain death in the concentration camps evinces an artistic rigor and unsentimental intelligence unlike anything the worlds most successful filmmaker has demonstrated before. After several attempts at making a fully realized mature film Steven Spielberg has finally put it all together in ""Schindlers List."" A remarkable work by any standard this searing historical and biographical drama about a Nazi industrialist who saved some 1100 Jews from certain death in the concentration camps evinces an artistic rigor and unsentimental intelligence unlike anything the worlds most successful filmmaker has demonstrated before. Marked by a brilliant screenplay exceptionally supple technique three staggeringly good lead performances and an attitude toward the traumatic subject matter that is both passionately felt and impressively restrained this is the film to win over Spielberg skeptics. How the general public will take to a three-hour fifteen-minute black-and-white epic about the Holocaust with no major stars is another matter. Even with the cards of conventional wisdom stacked against it top reviews off-entertainment page coverage possible awards and the Spielberg name should stir enough interest to turn release into an event elevating it to must-see status for discerning audiences worldwide. The gamble should pay off financially as well as artistically. Besides being familiar the Nazi persecution of the Jews is perilous subject matter since it can so easily elicit automatic reactions of moral outrage personal horror religious self-righteousness and dramatic extremes not to mention severe depression. Taking their cue from Australian writer Thomas Keneallys 1982 book of the same name Spielberg and scenarist Stephen Zaillian have overcome the problem of familiarity by presenting innumerable details of this grim history that are utterly fresh and previously unexplored at least in mainstream films. And they have triumphed over the most obvious potential pitfalls by keeping as their main focus a man whose mercenary instincts only gradually turned him into an unlikely hero and savior. Oskar Schindler (the imposing impeccably groomed Liam Neeson) is masterfully introduced in a rowdy nightclub sequence that instantly builds interest and mystique around him as he curries favor with the Nazis who have completed their lightning conquest of Poland in September 1939. With Jews being registered and entering Krakow at the rate of 10000 per week  Nazi Party member Schindler arranges to run a major company that will be staffed by unpaid Jews. Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) becomes his accountant and right-hand man and helps build the concern into a major supplier of pots pans and cookware for troops at the front. In near-documentary fashion and often using a dizzyingly mobile hand-held camera Spielberg (who operated his own camera for many of these sequences) deftly sketches the descent of the Jews from refugee settlers in Krakow to their confinement within 16 square blocks by 1941 to the creation of a Plaszow Forced Labor Camp in 1942 to the brutal liquidation of the ghetto the following year. In fascinating detail and using a plethora of vivid characters the film shows how the black market worked how previously well-to-do families were forced into miserable dwellings how the Judenrat -- Jews nominally empowered by the Germans -- oversaw and carried out Nazi law how some managed to survive and others didnt. In these sequences the seed is planted for one of the pictures superbly developed great themes -- that the matter of who lived and died was completely utterly existentially arbitrary. As one of the characters observes the casualness and randomness of Nazi cruelty was such that at no point could one develop a strategy for survival; there was no safe way to behave and even extreme cleverness couldnt save you in the long run. All morality justice and personal worth was erased. With the clearing of Krakow most of the action shifts to the labor camp which is set in an extraordinary location at the base of a cliff. Looming above it is the opulent chateau of Commandant Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes) from which invited revelers can look down upon the prisoners during glittering parties and in shocking scenes that again are unlike anything previously seen from the balcony of which the commandant randomly shoots helpless inmates as if taking target practice. The commandant is a fascinating creation as evil as any Nazi presented onscreen over the past 50 years but considerably more complex and human than most. He is deeply and he admits disturbingly attracted to the young Jewish woman he keeps as his personal maid. Tellingly both he and Schindler drink a great deal but Goeth admires Schindler for not unlike him being a drunk. ""Thats control"" he says ""and control is power."" Schindler must use utmost diplomacy in dealing with Goeth and other top-ranking Nazis in order to get his way gently suggesting that their murderous policies are bad for business and that to bestow a pardon confers even greater power on a ruler than constantly meting out death. Schindler is permitted to continue operating his Krakow factory as a ""sub-camp"" which becomes a virtual haven for hundreds of Jews in that they are basically assured they wont die there. Still with the Final Solution being implemented with ever-greater dispatch by 1944 Schindler must finally buy with his tremendous war profits the leftover Jews to prevent them from being shipped to Auschwitz. In a harrowing sequence women he has arranged to rescue wind up at the extermination camp by mistake. For Schindler as well as the Jews it remains a question of which will last longer his money or the war. After listening to Churchills announcement of the German surrender Schindler delivers an extraordinary speech of his own in the presence of both Nazi guards and Jewish workers before fleeing with nothing more than a suitcase. Throughout the mesmerizing narrative so masterfully orchestrated in Zaillians faultlessly intelligent screenplay there are many opportunities for heart-tugging obvious plays for sympathy and hate maudlin sentiments and cheap indulgences. Not only because Spielberg resisted every one of them but also because this film is so different and so much tougher than anything else hes done if not forewarned as to its directors identity even a well-schooled critic could watch virtually the entire picture and never suspect it was Spielberg. On reflection some of the themes relating to greed corruption and inadvertent heroism have been present in his work from early on but nothing before has been anywhere near this deep or resonant. Images moments and scenes stay in the mind and become even stronger well after viewing the film. Despite its 3 1/4-hour length the film moves forward with great urgency and is not a minute too long for the story it is telling and the amount of information it imparts. It is naturally full of violence and death but Spielberg makes this both memorable and somehow bearable by staging it all with abrupt shocking suddenness which adds to the feeling of arbitrariness. This is not strictly speaking a concentration camp movie but a densely woven personal drama with the most striking of historical backdrops which is what will get mainstream audiences through it. The only debatable choice is the brief color epilogue which depicts many of the surviving ""Schindler Jews"" filing by his grave in Israel accompanied for the most part by the much younger actors who have portrayed them in the film. This will have many viewers crying their eyes out but it also smacks on a certain level of direct emotional manipulation the only such instance in the work. Another device that uses color is also questionable that of a little girl whom Schindler notices and whose red coat stands out against the prevailing black-and-white. What this is supposed to signify is anyones guess although its so minor that it doesnt matter. From top to bottom the performances from the enormous cast are impeccable. Whereas most major stars would have wanted to tip the audience off early on that Schindler was actually a sensitive caring guy underneath it all Neeson leaves no doubt through most of the film that his character was driven foremost by profit. In a superlative performance Neeson makes Schindler a fascinating but highly ambiguous figure effectively persuasive and manipulative in one-on-one scenes where hes determined to get what he wants and finally rising to dramatic heights with his courageous and stirring farewell speech. Kingsley must act within much more rigid constraints as his trusted accountant Stern a man who feels he must never make a misstep. Role is reminiscent of Alec Guinness deluded Col. Nicholson in ""The Bridge on the River Kwai""; in his compulsion to do a perfect job for Schindler he often seems to forget that hes working for the enemy. The extraordinary Fiennes creates an indelible character in Goeth. With paunch hanging out and eyes filled with disgust both for his victims and himself  hes like a minor-league Roman emperor gone sour with excess a man in whom too much power and debauchery have crushed anything that might once have been good. The dozens of small roles many of which figure in the action only briefly have been superbly filled by faces that invariably register immediately and with terrific effectiveness. Shot mostly on location in Poland the picture captures in exceptional detail the nightmare world of 50 years ago. Allan Starskis production design blends imperceptibly with natural locations. This is a film that could have been made only in black-and-white and yet it is solely because of Spielbergs commercial stature that it was able to be made that way. Lensing by Janusz Kaminski a young Polish-American cinematographer whose previous credits include ""The Adventures of Huck Finn"" Diane Keatons made-for-cable ""Wildflower"" and some Roger Corman efforts is outstanding. Lighting is mostly very simple camera moves are agile and perceptive and palette features many shades of gray rather than high-contrast black-and-white. Michael Kahns editing moves with dynamic swiftness when desired and holds on scenes when required making the running time seem shorter. John Williams score is atypical especially in the context of his work for Spielberg as its low-key soulful and flecked with ethnic flavors. Dedicated to the late Time Warner chairman Steve Ross ""Schindlers List"" has a deep emotional impact that is extraordinarily well served and balanced by its intelligence historical perspective and filmmaking expertise.

"MOVIE REVIEW  Restraint From the Master of Razzmatazz  Schindlers List is a major departure for Steven Spielberg. He and his collaborators have created an indelible picture of the Holocaust. - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMOVIE REVIEW  Restraint From the Master of Razzmatazz  Schindlers List is a major departure for Steven Spielberg. He and his collaborators have created an indelible picture of the Holocaust.December 15 1993|KENNETH TURAN | TIMES FILM CRITIC The more we know about the Holocaust the more unknowable it seems to become. Like the mythological fruit of Tantalus always just out of reach its essence eludes us too awful to fully comprehend no matter how passionately we seek to know and understand it.One thing that does become clear however is that to approach the Holocaust from a dramatic point of view detachment and self-control almost to the point of coldness are essential. The most memorable films about the period from Alain Resnais 30-minute ""Night and Fog"" to Claude Lanzmanns nine-hour-plus ""Shoah"" share this reserve with such memoirs as Primo Levis ""Survival in Auschwitz."" Only through the lens of restraint can those days be effectively seen as Steven Spielberg of all people persuasively demonstrates with the quietly devastating ""Schindlers List.""Of all people because rather than detachment and restraint it is the broad toys-are-us strokes of obvious heroes and hissable villains that have characterized much of Spielbergs output up to and including this years ""Jurassic Park."" But the director with personal and emotional ties to the world of Eastern European Jewry clearly hungered to do something different here.Not only is the subject matter different for Spielberg the way it is treated is a departure both for him and for the business as usual standards of major studio releases. While its 3-hour-and-15-minute length is becoming familiar for prestige items the decision to shoot it almost entirely in black and white is very much not and neither is its absence of major stars and even actors born in this country.And ""Schindlers List"" based on Thomas Keneallys remarkable retelling of a true story is itself a different kind of Holocaust narrative. For if the pressure of overwhelming death and even the release of miraculous rescue have become standard fare the dramatic contradictory personality of Oskar Schindler has never ceased to baffle and astonish observers from his time to ours.A gambler war profiteer and lover of alcohol a convivial sensualist and womanizer who in Keneallys phrase considered sexual shame ""a concept like existentialism very worthy but hard to grasp"" Schindler the quintessential good German was not the ordinary stuff of heroes. ""Though he was Jesus Christ"" someone who knew him said ""a saint he wasnt. He was all-drinking all-black-marketeering all-screwing"" a man whose turn to goodness probably surprised himself most of all. Yet with a combination of nerve money attitude and obstinacy he personally saved 1100 Jews from death and ended up being what Keneally calls probably the only Nazi Party member to be buried in Jerusalems Mt. Zion cemetery.Though this film is preeminently Schindlers story we dont meet him right away. Both Spielberg and thoughtful screenwriter Steven Zaillian (""Searching for Bobby Fischer"") are concerned to first set this story in its time and place to firmly establish the context for what is to come.Things begin in September 1939 with Germanys defeat of Poland in two brief weeks. The countrys Jews are ordered to relocate in the venerable town of Krakow and the chaos that decree caused is shown through arrival scenes at the train station with Germans brandishing the first of the all-important lists that reappear throughout the film lists that can literally separate life from death.Schindler (Irish actor Liam Neeson) is glimpsed initially as a pair of disembodied hands quietly laying out alternate coats ties and cuff links preparing for his own type of campaign. Off to a cabaret frequented by Krakows Nazi elite he enters it as an unknown but by the evenings end he is the most popular man in the room. Written and filmed with characteristic mastery this scene illuminates in a few brief minutes the core of Schindlers gregarious personality and the frankly irresistible effect he had on other people.One of those men who instinctively know how to profit from the chaos of war Schindler has come to Krakow to make his fortune. Simply indifferent to who is a Jew and who is not he decides to take over a formerly Jewish-owned enamelware factory and hires Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) to run it with cheap Jewish labor while he himself does the important work of schmoozing and bribing the military men in charge of procurement for the German army.At first everything about Schindlers relationship to the Jews is situational; when he rescues Stern from deportation and death for instance his reaction is ""What if Id gotten here five minutes later then where would I be?"" But after witnessing the Germans brutal liquidation of the ghetto and the relocation of those that survived in a savage labor camp run by Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes) a cold unblinking sadist Schindlers attitude is shown to change and keeping what he territorially considers ""his Jews"" alive at all costs becomes the focus of his activities.1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESReview Steven Spielbergs Lincoln a towering achievementNovember 8 2012Schindler Stars in Tolerance LessonsMay 26 2003Bernard Adler; Stepfather of Director Steven SpielbergOctober 3 1995LOS ANGELES  Philanthropy Award to Honor Steven SpielbergOctober 1 1994Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword",http://articles.latimes.com/1993-12-15/entertainment/ca-1949_1_steven-spielberg,200,schindler'slist10,schindler'slist,latimes

The ideological structures of Spielbergs films ""hail"" the spectator into a world of the obvious that affirms the viewers presence (even while dissolving it) affirms that what the viewer has always believed or hoped is (obviously) right and accessible and assures the viewer excitement and comfort in the process. The films offer nothing new beyond their spectacle nothing the viewer does not already want does not immediately accept. That is their conservative power and it has spread throughout the cinema of the 80s. --Robert Phillip Kolker A Cinema of Loneliness (1988) Confessions are in order. From Duel to Jurassic Park there are few Steven Spielberg movies I admire and none I fully respect--though I respond to a good many of them as obediently as any well-oiled automaton. My first look at Close Encounters of the Third Kind actually brought tears to my eyes. I cant say that on reflection I felt much pride in this response though the experience of becoming a boy again in relation to the imagined parental benevolence of the cosmos--which also happens with Ray Bradburys best early tales about Mars--may be morally preferable to feeding on the murderous xenophobia of Star Wars released the same year (1977); at worst one winds up feeling silly rather than dirty afterward. But the long-term gains from either vision are questionable. And once Spielberg joined the Lucas camp with the Indiana Jones cycle--combining the ruthless efficiency of Jaws with the colonialist fervor of Star Wars--my misgivings about the power of his work only escalated. If the euphoria Orson Welles conveys about filmmaking in Citizen Kane can be summed up in the line ""I think it would be fun to run a newspaper"" the euphoria Spielberg conveys about filmmaking in Raiders of the Lost Ark expressed in its most effective action moment could just as aptly be summed up by the thought ""I think it would be fun to shoot an Arab."" Indeed while Spielberg has not yet given us a Beavis and Butt-head in the Persian Gulf I have every expectation that if or when such a movie comes along the imprimatur of his divine inspiration will be stamped onto every frame. Perhaps due to my many years of living abroad and not eating the proper number of hamburgers the suburban spirituality of E.T. left me relatively untouched. I was more impressed by the virtuosity of 1941 a picture whose honest mean-spiritedness and teenage irreverence--both partially the contribution of cowriter Robert Zemeckis--struck me as closer to Spielbergs soul even if the picture wound up losing money. By contrast The Color Purple and Empire of the Sun were both grotesque Oscar bids--strained subliterary attempts to make reparations for the genocidal glee of the Indiana Jones romps by expensively dry-cleaning the work of distinguished authors--and I had every expectation that Schindlers List would complete Spielbergs dubious trilogy of good intentions. Up to a point these expectations were fulfilled. But candor compels me to admit that Schindlers List not only made me blubber helplessly both times I saw it once before and once after reading Thomas Keneallys fascinating nonfiction novel; it has also though I have some misgivings won my gratitude and respect. A small but significant part of my reaction can probably be traced to personal factors as the grandson of Polish Jews I am one of those who might have been saved (or not saved) from the gas ovens by Oskar Schindler if my fathers father hadnt immigrated to the States when he was eight. My grandfather a self-made businessman also resembled the non-Jewish Schindler in certain respects--he was a hedonistic bon vivant whose successful business tactics including bribery when it seemed necessary filled him with such guilt that he became a leading philanthropist in the same community where he made his fortune. But while these facts undoubtedly colored my experience of Schindlers List they dont account for why I think it qualifies as Spielbergs best film as well as the first one really worth quarreling with. Just for starters I can think of four reasons to praise it (1) The beauty and density of Janusz Kaminskis black-and-white cinematography ranging from exquisite high-contrast night scenes to richly textured deep-focus long shots to grayish hand-held documentary-style footage. It far surpasses the look of any other new American feature Ive seen this year and reminds me once again how the idiotic commercial requirement of color in Hollywood movies--usually blamed on the tastes of brain-dead teenage viewers (who dont know any better) rather than on gutless producers and other movie executives (who should)--steadily deprives us of both visual pleasure and verisimilitude. I know that ""life is in color"" is supposed to shoot down every argument on behalf of the verisimilitude of black and white but the fact remains that the colors in the life I know have scant relation to the colors I usually see in commercial movies; and the failure (both artistic and technical) of most directors and cinematographers to control color meaningfully has turned good contemporary black-and-white cinematography into even more of an aesthetic luxury. Alas Spielbergs expressed justification for using it--""Virtually everything Ive seen on the Holocaust is in black and white""--is the lamest reason I can think of denying any motive beyond an obeisance to dubious popular cliches about the past versus the present. But fortunately Kaminskis work shows us countless better reasons for what he and Spielberg have done. (2) Spielbergs power as a storyteller. The film runs for 185 minutes and none of it drags or stalls. Very little of it fragments into show-offy set pieces or sequences destined for Premiere magazines ""Shot by Shot"" feature the standard bane of this sort of Oscar-mongering. The most important exception to this is a fancy montage sequence intercutting a Jewish wedding in a labor camp the camp director harassing and then beating his Jewish maid in his wine cellar and Schindler cavorting at a nightclub--a sequence that is on all counts the worst thing in the film. Otherwise the script credited to Steven Zaillian (most recently the writer-director of the first-rate Searching for Bobby Fischer) is generally a model of exposition and pacing. If it leads to certain questions about the ideological implications of Spielbergs method--implications already suggested in the quotation by Robert Phillip Kolker at the head of this review--it cant be faulted for its craft. (3) The performances. Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler and Ben Kingsley as Itzhak Stern Schindlers Jewish accountant and right-hand man are both indelible portraits and as good as any work Ive seen from either actor. Im somewhat less happy with the characterization of Amon Goeth the camp director but the performance of British stage actor Ralph Fiennes in the part is good (in fact I suspect Fiennes may wind up with the most prizes). And the work of countless other actors mainly Eastern Europeans is no less accomplished. (4) The films success at conveying some of the enormity of the Holocaust as well as some of its banal details in a fully accessible manner at a time when much of our collective memory and understanding of it is rapidly slipping away. Much of the time it accomplishes this less through graphic portrayals than through appeals to our imaginations. Another film that took on this task and performed it more responsibly and comprehensively--if less accessibly--is Claude Lanzmanns Shoah (1985). But Shoah is a documentary and explicitly a Jewish film and with an eight-hour running time to boot it clearly cant address as wide an audience. Despite both the subject matter and the fact that Spielberg himself is Jewish Schindlers List is anything but a Jewish film. Indeed as I hope to show even Jews who see this film are implicitly transformed by the narrative structure into gentile viewers. Although the book is technically a novel Keneallys authors note states ""I have attempted . . . to avoid all fiction since fiction would debase the record and to distinguish between reality and the myths which are likely to attach themselves to a man of [Oskar Schindlers] stature."" Though the same claim cant be made for the film--Spielbergs desire to dramatize appears to exceed Keneallys need to fictionalize--its worth stressing that with a few notable exceptions everything in the film can be traced in some form back to the book which is itself based on detailed research including interviews with more than two dozen participants in (and witnesses to) the events described. Thus many of the films oddest departures--such as the use of color to highlight the red overcoat of a little girl in an otherwise black-and-white crowd during the evacuation of the Krakow ghetto--find their basis in Keneallys narrative even when the reason for them has been obscured or elided. Oskar Schindler--born in 1908 in Moravia a province in the Austrian empire that later became part of Czechoslovakia and raised as a Catholic--was a Nazi war profiteer who earned most of his wealth by employing Jews in an enamel-cookware factory in Krakow Poland. He hired his workers in 1939 shortly after the beginning of the German occupation when Jews from all over Poland were already being forcibly relocated to the Krakow ghetto. A well-dressed partygoer and womanizer who excelled in bribery and black-market deals Schindler hired Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern to help run his plant and later managed to set up a second plant on the grounds of a forced labor camp near Krakow after his Jewish workers were relocated there. Then when the camp was about to be shut down with all its residents slated for extermination in Auschwitz he wound up saving the lives of more than 1100 Jews by effectively buying them from Nazi officials and shipping them to an ersatz munitions plant in his hometown where he protected and supported them until the end of the war spending the remainder of his fortune in the process. After the war his various business enterprises were all failures and he was sustained until his death in 1974 by some of the Jews he saved who called themselves Schindlerjuden or ""Schindlers Jews."" At his own request he was buried in Jerusalem; though the film which concludes with a color documentary sequence at his grave site neglects to say so his final resting place is in a Catholic cemetery. Spielbergs film--which functions in part as a fanciful and idealistic self-portrait (more about this later)--is patriarchal to the core even when this means tampering with some of the facts. While its true that Schindler resumed living with his long-estranged wife Emilie when he established his mock munitions plant in Moravia the film shows him pledging sexual loyalty to her--during a church service no less--just after he arrives there. In the book there is every indication that his sexual carousing continued as before which makes for a more intriguing story that Spielberg chooses to ignore; two of the Schindlerjuden told Keneally about finding Schindler one day skinny-dipping with a voluptuous blond SS woman in a water tank inside the factory. Emilies tireless efforts in helping the Schindlerjuden in Moravia--which Keneally attributes to her strong religious convictions as well as her loyalty to her relatively unreligious husband--also get short shrift in the movie. As Spielberg recounts the story this is Schindlers show all the way with only poker-faced Stern posited as a worthy crony and accomplice. The extraordinary tale of collective resistance told in Pierre Sauvages 1989 documentary Weapons of the Spirit--about the 5000 inhabitants of Le Chambon France most of them Huguenots who managed to shelter 5000 Jews during the Nazi occupation only 20 miles from Vichy--is in some ways even more remarkable than Schindlers unselfish feat because many more people were involved in the effort Christians and Jews alike. But Spielbergs interest is generally in lone charismatic father figures like E.T. and Schindler. If the term ""Schindlers Jews"" irresistibly calls to mind the telethon catchphrase ""Jerrys kids"" the notion of the single male parent is operative in both cases; and in this case the single male parent is gentile. One might add that to the same degree that the saved Jews became ""Oskars kids"" we as viewers become Stevens. Another omission relates to the final compiling of the list of Jews Schindler is to take out of Poland with him. In the film this is accomplished exclusively by Schindler and Stern; in reality a personnel clerk named Marcel Goldberg--a character whos present only in passing in the film--put the finishing touches on the list accepting diamonds as bribes from some families in exchange for their inclusion and excluding others when they couldnt cough up the necessary loot. Keneally plausibly absolves Schindler--who was busy at the time pulling strings elsewhere--from any direct blame in this matter but its symptomatic of the movies tactics to omit such disturbing details in order to avoid the resulting moral complications. In the final analysis Spielberg wants to show Schindlers goodness as the ultimate defense of capitalism just as Nazism and the Holocaust itself are viewed as the ultimate perversions of capitalism--horrors requiring only a Schindler to set things right again. Including Goldberg on Schindlers side of the fence would only confuse this mythology. A more general difference between the book and the film relates to our understanding of Schindlers personality. In the book he remains a genuine enigma--the sum of sometimes conflicting and often speculative accounts of the people who knew him. Spielberg whose sense of drama wont tolerate such uncertainty sees this strictly as a conversion story--a Nazi meanie who becomes a saint--even though the implied conversion takes place offscreen. Its an easier story to tell but ultimately less interesting and less believable than what actually happened. (Not all of Keneallys most hair-raising anecdotes are in the movie; I hope that many people who like the movie will be led to the book by it as I was.) The character of Amon Goeth the Nazi director of the forced labor camp and the main villain in book and movie alike is likewise simplified--played by Fiennes as a classically foppish German decadent with Caligula-like flourishes. While Spielberg takes much of this characters monstrous behavior--such as his shooting of Jews arbitrarily or for minor offenses--straight from the book he chooses to minimize Goeths growing obesity. And while he takes the trouble of flashing forward to show him being hung in 1946 he omits entirely an unforgettable scene from the book in which Goeth now lean and diabetic having been imprisoned and then released by the Nazis for his aberrant behavior visits Schindlers factory in Moravia a defeated man. Keeping Goeth slim and glamorous seems central to Spielbergs overall narrative strategy. The point isnt merely to make his villain more theatrical (as it is when in one of the films corniest conceits he has another Nazi officer playing Mozart on a piano in a ghetto flat while his colleagues are busy machine-gunning Jews). The main idea is to assist us in identifying with Nazis--not with their cruelty which were supposed to recoil from but with their privileged vantage point their power and preeminence (Goeth is not unlike a studio head). Schindler himself as Goeths friend and confidant the saintly businessman who even manages to dream up a scheme for curbing Goeths murderous impulses serves as the expedient emissary of this process (not unlike a film director). Thanks to him we have the vicarious thrill of attending Nazi parties and enjoying the lush revelry in Nazi nightclubs (both rendered in some of the films silkiest most gorgeous high-contrast black-and-white images) looking down at the Jewish prisoners from the balcony of Goeths chateau (perched on a hill high above the camp) savoring the luxury of Schindlers new Krakow flat (freshly evacuated by a once-wealthy Jewish family forced to move into a ghetto hovel) and so on. On a few special occasions the film also asks us to identify with the Jewish victims--again as gentile viewers using Schindlers humane sympathy as our guide. On these occasions the shots generally become newsreel-gray and hand-held and the language we hear often switches from English to guttural European tongues increasing our terror with both a sense of actuality and a sense of the unknown. But more often were asked to sit with Schindler or Goeth in the catbird seat. Thats why when Goeth sadistically flirts with interrogates and finally beats his abused Jewish maid (Embeth Davidtz) in the wine cellar where she usually hides from him Spielberg takes care to show us Davidtzs nipples through the slip shes wearing--to ask us to share Goeths unresolved sexual attraction to her. It might be inferred from the above that Im only denouncing Spielbergs tactics. But the fact remains that if he werent this ruthless or this efficient I wouldnt have wept at the end of Schindlers List both times I saw it. And as tempting as it is to ridicule Spielbergs reasons for making it--which probably include a narcissistically far-fetched identification with Schindler and may even for all I know incorporate George Bushs evocation of a ""kinder gentler"" America--it would be stupid to deny that art often grows out of just such contradictions. Its virtually axiomatic that to make a big-budget commercial movie with a moral purpose behind it these days something immoral in the viewer has to be not only assumed but addressed--and maybe even cultivated. The forthcoming Philadelphia about a gay lawyer is essentially addressed to homophobes. Likewise Schindlers List assumes a desire to identify with the class in power; it can only tell us what it has to say about Schindler by turning us into Schindler--which also means turning us into a Nazi. For all Spielbergs efforts to account for Schindlers actions by describing his growth as a spiritual conversion the mystery of the man and what he managed to do stubbornly remains. And when Schindler weeps for not having been able to do more--a scene that this movie has the brass to invent out of whole cloth--Im ready to weep with him.

Raimund Titsch an Austrian Catholic who managed a uniform factory within the Plaszow labor camp in Poland surreptitiously took pictures of what he saw. Fearful of having the pictures developed he hid his film in a steel box which he buried in a park outside Vienna and then did not disturb for nearly 20 years. Although it was sold secretly by Titsch when he was terminally ill the film remained undeveloped until after his death. The pictures that emerged like so many visual representations of the Holocaust are tragic ghostly and remote. The horrors of the Holocaust are often viewed from a similar distance filtered through memory or insulated by grief and recrimination. Documented exhaustively or dramatized in terms by now dangerously familiar the Holocaust threatens to become unimaginable precisely because it has been imagined so fully. But the film ""Schindlers List"" directed with fury and immediacy by a profoundly surprising Steven Spielberg presents the subject as if discovering it anew. ""Schindlers List"" brings a pre-eminent pop mastermind together with a story that demands the deepest reserves of courage and passion. Rising brilliantly to the challenge of this material and displaying an electrifying creative intelligence Mr. Spielberg has made sure that neither he nor the Holocaust will ever be thought of in the same way again. With every frame he demonstrates the power of the film maker to distill complex events into fiercely indelible images. ""Schindlers List"" begins with the sight of Jewish prayer candles burning down to leave only wisps of smoke and there can be no purer evocation of the Holocaust than that. A deserted street littered with the suitcases of those who have just been rounded up and taken away. The look on the face of a captive Jewish jeweler as he is tossed a handful of human teeth to mine for fillings. A snowy sky that proves to be raining ashes. The panic of a prisoner unable to find his identity papers while he is screamed at by an armed soldier a man with an obviously dangerous temper. These visceral scenes and countless others like them invite empathy as surely as Mr. Spielberg once made viewers wish E.T. would get well again. But this time his emphasis is on the coolly Kafkaesque aspects of an authoritarian nightmare. Drawing upon the best of his storytelling talents Mr. Spielberg has made ""Schindlers List"" an experience that is no less enveloping than his earlier works of pure entertainment. Dark sobering and also invigoratingly dramatic ""Schindlers List"" will make terrifying sense to anyone anywhere. The big man at the center of this film is Oskar Schindler a Catholic businessman from the Sudetenland who came to occupied Poland to reap the spoils of war. (You can be sure this is not the last time the words ""Oscar"" and ""Schindler"" will be heard together.) Schindler is also something of a cipher just as he was for Thomas Keneally whose 1982 book ""Schindlers List"" marked a daring synthesis of fiction and fact. Reconstructing the facts of Schindlers life to fit the format of a novel Mr. Keneally could only draw upon the memories of those who owed their lives to the mans unexpected heroism. Compiling these accounts (in a book that included some of the Titsch photographs) Mr. Keneally told ""the story of the pragmatic triumph of good over evil a triumph in eminently measurable statistical unsubtle terms."" The great strength of Mr. Keneallys book and now of Mr. Spielbergs film lies precisely in this pragmatism. Knowing only the particulars of Schindlers behavior the audience is drawn into wondering about his higher motives about the experiences that transformed a casual profiteer into a selfless hero. Schindlers story becomes much more involving than a tale of more conventional courage might be just as Mr. Spielbergs use of unfamiliar actors to play Jewish prisoners makes it hard to view them as stock movie characters (even when the real events that befall these people threaten to do just that). The prisoners stories come straight from Mr. Keneallys factual account which is beautifully recapitulated by Steven Zaillians screenplay. Oskar Schindler played with mesmerizing authority by Liam Neeson is unmistakably larger than life with the panache of an old-time movie star. (The real Schindler was said to resemble George Sanders and Curt Jurgens.) From its first glimpse of Oskar as he dresses for a typically flamboyant evening socializing with German officers -- and even from the way his hand appears nonchalantly holding a cigarette and a bribe -- the film studies him with rapt attention. Mr. Neeson captured so glamorously by Janusz Kaminiskis richly versatile black-and-white cinematography presents Oskar as an amalgam of canny opportunism and supreme well-warranted confidence. Mr. Spielberg does not have to underscore the contrast between Oskars life of privilege and the hardships of his Jewish employees. Taking over a kitchenware factory in Cracow and benefiting from Jewish slave labor Oskar at first is no hero. During a deft seamless section of the film that depicts the setting up of this business operation Oskar is seen happily occupying an apartment from which a wealthy Jewish couple has just been evicted. Meanwhile the films Jews are relegated to the Cracow ghetto. After the ghetto is evacuated and shut down they are sent to Plaszow which is overseen by a coolly brutal SS commandant named Amon Goeth. Goeth played fascinatingly by the English stage actor Ralph Fiennes is the films most sobering creation. The third of its spectacularly fine performances comes from Ben Kingsley as the reserved wary Jewish accountant who becomes Oskars trusted business manager and who at one point has been rounded up by Nazi officers before Oskar saves him. ""What if I got here five minutes later?"" Oskar asks angrily with the self-interest that keeps this story so startling. ""Then where would I be?"" As the glossy voluptuous look of Oskars sequences gives way to a stark documentary-style account of the Jews experience ""Schindlers List"" witnesses a pivotal transformation. Oskar and a girlfriend on horseback watch from a hilltop as the ghetto is evacuated and the image of a little girl in red seems to crystallize Oskars horror. But there is a more telling sequence later on when Oskar is briefly arrested for having kissed a young Jewish woman during a party at his factory. Kissing women is for Oskar the most natural act in the world. And he is stunned to find it forbidden on racial grounds. All at once he understands how murderous and irrational the world has become and why no prisoners can be safe without the intervention of an Oskar Schindler. The real Schindler saved more than a thousand Jewish workers by sheltering them in his factory and even accomplished the unimaginable feat of rescuing some of them from Auschwitz. This films moving coda a full-color sequence offers an unforgettable testimonial to Schindlers achievement. The tension in ""Schindlers List"" comes of course from the omnipresent threat of violence. But here again Mr. Spielberg departs from the familiar. The films violent acts are relatively few considering its subject matter and are staged without the blatant sadism that might be expected. Goeths hobby of playing sniper casually targeting his prisoners with a high-powered rifle is presented so matter-of-factly that it becomes much more terrible than it would be if given more lingering attention. Mr. Spielberg knows well how to make such events truly shocking and how to catch his audience off guard. Most of these shootings are seen from a great distance and occur unexpectedly. When it appears that the film is leading up to the point-blank execution of a rabbi the director has something else in store. Goeths lordly balcony which overlooks the films vast labor-camp set presents an extraordinary set of visual possibilities and Mr. Spielberg marshals them most compellingly. But the presence of huge crowds and an immense setting also plays to this directors weakness for staging effects en masse. ""Schindlers List"" falters only when the crowd of prisoners is reduced to a uniform entity so that events no longer have the tumultuous variety of real life. This effect is most noticeable in Schindlers last scene the films only major misstep as a throng listens silently to Oskars overwrought farewell. In a film that moves swiftly and urgently through its three-hour running time this stagey ending -- plus a few touches of fundamentally false uplift most notably in a sequence at Auschwitz -- amounts to a very small failing. Among the many outstanding elements that contribute to ""Schindlers List"" Michael Kahns nimble editing deserves special mention. So does the production design by Allan Starski which finds just the right balance between realism and drama. John Williamss music has a somber understated loveliness. The soundtrack becomes piercingly beautiful as Itzhak Perlmans violin solos occasionally augment the score. It should be noted if only in passing that Mr. Spielberg has this year delivered the most astounding one-two punch in the history of American cinema. ""Jurassic Park"" now closing in on billion-dollar grosses is the biggest movie moneymaker of all time. ""Schindlers List"" destined to have a permanent place in memory will earn something better. ""Schindlers List"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes violence and graphic nudity.

"Schindlers List (R) This movie won Oscars for Best Picture; Director (Steven Spielberg); Adapted Screenplay; Editing; Original Score; Cinematography; and Art Direction. Go to the ""Schindlers List"" Page Schindlers List (R) By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer December 17 1993 ""Schindlers List"" packs a punch all right the overwhelming wallop of six million Jews in general and more than a thousand so-called Schindler Jews in particular. Behind that punch is director Steven Spielberg for whom this three-hour black-and-white saga is a scorched-earth proving ground. For a movie -- or more accurately a Hollywood-approved art movie -- this often-stunning work puts the Holocaust into bracing perspective brings the filmmaker closer to his cultural roots and demonstrates his consummate movie-making abilities. But this heavy-hitting fist lands with calculated deliberation. Despite Spielbergs obviously genuine commitment ""Schindlers List"" feels strangely controlled -- more than impassioned. Its officially artistic an engineered project of pride Little Stevies growing-up project rather than an organically brilliant masterpiece. The movie based on the novelized biography by Thomas Keneally tells the real-life story of Oskar Schindler (played by Liam Neeson) a devil-may-care Nazi industrialist who yanked Polish Jews from the death machine to work in his enamelware factory in occupied Krakow. It was obvious to all that to be on Schindlers list was the difference between life and death. When the Nazis Final Solution led to the closure of the Plaszow forced-labor camp in Krakow and its sub-camps Schindler was obliged to relocate his factory to the safer Brinnlitz on the Polish-Czechoslovakian border. By now sensitized to the horrors of the Holocaust Schindler claimed to need more than 1100 Jews (today fondly known as Schindlerjuden) for his new munitions plant. He saved children by telling the Nazis only the young ones little hands could fit inside armament shells. By all indications (and the film is faithful to the book) Schindlers moral agenda was not easily fathomable. He started off apparently with his stated motive -- the need for free and motivated labor. He ended up as a conscientious savior. Under Spielbergs surface polish and within his artfully constructed sequences scriptwriter Steven Zaillian presents Schindlers slow-and-steady moral education. Neeson who imbues the role with believable presence starts off as a master of cigar-chomping hobnobbing with Nazis. With Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern (the wonderful Ben Kingsley) as his able production lieutenant Schindler becomes the compleat wartime industrialist -- a Citizen Schindler reaping enormous profit. This agenda brings him necessarily close to Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes in a mesmerizing evil manchild performance) commandant of the Plaszow camp. Schindler who has always instinctively steered clear of Nazi zealotry sees the darkest end of that spectrum in Goeth -- a man who shoots Jews from his balcony for pre-breakfast fun. In spite of his efforts to maintain a cool profitable head Schindlers protective attitude towards his workers becomes more than financially motivated. Spielbergs impressive abilities with set-piece filmmaking coupled with a subject as visceral as this make for some of the most jarringly effective moments of the year. In one heart-sinking scene female Schindlerjuden are diverted wrongly to Auschwitz-Birkenau through a clerical error. As they undergo the most harrowing experience of their lives Schindler works feverishly to secure their release. In another scene a Jewish woman forced to kneel before Goeths pistol delivers these touchingly defiant words ""Itll take worse than that."" During the wholesale slaughter of Jews in the walled-in Podgorze ghetto Nazis advance towards a hospital. Before they arrive the patients in a tender bedside pact with their doctors swallow suicide pills. You watch scenes like these and ask Is this a Spielberg movie? Overlooked repeatedly by a motion picture academy that does not believe box-office bankability and Academy Awards should be enjoyed in the same lifetime Spielberg has leapt into his post-""Jurassic Park"" vacuum with redemption-seeking vigor. The result is many things most of them good but ""Schindlers List"" is also an attempt to grasp two ""Oscars"" -- one called Schindler and the other a naked statuette with Spielbergs name on it.

"Schindlers List (R) This movie won Oscars for Best Picture; Director (Steven Spielberg); Adapted Screenplay; Editing; Original Score; Cinematography; and Art Direction. Go to the ""Schindlers List"" Page Schindlers List (R) By Rita Kempley Washington Post Staff Writer December 15 1993 ""Schindlers List"" is a ruthlessly unsentimental portrait of a German war profiteers epiphany that inspires neither sorrow nor pity but a kind of emotional numbness. Its as if Steven Spielberg so famous for emotional manipulation here has let the material speak for itself. The result is less than heart-rending. Like Thomas Keneallys novel Spielbergs adaptation takes a matter-of-fact approach to the horrific material. Its a faithful but foreshortened 3-hour 16-minute version of Keneallys biography of Oskar Schindler clinically scripted by Steven Zaillian the writer-director of ""Searching for Bobby Fischer."" By necessity Zaillian gives short shrift to many of the characters to focus on the protagonist Schindler (Liam Neeson) his accountant Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) and his tempter Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes). Schindler an industrialist who rescues more than 1100 Polish Jews from the death camps may consort with Nazis but at heart hes a Spielberg archetype a daredevil with the smarts of a fox and the heart of an angel -- only hes reluctant to acknowledge it. Schindler like the paleontologist of ""Jurassic Park"" or the marine biologist of ""Jaws"" is going about his business when he is hijacked by events and forced to confront his monsters. The Nazis of ""Schindlers List"" though make Spielbergs other monsters seem as innocent as the beasts of Eden. They turn killing into a sport and finally into a business as chillingly demonstrated by Goeth the savage commandant of the Plaszow forced-labor camp. Goeth liked to begin his morning with a little target practice. Standing on the balcony of his villa overlooking the camp he shoots random victims through the head. No shark ever showed less remorse. Schindler an enterprising businessman befriends Goeth and other SS officers in Krakow shortly after the German invasion in 1939. In a rowdy cabaret Schindler sizes up and seduces the power elite with a glad hand good French wines and a coterie of showgirls in net stockings. Then without remorse he takes over a confiscated enamelware plant and staffs it with slave labor -- Jewish refugees who are forced into the ghetto or worse. Stern who becomes his accountant and right-hand man builds the company into a major supplier of mess kits and cookware for troops at the front while Schindler strokes the German honchos. Meanwhile for the Jews conditions steadily deteriorate as Spielberg demonstrates in a frenetic series of quasi-documentary sequences that take the refugees from the ghetto where they were confined in 1941 to the Plaszow camp in 1942. Schindler an enigmatic sort absorbs the escalating brutality of the Nazis but it is hard to say just when his conscience finally kicks in. Spielberg attempts to clue in the audience when he adds an incongruous splash of red -- a tot in a scarlet coat -- to this otherwise black-and-white film. The child in red is pivotal in the book though the moment of epiphany remains ambiguous here. In any case Schindler becomes if not a saint then one of the righteous. With the help of Stern he befriends as many Jews as possible and when the Nazis threaten these ""essential workers"" he spends his last German mark to remove them to the relative safety of Brinnlitz. When the war ends the Schindlerjuden give him a ring inscribed with the Talmudic adage ""Whoever saves one life saves the world."" This would be an ideal ending but Spielberg like Spike Lee in ""Malcolm X"" doesnt quite know when to stop. Both Neeson and Spielberg step out of character in the first case to give a weepy melodramatic speech and Spielberg to add an epilogue that is soothing but more in keeping with ""The Color Purple."" All of a sudden hes pushing our buttons which he has thus far resisted so assiduously. The picture is complete without it even if it will send audiences away with a greater understanding of the inscription on Schindlers ring. ""Schindlers List"" reiterates much of what we already know about the Holocaust though there are some understated -- and so all the more macabre -- images such as when a child slashes his finger across his throat as the trains full of Jews rumble toward Auschwitz. There are many harrowing moments but Spielberg does not indulge in either self-righteousness or torturous excess much less his trademark schmaltz and special effects. The cartoon Nazis of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" are never in evidence. Some are as gentle as fathers while leading the little ones to their deaths. And Goeth is easily as complex as Schindler if something of a nutty Roman emperor as played by Fiennes. Kingsley is at his best as the quietly insistent accountant whose every scribble is directed at saving another life. And Schindler played with elan by Neeson is really a lot like Spielberg himself a man who manages to use his commercial clout to achieve a moral end. ""Schindlers List"" is rated R for violence nudity language and difficult subject matter.

"Schindlers List | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; schindler-s-list ) Schindlers List (United States 1993) A movie review by James Berardinelli There have been numerous documentaries and dramatic productions focusing on the Holocaust including a television mini-series which many consider to be the definitive work. As a result in deciding to film Schindlers List director Steven Spielberg (Jurassic Park) set an imposing task for himself. His vision needed to differ from that of the film makers who preceded him yet the finished product had to remain faithful to the unforgettable images which represent the legacy of six million massacred Jews. Those who see this motion picture will witness Spielbergs success. The film opens in September of 1939 in Krakow Poland with the Jewish community under increasing pressure from the Nazis. Into this tumult comes Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) a Nazi businessman interested in obtaining Jewish backing for a factory he wishes to build. He makes contact with Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) an accountant to arrange financial matters. For a while there is no interest and nothing happens. March 1941. The Krakow Jewish community has been forced to live in ""the Ghetto"" where money no longer has any meaning. Several elders agree to invest in Schindlers factory and the DEF (Deutsche Emailwarenfabrik) is born - a place where large quantities of pots are manufactured. To do the work Schindler hires Jews (because theyre cheaper than Poles) and the German army becomes his biggest customer. March 1943. Germanys intentions towards the Jews are no longer a secret. The Ghetto is ""liquidated"" with the survivors being herded into the Plaszow Forced Labor Camp. Many are executed and still others are shipped away by train never to return. During this time Schindler has managed to ingratiate himself with the local commander Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes) a Nazi who kills Jews for sport. Using his relationship with Goeth Schindler begins to secretly campaign to help the Jews saving men women and children from certain death. Spielberg elected to film this motion picture in black-and-white and its impossible to argue with his choice. Director of Photography Janusz Kaminski has made effective use of shadow and light meticulously limiting the application of hue. The opening scene is in color as is the closing sequence (which features the surviving ""Schindler Jews"" each accompanied by the actor who played their character placing a stone on their saviors grave). There are also two instances when color is allowed to bleed into the blacks whites and grays. One little girls jacket appears red so that she stands out from the masses and a pair of candles burn with orange flames. When color is used it makes a point and an impression. Schindlers List gives us three major stories and a host of minor ones. First and foremost it tells the tale of the Holocaust presenting new images of old horrors. These are as ghastly and realistic as anything previously filmed and Spielberg emphasizes the brutality of the situation by not pulling punches when it comes to gore. The blood inky rather than crimson in stark black-and-white fountains when men and women are shot in the head or through the neck. The second story is that of Oskar Schindler the Nazi businessman who saved 1200 Jews from death. Schindler starts out as a self-centered manufacturer concerned only about making money. He hires Jews because theyre cheap not because he likes them. But his perspective changes and he risks losing everything to save as many lives as he can. His eventual lament that he couldnt save more is heartbreaking. The third story belongs to Amon Goeth the Nazi commander of Krakow a man who teeters on the brink of madness. Despite his intense hatred for Jews he is inexplicably attracted to his Jewish housekeeper Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz). Disgusted by his feelings he lashes out at her with a display of violence that is almost Scorsese-like in its blunt presentation. As written Goeth could easily have become a conscienceless monster but Spielberg works carefully to show unexpected depth and complexity to his character. Often the experiences of the minor characters provide the most lasting images. Helens story is memorable as is the plight of young Danka Dresner and her mother as they strive to avoid death while staying together. Theres a Jewish couple that marries in the Plaszow camp even though their chances of survival are dim and a Rabbi who survives a close encounter with a Nazi gun. Of course the Holocaust images are grim but scenes of mass graves and exhumed bodies are not unique to Schindlers List. While its impossible to deny their power potentially more distubing are the instances of callous individual murder. Spielberg doesnt spare his audience when it comes to sudden violence or the dehumanizing factors involved in such events. After all Jews were viewed as ""vermin."" Schindlers List is replete with moments like this. The acting is uniformly excellent. Liam Neesons Schindler is shown in all his complexity and his transformation is played with studied control. This is no sudden reversal of philosophy but a matter of conscience that slowly dawns on the man. With a keen sense of Schindlers character Neeson depicts the metamorphosis from self-centered businessman to driven messiah. Ben Kingsley whose Gandhi transfixed audiences years ago has the movies most understated role -- one that he acts with simple sincerity. Equally as impressive is Embeth Davidtz who snares the viewers attention during her limited screen time as Helen Hirsch the object of Amon Goeths twisted affection. Speaking of Goeth Ralph Fiennes stuns with his intricate savage portrayal of the Nazi commander a man fascinated by power and murder. Fiennes Goeth has the rare ability to both mesmerize and repulse and this is a performance that will long be remembered. Despite the grisly subject matter this movie is essentially about uncovering a kernel of hope and dignity in the midst of a monstrous tragedy. The story of Oskar Schindlers sacrifices for the Jews sets this apart from other Holocaust dramas. Uncompromising in its portrayal of good evil and all the shades in between Schindlers List offers a clear view of human nature laid bare hatred greed lust envy anger and most important of all empathy and love. Because this film touches us so deeply the catharsis has a power that few -- if any -- other moments in film history can match. And thats what establishes this as a transcendent motion picture experience.
