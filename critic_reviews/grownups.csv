Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle The Miami Herald6/24/2010 Editor rating 2 Grown Ups is the perfect poster child for this maddening summer of movie mediocrity. Its not so hilarious that you need to rush to see it but not so bad that you will suffer unduly if you take a chance on its more-or-less family friendly charms (provided your family is up for crude jokes a running gag about breast-feeding a 4-year-old and an unnerving shot of a pants-free David Spade). On the grand scale of Adam Sandler movies -- and oh how grand that scale is -- Grown Ups registers as a middle-of-the-pack comedy not the instant classic of a Happy Gilmore or The Wedding Singer but not the heinous affront of Little Nicky. Its premise is slight Five junior-high buddies reunite for their basketball coachs funeral wives and kids in tow and reconnect with the simple pleasures of friendship constant insults and being whacked in the family jewels. Modest lessons at best but Lenny (Sandler) now a Hollywood agent wants his obnoxious offspring to put down their smart phones step away from the video games and skip some rocks on the lake damn it. He wants his glam designer wife (Salma Hayek) to forgo their planned trip to Milan to hang out with his buddies (Kevin James Chris Rock David Spade and Rob Schneider) and their families. That she agrees is a foregone conclusion but the greater mysteries -- what on Earth is Hayek doing in this movie and for that matter why is Maria Bello here too and who believes shed really be married to Kevin James? -- are left unanswered. Still the guys are more amusing than not and they display the easy chemistry of real-life pals. Sandler and Fred Wolf are credited with writing the screenplay but most of the sloppy dialogue in Grown Ups sounds as if the comedians are riffing on each others jokes. This approach doesnt always work but when it sputters there are still fragments of humor to sustain us providing you think its really funny for a guy to slam into a tree (I do actually). Theres also a great running gag about the guys most moronic childhood game ``arrow roulette which is pretty much what it sounds like and exactly the sort of idiotic activity adolescent boys are wont to try once theyve escaped adult supervision. In the end the movie is about having no regrets. Fortunately whether you decide to see it opening weekend wait for On Demand or ignore it altogether Grown Ups will keep your regrets to a minimum.

Or like Bill Murray (and to a lesser degree the Mike Myers of The Love Guru) do you pursue your muse even further into go-it-alone weirdness? Adam Sandler may have made his choice. After flirting with some fascinating sourness in Judd Apatows Funny People hes ready to sweeten up a bit; Grown Ups a benignly crude slice of family hysteria reunites him with ex-SNL-ers Chris Rock David Spade and Rob Schneider (plus obligatory chubster Kevin James) as former 12-year-old basketball teammates drawn together decades later when their coach kicks the bucket.Back to their old summer lodge they go along with several impossibly attractive wives - the breast-feeding Maria Bello; a quietly dominating Maya Rudolph; high-strung fashion fiend Salma Hayek Pinault (who?) - plus a swarm of carefully written kids destined to wise up in the great outdoors. No viewer goes into this movie expecting John Cassavetess Husbands least of all from soft-serve director Denis Dugan (You Dont Mess with the Zohan). But would it have been such a crushing blow to these stars egos if theyd accommodated a little honest anxiety instead of the typical lake-rope-swinging mishaps and an inevitable Steve Buscemi cameo? Telegraphed down to the final shot of a basketball contest Grown Ups suggests a mask being torn off to reveal another one the male fantasy of cheerleader spouse well-adjusted kids and expanding waistline.

Reuniting 1990s ""Saturday Night Live"" castmates Adam Sandler David Spade Rob Schneider and Chris Rock (with Kevin James filling in for Chris Farley and Tim Meadows making a cameo) ""Grown Ups"" delivers precious few laughs for the sheer volume of comedy talent on offer. Softer and more family values-oriented than virtually anything that rowdy crowd have done solo this star-stuffed venture should play especially well in places where ""Wild Hogs"" made a killing while resuscitating the eroding B.O. of co-writer-producer Sandlers recent oeuvre. With no reward to show for tapping into the more personal vulnerable side of himself in ""Funny People"" Sandler chooses to kick back and crack wise with old friends in a loosely scripted summer-vacation comedy overseen by longtime conspirator Dennis Dugan. The tame (to the point of toothless) result feels like the sort of movie Sandlers ""Funny People"" character might have made after surviving his near-death bout with cancer. The five actors play one-time teammates first seen as gawky teenage versions of themselves winning a basketball championship in 1978. Flash forward 30 years to find each tied up in the petty concerns of his adult life. It seems inspirational ""Coach Buzzer"" (Blake Clark) couldnt have kicked the bucket at a better time his passing giving the pals a much-needed excuse to catch up at the lake house where they spent their formative years. As Lenny Feder Sandler is the groups ringleader a rich and powerful talent agent with none of the abrasive traits that accompany the profession in real life (his BlackBerry makes just one appearance all weekend). Lenny is married to a fashion-designer wife (Salma Hayek Pinault) saddled with three silver-spoon kids (Jake Goldberg Cameron Boyce and Alexys Nycole Sanchez) and mildly embarrassed about the full-time nanny (Di Quon) they employ -- not a particularly strong case of someone needing to have his priorities readjusted. The others are less successful but relatively happy as well ranging from lawn-furniture mogul Eric Lamonsoff (James) whose wife (Maria Bello) still breast-feeds his 4-year-old son to stay-at-home dad Kurt McKenzie (Rock) who has his hands full with two kids a pregnant spouse (Maya Rudolph) and her flatulent mother-in-law (Ebony Jo-Ann). Spade plays career bachelor Marcus Higgins who gamely earns the pics PG-13 rating by baring his backside while touchy-feely vegan Rob Hilliard (Schneider) is on his fourth marriage to a woman (Joyce Van Patten) old enough to be funnier than the jokes about her age suggest. Sandler and co-writer Fred Wolf spread the humiliation evenly among the cast generously giving each actor a chance to pursue laughs at the expense of his own dignity (targets range from James weight to Schneiders bad pompadour toupee). The five comedians seem to be having a grand time of it and Dugan spends nearly as much time filming them laughing at one another as he does on the jokes themselves leaving the distinct impression that a behind-the-scenes documentary of the ""SNL"" reunion might have been far more entertaining than watching the same actors catch up in character. Apart from the constant barrage of insults the comics throw at one another (most of which were probably ad-libbed along the way) the script feels pretty slack. Clearly designed to reinforce a certain blue-collar status quo pic offers few insights into the sort of professional parental or relationship crises real adults face reinforcing the suspicion that ""Grown Ups"" target aud isnt grown-ups at all. With no real conflict to speak of apart from a no-stakes rematch with the team they beat all those years ago (captained by fellow ""SNL"" vet Colin Quinn) ""Grown Ups"" gives these real-life friends a chance to reconnect with not only one another but also the all-American values (beer boobs BBQ and sports) celebrated every Fourth of July across the country with a loony Steve Buscemi cameo and plenty of gratuitous objectification thrown in for good measure (in the form of Robs preposterously leggy daughters for the guys and ""Water Park Stud"" Alec Musser for the ladies). For all their good-natured squabbling the characters in ""Grown Ups"" are so ready to make peace with each other the film can hardly get to its group-hug scene fast enough. The result is easily the safest and least subversive Happy Madison comedy released in the two decades since these guys started on ""SNL"" (especially after such risky Dugan-Sandler ventures as Israeli super-spy satire ""You Dont Mess With the Zohan"" and gay-marriage sendup ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry""). Had the core foursome pledged to reteam 20 years later ""Grown Ups"" certainly isnt the project they had in mind.

Grown Ups Sandler does friends no favors in Grown Ups BY JOE WILLIAMS  Post-Dispatch Film Critic  joewilliamspost-dispatch.com  314-340-8344 Jun 25 2010 (...) Tracy Bennett The guys come back from the dock and see Rob Hilliards daughter who has arrived at the Lake House. Kurt (Chris Rock) Eric (Kevin James) with a KFC bucket on his head Rob (Rob Schneider) Marcus (David Spade) Lenny (Adam Sandler). The guys cant believe the beautiful blonde is Robs daughter. Being friends with Adam Sandler is a double-edge pie in the face. You get lifetime job security with supporting roles in his hit comedies but your character is liable to be peed upon socked in the genitals or shot through the foot with an arrow.And while your other friends are laughing Sandler will pretend to make it all better by declaring ""Im just messin with you.""Sandlers humor has always hidden a deep vein of contempt but in the loathsome ""Grown Ups"" its hacked open to spew onto everyone in sight. So when five old pals reunite for the funeral of their basketball coach the initial pleasantries include ""Your kids are fat"" ""Your wife is old"" and ""Your mother-in-law is fat and old and smells like a flatulent water buffalo."" Nobody escapes unscathed except of course for Sandler who co-wrote the infantile screenplay.He plays Lennie ""the most powerful agent in Hollywood"" and the envy of his friends patio-furniture manufacturer Eric (Kevin James) henpecked househusband Kurt (Chris Rock) new-age healer Rob (Rob Schneider) and deadbeat Marcus (David Spade). But poor Lennie has two spoiled sons and a fashion-designer wife (Salma Hayek) who wants to jet off to Milan the next day so hes the character were supposed to identify with while he extols ""normal"" food and ""normal"" fun to the freakish families whove rented a lake house for the occasion. Even by Sandlers lax standards the boob and fart jokes are unusually stupid and actors whove been funny in larger roles are relegated to laughing at lame insults. (Chris Rock call your agent.)It takes a peculiar kind of teamwork to produce such a steady stream of excrement. With friends like these who needs enemas?

Just watch Add to ... Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jun. 25 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 312PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Grown Ups Directed by Dennis Dugan Written by Adam Sandler and Fred Wolf Starring Adam Sandler Chris Rock Kevin James Classification PG The last time he graced the big screen in Funny People Adam Sandler played a literally sick comic who hates not just himself but Adam Sandler movies too - yep all those high-grossing low-grade yuk fests that had made him very rich. Now after that brief time out for a breath of honesty Adam is back to lining his pockets again. No need to dwell on the thing except to say that the grown-ups who will love Grown Ups must also love this Five relatively smart comedians - Sandler Chris Rock Kevin James David Spade and (okay cut me some slack here) Rob Schneider - dumbing way down to play the usual gaggle of middle-aged goofballs lobbing gags they surely disdain at an audience they probably despise while reserving their own laughter for that off-camera dash all the way to the bank. Said goofballs gather their families for a reunion in a rustic cottage by a quiet lake where they soon get down to a game of ""arrow roulette"" Shoot the pointy thing straight up in the air watch it plunge down to pierce an unsuspecting foot. Repeat. Foot humour redux. An old fat black woman removes her sensible brogues to reveal a vast outcropping of fungal growth prompting this escalating trio of jibes (1) ""I didnt know the Elephant Man lived in your shoe""; (2) ""Would you like bunion rings with that?""; (3) ""Toe J. Simpson."" A requisite climb up the anatomy for the always popular fart joke the blast provided by the same old fat black woman. Blame it on the dog. Repeat. A deft switch to the urinary tract. A guy takes a leak from a canoe; other guys comment on the sad decline of his once-potent stream. Later all five guys take their sad declines to a swimming pool where their collective relief stains the water (and their comedy) a Crayola shade of blue. Fat humour redux. A tubby fellow on water skis signals the driver of the boat to gun it. Engine roars boat doesnt move. Close-up of dog poo. Medium shot of mans face falling in slow motion toward the dog poo. Splat. Repeat. More anatomical delights. Aforementioned middle-aged goofballs peek longingly at the taut behind of a teenage girl. The scene requires the peepers to feel guilty clearly a feat of acting far beyond the range of this group. The comely wife of one middle-aged goofball casually exposes a breast to feed her thirsty son. Her thirsty four-year old son. Repeat and repeat and repeat. The certain knowledge that in the eyes of the grown-ups who made Grown Ups we at the box office are that four-year-old kid permanently infantilized and indiscriminately hungry.

It was easy to assume that the PG-13 comedy ""Grown Ups"" starring Adam Sandler and an able posse of funnymen is really for teens. And there are plenty of young ones running around this guffaw-filled if slight romp about a group of guys who return -- mates and kids in tow -- to their hometown when an adored basketball coach dies. But the not-quite-R comedy written by Sand ler and Fred Wolf turns out to be made for adults tussling with the complications of midlife success and crises by adults wrestling with comedys adolescent vs. adult tensions. Its a crude and decent-hearted outing -- and yes the adolescent still wins out. To have an intimate mourning ceremony Hollywood agent Lenny rents a lake house where the friends were feted as basketball champions 30 years earlier. The guys have gone their separate ways. The intervening years have been generous to some stingy with others. All however feel indebted to their coachs last pep talk. You know the one from the dog-eared playbook about having no regrets when the final buzzer blares. Still the films draw isnt its ""Big Chill"" setup. Its the stars who play the childhood friends Sandler as Lenny Kevin James as lawn-furniture king Eric Chris Rock as house-herr Kurt David Spade as the wastrel Marcus and Rob Schneider as sensitive freak Rob. Most of the fun comes from the fast quips and sight gags the agile crew delights in. Like the friends they portray the performers appear to get a kick out of one another. If they dont thats the movies best acting. The women playing the spouses -- Salma Hayek Pinault Maria Bello and Maya Rudolph -- dont have as many zingers but they get how timing works. Lenny is hitched to successful designer Roxanne (Pinault). Their sons are demanding brats who text their nanny their lazy demands. Daughter Becky (Alexys Nycole Sanchez) is the movies true innocent and cutest onscreen tyke. Lennys pressing dilemma cutting short the coachs rites to jet to fashion week in Milan. While Lennys family is the most fleshed-out (being writer-star-producer has its privileges) the other friends have their twists. Eric is vying with a still-suckling 4-year-old for quality time with wife Sally (Bello). Kurts torment is his mother-in-law. As Mama Ronzini Ebony Jo-Anns performance suggests what might happen if Tyler Perrys alter ego Madea Dr. Maya Angelou and Aretha Franklin (or at least her taste in hats) were put in comedys Cuisnart. Still its Rob (Schneider) and Marcus (Spade) who bear the brunt of lifes disappointments. Marcus is an undisciplined drinker and a serial dater. Pompadour-wearing over-emoting Rob has love in his life. Only his old lady Gloria (Joyce Van Patten) has had an AARP card for decades. Not surprisingly given the hardly-secret formula theres a rekindled rivalry between the guys and their hard-court adversaries of yore. Colin Quinn Steve Buscemi and Tim Meadows arrive on the scene as the rivals grown up (sort of) and grown bitter (""we waz robbed""). Like many a comedy banking on the known charms of its cast ""Grown Ups"" is easy breezy predictable. Little sticks once the credits roll. But it does have a goodly share of silly giggles and moronic laughs. The good news Not all of them were in the preview trailer. ""GROWN UPS."" PG-13 for crude material including suggestive references language and some male rear nudity. 1 hour 42 minutes.

Sandler and Rock can be pretty funny. James is at least affable. Spade and Schneider are friends with Sandler Rock and James so theyre in the movie too. Networking It works.Whats it about? Absolutely nothing at least not in the conventional sense of story and plotting. Our five amigos playing bundles of broad traits disguised as actual characters gather for a long weekend at a New England lakeside cabin after the death of their beloved CYO basketball coach. (Moment of silence.) They share boob jokes because nothing brings down the house like a 4-year-old boy who still breast-feeds (Maria Bello youre so much better than this). They smack each other around with food and they urinate in a swimming pool. They realize that just because theyre getting older doesnt mean they have to get smarter. Movie Information Grown UpsRatingShowtimes | Official siteDirector Dennis DuganStarring Adam Sandler Chris Rock Salma Hayek Maya Rudolph Kevin James David Spade and Rob SchneiderRun time 102 minutesMPAA rating PG-13 (language brief nudity adult content mass idiocy)Synopsis Five former teammates - Adam Sandler Kevin James Chris Rock Rob Schneider and David Spade - reunite.More movies from GuideLive.comThis is the part where you say ""Relax its just a mindless comedy."" True an Adam Sandler movie about immaturity is a time-worn formula. Hes made a handsome career playing up arrested development from Happy Gilmore to take your pick. Hes a walking celebration of our inner idiot man-child. But Grown Ups feels the need to showcase a more sensitive Sandler. He wants his spoiled kids to turn off their video games and go play outside. Because when they do they cease being little monsters. Thats what passes for story in Grown Ups.I get the whole ""boys being boys"" thing. Give me Get Him to the Greek and The Hangover and Im good for days. Those are smart comedies about guys doing stupid stuff.Grown Ups by contrast is a baggy PG-13 trash-talk session that has the gall to act as if its saying something important. Growing up is hard to do. But if you stay juvenile crank up the Aerosmith and toss around some flatulence jokes then maybe you can stay forever young. Nothing defeats stupidity like sentimentality.No movie with Maya Rudolph can be a complete waste of time though she has to steal her laughs in an anemic role as Rocks wife. Salma Hayek plays Sandlers fashionista spouse who also discovers that a weekend by the lake can completely transform ones personality. Joyce Van Patten has some fun as Schneiders septuagenarian lover. Because elderly sex is like funny and stuff.But Grown Ups isnt bad because its offensive. Its bad because its not funny. Its as if the stars expect laughs based on their reputations and proximity to each other despite the day-old feel of the material. Someone - everyone? - forgot that the jokes have to actually work. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

Pratfalls and bathroom humor are likely to be the order of the day in this story of reunited childhood friends (Adam Sandler Kevin James Chris Rock David Spade and Rob Schneider). Starring Adam Sandler Kevin James Chris Rock Rob Schneider Steve Buscemi Salma Hayek Maria Bello David Spade Director Dennis Dugan Release Opened Jun 25 2010  Editorial Review Nothing fresh in this bro-mideBy Ann HornadayFriday June 25 2010Wait is this the right movie? ""Grown Ups"" a summer male-bonding comedy starring Adam Sandler purports to be about a successful man in his 40s dealing with rue and regret with bittersweet laughs and maybe a few tears along the way. But thats what Sandler did in last summers ""Funny People"" which was a whole lot funnier and about actual recognizable human people.What a difference a year makes. ""Grown Ups"" finds Sandler reverting to lunkheaded lazy-laff form as a Hollywood super-agent named Lenny who reunites with his childhood friends after the funeral of their revered basketball coach. The lineupTheres Eric (Kevin James) the fat-joke target who makes his screen entrance by breaking the side of an inflatable pool and unleashing a backyard tsunami drives a Cadillac and has a pretty wife (Maria Bello) who still breast-feeds their 4-year-old son. Kurt (Chris Rock) is a househusband married to a tart-tongued career woman (Maya Rudolph); Rob (Rob Schneider) is a New Age massage therapist married to a much older woman (Joyce Van Patten); and Marcus (David Spade) is the groups skeevy-looking Peter Pan who has a dirty aside or bitter put-down for every occasion.With its lame guys-doing-guy-stuff humor ""Grown Ups"" resembles the bro-centric action picture ""The A-Team"" except that nothing blows up -- unless you count a flatulent mother-in-law (which is only one of several sexist jokes that immediately wear thin). And if you find that hilarious youll just love stunts involving James flying head-first into a tree Spade falling head-first into a pile of mud and an arrow going head-first into Schneiders foot. (Oh and Steve Buscemi shows up to slam head-first into a wall resulting in several shots of him in a body cast.)From each obvious setup to its hoary payoff ""Grown Ups"" hews faithfully to its formula which is concocted mostly as a way for Sandlers alter ego to have his cake and eat it in the form of reveling in his material success while taking a few moments to question his own values. (He even gets the prettiest girl Salma Hayek plays his wife looking as if shes desperately seeking the set of ""30 Rock"" to do some real comedy.)After the requisite insults slapstick sight gags and male ogling -- especially after two comely 20-somethings show up -- ""Grown Ups"" ends with a tiresome grudge match on the basketball court in which Lenny Teaches Everyone a Lesson in What Really Matters. In its own hackneyed way the scene perfectly sums up just how smug and self-congratulatory the movie has been all along.Contains crude material including suggestive references profanity and male rear nudity.

When ""Grown Ups"" star and co-writer Adam Sandler repeatedly slapped Rob Schneider in the face with a dehydrated banana I was jealous of Schneider who suffered less than I did getting slapped upside the head by this rotting fruit of a comedy. Those two plus David Spade Kevin James and Chris Rock play former schoolboy basketball buddies who gather for the funeral of their coach and follow up with a reunion/vacation with their families at a New England lakeside cabin. Each character is tagged with a slender basis for slapstick Schneider is a New Age vegan who likes older women (""This must be your mom?"" ""Shes my wife"") James suffers from a urinary malaise that reflects the way feeble jokes dribble over the script Spade is supposedly a lady-killer Rock is a househusband and Sandler wants his adolescent boys to put down their cellphones and reconnect with nature. PHOTOS ADAM SANDLERS LEADING LADIES The bizarre pratfalls (Schneiders foot gets an arrow shot through it yet no one takes him to the hospital; James swings on a rope until he crashes into a tree yet laughs it off) and boring running gags (an overprotective mom breastfeeds her 4-year-old son a mother-in-law has an ugly bunion and farts) dont even belong in a movie. Theyre of the caliber youd expect to find only in the places where broad comedy goes to make sweaty desperate pleas for lowbrow laffs like the sitcoms found on obscure cable channels and CBS. How desperate is ""Grown Ups""? At one point it pauses and all but begs for applause as the guys proudly hoist an American flag. I momentarily wished for a Canadian birth certificate. The movie couldnt be more pathetic if it hired clowns to dash through the audience tossing handfuls of candy and gum. Sandler who wears T-shirts providing shout-outs to New Englands most mediocre schools (UNH UConn Harvard) forgot to even give himself a real character. At the outset hes a ferocious showbiz super-agent but minutes later hes a generic mellow caring dad. A few hours in the cabin and the dull major conflicts are resolved -- Sandlers tech-obsessed kids learn to skip stones and even his designer-label-clad wife (Salma Hayek) changes into ordinary jeans and a tourist T-shirt. So the movie throws in a dull grudge match between the five friends and the guys who once played on a rival basketball team. Schneiders quiff of a toupee flaps in the breeze James yuks it up (twice) with a Kentucky Fried Chicken bucket on his head Spade strolls bare-butted Steve Buscemi shows up for no reason except to get thrown through a wall. Guys ogle hot girls guys pee in pools and we learn that we should make the most of existence -- ""before lifes final buzzer."" The only mercy on offer is that despite several scenes spent in the water James keeps his shirt on. Sandler (whose much sharper early comedies were unjustly maligned by critics) can be an interesting writer and actor but whenever he gets spooked by the reception of grown-up work like last years ""Funny People"" he becomes Hollywoods real-life Billy Madison -- skulking off to the least challenging path. In response I was aching for a real-life ""Click"" so I could fast-forward through the nullity and get on with my life. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next American viewership of Team USA World Cup games jumps 68 p...

"Grown Ups movie review Adam Sandler gathers with buddies for latest ode to immaturity |       NJ.com comments Grown Ups movie review Adam Sandler gathers with buddies for latest ode to immaturity Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on June 25 2010 at 1217 AM View/Post Comments Tracy BennettFrom left childhood buddies played by Rob Schneider Chris Rock Kevin James Adam Sandler and David Spade reunite 30 years after their championship basketball game in the comedy ""Grown Ups."" Youve heard about Hollywoods A-list and B-list. Adam Sandler keeps track of both. The top-notch guys -- Judd Apatow Paul Thomas Anderson James L. Brooks -- are the directors he works with when every couple of years he feels like ""stretching."" The mediocrities -- theyre the dull dependable whatever-you-say-Adam NYU buds he calls up whenever he wants to shovel out a stupid who-cares comedy to the masses. Sure Brooks can give him a ""Spanglish."" Anderson can turn out a ""Punch-Drunk Love."" But who else but Frank Coraci can produce time-wasters like ""Click"" and ""The Waterboy""? And is there anyone besides Steven Brill who could helm disasters like ""Mr. Deeds"" and ""Little Nicky""? So its not a good sign that with ""Grown Ups"" the comic has returned to his favorite grinning go-fer -- Dennis Dugan a dull director now making his fourth Sandler yukfest. And the result is a disappointment even for the auteur of ""You Dont Mess With the Zohan."" The plot a kind of sixth-grade takeoff on ""That Championship Season"" has five guys gathering 30 or so years after a winning basketball game to toast their departed coach and catch up on each others lives. Cue the confessions of business reverses broken marriages and brats -- punctuated of course by kicks to the crotch pervy gags about breast-feeding Chris Rock as a feminized house husband and David Spade naked. Movie Review Grown Ups (PG-13) Columbia (102 min.) Directed by Dennis Dugan. With Adam Sandler Kevin James Rob Schneider Chris Rock David Spade. Now playing in New Jersey. Ratings note The film contains endless bathroom ""humor"" and tiresomely ""comic"" violence. Stephen Whittys review ONE AND A HALF STARS Give Sandler points for loyalty. The man who was unceremoniously shown the door at ""Saturday Night Live"" has developed a real buddy-buddy bonding with lesser comics. Thats to be lauded. But it doesnt make Rob Schneider bearable and it doesnt make Spade funny. Not that anyone has much to work with. The script credited to -- or better blamed on -- Sandler and collaborator Fred Wolf never builds. In fact it mostly consists of the comics cracking each other up. And its not a party were ever invited to. The jokes are strictly out of adolescence and the locker room (old women are disgusting grown women are nags young women in tiny shorts are really really hot.) And the scripts assumptions -- that Salma Hayek and Maria Bello would naturally marry men like Sandler and Kevin James that terminally screwed-up children can be fixed by a quick weekend of ""quality time"" -- are the only funny things in the film. Hayek looks terrific and Joyce Van Patten -- as Schneiders senior-citizen lover -- is game. So is Maya Rudolph -- here playing Rocks wife -- although ... wait. Didnt she used to have a mole next to her eye? She doesnt now. Is somebody stealing moles in Hollywood? Is it the same fiend who robbed Sarah Jessica Parker? But that detail was just a distraction -- and a desperately needed one -- from the problems at hand. Which is that for a comedy called ""Grown Ups"" this movie was neither comic nor adult. And that if this is from one of Sandlers B-talents -- well Id hate to see who didnt make the grade.

"Movie review Grown Ups - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-JokesMovie review Grown UpsCo-writer and costar Adam Sandler teams with Chuck amp; Larry director Dennis Dugan for a middling comedy about childhood friends who reunite.June 25 2010|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Whoever said the road to hell is paved with good intentions probably got an early look at ""Grown Ups."" The new Adam Sandler comedy has all the charm of a home movie that does not star your own family which means its overly sentimental filled with you-had-to-be-there moments bad jokes and even worse camera angles. Its also far too long and an excellent reminder of why most of us spare our friends this sort of share.Written by Sandler and Fred Wolf who cut his teeth at ""Saturday Night Live"" in the 90s and directed by frequent Sandler partner in crime Dennis Dugan (""I Now Pronounce You Chuck amp; Larry"" most recently) the film is clearly a case of a comic on a nostalgia binge pining for a simpler place and time. And hes taken his best funny buddies a Kevin James Chris Rock David Spade and Rob Schneider a along for the ride.The script is very little story very long joke list which makes for very rough going on the pacing and delivery front since this is allegedly a film not open-mike night at the Improv. The plot trying to make room for all those one-liners is a universal one small town boys grow up together then grow apart and into very different grown-up lives only to be brought back together years later so they can rediscover what they remember as the greatest moment in their lives.In this case its a basketball championship and the death of the beloved basketball coach who led this once gangly crew to a noble victory. In their grown-up versions Sandler has cast himself as a top Hollywood agent and by far the most successful which I guess is the case. James is technically a lawn furniture salesman but his primary role is to be the punch line for an endless litany of fat jokes even though he looks to be at his lightest in years; Rock is a stay-at-home dad with a fussy Food Channel jones; and Spade is the drunk single man forever on the make.The surprise of the movie and there arent many is Schneider. He plays completely against type as a New Age philosopher-massage therapist in a May-December relationship where hes May and the most sensitive restrained one of the bunch with nary a cutting remark. Except for the very bad toupee the whole renaissance man thing is a good look on Schneider though it also means he bears the brunt of the good humor boys. (I should note that in another test of the ""suspension of disbelief"" principle Salma Hayek is cast as Sandlers wife.)The film is a very wistful one with Sandlers Lenny Feder worried that his kids are so far removed from the real world a with the texting and the Wii-ing and the nanny seeing to all their needs a that they dont even know how to skip a stone. He wants to re-create for them the sort of childhood he remembers and the coachs death makes that possible.A lake house where the team celebrated that championship season 20 years ago is rented for the funeral weekend and the boys to men come back with their wives kids and a lot of emotional baggage in tow. That baggage is mostly laid out in jokes that accompany the barbecues canoeing marshmallow roasts rope swinging deck-chair sitting water-park sliding that passes for action here. Though some of the humor is a bit off-color (the pool turns blue when anyone pees in it and someone does a lot) it all seems mild; a throwback in an era ruled by raunchy comedy. Even the fart joke (or at least one of them) is delivered by the old cup-and-string phone method.Since the coach had a great sense of timing his passing brings them back home for July 4. But most of the fireworks come in the form of the rival team which still holds a grudge and turns up in all the local haunts demanding a rematch. Meanwhile theres a lot of catching up to do.

"Grown Ups Grown older and grosser but not wiser | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesGrown Ups Grown older and grosser but not wiserAdam Sandler and his comedy pals had a chance to show how their comedy has matured along with their ages. Instead they continue to act like spoiled children.Chris Rock left David Spade Kevin James Rob Schneider and Adam Sandler in the supremely unfunny Grown Ups.  (HANDOUT)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. June 24 2010Grown Ups (out of 4)Starring Adam Sandler Chris Rock Kevin James Rob Schneider David Spade Salma Hayek and Maria Bello. Directed by Dennis Dugan. 142 minutes. At major theatres. PGWhen rock stars grow old and fade they often resort to touring with other has-been howlers hoping each act will attract enough fans for a reasonable facsimile of an audience.Its much the same desperation that brings us what might just be the summers worst movie no small feat in a season already reeking of foul cinematic emissions.Article Continued BelowThe film is Grown Ups which has a title you must not equate with maturity. It features (""stars"" is too generous) four Saturday Night Live alumni all now firmly in their 40s who used to be considered comedy gold Adam Sandler Chris Rock Rob Schneider and David Spade. The first three havent had an unqualified hit in a while and Spade has been MIA for so long his role should be advertised on the side of milk cartons.Grown Ups also features one guy Kevin James who actually still has a viable career on the strength of last years surprise hit Mall Cop. James has evidently decided to risk his fragile popularity by engaging in this appalling mess with his fellow boy-men which gets him points for loyalty if not for career smarts.The slim conceit of the picture is five pals from a 1978 school basketball championship team who reunite at a lake house 30 years later their families in tow following the funeral of their beloved coach.This is a five-in-one deal you definitely want to refuse. Directed by obedient hack Dennis Dugan Grown Ups comes from Sandlers ramshackle laugh factory which wheezes out product even when no one is buying as is increasingly the case. Its evident that Sandler couldnt even be bothered to write the script hes credited to having penned with Joe Dirt scribe Fred Wolf. No discernible effort went into the assembling of this witless series of juvenile and frequently offensive gags which are set against an insipid soundtrack of cut-rate pop ditties (""The Pina Colada Song"" anyone?)Three general rules were obviously in effect on this Boyz R Us movie set (a) Any joke that entered anyones head would be used no matter how old lame or gross it might be; (b) no topics especially sexist and racist ones would be considered off-limits; and (c) any gag once belched or farted out would be repeated numerous times until even the most tolerant viewer would feel like screaming as Schneiders character does at one point ""Grow up will ya""Schneiders character cleverly called Rob plays the closest thing to an adult amongst these stooges which isnt saying much. Hes become a New Ager embracing the Earth vegan food and a devoted wife who is significantly older than him (the indulgent Joyce Van Patten).Sandler is Lenny a Hollywood super agent with a fashionista spouse (Salma Hayek) incredibly bratty kids and the usual Sandler mugging minus any hilarity. Rock is henpecked househusband Kurt who is bullied by his pregnant wife (Maya Rudolph). James is lawn furniture mogul Eric who has embarrassing prostate problems (no details are spared) and a nice but nutty wife (Maria Bello) who still breast-feeds their 4-year-old son (ditto on the details). This leaves Spades pathetic Marcus who readily demonstrates why he still hasnt found a woman willing to tolerate him.Needless to say no female of any age escapes leering or crude jokes and this includes Ebony Jo-Ann who plays Rocks foul and flatulent mother-in-law.Did it never occur to any of these booger flickers that they actually had the germ of a good idea here? Watching this pack of elderly juveniles reluctantly adjust to middle age could have been funny and even a little poignant. Instead theyve chosen to portray themselves as pathetic losers who never have and never will grow up and thats not much to laugh about.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

(Columbia Pictures/Everett Collection) Joe Neumaier Thursday June 24 2010 300 PM Title Grown Ups The minimal enjoyment to be found in ""Grown Ups"" doesnt come from its five male stars acting childish or fighting desperately against age. It comes from the easy camaraderie among Adam Sandler Kevin James and Chris Rock as well as charity cases Rob Schneider and David Spade.Unfortunately theres a movie surrounding them and it forces them to have dilemmas and family confabs and us to endure countless fart jokes and booyah groin hits. After a promising start the sophomoric side of Dennis Dugans fi lm wins in an upset.Lenny (Sandler) Eric (James) Kurt (Rock) Rob (Schneider) and Marcus (Spade) have been friends since grade school and are brought together again in their early 40s for the funeral of their old basketball coach. Theyve grown up to become respectively a hotshot Hollywood producer a blue-collar salesman a sensitive husband a New Age freak and a horndog bachelor. While at their former New England campground they try to recapture the thing that made 1978 so wonderful. What was it again? Oh right ""youth"".But thats hard to do with the families and wives (underused Maria Bello Salma Hayek and Maya Rudolph) around. Still the guys inevitably face one-time rivals connect with their own championship season and teach their kids lessons in old-fashioned non-Wii fun.Unlike the recent and better ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" ""Grown Ups"" is just playing at being worried about things; theres no real dismay or anger in Sandler and Fred Wolfs script though as the point man here Sandler shows the most maturity. ( As with last years ""Funny People"" it appears the ""SNL"" goofballturned-megastar has some issues with his success Lenny is embarrassed because his sons have a nanny and his fashion-designer wife has a huge wardrobe.) And the actors rapport can sometimes be its own reward. Like when theyre all trying to not check out a sexy girl or having late-night bull sessions ; Sandler James and Rock can easily charm us. Schneider and Spade fans -- all six of you -- may be happy to see them too.Yet the movie devolves into a series of cliched bits none of which are that funny and when elements of Sandlers more outrageous comedies creep in the mixture of those with the old-fashioned Americana doesnt gel. Not to mention that the lets-hang-while-making-a-movie attitude really wears thin around the time we get to an endless water-park visit. It looks like everyone had a good time making ""Grown Ups.""

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Theres a practice among stand-up comedians called ""emptying the notebook."" Its a housecleaning exercise in which they get together read off the jokes that didnt fly and toss away the index cards to start writing afresh. ""Grown Ups"" apparently was launched when someone thought they should use the discarded jokes to make a movie. Uniting the creative forces behind ""Paul Blart Mall Cop"" ""The Hot Chick"" and ""Dickie Roberts Former Child Star"" the latest offering from Adam Sandlers production company is ""The Big Chill"" for morons. This bone-lazy film is a comedy only if you believe Kevin James falling off a rope swing is funny. Thirty years after junior high five basketball teammates reunite for a getaway weekend at a lakeside cabin in New England. (""New England"" is the onscreen description and an indication of the finely honed screenwriting on tap here.) Sandler James Rob Schneider Chris Rock and David Spade bring their families who consist of problematic wives and troublesome kids. Salma Hayek partnered with Sandler plays a high-powered fashion designer; their kids are over-entitled brats who shudder at the notion of drinking unbottled non-designer water. Maria Bello much to James chagrin is still breastfeeding their 4-year-old son. Sweet-tempered Joyce Van Patten plays Schneiders senior-citizen wife; through some miracle of genetics he has two supermodel daughters from earlier marriages. Maya Rudolph is the bossy breadwinner to Rocks househusband; their pubescent son ogles Schneiders hottie girls. Spade continues to play the smarmy Lothario bachelor. Longtime Sandler collaborator Dennis Dugan directs to the extent that turning the camera on and off can be considered moviemaking. The cast appears to be rolling with whatever halfhearted notion strikes them in each scene. The guys goof off. The guys hang out. The guys pratfall. The guys pee in public. The guys tease one another about getting old/fat/drunk/pretentious. The film unspools without form or characterization or drive like a home movie of Sandler and his drinking buddies ad libbing. The affection the stars feel for each other is clear but its impossible to share it. Their comic styles dont mesh. Spades sarcasm and Rocks dry wit exist in different comic dimensions from James oafish physicality and Schneiders bug-eyed eccentricity. As for Sandler he has simply stopped trying. GROWN UPS 1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for crude material including sexual references language and some male rear nudity. Thankfully the film proceeds without the combative anger-management issues that propel so many of Sandlers movies. His most aggressive act is to smack Schneiders New Age food faddist in the kisser with a dehydrated banana. There is a climactic basketball game with the friends old middle-school rivals (including 1990s ""Saturday Night Live"" second-stringers Colin Quinn and Tim Meadows) but the showdown is a low-stakes affair. Without a real antagonist theres no struggle no goal for the characters. Theyre just killing time onscreen. Slowly and painfully.

ABOUT THE MOVIEGrown Ups  1/2 (out of four) Stars Adam Sandler Chris Rock Rob Schneider David Spade Kevin JamesDirector Dennis DuganDistributor Sony PicturesRating PG-13 for crude material including suggestive references language and some male nudityRunning time 1 hour 38 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Scott Bowles USA TODAY Despite its title Grown Ups doesnt demonstrate much in the way of maturity. That shouldnt be surprising given the man behind the movie Adam Sandler. He may be 43 and a father but Sandler remains entrenched in the ribald humor that made him a star in the late 90s with such films as Happy Gilmore Billy Madison and The Waterboy. TRAILER Check out a preview of Grown Ups Now though the humor seems to be aging along with the star. Sandler (who wrote the script) may still find flatulence and fat jokes funny but unless you like to see men struggling with their bodily functions the gross-out humor falls flat here. Co-starring Sandlers buddies Chris Rock David Spade and Rob Schneider Grown Ups plays more like an inside joke between friends. Think Oceans Eleven with paunch. Sandler plays Lenny a Hollywood agent embarrassed by his success. His wife (Salma Hayek) is a mercurial clothing designer while his spoiled kids keep texting the nanny for more latte. After Lennys childhood basketball coach ""Buzzer"" (Blake Clark) dies he and his former teammates reunite at the funeral after 30 years. The ceremony turns into a weekend reunion that is primarily a put-down contest among buds. Each pounces on the others weaknesses Rock is an emasculated husband Schneider a new-age vegan with a taste for older women Spade a drunk and James well hes Paul Blart in the woods. All of which would be fine if there were nuance to the comedy. But instead of getting a Big Chill for the YouTube generation we get five men who never grew up (and have no intention of doing so) shoot arrows into crowds ogle leggy ladies and mock a 4-year-old boy who is still breast-feeding. The film directed by frequent Sandler collaborator Dennis Dugan is packed with talent perhaps too much. No character truly develops. Maria Bello and Maya Rudolph play hapless wives but they get to do little more than cast scowls at their men. Steve Buscemi Norm Macdonald and Colin Quinn make appearances but all serve as props for the primary stars. Say this for Grown Ups Its heart is in the right place. The actors seem genuinely fond of one another and the message -- dont pass up lifes simple pleasures -- suits its PG-13 rating. And the 80s soundtrack is spot-on. But it isnt enough to salvage this film. By the time we reach the finale (though it has a nice twist) it feels as if its time to pack your bags and head home. Sandler may still have a hit on his hands. The actors fans are as rabid as any and he continues to churn out blockbusters Funny People notwithstanding. But if Sandler hopes to win over new fans he may want to cork the scatological humor and let it age a bit.

A reunion comedy in both concept (school buddies come together 30 years later) and cast (Saturday Night Live confreres Adam Sandler Chris Rock Rob Schneider and David Spade) the film drifts along on a stream of humiliation jokes - physical emotional sexual hairpiece-ial.This should come as no surprise given the involvement of the SNL alums - joined as the fifth of the friends by The King of Queens Kevin James. When the now-middle-age guys hear that their beloved junior high school basketball coach who inspired them to victory and ""to play life like you played that game"" has passed on Lenny (Sandler) Eric (James) Kirk (Rock) Marcus (Spade) and Rob (Schneider) convene by an idyllic lake to spread the coachs ashes and share the memories of their storied youth.Regret and raunchiness nostalgia and naughtiness ensue.Even Maria Bello and Salma Hayek playing respectively spouses to Eric and to Lenny willingly submit to the buffoonery Bello with a breast pump and a running gag about nursing her 4-year-old and Hayek with a shot of her exiting a bathroom several sheets of toilet paper affixed to her rear.Directed by Dennis Dugan (I Now Pronounce You Chuck amp; Larry) with a script credited to Sandler and longtime SNL head writer Fred Wolf Grown Ups lazily makes its way from Point A to Point B establishing the individual characters on their home turf then amassing them for a memorial service and the weekend wake in an inspirational rustic setting. Point C is reserved for reflection reconciliation and rear-end ogling. (The guys kick back in Adirondack chairs eyeing the improbable and leggy offspring of the schlubby toupe-topped Rob.)Lenny is now an A-list Hollywood agent his wife is a fashion designer with a show in Milan and their kids are spoiled brats (they upbraid the nanny for serving subpar hot chocolate). Kirk is a culinary-challenged stay-at-home dad with a high-powered businesswoman wife (Maya Rudolph) and a carping mother-in-law (Ebony Jo-Ann). Eric is hardly as successful as he lets on and Rob is married to an oldster (Joyce Van Patten) - the butt of geriatric and New Age jokes. Spades Marcus is just a creep.Grown Ups gets laughs (or tries to) from urination and flatulence from butts and bunions and gets mushy and meaningful as it examines the hard slogs of marriage and parenting. Theres a lot of comic riffery going on and the easy camaraderie among Sandler Rock et. al. goes a long way toward concealing the flimsiness and familiarity of the material. Of course theres a hearty round of hugs and high-fives at the end as everybody realizes that having good friends and family means a whole lot more than just having stuff.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Viewers who enjoy any single gag in the new Adam Sandler vehicle Grown Ups are in for a treat as theyll be able to experience it again five or 10 more times. Beyond all the repetition Grown Ups delivers an unmistakably Sandlerian souffle of slapstick and sentiment alternating cheap jokes and heart-tugging scenes like an early groaner where Sandlers adorable prepubescent daughter tells dad that she wants to use his cars navigational system to find heaven. After venturing outside his comfort zone in Funny People Sandler retreats into the realm of the soothingly familiar playing a hotshot Hollywood agent who reunites with boyhood pals Chris Rock Kevin James David Spade and Rob Schneider for the funeral of their beloved elementary-school basketball coach. The good times start early for the overgrown adolescents as they chuckle and joke their way through the funeral then keep going when the party moves to a lake house where they spend a weekend reliving cherished memories and working through their very minor issues. The prospect of five seasoned comedy professionals and old friends riffing through a relaxed ramshackle comedy with only the faintest hint of a plot radiates promise but the reality proves painful. The one-note performances and endlessly recycled gags--which run the gamut from jokes about Schneiders sex-crazed geriatric wife to pop-culture-themed wisecracks about Rocks mother-in-laws grotesque toes--betray the toxic arrogance of coasting comic superstars who realize they can exert the least possible effort and still come away with a hit. Sandlers self-indulgence knows no bounds The film even concludes with him goofing his way through a song about his father. If Grown Ups were any lazier or more slapdash itd be a home movie.

Comments click to enlarge Grown Ups Video Rated PG-13  102 minutes  2010 Watching a comedian grow old is always sad but in the case of Adam Sandler its abject. In this starring vehicle from his lazy crony-ridden Happy Madison Productions five old pals (Sandler Chris Rock Kevin James David Spade and the inevitable Rob Schneider) reunite with their families at a lakeside retreat to rehearse the old doody and peepee gags work through their perfunctory character conflicts and grow solemn at the sappy music cues. Age-inappropriate behavior is constantly ridiculed (Schneiders character is married to an old woman and one of the children is still breast-feeding at four) yet Sandler who cowrote the screenplay gives a pass to his clique of middle-aged men viciously razzing each other like junior high students. Beneath all the forced hilarity lies an awful fear of aging--and Sandler is only 43 This is gonna be rough. Dennis Dugan directed; with Salma Hayek Maria Bello and Maya Rudolph. By J.R.

Grown Ups Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2010) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/grown-ups-2010,200,grownups23,grownups,rogerebert
"Grown Ups | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; grown-ups ) Grown Ups (United States 2010) June 23 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli Sometimes even a high profile movie can surprise you. Take Grown Ups for example. Based on the advance promotional material this didnt look like the kind of production likely to end Adam Sandlers streak of unremarkable star vehicles (Funny People Bedtime Stories You Dont Mess with the Zohan I Now Pronounce You Chuck amp; Larry). But lo and behold Grown Ups turns out to be the funniest thing in which Sandler has appeared in years. Its also the most humorous motion picture directed by his frequent collaborator Dennis Dugan in at least a decade (and perhaps ever). The strength of Grown Ups is evident early it doesnt have much of a plot. One of the chief problems with many of Sandlers recent endeavors is that the story has been given too much weight. Here its as threadbare as possible - a clothes hanger upon which jokes and sketches can be strung out in the breeze to blow around. It doesnt always work - there are the usual misses and any time the production goes for something dramatic or sentimental the result is a clunker. But no one in their right mind goes to an Adam Sandler movie for any reason other than to laugh and Grown Ups delivers. The death of their junior high basketball coach provides the impetus for a reunion of the five principals of the team - Lenny (Adam Sandler) Eric (Kevin James) Kurt (Chris Rock) Marcus (David Spade) and Rob (Rob Schneider) - some 30 years after they won a championship game. Now each is encumbered with baggage. Lenny a big-time Hollywood agent is married to fashionista Roxanne (Salma Hayek) and has three spoiled kids. Eric is unemployed and his wife Sally (Maria Bello) believes in breast-feeding past birthday 4. Kurt has become a house-husband and is dominated by his Type A wife Deanne (Maya Rudolph). Rob has allowed his fetish for older women to take reign; his wife Gloria (Joyce Van Patten) is in her mid-70s. And Marcus has never really grown up - hes single and loves to party and that makes him the envy of his friends. The ""action"" takes place at a posh lake house where these nine adults and their offspring gather for a Fourth of July weekend that includes lessons about what to do when theres no flat-screen TV and a trip to a water park. Grown Ups has a loose unforced structure that gives the illusion of a bunch of comrades hanging out. Even the climax to the extent that there is one is low-key. Theres an improvisational feeling to a lot of the comedy indicating that even though Adam Sandler and Fred Wolf are the credited screenwriters there were likely significant contributions by at least the male cast members all of whom are known as (if not always respected as) comedians. Freed from the constraints of having to follow the beats of a lame plot they are allowed to hang out and joke around - and thats where most of the successful comedy is born. There are some great one liners some really silly physical humor and the obligatory body function jokes but the ratio of hits-to-misses is surprisingly high. As is appropriate for a film entitled Grown Ups Adam Sandler has assumed a more moderate mature role. Only hints of the oversized petulant man-child are evident in Lenny; this is the kind of individual one might imagine Happy Gilmore or Billy Madison becoming in middle age. Sandler also shows generosity here giving most of the best comedic bits to Kevin James (physical pratfalls) and Chris Rock (verbal material and facial expressions). David Spade often as irritating as pepper spray is almost palatable and Rob Schneider one of the most unfunny individuals to be branded as a ""comedian"" garners laughs (most of which are mean-spirited). The women are underused but thats to be expected. Grown Ups is for the guys. This is their The Big Chill. One aspect that fails are the attempts at message moments and dramatic interludes (the importance of family the difficulties of growing older etc.). Perhaps Sandler and Dugan are attempting to mimic Judd Apatows approach to comedies raunchy humor wrapped around a soft center. If thats the case the filmmakers have made this center too gooey. Fortunately Grown Ups never dwells much on the serious material instead moving quickly to the next comedy skit. The result falls short of a complete meal but provides an easily digestible 100-minute massage of the funny bone.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Grown Ups doesnt try very hard for its laughs. Adam Sandler asked some of his funny friends -- Chris Rock Kevin James David Spade and Rob Schneider -- to hang out with him for the time necessary to shoot this movie about childhood friends (and former preteen basketball champions) reunited for a weekend of family-friendly nonsense at a lake house. If youve ever wondered what ""The Big Chill would be like with old ""Saturday Night Live castmates -- well why would you ever have done that?The occasion for the reunion is the recent death of their old coach. Once thats shrugged off the movie can begin practicing Teflon comedy where nothing bad sticks to the characters. At the funeral the boys see each other for the first time in years and proceed to put each other down. The giant dog in the back seat of Jamess convertible is compared to his mother. James makes fun of Rocks palsied grip by noting that its ""like shaking hands with an eagle. Ouch. Not really though. The insults are meant more to amuse us than anger the characters -- and some of them are pretty funny.But that joshing approach to humor extends to marriage and family relationships. We are shown much thats disturbing a breast-feeding toddler a man tumbling down a hill Salma Hayek married to Sandler. But none of it is taken as seriously as the nice sincere moments. The thing about Teflon is that its not selective. So its slightly illogical that the good will sticks and the mean stuff doesnt.Above all this is a movie of vast and vexing illogic. And its not just the incongruity of the marriages -- James is with Maria Bello Rock with Maya Rudolph. Theyre such different comedians that some acting is required for the relationships to make sense and Rock hasnt actually acted since ""New Jack City. Meanwhile Sandlers character is a very successful Hollywood agent. Why does he pretend that his brats nanny (Di Quon) is a friend studying for med school? Why does it take so long for someone to call him on it? And why would Rudolph bring her loudmouth mother (Ebony Jo-Ann)? Why for the fart jokes of course -- and the opportunity to tell you that her characters name is Mama Ronzoni. (It should be noted that the women are more naturally funny in this movie than the men including the shockingly at ease Joyce Van Patten who plays Schneiders 70-something lady love.)Perhaps the relationships and themes under consideration are so familiar (the seesaw of marriage the hassles of parenthood nostalgia for lost time) that we can make do with the shorthand. But the way the movie handles the peculiarities in say James and Bellos onscreen marriage only draws more attention to their dysfunction.Its especially hard for James to get away with letting things roll off of him. His character is miserable for one thing. For another James might be a better actor than he realizes. Despite his girth he moves like a dancer. All his self-confidence is physical. He laughs off every embarrassment that he confesses (like a food addiction) or endures (teasing about Bellos failure to wean her breast-feeding child). But theres a discomfort in his face that often suggests a range of pain and shame. He deserves better movies even if he doesnt believe it.Yet despite how cruddy-looking and deplorably made this movie is -- Dennis Dugan you strike again -- it does have a heart. Theres a happy sequence set at a water park (Warehams Water Wizz to be exact) that obviates the plotlessness and pointlessness afoot. Sandler wrote ""Grown Ups with Fred Wolf and he likes many of the characters in his movies even the adult bully that the underemployed comedian Colin Quinn plays here. I just wish Sandler took movie comedy more seriously than he does. The man partly responsible for two shameless social farces ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck amp; Larry and ""You Dont Mess With the Zohan is being lazy even by the standards of ""Big Daddy.A moment of cheesiness often follows a flight of debauchery. It makes sense. In Sandlers movies men dont cry; they urinate. So the scene in which the stars empty their bladders and change the color of a swimming pools water might be the weepiest of the year.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Grown Ups Bomb to bad Director Dennis Dugan. Cast Adam Sandler Kevin James Chris Rock. Rating Rated PG-13 for crude material including suggestive references language and some male rear nudity. RELATED Spotlight Adam Sandler Spotlight Chris Rock Spotlight Salma Hayek Too bad they dont let anyone else in on the fun. Dumb lazy obvious and largely pointless the film directed by Dennis Dugan (""You Dont Mess with the Zohan"" ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck amp; Larry"") has the occasional laugh. Blind pig acorn all that. A movie doesnt have to be brilliant to be enjoyable - see this weeks ""Knight and Day"" for proof of that - but they ought to at least try. An opening scene set at a basketball game introduces us to the child versions of the grown-up characters. Theres basketball star Lenny Feder (Adam Sandler) tough guy Eric (Kevin James) Kurt (Chris Rock) Marcus (David Spade) and Rob (Rob Schneider) who win a championship for their beloved coach. His death 30 years later leads to a post-funeral reunion at a lake house the perfect setting for characters to resolve the problems in their lives. Or for a serial killer which might have been more interesting. Lenny is a successful Hollywood agent married to successful ambitious fashion designer Roxanne (Salma Hayek) and embarrassed by how spoiled and privileged his kids have become (he insists that the nanny be referred to as an exchange student). Erics wife Sally (Maria Bello) is still breast-feeding their son - whos 4 years old. Kurt is a whipped househusband while his wife Deanne (Maya Rudolph) handles the my-job-is-my-life bit. Marcus is still single and on the hunt for any woman available while Rob is a New-Age vegan married to the much-older Gloria (Joyce Van Patten) which yeah ha-ha whatever. If your movie gives Schneider a more interesting character than Rock youve got problems. Its like ""The Big Chill"" made by morons. Ebony Jo-Ann is on hand as the stereotypical meddling mother-in-law of Kurt; her bunion and flatulence supply two of the many running jokes. Steve Buscemi has a small part that requires him to spend a lot of time in a body cast hands thrust upward as if signaling a touchdown. It tells you something that this is one of the funnier bits in the film. The actors seem to be having a grand old time. There is a lot of laughter among them which perhaps means theyre breaking character and cracking up but that implies that there are characters to break. Instead its mostly five guys sitting around cracking wise. Whenever you and your pals do that naturally some of it is funny some of it isnt. The difference is you dont charge admission. Was there a script? Evidently; Sandler and Fred Wolf are credited with writing it. But it plays as if the actors just riffed on whatever came to mind operating from the barest of outlines. If youre Christopher Guest making ""Best in Show"" with his brilliant band of improv specialists that can be great. If youre Dennis Dugan working with David Spade and Rob Schneider maybe not. More like goofing off among friends than an actual movie ""Grown Ups"" suggests the old saying more than any film I can think of I guess you had to be there.

Directed by Dennis Dugan (You Dont Mess With the Zohan) the movie is about five schmoes in their early 40s who reunite at a lakeside cabin for the funeral of their old beloved basketball coach (who led them to victory when they were 12). Each of the characters has two traits and a warm heart; according to todays screenwriting math thats three dimensions. Sandler is the Hollywood agent with a high-maintenance wife (Salma Hayek) and a trio of kids who are bratty pampered technology nuts. Rob Schneider is a pompadoured vegan married to a hippie old enough to be his mother. Chris Rock is a househusband whose wife (Maya Rudolph) and mother-in-law keep his balls in a sling. David Spade is the drunken lewd single guy and Kevin James is a jolly loser whose wife (Maria Bello) still breast-feeds their 4-year-old son. For a while the movie looks like Couples Retreat or a Tyler Perry house party only instead of cookie-cutter conflicts everyone just grows happier and more relaxed. Theres a token sprinkle of gross-out gags (a giant bunion a game of ""arrow roulette"") and Schneiders daughters are ridiculous leggy babes out of an old Warrant video but mostly this is a comedy about five ordinary wisenheimers just hanging out trying to top each other with insults and catch a break from the families they (mostly) love. The big climax? Everyone goes to a water park Diverting enough to get by Grown Ups is Adam Sandler growing up -- but not too much.

Or is the verb Im looking for ""coasting""?Grown Ups begins with a flashback to a 1978 boys basketball championship where the starting five look like 12-year-old versions of the aforementioned lineup. Introducing the cast as recognizable adolescent versions of the adult characters theyll grow into is a move familiar from the mid-90s Saturday Night Live movie template a la Chris Farley and Spade at the beginning of Tommy Boy--and Grown Ups is a Class of 1990 reunion for SNLs 16th season where now-fortysomething stars Sandler Rock Spade and Schneider all debuted (Kevin James fields fat jokes for the late Farley). True to its lineage Grown Ups even ends with a climactic contest--Im surprised they dont save somebodys family business along the way.Grown Ups catches up with the teammates 30 years later reunited for Coachs funeral in their New England hometown (helpfully identified onscreen as ""New England""). Star shooter Sandler is a Hollywood agent married to successful fashion designer Salma Hayek and exasperated by two spoiled sons who live inside nihilistic video games (echoing Clicks Luddite message and humorously visualized). Rock is a stay-at-home dad with a third kid on the way from Maya Rudolph; Jamess ""48-month-old"" is still breastfeeding from mom Maria Bello to the delight of David Spade importing his still-single horndog shtick while Schneider is the New-Age-sensitive-guy who the gang single out for razzing because of his granola-granny wife his veganism and his use of poultices.Entrusted with Coachs ashes the boys and their families head for their old summer-getaway lodge where they sit in Adirondack chairs by a perpetually gold-shimmering lake. The guest list includes the urn Rocks stock-comic mother-in-law a dog with snipped vocal cords (its gurgling bark one of many if-at-first-you-dont-succeed running jokes) five men four wives and 10 kids. This small army becomes a gridlock of gags and plotlines with conflicts and assigned traits dropped and hastily retrieved as needed. Rudolph is the only capable comedienne among the wives; the men are either unfunny or if given fewer lines useless. Though the uncynical goodwill that accompanies Sandlers work makes footing this vacation bill less enraging than the toxic Couples Retreat its one of those Sandler movies where the inevitable Steve Buscemi cameo passes for the highlight.Happy Madison Productions house director Dennis Dugans comic timing here is a snap-snap-lets-go rush to the next ""outrageous"" moment potentially fatal pratfalls repeated public urination crotch hits gushers of breast milk Grandmamas infected big toe Coachs ashes blown over a prominently displayed bucket of KFC Grilled Chicken. (In a piece of admirable restraint only Spade displays his bare ass.) While Sandler has never trafficked in epigrammatic wit theres a difference between say Billy Madisons ""Of course I peed my pants--everyone my age pees their pants"" or I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larrys shakedown of hetero squeamishness and this lazy stuff--the difference between smart-dumb and plain-dumb.
