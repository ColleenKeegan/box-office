Of all the feelings they express in the course of this flawed but beautiful film one is as basic as the language of love can be. ""You have my heart"" Zooey Deschanels Noel tells her boyfriend Paul who is played by Paul Schneider. Four little words spoken softly but with a candor that gives them piercing urgency. Who says such unhip things in movies these days? More to the point how has Mr. Green at the age of 28 already managed to make two movies that distinguish themselves from others of any day? Like his debut feature of three years ago the exquisite ""George Washington"" this new one has my heart and I think it will have yours. The hero of ""George Washington"" was a winsome boy whose skull had failed to fuse; he wore a football helmet to protect his soft fontanel. The lovers in ""All the Real Girls"" are older -- Noel is 18 and Paul is 22 -- with skulls firmly in place; its their souls that are still wide open. Noel recently returned from boarding school to her scruffy home town in North Carolina is vivid and fitfully articulate but a virgin socially as well as sexually. Paul a likable dreamer who works on cars when he isnt hanging out with his vague buddies has been a notorious womanizer around town. Now hes fallen in love with Noel so for the first time he wants to delay having sex partly to disavow his history of promiscuity and partly to avoid problems with her volatile brother who happens to be his best friend. His reluctance and her ardor provide the substance of the movies opening scene which is long and unfashionably -- almost defiantly -- slow. Long scenes of mounting intensity are one of Mr. Greens specialties. A matched pair of them each almost six minutes long take place in bed but with words not sex as the binding force. When sex finally does come to the fore it threatens to drive the lovers apart. The film is beset now and then by outbreaks of preciousness; I particularly wish they hadnt sent in the clowns. Still the story feels fresh professional actors mix comfortably with non-professionals and both of the starring performances are memorable. Ms. Deschanel has the most experience and skill; shes like a Tuva throat singer in her ability to express a given emotion and simultaneously its complex harmonics. Paul Schneiders role is less dynamic but this attractive intelligent and unmannered actor is very much in the American grain and entirely at home in a movie whose setting is some timeless corner of America -- the period could as easily be the 1970s as the present -- that resonates with our national memory. (Like ""George Washington"" ""All the Real Girls"" was shot in small-town North Carolina.) Rusty remnants of deceased industries kudzu vines a crippled dog distant mountains its all taken in by Tim Orrs camera with special attention to odd juxtapositions but also to serenity and community. (Sometimes the ruminative score sounds like church bells.) The people who live here dont seem to doubt that they belong here and dont seem to worry about race; they take one another as they come. A sense of community is central to Mr. Greens vision and I use the V word advisedly. As young as this filmmaker is he has developed a distinctive style thats both celebratory and elegiac and one that has been refined in both films by Mr. Orrs gorgeous cinematography. Mr. Greens work has already been compared to that of Terrence Malick in ""Days of Heaven"" or ""Badlands."" The visual parallels are irresistible. But Mr. Malicks films are emotionally remote or at best allusive while Mr. Green goes for feelings however mercurial in every scene. Three years ago when ""George Washington"" was released the director told Charlie Rose that one of the most beautiful movies hed ever seen was ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller."" Thats a better point of reference and a more encouraging one. At a time when so many young filmmakers are chroniclers of the dysfunctional and masters of the predictable along comes a poet of the ineffable. Daredevil One of the more unwieldy euphemisms of our time is differently abled as opposed to plain old disabled but its the right term for Ben Afflecks character in ""Daredevil."" By day he is Matt Murdock a blind lawyer with a tap-tap-tapping white cane who lost his sight in a childhood accident. By night he is Daredevil an anti-crime vigilante whose remaining four senses function as he puts it in a splay-footed voiceover ""with superhuman sharpness."" This guy can hear incoming bullets then dodge them Matrixly. He can smell a beautiful woman on the other side of a plate glass window. (Take that Al Pacino.) He is also inexplicably anti-gravity bounding around the rooftops of Gotham City -- I mean New York -- like one of Spider-Mans ilk sans silk. But do his heightened senses dull our own? Not at all. The Man Without Fear has made it from Marvel Comics to the screen with no major mishaps and lo another movie franchise is born. Before ""Daredevil"" screened Wednesday night I was a Man With Much Fear. For one thing movies that screen so late in the week are presumed by people like me to be utter stinkers until proven otherwise; why else would a studio wait until the last possible moment for review? For another the prospect of seeing Ben Affleck in a red rubber suit prompted certain doubts about him pulling the role off. But massively marketed productions like this one are increasingly critic-proof and critic-indifferent if not averse; when they find their young audience its mainly through TV trailers word of mouth or the Web. And Mr. Affleck does pull it off despite a few clumsy lapses to which his fans will turn millions of blind eyes. Hes witty by day and mostly plausible by night as a superhero with human failings plus a burning passion for Elektra a rich martial artist played impressively by Jennifer Garner. Elektra is the woman who first catches Matts nose then becomes Daredevils nemesis as well as his inamorata. One of the best scenes pits them against each other in high-spirited kung fu combat that recalls the fight over a womans comb in ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon."" (This and several other fight sequences were staged by the Hong Kong action choreographer Cheung Yan Yuen.) Matt and Elektra also share a delicate moment on a rooftop where falling rain creates a sort of sonogram that allows him to detect with his inner radar the lovely contours of her face. (You might wonder why he doesnt just reach out and touch her in the first place but that wouldnt be the superheroic thing to do.) ""Daredevil"" was written and directed by Mark Steven Johnson and photographed by Ericson Core. It isnt a great film or even a greatly original one. Still it has many grace notes and interesting oddities. Noise is its heros kryptonite. Matt struggles not only with a moral dilemma -- how to reconcile his desire to do justice with his vigilantes rage -- but with bodily pain which he assuages by popping the occasional Darvon or Percoset. Jon Favreau is funny as Matts partner in a storefront law firm. Joe Pantoliano is a reporter for no not the Daily Planet but the New York Post. That human subwoofer Michael Clarke Duncan is Kingpin the baddest of the citys bad guys. Colin Farrell plays Bullseye a psychotic killer with perfect aim who seems to be fresh off the boat from ""A Clockwork Orange."" Bullseye takes a terrible toll in collateral damage and steals every scene hes in.    DVD TIP Criterion has done right by David Gordon Greens ""George Washington"" (2000) and then some. First and foremost on the disk is the movie itself -- a lyrical magical meditation on friendship and what happens when the dream state of childhood must give way to stern reality. Supplementary material includes several short films that the director made in his student days at the North Carolina School of the Arts and one of his early influences a startling 1969 short by Clu Gulager called ""A Day With the Boys."" With digital resources like this film scholarship becomes barely distinguishable from fun.

By David Denby ""The Life of David Gale"" is one of those hyper-articulate messes which inspire awe and a kind of nauseated pity. This is no ordinary cock-up this is a remarkably talented cock-up made with wit and feeling and featuring a classic performance by a great actress Laura Linney. But all the lovely acting and the high intelligence (a former philosophy professor named Charles Randolph wrote the script) have been poured into a stupid story that relies on the rusted mechanics of a routine thriller. The movie is plotted against the clock David Gale (Kevin Spacey) a philosophy professor at the University of Austin and an anti-death-penalty advocate has been convicted of murder. After sitting on death row for six years Gale is about to be executed--in four days--and only the ace investigative reporter Bitsey Bloom (Kate Winslet) can save him. Alan Parker who has made both good movies (""Shoot the Moon"" ""Birdy"") and terrible ones (""The Road to Wellville"" ""Evita"") apparently knows no shame because he gives us such jaw droppers as a rented car that overheats and stalls like a cranky burro just as Bitsey is rushing to prevent the execution. Holding the exculpatory evidence in her hands Winslet then runs through the entire state of Texas--down roads through towns even across a graveyard planted with more white crosses than Flanders Field. She runs for Kevin Spaceys life. We all know why such feeble stuff is there. Its what allows a major American studio (Universal) to persuade itself to finance a movie with a literate script. But once you rely on such devices you halfway kill the script and generally discredit the movie in the eyes of the audience it seems aimed at--an audience that could follow the academic references the legal arguments the moral sentiments so casually tossed off by the characters. The picture is practically an ad for the dysfunctions of the current system of making movies. Bitsey Bloom is meant to be a kind of virtuous opportunist--a tough news-magazine journalist with a good heart. The character has integrity (shes gone to jail for her beliefs) but Winslet in a classic mistake plays the role as if the slightest display of charm would compromise Bitseys strength. Winslet is strenuous and beautiful with a noble Victorian brow and a sharply cut mouth. Her eyes blazing she has a startling vividness. But Winslets anger is joined to a fatal lack of humor and if she doesnt lighten up she could degenerate into the educated persons Demi Moore. The indomitable Bitsey heads out from her magazines Park Avenue headquarters and pays Gale a half-million-dollar fee for a three-day interview leading up to the execution. Morose and wrathful he was convicted of raping and murdering his close friend and colleague Constance Harraway (Laura Linney) a fellow-professor and anti-death-penalty activist. Did he really commit the crime? Or was he set up by right-wingers who wanted to destroy him? As Gale tells his story to Bitsey we get to see his earlier life and some of the college-scene banter is fun. Gale wearing denim delivers a racy lecture on Jacques Lacans theories of fantasy and one of Gales colleagues talks of using a ""hermeneutical bias"" to interpret Gales collapsing marriage. The phrase may panic the malls (""Herman who?"") but the movie makes it abundantly clear whats happening to Gale. He hits the bottle and recites naughty limericks at an uproarious student-teacher party. Hes meant to be a good man without discipline--a serious thinker and crusader who cant or wont pull himself together. Glassy-eyed unshaven his posture slack Spacey goes all the way into his recent obsession with weak stumbling characters. Here and there he flounders so badly that one has to restrain a Maggie Thatcher impulse to shake him by the shoulders--""Buck up a bit fellow""--but its a relief to see an American hero who is far from perfect. Spacey delivers bitterly intelligent alcoholic lines as if he knew what they meant. And Laura Linney lifts him out of the depths. Linney was amazing two years ago in ""You Can Count on Me"" as an ordinary small-town woman trying to get on with her life. Here she reverses direction playing a woman devoted to others a protest-movement workhorse obsessed with the prisoners on Texass death row. With her blond hair now dark her complexion pale she captures the exacerbated hopes and chagrins of those who care too much those who can never separate their emotions from their beliefs. In ""David Gale"" the flame of Texas liberalism which has been known to flicker burns brightly and steadily; in the middle of the thriller story the movie offers sincere homage to the ragtag army of Texas dissidents who are revolted by the local fondness for lethal injections.The miracle of Linneys performance is that her anguish now and then gives way to a desperate gaiety. Shes dying of leukemia and she tells Gale that she doesnt have the patience or the interest to go through Elisabeth Kubler-Rosss celebrated stages of grief. She will not appreciate the blades of grass. The scene in which the dying woman and the drowning man reach out to each other is as touching as anything in ""The Hours."" Alan Parker has a gift for intimacy but he betrays it here. The movie is packed with information and attitudes that are almost impossible to sort out. Parker relies on a pretentious editing scheme in which sequences are bridged with whirling montages of classroom notes--""lust"" and ""innocence"" and ""guilt"" the notes proclaim. ""David Gale"" turns into a murder mystery a variant of the kind of puzzle in which a corpse is discovered in a locked room. On a videotape that suddenly shows up we see the death itself--Constance naked a plastic bag over her head dying of suffocation. The first time through the tape is terrifying. By the third time one begins to sicken slightly even rebel against the exploitation of ones curiosity. Didnt Parker realize that having built up all that feeling for Constance he couldnt abuse her--or us--in such a way? This intelligent movie is no more than half-conscious. In the lengthy press notes for the picture Alan Parker asserts that he is against the death penalty. The only trouble is no one could determine his point of view from the movie itself. ""David Gale"" could easily be taken as an attack on anti-death-penalty activists--an exposure of the lengths they will go to make a point. When ""David Gale"" flops Universal will be tempted to say something like ""The audience wasnt ready for it."" And my guess is that this line will be used as an argument against the next original project that comes along. Actually the audience was quite ready. Its Universal that wasnt. The company should have straightened out this self-damaging project before shooting began. If Im not mistaken thats one of the things executives and producers are paid seven-figure salaries to do. ""Daredevil"" the new comic-book spectacular has exactly one good scene. Ben Affleck as a blind lawyer who becomes a superhero by night meets Jennifer Garner playing an heiress and martial-arts expert and follows her; the two then get to know each other by fighting in a city park--spinning kickingand jumping with a flapping seesaw as a prop. Much of the rest of ""Daredevil"" is so dark that you cant see it. I dont think youre missing a great deal. The movie is derivative flat halfhearted its squareness unrelieved by irony or fantasy. Affleck in his maroon jumpsuit flips from nowhere to nowhere in a black-on-black digital New York that seems based on sketches rejected by the creators of the first ""Batman."" In last years ""Changing Lanes"" Affleck woke up as an actor but in ""Daredevil"" he tries for a light-voiced unemphatic presence and he registers no more powerfully than he did in ""Pearl Harbor."" In these big movies he seems a put-on movie star a lazybones puffed by enormous helium bursts of publicity. Is Affleck trying to save his reputation for cool among his friends by absenting himself from the huge structures built around him? There may be a future in such a tactic but I doubt it.

(c)20th Century Fox By Ben Nuckols Associated Press Writer ""Daredevil"" is a dispassionate affair buffed to a sheen throughout -- from the digitally touched-up images to Ben Afflecks exquisitely tousled mop-top to the painstaking setup of a sequel in the final reel. Yet occasionally a naughtier pulp sensibility creeps out of this by-the-numbers comic book-to-film. Its a little darker a little bloodier and a little more adult than its Marvel Comics-spawned counterparts ""Spider-Man"" and ""X-Men."" On the surface our hero sounds unassailably noble. Matt Murdock (Affleck) was blinded in an accident at age 12 and shortly thereafter his washed-up boxer dad was murdered -- perhaps by the mysterious Kingpin who controls all the crime in New York City. Though blind Matts other senses become hyper-acute so he transforms himself into Daredevil a high-flying superhero with Batmans gadgets and Spider-Mans physique who brings thugs to justice in the Hells Kitchen neighborhood. By day hes an attorney who champions the oppressed. But hes not without his complications. Matt has casual sex and pops prescription painkillers like candy and when a case doesnt go his way his revenge can be extreme. When a rapist escapes conviction Daredevil tracks him down and imposes a creative sentence -- death by subway-train bisection. Affleck can do dark and tormented when hes working on a small emotionally intimate scale as in ""Boiler Room"" and last years superb ""Changing Lanes."" But when he goes into star mode its all smirky frat-boy diffidence -- Daredevils demons dont get the introspective treatment they deserve. Daredevil doesnt drive the wispy plot anyhow as much as by love interest Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner) whose name says Matts law partner (Jon Favreau) ""sounds like a Mexican appetizer."" Elektras billionaire father (Erick Avari) wants to get out of business with Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan) so the crime boss calls in henchman Bullseye (Colin Farrell) for some none-too-subtle persuasion. ""Daredevil"" is meant to be the big-screen coming-out party for Garner star of ABCs action weepy ""Alias"" but playing a self-made wonder woman with every last ounce of body fat burned into oblivion shes an icy inaccessible presence. She may be the only actress for whom squeezing out a tear is an aerobic exercise. Mark Steven Johnson who also wrote the script directs crisply but timidly in a style that could be summed up as ""Batman"" meets ""The Matrix meets ""Spider-Man."" Occasionally though some personal expression seeps through. Johnson has a knack for little explosions of violence -- an unexpected talent from the writer of ``Grumpy Old Men and the director of ""Simon Birch."" A spurt of blood makes all the difference in his airless action sequences; suddenly we feel that something is at stake. The violence is not graphic but stylized and pictorially potent _ like a good comic-book frame. Johnsons exuberant co-conspirator is Colin Farrell who slips away with the movie as the multi-pierced bald Bullseye. Credit Johnson for upping Farrells comfort level by allowing him to keep his native Irish accent. We meet Bullseye inside one of Farrells well-documented favorite places -- a pub where hes draining pints and playing darts. The Irish rappers House of Pain can be heard in the background as he uses paperclips to kill a man who insults his heritage. With just a smattering of dialogue Farrell creates a gleeful assassin all slinking body language and rowdy comic menace. Aside from a few scenes in ""Minority Report"" its his most exciting work since ""Tigerland"" the movie that made him a star. When Farrells on screen ""Daredevil"" becomes more than just a finely tuned entertainment machine. In a movie that will rake people in no matter what its fun to see something unexpected. ""Daredevil"" is rated PG-13 for action violence and some sexuality. Running time 103 minutes. Return to top Copyright(c) 2000 - 2016 Canarsie Courier Publications Inc.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Daredevil was historically a Marvel Comics second-stringer but in hindsight it makes sense that writer and artist Frank Miller made him the starting point for the superhero renaissance of the 1980s which looked deep into the psyches of the people beneath the tights found heroes with scars and demons and set the tone for comics and their film adaptations ever since. Who after all had a rougher time of it than Matt Murdock a poor kid blinded orphaned and thrown to the tender mercies of New Yorks Hells Kitchen? His powers come from a sense of loss (his four remaining senses are heightened by his blindness) and even his choice of profession spoke to the great divide within him. A lawyer by day he acts as a one-man star chamber at night. Drawn from a grab-bag of characters and incidents taken mostly from Millers run on the comics series writer-director Mark Steven Johnsons version of Daredevil seems aware of the murky waters it sets out to explore. That makes its tendency to hug the shore all the more frustrating even though Johnson starts off by making his hero even darker than expected. Ben Affleck steps into the cowl and fetish suit and for his first adventure Johnson has him cold-bloodedly murder a rapist who cheated justice. Its almost as if the writer-director had accidentally made a film about occasional Daredevil nemesis The Punisher instead of the Man Without Fear; the fact that the movie treats this as no big deal suggests that it comes from a more disturbing place than anyone in the Marvel universe could imagine. True Daredevil at least partly deals with Afflecks decision to stop killing but its given all the gravity of a decision to stop smoking or eating fatty snacks. The film seems to want all the trappings of the Daredevil comic-the dripping rooftops the suggestive brooding the Catholic iconography and the ever-present potential for damnation-without the attendant baggage. Suggesting a cross between Ving Rhames and Ed Wood stock-player Tor Johnson Michael Clarke Duncan plays Daredevils arch-foe The Kingpin the pitiless source of most of New Yorks crime and the man whose decision to assassinate the father of Afflecks new lover Elektra (Jennifer Garner) lends the film its late-in-arriving central conflict. Casting Affleck would have paid off had the conflicted acerbic star of Boiler Room Changing Lanes or even Bounce shown up. Instead were left with the cardboard hero of Armageddon and The Sum Of All Fears a caretaker leading man wholly dependent on the quality of the movie around him. Sadly theres not much of that. Johnsons reliance on optical effects and secondhand fight choreography strains Daredevils personality through a Matrix filter and it rarely succeeds on those derivative terms. (Anyone annoyed by shortcomings in Spider-Mans special effects can start working out the wording of their angry Internet posts now.) Thanks to Jon Favreaus turn as Afflecks schlubby partner a funny cameo by Kevin Smith and especially Colin Farrells gleefully psychopathic interpretation of the villain Bullseye at least theres good stuff in the margins. But on the heels of such successful comic-book adaptations as X-Men and Spider-Man Johnsons film makes Daredevil look like the second-rate hero he never really was.

For one thing hes blind (yes like Justice). For another Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck) lawyer by day masked vigilante by night is a tormented brooding guy carrying around a heavy load of Roman Catholic guilt and prescription painkillers. Mistaken for a miscreant on a Manhattan rooftop he protests ""Im not the bad guy"" as much to convince himself as anybody else.""Daredevil"" fashioned by writer-director Mark Steven Johnson from the Marvel comic is an appropriately dark doom-shrouded affair. Its depiction of the accident that cost 12-year-old Matt (Scott Terra) his sight and his discovery that his other senses are working on superhuman levels is both visually sophisticated and emotionally terrifying. But after grabbing our attention with considerable style the movie proceeds slowly but surely to evaporate. The portentous angst of the grown-up Matt doesnt mesh with the generic plot or the campy broad-stroke silliness of the other characters Jennifer Garners Elektra Natchios kung fu expert and billionaire heiress; Colin Farrells flamboyantly fiendish Bullseye; Michael Clarke Duncans cigar-smoking archvillain Kingpin. Torn between moody grandiosity and cartoonish mayhem ""Daredevil"" tries to have it both ways and succeeds at neither.

Comments Daredevil Ben Affleck stars as the Marvel Comics superhero blinded as a child whos developed such extraordinary hearing that he can visualize perfectly whats in front of him (and beat the tar out of it). Comic book characters are shallow by definition a problem that Tim Burtons Batman and Sam Raimis Spider-Man met with offbeat casting and colorful dramatization of the heroes back stories. This dull actioner written and directed by Mark Steven Johnson uses voice-over to hurry along Daredevils genesis tale and Afflecks rigid performance is a perpetual drag on the story. The breezily blasphemous showdown in a Catholic church proves that Johnson--the guy who reduced John Irvings A Prayer for Owen Meany to Simon Birch--hasnt lost his gift for turning wine into water. 103 min.

His blindness is the result of a childhood accident which means chundering through the usual back-story where bad hats despatch his prizefighter dad before we meet Affleck lawyer by day radar-sighted crimefighter in red leathers by night. So far so standard but as he mashes neighbourhood scumbags self-doubt has him wondering if its really for justice or vengeance. When romance strikes with lithely combative Garner the plot manoeuvres him into the lethal orbit of both crime lord Duncan and crackshot Irish assassin Farrell. With its notably tougher violence this lacks the sheer fun factor of Spider-Man yet shies from the follow-through on moral complexity. Convincing in the physical demands of the role Affleck persuades us of the pain of sightlessness and supersensitive hearing although writer/director Johnsons scrappy construction fails him and everyone else as the showdown approaches.

"Daredevil Slate Sign In Sign Up Daredevil Daredevil Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Feb. 14 2003 439 PM Ben in Tights Daredevilsbest stunts are borrowed from Batman. By David Edelstein Affleck Blind like a bat The new Marvel Comics superhero adaptation Daredevil (20th Century Fox) has been getting such an across-the-board critical drubbing that I feel rather daring saying its not that terrible its just kind of lousy and it sends you out feeling dour and mean. The film has a relentlessly gloomy tragic cast Its full of drenching rain urban filth cruel death; it features kids watching their parents get horribly murdered. Its darkness would be sort of cool except it doesnt mesh with the comic-book syntax and the lazy shorthand characterizations. The director and writer Mark Steven Johnson has aimed at once too high and too low. He wants to stir your emotions but he wants to spoon-feed you too--to cut to the emotional chase. He doesnt earn all the grandiose religious symbolism or the anguish. Not with these heavy-handed comic-book frames. Not with a tragic superhero played by Ben Affleck. Advertisement Affleck is Matt Murdock a lawyer for the indigent and wronged who by night dons a red-leather costume with a horned mask and beats up or kills sundry gangsters and rapists whove escaped justice in the courts. He is also blind--which has somehow given him the power to see evil more clearly or at least to hear its heart of darkness throbbing. Daredevil begins with the traumatized gravely wounded hero clinging to the steeple of a cathedral with images of fighting and death coming in near-subliminal blasts. The film flashes back to show how Matt was blinded as a child in an accident splashed by toxic waste while running from his drunken ex-prizefighter dad (David Keith) whom he has just stumbled on roughing up a man at the behest of a gang boss. The horror comes thick and fast but the narration is so primitively straightforward (""I lost my sight but my other four senses were heightened. ... I trained my body. ... I made a silent promise never to give up--to be fearless"") that it makes the original comic seem as expressive as The Odyssey. Hold on the original comic was a little like The Odyssey at least when Frank Miller got hold of it and began playing up the fevered vigilantism that made his Batman series The Dark Knight so riveting. If the spiritual struggle of Daredevil feels familiar its because Sam Hamm and Tim Burton took some of their inspiration from it for the first Batman feature. But Hamm circled back to Batmans heartrending origins more cunningly and Burton--no great comic-book maven--took his visual cues from such Gothic silent horror films as the Lon Chaney Phantom of the Opera (1925) and the work of Fritz Lang and F.W. Murnau. Abetted by Danny Elfmans stirring melancholy score Burton made Batman more sublime for the faint aura of ridiculousness that attended his superheroics. Johnson rips off a lot of Batman especially in the cathedral climax but thats not so bad The movie looks best when it looks like other better movies. The frames are canted like a comic book and packed but theyre not especially expressive and Daredevils powers are curiously elastic. Although he isnt supposed to have supernatural abilities--hes like Batman not Spider-Man--Johnson has him soaring off rooftops in defiance of gravity. The computer-generated animation is more convincing than in last years Spider-Man (the shadows and the darkness help) but it doesnt make the same kind of aesthetic sense. We miss seeing how the Daredevil persona was constructed--how Matt found the power in himself and nurtured it. And Johnson rarely makes it clear how Daredevils other senses compensate for his visual deficiency. The fighting is just standard-issue sub-Hong Kong martial arts only edited so stroboscopically that you cant tell whats happening. The whole movie seems to unfold in some abstract cyberspace in which physical laws have no sway a good place for TheMatrix (1999) but no home for a blind urban lawyer with stigmata and a cane that transforms into a weapon. For the last couple of years Ben Affleck has been working to wipe the smirk off his face and to look as if he isnt part of some colossal scam to convince the American public that hes a movie star. He has been surprisingly successful--he was even compelling in last years Changing Lanes. The problem is that without that smirk he doesnt have much personality. He seems like a good-guy stockbroker; youd want to go out with him for a couple of drinks and some nachos. Hand-to-hand combat in lieu of courtship He works hard in Daredevil to look drawn obsessed grief-stricken but his best moment is his one and only smirk. Its when he sniffs Jennifer Garner (from Alias) in a coffeehouse then trails her outside and engages in martial arts in lieu of a courtship. This is also the movies best Hong Kong moment The fighting is hilariously casual the way it is when Fred and Ginger carry an argument into a dance. Affleck and Garner backward-somersault out of each others way and then hop on top of a seesaw where they take the measure of each others weight. Hes wonderfully cocky and Garner comes alive when she fights--when those long limbs and that almost-beautiful fish face are in motion. Thats the only scene in which Daredevil is surprising larky large-spirited. The romance is otherwise crudely sentimental--especially when Affleck ""sees"" Garner in the rain and her outline swims into the frame with silvery bubbles. The one-note supervillain Wilson Fisk aka the Kingpin is played by Michael Clarke Duncan who gets to do some street-fighting in the climax but is otherwise immobile--huge dead center in the middle of the screen and deadeningly predictable in his lines and gestures. The films wild card is Colin Farrell as Bullseye a hot-dog Irish assassin who kills with knives pencils paper clips even airline peanuts. Farrells a crowd-pleaser (and he seems very pleased with himself) but I was taken aback by the casualness of his murders. Comic-book villains like comic-book heroes need some mythic component--powers that are a poetic extension of their personalities. A wooden good guy fighting a cackling psychopath isnt the best use of the medium They dont seem worthy of their silly costumes. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

"In Daredevil Justice Is Blind washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids On Screen In Daredevil Justice Is Blind Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday February 14 2003 I DONT know. Ben Affleck as a superhero? With his bed-head thatch of tousled hair and crooked smile hes sort of cute Ill grant you. Still he wouldnt have been my first choice to pour into the form-fitting burgundy leather bodysuit of the comic-book crime fighter known as Daredevil a man who jumps off of buildings as easily as most people get up from the couch. But then again I probably wouldnt have cast Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man either and look how it turned out. Didnt see that one coming. Okay so maybe with a little padding Affleck manages to pull ""Daredevil"" off especially since the protagonist of the film based on the Marvel Comics character is Matt Murdock a blind insecure self-doubting lawyer who cant maintain a relationship with a woman and who still hasnt gotten over the death of his father when he was 12. Now theres a role for Affleck. (Actually it sounds more like a role for Philip Seymour Hoffman but thats one actor nobody wants to see in leather.) Focus focus. Ah yes we were talking about ""Daredevil."" Like Affleck himself the film is perfectly satisfactory without being deeply satisfying. Like all comic books it concerns the confrontation between good and evil. On the one side theres Daredevil an attorney whose blindness has caused his other senses to become hypersensitive and whose personal tragedy (and association with our flawed criminal justice system) has caused an acute inflammation of the sense of right and wrong. He is in other words a vigilante albeit an uncommonly effective one beating the stuffing out of those he cannot put in jail the boring legal way. On the other side is the vicious crime lord Wilson Fisk known as the Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan) and his hit man Bullseye (Colin Farrell) a psychotic Irish assassin who kills people by throwing things at them. Thats right pencils broken glass Chinese throwing stars. Actually its less silly and a lot grosser than it sounds. I think Ive developed a permanent nervous tic from flinching at all the ways people get punctured. Things get personal for Matt/Daredevil when Bullseye kills the father of our heros newest lady love a martial arts expert and nurturing child care professional named Elektra (Jennifer Garner). They also get complicated when Daredevil is implicated in the crime. But what makes the film most interesting is really another complication and that is the moral ambiguity of what Matt does in his spare time. ""Im not the bad guy"" he reassures a cowering child who has just witnessed Daredevil in a costume that makes him look like a cross between Batman and Beelzebub pummel someones face into a pulp. Its a nice dark touch for writer-director Mark Steven Johnson to make. I only wish he had made a little more of that kind of figurative chiaroscuro and a lot less of the murky lighting under which most of the hard-to-see action footage was shot. What is this a comic book movie or an art house film? When someone gets his butt kicked I want to see it. But thats just the opinion of a blind self-doubting film critic with his own twisted sense of cinematic right and wrong. DAREDEVIL (PG-13 103 minutes) -- Contains violent combat and sensuality.

"Daredevil Superhero Cant Rescue This One washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Movies Daredevil Superhero Cant Rescue This One Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday February 14 2003 Between ""Daredevil"" and the deep blue sea theres not much difference Both are cold and wet and dark difficult to navigate. The sea may kill you while the movie probably wont but the sea nourishes oysters lobsters crabs Chilean sea bass and Mrs. Pauls fish sticks while ""Daredevil"" only produces indigestion. It must be stated upfront that the movie is certainly the most violent of the comic book superhero genre that oh-so-profitable recent market niche discovered by American FilmCorpIncAmalgamated entities. Its body count is high and the victims mostly get stabbed or slashed to death in ways uncomfortably graphic for its PG-13 rating. Its film noir crossed with psycho fever dreams and it certainly lacks the joy and jokiness of ""Spider-Man."" On the other hand if you like it dark dark is what you get. Its even darker than the better ""Batman"" movies. Ben Afflecks ""DD"" -- he leaves the initials in a flare of burning fuel at the site of his escapes -- is just barely super. In most respects hes quite mortal which means he gets cut up badly (by a chick) he gets a tooth knocked out and his body cross-hatched with scars like an Iwo Jima vets seems bone-tired. Hes a brooder too and the writer-director Mark Steven Johnson whose first big film this is loves to find him in heroic rumination posed against the skyline his body radiating fatigue and existential angst. Hes the only superhero you can imagine knocking off at the end of a day throwing the freakin leather hood into the hamper peeling off the boots and those skintight skin tights collapsing on the sofa in his undies and reaching for a bottle of refreshing brown liquid. He seems human that is to say. Too bad hes the only human thing in the movie. In fact thats another oddity of ""Daredevil"" Everybody eventually turns into something super or mythic and poor Matt Murdock (Affleck) comes to seem the least remarkable of them. Compared with Colin Farrells flagrant impersonation of Charlie Manson on angel dust Afflecks broody narcissism feels undernourished. The film begins as per the Superhero Code section 11-2 Subparagraph B with origins or ""how supe got that way."" Young Matt Murdock of Hells Kitchen N.Y. N.Y. in the recent present learns that his beloved dad (David Keith) whom he thought was a longshoreman is really an enforcer for a mobster. Fleeing the scene of the discovery in emotional disarray he blunders into a barely believable industrial accident during which toxic waste is splashed into his eyes. The evil chemicals take his sight but weirdly amplify his other four senses giving him incredible almost sonar-like hearing acuity. As part of the package the accident also magnifies his coordination and athletic skills. He grows up to be a lawyer by day a masked vigilante by night. His tailor seems to be Tom of Finland and somewhere grad student keyboards are already clickety-clacking away on the important topics this film raises like ""Deviant Sexual Subtexts in Daredevil Leather Hoods Bindings and Oh-Such-Tight-Pants."" But thats another story. In ""Spider-Man"" the project turned on making you believe a boy could swing and conjuring the feeling of the exhilaration of arcing through gravity amid the towers of Gotham. Spider-Man swung like a pendulum do. Daredevils device is somewhat shakier and much less convincing. When he does the locomotion its as old as Tarzans deal with flung wires in place of helpful jungle vines. After the fashion of a gaucho hes a bolo artist continually looping wires or filament to some sort of anchoring projection then swinging A  la Man of the Apes across New Yorks canyons. But so adroit is he at this arcane art the movie proposes hes able to do it in mid-fall. He can jump off a 30-story building and as hes falling sense something (hes blind remember) to lasso fling the filament and catch himself so effortlessly he transmogrifies the dive into a ride. No wonder his body is tired. His joints must be pure spaghetti by this time Maybe you can buy into this; I never could. It seemed preposterous where Spideys web-flinging was at least a movie illusion believable enough to go along with. I know it sounds like a kindergartners query Can Spider-Man swing better than Daredevil? (Answer Yes.) But on such matters turn mighty issues of story enchantment. The plot quickly becomes predictable. Our hero by day losing cases by night takes care of miscreants the sloppy law has let slip. However he meets a babe one Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner of the TV drama ""Alias"") who herself possesses advanced martial skills. For foreplay they immediately try to kick each other in the face. Can true love be far behind? The details that follow are too arbitrary to delineate. Shes the daughter of a billionaire who has been targeted by the evil Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan) who hires an Irish killer named Bullseye (Farrell) to kill her father then her then Daredevil who has begun to sniff out his evil plan. Lots of fights on rooftops happen in that exaggerated modern fashion where youre not sure if what youre seeing takes place in the real place of real space or the no place of cyberspace with all the back-flipping and building-leaping that goes on. Again you never quite believe it. What you believe in however is the charisma of Farrell not quite but soon to be a star. Though hes only in it a bit he dominates those scenes and he does something Affleck cant manage By his presence and demonism he makes you believe his gimmick which is even shakier than the fishing-line swinging of the hero. Bullseye is not a shooter hes a thrower. You wouldnt want to pie-fight him let me tell you because hed kill you. Anything he can pick up is a lethal weapon. He flings throwing stars pencils even peanuts with fatal velocity and precision. He can turn a playing card into a .357 Magnum. Believe it? Not for a second after the movies finished but while hes up there in his brogue doing his creepy punk undulation and wild-eyed rover boy he is convincing. As for Garner well she tries hard in a thankless role. A former ballet student she looks best in movement particularly when she can get those long legs into play. But shes basically pretty bland. The same can be said for Duncan who as a villain is at least liberated from the Mythic Spiritual Negro roles he usually gets. For the most part ""Daredevil"" doesnt take a single dare; it travels the road much trod even if its through the midtown air. Daredevil (115 minutes at area theaters) is surprisingly brutal for its PG-13 rating.

""Daredevil"" is a pretender in the realm of bona fide superheroes. Grimly going through the motions and resembling Marvel stablemate Spider-Man in too many ways this franchise-hungry champion of the underdog brings no sense of fun to his pursuit of bad guys; its just the fate hes stuck with. Charm- and humor-free exercise in pushing commercial buttons will ride a massive marketing push a surfeit of Ben Affleck publicity the current cache of Marvel and audience hopes for Spidey-like thrills to boffo openings. But its unlikely to be a film auds take to heart which spells less than gangbuster biz in the long run. Given that there must be a reason Daredevil has been around as a comic book character since 1964 without ever becoming a household name the filmmakers have been pushing the notion this blind vigilante is a more emotionally accessible and morally complex character than others of his ilk even that the story has a Shakespearean dimension. Somehow that doesnt sound like much of a selling point with the target audience. Sure Matt Murdock was accidentally blinded as a boy and his prizefighter dad was rubbed out by thugs. But he compensated for his loss by becoming fearless and acquiring ""super-human sharpness"" in his remaining four senses. Matt can sense the proximity of others and detect movements via heartbeats vibrations and so on and can bounce down the sides of buildings in his Hells Kitchen neighborhood with more speed and dexterity than Spider-Man himself. Like Peter Parker Matt has family loss to avenge comes out at night to take on neighborhood toughs and sees his secret identity threatened by the fourth estate (occasioning endless plugs for the New York Post which in a fantasy designed to please Rupert Murdoch here appears to be the only newspaper in Gotham). He even shares his first kiss with his inamorata in the rain at night. So much for originality. Writer-director Mark Steven Johnson attacks the story with the single-minded laboriousness of a military campaign and just as loudly. With Daredevil seemingly on the brink of death his life flashes before his sightless eyes. After a nearly 20-minute recap of Matts trauma-packed youth pic intros Affleck as an attorney who after losing a case and watching a rapist go free dons form-fitting burgundy-colored leather gear to dispense justice. Retribution takes place at a sleazy nightclub and not only is the action incoherently staged with enormous jump cuts that flaunt the utter lack of spatial reality but Daredevils ferocious assault represents overkill given the countless deaths that ensue from his targeting of one man. What kind of hero is this? Admitting his sins in confession Matt is chastised by his priest who then adds that ""Im not too crazy about the outfit either""; the little cap with horn-like points brings the devil to mind. After meeting in a cafe Matt hits it off with beauteous Greek shipping heiress Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner) in a strenuous martial arts set-to in a Manhattan playground. Here and much more later on pic makes use of the talents of Hong Kong action choreographer Cheung Yan Yuen (""Charlies Angels"") to push the combat into reduced gravity zones with results more calculated than thrilling. Looking fresher are the techniques employed by the convincingly cartoonish hit man Bullseye played with nasty relish by Colin Farrell. Shaven-headed extensively pierced and with a dartboard-like target carved on his forehead Bullseye can fling any small seemingly harmless projectile with literally deadly accuracy. Bullseye is called in by Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan) a business tycoon whos actually the criminal overlord of New York City to dispense with Elektras father (Erick Avari) after hes shown the bad judgment of pulling out of a deal. Bullseye makes it look as though Daredevil killed Elektras dad making further romance tough and setting her on a vengeful path just when Matt/Daredevil has bought into his priests view that violence should not be answered by further violence. This conviction lasts about five minutes as a nocturnal rooftop struggle involving Daredevil Elektra and Bullseye is just the first of three battles to settle matters once and for all. Expressing a conflicted and disturbed personality throughout Affleck sweats bleeds and suffers through his paces as a guy uncomfortable in his skin and probably in his costume. Thesp has the rugged physical presence for the role and brings a degree of lightness to his scenes with Matts comic-relief law partner (Jon Favreau) but doesnt project a private enthusiasm at playing a superhero. In her first bigscreen co-starring role ""Alias"" sensation Garner has no trouble holding her own. After sporting a big cigar and fancy threads to maintain an air of utter respectability the mighty Duncan finally gets down in a climactic fight scene. Director Kevin Smith puts in a brief appearance as a forensic specialist. Visually Johnson and lenser Ericson Core keep things very dark placing the action in a mostly nocturnal and desaturated urban jungle that recalls Alex Proyas work in ""The Crow"" and ""Dark City"" without the stylistic elan. Pic is filled with the usual contemporary mannerisms but absent any new moves. Barry Chusids production design skillfully blends locations sets and computer-created backdrops in virtually monochromatic harmony and effects are sharp; shots of Daredevil careening around buildings are actually more graceful and naturalistic than comparable moments in ""Spider-Man"" and presentation of his ""Shadow-World"" via visualized sonar-like waves is effective. The heaviness of Graeme Revells score is surpassed by the noxious aggressiveness of some of the heavy rock laid on the soundtrack.

This is a movie that desperately needs the presence of Smiths trademark sidekicks Jay and Silent Bob with Smith as Bob ragging worse than ever on his old pal Ben Affleck. Ben Affleck is a blind lawyer by day and costumed crime-fighter by night in the lackluster Daredevil. Then again therell be plenty of ragging to go around once audiences get a dose of the dullest live-action comic strip on record one that lacks even an interesting villain. The baddie its stuck with is a behemoth named The Kingpin played without a hint of idiosyncratic flair by Michael Clarke Duncan. The only fun comes from trying to guess how much fabric it would take to construct one of Duncans spiffy suits. His jacket size must be something like a 160-long. Blinded since childhood by toxic waste (it makes you wonder whether the movie could have the same effect) Afflecks Matt Murdock labors as an attorney. At night when most scenes take place he dons a heros Daredevil mask and pretty much looks like a fool. Review of the movie Daredevil ( out of four) Stars Ben Affleck Jennifer Garner Michael Clarke Duncan Colin Farrell Jon Favreau Joe Pantoliano Director Mark Steven Johnson Distributor 20th Century Fox Rating PG-13 for action/violence and sensuality Opens Friday nationwide Love interest Elektra is played by Jennifer Garner. No matter how lockjawed her dialogue deliveries her dimples still indent which is even more impressive than Duncans girth. The two leads show their love for each other by engaging in Matrix-like punches flights and flips already a movie cliche before the second Matrix pic can even make it into theaters. One early fight sequence is so dark fuzzy and impersonal that the participants look like video-game combatants which might be the point given the target audience. There is none of the casting ingenuity pacing production design or subliminally stirring emotional dysfunction that made Spider-Man work though writer/director Mark Steven Johnson does try to tack on a religious dimension. Even when key characters die it doesnt make much difference in the great scheme of things as if this picture were assembled skillfully enough to have a scheme of things. Colin Farrell comes off best (certainly better than Duncan or Affleck) as a crazed hit man; at least the design on his forehead is unique. Cast as Afflecks law partner is Jon Favreau from cables engaging Dinner for Five. Once the word starts getting around on this movie the makers will be lucky if they manage to escape a period of dining at tables for one.

Daredevil (Ben Affleck) makes a fiery entrance in the film ""Daredevil."" Photo HO Daredevil has tin ear for casting / Ben Affleck wrong man to play afflicted brooding comics hero 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Daredevil Action drama. Starring Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner. Directed by Mark Steven Johnson. (PG-13. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Daredevil"" is an action blockbuster thats one of the biggest misfires in its genre since ""Godzilla"" almost five years ago. Based on Stan Lee s comic book series it takes sunny uncomplicated Ben Affleck and casts him as a dark tormented figure. Affleck is no Heathcliff and hes no Robert Mitchum. He can play one thing -- a genial guy with a sense of humor. Cast as something else Affleck is still funny but not on purpose. ""Daredevil"" is misguided down the line despite the casting of TV star Jennifer Garner whose performance here as an action heroine is credible but thankless. Writer-director Mark Steven Johnson seems to have tried to do two things replicate the comics nightmarish atmosphere while injecting notes of self-mocking humor one associates with comic books and lazy screenplays. But the right tone eludes him. ""Daredevil"" ends up in a dead zone where the jokes are ugly and the attempts at seriousness come across as absurd or bizarre. Maybe this is one comic book that should have stayed a comic book. Rendered literally Daredevils gimmick might be too far-fetched for anything but the most extreme cartoon treatment As a boy Matt Murdock is blinded in an accident involving chemical waste. But the accident causes his hearing to become so acute that he acquires a radar-like ability. By the time we meet him as an adult in his Daredevil incarnation his inner radar has become so developed that he can dive off the roof of his Manhattan apartment building bounce off scaffolds and swing from cables to the ground. The stairs would have been too easy. When hes not avenging crimes in his Daredevil costume Matt works as a prosecutor which puts him in daily contact with criminals who go free. His frustration at the justice system makes Daredevil potentially interesting. He is not about solving crimes. Hes a lethally angry man whose entire focus is on punishment. In an early scene a rapist who is found not guilty ends up thanks to Daredevil on a train track in the New York subway system. ""That light at the end of the tunnel"" Daredevil tells him ""its not heaven -- its the C train"" Much could have been made of the clash between the mild face Matt Murdock shows the world and the towering rage that governs his inner life. (Who knows Afflecks geniality might have been an asset.) But the director backs off and doesnt explore his heros rage. Affleck may growl like Alec Baldwin in the voice-over narration but thats as tough as he gets. Administering suffering he has none of the gusto of a vigilante but seems merely like any nice guy in a somber frame of mind. Writer-director Johnsons tendency to go soft also characterizes the treatment of Matts love interest Elektra (Garner) who in the comic book was a paid assassin. Here shes the daughter of a billionaire businessman a strong assertive young woman who were to understand is a feminist because she practices martial arts. When her father is killed by an underworld associate Elektra trains harder for an encounter with his assassin kicking sandbags and waving daggers. Two words of advice might have really helped target practice. As the evil nemesis Bullseye -- a paid killer who flings sharp objects with expert aim -- Colin Farrell seems to be the only one having any fun. His looseness and mania make him hard not to watch. Some of that anarchy that what-will-he-do-next quality was rightfully Daredevils and should have been part of Afflecks characterization. Or maybe its just that Farrell should have had the lead role. In between playing it safe the writer-director indulges in off-putting humor which hardly seems daring just clueless. In one scene a jabbering old lady is killed. Her death is the punch line. Johnson expects us to laugh at that and yet keep a straight face when Daredevil comes home all morose after a hard day killing people to contemplate his place in the universe. If anything thats funny. Genuinely dark plot turns in one scene give way to superhero nonsense in the next until were left with the inescapable impression of a filmmaker in free fall with no scaffolding cables or collaborator to save him. The extent of Johnsons flailing becomes apparent in a shameless voice-over reference to New York as a ""city born of heroes."" Veiled it may be but chalk that up as the first movie blockbuster reference to Sept. 11. Expect more. The more veiled the better. . This film contains graphic violence.

He swoops through the cityscape in the dead of night whacking slimeballs with his fancy billy club. He wears a pointy-eared cowl. And hes got Ben Afflecks dimpled chin.Daredevil based on Marvel Comics sight-impaired superhero - a blind man whose remaining senses are preternaturally fine-tuned - has been brought to the screen with a mix of jaunty humor and jagged violence that should have worked more effectively than it does.Mark Steven Johnson the writer-director (Simon Birch his adaptation of John Irvings A Prayer for Owen Meany was his debut) artfully dispenses with the origin of Daredevils powers (a childhood head-on with biohazardous materials) and his troubled relationship with a pugilist dad (David Keith). Affleck reportedly a longtime Daredevil aficionado is better than youd think as the Matt Murdock-alias-Double-D fellow. (Murdock is an upright attorney who does more pro bono work than Cher when she was still in love with Sonny.)Although a lot of Afflecks costume time is actually the stuff of stunt doubles and digital animation he brings conviction and that chin to the role.Comic book buffs too will appreciate all the Marvel bullpen name-dropping that Daredevil does and a quick walking-down-the-sidewalk cameo from the comic companys godhead writer-editor Stan Lee.So why isnt Daredevil more satisfying? Well after sundry Batmans and last summers Spider-Man the comic-book formula of childhood loss filial revenge and freakish physical prowess doesnt seem all that fresh anymore. And while Daredevil is a more interesting character in many regards than Gotham Citys closet fetishist the villains in Johnsons movie are decidedly run-of-the-mill. Colin Farrell the Irish actor whose publicists are doing a better job of star-making than his own performances plays Bullseye an expert dartsman with a target branded into his forehead. Good aim and demonic leers do not a bad guy make.The hulking froggy-throated Michael Clarke Duncan is the movies real baddie an underworld kingpin in a neatly tailored business suit. But massive musculature doesnt necessarily translate to screen menace even when the bodyguard-turned-thespian starts tossing Daredevil around his office like a basketball.The film is at its best when Murdock and Daredevil spar - physically and romantically - with Elektra Natchios a name that brings Mexican foodstuffs to mind (and to the screenplay) and who is played with frisky kick-boxing elan by Jennifer Garner. TVs super-buff Alias star wields daggers and deadly glares with equal aplomb and she and Affleck generate as they say in the biz heat.But alas Daredevil itself isnt all that hot.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.Daredevil  1/2 (Out of four stars)Produced by Arnon Milchan Gary Foster and Avi Arad written and directed by Mark Steven Johnson photography by Ericson Core music by Graeme Revell distributed by Twentieth Century Fox.Running time 1 hour 43 mins.Matt Murdock/Daredevil. . .

"Problem Is The Action Never Stops - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Kingpin Problem Is The Action Never StopsMovies - REVIEW - DaredevilDaredevil Is Fun But A Little Emotional Heft Would Have Been Nice. But There Is No Time.February 14 2003|By Jay Boyar Sentinel Movie CriticWho is that up there swinging and swooping above the city?Spider-Man? No. Spideys mask doesnt have little horns.Batman then? Not him either. Batman has horns -- or at least little peaks -- but he has never been seen in red leather.Not in the line of duty anyway.The new kid on the block -- above the block really -- is Daredevil a k a the ""Man Without Fear."" Hero of the dark-toned action picture of the same name hes swinging into theaters today clad in crimson sporting those devils horns and played by Peoples ""sexiest man alive"" the buff square-jawed Ben Affleck.The Daredevil comic book was co-created in the early 1960s for Marvel Comics by writer-honcho Stan Lee and artist Bill Everett. Although derivative of both Marvels Spider-Man and DCs Batman Daredevil has a distinctive gimmickHe is blind.This doesnt slow him down as much as you would think. The accident that takes the sight of a kid named Matt Murdock also leaves his other senses heightened and gives him a special ""radar sense."" As he grows up to become Daredevil by night and an attorney by day he finds hes able to sense the presence of objects around him.All of this is laid out very early in the film in a brisk origin tale that centers on young Matt (Scott Terra) and his father (David Keith) a prizefighter with mob problems. This lurid intro taps into the cheap thrills of two kinds of B-movies offering both the blunt punch of boxing pictures and the creepy tingle of sci-fi thrillers.The Champ meets The Fly you might say.As we move into the present we find our hero up against a crime boss called Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan) and Kingpins top assassin Bullseye (Colin Farrell) a marksman with near-perfect aim. Also in the mix is Elektra (Jennifer Garner of TVs Alias) an ace martial artist whose feelings for the ""Man Without Fear"" might be called love-hate.Director-writer Mark Steven Johnson (Simon Birch) a self-described ""comic-book geek"" has come up with an effective visual style to present the ghostly blue-and-black radar-sense world through which Daredevil deftly maneuvers.Even more important Johnson keeps the momentum going all the way through this movie. The action almost never stops which is both Daredevils biggest asset and its greatest shortcoming.That action is excitingly staged and well-paced but it doesnt leave room for much else. And yet the geek in Johnson still insists on crowding in themes from nearly four decades of comic-book history.These include the idea of the daring devil as a sort of justice-obsessed avenging angel. Theres also more than a dash of vampire-cum-Christian mythology. (Some comic-book geeks by the way may feel that Johnson is a tad too fond of scenes in which the heros secret identity is revealed.)In addition to Daredevil and his trio of adversaries we also meet Matts jovial law partner (Jon Favreau of Swingers) and the intrepid tabloid reporter (Joe Pantoliano) on Daredevils trail.All of this is reasonably imaginative. And it seems fitting that the movies ebony mood is closer to that of the 1989 Batman than to the more light-hearted spirit of last years Spider-Man.The problem is that as in X-Men of 2000 theres simply too much going on. After that ""origin"" intro nothing carries enough emotional weight.Even most of the performances get lost in the rush including Afflecks much-anticipated star turn. Half the time he seems to be thinking about something else.Wedding plans perhaps?Grinning at his own villainy Duncan (The Green Mile) as the king-sized Kingpin breaks though the tumult. So does Farrell (The Recruit) as Bullseye although he has the help of the target on his forehead to focus our attention.The movie focuses our attention too but misses a larger target. The ""Man Without Fear"" is sometimes boxed in by the Movie Without Pause.

Rick Groen Globe and Mail Update Published Friday Feb. 14 2003 855AM EST Last updated Wednesday Apr. 22 2009 1024AM EDT Comments AA Daredevil Directed and written by Mark Steven Johnson Starring Ben Affleck Jennifer Garner Colin Farrell Classification AA Rating 1/2 Forget about graphic novels theyll always be comic books to you. And you read them eagerly back then in the innocence of childhood when their kiddie myths spoke directly to your kiddie hopes and kiddie fears. Then you got older and put away childish things not reluctantly but in the excited throes of discovery -- there were more enlightening words to read and they didnt come with balloons around them. For a brief decade or so you made your cultural choices from a grownup menu and childish things were what they should be -- the exclusive domain of the young the rightful property of little children. Then you grew older still and perhaps a little regretful -- old enough and regretful enough to start idealizing your youth. And somehow the entire pop culture followed suit getting nostalgic and infantalized until your childish past became an ongoing present and like it or not resist it or not you were imprisoned in the kingdom of kiddiedom. Many hold the keys to that kingdom but none is larger than the one wielded by Hollywood. It makes expensive movies out of those old comic books out of every pulp man with a preface before his name -- Super or Bat or Spider. Bombarded by ads by billboards by press you are obliged to consider these movies and to treat them with the lively seriousness that their lavish budgets command. Not to do so is to be unfashionably old in a culture thats forever young. Not to revel in a childish past is to seem past it -- an anachronism a coot. Daredevil was and is a comic book -- originated back in the sixties by that Marvel-man himself the prolific Stan Lee. And now the comic has exercised its inalienable right to morph into a feature film. This particular hero suits up right along with the others -- the costume may be different but the cloth is sure the same. Like them he has a dual identity Matt Murdock the storefront lawyer by day Daredevil the crusading vigilante by night. Like them hes an orphan whose emergent powers have a point of vulnerability Due to a childhood accident Daredevil is blind much like the justice he metes out. And like them he works the city Big bad Gotham where crime is rife where tall buildings can be leapt from in a single bound and where rooftops glimmer under the stolen light of the silver moon. Like them too he is conflicted carrying within him the seeds of good and evil. So not all his blooms are benign. For example hes in mid-dalliance with his love-interest Elektra when much to his annoyance crime-fighting duty calls forcing him to choose between doing good and doing Elektra. What happens? Lets just say the crooks catch a break that night. This and other slight falls from grace are meant to make our Daredevil seem human and imperfect and thus by comic-book standards a figure of Dostoyevskian complexity. Since comic-book standards are increasingly the only yardstick in town youre left to take your Crime and Punishment where you can find it. In keeping with the tradition established by his predecessors Daredevil must be played by a star of some wattage -- in this case by Ben Affleck who with the usual help from the special-effects wizards has the task of convincing you that blindness is a trifling handicap more than compensated for by a prodigious enhancement of the other senses. Yes thanks to his extraordinary hearing Daredevil can echo-locate like a Stealth bomber. Courtesy of his acute smell he can nose out a foul deed a mile away. Apparently about the only thing he cant do is comb his chronically dishevelled hair yet that just makes Ben all the cuter. But back to the foul deed-doers without whom no hero could be super and no comic book complete. Principal among them is Bullseye (Colin Farrell) so nicknamed because of the target tattooed on his forehead and his unerring way with a hurled missile. Something sharp is his weapon of choice but any pointed object will do in a pinch -- the guys hell with a paper clip. And since Bullseye is not in the least conflicted he makes for one formidable opponent. So does the curvaceous Elektra (Jennifer Garner) who can really kick ass when shes not wiggling it. Not that it matters. The course of true love can never run smooth in kiddie-comic land. Crusading superheroes like their boy-child admirers are sexual adolescents doomed to live in those neighbouring states of permanent arousal and perpetual frustration -- yearning and even yearned for but with ultimate bliss always a promise just out of reach. No wonder that Daredevils only nocturnal companion is his sensory deprivation chamber -- the single place where his raging faculties can find some rest. Anyway you have seen and now you must judge. But your judgment cannot be adult and absolute as in Its a comic for gods sake how good can it be? No your judgment must be sophomoric and relative as in How does this cinematic comic compare with those other screen editions? And several of them have looked quite impressive because a culture gets infantalized by the generous investment not only of money but also of talent. Many gifted directors have taken up the kiddie reins; ironically comic-book adaptations are really an auteurs medium -- they demand a deft visual hand with an imaginative touch. So on to the question at issue Can Daredevil assume pride of place alongside the first Superman and the original Batman and the recent Spiderman? It could have if Mark Steven Johnson were a gifted director. Instead hes just competent as is the flick -- not woeful not wonderful merely watchable. That leaves you to reach into your satchel of stars and pick out 1/2 -- the going rate for competence. And then you append the mark -- the little stars the readers help-mate -- in the assigned place much as your grade-school teacher did when you were a boy of 10 way back in the sad old days when childish things were the purview of children long before a fun-loving culture had mastered the fine art of never growing up.

Running time 96 minutes. Rated PG-13 (action violence some sexuality). At the Empire the Union Square the Harlem USA others. DAREDEVIL"" the blind hero of this poor mans ""Batman"" played by Ben Affleck in autopilot mode and a red leather suit has had his other senses so heightened he has to sleep in a sensory deprivation tank. Alas you may feel like youve spent an hour and half soaking in such a device after sitting through Mark Steven Johnsons mind-numbing would-be comic-book franchise which often seems as blind as its hero - not to mention deaf and dumb. Someones lack of confidence in writer-director Johnsons storytelling is betrayed by the lengthy voice-over narration that opens the movie. A seemingly dying Daredevil relates a lengthy series of flashbacks recalling how Matt Murdock (played as a youngster by Scott Terra) a bullied Hells Kitchen teenager was blinded by an accident - which somehow enhanced his hearing so much it now functions as a kind of sonar. Later his father dockworker Jack ""The Devil"" Murdock (David Keith) a washed-up boxer trying to make a comeback is killed by the mob when he refuses to take a dive. Its fun to imagine how many times Affleck an Oscar-winning screenwriter (for ""Good Will Hunting"") had to read corny lines like ""I waited outside for my father. In some sense Im still waiting"" without breaking up. As the grown-up Matt a pro bono lawyer who likes to proclaim ""justice is blind"" Affleck dons Daredevils ridiculous horned suit to go on vigilante patrol - and our first impulse is to wonder if he has a Daredevil-mobile with matching red upholstery. Nearly half the film is over before the story gets rolling - and we finally see Elektra (Jennifer Garner) a Greek-American heiress whom Matt meets cute in a playground martial arts duel. Unfortunately Affleck and Garner the star of TVs ""Alias"" exhibit no chemistry together after this first encounter - even though the film pays homage to ""Spider-Man"" with a soggy love scene set in the rain. After Elektras tycoon father (Eric Avari a fixture in Adam Sandler films) is killed in a mob hit that Daredevil is unfairly blamed for she turns into an avenger herself - but in this case mourning definitely doesnt become Elektra. Hong Kongs Cheung Yan Yuen was brought in to choreograph the ""Matrix""-style fights but theyre so badly lit choppily edited and digitally enhanced that they dont have a whole lot of impact. Director Johnson (""Simon Birch"") wastes a good cast including Michael Clarke Duncan as chief baddie Kingpin who turns out to be about as menacing as the Jolly Green Giant. Also on board with little to do are Jon Favreau as Matts lawyer partner and Joe Pantoliano as a remarkably mild-mannered reporter for The Post. (This newspaper is also represented by numerous front pages and an accident involving a Post truck on what is unmistakably a Los Angeles street unconvincingly being passed off as Manhattan.) Affleck who can be a fine actor in small character-based films like ""Changing Lanes"" reverts to the condescending frat-boy smirk he usually reserves for his work in big-budget blockbusters. Not so Colin Farrell who delivers some much-needed pizazz in his tiny role as Kingpins multi-pierced henchman Bullseye who can turn paper clips pencils and even shards of stained glass into deadly weapons. Its Farrells gleeful villainy - delivered for once in his native Irish brogue rather than his usual fake-American accent - and his climactic battle with our red-clad hero in a church (that literally has bats in the belfry) that keeps ""Daredevil"" from being a total snooze. The flick misses the bulls-eye by such a length that nobody except hard-core fanboys and leather fetishists will be panting for the promised sequel.

But in the end Ben Affleck cant make us forget that other red-costumed New York superhero. Andrew OHehir Follow Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies Entertainment News Almost every comic-book superhero no matter how convoluted and lame his back story may be is bound for the big screen. This is not really a problem. Comic books traffic in exactly the kind of stark moral dramas and unjaded boyish enthusiasm at which Hollywood spectacles excel; its a natural fit. If anything the comics medium is more serious about matters of life and death more philosophically and socially engaged than most of the crappy movies-by-committee cranked out by American studios. For all the star power and alleged sex appeal of its leading couple however the silver-screen debut of Marvel Comics Daredevil is exactly the kind of middling watchable semiboring action movie thats likely to turn the public away from guys in Spandex with finely honed super-tingly-radioactive-sonar powers. I dont mean to disrespect Daredevils many loyal fans here. But lets face it Despite his blindness he has always been the other New York regular-guy Marvel superhero in a red suit and this flick (adapted by director Mark Steven Johnson from the characters created by Bill Everett Stan Lee and Frank Miller) doesnt do much to close the Spidey gap. Johnsons ""Daredevil"" is often strikingly pretty in an abstract drifty almost sculptural way. We see Ben Affleck in his beefiest most impassive mode brooding above the synthetic Manhattan nightscape like an architectural gargoyle albeit one clad in a maroon leatherette suit that looks like it was made out of the couch my divorced dad had in his suburban apartment circa 1977. Affleck and ""Alias"" star Jennifer Garner dont generate much heat in their scenes together -- they seem more like chums or virginal grade-school sweethearts than lovers. But theyre such extraordinary physical specimens its an undeniable pleasure to watch them suck face in the rain or pound each other senseless. Garner is all unlikely sharp angles and spectacular cheekbones while theres something curvaceous almost androgynous about Afflecks helium-charged pecs and shoulders. Presumably however Johnson and his collaborators are not pursuing some mock-Warhol vision of avant-garde celebrity-fueled emptiness. There are efforts to tell a story in ""Daredevil"" but theyre pretty clueless as if the filmmakers were only remotely familiar with the standard techniques of either comic books or movies. Terrible things befall Daredevil largely as a result of his own freelance vigilante crime-fighting. But the movie seems oblivious sticking to its rhythm of strike-a-pose moments interspersed with murky digital effects and Hong Kong-style fight sequences all edited into a brain-melting blur and set to an assortment of nu-metal and hip-hop singles. ""Daredevil"" begins agreeably enough with the obligatory origin myth explaining how young Matt Murdock (played as a kid by Scott Terra) growing up in Manhattans Hells Kitchen is blinded in a freak accident involving nuclear waste. (That stuff was all over the streets of New York in the 80s apparently.) The toxic goo leaves Matts other four senses ultraheightened so he can use a kind of sonar-radar technique -- an especially splashy visual effect -- to ""see"" the people and places around him. After his ex-boxer hoodlum dad (David Keith) gets bumped off for trying to go straight Matt realizes he must devote his life to kicking the asses of white dudes with dubious facial hair wearing knit caps and work jeans. (This is one of those movies where the bad guys look like the outfoxed intruders in a burglar-alarm commercial.) You Might Also Like When we fast-forward to this movies version of New York in the present (mostly shot on a Los Angeles soundstage; at least its not Toronto) ""Daredevil"" begins to spin its wheels in the narrative mud. Matt is a stylin blind lawyer by day (""Its not right -- another rapist back on the street"") maroon-couch-leatherette-wearing vigilante by night (the rapist gets his along with an entire barroom full of those burglar-alarm white guys). He meets Elektra (Garner) who is both a hottie and a zillionaires daughter after well smelling her across a crowded coffee shop. If thats not icky enough he stalks her to a nearby playground where they proceed apropos of nothing to kung-fu each other half to death. Young love. The future Mr. J.Lo has never been the most expressive actor around and between the couch-suit and the scripts dopey imitations of comic-book monologue (""Can one man make a difference? There are days when I believe and others when I have lost all faith"") neither Matt nor his alter ego has much of a personality. Daredevil is supposedly pursuing a crime lord called the Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan) and as the movie pokes along he sure accumulates lots of reasons to bring him down but Matt seems more depressed and gloomy than angry or passionate. Duncan is an imposing physical presence as always but hes not a strong enough actor to turn his underwritten role into a compelling villain. Sometimes he seems like a cuddly George Foreman type and sometimes he seems to be auditioning for the role of Stanley Kowalski in a community-theater ""Streetcar Named Desire."" Good money was spent hiring the likes of Jon Favreau and Joe Pantoliano to kill time around the fringes of this film but the only performance I really enjoyed was that of Colin Farrell as a leather-clad dart-throwing Irish psychopath named Bullseye. Alone among the cast Farrell seems to understand that this movie -- which is lazy and stoned for all its loud music -- needed somebody to go ape-shit to pretend to give a crap or at least to have fun.

"As derring-do it really doesnt - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMovies | MOVIE REVIEW As derring-do it really doesntWhile Daredevils title role proves to be a snug fit for Ben Affleck the movie itself sags in all the wrong places.February 14 2003|Kenneth Turan | Times Staff Writer Ben Affleck is the most perplexing of movie stars the parts hes been in havent necessarily suited him or made him seem comfortable. Until now.As the blind ""Daredevil"" overmatched defense attorney by day fearless vigilante crusader for justice by night Affleck is surprisingly at home with the humorlessness the implacability even the sullen obtuseness of a driven comic book superhero. Who knew?Despite this casting coup ""Daredevil"" is still more notable for its costumes than its drama. Affleck is a vision in maroon leather so snug and supple even the kindly neighborhood padre gulps and says ""Im not too crazy about the outfit."" Co-star Jennifer Garner looks equally fetching in a stretchy vinyl ensemble made of something called pleather that features a bodice with built-in sword sheaths. Even ""Olgas House of Shame"" was never like this.Arriving in the brief window after ""Spider-Man"" and before the arrival of ""X-Men 2"" and ""The Hulk"" (and you thought sophisticated adult drama was dead) ""Daredevil"" is trying to position itself the press material insists as ""the most morally complex comic book movie ever made."" One of the producers even considers it ""an almost Shakespearean story"" but hey thats Hollywood for you.What morally complex translates to on screen is multiple beatings (""Ive made sure he takes a lot of punishment"" boasts writer-director Mark Steven Johnson) and big gulps of portentous dialogue. ""Can one man make a difference?"" Daredevil agonizes. ""There are days when I believe and others when I have lost all faith."" Most nights he pops some pain pills and takes a hot shower allowing steaming water to massage his rippling muscles. Let Shakespeare try to match that.Is it any wonder then that Daredevil isnt doing so well in the long-term-relationship department. We hear a certain Heather break up with him via message machine complaining that their romance wasnt going to make it to the next level. But for a guy who sleeps in a coffin-like lidded water flotation tank who can even guess what the next level might be?Life wasnt always like this for Daredevil who grew up in the Hells Kitchen section of Manhattan as Matt Murdock a scrappy kid whose father was the even scrappier but morally suspect boxer Jack ""The Devil"" Murdock (David Keith).Then came the unspeakable accident. It cost the young man his sight but had unforeseen compensations Matts remaining senses were pumped up to superhuman sharpness allowing him to do Spider-Man-type maneuvers while playing without a web. Most impressive of all Matts sense of hearing features a kind of radar enabling him as illustrated via a nifty laser scanner-derived effects system called Shadow World to move in ways that the sighted would envy.This ability comes in especially handy when after an hour of marking time with his comic-relief legal partner Franklin ""Foggy"" Nelson (Jon Favreau unsuccessfully trying not to look embarrassed) Daredevil finally meets The Girl.That would be the fetching killing machine Elektra Natchios played by ""Alias "" Garner and easily the films most charismatic presence. She and Daredevil immediately square off in a charming getting-to-know-you martial arts pas de deux choreographed by Hong Kong and ""Charlies Angels"" veteran Yuen Cheung-yan. Unfortunately Garner doesnt have as much screen time as her prominence in the advertising would indicate ""Daredevil"" has a hard time staying alive when shes not on the scene.Because if ""Daredevil"" seemed serious for a comic book it is uninterestingly cartoonish for a movie. Its villains from Michael Clarke Duncans plus-sized Kingpin through Colin Farrells over-the-top Bullseye have a shopworn air about them and the scripts dialogue and situations have generic written all over them.That ""Daredevil"" should turn out to be neither daring nor devilish is somewhat of a surprise because filmmaker Johnson has been a washed-in-the-blood fan since he was a child. Not the obvious choice because of the nature of his previous work (writing both ""Grumpy"" and ""Grumpier Old Men"" and writing and directing the egregiously sentimental ""Simon Birch"") he impressed the producers with his knowledge of and zeal for the material.Maybe its that zeal that turned out to be the problem. Maybe the comic book mythos is so firmly entrenched in Johnsons head that he doesnt see that his screen version is only sporadically involving and not really compelling to those without that previous interest. This is Daredevils world after all where things do not have a habit of working out as planned.DaredevilMPAA rating PG-13 for action/violence and some sensualityTimes guidelines Mild by the standards of the genreBen Affleck...Matt Murdock/DaredevilJennifer Garner...ElektraColin Farrell...BullseyeMichael Clarke Duncan...KingpinJon Favreau...Franklin NelsonTwentieth Century Fox and Regency Enterprises present in association with Marvel Enterprises Inc. a New Regency/Horseshoe Bay production released by Twentieth Century Fox.

"Fizzle. - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs ZAP BANGFizzle.Daredevil starts fast but our hero lacks marvel""DAREDEVIL"" (star)(star)February 14 2003|By Michael Wilmington Tribune movie critic.""Daredevil""--which stars Ben Affleck as yet another Marvel Comics hero--is a blockbuster wannabe that seems to touch all bases zapping us in scene after scene with charismatic stars ultra-glitzy production heart-pumping rock music and lots of rock-em-sock-em action. But ""Daredevil"" lacks the spectacle and sense of fun and dynamism of a movie like ""Spider-Man""-- even though thats what its makers obviously want it to be and even though its hero in many ways is just as interesting and vulnerably human a creation.That hero is a blind Hells Kitchen lawyer named Matt Murdock who defends the underprivileged by day and soars by night as the masked red-suited crime-fighter Daredevil. Affleck plays Murdock/Daredevil and unlike Tobey Maguire in ""Spider-Man"" or Michael Keaton in 1989s ""Batman"" Affleck looks more like a hero when hes out of his costume than he does wearing it.As lawyer Matt Affleck is breezy and sexy a big self-confident and irreverent guy who flirts with beautiful women and puts down pompous snobs and villains. As Daredevil a tortured hero in a tight red rubbery-looking outfit he seems a bit thick and lumbering. And so does the movie.""Daredevil"" starts off fast and snappy like another hip spectacular comic book epic but it lacks the storytelling verve of the better super-hero movies like Tim Burtons ""Batman"" and Sam Raimis ""Spider-Man."" Those pictures played with our sense of wonder or nostalgia--and so in a way did that other recent Marvel Comics movie ""X-Men."" They were fun to watch because of the loving way they elaborated the old pop myths of the super-hero crime fighters and their bizarre origins and peculiar lives.""Daredevil"" starts off that way. Writer-director Mark Steven Johnson and star Affleck are both fans of the longtime Stan Lee comic and theyve lovingly reproduced its origin story and a lot of its characters. Jennifer Garner (of ""Alias"") plays the martial arts princess Elektra Natchios Jon Favreau (of ""Swingers"") is Matts comic lawyer/sidekick Franklin ""Foggy"" Nelson Michael Clarke Duncan acts the evil ganglord Wilson Fisk/a.k.a. Kingpin and Colin Farrell steals the whole movie in a full-out hambone performance as maniacal knife-throwing hit man Bullseye.But though it tries hard theres something ugly and chaotic about ""Daredevil."" The pace of the dialogue is too slow and over-emphatic and many of the scenes have a perfunctory feel like comic-book panels redrawn too many times.Maybe devotion to a comic book hero isnt enough. Johnson immerses us in the Daredevil fantasy world (one curiously reminiscent here of ""Gangs of New York""). We first see Matt as a Hells Kitchen kid (Scott Terra) stung into a life of vengeance by the murder of his dad Jack an aging boxer on the comeback trail who defies the Mobs demand that he throw a crucial fight. When Jack is killed young Matt--blinded earlier in an accident--swears to avenge him.Devoting himself to intense physical and mental regimen Matt grows up into a socially conscious lawyer and masked crime fighter--all the while seeking his dads killers. Eventually he joins forces with Elektra a martial artist powerhouse whose father (Erick Avari) is another murder victim but who wrongly believes Daredevil was responsible.Its a typical Daredevil story the kind that original writer Lee or 70s-80s writer-artist Frank Miller could have knocked off superbly in a couple issues. Thats the problem a movie needs more. Most of the comic-book myths and heroes invented by Lee in the 1960s had a solidity depth and even a literary quality other comic heroes and worlds lacked--which is why we liked them.""Daredevil"" is supposed to be darker and more intense than the other Marvel movies and Daredevil himself more fallible. Hes a mortal like Batman and though his other senses have developed to compensate for his blindness--and though hes also a crack martial artist--he has no mutant or alien superpowers. After every fight he has to feed himself pain-killers to recuperate. That mortality should make the story more interesting but the movie still seems strained--as uncomfortable in its own superhero suit as Affleck often is.Daredevils blindness makes him an unusual hero and the movie has a clever way of showing us the effects of the super-sensory skills hes developed as compensation the way he ""sees"" through ultra-sensitive senses of hearing and touch. And it shows us how Daredevil is ambivalently received by the public and the media with determined New York Post reporter Ben Urich (Joe Pantoliano) dogging his tracks.But despite all that the movie is loud clanging and unimaginative. Johnson is best known for his scripts for the ""Grumpy Old Men"" comedies and for the glossy somewhat sappy ""Simon Birch""--three shallow likable films. Despite his highly charismatic cast this one is even shallower.1 | 2 | Next MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated Articles5 Fun Facts About The HulkJune 20 2003Avengers flexes muscles with 200 mln in US CanadaMay 6 2012The book was so much betterApril 2 2008Find More Stories AboutDaredevilTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter",http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-02-14/entertainment/0302140411_1_daredevil-super-hero-elektra-natchios,200,daredevil28,daredevil,chicagotribune

As the title character whos a blind attorney by day and an avenging superhero by night Ben Affleck leaps wriggles and-mostly-strikes poses wearing whats meant to be a very cool red leather jumpsuit; he looks like Catwoman made over by Revlon. The film keeps insisting that Daredevils soul is in torment but it would be hard to think of a star who seethes with darkness less than Affleck. When this hollow clone of Batman and Spider-Man leaps around like a ninja dodging razory pinwheels were left with the dispiriting sensation that F/X are accomplishing what the hero-and indeed any live actor-could not.

"Daredevil | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; daredevil ) Daredevil (United States 2003) A movie review by James Berardinelli In the Pantheon of Marvel Comics superheroes Daredevil is more of a demi-god than a full-blown deity. Hes a notch below Spider-Man The Fantastic Four The Hulk and The X-Men. 20th Century Fox has acknowledged this when determining Daredevils release date. This particular superhero is debuting in February not in the middle of the summer when competition from The X-Men and The Hulk would greatly diminish his chances of being noticed. Sometimes you can tell when parts of a movie have been left on the cutting room floor and thats the case with Daredevil. The trade-off for a short running length (only 100 minutes) is a herky-jerky narrative that rarely moves smoothly. There are times when important nuggets of information are missing a not because they have been intentionally withheld but because the scene(s) in which they were revealed are not in the final cut. Coherent exposition is not Daredevils strong suit. Cinematically the inspiration for Daredevil is Batman. Hells Kitchen in The Big Apple is a dark and dreary place and although its not as architecturally bizarre as Gotham City there are stone gargoyles and harpies everywhere. Few scenes transpire during the day; nearly all of the action is either indoors or at night. And the title character is a vigilante wearing a mask and a tight leather suit who spends his nights up on the citys rooftops stalking the bad guys. Although Daredevils alter-ego Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck) isnt as rich or suave as Bruce Wayne he certainly has a way with the ladies. We see Daredevils origins via a flashback that absorbs about 15 minutes of the movies first half-hour. After being blinded in an accident with hazardous chemicals Matt (played as a boy by Scott Terra) discovers that his other four senses have been exponentially enhanced. In fact he now has a radar-like sixth sense that allows him to ""see."" (The first time or two the camera allows us to view things from Matts perspective are interesting. After that the approach quickly becomes overused.) Following the death of his father at the hands of a mobster Matt decides to devote his life to bringing criminals to justice a one way or another. As an adult Matt is a lawyer by day vigilante by night. His nocturnal activities have caused him to be a thorn in the side of New Yorks biggest crime lord Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan) who recruits an Irish villain named Bullseye (Colin Farrell) to eliminate Daredevil. Bullseye is a magician with hand-thrown missiles like knives. He never misses a until his first confrontation with Daredevil. Meanwhile Matt enters into a whirlwind relationship with the dangerous and athletic Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner) who also happens to be on Kingpin/Bullseyes target list. Although Matt generally believes in what hes doing he has doubts. Consequently the screenplay has him paying frequent visits to a confessional. He also has lines like ""Can a man make a difference? There are days when I believe that and others when I dont."" Unfortunately all of this angst seems more like window-dressing than genuine motivation. In fact one of the problems with Daredevil is that the main character never attains three-dimensionality. Despite various attempts by writer/director Mark Steven Johnson to flesh him out he remains as flat as an image on a comic book page. As befits a comic book-turned-motion picture there are plenty of action scenes featuring moves that defy logic gravity and the laws of physics. The best of the fights however isnt the duel between Daredevil and Bullseye nor is it the anticlimactic showdown between our hero and Kingpin. Instead its what passes for foreplay between Daredevil and Elektra. Instead of kissing and cuddling like most normal couples they do their best to knock each other on their butts. As hard as he tries Ben Affleck will probably never be better than mediocre as an action hero. Affleck isnt bad as Matt/Daredevil but hes not good either. More impressive is Jennifer Garner who radiates spunk and spirit as Elektra. Michael Clarke Duncan seems to be enjoying himself in the larger-than-life role of the biggest crime boss in the city. And for a change the ubiquitous Colin Ferrell gets to play someone whos bad-to-the-bone. The phrase ""over the top"" doesnt do this performance justice. Fans of the comic book will probably have some nits to pick but overall Daredevil does about one would expect from a movie of that name a present about 90 minutes of disposable action-oriented entertainment. Its not as good as either of its recent Marvel cinematic siblings (Spider-Man and X-Men) in large part because the proceedings lose far too much momentum in the last act and the desire to set up a sequel results in things ending with a whimper. Its an adequate superhero yarn but hopefully its not the best of the burgeoning genre that 2003 has to offer.
