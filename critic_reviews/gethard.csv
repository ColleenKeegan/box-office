Entertainment ""Get Hard"" Is So Eager To Offend That It Misses The Whole Point Hipster racism gay panic and a little sexism too. The Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart movie proves that whats really gotten hard is edgy comedy. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell in Get Hard Warner Bros. ID 5337440 The new comedy Get Hard basically revolves around three extended jokes. The first is racist Hedge fund manager James King (Will Ferrell) assumes that car wash business owner named Darnell Lewis (Kevin Hart) has done time solely because the guys black. The second is about rape threaded through with gay panic James has been sentenced to 10 years in San Quentin and is so certain hell ""become someones bitch"" that he hires the actually squeaky-clean Darnell to toughen him up. The third is that Get Hard is in on the other two jokes fully aware and confident that you know that the movie knows better drawing the racially charged jokes out with a big ol wink -- Arent we so bad? Get Hard is the directorial debut of Etan Cohen a screenwriter whose past credits include Tropic Thunder and Idiocracy and who theoretically knows his boundary-pushing R-rated comedy. But his new film is so eager to offend and pleased with its own provocations that it hardly ever gets around to undermining the racism homophobia and sexism it so gleefully explores. Instead Get Hard which opens in theaters on Mar. 27 is a feature-length exercise in hipster racism joshingly having Ferrell dress up in garish camo and cheetah prints for a trip to Crenshaw and then -- whoops -- having the gang members hes meeting all be drawn from every half-assed racial stereotype available. Its the film equivalent of Sean Penn announcing Alejandro Inarritus Oscar win by asking ""Who gave this son of a bitch his green card?"" and then getting mad that people didnt like the ""inside humor"" with his pal. But Get Hard isnt even worth getting mad about because the most damning thing about the movie is that its never anywhere near as edgy as it believes itself to be its observations about race and class both on the nose and underwritten. ID 5337298 Warner Bros. Warner Bros. ID 5340078 At the start of Get Hard James is living in a Bel Air bubble of blissful 1-percenterdom in a marble-pillared mansion he shares with his grasping fiancee Alissa (Alison Brie who deserves better than playing an evil set of boobs). A dozen miles away Darnell is desperately trying to raise 30000 so that he his wife Rita (Edwina Findley Dickerson) and their daughter Makayla (Ariana Neal) can move to an area with better schools. James is the top earner at a firm founded by his future father-in-law Martin (Craig T. Nelson) and Darnell runs a car wash business in the buildings basement. The duos first scene together begins with James thinking hes being mugged (until Darnell reminds him they know each other) and ends with him delivering a speech that could be lifted directly from the comments section on any article about government benefit programs. ""I didnt get to the place I am today by asking for handouts"" James intones. ""I got here by hard work."" Its possible he did. But Get Hard shows James existence to be one of coddled privilege -- and hes oblivious to the eye-rolling and forced smiles of his house staff and his capoeira instructor. The movie also makes clear that James is still a fundamentally nice ethical guy who gets framed for fraud because hes so trusting. Ferrell plays him as the exact intersection of two of his most popular past roles Ron Burgundy and Buddy the elf bloviating but naive. All of his ignorant assumptions about race are only because he doesnt know any better which frees the movie up to have Darnell instruct him in as he puts it ""every stereotype he already thinks I am."" ID 5339665 View this image > Patti Perret / Warner Bros. ID 5346945 Nothing better encapsulates the films muddled sensibilities than the scene in which Darnell plays three different characters -- one black one Latino and one gay -- in order to show James what a prison yard is like. The laughs feel like they should be at the expense of James but theyre really about how funny the broad caricatures Hart is performing are. And despite Harts frantic charisma theyre not funny -- theyre cartoonish affirmations of all of the assumptions Get Hard is supposedly poking fun at. The movie positions itself as a provocative comedy about race -- starting with the poster art which suggests a scene that never takes place in the movie in which Darnell is giving James cornrows -- but its reality is so lazy even in its attempted button-pushing. As Darnell attempts to help James by introducing him to his gangster cousin Russell (T.I.) for example he takes James in and gives him the nickname ""Mayo."" And Get Hards best laugh even comes from the repurposing of a joke thats been done before in which Darnell borrows the plot of a movie (i.e. Boys in the Hood) to fill in the troubled past he doesnt actually have. James doesnt recognize the story and is rapt but Rita and Makayla side-eye Darnell furiously as he elaborates on his youth with Doughboy and Ricky. Where Get Hard does finally manage to offend is in its treatment of homosexuality wholeheartedly giving in to the gay panic that R-rated bromances finally seemed to be getting over. Again and again Get Hard ties the very real and understandble fear of rape in with a general sense that men having sex with men is hilariously icky. ""Might as well call it San Fuckin"" Darnell says smacking his hands together to create a soundtrack as he describes a scenario in which James gets gang-banged behind bars. Later Darnell takes James to a gay brunch spot with the theory that James might as well get some practice giving head ordering him to pick up a guy (Matt Walsh) and take him into a bathroom stall. The resulting scene stages the attempted blow job as unapologetic gross-out humor complete with a couple quick shots of a flaccid penis. And the movie ends by confirming that its the bad guys thatll end up getting raped in prison throwing in an added tiresome bit based around the potential double meaning of ""get hard."" Its all awful enough that you expect the movie to end with a title card that proclaims ""Dont worry guys -- we have gay friends and black friends. Were cool.""

Entertainment) People who complain that the shambling new Will Ferrell-Kevin Hart comedy ""Get Hard"" is racist and homophobic are just being lazy - although not half as lazy as the movie itself which has brought this fate on itself through its mixed messaging and total incoherence. Yes this is the motion picture in which Ferrells character finds himself on his knees in a West Hollywood mens room seeking to master the fellatio skills that will help him survive in maximum security prison and in which he later tries to join a South L.A. street gang by strapping on a ""burner"" and heading into the streets to ""smoke some fools."" And yes I will maintain that to dismiss ""Get Hard"" as racist or homophobic is missing the point or at least making a categorical error.If those words are to mean anything at all it has to be more than ""likely to give offense to someone"" or ""susceptible to misinterpretation."" Mind you Im offering only the feeblest possible defense for ""Get Hard"" which begins with vague intentions of constructing a crude Dickensian satire on American inequality and squanders about 99 percent of its energy on labored comic sketches that dont pay off. This movies problem is less that it traffics in outrageous stereotypes - effective satire does that almost by definition -- than that its purported reasons for doing so get lost amid a bloated cluttered star vehicle. Youd have to be extraordinarily dense not to see (as the filmmakers have defensively pointed out) that Ferrells clueless and entitled white-boy character is the butt of the joke in the above-mentioned instances and many others but the theoretical why behind those jokes has evaporated entirely.Ferrell plays a hedge-fund zillionaire named James King who has a giant house in Bel Air and a rich-bitch fiancee embodied by Alison Brie in some supposedly sexy underwear. All the actors in ""Get Hard"" are stuck with dreadful non-characters but if you ask me Bries paper-thin misogynist caricature is the most insidious and unexamined stereotype in the whole movie. As for Ferrell hes a powerful and instinctive actor who has great trouble faking enthusiasm and his listless dead-eyed performance as James is more than Method acting. James has been convicted on numerous counts of fraud and is being sent to San Quentin by a hard-ass judge eager to send a lesson. No this isnt remotely plausible - but it might be a good thing right? I mean setting aside the hilarious question of prison rape which generates the ludicrous and increasingly unfunny plot of ""Get Hard"" compelling white-collar offenders to serve time alongside other kinds of criminals could serve as an actual deterrent.Not to go off on a tangent here but this is a good spot for the bizarre subject of prison rape - a subject most of us would agree is inherently not all that funny -- as a central ingredient in guy-oriented comedy. This was pretty much a pandemic during the post-metrosexual pre-gay-marriage era of Judd Apatow Sex Panic and reached its apogee with ""Horrible Bosses"" in the summer of 2011 the movie that features a running argument between Jason Bateman and Jason Sudeikis over which of them will be more ""rape-able"" if their low-grade criminal scheme lands them in prison. That gag worked way too hard to be outrageous like everything else in that film but its exploration of new frontiers in male vanity - the only thing worse than becoming someones prison-house bitch would be not being cute enough -- is funnier and darker more original than anything in ""Get Hard"" whose sexual politics seem borrowed from an abandoned ""SNL"" skit circa 1986.Anyway no - it isnt a good idea to send this particular white-collar criminal to Quentin because hes played by Will Ferrell which means he isnt a criminal at all but a wrongfully convicted and essentially lovable doofus. A doofus who has made millions working at some Madoff-flavored elite investment fund a doofus who begins with the assumption that all black men are criminals and a doofus too dumb and oblivious to perceive that his intended bride is a soulless and conniving gold-digger. You see what I mean about mixed messaging. Its clearly not as damaging to the films satirical intention that Hart plays a middle-class striver who owns his own business rather than the street-hardened thug Ferrell-doofus takes him for. But that too is a failure of narrative nerve that feeds into the overarching buddy-movie logic of ""Get Hard"" Yeah racial and economic injustice what a bummer - but these two American goofballs are just the same under the skin so yay. You Might Also Like ""Racist and homophobic"" in this case has nothing to do with conscious intentions and very little to do with real-world effects. Instead it reflects the fundamentally reactionary nature of Hollywood storytelling which undermines and defeats most attempts at ""content"" or ""meaning."" Actually its worth expanding on that point ""Meaning"" is welcome in Hollywood movies when its figured as individual inspiration and transcendence but must be neutralized or turned upside-down anytime it arrives tinged with larger social critique. Kevin Harts on-screen wife a character so free of characteristics she should be called Nice Middle-Class Black Lady (no fault of the likable Edwina Findley Dickerson) cracks a joke about the corny plot of ""The Blind Side"" in this movie but ""Get Hard"" is a lot closer to that kind of anodyne post-racial uplift than it thinks it is.As the seven-figure executives in those sprawling office suites all over the western half of Los Angeles County would assure us this has nothing to do with politics per se. (After all those people are mostly liberals if we take that term in its contemporary meaning of ""those who stuff Hillary Clinton and Chuck Schumer full of cash."") It has to do with protecting valuable assets like Ferrell and Hart by keeping them light and likable and it has to do with giving the people what they want or at least what the entertainment industry has trained them to expect which comes to the same thing. People dont want an earnest lecture about economic inequality or the incarceration rate among African-American males at the end of a hard workweek; they want fun escapist fantasy which evidently means Will Ferrell on his knees in a toilet stall trying to get a dick in his mouth. So Im willing to believe that first-time director Etan Cohen (previously the co-writer of ""Tropic Thunder"" and Mike Judges ""Idiocracy"") went into this with somewhat benevolent intentions which remain visible here and there Lets make a silly raunchy comedy that allows two hugely popular stars a chance to explore the enduring absurdity of racial misperception or something like that. But Cohen had neither the chops nor the clout to prevent ""Get Hard"" from ending up no doubt through the normal process of producer rewrites focus groups worried agents and weevil infestations as a confused and contradictory mess. More to the point its almost never funny and full of elementary screenwriting blunders I wont bother to list Some scenes should be longer while others (many others) should have been cut and nothing about the plot or the timeline makes any sense. Its like a movie written by an ambitious seventh-grader who has constantly been told how amusing he is and then rewritten by the school principal to make sure it doesnt go too far. Come to think of it the kneejerk critics are right after all This movie is racist and homophobic but thats a minor side effect of its badness not the cause. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size Christopher Orr Mar 27 2015 Culture Its a transformation thats been underway for some time but I think we can now say its official Will Ferrell has gone from being this generations John Belushi to being this generations Dan Aykroyd. I mean this not in terms of talent (though the case could perhaps be made) or even style but rather in terms of the roles toward which hes gravitating.Ferrell 47 is now less likely to play a primal agent of chaos than a clueless middle-aged white man upon whom chaos is unleashed. Out with Buddy the Elf and Frank the Tank and the legendary Ricky Bobby. In with IRS agent Harold Crick (Stranger Than Fiction) forensic accountant Allen Gamble (The Other Guys) and now in Get Hard stock trader James King.Related Story The Lego Movie Further Evidence of Will Ferrells Subversive Genius This latest role is particularly Aykroydesque in that it explicitly recalls Louis Winthorpe III from John Landiss classic 1983 prince-and-pauper comedy Trading Places. Like Louis James is a selfish and pampered money-maker for a financial firm beloved by his bosses and by a gold-digging fiancee who will abandon him when like Louis hes framed for a crime. And like Louis he will ultimately be redeemed through the help of his black co-star with Kevin Hart sliding into the Eddie Murphy role.Get Hard alas is no Trading Places. Though it shares the critique of wealthy privilege and racial stereotyping that undergirded Landiss groundbreaker this is a broader duller and more haphazard movie one in which the gags--some funny some not--drive the story rather than the other way around.The central joke of the film is that faced with 30 days to prepare for a ten-year sentence in San Quentin (because thats what happens to white-collar criminals) James commits to ""getting hard"" enough to survive behind bars. The person he chooses to give him a correctional tutorial is car-wash man Darnell Lewis (Hart) whom he assumes on the basis of race must have done time at one time or another. In fact Darnell is a working-class striver and small-business owner whos never gotten so much as a parking ticket. But because he needs 30000 for a down payment on a house in a safer neighborhood for his family (a nice moment finds him on the phone with a mortgage company ""Arent you supposed to be a predatory lender? Prey on me"") Darnell pretends to be the tough black con that James is looking for. ""You dont have to be a thug to portray a thug"" he explains to his skeptical wife.From this premise the movie (directed by Etan Cohen from a script he co-wrote with Jay Martel and Ian Roberts) unfolds as a series of uneven set pieces Darnell tries to make James physically tough; he tries to make him proficient at man-on-man sex (more on this in a moment); he tries to get him hooked up with a racist white prison gang; he tries to get him hooked up with an amiably murderous black prison gang; and so on.This comedy of tumescence is merely the mildest variation of the movies parade of man-on-man sex jokes. The film has its share of funny bits and both stars are well within their comic comfort zones. But many of the wealth-related jokes feel flat and dated (James attended boarding school with ""the Murdochs and the bin Ladens""; when shocked he exclaims ""for the love of Greenspan"") and the gags involving the black gang indulge in precisely the  stereotypes that the movie theoretically seeks to undermine. And there is of course the grammar-school double entendre of the movies title. ""You made me hard so hard"" James tells Darnell appreciatively at one point. ""You got me so hard. There was a moment when I stopped being hard but then I thought of you and I got hard again."" Get it?This exquisite comedy of tumescence is merely the mildest variation of the movies endless--endless--parade of gay sex jokes. (Because prison.) The gags arent edgy or clever and over time they lose the capacity even to offend. What they are is lazy and tedious and ultimately more than touch embarrassing return trip after return trip to a well that was dry to begin with.So what does Get Hard tell us about Will Ferrells career? Certainly nothing good and perhaps nothing at all. Hes at an age by which most comic actors have begun testing themselves experimenting with other forms of comedy and in many cases drama. But with a handful of exceptions (Stranger Than Fiction Everything Must Go Casa de Mi Padre and his villainous voice work in Megamind and The Lego Movie) Ferrell has stuck to the formulaic farce that made him a star even as his roles have been shifting from antic instigator to bewildered straight man. At just the time we might have hoped hed find new ways to get harder Ferrell seems instead to have gone soft.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

At the end of 2013 in the low-slung industrial Taiwanese city of Kaohsiung a bevy of officials came to attend the ribbon cutting of a huge former hotel that had undergone a top-to-bottom multimillion-dollar renovation. Speaking before the throngs of celebrants who blocked the flow of traffic Taiwans deputy director of the Ministry of the Interior praised the group that funded the renovation and presented them for the 10th year straight with the national ""Excellent Religious Group"" award.

Graham A federal appeals court finds the impact of the states voting law can only be explained by ""discriminatory intent."" Updated on July 29 at 930 p.m. DURHAM N.C.--The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down key portions of North Carolinas strict 2013 voting law on Friday delivering a stern rebuke to the states Republican General Assembly and Governor Pat McCrory. The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting. ""In what comes as close to a smoking gun as we are likely to see in modern times the States very justification for a challenged statute hinges explicitly on race--specifically its concern that African Americans who had overwhelmingly voted for Democrats had too much access to the franchise"" wrote Judge Diana Gribbon Motz. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Yes yes yes. Chelsea Clinton is not the most charismatic orator--as the Twittersphere was happy to point out during her brief address on Thursday night. She is like her mother that way. Theres something not quite natural about her self-presentation. Shes not stilted exactly. But she can come across as too cautious too reserved too conscious of other peoples eyes upon her. But lets face it as the lead-in to Hillarys big nominating speech a little bit of boring was called for. Unlike some of this conventions high-wattage speakers there was zero chance Chelsea was going to upstage Hillary with a barnburner or tear-jerker. Chelsea wasnt there to pump up the crowd. Her role was to comfort to explain to cajole with an eye toward giving Americans a glimpse of her mothers softer side. Continue Reading Mike Segar / Reuters The Most Inspiring and Depressing Moment of the Democratic Convention Uri Friedman The father of a Muslim American who died in Iraq confronts Donald Trump. Khizr Khan began his speech at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday with words I wish he didnt have to say ""Tonight we are honored to stand here as parents of Captain Humayun Khan and as patriotic American Muslims--as patriotic American Muslims with undivided loyalty to our country."" I wish he and his wife didnt have to stand there as the parents of a 27-year-old Army captain who was killed by suicide bombers while serving in the Iraq War. And I wish Khizr Khan hadnt felt the need to declare his patriotism and loyalty to the United States of America. Those truths should have been self-evident. The state of the union is not strong when an American feels compelled to clarify such things. In better times Khizr Khan who was born in Pakistan and moved to America from the United Arab Emirates might have begun his speech with what he said next ""Like many immigrants we came to this country empty-handed. We believed in American democracy--that with hard work and [the] goodness of this country we could share in and contribute to its blessings.""

A sex offender is thrown in the stocks presented with a small child and asked if he wants to molest him. A mob of protestors is thrown a ""dummy full of guts"" that is stomped to pieces within seconds. A radio host insists that pedophiles have ""more genes in common with crabs"" than the rest of humanity insisting ""Theres no real evidence for [that] but it is scientific fact."" Its hard to pinpoint the most cringe-inducing moment on ""Paedogeddon"" a special episode of the British TV satire Brass Eye. But 15 years after the episode aired it remains a totemic terrifying satirical vision. Few comedies since have dared to cross the boundaries of taste with such impunity. ""Paedogeddon"" aired in the U.K. in the summer of 2001 a year after the murder of a young girl had sparked national hysteria over the countrys sex-offender registry. Britains most-read newspaper led a campaign to publish the names and locations of all 110000 convicted sex offenders prompting a riot in which an angry mob ransacked the home of an ex-con. Brass Eye a parody of a 60 Minutes-like newsmagazine show had been dormant after airing one season in the UK in 1997. But it returned four years later for this surprise broadcast one that saw its furious (fictional) anchors barking from a dark studio about the plague of seemingly super-powered child molesters stalking the nation holding a funhouse mirror up to the climate of paranoia and fear that had built up around the country. It was a bold wildly insensitive piece of comedy but one that captured the growing madness of the 24-hour news media and foreshadowed some uglier aspects of its future. Continue Reading Charles Mostoller / Reuters Can Personality Be Changed? Scott Barry Kaufman Psychologists have long debated how flexible someones ""true"" self is. Almost everyone has something they want to change about their personality. In 2014 a study that traced peoples goals for personality change found that the vast majority of its subjects wanted to be more extraverted agreeable emotionally stable and open to new experiences. A whopping 97 percent said they wished they were more conscientious. These desires appeared to be rooted in dissatisfaction. People wanted to become more extraverted if they werent happy with their sex lives hobbies or friendships. They wanted to become more conscientious if they were displeased with their finances or schoolwork. The findings reflect the social psychologist Roy Baumeisters notion of ""crystallization of discontent"" Once people begin to recognize larger patterns of shortcomings in their lives he contends they may reshuffle their core values and priorities to justify improving things.

"Get Hard | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; get-hard ) Get Hard (United States 2015) March 27 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli Get Hard is a Will Ferrell movie that comes with all the strengths and weaknesses implied by the designation. Although the marketing campaign plays up the Ferrell/Kevin Hart ""buddy"" angle the film skews more toward Ferrells hit-and-miss brand of comedy than Harts raucous high energy niche. Thats not to say that Hart fails to make his mark but Get Hard feels like a close cousin to Anchorman. Although Ferrells name doesnt appear in the WGA-approved screenplay credit his fingerprints are all over the production. Whether thats good or bad depends on your opinion of the former SNL regular. Get Hard pours Ferrell into a character mold with which we have become familiar. Stockbroker James King a naive awkward man-child is unaware of how contemptuously others view him. In his mind hes the hero of his story. Much of the humor germinates from the conflict between James rose-colored worldview and the pragmatic perspectives of everyone else. The comedy is uneven - some of the bits are hilarious others mistake extreme vulgarity for the path to uncontrollable laughter and more than a few strain a joke beyond the point when its funny. Theres nothing new in Get Hard - this is a staple of Ferrells oeuvre and theres little reason to assume it would change for this outing. James is working in the lap of Wall Street wheeling and dealing like a pro but never breaking the law. Hes making so much for his boss (Craig T. Nelson) that hes looking at the likelihood of a partnership. Plus to sweeten things hes engaged to the bosss impossibly hot materialistic daughter Alissa (Alison Brie). James fairy tale world comes crashing down when the Feds rush in and cuff him during his engagement party. Soon after being convicted of various securities-related felonies hes looking at 10 years in San Quentin. The judge gives him 30 days to get his affairs in order. Thats when he hires car wash entrepreneur Darnell (Hart) to provide him with ""lessons"" about how to survive in prison without being victimized. James is of the mistaken impression that because Darnell is black hes a veteran of doing ""hard time."" Darnell doesnt disabuse him of this notion because he needs 30000 to relocate his family so his daughter can go to a school where she wont have to pass through metal detectors at the front door. Get Hard gains some mileage from anti-stereotype humor (for example gangbangers talking about stock profiles) and satirizing easy targets (white supremacists). One running gag is that James has trouble getting the hang of profane insults but this grows tiresome after a few incidents. Theres also an unfunny bit about a sex act (compete with a prosthetic) that goes on for far too long. At one time comedy along these lines would have been considered risky but with the shock value neutered through repetition in other films its tiresome. (Another recent film Unfinished Business did something similar with equally flaccid results.) Kevin Harts presence adds an element of much-needed energy to a movie that too often plays by the numbers but Hart isnt given enough screen time or leeway to jolt the production. The films best scenes are those in which Darnell ""trains"" James. The buddy element is adequately developed but theres nothing special or memorable in this odd coupling. And Get Hard really bogs down when it strays into the quasi-thriller territory of investigating the frame-up that led to James prison sentence. One doesnt anticipate masterpiece level comedy from a movie with a double entendre-laden title like Get Hard so to a certain extent it can be said to meet expectations. This is a mildly diverting 100 minutes for fans of Will Ferrells brand of humor. The actor has done better work in both dramatic and comedic roles but this shtick appeals to a sizeable piece of his fan base. Dumb juvenile comedy has its place when its funny. Unfortunately too often in Get Hard its not. Get Hard (United States 2015) Director Etan Cohen Cast Will Ferrell Craig T.

The R-rated comedy pairing Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart was derided for being insensitive to African-Americans and to gays -- and finally just not being very funny. I went loaded for bear and instead found a sorry wriggly worm of a thing. Sure it trucks in stereotypes (black white Latino female -- the list is long) and plays clumsily with sexuality. Still the movies greatest and altogether familiar sin is that its stupid. Actually call it ""lazy stupid"" -- when writers we want better from give us their very least. In so doing they call into question their stars own intentions. When white-collar criminal James King (Ferrell) is convicted of fraud and embezzlement he hires a hard-working black businessman he assumes is an ex-con to prep him for life in San Quentin. And just like that prison rape becomes the comedys tiresome obsession its nonstop gag. Before his conviction James is master of his Bel Air universe. Hes set to wed Allisa (Alison Brie). Hes named partner by Allisas dad (Craig T. Nelson). Then hes nailed. He insists on his innocence. ""Get Hard"" was written by Jay Martel and Ian Roberts along with director Etan Cohen. Cohen co-wrote ""Tropic Thunder"" which famously features Robert Downey Jr.s actor character choosing to do his role in blackface. Roberts and Martel write for Comedy Centrals ""Key and Peele"" show. ""Some of our best shows are black"" they might bleat. ""Get Hard"" feels like the work of fellas too certain theyre free from the bigotry of the masses the yahoos the rest of us -- definitely of the white supremacists James and Darnell have a run-in with. Variety reported that when asked during a prickly SXSW Qamp;A if the film perpetuated stereotypes Cohen said ""When you do satire thats a big problem.Thats a dangerous thing. Its a very small window -- thats what were trying to find."" They didnt. Ferrell has his funny bits. His physical derring-do is not quite as desperate as Jim Carreys once seemed but it is utterly mad. The knife-in-the-skull bit is funny. So too the ""sad dog"" riff. Both can be seen in the trailer if you want the laughs. Hart proves likable as the smart one. Family man Darnell is rather sweet. And Hart proves his physical genius in a bit (iffy to be sure) that finds him playing three different types of inmates in a bit of big-house role-playing. A joke about John Singletons 1991 drama ""Boyz n the Hood"" is much funnier than Darnells visits to cousin Russells South-central crib. Rapper producer entrepreneur Tip ""T.I."" Harris portrays the gang leader who actually does know a thing or two about prison. There is nothing like a failed comedy to make for a joyless review. For that I am sorry. As for the film being homophobic the writers violation is three-fold. First they hang their comedy on ""prison rape."" Then in a scene that finds Darnell and James at a L.A. restaurant that has a gay male clientele they conflate rape with sexuality. That ignores one of feminisms vital insights about sexual assault that holds for rape period Its about power. NBCs ""Law amp; Order Special Victims Unit "" -- which has a more legitimate reason to bandy about the ""prison rape"" threat -- went from tiresome to problematic with its use of that anxiety around seven seasons back. Its now in Season 16. And finally Ferrells oral-sex shtick is as crude as it is overlong. The two characters unsullied by the movies misfires are Darnells wife Rita (Edwina Findley) and daughter Makayla (Ariana Neal). Darnell goes with James offensive assumption and takes the job of Professor Higgins to James Know-little to get his youngster into a better school. Make no mistake Neither of these bright females would waste her time on this flagrant folly. Correction Due to an editing error this review originally misspelled the name of screenwriter Etan Cohen.

"When Orange Calls for Black The Racial and Sexual Impotence of Get Hard. Plus Al Pacino Is Great Again << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com When Orange Calls for Black The Racial and Sexual Impotence of Get Hard. Plus Al Pacino Is Great Again Warner Bros. Movies March 27 2015 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print The first 15 minutes of Get Hard set the stage for a nutty social farce like Trading Places. Will Ferrell plays James King a senior hedge fund manager with a Los Angeles palace and a sexy young fiancee. Kevin Hart is Darnell the guy who runs the parking garage beneath Jamess office building. One afternoon Darnell taps on Jamess car window to get his attention and give him the keys and James lets out a long frightened scream. He doesnt bother to turn around to see who it is. He doesnt have to. The movie has so perfectly set up Jamess affluent white aloofness that its clear that the mere prospect of contact with a nonwhite person (Darnell is black) would terrify him. In the same scene Darnell asks James to consider buying a lifetime platinum membership to the struggling car wash Darnell operates. It costs 30000. James demurs. Instead he gives Darnell a lecture about investing. In a matter of years James could turn that money into 3 million. Moreover unlike Darnell he didnt ask for handouts to get where he is. (He simply accepted them from his father but never mind.) The point is Why doesnt Darnell work harder to get where he wants to go? An exchange like this is such a classic talking (down) point between the classes (and by extension between races) that the movie can afford to keep its barely straight face. Were getting the joke. It helps that the person visible in Ferrells caricature suggests a refurbished device whose original software was unsuccessfully wiped. Only loosely is James an asshole. So when the big dogs at his firm -- including his future father-in-law played by Craig T. Nelson and Greg Germann as house counsel -- frame him for fraud and embezzlement you feel for him. And the movie taps into the publics outrage over economic inequality. With all of Ferrells sponge-haired oafish ersatz innocence James insists that he intends to fight the charges against him. But at trial the judge throws the book at him 10 years at San Quentin. Its meant to be a message to the whole financial world. Indeed victims bilked by Jamess firm show up after the trial and bang on his Town Car. The sentence includes a month to prepare for prison. The movie strikes a cathartic balance between absurdity and some kind of injustice. In a montage you see Ferrell in a 1 percenters despair. One very funny shot has him weeping trying to drink a glass of red while vibrating in a recliner. His accounts are frozen. His sexy fiancee (Alison Brie pampered but sharp) leaves him. He puts on a wig and mustache and tries to flee. These scenes are all so well done so tasting of ill-gotten upper-crustiness that you want to know where the rest of this movie is going. But if youre at Get Hard you probably already know racial-stereotype reinforcement. Darnell finds James stuffed in the trunk of a car in the office garage (James was on the run). James explains his situation. Darnell already knows. James presumes Darnell can relate because Darnell is black and is working this menial job and according to James one in three black American men goes to prison. So statistically speaking isnt Darnell likely to be an ex-con? Darnell takes umbrage in that catching-the-Holy Spirit way that is Harts specialty. He summons for James a fulminating pantomime of the endless sex that awaits James behind bars. James offers Darnell 30000 for a crash course in how to avoid it. Even with that ridiculous premise declared youre intrigued. In the next scene were at Darnells for the first time where his wife Rita (Edwina Findley Dickerson as good as Brie but with a lot less to do) is expressing disbelief about Darnells plan. ""What do you know about prison?"" she asks. Attempting to act tough he calls her a bitch and she hauls off and smacks him. But as the movie proceeds the intrigue dissipates. Darnell calls a cousin for tips and tells James the plot of Boyz n the Hood as if it were the story of his life. The prison school Darnell concocts turns Jamess mansion into a makeshift maximum-security facility built by Jamess Latin staff played by some funny actors who are only barely allowed in on the jokes. One of the houses studies becomes Jamess cell. One of the tennis courts turns into a prison yard. The school stuff is loaded with dismaying coursework featuring scores of rape jokes and culminating in a prison-yard scenario in which Ferrell is bombarded by Harts impersonations of three inmate archetypes gangsta cholo fairy. Get Hard turns out to be a far cry from something like Trading Places or even the clever first half of the class-insurrection comedy of Tower Heist. Its freewheeling street-approved tourism is closer to the white-dude-in-the-hood flagrancy of Jamie Kennedy as a ""wanksta"" in Malibus Most Wanted which is a slightly more tolerable piece of racial cynicism. Trading Places is the kind of white-liberal fantasy that brought us Diffrent Strokes and Webster but it also had a fizzy distrusting intelligence that Get Hard lacks. The problem with this movie is that you keep waiting for it to turn the premise and its presumptions upside down but it never gets even part of the way there. The writing doesnt think much of Darnell. Compared with James he has no talent or skill. (Hes not even a good impostor ex-convict.) We learn about Jamess educational background and peers; its for laughs but its still information that tells you who this guy is. Despite his being framed and convicted James has a way with math and money. We see him apply it. What ultimately is Darnell good at? Ferrell and Hart share this movie but the writing for them is hardly equal. I dont know what Hart is supposed to be playing. Hes just the industrys idea of A Black Person. Just about all the nonwhite workers we see work for James. Darnells wife Rita is a nurse but the only time we hear about her work is after James gets himself a gross boo-boo. The movie is actually presenting Darnell as the ambitionless peon James presumes him to be. By the time he takes James to see his ex-con gangsta cousin Russell (T.I.) for a possible ride-along drive-by Darnell seems smart only compared to the dummies in Russells crew. The one crime-free black male has to pretend to be bad to prevent a good white guy from having worse things happen to him -- and all for our entertainment. More might be demanded of this movie if Jamie Foxx were playing James. But that movie would never get made. The script is credited to the movies director Etan Cohen as well as to Jay Martel and Ian Roberts both of whom are the executive producers for Comedy Centrals absurdist racial kaleidoscope of a sketch show Key amp; Peele. (All of whom are white.) The smart class-warfare setup erodes into another helping of sexually paranoid bromance one chafed by the quills of race and typical of Ferrells lack of intra-male boundaries. Most of Darnells personal training involves Jamess being readied to defend against assault. He dispatches James to fight strangers as some people might break in a pit bull. He lets James use him as a barbell to do bench presses. But he also takes James to solicit blow jobs at ""L.A.s flirtiest gay brunch."" While James is in a bathroom stall falling into a strangers crotch Darnell is back in the garden getting picked up by a guy (T.J. Jagodowski) who wont take no for an answer. The scene manages split-level comedy -- its both homophobic and homo-curious in a way thats disorienting yet fascinating. Hart isnt playing contempt at that gay brunch. Hes insulted because the guy isnt as good-looking as Darnell believes himself to be. But his exasperation vaguely pays off four or five scenes later in a tacked-on moment that reminds you once again that Hart can be a breathtakingly tender star. When James embraces Darnell and tells him he got hard thinking about him youre surprised the double entendre doesnt make Hart recoil. Ferrell says it over and over and every time little Hart gets a bit more lost in Ferrells big embrace. It all points toward an inauthentic but perversely warm half-step forward for so-called bromance an advance that makes you wonder whether the movies will figure out as the country as a whole currently is how to be comfortable about homosexuality before achieving comfort with race. This movie opens the same week that HBO announced that it wont renew Looking its slow-burning romantic comedy about the lives of actual gay men. The ratings were poor. But when youre seeing Ferrell and Hart feeling on each other and all but falling in love the impending absence of that show -- and its reality -- stings. Get Hard knows how to screw around. But when it comes to anything more it lacks the balls to fuck.  Danny Collins Productions Theres a kind of modest American comedy thats so keenly done that you dont bother resisting. All the details feel exactly right for that particular story and those characters. It just works. Right away you can tell that Danny Collins is working. The editing and camerawork establish an easy storytelling rhythm. Theres wit in the writing. The actors are alert and into their roles. Theres not a lot going on and that turns out to be to its advantage. It keeps surprising you. In the opening sequence a pop singer named Danny Collins (Al Pacino) whos been very famous for four decades has just finished punching the air at another ecstatically sold-out show. As he barely sings his biggest hit he sways his old bones back and forth like a Margaritaville Jolly Roger. A quick cut backstage catches him looking cadaverous. Hes drunk coked up and girdled into his black pants and matching open shirt. Revelers cavort in his dressing room but not with him. Oh no I thought here comes one of those bottoming-out musical dramas. But then Dannys forever-manager (Christopher Plummer) gives him an early birthday present a framed handwritten letter that John Lennon wrote to him in the early 1970s that Danny never received. (The movie takes the premise from a similar letter that Lennon actually did write to a young British folksinger named Steve Tilston.) Danny is floored. It gets him thinking about what might have been. It makes him feel a bit like a fraud. He catches his latest wife cheating on him in the master bedroom of his gated Los Angeles fortress and decides to cancel his lucrative tour and head to New Jersey. The plan is to reintroduce himself to a grown son Tom (Bobby Cannavale) who really really doesnt want to see Danny. He makes his base of operations a Hilton in someplace called Woodcliff Lake where he passes out compliments to the dazzled staff. ""Great face"" he exclaims to Nicky the young valet (Josh Peck). With the hotel manager Mary Sinclair (Annette Bening) Danny commits to a regimen of high-intensity flattery. He makes Pepe Le Pew look like Bartleby the Scrivener. ""While youre checking me in"" he says ""Ill be checking you out."" He lays it on thick. She scrapes it off. On both the romantic and paternal fronts Dannys got his work cut out for him. Musically too. Its been 30 years since he last wrote a new song but he cant sing the old ones anymore. That big hit is something called ""Hey Baby Doll"" and the chorus is a lawsuit away from ""Sweet Caroline"" -- Splenda to Neil Diamonds sugar. To attempt to change that Danny ships a giant Steinway to his hotel suite and gets to work on what turns out to be a pretty good mood-color ballad (composed in fact by Ryan Adams). I love that Danny knows who he is. He doesnt quit abusing substances. He just cuts cocaine out of his life the way some people do carbs. He likes being a famous rock star. He loves the clothes especially the shirts he can open to the middle of his chest so that you can see the crucifix he keeps on a necklace. Even when hes sitting in the hotel bar after another tough day with Tom looking sunk hes unsinkable. Mary walks into the bar to ask him how she should handle a drunken celebrity and ends up spending the night drinking and commiserating alongside him. Who wouldnt? Danny Collins is the sort of thing that 25 or 30 years ago wouldve come out every week a low-budget low-stakes excuse for good actors to have some fun with a smart director and script (by Dan Fogelman who wrote the busy AARP-centric comedy Last Vegas). Now its such a rarity -- Pacino and Bening just relaxing together charming each other being legitimately funny but also versions of themselves -- that the sheer entertainment of it brings a tear to your eyes. Fogelman gives most of the scenes a huge emotional brightness. Theres a shot at Dannys surprise party that pans across a line of aged former showbiz guys staring agog at some nubile woman. The camera keeps going until it finds Danny in a doorway doing the same thing. The movie is full of little wonderful touches like that including the very last shot. All of the actors are good even Jennifer Garner as Samantha Toms pregnant semi-tough wife. She doesnt go for too much which is perfect since she doesnt need to. Neither does Plummer who gets snobbily bent out of shape by all of this New Jersey business. Tom and Samantha have a focus-challenged kid named Hope whos played by Giselle Eisenberg a child actor but a miracle of one; shes got comic timing makes funny faces and has real chemistry with Pacino. But everybody here has that especially Bening who somehow finds a way to give the same clenched smile about 20 different meanings. Its exciting to see a brilliant actor invent a character by thinking about what that woman does for work. Bening gets to reinvent customer service as a sterling personality trait. You get why she lowers her guard for this leathered mildly obnoxious man too Pacinos really enjoying himself. Danny is miserable but you can sense immediately that Pacino isnt playing misery. The bottom that Danny has hit is spiritual. He needs to detox his soul. Pacino makes his way through this movie granting wishes and tossing out treats like a combination used-car salesman and leprechaun. Its been years since hes been this relaxed in a movie. You dont care that he cant make rock megastardom seem possible. Pacino makes himself seem plausible as a movie star again. Forget Oscars. That deserves a toss of your underwear. This post has been updated to correct two errors The platinum membership offered to Ferrells character was a lifetime one not an annual one and Ferrells response about the money hed have otherwise refers to a sum of 3 million not 30 million.

Photo Warner Bros. Pictures The new Will Ferrell-Kevin Hart comedyA Get HardA is designed to provoke you and maybe even piss you off a little. Does it cross the line into actual racism and/or homophobia as some contend? Maybe. Probably. Everybodys threshold for offense is different and the movie flaunts its ""edge"" like its going out of style. But the real problem is thatA Get Hards very idea of edge is itself pretty stale. It feels like a bunch of off-color jokes the filmmakers have been trying to tell for years and theyve crammed them all into one film -- with tiresome results. The setup is simple and symmetrical James King (Ferrell) a soft smug finance-industry hotshot is arrested for fraud and embezzlement on the eve of his engagement party -- right in the middle of a private concert by John Mayer. (The very game Mayer is hilarious in his cameo and when John Mayer is the best thing in your movie you worry.) On the other edge of town Darnell Lewis (Hart) the fast-talking and hardworking owner of a small luxury-car-cleaning service is desperately trying to get a mortgage to buy a home in a better neighborhood so his young daughter doesnt have to go to a shitty and dangerous school where every morning the kids glumly line up to get jammed through a metal detector. Darnell needs 30000 for the down payment on the home but nobody will give him a loan. (""Arent you supposed to be a predatory lender? Prey on me Youre a lion Im a gazelle"" he pleads to the bank.) When James (whom we know is probably innocent) becomes the spiritual fall guy for all of the financial industrys misdeeds and gets ten years in maximum-security prison he goes to Darnell for lessons on how to survive doing hard time. Darnell knows nothing about prison and is offended that James would even think he does -- but the rich man offers him the 30000 he needs for that mortgage so away we go. The juxtaposition between the two characters is initially telling and poignant While Darnell is trying to get away from his tough surroundings Jamess life is filled with faux manifestations of strength and machismo He has capoeira class every day with everyone indulging his ego; he stretches his pasty doughy naked body at the window every morning while his poor gardener works right outside; his gold-digging fiancee (Alison Brie) pretends to love his manliness and talks dirty to him; ""Were on a boat bitch"" reads a T-shirt from one of his company retreats. Darnell meanwhile seeks the soft comfort of his tough take-no-prisoners wife Rita played by a terrific Edwina Findley Dickerson. He works like a dog and makes next to nothing while James makes millions with one trade over the phone and then pats himself on the back for all his hard labor. At first you wonder if maybe Get Hard is going in a Trading Places direction -- not so much because these two characters with very different lives might switch but because of the fun the film has playing them off one another. The two leads complement each other nicely too. Farrell has his typical overgrown bumbling Foghorn Leghorn-like beefiness and Hart brings a spark-plug Speedy Gonzalez charisma; I wouldnt mind seeing them reunite for a better film. Alas Get Hard eventually becomes just one big prison-rape joke repeated ad nauseam in every conceivable permutation. While Darnell attempts to teach James how to act (and be) tough its all at the service of keeping him from becoming someones ""bitch"" -- not exactly fresh comic ground. The film does cross the line when convinced he cant teach James to protect himself Darnell gives up and takes him to a gay bar so he can ""learn to suck dick."" Obviously the conflation of homosexuality with prison rape is downright psychotic and partly positing this as a sign of Darnells own cluelessness doesnt help matters much. Similarly the fact that Darnell and his family seem to be the only black characters in this world who arent criminals is discomfiting. Its not that the film needs to sprinkle in some token characters but when the films worldview actually seems to confirm Jamess deranged assumption that all black people must know a lot about crime and prison thats a problem. But offense can be a valuable comic tool. From Blazing Saddles to Freddy Got Fingered to Borat to Bad Santa plenty of films have found real laughs by crossing uncrossable lines. Get Hard wants to be one of those films and it comes from people who understand that genre of comedy -- two of the writers Jay Martel and Ian Roberts are Key amp; Peele veterans and director and co-writer Etan Cohen co-wrote Tropic Thunder and Idiocracy. But Get Hard isnt one of those films because it has no real spirit of comic invention; it offends us but it doesnt do it to get unexpected uncomfortable laughs. Theyre the same dumb jokes youve heard a million times before gussied up in the guise of social commentary. The cringe is not worth the chuckle in this case.A A A Tagswill ferrellkevin hartget hardmoviesreviewsmovie reviewMore Share on Facebook Tweet this Story Top Stories 11 Episodes of PokA(c)mon on Netflix That Help Explain PokA(c)mon Goas Grip on Society Remembering Garry Marshall TVas Mr. Nice Guy You Havenat Seen Everything John Cho Can Do Most Viewed Stories Constance Wu Slams Matt Damonas Great Wall Film for Perpetuating a aRacist Mytha 17.5k Shares Share Tweet LeBron James Reportedly Stopped Justin Bieber From Performing at the RNC 79 Shares Share Tweet John C.

So ""Get Hard"" which is more a series of sketches reacting to a situation than an actual movie has plenty of funny moments. How could it not? Theres a physical dissonance between these two -- black/white tall/short -- that has served comedy teams since Laurel and Hardy and Abbot and Costello roamed the earth. Beyond that Ferrells man-baby persona (the movie begins with him bawling like an infant) works nicely with Harts firecracker explosiveness.But ... a word about homophobia. ""Get Hard"" -- which is overstuffed with too-obvious erectile jokes -- has a serious case of it. Which you might think would get buried in the general raunch of things but it doesnt. Instead it stands out and the more everything gay is ridiculed as horrifying the less funny it becomes. Somebody here doth protest too much and ultimately the gay jokes are a drag on the film.Ferrell plays James King a financial wizard whos just been made partner at his firm and is set to marry the spoiled daughter (Alison Brie) of his boss (Craig T. Nelson). Hart is Darnell owner of a car wash enterprise in the bottom of Kings building whose great ambition is to move his wife (Edwina Findley Dickerson) and daughter (Ariana Neal) to a better neighborhood.But early on FBI agents raid James engagement party and take him away for financial shenanigans. James says hes innocent but after turning down a plea bargain a judge sentences him to 10 years hard time in a maximum security prison. James -- whos used to an elite country club life -- has to toughen up.So he turns to the only black person he knows Darnell for guidance wrongly assuming that because Darnell is black hes been to prison. Darnell sees an opportunity to earn the money for a down payment on a new house. So knowing nothing first-hand about prison he takes the job.Which sets up the prison boot camp sequences that make up most of the movie. Darnell turns James mansion into a faux jail with the servants enlisted as guards. He tries to teach James how to make a mad dog face he forces him to pick fights with strangers (James always loses) and he tries to force him to have sex with men so hell be er open to such inevitable encounters in prison.Along the way James attempts to join a Nazi biker gang for protection inside; when that doesnt work James tries to blend in with a black gang run by Darnells cousin (T.I.). James nickname? Mayo.The films best bit involves Darnell confronting James on a pretend jail yard first as a black thug then as a Latino homeboy then as an amorous inmate. Hart bounces back and forth between characters as James tries to reason with each one individually. Its a marvel of timing that makes you wish that much work and thought had gone into the entire film.But alas thats not the case. ""Get Hard"" is another goofy raunchy silly movie of the sort Ferrell regularly makes energized by Harts presence and undercut by its own juvenile homophobic obsessions. Will you laugh? Absolutely. Could this have been a better film? Definitely.tlongdetroitnews.comtwitter.com/toomuchTomLongGet HardGRADE B-Rated R for pervasive crude and sexual content and language some graphic nudity and drug materialRunning time 100 minutes 149 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 4 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1Cgvfty MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2015/03/27/long-get-hard/70502300/,200,gethard8,gethard,detroitnews

Photo Patti Perret MOVIE REVIEW Get Hard Running time 99 minutes. Rated R (profanity crude humor nudity). If the jokes in ""Get Hard"" were a set of Jeopardy categories theyd read as follows Things Will Ferrell Puts Up His Butt Butt Rape Shots of Will Ferrells Bare Butt and Satirical Comparisons of Violent and Nonviolent Crime Not Excluding Mentions of Balzac. Ferrell plays a racist financial tycoon headed to prison who asks for help dealing with life inside from the only black guy (Kevin Hart) he knows. The blundering satire (Wall Street is ""gangsta"" say some thugs in Crenshaw who nearly come to blows arguing about IRAs) is as dull and predictable as the references to being made somebodys ""bitch."" If Balzac (mentioned by Ferrells Harvard-educated character) were reviewing this shambles of a movie hed point to Ferrell and Harts eight-figure salaries and say ""See? I told you behind every great fortune lies a great crime."" Directed by Etan Cohen who also co-wrote the script the movie is a lazy attempt to drag out a Funny or Die-style skit to feature length by continuously recycling about eight minutes worth of gags. Photo Patti PerretUnlike ""Trading Places"" in which the scam was so elaborate and clever that Wall Streeters loved the movie ""Get Hard"" doesnt bother to work out the details of how arrogant investor James (Ferrell) gets railroaded and sent to prison by his boss (Craig T. Nelson) who is also the father of his gold-digging fiancee (Alison Brie). When James thinks about it it takes him a few seconds to figure out what happened (a forged paper trail of fraud). Then with everything on the line he inexplicably turns from a cringing number-cruncher into an ass-kicking superhero. But in the meantime he turns to Darnell (Hart) -- the guy who washes his car -- for prison-survival tips not suspecting that Darnell has never even gotten a parking ticket. Darnell figures hell fake it and pocket 30000 which he needs to move his family out of South Central. Photo Patti PerretThe movie might have worked if Darnell (played by say Ice Cube) had really been a tough guy and the two characters learned something from each other but as it is its just a series of dead-end sketches. Darnell orders James to pick fights with bodybuilders. Darnell redesigns James Bel Air mansion as an imitation prison camp. Darnell has James walk into a neo-Nazi biker bar to cut a deal with a white-supremacist prison gang into Crenshaw to make a deal with black gangbangers and into a gay brunch spot to learn how to perform oral sex. The characters dont change or learn anything from each other; ""Get Hard"" is just one silly trailer moment after another -- look Hart has a flamethrower Hey Ferrell is bench-pressing Hart Nor does it fail to remind us (in the closing minutes) that the title is a double entendre of the kind we all enjoyed in seventh grade. When in doubt Cohen gives us a shot of Ferrells naked heinie or chatter about man-on-man action behind bars or a look at the many kinds of shivs James says he stores in his rectum. Only once in a while is anything surprising enough to be funny such as when Cohen (who went to Harvard) dishes out one of the best jokes about Yale Ive heard. Its embarrassing to those of us schooled in New Haven to learn from this movie that Harvard apparently has something we were never offered a Ph.D. program in buttockology.

"Get Hard amuses while offending review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesGet Hard amuses while offending reviewWith their comic collaboration Get Hard Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart seek to make you laugh while also risking offense by going too far. They succeed on both counts.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. March 26 2015Get HardStarring Will Ferrell Kevin Hart Craig T. Nelson and Alison Brie. Directed by Etan Cohen. 100 minutes. Opens Friday at major theatres. 14AGet Hard is a blunt instrument of comedy.Think of it like a Three Stooges poke in the eye. Or a Monty Python riff on ultra-violent Sam Peckinpah movies. Or an Anchorman street rumble between competing newsreaders.Article Continued BelowIn other words the movie seeks to make you laugh while also risking offense by going too far. It succeeds on both counts.Will Ferrell left and Kevin Hart go to extremes to send up stereotypes of racism and homophobia in Get Hard.  (Patti Perret / Warner Bros.)  Get Hard co-stars Will Ferrell as a naive and falsely convicted moneyman attempting to dodge sexual assault in prison with Kevin Hart as his accidental thug life coach. Will Ferrell fearlessly goes for the hard laughsFerrells James King is ignorant of anything that doesnt have a dollar sign in front of it but hes no criminal. Accused of hedge-fund fraud at the family firm of his money-grubbing fiancee (Alison Brie) and future father-in-law (Craig T. Nelson) King is fearfully facing 10 years in Californias San Quentin State Prison.Terrified at the prospect of a decade of sexual assault from fellow inmates he seeks help from Darnell (Hart) a hardworking local carwash operator.James reasons that because Darnell is black statistically he must have spent time in jail. In fact Darnell is an upright citizen who has never been behind bars. Hes a family man with a wife (Edwina Findley Dickerson) and young daughter (Ariana Neal) whom he wants to move into a better neighbourhood. To do that he needs to raise 30000 -- something moneybags James will supply if Darnell can get him ""hard"" and ready for San Quentin. The con is on even through neither man knows what theyre really getting into.In broadly satirizing racism homophobia and prison rape theres no doubt that Get Hard will offend some people. This includes a few early critics following its SXSW world premiere in Austin Tex. last week who said the film itself is racist homophobic and makes light of sexual assault.I found it funny in the manner of Swiftian satire although you dont want to get too egghead about this. I enjoyed it because unlike similar films of its ilk everybody is in on the joke white and black straight and gay rich and poor men and women the typical and the stereotypical.Get Hard truly is an equal opportunity offender. Its not great cinema but its also not just a scattershot of dumbness and vulgarity even if it does set new records for penis and ""gay panic"" jokes. In sending up cliches it also twists them such as when King discovers that street toughs in a bad neighbourhood of L.A. think ""the stock market is gangsta""The film is the directorial debut of Etan Cohen who wrote or co-wrote such button-pushing pop culture attractions as TVs Beavis and Butthead and King of the Hill and the cult comedy films Idiocracy and Tropic Thunder. Cohen also co-wrote the Get Hard screenplay along with Jay Martel and Ian Roberts who help write the Key amp; Peele TV series of out-there sketch comedy.Ferrell and Hart make a good team. They take turns playing the scene-stealer and they really work the visuals of the tall doofus being ordered around by the short taskmaster.Is Get Hard offensive? Sure it is. But it made me laugh.This is by all means low comedy and sometimes the lowest yuks are the funniest ones.Read more about Will FerrellThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Review Will Ferrell Kevin Hart buddy up in the cliched Get Hard - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Will Ferrell Kevin Hart buddy up in the cliched Get Hard Get Hard movie review Warner Bros. Pictures Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell in ""Get Hard."" Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell in ""Get Hard."" (Warner Bros. Pictures) Betsy Sharkey A Kevin Hart-Will Ferrell pairing was only a matter of time. Too bad it was for sophomoric Get Hard Kevin Hart is Hollywoods current favorite comic it guy. Hes been playing the best black friend in one film after another ""Think Like a Man"" 1 and ""Too"" opposite Michael Ealy Jerry Ferrara Terrence Jenkins and Romany Malco; ""Ride Along"" 1 and soon to be 2 opposite Ice Cube; ""The Wedding Ringer"" opposite Josh Gad.A Hart-Will Ferrell pairing was only a matter of time. ""Get Hard"" the new R-rated prepping-for-prison-can-be-fun comedy starring Hart and Ferrell is certainly a better name than say ""Laugh Hard"" which you wont do nearly enough.There are plenty of intentionally un-PC jokes packed into the film. With Ferrell and Hart involved its probably impossible for anyone to completely resist their baser instincts to be amused by the patently offensive. Though its hard not to wish more moviegoers would. The tip-off for the tone is no surprise the title which is so transparently ripe for innuendo riffing that its almost embarrassing. Most of the jokes come at the expense of some group cliched-up to the nines. White collar blue collar gay straight black white male female gangbangers CEOs maids gardeners spoiled rich girls basically if you live or breathe on this planet ""Get Hard"" probably takes a stinging swipe at your ""type."" Etan Cohen director of Get Hard is used to confounding expectations Steven Zeitchik Imagination might carry us to new worlds but the people doing the imagining are often exactly as youd expect. The executive with the greatest influence on family entertainment is Pixar chief John Lasseter -- a jovial Hawaiian-shirt-wearing father of five. The creator behind some of the most notable... Imagination might carry us to new worlds but the people doing the imagining are often exactly as youd expect. The executive with the greatest influence on family entertainment is Pixar chief John Lasseter -- a jovial Hawaiian-shirt-wearing father of five. The creator behind some of the most notable... (Steven Zeitchik) But hey its all for a good cause right?We wouldnt want anything to slow the hyperkinetic Harts current juggernaut. And why come up with some creative unexpected comedy conceit when a retread of an idea will do? Because if theres anything weve learned from ""Paul Blart Mall Cop"" -- the Kevin James mall cop so very like his UPS driver in the long-running CBS sitcom ""The King of Queens"" -- when it comes to certain comics fans do not demand quality and ingenuity. If anything they seem to crave the same joke again and again. (Which is why well be seeing a second ""Mall Cop"" installment with James next month.) Get Hard trailer Trailer for ""Get Hard"" starring Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell Trailer for ""Get Hard"" starring Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell See more videos ""Get Hard"" is directed by Etan Cohen one writer of ""Tropic Thunders"" caustic farce. Hes one of the writers of ""Get Hard"" as well along with Jay Martel and Ian Roberts. The duo came up with the ""Hard"" idea along with the ubiquitous Adam McKay who is involved in pretty much everything Ferrell does -- writing directing producing props... Hart plays Darnell an articulate car wash entrepreneur looking for enough money to expand his business and get his wife (Edwina Findley Dickerson) and daughter (Ariana Neal) into a better/safer neighborhood. Ferrells newly indicted rich hedge fund guy James might be his ticket out of the ghetto.But before we get to the ahem Hart of the matter the filmmaker wants us to see and appreciate James lifestyle. Hes got a gorgeous modern manse in tony Bel-Air an equally gorgeous and anything but loving fiancee Alissa (Alison Brie) a fabulous job working for her billionaire father Martin (Craig T. Nelson) and a morning routine that includes yoga moves in the nude in front of his floor-to-ceiling windows. The gardeners are not amused.The dream soon turns into a nightmare when the feds charge James with racketeering. James pleads innocence and is quickly sentenced to hard time at maximum security Alcatraz. But first hes given a month of house arrest to get his affairs in order. His ankle bracelet allows him to roam freely across the L.A.-area basin. And in the typical fashion of the rich and the racially insensitive he turns to the only black guy he knows to get him ready to survive prison.Hello Darnell who runs the garage car wash operation in the same building that houses Martins hedge-fund business.Though his record is clean he signs on because his bank account needs a boost. For prison-life specifics Darnells conveniently got a cousin straight outta Compton a gangbanger named Russell played by rap star T.I. Fortunately James has a limitless supply of stereotypical beliefs that Darnell can manipulate to his advantage.The rest of the film runs on two parallel tracks. The primary one involves crazy things Darnell does to prepare James for prison -- this is where youll find most of the homophobic jokes that have drawn much well-deserved criticism. Helping James identify and entrap the scoundrel who set him up is the other.In between all the offense-riddled getting hard a real friendship between the men blooms.Interestingly Ferrell and Hart are much better together when they slip out of the shtick and rely on their acting talent -- both men have a nice soft side. It does make you wonder what might have happened if the movie had taken the idea and its execution up a notch. ""Get Hard"" just might have gotten better.Better yet its time for Hart to get a shot as the solo star.

Patti Perret/Warner Bros. Pictures hide caption toggle caption Patti Perret/Warner Bros. Pictures Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart in Get Hard. Patti Perret/Warner Bros. Pictures Get Hard a new Will Ferrell-Kevin Hart buddy comedy about a white-collar investor about to enter prison is funnier than the poster image of a white man in cornrows makes it appear. In an era where most comedies are either obsessed with genre self-awareness (think Phil Lord and Chris Miller) or still running on a male-id algorithm programmed in the 90s (think Adam Sandler. . . or dont) its refreshing to see one tuned into a present day that exists beyond the movies. Ferrell plays James King a pompous Bel Air one-percenter who practices capoeira on his mansions manicured front lawn and has sex with his young fiancee (Alison Brie) on top of floor plans for an even bigger mansion. On the eve of being made partner at his firm and shortly after soloing over John Mayer during a house party performance James is arrested for embezzlement and fraud and sentenced to 10 years in San Quentin State Prison. Meanwhile his car washer Darnell (Hart) is fighting to get his family out of the troubled L.A. neighborhood of Crenshaw and into the middle class. A racially motivated misunderstanding leads to a business opportunity hiding his squeaky-clean record Darnell will train James in the way of prison culture so he can survive on the inside. Give credit where credit is due This is a great concept for a comedy in 2015. It allows the filmmakers to play hot-button bingo with race class and the prison-industrial complex in ways that feel dangerous without being crass. Take the funny bit where Darnell trying to demonstrate his faux-toughness refers to his wife in a derogatory manner and is immediately punished for it. The joke sides with his wife. And James assumption that Darnell went to prison raises questions obviously about the ideas he carries which are hardly unique to his fictional self. Later Darnell enlists Jamess underpaid groundskeepers -- clad in hand-me-downs like a ""Too Big To Fail-Palooza"" business retreat T-shirt -- to assist the ""hardening"" process. The movie walks a fine line but it never goes sour because it keeps punching up. Get Hard is the feature directorial debut of Etan Cohen whose name has appeared on many a comedy screenplay from the meta-referential silliness of Tropic Thunder to the cult dystopia Idiocracy. His approach here is lo-fi mostly confined to a couple of sets and simple static shots of Ferrell and Hart riffing. Cohen plays up their real-life height differentials often returning to medium shots of the very short Hart successfully intimidating the very tall Ferrell (Hart often outshines his co-star with his hilarious physicality). It could be mistaken for one of those cheap grungy films aspiring comics shoot in their backyards were it not for the scripts four credited writers and cushy story arc -- the latter half featuring rapper T.I. as a gang leader is more plot-driven and less funny. Other comedy directors should take note not to surround charismatic stars with excess story fat. In whats sure to be the movies most-discussed set piece James trains himself to perform a sexual act he expects to encounter in prison and gets closer to the deed than the male hero of any other studio comedy in recent memory. Is this the latest iteration of that most dreaded style of humor the gay-panic joke? Not really; the scene is about James specific desperation his fear of uncharted waters and believe it or not his can-do spirit. After breaking out with stand-up specials Hart has so far mostly played the ringer in ensemble films (About Last Night the Think Like A Man series). But his film career has been on a huge upswing with last years buddy comedy Ride Along a smash. He brings a fresh manic presence that helps enliven Ferrell whos been making variations on the same movie for his decade-plus of stardom. Get Hard largely sheds the situational absurdity of Ferrells recent output like Anchorman 2 and Casa De Mi Padre which were more about outrageous concepts than the comic potential of their star. Its still ultimately a disposable work but at least while its going it hits hard.

Associated Press By Sandy Cohen The Associated Press Posted 03/26/15 1041 AM EDT | Updated on 03/26/2015  Comments Kevin Hart left and Will Ferrell appear in a scene from ""Get Hard."" Associated Press Get Hard A Warner Bros. release is rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America for ""pervasive crude and sexual content and language some graphic nudity and drug material.""Running time 99 minutes.Review   1/2 While the stereotypes in ""Get Hard"" may be gross exaggerations its characters live in the real world A place where the chasm between rich and poor is vast and growing; where black men are disproportionately jailed and white-collar criminals often evade punishment. In this comedy from first-time director Etan Cohen James (Will Ferrell) is a Los Angeles millionaire hedge-fund investor whose life of indulgence and ignorance is interrupted by a surprise prison sentence for fraud. He turns to the guy who runs the company car wash Darnell (Kevin Hart) -- apparently the only black person he has ever met -- and asks for help to prepare for 10 years in maximum security. Darnell has no jail experience but he agrees because he needs money to buy a home in a better school district for his little girl. When Darnells wife Rita (Edwina Findley Dickerson) -- the films only voice of reason -- asks what he did to give the impression he had a criminal record he replies ""I was being black."" Darnells pre-jail prep class includes transforming his students Bel-Air mansion into a pretend prison the household staff gleefully becoming its guards. Lessons include getting James in shape teaching him how to fight and encouraging him to practice oral sex on men. Advertisement The first yields some laughs as the 6-foot-3 Ferrell uses the diminutive Hart as a barbell. But forced sex isnt funny no matter whos doing the forcing or the gender of the parties involved. ""Get Hard"" traffics in other crude humor involving more than one look at Farrells naked tush and a tiring amount of puns on the films title. Darnell knows one real ex-con his cousin Russell (an ultra-charismatic Tip ""T.I."" Harris) whom he turns to for actual help for James behind bars. James hits it off with Russell and his gangster pals when he shows them how they can ""liquidate two bricks of cocaine"" into hedge funds to make more money. ""Wall Street man. Those are the real criminals"" one gangster says. Right. This is supposed to be a parody of the One Percent. The film is guilty of occasionally underlining its jokes like this. James even uses the phrase ""teachable moment"" after a heated racial encounter -- and not ironically. Stars and producers of ""Get Hard"" defended the film after its premiere at South by Southwest last week where some viewers and critics called it racist and homophobic. So when does satire become an expression of the very sentiment it hopes to ridicule? James initial bias against blacks is overt. Hes afraid of Darnell when they first meet and openly assumes he has been to jail because of his race citing the statistical likelihood. That can work as satire. But when Darnell misses all of James literary references is that satire or is it racist and classist? James has two female love interests one white and one black. The black woman does more twerking than speaking on screen. Does that satirize a racist and sexist stereotype or reinforce it? Its tricky territory to tread and ""Get Hard"" doesnt always get it right but in a nation where racial and economic divides are growing issues it deserves credit for trying. The film stays afloat on the goofy charm of its two leads a great soundtrack with music from Nicki Minaj T.I. and The Pharcyde and an undercurrent of truth. Los Angeles is a real reflection of economic disparity from the Colosseum-like grandeur of James Bel-Air home to the magnetometers in front of (fictional) Lower South Central elementary school. The country really does have a prison problem jailing more of its citizens than anywhere in the world black men at six times the rate of whites. One of the biggest leaps here is that a wealthy Wall Street scoundrel would be facing hard time. Follow AP Entertainment Writer Sandy Cohen at www.twitter.com/APSandy .

Unlike Bernard Madoff hes as innocent as a babe in the Wall Street woods. Kevin Hart is Darnell an earnest entrepreneur with a modest carwash business.

Warner Bros. Get Hard    (out of five) Director Etan Cohen Cast Will Ferrell Kevin Hart T.I. Rated R (pervasive crude and sexual content strong language graphic nudity drug material) Running time 100 min. By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 407pm on Thursday Mar. 26 2015 Thursday Mar. 26 2015 Thursday Mar. 26 2015 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Get Hard the prepping-for-prison would-be comedy starring Will Ferrell and comedian-of-the-moment Kevin Hart is about as funny as life imprisonment without the possibility of parole -- or laughter.Hart stars in a role that sounds similar to the one from his last film The Wedding Ringer in which hes the black guy who has to teach the geeky white guy life lessons on how to survive an upcoming emotional upheaval. In the prior movie it was getting married and in Get Hard its a 10-year stint in a max-security facility for corporate fraud and embezzlement.The trouble is that Darnell (Hart) while living on the margins in South Central Los Angeles with his wife (Edwina Findley Dickerson) and daughter (Ariana Neal) doesnt have so much as a traffic ticket to tarnish his record. He runs a car-wash business in the building where successful Wall Street trader and unthinkingly racist James (Ferrell) works and becomes James go-to guy when the businessman realizes hes being sent to the big house and doesnt know how to toughen up to survive. James turns to Darnell because he assumes the black man washing his car has a record and can teach him the ways of the cell block.At first Darnell balks but when James agrees to pay him 30000 he plays along promising to turn James from a smirking yuppie with a house in Bel Air to a hardened convict with a ""mad-dog"" face. James mansion is refashioned into a prison with his Hispanic household staff acting as fellow prisoners and guards and then school is in session.In a better world Get Hard might have been an incisive yet raucous look across the racial income and criminal divide. Heck forget that it might have just been funny. In this duller lesser world its a tired fish-out-of-water story weighed down by middle-school jokes involving penises prison rape and oh yeah more penises. An excursion to a West Hollywood gay bar is painfully unfunny.If theres a saving grace its found in Hart whose firecracker energy should be harnessed to power the electric grid. Theres a scene in which while showing James how to handle himself on the prison yard he plays three distinct characters -- one black one Latino and one black and gay. Its a couple of minutes of unrivaled hilarity that the rest of the movie cant match and whats worse first-time feature director Etan Cohen ( not to be confused with Ethan Coen of the Coen brothers) working from a script he wrote with two others doesnt seem to try that hard. Its as if he thought just putting Hart and Ferrell on the same set would be enough. Speaking of which Ferrell is fine and as usual throws himself into the role with enthusiasm but most of the material just isnt worth the effort. Some of the supporting players especially a convincing turn from rapper T.I. as the head of an L.A. gang and surprise John Mayer as John Mayer provide some diversion from the dearth of real humor.By the time Get Hard limps into its final act -- turning from My Fair Lady with two dudes into generic comic-thriller with two dudes -- it has totally lost whatever steam it had and squandered much of its comedic potential. Since anyone who has seen the trailer has already seen many of the films best moments making it through to the end does feel like something of a life sentence.

Comments click to enlarge Get Hard Video Rated R  99 minutes  2015 Will Ferrell stars as a Bel Air stockbroker whos convicted of defrauding investors and sentenced to ten years in San Quentin; Kevin Hart is the South Central car-wash owner who posing as an ex-con agrees to school the money man on how to survive in prison. Anal rape jokes and racial stereotypes dominate this third-rate comedy which cant help but recall Trading Places (1983) with its class-war story pairing a hot black comic and a past-his-prime white one. By the end the Ferrell character has learned to appreciate black booty and the Hart characters gangbanger buddies have become students of the stock market; you can call that racial healing I guess in the same way that a broken bone heals when it isnt set properly.

USA TODAYWill Ferrell left is headed to prison and seeks coping skills from Kevin Hart in ""Get Hard.""(Photo Patti Perret Warner Bros. Pictures)Get Hard is hard to sit through and hardly funny. So unless youre really hard up for entertainment stay away from this tone-deaf raunchfest.Perhaps theres an edgy dark comedy to be made about race class and the prospect of facing prison but Get Hard is not it (1/2 out of four; rated R; opens Friday nationwide).Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart seem like inspired odd-couple casting. But the lowbrow mess thats written for them doesnt do justice to their talents.The jokes are a cavalcade of racist and homophobic humorlessness and the story feel amateurish and cobbled together.Its a flimsy high concept James (Ferrell) is a millionaire hedge fund manager convicted of fraud. He approaches Darnell (Hart) who washes his car for help in toughening him up for his 10-year sentence in San Quentin. He assumes Darnell is an ex-felon merely because hes black. Statistically he points out 1 in 3 African-American men have spent time in prison. Though James makes 20 million in one phone call he tips Darnell 2 and lectures him arrogantly about the value of hard work. Given James obnoxious sense of entitlement stinginess and stereotypical assumptions the audience will likely wish that he gets shivved on his first day behind bars.But it turns out hes actually innocent of the charges. In fact this is one of the films many missteps. James goes from being a buffoonish one-percenter to a well-meaning innocent whos been framed. Were meant to like him as much as we like Darnell. So in order for that to happen the filmmakers have to change the initial contour of his character in radical ways.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Despite its not-so-stellar reviews USA TODAYs Carly Mallenbaums has several reasons to see the Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell comedy Get Hard. Sure one of those reasons is ""you dont care about plot"" but still. Also audiences have to buy that a guy so clueless and moronic could somehow be a stock market whiz. And then theres the matter of his being sentenced to hard time instead of a country club prison.The nerdy Darnell has never been in trouble with the law. Hes never even had a parking ticket. What he does have is a loving wife (Edwina Findley Dickerson) and a bright daughter (Ariana Neal) who is stuck in a dangerous school district. In order to move to a safer neighborhood Darnell needs 30000 for a down payment.So Darnell goes along with James assumptions and offers to get the goofball millionaire confinement-ready for a fee.The movie is a drawn-out litany of race-related gags and jokes about gay sex behind bars. Given that weve reached an era of greater tolerance the jocular homophobia seems particularly dated.The film is on better footing taking jibes at privilege and class divisions.Director Etan Cohen is not a good match for such immature material. He did a great job with 2006s hilarious Idiocracy and 2008s ridiculously funny Tropic Thunder. Both of those movies were offbeat outlandish and constructed tightly around much more clever premises.At times Harts manic energy and Ferrells willingness to play a dimwit come close to working but the script stops short of inspired humor.  12 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1bxUm2b",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/03/26/get-hard-review/25118841/,200,gethard19,gethard,usatoday

More about Get Hard >> Well if you do then Get Hard is the movie for you. Because when it comes down to it thats what Get Hard is An excuse to crack wise about how Will Ferrells milquetoast investment banker will never make it through a San Quentin stint without being intimately violated. Over. And over. And over again. Ferrell plays James King sentenced to prison for defrauding his financial clients. To survive his decade-long term King hires Darnell (Phillys own Kevin Hart) a car-wash owner who King assumes has gone to prison even though Darnell has never gotten even a parking ticket. But Darnell needs the cash to buy a house for his family in a better neighborhood. So he agrees to teach King to ""mad dog"" ""keister"" and generally survive in an environment with which neither he nor his timid student has any experience. The germ of an interesting idea in Get Hard is completely overshadowed by the onslaught of jokes meant to be boundary-pushing and edgy. Instead the script - by Jay Martel Upright Citizens Brigades Ian Roberts and director Etan Cohen - commits a sin worse than offense. The jokes are just too easy. Cohen and crew want to make light of race and class disparities and how these gaps in wealth and status invalidate the American dream as in the credit sequence when the rich and the poor are juxtaposed against each other. Classic comedies - including the Philadelphia-set Trading Places - have expertly worked these ideas into the fabric of their concepts. But why go for insight when there are several prison-rape jokes yet to be made? There is one odd positive note about Get Hard. Hart has spent most of his career playing the wacky funnyman character trading off his diminutive height and Napoleonic ego. Take his breakout Think Like a Man where he was the stock comic relief to the romantic goings-on of his friends. Or Ride Along where he played the fool to Ice Cubes straight man. Or even his role in his own BET sitcom The Real Husbands of Hollywood. In each he has made himself the butt of the joke. But in Get Hard just as in this years The Wedding Ringer opposite Josh Gad Hart gets a chance to be the more serious suave figure. Despite his ostensibly higher station Ferrells James is a man-child whom Hart must guide for his own survival. Hart gets to be the audience-relation point sharing with us the knowledge of his own scheme rather than the guy were supposed to laugh at. So we end up laughing at the rich white guy rather than the hardworking black man. Its a way for Hart to show a range that goes beyond the clown. Though Get Hard may try and fail at pushing boundaries at least Hart is pushing his own. Get Hard  (Out of four stars) Directed by Etan Cohen. With Will Ferrell Kevin Hart Tip Harris Craig T.

Photo Patti Perret / Associated Press Get Hard review 2 comedians deliver twice the laughs 1 / 2 Back to Gallery The way it usually works with screen comedies is that they get a funny guy and a straight guy and pair them off but ""Get Hard"" breaks the pattern. It matches up two comic actors and instead of clashing or canceling each other out they bring in the best possible result A comedy with twice the laughs. ""Get Hard"" is funny -- funny as in if youre eating something in the theater be courteous and try not to spray the people in the seats in front of you. Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart comedians of vastly different sizes and speeds somehow find their way into each others rhythms and the result is a memorable collaboration. As for the movie itself its a laugh machine nothing more than that but thats enough. All laugh machines should work this well. The comic gimmick the initial premise is surefire going in and then the filmmakers modify it and make it better James (Ferrell) a white stock trader about to go to prison for white-collar crime hires Darnell (Hart) a black ex-con to toughen him up so he can survive prison. But not exactly. Darnell isnt really an ex-con. James is so racially oblivious he just assumes that he is and Darnell needs the money and is willing to help. The filmmakers make a series of smart decisions. James is of course desperate which is ideal -- extreme emotions are always good for comedy -- but Darnell also cares. Hes not taking the money and running. Rather he sees this poor guy just days away from guaranteed annihilation and he wants to do something to give him a fighting chance. Subtly not in a way anyone would notice without looking for it the movie switches back and forth giving each comedian a chance to be the funny one and the other to lend support. For example when Hart has an extended comic bit when he acts out what James should expect in the prison yard Ferrell plays along. In another scene James practices trash talk so hell know how to tell people off while in the big house. But his variety of cursing is so bizarre that Darnell just sits there stunned not knowing how to react. Like most comedies these days ""Get Hard"" is harsh and goes to the edge of the R rating with moments that are close to shocking. At one point Darnell despairing of being able to help James decides that James only chance of surviving prison is to learn how to perform fellatio. So he takes him to a gay hangout and what follows is a mens room scene that goes about as far as a comedy can go. The movie plays with racial and sexual stereotypes in a knowing way. The days of the PG comedy in which the audience is ahead of the filmmakers are over at least for now. Theres a scene with white supremacists -- James needs their protection before he goes to prison -- and another in which James almost joins a black gang. Ferrell and Hart are good actors in addition to being funny so neither is uncomfortable holding still while the other gets the laugh. They listen to each other. They play off each other. They ground everything they do in terms of character and the laughs proceed from there. At times it seems as though they might be improvising. Theres something vital in their creative chemistry like they know they have to bring their best game or is it that theyre just pleased to be working with an equal? ""Get Hard"" is probably a one-off in that the story makes it difficult to imagine a sequel. But someone ought to figure out a way for Hart and Ferrell to keep working together.

Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Get Hard Etan Cohens comedy about a white stockbroker who hires a black man to prepare him for a 10-year stretch in San Quentin is like a spoon thats almost but not yet sharpened into a shiv. With just a little more effort it could kill.Judging by the poster in which Kevin Hart braids cornrows into Will Ferrells auburn curls Get Hard looks as hoary as a Night at the Apollo stand-up still flogging the old ""White people walk like this"" culture-clash shtick. In truth Ferrells ultra-rich James King does walk kinda funny. Sauntering past his worshipful underlings at the brokerage firm run by his fiancees (Alison Brie) father (Craig T. Nelson) Ferrell glides like a prize goose.Film Details Get Hard RatingR GenreComedy Running Time100 min. More Info Trailer But Get Hard is hunting another target not King but the privilege he represents. Intercut with glimpses of Kings Bel-Air life -- organic farmers markets brunchers ordering their dog its own plate of steak -- Cohen inserts shots of the have-nots begging for work outside of Home Depot and scrounging in trash cans for scraps. Darnells (Hart) situation isnt quite so dire. He has a house a family and a steady business washing cars in Kings tower. Still hes short the down payment he needs to move into a better school system than the one in Lower South-Central where his young daughter (Ariana Neal) is wanded by security guards.Upstairs in the office King makes the firm 28 million with one phone call. In the garage Darnell scrubs and sweats for fivers. Yet when Darnell gets up the nerve to ask King to invest in the future of his cleaning company Ferrell delivers a fatuous speech on the importance of hard work. Like the tight-fisted conservatives in Congress Ferrells Harvard-educated silver-spooner is so blind to his own privilege that when his boss brags about founding their agency with only ""me my computer and an 8 million loan from my father"" he applauds.

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm As befits their characters Hart acts like a normal human and Ferrell a cartoon. To enjoy Get Hard you have to get over two impossibilities 1) that a stock-market shark could be such a buffoon and 2) that when said white millionaire is accused of fraud the courts actually bother to sentence him to a decade in prison. (Even the judge delivering the ruling shrugs ""We dont usually do this."")Ferrells idiocy doesnt work. But his decency does. Instead of playing King as a callous corporate villain hes a well-meaning sap who sincerely believes hes a good person -- or at least certainly not a bigot. Mistaking Darnell for a carjacker he cant admit that it was because hes black swearing that hed have reacted the same if he were ""rich or poor or white or ... miscellaneous.""We empathize with King at least to a point. And so were both in on the joke and complicit in it when King mistakenly assumes that Darnell is an ex-con citing the one-in-three incarceration statistics for black men. His prejudice is the punch line. Still hes willing to pay Darnell 30000 to teach him to act tough. The extra twist is that King cant tell Darnell is a straight-arrow nerd. Darnells wife (Edwina Findley Dickerson) is sure King will see through his thug act. But Darnell simply puts on a black skullcap and lets cultural assumptions take care of the rest.Get Hard cant escape what its really about Kings fear of prison rape. (To bulk up Ferrell bench-presses Hart -- a good use of their foot-long discrepancy.) The script takes circuitous detours trying to find a way to make rape funny. One scene where Hart runs in circles pretending to be three different crews in a prison-rape showdown almost works thanks to Harts manic energy and Ferrells daft punch line ""Are there any French gangs?"" Another where Darnell drags King to a gay restaurant so he can practice sucking dick doesnt. Cohen earns points from casting the other patrons as normal non-stereotypes then squanders that credit when a man gets too persistent.The comedy is better when Cohen takes aim at benevolent racism. In an ideal world this would be Blazing Saddles for folks who chug kombucha. Yet its arguably harder to satirize race today than it was 40 years ago -- more sensitive times impose gentler jokes. A scene with a white-supremacist biker gang is an easy bulls-eye. Its harder to watch the conversation just before where Darnell tries to prepare his student to pass as racist by having King call him the N-word. King chokes it out and Darnell whipcrack-fast clocks him in the jaw. ""A reflex"" he apologizes. This June the exact same punching gag will pop up in the Sundance hit Dope. In 2015 we can talk bluntly about color -- but there will be consequences. Even Mel Brooks would get smacked.Still Get Hard is most comfortable -- and funny -- when Cohen gets back to skewering class warfare. After Darnell turns Kings mansion into a mock prison the maids and gardeners play-act at treating their master as an inmate. They dont say much but their smiles speak volumes. Chaplins Little Tramp would be proud. And then hed roll his eyes as if to say ""Its been 85 years since the Great Depression and you guys are still working this out?""GET HARD | Directed by Etan Cohen | Written by Cohen Jay Martel Ian Roberts and Adam McKay | Warner Bros. | Citywide Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

""Get Hard"" ""Get Hard"" ""Get Hard"" ""Get Hard"" a comedy pairing that stars Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart is about dumb people who do dumb things.The problem is this isnt ""Dumb and Dumber.""The films numbing lack of intelligence exhibited from the start makes ""Get Hard"" tough to watch even by Hart/Ferrell standards. Ferrell will emerge from this disaster unscathed; for Hart its further proof that he needs to focus on finding a truly good movie role for a change.A black-and-white buddy comedy on the heels of Harts black-and-white buddy comedy ""The Wedding Ringer"" ""Get Hard"" tries too hard to shock viewers with outrageous set pieces. Instead theyre left dumbfounded at the lack of any real wit.James (Ferrell) is a wealthy hedge fund manager living in a Bel Air mansion stocked with a Hispanic staff thats subjected to his frequent nudity. His beautiful wife Alissa (Alison Brie) who is up to no good also happens to be the daughter of his boss Martin (Craig T. Nelson).On the other side of town is Darnell (Hart) a well-meaning family man with a struggling car wash company. He cleans James vehicle regularly but that doesnt stop James from acting as if Darnell is mugging him when he approaches him.But when James is convicted of embezzlement and fraud and sentenced to jail time he needs help. Terrified of prison rape James enlists Darnell the only black guy he knows to toughen him up. They decide to turn his mansion into a mock prison so James can go through a litany of exercises to prepare him for life behind bars.Darnell introduces James to African-American street gang leader Russell (Tip ""T.I."" Harris) to gain some extra protection. He also has James infiltrate a Nazi-like gang for yet another level of protection. Its not until near the end of the film that the pair realizes a better plan would be to figure out who framed James in the first place.This mess is guilty of harboring shades of both racism and homophobia (something those involved with the film are finding themselves answering to).

PHOTOS SNLs most successful cast members Far away. As in The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel far away. Think crude R-rated jabs at race gender and homosexuality. But while the comedy is an equal opportunity offender perhaps its most egregious crime is that most of the jokes land with an awkward thud. Ferrell goes ultrabroad here playing what amounts to Buddy the Elf in a suit and tie. As James King hes an endearingly spoiled millionaire investor with a Bel Air mansion and a young and pretty fiancee (Alison Brie underutilized). She dresses up in sexy lingerie and gets John Mayer to serenade him at a party. Life is goooood. PHOTOS Celebs whove lost or gained weight for movie roles Then boom Hes arrested for embezzlement and fraud Bernie Madoff-style and sentenced to 10 years in a maximum-security prison. But first he gets to spend 30 days under house arrest. Terrified and in tears he offers 30000 to his car washer Darnell (Kevin Hart) to help him toughen up and ""get hard"" for prison life. See he assumes that Darnell is an ex-convict because of his skin color. And he wears hoodies. (There are more uninspired stereotypes where that came from.) But hes really just a clean-living working-class family man living in South Central L.A. -- and strapped for cash. Darnell agrees to the deal and amazingly his wifes only reaction is mild incredulity because he has never been a thug. (Good thing he has a relative who spent time in the slammer. Because of course.) PHOTOS Famous funny faces First he teaches James how to make a gruff ""mad dog face."" Then he turns his tennis courts into a prison yard and runs physical drills. Theres a prison riot reenactment too. Some of it amuses Indeed the sight of 6-foot-3 Ferrell taking orders from 5-foot-4 Hart is a worthy gag in itself and the stars try their mightiest to measure up to their comic personas -- the former as a loveable doofus; the latter as an insecure fast-talking jester. Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart in ""Get Hard"" Patti Perret Too bad they didnt work with a sharper script Instead the two must make do with stale and obvious jokes about rape and gay panic -- and puns about ugh the title of this movie. In one head-shaking example the two go to lunch during which Darnell repeatedly tells James that he must learn how to ""s--k a c---."" Cue the uncomfortable bathroom encounter. PHOTOS Stars rewear iconic movie costumes And after it seems like there are no more racially insensitive jokes to mine James -- now working a street persona and using the nickname ""Mayo"" (short for mayonnaise) -- hangs with a white supremacy gang. Its lame and on a taste level questionable at best. And it took three screenwriters to craft it. (Ironically the cleanest most nuanced jokes go over best. Hart does a hilarious riff on the plot of Boyz N the Hood topped only by his wifes sly line referencing The Blind Side. Later in that family dinner his droll young daughter nearly walks off with the whole film.) Still the one-joke premise has its limitations. And by the final act the entire fish-out-of-water concept is scrapped as Hart and Ferrell play bumbling cops and robbers and attempt to solve a crime. Havent we been punished enough?

Entertainment Inc. Will Ferrell appears in a scene from ""Get Hard."" (AP Photo/Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.) Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A millionaire convicted of fraud seeks advice on surviving in prison. Rated R. BOTTOM LINE Hart and Ferrell may not be Pryor and Wilder but they score several laughs in this slim comedy. CAST Will Ferrell Kevin Hart Tip ""T.I."" Harris LENGTH 140 For a comedy about a wealthy white guy trying to act like a black criminal ""Get Hard"" achieves two impressive feats. It squeezes a fair amount of laughs from a limited joke and equally surprising manages to be mostly inoffensive. On both counts much credit goes to the movies two appealing stars. Will Ferrell plays James King a Los Angeles hedge fund manager wrongly convicted of fraud while Kevin Hart plays Darnell a valet from whom James seeks advice on how to survive in prison. Why Darnell? Well because hes black -- and as James points out one in three African-American men will serve time in jail. ""Statistical analysis"" James says smugly ""is what I do."" advertisement | advertise on newsday Thats a rare glimmer of sharp comedy in the otherwise broad-humored ""Get Hard"" which is essentially an extended version of the ""get bad"" scene in ""Stir Crazy"" the 1980 prison comedy with Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor. Most of the Ferrell-Hart routines are simple slapstick -- weightlifting self-defense training and so on. Only a few scenes involving a crew of gangbangers (led by rapper Tip ""T.I."" Harris as Russell) portray Ferrell as a specifically Caucasian fish out of water. The fact that Darnell is not really a former felon but a squeaky-clean family man is a gentle twist though not a terribly important one. Etan Cohen makes his directorial debut with ""Get Hard"" from a script he wrote with Jay Martel and Ian Roberts both of Comedy Centrals ""Key and Peele."" Very occasionally the filmmakers tiptoe into social commentary. The opening credits juxtaposing Bel-Air mansions against ratty auto-loan storefronts are surprisingly pointed and theres a brief scene in which James teaches a young gangster how to steal quite legally using financial instruments. These real-world nods might come from producer Adam McKay who managed to insert a rant against Wall Street in his 2010 comedy ""The Other Guys."" In ""Get Hard"" Ferrell and Hart successfully play to type -- the delusional blowhard and the beleaguered underdog respectively -- but theyre very nearly the only two actors in the film. Alison Brie as James gold-digging fiancee and Craig T. Nelson as his boss appear only briefly. A little diversity in that sense might have helped.

Pictures)Story Highlights2.5 stars (out of 5)Ferrell and Hart are funny particularly because Hart tones down his manic act.Too frequently Cohen is tone deaf when it comes to the cultures he satirizes.""Get Hard"" is objectionable on so many grounds with a tone-deaf approach to racism and homophobia.It also on occasion is pretty funny.Quite the quandary.Will Ferrell plays James King a wizard of Wall Street who lives with his beautiful fiancee (Alison Brie) in an enormous Bel Air mansion. Its not enormous enough for her of course. But her father Martin (Craig T. Nelson) makes James a partner in his firm with the promise of enough riches to buy an island.Then at their engagement party (in which John Mayer performs playing up a nice parody of his ladies man image) the feds burst in and arrest James for fraud. Martin begs him to accept a plea deal but James wants a trial and gets one -- followed by a 10-year sentence in San Quentin from a judge whos tired of the 1 percent getting away with everything.The same could be said of director Etan Cohen whos one of six writers credited on the film which spends a fair amount of time bashing the super wealthy and their casual disregard of anyone and anything that doesnt help line their pockets.James has 30 days to get his affairs in order. Ferrell is funny as a desperate man who spends a few days crying and a few more trying to escape before he hits upon an idea He will hire Darnell (Kevin Hart) who washes his car to teach him how to survive in prison.Why Darnell? James claims statistical analysis shows that one in three Black men have spent time in prison. So he tells Darnell you must have been right?Wrong. Darnell is a straight-laced family man trying to save enough to move his family into a nicer neighborhood so that his daughter can go to a school that doesnt have metal detectors. So he accepts the 30000 James is willing to pay and comes up with a nitwit program to toughen him up and avoid the constant prison rape Darnell assures him awaits.This is a horrible idea for a movie. It is however a decent idea for an extended sketch and thats how the first two-thirds of the movie plays. Darnell turns James mansion into a model of a prison; the abused servants are all too happy to serve as guards.Its all wildly uneven but some bits really are funny. Ferrell plays his usual clueless character but hes good at it. And it turns out a toned-down Hart is a funnier Hart.But Cohen cant keep a handle on it all. Worse he has no feel for when the satire goes too far. A bit in which Darnell concocts a story about how he wound up in prison is familiar (overly so) and funny. A bit set in a gay coffee shop on the other hand is outrageously offensive and makes no sense in the context of the movie.Effective satire while not afraid to offend displays insight into the subject it is making fun of. (Think ""Borat."") Cohen certainly knows whats funny -- the more absurd the situation the better as with a mock prison riot -- but he clearly has no working knowledge of the worlds hes trying to send up.A subplot in which James and Darnell try to figure out who really broke the law and framed James is stupid and predictable. Then again you dont watch a Will Ferrell-Kevin Hart comedy thinking youre tuning into ""Sherlock.""With ""Get Hard"" its a question of balance and ultimately the bad outweighs the good.Get Hard2.5 stars (out of 5) Director Etan Cohen.Cast Will Farrell Kevin Hart Alison Brie.Rating R for pervasive crude and sexual content and language some graphic nudity and drug material.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Ann Hornaday March 26 2015 Follow AnnHornaday ""Get Hard"" opens with a tight close-up of Will Ferrell weeping -- openly copiously theatrically -- in what has become his signature gesture of doing something banal to an absurd extreme. In this scattershot funny-dumb satire Ferrell plays James a Los Angeles financier whose arrest for fraud interrupts his life as a one-percenter. He enlists the help of Darnell (Kevin Hart) the guy who washes his car to help him prepare for prison assuming that if its true that one in three black men will end up behind bars its statistically likely that a menial laborer will have done time at some point. In fact Darnell owns the carwashing company is a devoted husband and father and aspires to move his family into a better school district. But in exchange for the down payment on a house hes willing as he explains to his wife to ""be every stereotype [James] thinks I am."" The result is a fish-out-of-water buddy comedy that -- when its working -- also does a smartly scathing job of sending up privilege entitlement and crony capitalism the whole phenomenon as its been said of being born on third base and thinking youve hit a triple. Or as Jamess weaselly boss played by Craig T. Nelson puts it starting with nothing ""just me my computer and an 8 million loan from my father."" Written by Jay Martel Ian Roberts Etan Cohen and Adam McKay ""Get Hard"" punctuates those ironic zingers with broader more low-brow physical set pieces most of which pivot around Harts diminutive height and Jamess fear of being raped in prison. The dubious merit of tiresome ""dont drop the soap"" jokes aside ""Get Hard"" sometimes veers perilously close to committing the very sins it aspires to criticize. The movie is drenched in gay panic. (One of those set pieces takes place in the bathroom of a West Hollywood restaurant where James forces himself to practice the sexual technique he so fears hell have to get used to.) And when the two men enlist the services of Darnells street-toughened cousin some of those stereotypes Darnell invoked earlier -- from gangbangers to twerking hoochie mamas -- come floridly and lazily into play. Darnell (Kevin Hart) plays up to stereotypes to find help for his prison-bound benefactor James (Will Ferrell) in ""Get Hard."" (Patti Perret/AP) Still Ferrell and Hart have a genial easygoing chemistry and ""Get Hard"" manages to score more than a few good points about facile assumptions and toxic hypocrisy. In a patronizing but on-point wish-fulfillment sequence James helps Darnells cousin to monetize his ill-gotten gains by way of complex computer trading programs resulting in exponential growth of his portfolio. ""The stock market is gangsta"" one of his minions exclaims. Elizabeth Warren couldnt have put it better. R. At area theaters.

"Get Hard review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review Get Hard Get Hard Patti Perret /Warner Bros. Entertainment Kevin Hart top and Will Ferrell appear in a scene from ""Get Hard."" Kevin Hart top and Will Ferrell appear in a scene from ""Get Hard."" (Patti Perret /Warner Bros. Entertainment) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune A misbegotten script gets the awkward direction it deserves in this Will Ferrell/Kevin Hart misfire. An awful lot of ""Get Hard"" depends on gay-panic humor of a weirdly squirmy and dated sort making you wonder if this new Will Ferrell/Kevin Hart mystery might best be viewed alongside reissues of ""Cruising"" and ""Norman ... Is That You?""I call it a mystery because thats what it contains -- a series of mysteries. Its a mystery why two bona fide comic stars working very very hard to keep this thing from tanking couldnt pressure their collaborators for another rewrite or three. Its a mystery why first-time feature director Etan Cohen a talented screenwriter (""Idiocracy"" ""Tropic Thunder"") couldnt figure out how to film the simplest dialogue exchanges or the violence. Hobbled by a nervous insecure editing rhythm and a total lack of slapstick finesse ""Get Hard"" represents a matchup of form and content that does the people on screen no favors.Ferrell plays James King a stuffy hedge-fund wizard with a duplicitous gold digger (Alison Brie) for a fiancee (cant get enough of that cliche) and a lifetime of unexamined prejudices and privileges about to catch up with his sorry white self. Framed and arrested for fraud and embezzlement King hires carwash manager Darnell (Hart) whom he mistakes for a hardened ex-con to school him in prison survival and sexual assault prevention in a 30-day runup to San Quentin. Most of ""Get Hard"" is a training montage played out in slow motion. Harts character exists to guide the redemption of Ferrells protagonist. The script by Jay Martel Ian Roberts and director Cohen is witlessly coarse. Even the showoff sequences such as Hart impersonating three different thugs in a training exercise fall flat and betray all sorts of strain. Between this film and the recent Seth Rogen/James Franco North Korea lark ""The Interview"" youd think Hollywood knows how to write exactly one sort of joke the kind that depends on somebody inserting or removing an object from his rear end. Check out the latest movie reviews from Michael Phillips and the Chicago Tribune. On the venerable film website IMDb.com one of the discussion threads regarding ""Get Hard"" says it all ""Penis scene was shocking."" It certainly will be for many folks.The shock however relates to the bathroom stall scenes mind-boggling klutziness both in the staging and editing as physical comedy -- clearly there were trims here to avoid an NC-17 rating -- and not so much the body part itself. I mean why blame the guest star? Its only as good as its material.Is the movie homophobic and racist? Id say sort of and sort of. Many have said so ever since the disastrous premiere at South by Southwest. Gay-panic humor isnt quite the same thing as homophobia but its close enough to be tiresome. And like the uneasy scene in ""Anchorman 2"" when Ferrell talks jive and ""acts black"" ""Get Hard"" attempts to mine humor from putting an uptight clueless 1-percenter in South Central Los Angeles dressing like Lil Wayne and teaching Crenshaw gang members to work the stock market. I laughed when Ferrell smashed a bottle of beer on the sidewalk just to show hes tough but if thats a movies standout bit that movies no standout. The real mystery is this Can ""Get Hard"" make enough money in its first week to counteract the likely word-of-mouth? On the way out of a recent promotional screening the audience seemed subdued. Maybe they were rattled by the penis scene. But maybe they just know a poorly crafted comedy when they see one.""Get Hard"" - 1 starMPAA rating R (for pervasive crude and sexual content and language some graphic nudity and drug material)Running time 140Opens Fridaymjphillipstribpub.comTwitter phillipstribune Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Reviews Review Danny Collins Review Home Review Kumiko the Treasure Hunter Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising71deg",http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/chi-get-hard-20150326-column.html#navtype=barker&barkername=Barker%2006%20-%20In%20Case%20You%20Missed%20It,200,gethard28,gethard,chicagotribune

Share Tweet Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart look like a comedy team. When the towering beady-eyed Ferrell shares a frame with the diminutive fast-talking Hart in their comedy Get Hard they can get laughs or at least smiles just from their mismatched physicalities. Whether hes exercising tasteful restraint or just studio-comedy carelessness director and cowriter Etan Cohen doesnt lean heavily on this contrast. He arranges a few sight gags positioning Hart as a liftable throwable buddy for Ferrell the soft-bodied giant but more often Cohen is content to cut mechanically between one-shots of his stars.Ferrells comedies with Adam McKay have plenty of simply blocked scenes like that built around simple dialogue but McKay knows how to foster the kind of improvisation that enlivens less imaginative set-ups. McKay produced Get Hard with Ferrell and has a story credit which is about the amount his input is detectable in the final product. The story hook has McKays satirical edge picking up where The Other Guys left off regarding white-collar criminals Ferrell plays James King a financial executive arrested for fraud and wholly unprepared to deal with any punishment while Hart plays Darnell the owner of a small carwash who King mistakes for an ex-con. Following through on this racist assumption James hires Darnell to help prepare him for prison. Divisions between wealthy haves and hard working have-nots are clearly on the films mind as the opening credits roll over images juxtaposing wealthy white folks and non-white people serving them through more menial jobs.But before the movie has even really begun its already fudging its own premise and undermining its satire. James insists that hes innocent (and Ferrell seems too sheltered and fragile to be lying) and the filmmakers knowing full well how many white-collar criminals get off lightly have a judge sentence him to 10 years in a maximum security prison without any real explanation. Its the movies way of cutting to the chase but that expediency denies the story any kind of satisfying comic logic or escalation.Similarly when Darnell whos actually a middle-class striver who wants to earn money to move to a nicer neighborhood shows up with a multi-step lesson plan and helps James turn his mansion into a practice prison its not a McKay-style flight of surrealism; its just kind of inexplicable. The movie never explains why Darnell would go to such elaborate trouble for what could be a relatively simple scam and its not quite funny enough to make that leap without notice.Darnells curriculum mostly has to do with winning fights and/or avoiding prison rape. The bits where Ferrell practices his bravado with strange swearing patterns and misguided fight challenges are funny; the prison rape stuff though is predictable and predictably tiresome. At one point deciding that James might be better off learning to perform oral sex on other prisoners Darnell brings him to a gay-friendly pick-up spot and James attempts to practice oral sex on a guy played by Matt Walsh. The scene doesnt play especially homophobic--the joke is much more on Ferrells quivering squeamishness than the gay character--but its so muddled in its staging that whatever the punchline is supposed to be it doesnt land. The movie wants to get the shock laugh that comes from male nudity and then run away from the scene as fast as possible. It could be that Cohen and company share the same squeamishness as James but if they do it seems to apply to almost any comic situation. A later scene where Darnell encourages James to pursue membership in an all-white gang for his protection then must extract him from their clutches when it goes wrong should be an instant classic with Ferrell bluffing his way through racist rhetoric and Hart throwing himself into the fray. Instead from its preface (a car scene where Darnell gives James permission to use a noxious racial epithet) to its final conflict the sequence is more fitfully amusing than hilarious. Its jumpy and scattered instead of punchy.These scenes and others like them have some laughs but they dont even rise to the level of sketches; theyre more like skits. Ferrell and Hart are too likable and crowd-pleasing to let the movie collapse around them. But theyre also too talented for something this wan. Ultimately white-collar criminals only get a slightly more substantial ribbing than they would in a slobs-versus-snobs comedy. Ferrell and McKay have an admirable track record in the realm of broad studio comedy (Hart less so); for their team this one feels like a placeholder. Insert socially conscious comedy here.

Its a please-dont-let-me-get-raped-in-prison comedy--theres really no other way to put it--on top of which is layered a mock coating of racist hauteur tush-ogling sexism and plenty of sweaty gay panic. And still miraculously the movie doesnt feel mean-spirited so much as profoundly awkward. Scripted by smart guys like Etan Cohen (Idiocracy Tropic Thunder) and two behind-the-scenes writers on TVs consistently excellent Key amp; Peele the film feels both daring and foolhardy. If it succeeds at all its because the kids with the knives are so gloriously good at playing dumb. James King (Will Ferrell better as he ages) is a strutting Master of the Universe a super wealthy stock trader about to marry his bosss spoiled daughter (Alison Brie). When embezzlement charges rain down on him turning him into a media symbol of unchecked privilege he toys with Mexican flight in a fake mustache. Then he pleads with his longtime car washer Darnell (Kevin Hart terrific) whom he assumes has spent time behind bars (the guy is actually a married wine-sipping striver) to make him a mad dog. If the above makes you cringe thats the point. We may be past a moment when race comedies like 1983s Trading Places get an unquestioning pass. Get Hard actually feels more like Eddie Murphys debut 48 Hrs. especially during a scene in which James and Darnell find themselves confronting a room of white supremacists (their research takes them far and wide) with a flamethrower. Elsewhere the movie is too glib with stereotypes Scary Crenshaw gang members warm to Jamess money-management skills and start learning about IRAs. Still only the humorless will frown at Ferrells easy way with white-guy entitlement. ""Im going to be attending San Quentin"" the Harvard grad sniffs almost as a point of pride; later after tasting thug life he calls it an ""ambrosia of primal sensations."" The dude is trying which is the best you can say about Get Hard a film with its heart--if not its other body parts--in the right place.

Because the new Will Ferrell-Kevin Hart comedy recycles that same Wildean bit of thats-what-she-said wordplay about a thousand times. Ill just come right out and say it Get Hard is not only a bad movie but a profoundly wasted opportunity. Im sure there are a lot of fans of Ferrells and Harts out there (myself included) who were curious to see how the two stars unique comic styles would ricochet off each other--the formers oblivious blowhard lunacy against the latters yippy jack-in-the-box energy. But here both of them seem resigned to going after the lowest-hanging punchline fruit available. Its easily the laziest film either one of them has ever made. Ferrell plays James a superrich hedge-fund whiz whos happily engaged to a spoiled shrew (Alison Brie) whose scheming father (Craig T. Nelson) is his billionaire boss. James leads a charmed life that goes up in smoke when hes framed for securities fraud and embezzlement and is sentenced to a 10-year stretch in San Quentin. (You dont have to squint too hard to see the DNA of another black-white buddy comedy Trading Places in this setup. Ferrell is basically Dan Aykroyds Louis Winthorpe III and Hart is Eddie Murphys Billy Ray Valentine.) Knowing he wont last a second behind bars James offers Harts car washer Darnell--the only black man he knows--30000 to teach him how to make himself ""hard"" so he can survive in prison. The catch is Darnell despite being black has never been to jail. Hes just pretending to be the kind of thug James presumes he is to get the money for his family. Isnt racial profiling hilarious? Im willing to give Ferrell and Hart the benefit of the doubt and trust that theyre tweaking knee-jerk stereotypes rather than being Neanderthals. But theres a fine line between making a commentary on race and clumsily exploiting it for cheap laughs. Get Hard walks that line like a drunk taking a field sobriety test. The film doesnt have the light touch to make this gimmick work. As Darnell puts James through his prison-prep boot camp teaching him how to summon a mad-dog face fashion a shiv and hide said shiv in his keister the film spirals into an ever more toxic stew of gay-panic gags. It cant imagine anything worse--or more of a scream--than anal violation. Directed by Etan Cohen the screenwriter of the much-better Idiocracy and Tropic Thunder Get Hard dredges the bottom of the comedy barrel for 100 queasy minutes as Ferrell and Hart mug and yell and try not to look mortified. Both of them must have sensed deep down that they couldve come up with better material just by shredding the script and ad-libbing because there is a clever way to make this premise work. (Again Aykroyd and Murphy did it.) Instead they squandered what should have been an electric collaboration on a movie thats more tone-deaf than madcap.

(Patti Perret/Warner Bros. Pictures) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday March 25 2015 133 PM Title Get Hard Film Info With Will Ferrell Kevin Hart. Comedy about a rich guy who needs help preparing for prison. Director Etan Cohen (139). R Language sexuality nudity. Area theaters. ""Get Hard"" isnt edgy enough to be offensive or witty enough to be challenging. Its just dumb. This forced comedy received accusations of racism and homophobia from audience members and a critic after it screened earlier this month at the South by Southwest fest. And indeed the movie makes ""The Interview"" look like genius by comparison. But whereas many wannabe-offensive comedies earn the disdain hurled at them ""Get Hard"" as evidenced by its lame grade-school-joke of a title is just lazy empty-headed and moronic. Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell aim for edgy but come up short in ""Get Hard."" (Patti Perret/Warner Bros. Pictures) Will Ferrell plays James King an obnoxiously rich stockbroker about to marry the bosss daughter (Alison Brie) and make partner in his company. Then a trumped-up charge of swindling investors hits King resulting in 10 years in San Quentin. Enter Darnell Lewis (Kevin Hart) a struggling family man who works in the garage of Kings building. Lewis needs money to start a car-wash company. So for a fee he coaches a terrified King on how to survive being beaten up forced to partake in gay sex and get gang-initiated. Except Lewis has never actually been to prison. But that doesnt matter to King who just wants to avoid becoming ""somebodys bitch."" Alison Brie plays Alissa in the lame comedy ""Get Hard."" (Patti Perret/Warner Bros. Pictures) ""Trading Places"" this aint much less ""Stir Crazy."" But there is a scene at an L.A. restaurant with all-gay clientele that would have fit into a bad 80s movie. Cohen co-wrote the terrific ""Tropic Thunder"" and clearly can do envelope-pushing stuff. But while ""Get Hard"" pokes fun at racist attitudes theres no ingenuity or zing to Kings discomfort around anyone who doesnt look like he does. Will Ferrell seems to be slipping lately as evidenced by films like ""Get Hard."" (Patti Perret/Warner Bros. Pictures) Ferrell is overindulgent in his recent films as anyone who saw ""Anchorman 2"" and the interminable ""Casa de Mi Padre"" knows. Hes now best in short-form skits on his Funny or Die website. He can still turn his doughy face into mush -- and unfortunately likes showing off his doughy body -- but mostly this is too much of an awful thing. Hart comes off better. He delivers the movies liveliest scene when his character tries to prepare King for the types of people he might encounter in a prison yard. Lewis jumps between imitations of jail stereotypes -- a Puerto Rican gang member a gangsta a guy King thinks is a woman -- arguing with himself as hes running around. Its like something a young Robin Williams might have done and its the only time ""Get Hard"" makes it over the low bar it aims for.

Daily Edition Login to download Get Hard Film Review 934 PM PDT 3/16/2015 by John DeFore FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS A passably silly but lowbrow buddy comedy TWITTER Will Ferrell asks Kevin Hart to get him ready to do hard time. Get Hard? Get ready for a lot more double entendres is more like it in this buddy comedy whose premise -- doughy white finance guy (Will Ferrell) enlists black man (Kevin Hart) to prepare him for a 10-year prison term -- guarantees plenty of jokes about the many things men do consensually and otherwise in the slammer with their private parts. The two very different comedians work fairly well together here with an energized Hart (whose character hides the fact that hes barely more streetwise than his employer) running roughshod over a naive fearful Ferrell. Aiming low in a way that will scare off some of Ferrells fair-weather fans the pic is unimaginative but does a good enough job to please the rest of them (Fans of Hart should enjoy it more). Read more Will Ferrell Lip Syncs to Beyonce in Amazing Battle With Kevin Hart and Jimmy Fallon Ferrell plays James King a master of the universe whose oblivious sense of entitlement is simplistically drawn though Ferrell adorns it with a signature touch Kings propensity to parade naked through his Bel Air mansion both indulges the actors fetish for showing his ass and illustrates Kings disregard for the domestic workers who must endure this fleshy display. Kings cartoonishly materialistic fiancee (Alison Brie) is the daughter of the president of his firm (Craig T. Nelson) a cozy relationship for everyone. But these bonds evaporate when James is convicted of financial fraud. With only 30 days until his sentence begins King turns to the first person he sees who he assumes has relevant experience Since he knows a third of black American males do time at some point King assumes Harts car-wash guy Darnell Lewis knows what its like in the joint. Darnells a law-abiding family man but he sees an opportunity to make enough cash to get his family into a safer school district. So he agrees to be ""prison coach"" for James getting him tough enough to avoid 10 years of beatings and rape. Darnells initial shock-and-awe boot camp tactics are the most amusing part of the film though its hard to understand why they dont go further If you were given permission to terrorize and abuse a rich man whod always treated you like a peasant wouldnt you enjoy it a bit? Instead Darnell soon decides he wont succeed in teaching James to protect himself and should instead prepare him for a decade of sodomy. So he takes James to a gay brunch (?) and tells him to go learn how to perform certain oral favors. Read more SXSW Will Ferrell Kevin Hart Unveil Racial Comedy Get Hard Darnell also tries to set James up with people who can protect him in prison taking him to see Russell (Tip ""T.I."" Harris) Darnells cousin and the leader of a crew of thugs just as crudely imagined as the people in James Kings world. Before the movie gets too lost in examining the racial politics of prison life though Darnell and James realize there may be a way to prove his innocence and keep him from having to touch anybody elses penis. Heres hoping. Once or twice in the course of things Ferrell delivers a clueless-rich-guy line in a way that recalls the haughtiness of Dan Aykroyds Louis Winthorpe III in Trading Places. That film had more than a little in common with this one clashes of race and economic class a privileged mans fear of deprivation a black star who could put the world on hold with the sheer energy of his patter. But Get Hard premiered two hours ago and it already seems more dated than Trading Places -- not to mention less savvy about all the subjects it pretends to be addressing while it tries to make us laugh.

Edward Douglas ComingSoon.net ""Finally a comedy that homophobes racists and generally stupid people can all enjoy together"" Alex Needham the Guardian ""In years to come media studies students will ... be astonished that such a negative portrayal of homosexuality persisted in the mainstream in 2015."" Drew Taylor the Playlist ""Absolutely horrible ... a morally repugnant movie ... a non-stop parade of racist homophobic bile that would be bad enough from any comedian but coming out of Ferrell and Hart has the effect of watching a childhood hero committing some horrible act."" Somebody call the cops. Scanning these denunciations before seeing the movie I was prepared for an ordeal. Ferrell and Hart are two stars with clearly cleverly designed personalities but whose films are often lazy and coarse in execution. Id been warned that this first screen pairing of the 6-ft. 3-in. Ferrell and the 5-ft. 4-in. Hart was all about the fear of prison rape. R-rated bromances often go heavy on a blithe homoeroticism; this movie would make the anticipation of gay sex both explicit and terrifying. So during the first half-hour or so of Get Hard I was primed for a high atrocity factor. Primed and disappointed. One note I scribbled read ""Still waiting to hate this."" An hour in I realized to my shock that I was having a good time. Justin Chang of Variety would chalk this up to the ""unexamined homophobia needed to fully enjoy Get Hard."" But laughter trumps political fairness and Get Hard made me laugh at and with situations I hadnt thought could tickle me. The movie has a warm heart beating under its seemingly scabrous shell. In the script by Jay Martel and Ian Roberts (show runners of Comedy Centrals Key and Peele) Ferrells James is a successful fabulously wealthy hedge-fund manager -- a Wolf of Wall Street L.A. branch -- who has just made partner at the firm run by Martin (Craig T. Nelson). When not making millions each day at the office he frolics in bed with his fiancee and Martins daughter Alissa (Alison Brie) who seeps out of her peignoir to give him great sex and spur him to finance her gaudiest whims; shes James Lady Macbreast. Each morning James exercises nude -- mandatory Ferrell butt shot -- in full view of his gardening staff to whom he pays no more attention than to the black guy Darnell (Hart) who washes his car. Youll recognize James as that comedy stereotype the empowered idiot a cousin to Stephen Colberts TV persona. Ferrell has built his film career on playing guys who are cocooned in and sustained by an utterly unwarranted belief in themselves most enjoyably in Blades of Glory. In that and the Anchorman movies and here too hes not mean exactly -- just stupendously ignorant of certain social niceties and stupefyingly oblivious to the working-class people around him. James was born and bred in the 1% bubble. Like Mitt Romney hes learned what he needs to nosh on the upper crust but no ones taught him how to survive what for the bottom 47% is real life. So when he is charged and convicted on 76 counts of fraud and embezzlement for crimes he insists he did not commit and ordered to do his time in maximum-security San Quentin James plummets into panic. The very thought contorts his face into a Munchian scream. All he knows about prison to which he will be sent in 30 days is that its an unrelenting nightmare of enforced fellatio. As his lawyer (Greg Germann) predicts ""Hell be chokin on a mouthful of balls."" To toughen him up for hard time James needs a tutor and goes to the only black man he knows Darnell. James assumes that Darnell must be an ex-con because hes an African-American male. In fact Darnell is an upwardly mobile family man tending to his wife Rita (Edwina Dickerson) and young daughter Makayla (Ariana Neal). But hell take a big payday by pretending to be a gangsta -- he swipes his invented biography from the plot of Boyz n the Hood -- and putting James through a regimen of hurt. Imagine that the J.K. Simmons teacher in Whiplash were really a pussycat feigning sadistic intent to impress his naive pupil. The role is a twist for Hart no longer the bantam battler of Ride Along and Think Like a Man here hes the ordinary underdog the audience surrogate that skeptically appraises Ferrells character and eventually comes to accept it. Director Etan Cohen (who helped write King of the Hill Idiocracy and Tropic Thunder) pushes these clever conceits at a brisk pace while allowing his stars room to do their stuff Ferrells on-the-nose-pathetic impersonation of Lil Wayne Harts simultaneous playing of three cons -- black Hispanic and gay -- whom James could expect to get up in his face. Tip (T.I. Harris) brings sexy authentic menace to the role of Darnells gang-boss cousin. The movie flags only toward the end when James has a comedically flat encounter with some neo-Nazis then gets back on track by belatedly realizing its plot requires a whodunit resolution. By then youll recognize Get Hard as a modern gloss on the Dan Aykroyd-Eddie Murphy Trading Places a little ruder and not quite as sharp but in the ballpark of that 1983 comedy landmark. Yes the movie does have a middle section about James fear of enforced fellatio many jokes about Dickipedia and dick-ade and a fairly explicit toilet-stall rendezvous (with Veeps Matt Walsh). I will not arbitrate on the humor content of this episode. Ill just say that the adult audience for which Get Hard is designed should be able to get through it without gagging. You neednt approve ethically of everything in a movie you enjoy. And by ""you"" I mean this reviewer. His last words before he was hauled away by the critique police were ""I kind of liked Get Hard."" Read Next Your browser is out of date.

"Get Hard Review Will Ferrell Kevin Hart Deserve Better | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews SXSW Film Review Get Hard Justin Chang Chief Film Critic JustinCChang 17 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr March 17 2015 | 0137AM PT Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart deserve better than this tired excuse for an odd-couple comedy. If youre disturbed by white-collar crime but not quite as disturbed as you are by gay sex then congratulations You might possess just the right combo of social conscience and unexamined homophobia needed to fully enjoy ""Get Hard."" Not even two of Americas most reliable funnymen can eke consistent laughs out of this sloppy odd-couple comedy about a wrongly convicted millionaire (Will Ferrell) who asks the nearest black guy (Kevin Hart) to toughen him up in preparation for a decade behind bars -- a premise that allows for a few timely jabs at racial oppression and class disparity though its ultimately undone by some of the ugliest gay-panic humor to befoul a studio release in recent memory. None of this will likely matter a whit to Ferrells and Harts fan bases which are probably big enough to keep ""Get Hard"" from going too soft commercially. ""Success is a mountain"" filthy-rich hedge-fund manager James (Ferrell) is fond of declaring and it would appear that he has reached the summit. He shares his palatial Bel Air digs with his beautiful spoiled fiancee (Alison Brie); meanwhile his boss (Craig T. Nelson) who also happens to be his future father-in-law has just made him a partner in the firm. One of the movies better jokes is that a wealthy entitled white man in Jamess position will automatically assume the worst of a black man in a hoodie; that guy would be Darnell (Hart) a hard-working small-business owner whos trying to save up the 30000 he needs to start his own car wash in hopes of earning a better living for himself his wife (Edwina Findley) and their young daughter (Ariana Neal). As scripted by director Etan Cohen (who shared writing duties with ""Key and Peele"" showrunners Jay Martel and Ian Roberts) the movies opening scenes offer an appreciably scathing vision of One Percent excess complete with a Latino gardener (Erick Chavarria) who scowls behind Jamess (frequently naked) back. By contrast Darnell and his family enjoy a cramped but cozy existence in Crenshaw where his daughter passes through metal detectors every day on her way to class. But soon the tables are turned as James is arrested on charges of securities fraud and embezzlement; convinced of his innocence he turns down a plea bargain and winds up sentenced to 10 years in maximum-security prison. Abandoned by his fiancee and eventually her father and with only a month to go before he heads to San Quentin James turns to Darnell for help; after all given the statistic that one in three African-American men will be thrown in jail during his lifetime surely his one black friend must know a thing or two about what its like behind bars. And so with a promise of 30000 for his services Darnell willingly pretends to be an ex-con and spend the next month teaching James to bulk up and become as fierce and intimidating as possible. Because everyone knows what happens to flabby defenseless men who go to prison -- and just in case you dont know rest assured that ""Get Hard"" will disabuse you of your ignorance and then some. See MoreSXSW Will Ferrells Get Hard Stirs Controversy With Gay Racial Jokes ""You need to suck a d--"" Darnell tells James preparing him for the reality that life in prison will be all rape all the time and paving the way for the movies most objectionable scene. There are some schools of thought of course which might contend that nothing could be funnier than the sight of Will Ferrell falling to his knees in a toilet stall and getting slapped in the face with another dudes junk and they may well have a point. But what makes this particular sequence so noxious isnt just the familiar specter of gay panic which for better and for worse has become a pillar of American screen comedy. Its the coy cynical disgust with which the scene is framed featuring just enough genital exposure (it might have been spliced in by Tyler Durden) to presumably freak out the target audience without jeopardizing the R rating. The movie tries to strike a tolerant pose after the fact but its a weak ruse; frankly the virtual-reality sodomy in the recent ""Hot Tub Time Machine 2"" was handled in more enlightened fashion. Theres a similar crudeness to the recurring gag in which James stashes sharp objects up his rectum or the extended sequence in which Darnell gives James a crash course in prison-yard sociology which requires that Hart rattle off one thuggish ethnic impersonation after another. Still the movies racial humor is a bit harder to write off than its sexual politics even if the embarrassing blunders and the almost accidental insights seem to go hand-in-hand When James dresses up as Lil Wayne for a crucial protection meeting with Darnells gangleader cousin (charismatic rapper-actor Tip ""T.I."" Harris) youre not sure whether to nod approvingly at the critique of cultural misappropriation or to shake your head when a black guy mistakes a reference to ""Balzac"" for ""ball sac."" A setpiece in which our heroes wind up raiding a lair of white supremacists feels as pointless and toothless as the movies limp endgame in which Darnell and James go on a numbskull quest to prove the latters innocence. Whatever one makes of ""Get Hards"" contribution to our ongoing national debate about race class and sexuality theres no denying that too much of it simply feels cheap flailing and tired First-time feature director Cohen mostly leaves Ferrell and Hart to their rambunctious devices and they manage a vigorous affectionate chemistry that simply cries out for a smarter less objectionable vehicle.

Reply chris senkbeil says July 22 2015 at 907 am To say this movie is disparaging to anyone is obviously a statement made by a person who does not understand humor. Yes its definitely not as cerebral as a woody allen film but its not supposed to be this film is silly and just that. Politically correct humor is left for your 80 year old grandma and tyler perry. Reply Tom says May 20 2015 at 513 pm Justin Chang Chief Film Critic Wow you need a different job where is the actual review of the movie. This article is nothing but click bait. Get hard is not homophobic. It makes fun of a prison stereotype. Change the situation up a bit and you would see gay men react the same way to the thought of having forced relations with a women. And yes the racial humor is a bit over the top but again its only making fun of stereotypes. This is a comedy pure and simple if you cant understand what its doing you should not be the chief film critic. Reply JACK says April 25 2015 at 1204 am Lets drop the PC stuff and get real. Not being homophobic but for 90% of people gay activity is disgusting and repulsive so if a film portrays it that way I would have no problem with it. You cannot run from reality which is for most people it is a revolting activity. Im sorry but its the truth and I cant help being a heterosexual human being. Thats how normal heteros think. And Im black by the way. Blacks are the most anti gay race there is....google it Reply Mike says March 29 2015 at 425 pm So in the first sentence you accuse you readers of being homophobes. You suck. Reply Angus says March 27 2015 at 110 am Good Lord is there anything that doesnt offend you people? Grow some thicker skin. And get a box of tissues for your runny nose I just bought stock in Kleenex. Make me rich you cry-babies. Reply JACK says April 25 2015 at 1204 am i Know Reply Phillip Lake says March 24 2015 at 401 pm Will Ferrell is one of the biggest IDIOTS that has ever come out of Hollywood. He is living proof that you dont have to be any where near talented to be a Californication movie star; all he has is connections with the right (wrong) people. He is not humorous -- he is just plain STUPID You couldnt pay me his stinking non-deserved paycheck to sit through even one of his losing movies. Reply Michael Wlzien says March 19 2015 at 815 am looks hilarious stop whining Reply Bill B. says March 17 2015 at 1110 am My God this sounds terrible. Reply JJ says March 17 2015 at 1046 am Sounds like a dumb fake movie whose poster would have hung on Tracey Jordans wall in 30 Rock. Reply Reader says March 17 2015 at 929 am Another week another Hart movie. Is this dude not afraid of over-exposure? And Ferrell - still pushing the doofus shtick after all these years (even Steve Martin decided to grow up after his spell). These are generally 2 funny guys - but the trailers for this movie assailing my television have left me shaking my head. Reply GERON says March 17 2015 at 811 am SOUNDS LIKE A GARBAGE FILM SHOULD NOT EVEN BE RELEASED HOW CAN THOSE TWO ASSHOLE ACTORS ALLOW THEIR NAMES TO BE ATTACHED TO SUCH SHIT? Reply Travis says March 17 2015 at 804 am Why would they show this in Austin? Had to know it wouldnt go over well. Reply Steven Kovacs says March 17 2015 at 218 am Why didnt they just remake Trading Places instead of ripping it off? Reply Lucy says March 17 2015 at 656 am Quite sure this is not a ""Trading Places"" ripoff. This sounds funny. Reply Tripp Fell says March 17 2015 at 853 am Cripes its a ripoff of a ripoff And by ripoff I mean its the EXACT same movie as the film ""BIG STAN starring Rob Schneider that was released about 3 years ago.

The question is whether that baton is something anyone should have or want in the first place. The buddy comedy arrives freighted with accusations of racism and homophobia after its world premiere at SXSW last week with some decrying its recycling of racial stereotypes and gay panic -- staples of dude-driven farces since Ferrells breakthrough years on ""SNL."" But theres a daring comedy somewhere inside writer Etan Cohens (""Tropic Thunder"") directorial debut which simultaneously trivializes and solemnizes the prospect of prison rape. Staring down the barrel of a 10-year prison sentence for accounting shenanigans Ferrells Bel Air buffoon James hires his car washer Harts Darnell -- whos never been to prison but is more than willing to take this rich clowns money -- as his prison-prep instructor. See Video Kevin Hart Preps Will Ferrell for Prison in Get Hard Trailer (Video) For most of the film Cohen and his team of screenwriters create a comedy that doesnt punch down at victims but finds inspiration in James fear of sexual assault in the pen which may or may not be rooted in reality. (The millionaires only familiarity with clink life comes from violent dramas.) Its a premise that must recognize rapes true awfulness to work -- an acknowledgement that already renders most of ""Get Hard"" slightly more enlightened than the smug throwaway line about how convicts meet true justice when they drop the soap. Frightened as it is of hyper-masculine men Cohens comedy is really about making a man manlier. James is as soft as a down pillow when we first meet him crying his eyes out in an uncomfortable close-up. He wakes up doing yoga poses and fails to stand up to his grasping fiancee (Alison Brie) when she plans an addition to the blueprints of their already hulking manor. Also Read Dwayne Johnson-Kevin Hart Comedy Central Intelligence Gets Release Date James can make his boss/future father-in-law (Craig T. Nelson) 28 million in a day but seems to take no joy in sucking up money from the stock market; he simply looks constipated after a day at the office. With his wiry hair and untidily strewn teeth Ferrell fails to convince as a Reagan-worshipping Wall Street shark -- an emblem of the rarefied income bracket broadly satirized by the comedy in the first act. More satisfying are the ways ""Get Hard"" lampoons James racial assumptions. The sheltered investor is more than a little disappointed when he learns theres nothing especially ""black"" or thuggish about Darnells handshake. ""Oh regular"" he sighs. Darnell is no hunk of toughened meat himself but he goes along with James statistical ""deduction"" that hes been incarcerated -- one in three black men will serve time in jail the millionaire shrugs -- because hes eager to move his daughter out of their ""gangbanger school district"" in South Central. Part of the joke is that Darnell is so square hes called a ""Cliff Huxtable-looking motherf-cker"" by his criminal cousin Russell (rapper T.I.) but James cant tell the difference between this loving family man and Idi Amin. Given his own lack of knowledge about life on the inside Darnell cobbles together a haphazard readiness plan for his new client which is how James ends up in some hilarious scenarios bench-pressing his much shorter convict coach grudgingly starting fights with strangers for practice and pooping in a bucket in his own home which he turns into a mock prison run by his gleeful domestics. Also Read Kevin Hart Is Certain Justin Bieber Cried After Comedy Central Roast It Got a Little Rough (Video) Its also how Darnell brings James to a brunch bistro that doubles as a hook-up hangout in the films ickiest scene. Scared by his wifes (Edwina Findley Dickerson) warnings that James might not survive San Quentin Darnell convinces James to perform fellatio as a rehearsal for the real thing. In context it makes sense that the Ferrell would cringe and groan and squirm in front of a fake penis (worn by comedian Matt Walsh) -- this is one self-imposed indignity too many -- but in a larger cultural context of discomfort in comedy about male-on-male sexuality the scene can also be read as wincingly homophobic. With ""Get Hard"" Cohen repeatedly places himself and his performers on a tight rope between the fire and the frying pan. The comedy attempts to make us laugh at Ferrells one-percenter while sympathizing with his prison plight; to exploit James terror at the possibility of prison rape while keeping the tone pretty breezy; and to send up the millionaires stereotyping of black people while trafficking in those very same racial caricatures. (The third act finds Russell and his fellow gangsters meeting James whom they immediately dub ""Mayo."") Its a multiple balancing act that Cohen doesnt have the grace wit or sensitivity to pull off. Also Read Kevin Hart Slams Haters Defends His Marketing Skills Do We See the Level of Ignorance On top of all that theres a plodding investigation storyline to get through in which James discovers who framed him for the embezzlement that he didnt commit. (Its who youd suspect from the first 10 minutes of the movie.) Ferrell and Hart dont bring anything that we havent seen from them before but they create a bouncy playfully defiant rapport. Its promising enough that you wish they could have made a movie in which theyre just making us laugh instead of leaving us wondering how every third scene could be made less offensive.

"Review Get Hard is not for the sensitive - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Get Hard is not for the sensitiveBy Tony Hicksthicksbayareanewsgroup.comPosted 03/25/2015 120100 AM PDTUpdated 03/25/2015 052724 PM PDT ""Get Hard"" is not for the easily offended.Its not for people who dont like extreme cursing nor is it for those who cringe at lowbrow racial and sexual humor.And dont even ask about prison rape jokes. Right there are a lot of those. A LOT of those.So the question becomes Is ""Get Hard"" funny enough to get you through the cringing? Yes -- if you can suspend your sensitivity and accept that Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart are not only making fun of pretty much every racial group they can squeeze in theyre also making fun of the people who find this stuff funny.Bad taste aside the biggest problem with ""Get Hard"" is that it tells the same three or four jokes for 140 minutes. Its like the bad joke by your little brother that you laughed at once then had to listen to another 15 times. And some of the bits such as those that hinge on Ferrell being naked wear out quickly. If ""Get Hard"" were a 10-minute ""Funny or Die"" video it would be comedy gold -- immature lowest-common-denominator comedy gold. This is the kind of humor that should strike quick make you feel guilty for laughing and move on.Instead ""Get Hard"" seems to want to be another ""Trading Places"" that classic class-warfare comedy from 1983 but it falls well short.Advertisement Then again this is a Will Ferrell movie so you should know what youre getting into. Ferrell plays James King a big-time investment banker convicted of fraud who has 30 days before heading off to San Quentin for 10 years. Hart plays Darnell Lewis a decent man trying to get his family out of a bad neighborhood who also happens to wash Ferrells car. Falsely assuming Lewis has been in prison -- you know because dumb white people think all black men have been to prison -- King hires Lewis to prepare him for the big house.What follows is a parade of silliness that at times is funnier than it deserves to be. Ferrell plays essentially the same bumbling fish-out-of-water that he usually does. Only this time he has the screaming swearing Hart along as a sidekick and the pairing works pretty well given the material.Hart transforms the bankers mansion into a mock prison and one of the better bits is watching the bankers servants exact revenge for past treatment by playing Kings abusive fellow inmates. But most of the time Hart and Ferrell are busy milking stereotypes for everything theyre worth inmate jokes black jokes white jokes gay jokes and a couple of Latino and Jewish jokes squeezed in. Not surprisingly first-time director Etan Cohen (a co-writer of ""Tropic Thunder"") and the films six credited writers (including Ferrells ""Funny or Die"" partner Adam McKay) occasionally push the bad-taste envelope too far. And Im someone who can appreciate jokes aimed at 13-year-old boys. Particularly bad is a scene set at a brunch spot frequented by professional gay men. Darnell decides that James should just give up and learn to be an inmates er boy-toy (which is counter to the whole premise of the movie). What follows perpetuates some ugly and idiotic stereotypes about gay men. Unlike over-the-top scenes mocking the idea of black culture being based on ""Boyz n the Hood"" or featuring a crazed group of racist bikers (a rare scene that Hart steals from Ferrell) the restaurant scene is simply uncomfortable to watch. It should have been left on the cutting-room floor.The film hits its peak in what would be a shameful scene if it werent played to hyperbolic perfection by everyone involved. Yes I am referring to the controversial scene in which Darnell takes James to meet his cousin Russell (played by T.I.) and his gang-banging friends and James dresses for the occasion like he stepped straight out of an 80s episode of ""Yo MTV Raps.""""Get Hard"" is worth a look for fans of Ferrell and Hart. And the two do work well together. But anyone with a low tolerance for politically incorrect stereotyping and lowbrow humor should sit this one out. Then again they probably dont go to Will Ferrell movies anyway. (L-R) Kevin Hart as Darnell and Will Ferrell as James in Get Hard. (Patti Perret/Warner Bros. Pictures) ( Patti Perret/Warner Bros.
