"This Fox hunt is direct and effective - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW This Fox hunt is direct and effective By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  September 17 2004 Are there any casual viewers of Fox News? Partisans watch the Rupert Murdoch-owned channel because it reflects their conservative view of the world; for them it makes sense. Those on the left watch it to gnash their teeth. If there are uncommitted channel-surfers who come across Bill OReilly and company and swallow Fox News claim to be ""fair and balanced"" they really need to be directed to Robert Greenwalds ""Outfoxed Rupert Murdochs War on Journalism"" a hardly fair not especially balanced broadside that has the advantage of being correct.Greenwald is out to prove that ""fair and balanced"" is a canard -- that Fox News was created by Roger Ailes media adviser to Richard Nixon Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush for the express purpose of disseminating a take on the news that conservatives felt the ""liberal media"" ignored. This is shooting fish in a barrel Greenwald marshals damning in-house memos that lay out political marching orders such as ""striving for balance on Abu Ghraib."" He interviews former Fox correspondents and anonymous current employees all of whom testify to the pressure from upstairs to toe the Republican party line.Media eminence grises such as Walter Cronkite and Av Westin are brought on to tut-tut; pundits James Wolcott and Eric Alterman scoff at the ways in which Fox pushes hot-button topics such as gay marriage over the economy and the war in Iraq; former right-wing scold David Brock and left-wing jester Al Franken get their licks in. Still its the former employees who inflict the most damage. One-time anchor John du Pre recalls that ""Any [on-air] ad lib that made the Democrats look stupid and the Republicans look smart would get an `Attaboy and a wink and a smile.""""Outfoxed"" gets even more interesting when it deconstructs the techniques by which Fox News blurs the edges between news and opinion. The use of the words ""Some people say. . ."" becomes a Trojan horse to insert the Murdoch agenda into a newscast; Greenwald edits together a dizzying parade of anchors using the phrase. Character assassination is a stock in trade -- ask Richard Clarke -- as is the stacking of Brit Humes ""Special Report"" with 83 percent Republican interviewees versus 17 percent Democratic.Bill OReilly comes in for the worst treatment but lets face it you dont have to work overtime to make the host of ""The OReilly Factor"" look like a jackbooted media thug. Regardless of his political positions anyone who bullies interview subjects by repeatedly bawling ""Shut up"" is an embarrassment to the trade. By contrast Sean Hannity merely comes off as a smug toady and Geraldo as the craven opportunist weve known him as for decades.Where ""Outfoxed"" falls short is in burrowing into the reasons why Fox News exists and why its such a success (it got the highest ratings of any network during last months Republican Convention a case perhaps of preaching to the choir but still -- thats a big choir). To do so Greenwald would have to acknowledge what no one at Fox would ever admit that the logo ""fair and balanced"" was never meant as a credo but rather as a cynical swipe at the perceived biases of the other networks and mainstream press. Want to call us on journalistic impartiality? Fox asks every time that phrase is invoked. Look to yourself first.Maybe someday someone will make a documentary that truly investigates bias in news-gathering -- conscious and unconscious; from right left and center. Such a film would have to address whether reportage can ever be free of opinion (short answer no) and it would also have to acknowledge that the so-called ""liberal media"" is too compromised by corporate restraints and institutional timidity to be anywhere near as activist as its detractors claim. For the time being though Greenwald has fashioned a fine attack dog and hes sicced it on a deserving subject.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.Outfoxed Rupert Murdochs War on JournalismDirected by Robert GreenwaldStarring Bill OReilly Brit Hume David Brock Walter CronkiteAt Coolidge CornerRunning time 78 minutesUnrated (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

It might try claiming permanent ownership to the words ""shut up"" since Bill OReilly says it so often in his line of work. ""Outfoxed Robert Murdochs War on Journalism"" a left-wing filmmakers attempt to call foul on megamedia owner Murdochs exclamation-point news network showcases OReilly at his inimitable finest as well as other Fox journalists like Brit Hume and Sean Hannity. ""Shut up"" says OReilly as soon as his interviewee offers an opposing viewpoint. Rupert Murdoch and his Fox News Channel are examined in ""Outfoxed."" (Carolina Productions) _____More in Movies_____  Outfoxed Showtimes and Details  Summer Movie Guide  Arts amp; Living Movies _____Free E-mail Newsletters_____  News Headlines  News Alert ""Shut up"" he says to another who dares to do the same. And again. And again. What ""Outfoxed"" clearly wants to show viewers -- and it would take an act of political will or sheer goofiness to dispute this -- is Foxs conservative agenda. But more than that filmmaker Robert Greenwald also the director of ""Uncovered The Whole Truth About the Iraq War"" wants to take issue with the ""fair and balanced"" claim. ""There was further evidence today that President Bushs days of absorbing John Kerrys attacks without counterattacks are over"" begins Brit Hume in one Fox broadcast. Fair? Balanced? You decide. Theres more. But thats for this clearly partisan film to tell you. Perhaps only the pre-converted will attend this movie. But for independent thinkers and those who think of journalism as a profession of accuracy fairness and ethics theres more than enough to chew on. Clearly from the angry liberal camp Greenwald rolls out an army of left-leaning pundits including The Nation columnist Eric Alterman self-professed ex-conservative David Brock comedian-commentator Al Franken Rep. Bernard Sanders (I-Vt.) cultural critic James Wolcott and Peter Hart author of ""The Oh Really? Factor Unspinning Fox News Channels Bill OReilly."" But more compellingly he interviews more politically balanced observers such as widely respected former CBS anchor Walter Cronkite whos hardly laudatory and many former members of Fox News locally and national who speak candidly about the regular in-house edicts that told them how to politically portray their news broadcasts. Some speak of harsh reprisals and measures taken to ensure the field reporters were toeing the party line. One former Fox reporter -- assigned to cover the anticipated crowds at Ronald Reagans presidential library on his birthday -- says he was suspended for airing footage that showed the meager turnout. This kind of firsthand detailed testimony even in the context of a liberally biased film is not easy to dismiss as propaganda or the lamentations of the fired and disgruntled. Theres too much detail and too many similarities in the complaints. If theres one scene that ranks as the most emotionally telling it is surely OReillys contentious interview with Jeremy Glick whose father was among those killed in the attacks of Sept. 11 2001. Haranguing Glick for signing an antiwar petition and opposing Bushs war policies he emotionally accuses the young man of everything from treason to defamation of the president. When Glick continues to disagree OReilly tells a technician to cut off Glicks microphone before ordering him out of the building. This is where viewer emotion is likely to run high on either side of the political fence. And its likely to be the defining point in the movie for everyone watching.

Joining ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" ""Control Room"" ""The Hunting of the President"" ""Orwell Rolls in His Grave"" and ""The Corporation"" the new documentary ""Outfoxed Rupert Murdochs War on Journalism"" sends up one more heated cry during an already hot and bothered political season. The film by Robert Greenwald seeks to deconstruct the methods (and occasional madness) of Fox News Channel which he sees not as ""Fair and Balanced"" -- as the networks catch phrase has it -- but as radically partisan. To bolster his claims Greenwald has enlisted several former Fox employees as well as volunteers who monitored the cable channels news reports for political bias. _____More in Movies_____  Outfoxed Showtimes and Details  Summer Movie Guide  Arts amp; Living Movies _____Free E-mail Newsletters_____  News Headlines  News Alert Using interviews internal memos and outtakes ""Outfoxed"" paints an often grave but sometimes hilarious picture of a hugely powerful network owned and run by men (Rupert Murdoch and CEO Roger Ailes to be exact) with unmistakable right-wing agendas. Along the way the film argues they routinely repackage Bush administration talking points with snazzy graphics and pumped-up volume and present them as objective news. (""Outfoxed"" came out on DVD two weeks ago and is being shown in theaters in part to build on the success of that release.) Often Greenwalds argument is convincing especially when hes talking to former Fox News workers and when he shows political reporter Carl Cameron cozying up to candidate George W. Bush (Camerons wife worked on the Bush campaign) before doing a disclosure-free interview. And theres something particularly depressing about Walter Cronkite bemoaning the state of Foxs journalism. Its as if Captain Kangaroo were breaking the news that somebodys been putting crack cocaine in the Cocoa Puffs. When Walter is unhappy clearly somethings gone horribly horribly wrong. But Greenwald undermines his own mission when he mixes apples and oranges the very sin he accuses Fox of committing. Its no surprise that Bill OReilly can be a rude and belligerent host -- here amply demonstrated by his appalling treatment of a young man whose father died on Sept. 11 2001 -- but OReilly along with another ""Outfoxed"" target Sean Hannity is a commentator not a news gatherer. Throughout Greenwalds film news and commentary programs are conflated with the ultimate effect being confusing and well somewhat Foxlike. Whats more while ""Outfoxed"" addresses Foxs influence on other channels and programs the subject is given short shrift. With their reliance on tabloid sensationalism zap-edits in-your-face graphics and sanctimonious displays of patriotism too many broadcast and cable news outlets are adopting Foxs excesses. Rather than Murdoch and Co. the title of ""Outfoxed"" could refer just as easily to the way the mainstream media continually seek to up Foxs ante in lowering the denominator. Outfoxed Rupert Murdochs War onJournalism (77 minutes at the Avalon) is not rated.

Rupert Murdocks war on journalism. Handout/Carolina Productions DOCS06002_HO.jpg.TIF ""Outfoxed."" Rupert Murdocks war on journalism. Handout/Carolina Productions Photo Handout Crooked angles in sly Fox expose 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Outfoxed Rupert Murdochs War on Journalism Documentary. Directed by Robert Greenwald. (Not rated. 78 minutes. At the Roxie Cinema.) That Fox News funnels its reporting through a right-wing prism isnt exactly privileged information so the idea of an expose about Fox News seems at first superfluous -- an expose of something that nobodys hiding. But ""Outfoxed"" a documentary about the cable news channel brings to light information not widely known some of it capable of astonishing even the already cynical. Directed by Robert Greenwald ""Outfoxed"" is a documentary obviously made on the cheap. Consisting almost entirely of interviews (Al Franken James Wolcott and others) and of excerpts from Fox News it seems as if it were recorded on a camcorder and narrated by a guy sitting in his kitchen with a microphone. That doesnt negate its effectiveness however. Think of it as the cinematic equivalent of a pamphlet printed in somebodys basement. No one wants to be handed a pamphlet. But sometimes you take one anyway get on the bus and read the whole thing. And afterward you think ""Hmm. Interesting."" ""Outfoxed"" is like that. The movie answers a naive question that Ive always had about Fox How is the political point of view enforced? Do they hire only conservatives and how do they know if these hires really are conservative? Couldnt they just pretend to be conservative until theyre in power like Supreme Court nominees? Of course this line of questioning is naive because it assumes that at Fox as in every other news organization the reporting comes from the bottom up; that is that reporters and editors find the stories and that the stories find placement on the basis of their news value. Instead according to ""Outfoxed"" the policy at Fox News comes from the top down. Daily memos come from the corporate office telling the reporters and news personalities what the story of the day will be. These directives include not only the days subject but the point of view expected to be taken in reporting it. One day the assignment will be to portray Kerry as a ""flip- flopper."" The next to talk about how Iraqis never had it better. The next to try to portray Kerry as looking French. Ideas favorable to Foxs slant are introduced by the words ""some say."" In journalism those words can be fairly used to protect unnamed sources. On Fox as Greenwald shows theyre used to inject opinion and spin under cover of reporting an existing phenomenon ""Some say Kerry looks French."" The grip that Fox exerts on its staff is illustrated by the case of John DuPre a reporter assigned to cover the 90th birthday festivities at the Ronald Reagan presidential library three years ago. There were no festivities. There was barely anyone there all day except for a school class tour. DuPre tried to tell his bosses there was no story but they told him to come up with one. He did. (""Theyve been arriving since dawn"" he eventually said in his report -- probably referring to himself and his crew.) But he was suspended anyway. In another case a reporter was reassigned during the 2000 Florida recount for strenuously questioning George W. Bushs representative Jim Baker during a televised news conference. Other reporters dont have to be kept in line. Carl Cameron Foxs chief political reporter is shown shyly fawning and simpering over an exhausted Bush in 2000 minutes before an interview. The conversation? It concerned Camerons wife who at the time was working for the Bush campaign. ""Shes a good soul"" Bush sighs. Then the interview begins. Theres extensive footage of talk show personality Bill OReilly including a shocking scene of him berating Jeremy Glick a young leftist whose father was killed in the World Trade Center bombing. Then again OReilly is known for this behavior. More unsettling in a way is the footage of Brit Hume. After updating the American death toll in Iraq at 277 he points out that a soldier in Iraq has about as much chance of dying there than any random Californian has of getting murdered. Thats whats called putting things in perspective. The movies most damning revelation is in the form of a poll revealing that regular watchers of Fox come away with gross misconceptions about current events. They watch the news and get a distorted impression of the world. -- Advisory This film contains strong language.

"Documentaries take on the right-wing media conspiracy. Slate Sign In Sign Up Documentaries take on the right-wing media conspiracy. Documentaries take on the right-wing media conspiracy. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.July 28 2004 706 PM They Distort We Deride A pair of pugnacious documentaries takes on the right-wing propaganda machine. By David Edelstein Open season In the wake of Fahrenheit 9/11 (which has crossed the 100 million mark in U.S. ticket sales) a couple of pugnacious documentaries remind us why Michael Moore--whatever we might think of his bullying techniques and less than attractive personality--is a necessary and maybe even heroic counterforce. The Hunting of the President (Regent Releasing) and Outfoxed (The Disinformation Co.) are portraits of a right-wing propaganda machine with a magnificent record of accomplishment tying up moderate Democratic administrations with spurious investigations; portraying moderate Democrats as radical tax-and-spend flip-floppers; and perpetuating the myth that the media is controlled by liberals and/or socialists while parroting under the guise of fairness and balance a prodigious list of deceptions. These documentaries are neither fair nor balanced They are counterprosecutions and as such they are spectacularly effective. For one thing they demonstrate that as liars go Michael Moore is a piker. Its a popular misconception that in Fahrenheit 9/11 he spins an elaborate conspiracy theory involving George W. Bush the Saudis and Sept. 11. The truth is that Moore mostly throws a lot of suspicious stuff out there and leaves the viewer to connect the dots (or in some cases admittedly to fantasize liberally). The Hunting of the President based on a book by Joe Conason and Gene Lyons with the subtitle The Ten-Year Campaign to Destroy Bill and Hillary Clinton shows how much more effective the right has been at transforming baseless innuendo into the stuff of 80-million taxpayer-funded investigations--and impeachments. Even though Id read that book (as well as Jeffrey Toobins A VastConspiracy) the movie was like a punch to the gut. How could Americans--of both parties--have let that happen? Advertisement A simple chronological history narrated with melancholy gravitas by Morgan Freeman The Hunting of the President is TheBlair Witch Project for Democrats--and for that matter democrats. Directed by Nikolas Perry and Clintons big buddy Harry Thomason the movie doesnt trace a vast right-wing conspiracy--only a relentless multi-tentacled one. The documentary begins ham-handedly with Moore-like cheap shots (interpolations of old movies for yucks) and horror-movie music. It picks up speed when the parade of Little Rock Ahabs appears in footage from the 80s and 90s spurned office-holder Larry Nichols Little Rock detective Larry Case lawyer (and resentful Clinton Oxford classmate) Cliff Jackson Parker Dozier Everett Hamm David Hale--scaaary kids. But the narrative really doesnt take off until Whitewater independent counsel Robert B. Fiske seemingly on the brink of exonerating Bill and Hillary Clinton is replaced by Jesse Helms-sponsored Judge David Sentelle with an ambitious and fiercely partisan Republican Kenneth W. Starr. Thats when there should be horror-movie music. Scariest are the familiar shots of Starr taking out the trash Such a mild-mannered trash-taker-outer just doing his job His legal team meanwhile is using police-state tactics to turn the screws on some vulnerable people. Chief among them is the bipolar cock-up Jim McDougall who had badly mismanaged the Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan and the movie suggests is desperate to reclaim some dignity. The Hunting of the President gives us a new culture hero in Susan McDougall who recounts her refusal to accept the script that Starrs team has written for her (convinced she is in love with the president they order her to finger the first lady) and her subsequent years in a maximum security prison on a floor populated by women who have killed their children. McDougall describes wearing a red dress which instantly pegs her as a child killer prompting inmates on buses to and from the courthouse to urinate and masturbate in front of the cage in which she was kept--a striking complement to our image of that other dress the blue one. Behind the scenes the movie reminds us Starrs future benefactor Richard Mellon Scaife bankrolls such costly operations as the Arkansas Project--which takes its cues from Jerry Falwells video The Clinton Chronicles in which the commander in chief is portrayed as a drug smuggler embezzler coke-head money-launderer murderer and all-around enemy of God. It would all have led nowhere ... but then of course Starr found Clintons Achilles heel. The Hunting of the President isnt large-spirited enough to give any of the credible Clinton critics a mouthpiece. (The press conferences of Paula Jones and her handler anti-abortion activist and two-time abortion recipient Susan Carpenter-McMillan dont count.) The movie lets stand the assertion of Sidney Blumenthal that the presidents enemies were simply driven mad by his pragmatic conciliatory nature and it suggests that other foes (Starr among them) were consumed by something like sexual jealousy. The film does not give even grudging recognition to the possibility that Clinton was not only a compulsive womanizer but on occasion a sexual predator. Advertisement Im not sure that letting the other side make its case would weaken the movies thrust The bottom line is that an 80-million investigation turned up nothing but evidence of consensual oral sex and Clinton left office as the most popular president of our time. Popular ... and impeached ... and hobbled ... and unable to get his successor elected despite eight years of peace and prosperity. The most chilling thing about The Hunting ofthe President is that all in all that was some good huntin. While The Hunting of the President makes its determined way across the country in a limited release Outfoxed is flooding the mailboxes of liberals everywhere as a 78-minute DVD. Written and directed by Robert Greenwald (in affiliation with MoveOn and the Center for American Progress) its mostly talking heads and for the first 15 minutes--when those heads speak abstractly of corporations monopolizing the delivery of our news--not much of a movie. But when those talking heads metamorphose into familiar ranting heads it becomes another mesmerizing right-wing horror show. This is the story of the Fox News Network--or as some people say the Faux News Network. Some people say that the network that employs such slogans as ""fair and balanced"" and ""We report. You decide"" is the most flagrant propaganda organ in the history of American television. Oops that ""some people say"" is one of Foxs patented techniques a trick to introduce the networks opinion under the guise of an objective observation. (""Some people say Kerry is Jane Fonda with a Burberry scarf around his neck"" etc.) Greenwald gives us a terrific montage of our fair and balanced hosts using the ""some people say"" trope to advance the Republican talking point of the day via since-published memos by John Moody or commands from on high by former (some people say current) Republican operative Roger Ailes. Heres another montage ""Some people say John Kerry looks French ..."" ""French ..."" ""French ..."" ""effectively makes Kerry French ..."" Sometimes I suspect that ""fair and balanced"" thing wasnt coined to deceive viewers so much as to wave a red cape in front of liberals. It works Snort snort. But it really is the most unholy sort of chutzpah for Ailes to minimize his ties to the Republican Party and claim that Fox is ""restoring objectivity."" Greenwald doesnt even need the commentators smart as they are Al Franken James Wolcott Eric Alterman Bob McChesney Rep. Bernie Sanders. He doesnt even need the former Fox employees like John DuPre who says he was reamed out and suspended for not making an uneventful birthday at the Ronald Reagan library look like a spontaneous outpouring of mass love with patriots dropping to their knees in prayer. He could build the whole movie out of clips like the one in which correspondent Carl Cameron talks fondly with George W. Bush about Camerons wife who works for Bushs campaign. (This precedes the fawning interview seen by Fox viewers.) He could build the whole movie out of Sean Hannity and Bill OReilly. When OReilly invites Jeremy Glick--son of a Port Authority worker who died on Sept. 11--onto his program and then screams at him to shut up orders his mike cut and tells his security guards to get the man out of his studio before he tears him to pieces its a mighty moment in the annals of psychopathology. ""He came on this program and accused President Bush of knowing about 9/11 and murdering his father"" OReilly rants delusionally. Glick had said in effect that Bush was a proponent of American exceptionalism one of the ideas that provoked the attack that killed his father. A debatable notion but not if youre debating OReilly--who says he considers Americans who express ideas that ""work against our military once war is underway"" to be ""enemies of the state."" This is of course the language of authoritarianism of both the right and the left. And thats the problem with Fox that its propaganda is used in the service of shutting down dialogue. Say what you will about Air America (I find it entertaining in small doses) the commentators marshal facts to make their points and can argue with opponents without cutting their mikes and booting them from the studio. The problem with Fox viewers is not that theyre Republican its that their outrage against the ""liberal elite"" is roughly proportional to their crazy ignorance. Greenwald shares the astonishing statistic that 67 percent of Fox viewers in October 2003 believed that the United States had found links between Iraq and al-Qaida and that more than one-third believed that world opinion favored the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Outfoxed ends with more talking heads on the subject of corporate control of the news media. Good luck prying stations away from Rupert Murdoch I say. In the meantime lets continue to hold up the ""fair and balanced"" to ridicule on and off Fox News. Lets not let Tucker Carlson (on PBS) attribute John Edwards success as a trial lawyer to ""Jacuzzi cases""--meaning the young girl who was disemboweled by a faulty pump and will spend the rest of her life attached to machines. And next time you hear someone say ""John Kerry looks French"" you can reply ""He does kind of. And that George W.--he looks Saudi Arabian"" SINGLE PAGE 1 2 NEXT Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1. Clinton Takes the Lead in First Post-DNC Poll 2. Khizr M.

Presenting a repetitive yet cohesive examination of the cable news net as an propagandist for the Republican cause this doc makes persuasive points about media manipulation political bias and smear-campaign tactics. What Michael Moore did to the Bush administration in ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" producer-director Robert Greenwald does to Fox News in ""Outfoxed Rupert Murdochs War on Journalism."" Presenting an often repetitive yet generally cohesive examination of the cable news net as an unapologetic propagandist for the Republican cause this op-ed doc makes persuasive points about media manipulation political bias and smear-campaign tactics. Distributed on DVD through the Disinformation Web site the film lacks the accompanying media spotlight that boosted the Moore release and therefore appears unlikely to reach beyond a liberal audience with an already vehement aversion to Fox News partisan coverage. Greenwalds guerrilla filmmaking methods have enabled him to assemble timely docs like ""Uncovered The Whole Truth About the Iraq War"" which was promoted and released through alternative avenues involving political orgs such as MoveOn.org a backer of this project. Any moves by Fox to discredit this highly damaging doc ultimately may bolster the filmmakers success in gaining exposure. Touching on subjects as current as the John Kerry presidential campaign or the 9/11 commission hearings the film clearly came together in haste reflected to an extent in its pedestrian structure. Notably the opening and closing provide less than forceful bookends for the stream of more cogent information in between. Some direct dialogue with Fox News and greater comparison with other nets coverage also would have made the film more compelling. One of the main characters who seems to require little outside help in his demonization is Bill OReilly host of Fox News ""The OReilly Factor."" Arguably the only time Greenwald comes close to the visceral kick of indignation fostered by watching ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is in the extended section covering a guest appearance on OReillys show of Jeremy Glick an opponent of the war in Iraq whose father died in the Twin Towers attack. OReillys handling of his guest -- even invoking Glicks dead father and widowed mother against him -- and his follow-up to distort and discredit his guests views the next day will be shocking to viewers uninitiated in the right-wing hosts abusive style. But while OReilly represents the extreme -- the rightist yin to Moores leftist yang -- Greenwald illustrates that Fox News systematically functions as a Republican lobbying group. The filmmaker uses amusing rapid-fire montages to make a mockery of such claims as ""We Report You Decide"" and ""Fair and Balanced"" (the nets slogans). Doc also claims the network has fostered an operating style -- now being imitated by its competitors -- in which cable newsrooms are being downsized as opinionists take precedence over newsgathering and reporting. Fact that this approach is more cost-effective seems not insignificant. That those opinionists show a relentless bias to the right and a tendency toward negative caricaturing of liberals and Democrats appears to represent no problem for Fox -- a fact backed by internal memos and interviews with media analysts and former Fox News producers and contributors. Some are used anonymously with voice distortion to protect future employment prospects as they describe a ""Stalinist monitoring system"" under which any line other than the White House line secures a swift company exit. A few more critics like former Fox News reporter Jon Du Pre might have further reinforced the films point. Much has been documented in European media about the political bias and lack of journalistic integrity in coverage on Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconis three commercial networks and since his election to office on the pubcaster he now indirectly controls. However criticism of Murdochs 4.7 billion worldwide audience reach has been more confined to op-ed pages and forums like Jon Stewarts ""The Daily Show."" Given that Greenwalds film provides stimulating evidence of how thoroughly news can be skewed political agendas served and a climate of fear created by a news net selling itself as an objective information service but in reality offering little distinction between news and commentary.
