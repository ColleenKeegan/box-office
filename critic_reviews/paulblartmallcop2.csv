"Review Paul Blart Mall Cop 2 might work if it was actually funny - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Paul Blart Mall Cop 2 might work if it was actually funny Kevin James Matt Kennedy / Sony Pictures Kevin James in a scene from ""Paul Blart Mall Cop 2."" Kevin James in a scene from ""Paul Blart Mall Cop 2."" (Matt Kennedy / Sony Pictures) Gary Goldstein Review Paul Blart Mall Cop 2 might work if it was actually funny You can take the cop out of the mall but you cant take the mall out of the cop. Or so says ""Paul Blart Mall Cop 2"" the noisy scattershot if energetic follow-up to the 2009 hit starring hefty jokester Kevin James. Although there have been worse sequels -- and worse overall movies -- make no mistake thats hardly a recommendation.For the uninitiated New Jersey security maven Blart is as one character here affectionately dubs him ""a strange misshapen superhero."" Hes also such a whirling dervish of delusional dopiness that its tough to buy into those rare moments when the big guy actually has a cogent thought. To justify the Blart concoction (James and Nick Bakay cowrote both films) as simply an outsized vessel for maximum comic effect might fly if he was actually funny. But at least in ""Cop 2"" Blart for all his plus-size pratfalls and cartoonish reactions proves the films least humorous element. To wit ""Saturday Night Live"" alum Ana Gasteyer elicits more laughs in her handful of scenes as another security guards game wife than James does in the entire movie.The films hyper-silly but workable plot finds a now down-on-his luck Blart -- his mother (a fleeting Shirley Knight) was run over by a milk truck and his wife (Jayma Mays) left him after six days of marital blech -- attending a security officers convention at the Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas. He brings along his devoted UCLA-bound daughter Maya (an endearing Raini Rodriguez) who attempts some tame fun despite her wildly overprotective dad. In trademark bull-in-a-china-shop form Blart wreaks havoc on everyone and everything he encounters in and around the Wynn in instantly telegraphed ways. (You know the second he comes face to face with a huge exotic bird the results wont be pretty.) Isnt it bad enough he dresses like the worlds most obnoxious tourist?

See more videos Meanwhile an ""Oceans Eleven""-type art heist is conveniently underway at the Wynn at the very same time. The elaborate scheme masterminded by icy ringleader Vincent (Neal McDonough) eludes the hotels allegedly crack security chief (Eduardo Verastegui) and comely general manager (Daniella Alonso) and only gets Blarts attention when Maya becomes embroiled in the mayhem.Still Blart with the help of a ragtag band of fellow conventioneers will eventually face off against Vincent and his high-powered crew in a believe-it-or-not showdown. Suffice to say editing and sound effects go a long way here to sell this frantic bone-crunching battle.

But as is so often the case with big star-driven studio laffers ""Cop 2"" needed several more spins in the comedy punch-up machine before cameras rolled. -------------------------------""Paul Blart Mall Cop 2""MPAA Rating PG for some violence.Running time 1 hour 34 minutes.Playing In general release.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Spoofing the Die Hard formula with a portly mall cop in the Bruce Willis role may not be a lofty idea but it seems simple enough especially considering the number of mostly non-comedic imitators Die Hard has spawned over the years. Yet its taken Paul Blart two whole feature films to fail at this task. Both movies deck out their opening titles in a shiny gold logo and faux-serious score--then instead of undercutting the seriousness with jokes immediately put any and all spoofery on hold while painstakingly establishing and re-establishing hypoglycemic security officer Paul Blart (Kevin James) as a sympathetic underdog.The most surprising thing about this process is how sad it is even after Blarts first-movie triumph of defending his mall against a gang of skateboarding assailants. The original Blart opened six years ago just months before Jody Hills pitch-black Observe And Report and while the tonal and technical differences between the two are vast theyre surprisingly similar in their indexing of lifes cruelties. If anything Paul Blart Mall Cop 2 ups that sadness quotient spending much of its opening proving that just because these movies are stupider than Observe And Report doesnt mean they have to be less cripplingly depressing. Rather than writing off Blarts tentative relationship with his love interest from the last movie it shows them marrying and Blart getting served with regretful divorce papers six days later; rather than having Blarts mother pass away peacefully offscreen the filmmakers show her getting killed by a milk truck. The movie adds to this darkness a layer of hangdog self-pity thats supposed to be endearing but it actually makes Blart funnier and more recognizably human.Depressed by his inarguably tragic life Blart takes his teenage daughter Maya (Raini Rodriguez) on a trip to a security convention in Las Vegas. From there the Wynn resort in Las Vegas essentially functions as the airport in Die Hard 2 a bigger location for a reprisal of the first films formula. And sure enough just like its predecessor Mall Cop 2 takes its sweet time putting Blart into conflict with a bunch of armed thugs. Before he can run afoul of art thief Vincent (Neal McDonough perfectly cast as a poor mans Die Hard villain) Blart must express his dismay that his nearly adult daughter would do anything on her own. He also spends a lot of time mistakenly rebuffing the non-advances of hotel manager Divina (Daniella Alonso)--who then inexplicably finds herself drawn to him. This means that Paul Blart Mall Cop 2 has a subplot constructed around the pick-up artist concept of ""negging."" Theres also a creepy scene where Blart convinces a stranger she should be happy that one of his colleagues has drunkenly hit on her. Despite this tedium and occasional creepiness the sequel generates more laughs than the original which couldnt even muster appropriate levels of zaniness. Here there are a few moments where James shakes off his muttering and yelling routine--dialogue-based humor isnt really his strong suit but he has a pretty funny verbal confrontation with an underplaying McDonough. A few of the security expo details are amusing like how it gathers groups of good-natured portly fellows in short-sleeved button-down shirts who talk about whether they have a go-to ""belt guy."" James also looks like a potentially decent physical comedian--though in the hands of director Andy Fickman few of his pratfalls and sight gags make any visual sense. Like a lot of CG-assisted slapstick they mostly depend on something physically impossible happening instead of unlikely elements snapping into place.That fits in with the movies general aesthetic of low-budget indifference. Though the movie was clearly filmed on location at the Wynn (not passing up free vacations being the driving ethos of Adam Sandlers Happy Madison Productions which made both Mall Cops) the digital cinematography gives the over-lit Vegas environment a home-video texture. Scenes as simple as two groups of people standing in a hotel suite (or is it a hallway? The movies geography is muddled) look green-screened whether they were or not. The opening credits and one shutter-adjusted fight scene are the only tenuous connections the movie forges with its obvious action-movie inspirations. Then again maybe Paul Blart isnt spoofing John McClane after all; maybe these movies are actually too stupid to realize what theyre imitating.

Photo Credit Sony Pictures / Matt Kennedy advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The Segway-riding law enforcer returns this time to foil a heist in Las Vegas. Rated PG (some mature humor). BOTTOM LINE Not awful but not great. James big-hearted persona keeps things tolerable. CAST Kevin James Neal McDonough Raini Rodriguez LENGTH 134 You can say what you want about the 2009 comedy ""Paul Blart Mall Cop"" and many critics did upon its release. Starring Stony Brooks Kevin James as a police academy washout trying to retain his dignity as a New Jersey mall security guard the film nevertheless became a 183 million hit. There were reasons for that It was fairly wholesome and very all-American with the likable James playing a dedicated working man and loving father to his half-Latina daughter Maya (Raini Rodriguez). The movie was not laugh-out-loud funny and neither is the sequel ""Paul Blart Mall Cop 2."" Set in Las Vegas and centered on an art heist at Steve Wynns eponymous and prominently branded hotel its a repeat of the original in every way from the slim plot (James wrote with Nick Bakay) to the low-energy slapstick (director Andy Fickman replaces Steve Carr). What makes it tolerable is Jamess big-hearted Blart and an overall spirit of goodwill. advertisement | advertise on newsday There are a few chuckles. Blart continues to insist that hes a real ""officer"" a delusion that actually works in his favor when a gorgeous hotel manager (Daniella Alonso) becomes helplessly attracted to his confident masculinity. At a security trade convention Blart samples various pathetically harmless weapons including a feeble Taser whose effects last a mere five seconds; the gizmo ends up providing one of the films funnier routines. Veteran character actors Nicholas Turturro Gary Valentine and Loni Love play Barts motley comrades. More movie reviewsLatest movie reviews A welcome presence is Neal McDonough (HBOs ""Band of Brothers"" FXs ""Justified""). He gamely spoofs his ramrod persona in the role of Vincent a criminal mastermind with a severe oatmeal allergy. Watching McDonough and James try to out-crazy each other with absurd threats (""I will pour maple syrup all over your face"") is a minor highlight. More notable are the jokes the movie doesnt make. There are none about poop or body-parts there are no ethnic slurs or homophobic humor and Blarts heavyset daughter is never mocked or taunted. All of that ought to count for something. ""Paul Blart Mall Cop 2"" may be forgettable but its difficult to truly dislike.

But whos going to speak out against the flagrant and wanton misuse of talented comedians in ""Paul Blart Mall Cop 2?"" Ive given up hope on Kevin James who long ago made a devils bargain with the soul-crushing destroyers of cinema at Adam Sandlers Happy Madison shingle but why did he have to drag down Ana Gasteyer and Loni Love two exceptionally funny women wasted here in nothing roles and shaming wigs? And how could Nick Bakay whose extensive resume includes Joel Hodgsons innovative and hilarious ""The TV Wheel"" share a screenplay credit (with James of course) on a movie whose chuckles (six I counted) are outnumbered by helicopter shots of the Wynn resort in Las Vegas? See video Kevin James Tackles Sin City in Paul Blart Mall Cop 2 Trailer (Video) (Incidentally having sat through ""The Hangover"" ""Last Vegas"" ""21"" ""Think Like a Man Too"" and more Vegas movies than I care to count I hereby challenge filmmakers to create an establishing shot of the citys skyline that doesnt look like it was distributed to every production by the Convention amp; Visitors Authority.) Paul Blart -- imagine Inspector Clouseau only husky not French and not funny -- tells us in the opening narration that the triumphs of the previous movie were short-lived; his wife left him after six days of marriage and his beloved mother was soon thereafter hit by a milk truck. (Actresses Jayma Mays and Shirley Knight had the good sense to flee this movie in the first five minutes a strategy audience members would be wise to emulate.) His spirits are lifted by an invitation to Las Vegas for a convention of security officers and he sets out to Sin City with daughter Maya (Raini Rodriguez ""Austin amp; Ally"") in tow. After all the personal losses her dad has suffered shes hesitant to tell him that she just got into UCLA all the way across the country from their home in New Jersey. Also Read Unfriended Scares Up 656000 Paul Blart 2 Rolls to 450000 at Thursday Night Box Office Unbeknownst to the blustery bumbling Blart the Wynn hotel where the convention is happening is also hosting Vincent (Neal McDonough sleepwalking through yet another bad-guy role) who is planning to steal the casinos art treasures including van Goghs ""Sunflowers."" These two storylines plus some interplay with Blarts fellow rent-a-cops all of whom are condescendingly portrayed for maximum freakishness somehow fill up 94 minutes at the hand of director Andy Fickman who previously anointed the world with ""Parental Guidance"" and ""You Again."" Also Read Kevin James and Paul Blart Hope Furious 7 Runs Out of Gas at Box Office The closest ""Paul Blart 2"" gets to actual comedy is in its use of James (and some strategic stunt doubles) somersaulting and flipping around despite his apparent ungainliness but even that joke gets trotted out so often that it loses whatever impact it might have had. I watched the film with a paying opening-night audience (Sony was happy to slap its name on almost every cell phone and watch featured in the movie but they didnt want to share this film with critics in advance) and the place was mostly silent as a tomb save for the featured-in-the-trailer gag in which Blart runs smack into a plate glass window. The humor level in the film is so moribund that it doesnt even inspire groans or eye-rolling; instead it figuratively puts its hands on your shoulders and pushes you deeper into your theater seat until youve been completely subdued by all the nothingness it has to offer. Cinematically speaking its like having a riot squad beanbag shot directly at your solar plexus. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Watch in Times Video >> embed You wont find much offensive in Kevin Jamess slick innocuous vehicle ""Paul Blart Mall Cop 2."" You wont find much prompting an emotional reaction in general so familiar are the jokes and situations. If Mr. Jamess character thinks of safety first so does this movie to its extreme detriment.The pride of the West Orange Pavilion Mall in New Jersey Blart returning from the 2009 original is a mustachioed huffy-puffy bundle of ego and sanctimony who at the start of ""Mall Cop 2"" has had bad luck His wife left him after six days of marriage and his mother has been killed by a milk truck. Only an invitation to a security guard convention in Las Vegas for which he mistakenly believes he will give the keynote speech lifts his spirits. In tow is his daughter Maya (Raini Rodriguez back from the first) who meets a quasi-love interest Lane (David Henrie) at the hotel and casino where she and her father are staying. Photo Kevin James as Paul Blart on his wheels of choice. Credit Matt Kennedy/Columbia Pictures At the convention Blart is introduced James Bond-style to nonlethal gadgets he will use later one that spits marbles; another that fires beanbags; a glue gun. There are also Segways Blarts preferred mode of travel that he activates ""MacGyver""-style with improvised materials.After the scheduled convention speaker gets too drunk to do the job Blart steps in and his colleagues erupt with cheers at his oratory. (The script was written by Mr. James and Nick Bakay). Even the comely Divina Martinez (Daniella Alonso) the hotel-casinos manager grows starry-eyed. And when high-tech criminals (led by Neal McDonough the villain of ""Red 2"") plot to steal artwork from the place they inevitably take Maya and Lane hostage and Blart in pursuit must employ his novelty arsenal.But first he must wrestle with a cantankerous exotic bird and have his face spattered with pink ice cream droppings as he seeks to remedy his hypoglycemia. Blarts efforts earn him a medal and again his colleagues if not viewers in the movie theater burst into applause.""Paul Blart Mall Cop 2"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for reasons I cannot fathom.

By abandoning most of what made the original Paul Blart an OK watch and surprise hit way back in 2009 the film pratfalls into mirthless idiocy much like the title buffoon played by Kevin James.Blart was a lovable doofus in his first outing riding his ridiculous Segway while patrolling a New Jersey shopping mall as if his life depended on it -- which it sort of did for this wannabe policeman when the movie turned into a Die Hard parody.In Mall Cop 2 hes just an obnoxious jerk with an inflated ego. Blart endlessly tries to coast off the brief fame from his accidental heroics of years previously. A single father hes also become even more of a paranoid control freak subjecting his sweet teenage daughter Maya (Raini Rodriguez) to helicopter parenting that borders on abuse. The scene shifts from Jersey to Las Vegas in a breathtaking act of corporate whoring Wynn Las Vegas amp; Encore Resort site of the security convention Blart is attending gets so many gratuitous plugs it should be listed above the marquee as one of the main actors. Resort mogul Steve Wynn even makes a cameo appearance.Two characters from film one are brutally dispatched in the opening seconds Blarts mom (Shirley Knight) is hit by a speeding milk truck; his girlfriend (Jayma Mays) becomes his wife for an eye blink exiting after six days of marriage to Blart induce ""uncontrollable vomiting.""They get off lucky. The rest of us who sit through this 94-minute belch have to endure not only endless fat-guy stumbles -- arent morbid obesity and hypoglycemic comas just a scream -- but also such appalling sights as Blart punching an elderly woman in the stomach knocking her flat and nearly unconscious.All in service of another dumb hero story with Blart seeking to stop a gang of professional art thieves (led by the inevitable Neal McDonough) from fleecing Wynns stash of van Goghs and other European masters.Put-upon Maya gets dragged in natch and the rest of the plot is padded out with a bizarre and creepy attempt at injecting romance into this sad affair. Daniella Alonso gamely plays the designated love victim.Andy Fickman directs with as much flair as he demonstrated previously with the likes of Shes the Man and You Again. Which is to say none at all.The real blame however falls squarely upon the shoulders of Kevin James who again co-writes with Nick Bakay while also taking a production credit. Why did they think it would be a good idea to make Blart unlikeable?We need not wonder why this Paul Blart sequel wasnt previewed for movie critics prior to its landing with a splat at theatres on Friday. We could ask though why James and studio Sony waited six years to make it only to squander the time and effort expended.

For Sony and Kevin James to once again cash in on the success of their 146 million-grossing surprise 2009 hit all they had to do was make a product that resembled a film--something around 90 minutes with a beginning middle and end. Whatever happened in between all of those points didnt matter so much as long as people could pay money to watch it. It didnt have to have any jokes. The closest thing that the movie has to a running gag is pointing out that Paul genuinely cares about his ""silly"" working-class job and its a punchline that he drives a Toyota. There didnt need to be any emotional pull. Paul doesnt want his daughter to leave for college for no other reason than to create tension for the family to resolve at the end. There didnt need to be much of a story which has Paul foiling an art heist in Las Vegas thats completely unrelated to him until his daughter wanders into it. The movie doesnt even have to take place in a mall--there are literally two scenes set there. The sad thing is that it appears the filmmakers behind Paul Blart Mall Cop 2 understood these expectations and just went through the necessary motions to meet the bare minimum. The result--a cinematic shoulder shrug--is far from the worst movie that youll ever see but you might leave wondering why you the people on the screen or anyone else in the theater even bothered.

(Matt Kennedy/Columbia Pictures) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Friday April 17 2015 336 PM Title Paul Blart Mall Cop 2 Film Info With Kevin James The Jersey security guard goes to Vegas. Director; Andy Fickman (134). PG. Area theaters. ""That is poison"" Thats Paul Blart (Kevin James) worrying about someone biting into an old brown banana in ""Paul Blart Mall Cop 2."" He could be talking about this atrocious movie which is the cinematic equivalent of biting into an old brown banana. It wouldnt be hard to be at least a little better than 2009s first ""Blart"" a very dumb but financially successful comedy for the former ""King of Queens"" star. But being worse? Thats a real accomplishment. Dumped by his girlfriend after six days of marriage and stunned by his mom being killed by a truck we find Blart is need of a vacation. So he and his college-bound daughter Maya (Raini Rodriguez) leave Jersey and head to a ""Security Officers Training Association"" convention in a Wynn casino and hotel in Las Vegas. Its there that the entire rest of the movie takes place inside basically an hour-and-a-half commercial for Wynn. If youre hoping for some Vegas atmosphere or maybe even a street scene dont look for it here. You also shouldnt look for wit fun or any inventive slapstick. As Maya flirts with a hotel employee and frets about leaving her dad - whos still employed by the West Orange Pavilion Mall - for UCLA Blart meets up with old pals and stumbles upon a heist of art from the hotel. For the first hour the big jokes are Blart scooting around on a Segway and Blart wearing a flowered shirt and cargo shorts. If thats not side-splitting for you then you likely wont enjoy Blart asking an all-midget KISS tribute band fit they played ""Beth."" If however you think thats all comedy gold wait until you see Blart scuttling across the floor on his side or popping up in the middle of a Cirque du Soleil-like water show wearing wings. Stop youre killing me. James everyman appeal is stretched to the limits here like that polyester shirt he wears. Always willing to try a silly dance or pratfall the comic actors enthusiasm winds up making us sad instead of buoyant. Hes jumping around fighting a bird and hopping around for this? James sequel may actually be worse than the 2009 comedy hit says our critic. (Matt Kennedy/SONY PICTURES ENTERTAINMENT INC) There is one small smirk-inducing line as Blart and the lead art thief (Ray Liotta look-alike Neal McDonough) exchange ever-more-ridiculous threats. ""I will bring a folk guitar to a pumpkin fight because thats how crazy I am"" screams Blart. Look I said it was a small smirk. In a film as eye-searingly idiotic as ""Paul Blart; Mall Cop 2"" thats like finding a steak in a field of brown bananas. ON A MOBILE DEVICE? WATCH THE TRAILER.

Photo Matt Kennedy/CTMG Nobody was expecting much from Paul Blart Mall Cop 2 but did it have to be this unimaginative and lifeless? The original wasnt exactly Sherlock Jr. to begin with but you might have thought that given its success Kevin James and Co. could try to take the second one into stranger edgier more interesting territory ... Oh who am I kidding? As Homer Simpson once said ""Its okay money. Your moneys money is aaall thats money."" The first Paul Blart did the trick and made bank. The second one is the same trick with a different setting and a Wynn Casinos promotional tie-in. When we catch up with Paul Blart and his beloved family it turns out the happy ending of the first film was an illusion. His beautiful new wife has left him after six days. ""She had regrets"" were told but ""her doctor called it uncontrollable vomiting."" This is the kind of half-assed gross-out gag these movies traffic in -- suggested retrospective grossness without any actual grossness. (To be fair I dont know which option is worse; its not like I wanted to see vomiting.) A Also Blarts beloved mother has been flattened by a milk truck. (That gag we do see.) So he cowers at home crying like a baby with only his daughter Maya (Raini Rodriguez whose life-affirming presence lifted the first film as well) to give him support. Things start to look up though when our mopey hero gets an invite to attend a Security Officers Association trade show in Las Vegas. (Maya meanwhile gets accepted into UCLA but doesnt have the heart to tell her needy overprotective Pa.) Daddy and daughter pack up their things and head to Sin City. But since the film is doing double-duty as a promo piece for Vegas dont expect anything truly sinful or dark. The big unstated joke in this movie is that the city itself is now basically just a larger high-end shopping mall. And so Paul and Maya run into shenanigans that feel eerily familiar to what happened before. In the first film a group of hooligans out for a Black Friday heist at the local mall took Maya and Blarts then-object-of-affection hostage; this time its a group of tech-savvy art thieves who take Maya and a boy shes interested in hostage. Before Blart was looked down upon by the New Jersey State Police who didnt think of him as a real security pro; this time its a sneering Vegas security team led by Eduardo Verastegui. Time is a flat circle and so is this fucking movie.A A shame because Kevin James is a guy with some talent -- an inherent sincerity crossed with unlikely physical grace (you can read a whole article I wrote about this phenomenon here). On the surface the idea of him as a Segway-riding overcommitted security guard is a good one. But the movies themselves arent willing to commit -- almost as if theyre afraid to go in for the comic kill. When Blart arrives in Vegas hes briefly convinced that hell be asked to give the much-coveted keynote speech at his security convention. Its an ideal setup for some humiliation comedy but the film pulls its punches; it lets Blart dig a very small hole for himself then quickly abandon the gag before anybody is allowed to cringe as if to carry it through might be too cruel. Similarly there are some mild bits involving others poking fun at Blart for his overconfidence and self-importance but nothing ever cuts through; theyre all so gentle that you wonder if the film is afraid of hurting the character. (""Guys he can take it"" I wanted to yell back at the screen. ""Hes fictional you know"") And yet the film isnt beneath a gross-out scene of Kevin James getting suggestively spattered in the face with a leaking ice-cream cone during one of Blarts occasional attempts to combat his hypoglycemia. (Never mind that the movie appears to have conflated hypoglycemia with narcolepsy.) At least that gag however unfunny is somethingA -- gross dumb offensive. And its a good example of the weirdly frustrating position these movies put you in. Paul Blart Mall Cop 2 seemingly does the impossible It makes you wish it were dumber grosser and more offensive -- instead of the nothing movie that it is.A Tagsmovie reviewpaul blart mall cop 2movieskevin james Share on Facebook Tweet this Story Top Stories How UnREAL and the Republican National Convention Gave Us a Night of TV White Privilege Winona Ryder and the Power of Meta-Casting 8 Essential PokA(c)mon Go Tips Youall Want to Know Most Viewed Stories Constance Wu Slams Matt Damonas Great Wall Film for Perpetuating a aRacist Mytha 33.6k Shares Share Tweet LeBron James Reportedly Stopped Justin Bieber From Performing at the RNC 90 Shares Share Tweet John C.

Nothing aired by WikiLeaks could possibly be more destructive to Sonys reputation than the release of ""Paul Blart Mall Cop 2"" the sort of movie that goes beyond mere mediocrity to offer possible evidence of a civilization in decline. Predicated like the 2009 original on the repeated spectacle of Kevin James falling on his face or colliding with a series of heavy objects this tacky numbingly inane sequel also functions as a veritable product-placement playground -- only this time the playground isnt a New Jersey shopping mecca but rather the Wynn Las Vegas amp; Encore Resort whose participation saved the studio some 4.2 million in Nevada tax credits. And a good thing too insofar as the result is expected to post respectable numbers while falling short of the first pics 146 million domestic B.O. haul. Falling short of course is what that lovable loser Paul Blart (James) does again and again -- quite literally whether hes being thrown off his Segway by a convertible or conking out mid-conversation from hypoglycemia a condition that regularly turns him into some sort of sugar-deprived narcoleptic. Emotionally too Pauls life has taken a tumble In the first five minutes we see him and his g.f. (Jayma Mays reprising her role for 15 seconds) saying ""I do"" but she has second thoughts and divorces him six days later. Then his mother (Shirley Knight reprising her role for 10 seconds) dies after being run over by a milk truck. So much for the women in Pauls life with the exception of his loyal teenage daughter Maya (Raini Rodriguez) who cant quite bring herself to tell him that shes been admitted to UCLA which is a long way from Jersey. On the same day Maya gets her good news Paul receives an invitation to attend a security officers trade convention in Vegas -- or more precisely at the Wynn Las Vegas amp; Encore Resort -- and decides to attend thinking he might finally be recognized for the daring Black Friday rescue operation he pulled off back in 09. No such luck of course The real reason hes been invited is so that he can be repeatedly humiliated slighted knocked over attacked by exotic birds and occasionally unintentionally flirted with (by a game Daniella Alonso) all while wearing a succession of hideous tropical-colored polyester shirts. Evincing all the freshness and imagination of its title ""Paul Blart Mall Cop 2"" sets our roly-poly hero on a collision course with a sneering thief named Vincent (Neal McDonough in his umpteenth stock-villain role) whos trying to divest the Wynn Las Vegas amp; Encore Resort of its priceless art collection -- which you could see firsthand of course if you were to pay the Wynn Las Vegas amp; Encore Resort a visit. And while youre there you really might as well also go and check out that multimillion-dollar aquatic theater piece ""Le Reve"" a performance of which Paul naturally has to disrupt while being chased by one of Vincents gun-toting aim-challenged goons. Soon Paul will have to call on his sad-sack security-guard brethren (they include Loni Love Gary Valentine and Shelly Desai) for backup forming a sort of sub-Avengers league with Tasers and other non-lethal weapons. By a chance turn of events Paul winds up giving the trade conventions keynote speech allowing him to hold forth on the daily indignities and fleeting rewards of being a security guard. Its the one mildly amusing scene in the script (penned by returning scribes James and Nick Bakay) which has been directed with bumbling anonymity by Andy Fickman (taking over for the originals Steve Carr) and lensed with seemingly no coherent visual ideas beyond ""Get the Wynn Las Vegas amp; Encore Resort in the background as much as possible"" even if it requires that a simple poolside conversation be shot with a wide-angle lens. Inevitably perhaps there comes the moment when Steve Wynn himself makes a pointless cameo (by all appearances having just emerged from his tanning bed) though not necessarily more pointless than the moment when Paul finds himself in the same elevator with Mini Kiss. James and Rodriguez have an appreciably sweet father-daughter rapport and the drama of whether or not Maya should go to UCLA (which is basically held up here as the Wynn Las Vegas amp; Encore Resort of universities) helps tether the movie to a somewhat recognizable reality. But James -- an inherently likable screen presence who even without the ""Paul Blart"" movies would have far too much Adam Sandler-produced crap on his resume (""Zookeeper"" ""Grown Ups"" ""Grown Ups 2"") -- deserves a much better signature role than the one hes written for himself. There are surely better uses of this actors gut grin and Everyman appeal than the scene in which he has to lie down underneath a girls dripping ice-cream cone or the one where hes forced to hurl himself down a flight of stairs while encased in bulletproof luggage. ""Help someone today"" Paul Blart urges his keynote listeners; with any luck hell take his own advice and keep us from having to see him in a movie ever again.

Remo Cino says July 5 2015 at 635 pm I dont know where to start. I could only stomach 15 mins of this piece of tripe. Kevin James is the guy at the party with the lampshade on his head. A one trick pony begging for laughs. He is a pathetic poor excuse for an actor. Why why does Hollywood keep churning up this crap ??????? Please if you havent seen this film dont. Reply Jeanette says April 19 2015 at 849 pm The movie was horrible. I actually shut my eyes for about an hour but at the end kinda got interesting.. Stay with TV man. That movie was horrible Reply Phil Lan says April 18 2015 at 1049 pm He should have never ended King of Queens. He needs to stick to the king of queens style comedy. Here comes the boom and zoo keeper were his only somewhat good movies. Reply Sam America says April 18 2015 at 952 pm no talent fat over paid actor who had a horrible tv show and makes horrible movies like Sandler and the rest of the not funny crew from SNL like Fallon Fey and that stupid blonde whos her sidekick and on that horrible tv show on NBC national broadcasting communist with no ratings hollyweird sucks Reply lisa delille bolton says April 18 2015 at 721 pm Fine you didnt like it. See Here Comes the Boom or make the movie you wanted to watch instead. Kevin James remains an honest genius and a charm bomb; I would follow him anywhere. Peanut butter does in fact smooth over the cracks in the heart and it is in fact hard to find someone to catch you when you fall in love. Plus so nice see a movie that you can watch on a saturday afternoon in the theatre with your teenager and his friends and just laugh happily together without being embarrassed by four-syllable F words or creepy butt sex references or tired strip club scenes or cliche clouds of weed. I cant be the only mom who feels this way. Reply Bonnie Lee says April 18 2015 at 607 pm From your very first sentence I saw through your bias and mentioning Wiki Leaks it was doubly obvious. This movie made me laugh. That is what I needed. Your review is horrible and hateful. Rather than missing out on any more Paul Blart I intend to miss out on your future review. Reply Lee Rudnicki says April 18 2015 at 1117 am I would like to formally nominate this as the meanest film review in the history of cinema. Then opening sentence alone deserves special recognition. Reply scout124 says April 17 2015 at 838 pm Wondering what movies Sony turned down so they could make... THIS... Reply Miles Quatermass says April 17 2015 at 1226 pm Also Give Paul Blart back to Marvel Sony. Only they can save this franchise now. Reply Miles Quatermass says April 17 2015 at 1225 pm This review almost feels like a dare. Nice try Mr Chang but Im still not going anywhere near this turd. Reply Macd says April 17 2015 at 1212 pm Many thanks Mr. Chang for your hilarious review which Im certain is funnier than anything in this wretched movie. SONY is certainly on a roll-downhill all the way Reply REVIEWER says April 17 2015 at 1154 am Stop making fun of this movie and these actors they try to make a funny movie to earn some money and make people laugh so if youre just gonna call them fat and stupid then you are just a sad little lowlife a sadist Reply Spike says April 17 2015 at 1052 am hes right. for sony to spend  on this piece of s-t shows that the civilization is in decline along with the average IQ of the moviegoer Reply Michael says April 17 2015 at 1239 pm You must be a great sense of humor in real life. Its a movie to laugh get over it and focus on your life. Reply cadavra says April 17 2015 at 1038 am This entire subgenre of fat people knocking things over and falling down (yes Im looking at you too Melissa McCarthy) became real tiresome ages ago. Move on people. Reply I am Dr. Hug says April 17 2015 at 1006 am Hilarious. hahaha. Reply THEPUPPETMAN says April 17 2015 at 924 am Nevada is a right to work state. I love Vegas. Steve Wynn loves Vegas. Have a drink... Do some filming... Save some money. Live. Oh yea... I want to nominate Steve Wynn for an Academy award. Scott Land. Reply Don Benn says April 17 2015 at 900 am Wow What a well written rotten review. Now Im not a film reviewer.....just a 63 year old guy who has been going to the movies since they were twenty five cents.....so I cant disagree with anything you said. What I will say is that movies like Paul Blart...with any  at the end......are made for audiences who want to laugh....at movies like Paul Blart. It may not be fine cinema.....but for simple folks like me its a heck of a lot of fun.....and if a movie makes me laugh or smile...or both.....well then I think its pretty good. Reply Bony Hurdle says April 17 2015 at 309 pm ""...movies like Paul Blart...are made for audiences who want to laugh"" - Don Benn Obviously. So should the critic have started his review with ""I know movies like this are made for people who want to laugh but I didnt find it funny at all."" And then list all the reasons why...

Daily Edition Login to download Paul Blart Mall Cop 2 Film Review 530 AM PDT 4/17/2015 by Frank Scheck FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS Makes the original look like an unheralded classic TWITTER Kevin James returns as the title character in this sequel to 2009s surprise comedy hit. Despite the fact that shes featured prominently in the credits two-time Oscar nominee Shirley Knight disappears within the first few minutes of Paul Blart Mall Cop 2 her character unceremoniously run over by a milk truck. Lucky her. Audiences forced to sit through this belated sequel to 2009s surprise hit Kevin James comedy will not be as fortunate. While the original was no classic it had a few mild laughs and the plus-sized actor displayed a certain buffoonish charm. Such is not the case with this painfully unfunny slapdash follow-up in which the title character is so relentlessly obnoxious that youll be cheering for the villains. Read More Ryan Gosling in Talks to Star in Blade Runner Sequel Not that theyre anything to write home about either as led by veteran cinematic bad guy Neal McDonough. The films idea of giving the actor the opportunity to stretch is by having him wear a brown contact lens over one of his normally crystalline blue eyes. The plot (or what little there is of it) concerns the titular mall security guard traveling to Las Vegas for a security convention with his 18-year-old daughter (Raini Rodriguez) in tow. Led to believe that hell be the surprise keynote speaker (arent these things supposed to be arranged in advance?) he proceeds to alienate everyone around him including the hotels beautiful general manager (Daniella Alonso) who in one of the endlessly tiresome running gags Blart becomes convinced is constantly hitting on him. More egregiously it later turns out that she does indeed find herself unaccountably attracted to the boorish rent-a-cop. Speaking of running gags the filmmakers seem convinced that the mere sight of James atop a Segway is inherently amusing an idea that quickly wears out its welcome. Read More Wonder Woman Movie Finds a New Director (Exclusive) Anyway Blart becomes unwittingly embroiled in a plot by the villain and his gang to steal priceless artworks from the Wynn Las Vegas hotel where the movie was almost entirely filmed and which receives enough product placement to have presumably paid for the films obviously low budget. At one point Blart blunders into the resorts long-running stage show Le Reve (ka-ching) and later Steve Wynn and his wife make a cameo appearance. Labored sequences abound from Blarts violent fight with an angry peacock to when in an effort to raise his sagging blood sugar he lies underneath a childs dripping ice-cream cone lapping up the drops like a baby bird. James tries hard very hard to inject the proceedings with slapstick humor propelling his large body through endless physical contortions in a fruitless effort for laughs. But while the actor has proved his comic skills in previous projects hes completely adrift here. He also has to bear a large part of the blame since he co-wrote the screenplay. As for credited director Andy Fickman (Parental Guidance) he apparently went AWOL.

In this case what happened in Vegas should surely have stayed in Vegas.

Rated PG (mild violence). As I walked out of the theater after seeing the Kevin James ""Paul Blart"" sequel I had two things on my mind The Wynn Las Vegas hotel and Cirque du Soleils ""Le Reve"" show both of which get relentless product placement throughout. The rest was a blur of weak slapstick one over-dyed moustache and vague sexism ageism and sizeism (most of the latter directed at James by James). Picking up the plot of the first movie and relocating it to Vegas ""Paul Blart Mall Cop 2"" sees James obnoxious rent-a-cop attending a security officers conference where his daughter Maya (Raini Rodriguez) is kidnapped by some ""Oceans Eleven"" knockoffs planning to steal artwork from the hotel with the help of a crooked NSA agent (this plot point communicated via subtle dialogue like ""Well Id say I bankrolled the right NSA agent""). But this wisp of a plot is just an excuse for James to do his one trick over and over Bluster then screw up humiliatingly. Is it never funny? No its not never funny. Its just not funny nearly often enough. I laughed when he ran face-first into a plate glass window like a cartoon character and at a drawn-out gag about a man eating a horrifyingly brown banana. But thats two minutes out of 94. This is a movie that features a recurring punchline about hypoglycemia and another about how beautiful women (here Daniella Alonso) fall for Blart because hes such an arrogant dismissive jerk to them. One elderly woman gets run over by a truck another gets punched in the stomach. The comic minds at work here are shall we say limited (director Andy Fickman also brought you the cringe-worthy Billy Crystal comedy ""Parental Guidance""). The script by James and Nick Bakay is running on the fumes of better movies -- Jim Carreys ""Ace Ventura"" series being an obvious inspiration. And I think even the spazzy Ace would call this one a loser.

This oft-ridiculed screen giant is here to answer a question that has plagued mankind for decades now what would a film be like if every single person involved made as little effort as humanly possible? Its been six years since the inexplicably successful Paul Blart Mall Cop and our hero (Kevin James) is in a rut. His wife has left him his mother was flattened by a milk truck (just one in a series of oddly brutal sideswipes against elderly women) and his daughter Maya (Raini Rodriguez) is planning to leave home. When he gets an offer to attend a security officers convention in Las Vegas Paul jumps at the chance. Given that it comes courtesy of Adam Sandlers production company Happy Madison - the good folks behind such comedy classics as You Dont Mess With the Zohan and Grown Ups 2 - its no surprise that Paul Blart Mall Cop 2 is a lazy witless laugh-free experience. But even by their standards this is a slog to sit through so glacially paced that at times it achieves an almost zen-like level of anti-comedy. Expect the next film to consist solely of James silently piloting his Segway around in a white room for 90 minutes. By Tom Huddleston Posted Friday April 10 2015 Details Release details Rated PG Release date Friday April 10 2015 Duration 94 mins Cast and crew Director Andy Fickman Screenwriter Nick Bakay Kevin James Cast Kevin JamesRaini RodriguezEduardo Verastegui Users say (1) 1 out of 5 stars Average User Rating1 / 5Rating Breakdown5 star04 star03 star02 star01 star1LiveReviews|11 person listeningSign inWrite reviewMost helpfulMost helpfulHighest ratingLowest ratingNewestOldestLoadingundefinedNew ReviewsRefreshApr 22 20151 of 1 found helpfulRhys DFeaturedI think saying this film is a ""lazy witless laugh-free experience"" is doing it a disservice. This might possibly be the worst thing ever made by a human aside perhaps Jack amp; Jill. It is full of comedy (please read this with the most sarcastic tone you can muster up) that takes repeated swipes at various demographics in what is a very racist homophobic xenophobic and ageist script that shoehorns in these comedy (read above) elements to make up for the fact it was probably drawn up on a legal pad by the execs over at Wynn Hotel amp; Happy Madison to get some advertising for Wynn (which it achieves) in order to further the goals of what is one of the most blatant Hollywood extortion rackets in existence. Remind yourself that this film had a reported budget of 30 million and then just sit back and think about that. 30 million to film a guy in a hotel (which presumably wanted the production there in the first place) driving around on a segway falling into a pool of water and delivering hilarious jokes which actually didnt have anything even remotely approaching funny at all. Id beseech people to vote with their wallets and spend their hard earned cash on say an ice cream in the park or some new shoes or even just burning it over an effigy of Paul Blart rather than go see this film. People should pay this film the same respect it pays the various people who are the butt of its hilarious discriminatory and prejudicial jokes; none. Ive given it one star but that actually does a disservice to the other films that have garnered one star reviews. This film is so bad its actually accrued an arrears of stars it owes reviewers and customers alike. Bet we cant wait for installment 3 eh?
