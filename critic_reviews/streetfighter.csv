Just when he was beginning to develop a more relaxed style in movies like ""Hard Target"" and broaden his appeal with ""Timecop"" Jean-Claude Van Damme takes a career step backward in ""Street Fighter"" a messy basically plotless bigscreen rendition of the popular multimedia game. Avid users of the videogame and Van Dammes loyal fans may embrace the film out of curiosity but this uninvolving movie will fail to achieve the results of the stars last outings. Still ""Street Fighter"" may initially benefit from being the only holiday actioner other than ""Drop Zone"" and as always with Van Dammes vehicles will have more bite offshore. Electronic videogames with their built-in audiences present an alluring challenge for filmmakers though they are obviously not easy to translate into exciting feature-length presentations. In fact ""Street Fighter"" suffers from the same problems that impaired ""Super Mario Bros."" It is noisy overblown and effects-laden and lacks sustained action or engaging characters. Like the 1993 picture ""Street Fighter"" is too disjointed and far less captivating than the videogame that inspired it. Van Damme plays Col. Guile the military commander of the Allied Nations forces assigned to defeat Gen. Bison (Raul Julia) the megalomaniac dictator of a country called Shadaloo in order to rescue 63 kidnapped relief workers held hostage by the psychotic ruler. When the Allied Nations succumb to Bisons demands for a huge ransom the protesting Guile is relieved of his command. But the feisty fighter disobeys orders and leads a commando force of tough street fighters on a covert mission that brings him face-to-face with the corrupt warlord. The two men who play archetypes are surrounded by some colorful characters who add flavor to the proceedings such as attractive TV reporter Chun-Li (Ming-Na Wen) who has her personal agenda for wanting to destroy Bison; Sagat (Wes Studi) Bisons arms supplier who controls the toughest gang in Southeast Asia; and Dhalsim (Roshan Seth) Bisons captive biophysicist whos forced to conduct unethical genetic experiments for the creation of the ultimate fighting warrior. Steven E. de Souza a veteran of some functional action scripts (the ""Die Hard"" movies ""48 Hrs."") makes an unimpressive directorial debut in this misconceived adventure. In shooting the climactic scenes de Souza keeps the camera too close to the action which is too often unnecessarily fractured failing to build any continuity or momentum. Technically speaking the cutting executed by five editors leaves much to be desired. Its hard to fathom what motivated a star like Van Damme to take such a small  insignificant assignment that doesnt showcase his special skills to advantage. Sporting red hair and wearing a military uniform Van Damme delivers mostly one-liners some of which are actually funny. Targeted for children and Van Dammes first PG-13-rated pic ""Street Fighter"" sports a sensibility more humorous than terrifying or violent. But Van Damme disappears for long stretches during which the action drags and meanders in too many directions. The films various locations (Bangkok Bisons secret subterranean base) are meant to evoke the exotic settings of the likes of the James Bond movies and futuristic epics a la ""Star Wars"" and ""Blade Runner."" Ironically the result is just a busy cluttered screen that is not particularly handsome -- despite prodigious efforts by lenser William A. Fraker designer William Creber and special visual and sound effects hands. As the villain who behaves like a tyrannical emperor Julia renders one of his weakest performances accentuating each and every syllable as if he were reciting a Shakespearean role of grand emotional range. Its too bad for this is the accomplished actors last film and it is dedicated to him. ""Street Fighters"" most notable aspects are its multicultural cast which includes black Asian Hispanic Indian and British performers and the strong role it offers to the beautiful Ming-Na Wen (""The Joy Luck Club"") as a dauntless TV reporter turned tough warrior.

"Street Fighter (PG-13) Street Fighter (PG-13) By Richard Harrington Washington Post Staff Writer December 24 1994 What can you say when a video game is more exciting and entertaining than the big-budget feature film it inspires? Not much and thats exactly the problem with ""Street Fighter"" a Jean-Claude Van Damme vehicle based on the popular vidgame ""Street Fighter II."" Of course the filmmakers couldnt use that title since it would screw up any possible sequels and confuse young viewers. Fortunately were as unlikely to see a ""Street Fighter"" sequel as we are to see one to the last video/film fiasco ""Super Mario Bros."" Programmed rather than plotted ""Street Fighter"" is notable only for being the last film made by Raul Julia an actor far too skilled for the demands of the evil warlord Gen. M. Bison but far too professional to give anything less than his best. Julia does not look good -- there is a pallor and tautness about him thats disconcerting in context -- but he plays Bison as a full-throttle madman one who has kidnapped a bus-load of hostages threatening to kill them unless a 20 billion ransom is paid within 72 hours. To the inevitable rescue comes Col. Guile (Van Damme) irreverent leader of the Allied Nations troops and possessor of the most convoluted accent among many. Guile turns out to be an inspirational leader but an inspirational speaker hes not. In his quest the colonel is aided by a mysterious television reporter (Ming-Na Wen of ""The Joy Luck Club"") two GQ-friendly mercenary con men (Damian Chapa and Byron Mann) an ex-sumo wrestler (Peter Tuiasosopo) and a former boxer (Grand L. Bush) and a half-dozen ciphers (including Kylie Minogue the worst actress in the English-speaking world). Bisons hench-villians include Wes Studi as the one-eyed arms dealer Sagat Andrew Bryniarski as brainless bodyguard Zangief and break dancer Jay Tavare as the preening cage-killer Vega. Since the film is PG-13 none of the violence that breaks out with predictable regularity is particularly believable or engrossing. Some of the film merely mimics the action of the game; at least in the game you get to participate in the bellicosity. One major problem is that the film is made up of scenes that seldom connect; for long stretches characters simply disappear and none of them is half as interesting as Bison to begin with. The special effects are cheesy the costumes cloned from Nazi sci-fi and kung fu films. First-time director Steven E. de Souza actually did much better in his scripts for another indecipherable muscle-bound actor Arnold Schwarzenegger (""Commando"" and ""The Running Man""); behind the camera his novice status is all too apparent.

"In Street Fighter everyones game for violence - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search Home Delivery HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsHomesLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie Review Street Fighter The Legend of Chun-Li In Street Fighter everyones game for violence By Michael Hardy Globe Correspondent / March 2 2009 Email| Print| Single Page| | Text size - + The most remarkable thing about ""Street Fighter The Legend of Chun-Li"" is that it probably wont be a candidate for the worst movie of the year. That by itself defies expectations for the second live-action movie based on Capcoms popular arcade game franchise. (The first was 1994s ""Street Fighter"" starring Jean-Claude Van Damme.) The game first released in 1987 was based on a then-novel concept Two players choose characters from an international cast of martial arts experts and attempt to beat their opponent into bloody pulp by banging away at the arcade buttons. It was a sort of cartoon Ultimate Fighting Championship before the fact.The new film provides the background and characterization that the game couldnt. It focuses on Chun-Li (Kristin Kreuk) the daughter of a wealthy Hong Kong businessman kidnapped by a very blond very angry character named Bison (Neal McDonough). Bison runs a crime syndicate whose major operation appears to consist of razing Southeast Asian slums and building luxury houses on top of them - an Extreme Makeover Bangkok Edition as it were.To rescue her father Chun-Li joins forces with the martial arts master Gen (Robin Shou) who teaches her to perform midair somersaults using only a hidden harness and a cable-and-pulley system. Having proven adept at wire fu Chun-Li goes on a Tarantino-inspired roaring rampage of revenge beating up a succession of comically named villains before she gets her chance to Kill Bison.I suppose a movie called ""Street Fighter"" lives and dies by its fight sequences and Im happy to report that it contains enough bone-snapping skull-crunching eye-gouging blood-gushing action to satisfy even the most Ritalin-addled 13-year-old; this is a movie for the overcaffeinated undereducated teenager in all of us.
