"Blocked Borders washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids Blocked Borders Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Jen Chaney Special to The Washington Post Friday October 24 2003 ANGELINA JOLIE has laid down her arms. At least she has momentarily done so in ""Beyond Borders"" a sprawling and unconvincing love story. In it the Oscar-winning actress moves away from her alpha-female Lara Croft persona and into the role of Sarah Jordan a woman compelled to devote her life to refugee relief work. Like Lara Sarah wants to save the world. But she chooses to do it by feeding mouths rather than kicking butts. Unfortunately neither Jolie nor her co-star the rugged Clive Owen can save this well-intentioned but astonishingly flat movie which sinks beneath the weight of romantic cliches and pat plot developments that conveniently send Jolies character to nearly as many war-torn corners of the globe as U2s Bono. This young-humanitarians-in-love story begins in 1984 at a London charity ball where Sarah and her husband Henry Bauford (Linus Roache) are among the many formally dressed revelers on hand to honor Henrys father the head of an international nonprofit. The party gets crashed abruptly by Nick Callahan (Owen) a renegade doctor who harshly demands increased funding for the impoverished areas where he works bringing along an emaciated African boy as a visual aid. After vilifying everyone present Dr. Nick is hauled off by the authorities but not before the camera closes in on Sarahs stricken tear-streaked face. As the song ""We Are the World"" told us during this same era ""There comes a time / When we heed a certain call."" This apparently is Sarahs time. In short order shes off to Africa -- wearing a pearl-white Audrey Hepburn-esque ensemble natch -- where she saves a dying child and comes face to face with Nick whos hardly happy to see her privileged puss. If the movies have taught us anything though its that two actors with such supple sets of lips are destined to kiss. Indeed the inevitable attraction between the two altruists lays the foundation for the rest of the movie which unfolds over a decade and takes Sarah to Cambodia and Chechnya. In a better movie Jolie and Owen could have made a smoldering couple. But here thanks to a contrived screenplay its difficult to care whether they hook up or break up. Despite the actors best efforts neither of the characters comes across as particularly likable. Sarahs disregard for her young children -- whom she thoughtlessly leaves behind every time she impulsively travels to the destitute spot of the moment -- is particularly self-absorbed. In the end Sarah and Nick seem more obsessed with each other than with the needy people theyre supposed to help. Director Martin Campbell succeeds occasionally in his attempts to convey the horrors and frustrations that dog the lives of do-gooders. The scenes set in Africa for example provide telling glimpses of what its like to work in a place where finding space to bury more bodies is a commonplace concern. A deeper and more careful examination of these themes and less of the love story might have made this a more credible piece of cinema. Of course its impossible to watch ""Beyond Borders"" without being reminded of Jolies own charitable efforts. Her involvement in this film is what sparked her interest in relief work which eventually led to her appointment as goodwill ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Her commitment to humanitarian causes by all appearances is steadfast and sincere. For that she deserves great praise something that ""Beyond Borders"" doesnt manage to earn.

But those intentions would have been better served by a compelling documentary rather than a far-fetched romantic adventure. Angelina Jolie slums her way through Beyond Borders a film that telegraphs its plot and then drags ploddingly its humane spirit obscured by an inane script and Jolies implausible character. The harrowingly realistic shots of famine victims are not enough to make this story believable. Angelina Jolie in a scene from the motion picture Beyond Borders. By Francois Duhamel Mandalay Pictures Heres the gist Privileged glamour girl becomes a humanitarian overnight going to Ethiopia Chechnya and Cambodia to help those wounded starving and displaced by war. She puts her mouth where her money is expressing dismay by pursing her bee-stung lips and looking stricken to approximate sadness and concern. This is set in motion at a charity ball when a handsome doctor barges in. (Clive Owens fiery intensity is a bit one-note especially after his nuanced performances in Croupier and Gosford Park.) He interrupts a lavish affair to shock attendees into seeing the real face of poverty. The face belongs to a hauntingly gaunt Ethiopian boy. Moved Sarah decides to donate her savings and time to famine relief. While in Ethiopia she leaps out of a moving truck and clutches a starving baby to her chest shooing a vulture off the body of the babys mother. It would have helped us to accept this glossy babe having a crisis of conscience if her stylish white pants and blouse had gotten even a speck of dust on them while she toiled in the Ethiopian desert. Her spanking white espadrilles make a stark contrast to the fly-ridden corpses covering the desert floor. About the movie Beyond Borders  (out of four) Stars Angelina Jolie Clive Owen Noah Emmerich Linus Roache Director Martin Campbel Distributor Paramount Pictures Rating R for language and war-related violence Opens today nationwide And while food and water are frighteningly scarce and deadly disease is rampant somehow there exists a perfectly playable piano in the remote desert. As she tickles the ivories Sarah wins over Nick who had dismissed her as a silly dilettante. Five years later Sarahs marriage is floundering but she has a young son and a good job at the United Nations. She leaves the comforts of home for Chechnya and the dashing doctor. A few years later (oddly her son hasnt aged) shes off to Cambodia. She and the good doctor are shot at by warring rebels but they take the time amid the flying bullets to kiss passionately. Much has been made of Jolies own humanitarian conversion. She may have the courage of her convictions as a goodwill ambassador for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees but Beyond Borders does her a disservice by focusing on her glamour-girl persona rather than allowing her to show what she can accomplish in a serious role.

In ""Beyond Borders"" the tri-part structure is slightly different Ethiopia Cambodia Chechnya. Apparently no part of the world is so devastated that Hollywood cant place a romance in its foreground. Its 1984 and at a black-tie fund-raiser for world relief Dr. Nick Callahan (Clive Owen of ""Croupier"") dressed in grungy clothes and dragging along an emaciated African boy crashes the joint to chastise the organization for cutting off his funding in Ethiopia allowing thousands to die. The crowds reaction to this interloper is mostly haughty bemusement -- someone even tosses a banana at the boy (who knew world-relief fund-raisers could be so cruel?) -- but two people are moved Sarah Jordan (Angelina Jolie) a recently married American socialite whose eyes widen and sadden in an approximation of sympathy; and Jan Steiger (Yorick van Wageningen) a nefarious sort with possible connections to the CIA whose eyes narrow with intrigue. Sarah is so moved in fact that she empties her bank account and travels with relief supplies to Ethiopia where she learns that giving relief is often a Faustian bargain. She attempts to save a mother and child (the effects of starvation in the film were created by computer graphics) but the mother dies and the child may soon follow. Movie review  ""Beyond Borders"" with Angelina Jolie Clive Owen Linus Roache Noah Emmerich. Directed by Martin Campbell. Written by Caspian Tredwell-Owen. 127 minutes. Rated R for language and war-related violence. Several theaters. Dr. Callahan meanwhile treats her brusquely as a know-nothing do-gooder -- which of course she is -- but shes feisty and argues back. Then one evening he hears her playing Schumann on an abandoned piano and falls in love. Since director Martin Campbell (""The Mask of Zorro"") makes this Ethiopian village look like Tatooine the desert planet in ""Star Wars"" the sudden appearance of a tuned piano seems suspect at best. Cut to Five years later. Sarah now works for UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) her husband is unemployed and philandering and Dr. Callahan is saving lives in Cambodia -- treading a thin line between Cambodian communists and the Khmer Rouge. When she accompanies relief supplies there they rekindle their flirtation. Unknown to her however hes smuggling weapons for Steiger in order to keep his operation going. The third and final part of the film takes place in Chechnya six years later. ""Beyond Borders"" is the kind of movie you feel like a jerk dismissing but here I go. There are intriguing performances (Owen in particular) and indelible images (a crying baby holding a hand grenade) but the globe-trotting and time-jumping undercut the drama while the physical suffering in the background makes us care less about the romantic suffering in the foreground. Jolie also acts a little too stunned in the first half of the movie to truly be interesting. A shame. Most of us are at best sympathetic observers and occasional donors to world-relief organizations. Jolie like her character in ""Beyond Borders"" actually got involved adopting a Cambodian son and becoming the U.N.s goodwill ambassador in 2001 a title she recently extended for two more years. Its an inspiring story. I just wish a better movie accompanied it.

(PG. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) . In ""Radio"" Cuba Gooding Jr. falls victim to the ""Nell"" syndrome in which a vibrant loquacious actor decides that the road to an Oscar nomination is to wear a slack expression and a set of ""Nutty Professor"" teeth. Here he plays a mentally challenged young man who is invited by the high school football coach to help out with the team. As a result an outsider finds a place within the community. ""Radio"" is almost as bad as it gets. That it isnt is thanks to Ed Harris who brings depth and focus to his performance as the coach. For Coach Jones helping Radio (Gooding) isnt a casual thing but a profound commitment and very nearly an irrational compulsion. He even leaves his wife and daughter at home on Christmas Eve to spend the evening with Radio. To the extent that its a character study ""Radio"" is a study of the coach whos awakened out of a spiritual slumber by the sight of this young fellow stumbling around outside the school pushing a shopping cart. The picture is based on the true story of James ""Radio"" Kennedy who became an assistant to coach Harold Jones at Hanna High School in South Carolina. Inevitably the nice people like Radio and the nasty people want no part of him. Actually the worst that could be said about Radio as played by Gooding is that hes annoying. Loud enthusiastic and annoying. To play someone mentally challenged is to invite bouquets but Goodings performance stays on the surface. Only Sean Penn in ""I Am Sam"" ever really got it right -- the way to play mental affliction is not to demonstrate your understanding of it but to be it in all its humanity and sadness. Do that and youve done something noble. Fall short and you end up looking silly really silly. -- Mick LaSalle BEYOND BORDERS Romantic adventure. Starring Angelina Jolie Clive Owen and Teri Polo. Directed by Martin Campbell. Written by Caspian Tredwell-Owen. (R. 127 minutes. At the AMC 1000 AMC Kabuki Metreon and Century 20 Daly City.) . ""Beyond Borders"" is a film with its heart in the right place. Unfortunately its head is stuck so far in the clouds that it dissolves into preachy do- gooder mush. Academy Award winner Angelina Jolie plays Sarah who is jolted from her cushy life by the raging-bull tactics of rogue doctor Nick Callahan (Clive Owen ""The Bourne Identity"") who confronts Sarah and her privileged English crowd with the horrors of refugee camps in Ethiopia. After shedding a single silver tear Sarah resolves to go to the camp despite warnings of danger and death. And if you arent clear on the concept stick around. It happens again and again in a two-hour-plus slog as Sarah follows Owens character from Ethiopia to Cambodia to Chechnya. In every case the situation is the same Children are dying the rebels are cruel and ruthless and Dr. Callahan is furious. Certainly the message is worth hearing. Camps like these exist the horror is real and the filmmakers spare no expense to make us feel the pain of the desperate threatened refugees. (It should be noted that the harrowing scenes of horribly malnourished children are created with the help of computer graphics.) But Dr. Callahan and Sarah are such bullheaded know-it-alls that it is hard to sympathize. Time and again they ignore perfectly sensible advice in favor of following their own headstrong convictions. Told that the violent Khmer Rouge are on the way to the Cambodian camp and will certainly kill refugees Dr. Callahan insists on lingering to administer vaccinations. He is told that they cannot spare the time. He pitches a fit starts giving vaccinations and sure enough the Khmer Rouge show up and kill people. Thanks for the help doctor. Without question Jolie the actress is deeply committed to this cause. After her involvement in this project she was appointed goodwill ambassador for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and was presented with the Citizen of the World Award for raising awareness of U.N. issues. But surely they wouldnt want to encourage more aid workers like Sarah who rolls into every camp with the moral certainty that she knows whats best. Shes not much for listening to good advice either. When Dr. Callahan is captured by Chechen rebels she marches right up to their mountain camp with no plan other than to tell them to let Callahan go right this minute. There is of course a romance between Jolie and Owen but the attraction is a puzzle. Dr. Callahan is such a shrill crusader fulminating and swearing that it is hard to picture him sweeping anyone off her feet. Meanwhile Sarahs husband Henry (Linus Roache) is such a soggy English crumpet that we are apparently supposed to believe that he doesnt deserve someone who happens to look like Lara Croft. - War violence language and unsettling images of malnutrition disease and death. -- C.W. Nevius THE REVOLUTION WILL NOT BE TELEVISED Documentary. Directed by Kim Bartley and Donnacha OBriain. (Not rated. 74 minutes. At the Castro through Thursday.) . The gods of cinema verite were smiling on Irish documentarians Kim Bartley and Donnacha OBriain when they arrived in Venezuela early last year to make a sympathetic documentary about the nations president Hugo Chavez. The populist leader -- a friend of Castro self-proclaimed champion of Venezuelas poor and enemy of the nations oil oligarchy -- granted Bartley and OBriain full access. But it was the extraordinary events of April 2002 that put them in a place they never expected to be trapped inside the presidential palace during a coup. The filmmakers kept filming and the result is ""The Revolution Will Not Be Televised"" which is instructive not only for students of South American (and oil) politics but also for anyone who questions the importance of the media in determining who gets power and how long they keep it. The film adopts the view of Chavez and his supporters that Venezuelas privately owned TV stations are simply tools of the countrys elite and have persistently tried to undermine Chavez because of his share-the-wealth rhetoric. (And it has been largely just that -- talk. Since his election to the presidency in 1998 Chavez has introduced economic reforms but the country has been hurt by general strikes and the gap between rich and poor remains wide.) Chavez a former army paratrooper is enough of a pragmatist to play the same game using state-run TV and radio to defend his policies and flagellate his critics. This is business as usual in a highly polarized society -- whoever controls the flow of information (and whether any information flows at all) has the upper hand. Media blackouts invective and innuendo and out-and-out lies are just ""politics by other means."" Bartley and OBriain who make no pretence of objectivity offer one particularly galling example of media abuse by Chavezs opponents of course. The anti-Chavez commercial stations repeatedly broadcast footage of what appeared to be Chavez supporters during the chaotic hours of marches and countermarches early in the coup firing on Chavezs opposition. But the filmmakers contend that the Chavez backers were actually shooting defensively at snipers and support their argument with footage that was left out of the broadcasts. Its a pretty brazen example of what a little editing can accomplish. In the end the coup only kept Chavez out of power for 48 hours (which says something about the efficiency and ruthlessness of his opponents) but at least 11 people were killed in the upheaval on the streets. Political invective and media manipulation have real victims. What sticks with you about this film is the disturbing sense of unreality inside the presidential palace during the coup of how quickly things can spin out of control -- what is really happening out there? Whom do you believe? What do you do now? The sensation is dizzying and you may feel relieved -- certainly the filmmakers do -- when Chavez re-enters the picture. Theres a feeling of order restored but the depiction of political free fall has been unnerving. Its a scary lesson and not just for Venezuela. -- Walter Addiego . GASOLINE Drama. Directed by Monica Stambrini. In Italian with English subtitles. (Not rated. 85 minutes. At the Opera Plaza.) . Theres no doubt that ""Gasoline"" is an earnest effort by first-time feature director Monica Stambrini. The 31-year-old Italian known by film festival- goers for her militant lesbian short films is skilled at wielding a digital video camera and she clearly loves her characters. But the finer less militant arts of screenwriting and plotting remain a work in progress. The setup is this Lenni (Regina Orioli) who works for her lover Stella (Maya Sansa) at a gas station receives a visit from her disapproving mother (Mariella Valentini) whom she hasnt seen in two years. La madre intent upon breaking up the relationship hits her in frustration; Stella comes to Lennis aid throwing a right hook at the mother who hits her head on a counter and dies instantly. Clearly an accident and a case of self-defense. By promptly calling the police the two would be exonerated. Instead Stella believes shell be sent to jail so she spearheads a plan to dump the body and drive off -- thus ensuring the police will be on their tail -- so the two can stay together. OK fair enough. They arent thinking clearly. It can happen. But what occurs after that goes from bad to ludicrous -- at one point Stella intentionally leaves her dog at the dumping place because the dog has wandered off and they need to get away before someone comes along. Then several hours later she decides they need to go back and find the dog. Stambrini whose bio lists her birthplace as Mountain View (although she seems to have grown up in Italy) captures some pleasing images edited adventurously on a low budget. She also has cast her film very well. Orioli and Sansa are energetic and bring as much complexity to their roles as their underwritten parts will allow. Oriolis wordless stares as she hears her mothers voice talking to her from the dead are pitch-perfect. The problem may lie in the source material -- Stambrini adapted ""Gasoline"" from a novel by Elena Stancanelli. However Stambrinis dialogue seems especially dull and the screenplay lacks dramatic urgency. ""Gasoline"" seems to indict a society that does not readily accept homosexuality. Aside from Lennis mother theres a group of doped-up young people who pop up occasionally -- like when the screenplay requires it -- to terrorize the couple. But that message is undercut by the fact that they begin hassling Stella before they know she is a lesbian -- so theyre not necessarily anti- homosexuals theyre just idiots in general. -- G.

Or visit Popular Alerts for suggestions. Manage alerts | What is this? (CNN) -- ""Beyond Borders"" is a powerful deeply moving film that takes you on a stirring journey straight to your heart. The film works on two levels -- as an emotional love story and as a thoughtful work that shines light on the dramatic and often appalling situations that have faced relief workers and millions of displaced people around the world. Angelina Jolie and Clive Owen heat up the screen with major sexual chemistry and give terrific performances. The story begins in 1984. Jolie plays Sarah Jordan a pampered naive American woman married to a wealthy Englishman. She lives a life of ease and privilege but her sheltered calm is shattered when a renegade doctor Nick Callahan (Owen) crashes a fancy charity dinner in London dragging along a starving young boy from his refugee camp in North Africa. In an extremely powerful scene the doctor lectures the startled crowd on what really needs to be done in terms of housing and feeding millions of refugees. His passionate plea makes the point that their feeble efforts hardly scratch the surface. Sarah experiences what can only be called an epiphany. Soon shes heading off -- at her own expense -- to Ethiopia with medicine and food. At first Nick dismisses Sarah as a misguided Girl Scout but her true desire to help -- and sincere efforts to make a difference -- finally force him to accept her. Slowly the two form a deep bond. At the front Clive Owen plays an idealistic doctor in ""Beyond Borders."" All too soon Sarah has to return to the real world but she is changed forever by her experiences in the refugee camp. She now has a deep commitment to humanitarian relief efforts and begins a career in London working for the United Nations. As her marriage freezes into a state of indifference she maintains contact with Nick through intimate letters. When Nick seeks help from the U.N. for wartorn Cambodia she not only sends relief she once again joins him on the front lines -- risking her life for the man she now knows she loves. Alongside him Sarah battles with the Khmer Rouge who are destroying Cambodia and blocking relief efforts. The two finally declare their love for each other but amid the danger and disease admit that being together is impossible. She returns to her son and husband in England. Soon she has a daughter and reluctantly buries her feelings for Nick. Years later -- it is now 1995 -- she learns that Nick is in danger in Chechnya where he is now heading relief efforts. She rushes to the area only to learn that Nick has been kidnapped and is being held for ransom. She bribes her way to his side. Yes love conquers all but the conclusion is thrilling nonetheless. Raising real issues This film is an epic love story but it is also much much more. ""Beyond Borders"" offers a stunning portrait of the desperation experienced by people on both sides of the relief equation -- those in need and those trying to help them. Its a movie about real issues and it doesnt shirk from presenting them honestly. In some ways ""Beyond Borders"" is three different films set in three different locations but with the same underlying themes -- love is universal humans are vulnerable creatures and people need other people to survive. The famines and wars in Ethiopia Cambodia and Chechnya made headlines for years but this film takes you into the hearts and souls of the real people -- the real hunger the real pain the real danger behind the news stories. ""Beyond Borders"" humanizes the refugees and the relief workers in a way that hasnt been done before. Jolie is brilliant. She gives another Oscar-worthy performance as Sarah a character who slowly changes from an innocent young woman into a strong centered adult with a great sense of purpose. Owen is also extremely good in the role of Nick. His barely restrained anger and frustration at the system -- and his growing love for Sarah -- is beautifully portrayed. Directed by Martin Campbell (1998s ""The Mask of Zorro"") and written by Caspian Tredwell-Owen ""Beyond Borders"" left me breathless and deeply moved. Sure in one way its just a very good love story -- but its also an amazing journey into some of the most complex issues of our times. ""Beyond Borders"" opens nationwide on Friday October 24 and is rated R.
