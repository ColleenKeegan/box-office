As it currently stands Kevin Smiths fourth feature seriously belabors its assault on the established denominations and institutions in particular the Roman Catholic Church that he thinks have become too corrupt and calcified to represent the great beliefs they should convey with purity and vigor. A very vulgar pro-faith comedy rather than a sacrilegious goof ""Dogma"" is an extraordinarily uneven film that significant cutting might be able to transform into a playable one. As it currently stands Kevin Smiths fourth feature seriously belabors its assault on the established denominations and institutions in particular the Roman Catholic Church that he thinks have become too corrupt and calcified to represent the great beliefs they should convey with purity and vigor. The subject matter is highly unusual for an American film to say the least and Miramax which had difficulties with ""Priest"" five years ago has already saved itself and parent company Disney grief by removing it from its slate and offering it for sale to buyers who were out in force for pics world preem in Cannes. A name cast led by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck and a fair share of laughs could help generate some initial business at least although pic should be cut by 30-40 minutes to maximize its comedy and minimize its scattershot nature. Editing the film will not be a simple matter as its not a question of eliminating whole big chunks but rather of concentrating on the good elements of scenes and shaving off the considerable clutter and stuff that doesnt work. Even though Smith has an almost unlimited number of points he wants to make and introduces myriad characters and often crazy means to express them the basic dynamic -- a very distant relative of Jesus Christ is recruited to save the world from two vengeful angels bent on its destruction -- is clear enough so coherence wont be hurt and could even be helped by trimming. Pic gets off to a bumpy start as three demonic kids beat up an older man with hockey sticks whereupon a cardinal in New Jersey (George Carlin) distressed over the churchs negative rep kicks off his ""Catholicism -- Now"" campaign by introducing a new image to replace the crucifix a statue of a jovial-looking Jesus winking and giving the thumbs-up sign. Numerous early cheap jokes including a nun abandoning her calling in order to pursue the pleasures of the flesh and a man reading Hustler magazine in church dont bode particularly well for whats to come. Things begin getting on track with the introduction of Bethany (Linda Fiorentino) a Catholic abortion clinic worker who is feeling a crisis of faith due to her disappointments in life beginning with her husband having left her and her inability to bear children. Bethany is recruited by Metatron (Alan Rickman) a disgruntled angel to save all of existence by putting a halt to a wicked plan being hatched by two fallen angels Bartleby (Affleck) and Loki (Damon); latter were kicked out of paradise centuries ago and banished for eternity to Wisconsin but intend to re-enter heaven by passing under an arch of a New Jersey church an act which in Smiths convoluted construct will prove Gods fallibility and bring an end to the world. For a good long time Bethany has no idea why she has been chosen for this task or how she is expected to go about it. But she sets out for the Garden State in the company of Smith regulars Jay (Jason Mewes) whos obscenely rude and tells Bethany he likes to hang at abortion clinics because its a good place to meet available chicks and sidekick Silent Bob (Smith). She soon acquires some additional cohorts beginning with nude black man named Rufus (Chris Rock) who falls from the sky and announces that he was the 13th apostle but was cut out of the Bible because of his color. Turning up as a stripper is a celestial muse named Serendipity (Salma Hayek) while a vaguely defined demon Azrael (Jason Lee) pops up at intervals with his hockey-sticking goons to threaten the group. Its an unholy stew but one with quite a few nuggets to be found in the pot. Intensely irreverent jokes and incidents are strewn throughout that make those in the much funnier ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" look timid by comparison. Firsthand accounts of God are given by the angels while Rufus insists that Jesus who was black is ""pissed"" about everything thats been done in His name over the past 2000 years; he then adds ""Nigger owes me 12 bucks."" At length Bethany realizes that she is the ""last scion"" of the Jesus line and becomes motivated to stop Bartleby and Loki who have started a killing spree on their own journey to New Jersey making for scenes of mass slaughter that will prove even more disagreeable to many U.S. viewers in the context of current events than they would have previously. If pic has a thread of seriousness running through it it is the doubting Bethanys struggle with her faith; she has every reason to reject it entirely but something inside her keeps it alive leading to a positive ultimate temporal result and a surprise fate that saves the film from pure sophomoric cynicism and anything-for-effect blasphemy. Two hours and 15 minutes is too long for almost any comedy and theres no reason this one should run much more than 90 minutes which would be plenty of time to contain all thats amusing in the picture. The other more insurmountable problem is that Smith demonstrates little interest in advancing his technical skills as a filmmaker; pic which has surprisingly been shot in widescreen looks ragged and unattractive where a stylish look and more visual invention would have spiffed up the proceedings and enhanced enjoyment. Cast members sometimes appear to be having fun and at others look like they dont know what theyve gotten themselves into another sign of the lack of stylistic consistency and control. Mewes generates more laughs than anyone followed by Rock while Fiorentino provides the only vaguely emotional connection. Pop diva Alanis Morissette surfaces late in the game as a truly goofy deity. Smith scored with his first and third pics ""Clerks"" and ""Chasing Amy"" bombed with his second ""Mallrats"" and has a problematic one now with his fourth. His writing skills and outrageous humor remain visible but discipline is sorely lacking a problem that could still be remedied somewhat with additional work. DogmaProductionA View Askew production.

"The Disrespected Arts Journalist Blues | | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Culture Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Observer Music The Disrespected Arts Journalist Blues By Justin Joffe  07/29/16 324pm Patron saint of schlubby music journalists Lester Bangs. More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

Essentially its a race against time comedy with disillusioned Fiorentino reluctantly persuaded by Voice of God Rickman to travel to New Jersey in the company of two unlikely prophets (Jason Mewes Jay and Smiths Silent Bob from the earlier films) in order to stop vengeful fallen angels Affleck and Damon destroying existence as we know it. Too talky too fond of in-jokes too caught up (especially during the dismally weak climax) in its crass comic-strip ethos and not finally as funny subversive or thought-provoking as it would like to be. Nor despite the hype is it outrageous - its no surprise to learn Smith is a practising Catholic.

Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are bad-boy angels out to regain their place in heaven. Smith conjures up a bickering party of apostles demons and prophets blending a seminarians fastidiousness with his own ragtag pop style--a fusion of comic books Howard Stern and amiably slovenly Gen-X tude. The movie in its very form is a manic act of transubstantiation. By the end the tensions have fused into a vision of transcendence and light.

Starring Ben Affleck Matt Damon Linda Fiorentino Alan Rickman and Chris Rock. Directed by Kevin Smith. (R. 125 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) There is nothing to compare to ""Dogma."" It is a one-of-a- kind film written and directed by Kevin Smith who made ""Chasing Amy"" two years ago and a couple of lesser pictures before that ""Clerks"" and ""Mall Rats."" Nothing in Smiths resume could prepare the viewer for this film. Sure ""Dogma"" sounds as if Smith wrote it. There are the reflexive and too-frequent references to pop culture and Smiths ubiquitous characters Jay and Silent Bob (the latter played by Smith himself) have important roles. But to say this is Smiths best film doesnt come close to saying enough. ""Dogma"" is mature thoughtful and occasionally dazzling. Its also a genuine work of faith. ""Dogma"" may be the most unlikely and unstuffy religious film ever made with plenty of crude language and lewd jokes. But its unmistakably a film made by a practicing Catholic. At a time when most serious art comes from an agnostic viewpoint Smiths playful but sincere mysticism is refreshing. Smiths previous films have confined themselves to small locations and situations but ""Dogma"" tells a big story involving broad stretches of territory and an array of characters. The catalysts if not the stars are two fallen angels played by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. After 2000 years in exile in Wisconsin they have discovered a loophole in church dogma that may allow them back into heaven if only they can pass under the arch at a Catholic church in New Jersey. The only problem If they pass under the arch they will undo all of creation. Still the idea goes anything to get out of the Midwest. Linda Fiorentino plays Bethany the woman chosen by God to stop the boys from crossing that threshold. A thundering voice and a ball of fire come to her in the middle of the night. She puts the fireball out with an extinguisher revealing a frustrated and long- suffering angel of God played by Alan Rickman. Talking about the story of ""Dogma"" cant convey the mis chief and inventiveness of Smiths script. Its smart and funny all the way. The energetic Chris Rock shows up as the 13th apostle claiming to have been left out of the New Testament because hes black. ""Jesus told me the secret of life at a wedding in Cana"" he says. ""But I got drunk and forgot it."" The picture also benefits from the breezy rapport of Affleck and Damon who really do seem like guys whove been hanging out together for thousands of years. We first meet them in an airport where Loki (Damon) causes a nun to doubt her faith. He knows better. He does it just for fun. Smiths juggling of tones -- from the silly to the reverent to the fantastic -- seems effortless and suggests a filmmaker with a steady grasp of his films overall vision. ""Dogma"" is hardly the work of a lightweight. He may have a kids sense of humor but Smith knows the Bible and is up on his philosophy. He is fortunate in having Fiorentino whose progress from confusion to faith keeps one foot grounded in reality at all times. Originally Smith considered casting pop star Alanis Morissette in the role but Morissette wasnt available. He got lucky. Morissette appears here in a much smaller role -- onscreen for no more than a few minutes -- and her amateurishness almost blows the one scene she is in. ..
