Whether or not this was a good idea seemed irrelevant it was a bestselling book with a timely inherently cinematic theme; the movie had to be made. The Proposition director John Hillcoats film is as direct and unflinching an adaptation as one could reasonably hope for. A man (Viggo Mortensen) and a boy (Kodi Smit-McPhee) wander the American wasteland after an unnamed ecological disaster. The trees are bare the animals dead the few human survivors starving desperate often violent occasionally monstrous.The Road is certainly the bleakest and potentially the least commercial product in recent Hollywood history. Both book and movie suffer from the same inherent weakness - they exist purely to make you miserable. Sure theres a smattering of subtext - a little eco-politics here a spot of family psychology there - but the central purpose is to break your heart and shatter your soul.On which level Hillcoats movie is a resounding triumph. Stunning landscape photography sets the melancholy mood and Nick Caves wrenching score reinforces it. But it is the performances that ultimately hold the film together. We expect this kind of selfless professionalism from Mortensen and McPhee is appropriately sad-eyed as his long-suffering son but its the incidental characters who steal the show notably Robert Duvall in a startling cameo which not only distils the films key themes into a single three-minute scene but singlehandedly lifts a potentially drab affair into something quietly impressive. Just dont expect to walk out smiling.

I couldve used my own imagination and imagined a much better story than this crap and not wasted my time watching it. If I were to imagine what caused the apocalypse of this movie I could think of hundreds likewise I could think of hundreds of possibilities of what happened after the end of the movie. The family could have truly been nice took the kid in and they couldve survived long enough for his kids to see a rebirth or his dad might have been paranoid for a good reason they might have taken him behind the next bush and slaughtered him. Such a wide range of possibilities is not for the purpose of ""leaving it to your imagination"" it is simply lazy writing. A well written story might not spell everything out for the viewer but it doesnt leave holes this big either. A well crafted story would give clues and leave the viewer to come up with a list of finite possible conclusions not an infinite scope of which the viewer might as well have crafted their own story from rather than trying to add this pointless piece into it. There is no point to trying to combine the viewers visions and the authors vision when it is this wide open. Doing so would be guaranteed to be apocryphal anyway.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJun 2 2012AlFeaturedOf course we can use our imagination.

As the father said ""Im leaving you exactly as you left us"" (with nothing). There are glimmers of hope in the film. The family at the end. The green bugs near the coast (so there is life out there besides the remaining humans). For those that like it all laid on the table - tough - youll have to fill in the gaps. We dont need to know why or how the apocalypse happened. The characters probably dont know so why should we? It just occurred to me that the family that was following them all along were heard above the shelter. I remember the child saying he heard a dog. Perhaps they had survived so well because that was their hideout or at least they had taken some of the food. If one was aware of an impending catastrophic event wouldnt you stock up a bomb-proof hideout in your garden? I liked the film. Bleak slow but thought provoking which is how it intends to be. I cant help but think those rating the film poorly missed the point.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 16 2011ObserverFeaturedWhy the big commotion about the thief being caught and stripped of his belongings?

The dog at the end survived because the family the boy meets represents a sort of civility and possibly a return to a normal pre-disaster way of life-- at least in their minds. While everyone else was eating their pets this family chose to take a ""path of good"". Also the dog might be new to the group as well and when he arrived the family was no longer in a tribal community (as implied by the fathers missing thumb). Anyway... The whole movie is about the kid showing compassion and mercy to others-- regardless. From what others have said this is an interpretation of a biblical story in which God helps the boy. I dont know for sure but it makes sense.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 17 2010IdletimeFeaturedI have to add my 2 cents.

Also the ending was an issue. Some people have argued that it is highly unlikely that a starving family would still have a dog - however i ask you. could you eat your pet dog and if a canibal tried to eat your pet dog would you not fight tooth and nail to save it? Additionally I dont feel the need to know what has happened to the world - if the film explained this it could become one of those scince-fiction type films like the day after tomorrow. There are loads of films like ththat which focus on big budget action sequences and it is quiet refreshing anf thought provoking to have a film that focuses on the human sie of the situationation by looking at the relationship betwen a man and is son.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyNov 23 2010j elseyFeaturedI can sympathise with those reviewers who found the film depressing but is it over-sentimental?

The charecter of the father is not idiotic he is a fallible man like most of us and misguided in whathe has to do to remain good in this world. the whole point of the narrative is that hes wrong to fear everyone in the world and at the end we are offered a little sliver of hope. there really would be no point if it ended when he died as it is his death frees the son to live andtrust in his own way rather than carrying the fire in his fathers way alone. i still find the 1 star reveiws mystifying. The disaster remains unexplained as do their lives before the disaster allowing us to engage our imaginations and speculate about this for ourselves its the chief strength of both movie and novel. So its not onefor those who want to be spoonfed or crave neat endings or require explanation to satisfy them but its still a beautiful spare human tale about a father son relationship in a world gone to hell. Its difficult but i cant understnd the lack of sophistication in some reveiwers hee who seem to want evryoneto be unfallible heroic and always right. how mny people are like that in real life? i would still however much i like the film urge anyone who did enjoy i to read the book however as it really is a modern classic. i wish the filmmakers had just followed it a bit more closely although that would mean een more walkng searching for food and circularity. Thir life is a grind. Its survival. many people are forcedto live in a similar way when they become refugees in war zones and many of them dont understand what caused their situation to be so bleak either. I originally red it wen travelling through an extremly poor african country and it really did reflect what i saw going on around me in a very profound way. Cormac cCarthys genius is to take what is happening to large numbers of peopl around the world every day and to find a way to relate that back to America.

The movie at its core focused on the existential heroes embarking upon a hopeless journey through a naturalistic world. The world was violent barren and devoid of hope yet these characters continued to carry the fire. (Both metaphysical fire and physical fire were important to the central theme. Physical fire kept them alive physically and metaphysical fire kept them fighting on. ) The only part that i felt was disappointing in the film was the ending. papa dies and everything is better when the boy meets the family? how does this union make everything better? is this a physical manifestation of hope? or a reward for constant perseverance? maybe they will be eaten by zombie-like cannibal or live happily ever after? i wish that the movie just ended with the death of the fatherFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 29 2010MycerinFeaturedThis film wasnt as good nor as bad as I had anticipated.

It basically consists of two interchanging scenes which repeat multiple times over the course of two hours. On one scene the father and his boy go around traveling in empty roads and sleeping in deserted cars while having occasional memories from which the father will suddenly wake up from in a jerky and annoying fashion. And on the other scene they witness psychopath gangs which are out to kill them and other people in a putrid and bloody fashion. These two scenes pretty much interchange and repeat in cycles but it is done in such way that there is no progress whatsoever. Rarely the father and son will encounter another homeless person and so you get your hopes up that the movie is actually going somewhere but over and over again the movie brings your hopes up and lets you down as the they part ways and nothing is resolved. Then the movie keeps on interchanging the two scenes just like before. For starters it seems the whole world is destroyed but from the very beginning of the movie it is never revealed what caused the world disaster or how the father and his kid survived it...and I dont know about you but if the whole world was destroyed Id like to know HOW. Worst of all the movie is shot in a really cruddy way. During many scenes the camera was zoomed way into the characters faces as to avoid filming the natural sky and surroundings--- but when they do show you the surroundings it becomes obvious that they are using a special filter to make the green-and-blue scenery look less colorful (black and white almost) and to tone down any sunlight being captured in the filming process. Its really poor quality special effects. There was a part or two where the filmmakers ""made a boo-boo"" since you could clearly see sunshine (and there was not supposed to be any in the so-called post-apocalyptic scenery). It was clearly being toned down to make the scene look more stark and it was not easy on the eyes and poorly executed. The final straw watching this movie is that after two hours of patiently tolerating two repeating scenes no progress in story line and poor camera filters the ending that you wait breathlessly for turns out to make no sense whatsoever. Supposedly a group composed of a woman a man two children and a dog (a dog? come on) show up out of nowhere right on time after the boys father dies and claim that they have been following them ""all along"". But thats ridiculous. In reality they would have caught up to them immediately and robbed them of their food for their own survival What a disappointment I wasted two hours of my life burning my eyes in a state of anxiety but you dont have to.

Worst of all the movie is shot in a really cruddy way zooming in overly close up into the characters faces as to avoid filming the natural sky and surroundings--- but when they do show you the surroundings it becomes obvious that they are using a special filter to make the scenery look less colorful and to tone down any sunlight being captured in the filming process. Its really poor quality special effects. The father is the most idiotic character you could imagine. He does the dumbest things like leaving his kid alone in obviously dangerous situations forces a guy to strip naked in front of his kid and at one point cocks a gun at his own kids head (on-skin contact) while the little kid whimpers and cries incoherently before the people-eating people come. The whole movie is a worse than a lemon no--worse than a fiasco no--it was a piece of shit.

Would u rather see yr child be slowly butchered amp; limbs amputated to eat by cannibals or would u show him a quick amp; easy way to not have to suffer such a fate? I have kids amp; definately would choose the latter. Pople are mentioning 2012 because that was a movie ALSO about the Apocolypse but actually managed to make it look like good fun rather than the harrowing event which Id bet it wud be as portayed inThe Road. Like I said u dont have much life experience. Firstly he didnt throw away the wedding ring he threw her picture. This was his way of emoting his anger at his wife on walking out on them but he didnt throw the ring because he knew he did love her for all the time they were together amp; didnt throw the ring over the bridge but just left it there. The hobo stripping? Set against the situation they were in seeing a naked body was no big deal for the boy also this showed how his focus and purpose in life was to keep his son alive amp; if that meant robbing someones clothes then so be it. Viggo had no other function left in life than survival amp; t any cost. The evil gang scenes? This wasnt a movie about just surviving zombies like some sort of texas chainsaw massacre movie it was about survival full stop.By the terrible ending I suppose u mean the boy going off with this family against what his father had taught him? 2 things. Firstly since everyone who didnt like this movie because it was too blek amp; depressing this ending provided a bit of hope amp; secondly it showed regardless of what his father taught him deep down the boy still believed in the good in people amp; went with this in the end. This is what was portrayed througought this movie.

"The Road Struggle for redemption smartly told | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Road Struggle for redemption smartly toldHow could anything so bleak be so promising?In The Road father and son Viggo Mortensen and Kodi Smit-McPhee grapple with a world where civilization has been replaced by cannibalism.  (THE WEINSTEIN COMPANY RELEASE)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Nov. 27 2009Starring Viggo Mortensen Kodi Smit-McPhee Charlize Theron and Robert Duvall. Directed by John Hillcoat. 110 minutes. At major theatres. 14AHow could anything so bleak be so promising?The postapocalyptic America painted in the opening lines of Cormac McCarthys The Road now masterfully brought to the screen by John Hillcoat (The Proposition) brings a catch to the throat ""Nights dark beyond darkness and the days more grey each one that what had gone before. Like the onset of some cold glaucoma dimming away the world.""And yet even when hope has been exhausted there is always love. This is what sustains us in watching the struggles of Viggo Mortensen and Kodi Smit-McPhee as an anonymous father and son raging against the dying of the light. We have no real reason to expect a positive outcome. The world has been nearly shorn of life by an unnamed but likely man-caused calamity. Article Continued BelowYet we marvel at the bond between parent and child and their determination to keep ""carrying the fire"" for as long as they can. The Road is a horror movie - cannibalism has replaced civilization - but its an uncommonly smart and deep one. Theres an Old Testament directness to McCarthys prose which screenwriter Joe Penhall has faithfully adapted and also a Biblical sense of rough justice what man has sown so must he reap.The story picks up from the sheriffs surreal dream in McCarthys previous novel No Country for Old Men which the Coen Bros. parlayed into an unlikely box-office and Oscar hit. Recall what another lawman had told the sheriff earlier in the tale ""You cant stop whats coming; thats vanity."" What was coming in No Country has fully arrived in The Road. Watching it I am reminded of Georges Franjus Thomas the Impostor set in a devastated France during World War I and the famous scene in which a white horse tears across a ruined landscape its mane and tail ablaze. Yet The Road is even more fearsome because it contains no life even as vivid as that terrified animal just humans grimly attempting to carry on.But why do they bother? A prologue with Charlize Theron as the practical wife sets up the them-or-us scenario either you choose suicide or you choose to be raped and then eaten by the cannibal gangs that roam the darkness.She has made her choice. The father and son are now making theirs which involves heading south to escape the constant cold and possibly to find signs of restoration.Theres a hint the father lacked resolve early in the slow-moving devastation but that has been replaced by steely determination to protect his son at all costs. He carries a pistol loaded with two bullets. Choice No. 1 still remains if it comes to that. There are other people on the road including an old tramp played by an almost unreadable Robert Duvall and no one can be trusted.Its instructive to see what can be done with a few well-designed scenes including one in a remote house that is straight out of the horror handbook. On a budget that was a fraction of the kings ransom paid to make Roland Emmerichs apocalyptic cartoon 2012 Hillcoat and cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe have conjured much more fearsome vistas of devastation all the more so for their unseen cause.A movie this austere like a stage play by Samuel Beckett or Thornton Wilder demands much of its actors. American journeyman Mortensen and Australian newcomer Smit-McPhee are more than up to the task delivering award-worthy performances as flawed yet redeemable humans.That Mortensen and Smit-McPhee are required to be on the screen for almost all of the films 110-minute running time is further testament to their talent and to their ability to convincingly portray a father and son coping with crisis. Making this movie was as demanding physically as it was mentally.By degree the trudging pair realizes that the task is not so much one of survival but of proving that even in the midst of the most terrible of conditions humanity and love must prevail. If theres a message to The Road never a sure thing with McCarthys scorched intellect this is surely it.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

The planet has gone cold after an unexplained apocalypse that killed the flora the fauna and most of the spectrum (though the sickly light from a blighted sun does manage to produce one wan rainbow). Not that many people populate the film--mainly a father and son slogging across a slag-heap American landscape and subsisting on what shreds of food they can find while trying not to become protein for other survivors whove descended into cannibalism. Normally you give yourself to a movie suspending disbelief. In this one you hang on to yourself for dear life resisting belief as best you can in the face of powerful acting persuasive filmmaking and the perversely compelling certainty that nothing will turn out all right. Watch a scene from ""The Road."" Adapted from the novel by Cormac McCarthy the film follows a man (Viggo Mortensen) and his son (Kodi Smit-McPhee) as they wander the highways of post-apocalyptic America. Video courtesy of The Weinstein Company. The man played by Viggo Mortensen doesnt have a name because Cormac McCarthys novel didnt give him one. Mr. Mortensen gives him a gaunt grandeur--it doesnt hurt that the actors face can evoke paintings of Christ without a muscle being moved--and an emotional spectrum that is muted but remarkably wide considering the characters plight and the authors spare style. The mans young son terrified by a cataclysm he cant comprehend but still capable of sweet optimism and kindness is played by Kodi Smit-McPhee. Between the two performances theres not a false note. Between the father and son theres an unbreakable bond. Though civilization has ended love and parental duty shape the course of this fable which is otherwise as heartwarming as a Beckett play shorn of humor. Hollywoods Favorite Cowboy Author Cormac McCarthy talks about the movie based on his novel ""The Road."" ""Whatever it takes"" is the mans mantra--whatever it takes to survive to protect his son to teach the boy how to survive on his own. His parenting is reduced to elementals in a world reduced to savagery. Yet parents teach by example so the fable grows complex when a brief encounter with a starving old man presents an ethical dilemma--let him starve as the father wants to do or follow the boys impulse to give him food. (Robert Duvall finds fleeting poetry in the old mans attempt to talk about his own son.) This is not ""On the Beach"" suffused by a sense of regret and mournful surrender but its not exactly musical comedy; the ill winds are icy and incessant. The director John Hillcoat working from an adaptation by Joe Penhall severely rations our glimpses of life bathed in blessedly bright sunlight as it was before a piano duet played by two hands one large and one small; a portrait in jagged fragments of the wife and mother--shes played with eloquence and passion by Charlize Theron--who couldnt weather the worst of the storm. For the most part ""The Road"" is a strip mall of horrors relieved only by occasional interludes of better fortune during which the father and son find nourishment temporary safety or brief comfort. (Javier Aguirresarobe was the cinematographer. Nick Cave and Warren Ellis did the lovely music an unlikely combination of medieval and Appalachian.) ENLARGE Viggo Mortensen as a desperate father with Kodi Smit-McPhee as his beloved son in The Road. Dimension Films Will all of this bleakness find an audience? Maybe so. The theme of unswerving love is strong. The spectacle of a blasted planet holds a fateful attraction. A beautician who saw a preview told me how much shed been moved by a scene in which the man and boy find a way to wash their hair with warm water and shampoo and whos to say her perspective is skewed; at the very least the movie makes us grateful for the comforts we have. Still watching this production and reading the book are vastly different experiences. The book challenges the reader to find the feelings buried in the prose (after challenging the reader to stay with a story that first seems like a dogged exercise in finding different ways to express grim and gray). The conversations between the boy and man are so minimalist as to border on maddening yet theyre charged with suppressed emotion. For better or worse the book demands work and rewards it with an acute sense of existential dread. The movie being a movie bears inevitable resemblances to other postapocalyptic movies including those enlivened by crazed bikers or zombies. Yet ""The Road"" to its great credit hews closely to the books vision. And it spares us the culinary details of cannibalism--no small favor under the circumstances. Me and Orson Welles Richard Linklaters ""Me and Orson Welles"" a cheerfully fatuous coming of age comedy was adapted from a novel by Robert Kaplow. The setting is New York in 1937. Thats when the preposterously precocious Welles at the age of 22 was directing his Mercury Theater production of ""Julius Caesar"" a daring adaptation set in fascist Italy. Strictly speaking Welles isnt the movies central character; the Me of the ungrammatical title is Richard Samuels (Zac Efron) a high school student who inveigles Welles into casting him as the lute-playing Lucius. Still Welles is Welles. He was always at the center of everything and he certainly is here. Whats more hes played by an excellent English actor Christian McKay who bears or somehow simulates a facial resemblance to the great man and nails Welless expression of pouty aggrieved amusement. But Mr. McKay is in his mid-30s and doesnt conceal it so whats the point? By taking the kind out of wunderkind the movie also removes the wunder. ENLARGE Christian McKay at center as Orson Welles in Me and Orson Welles. CinemaNX Films One Limited For those who care less about Orson Welles and more about the heart-throbby Mr. Efron the point is clear put the young star of Disneys ""High School Musical"" (who just turned 22 himself) into a nostalgic period piece and give him a chance to develop his acting chops. But Mr. Efrons fix on the period suggests a GPS struggling in a low-signal area and the movie becomes an affectionate name-dropping exercise in historical mutilation. Among the members of the Mercury Theater John Houseman is played by Eddie Marsan Joseph Cotten is played by James Tupper and Norman Lloyd is played by Leo Bill. Mr. Lloyd who was born one year before Orson Welles is an irrepressible raconteur and an endlessly zestful observer of the movie scene. I dare not imagine what hell think of ""Me and Orson Welles."" Though no I dare. DVD FOCUS The Gleaners and I (2000) ENLARGE They arent the father and son of ""The Road"" living on scraps of food and the occasional banquet of canned goods but the scavengers recyclers and dumpster-divers in Agnes Vardas surprising documentary live off the land in their own fashion. Ms. Varda the influential director of such French-language features as ""Cleo From 5 to 7"" and ""Le Bonheur"" was inspired by Jean-Francois Millets 1857 painting Les Glaneuses. Her mission was to find contemporary equivalents of the three peasant women in the painting searching for grains of wheat in an already harvested field. In finding them she found herself. Mad Max (1979) ENLARGE At the age of 23 an American-born Aussie named Mel Gibson burst upon the world as the motorcycle cop Max Rockatansky in George Millers dazzling violent and endlessly influential postapocalyptic action fantasy. The dramatic engine is revenge. When a biker gang of lascivious psychopaths murders Maxs family--after all these years the sequence is still shocking--he goes after them with all the weapons and wiles at his command. The setting is Australias Outback where the chases like the roads seem limitless. David Eggby did the cinematography and the director worked from a script he wrote with James McCausland. School of Rock (2003) ENLARGE Richard Linklater previously known for such slacker comedies as ""Dazed and Confused"" and the genre-defining ""Slacker"" directed this joyous farce--from a script by Mike White--about a scruffy rocker passing himself off as a pedagogue and turning a bunch of rigid preteens into a rock band for the ages. The star is Jack Black whose anarchic musician is a monster of antic id a poster child for the bright side of sociopathy and a wailing dervish with a false falsetto and a mock-Mephistophelean mien.

Starring Viggo Mortensen Kodi Smith-McPhee Charlize Theron Guy Pearce Robert Duvall Michael K. Williams Director John Hillcoat Running time 153 Release Opened Nov 25 2009  Editorial Review The Road Been there done this post-apocalyptic reckoningBy Ann HornadayWednesday November 25 2009A great film has been made about a father and son who embark on an arduous journey of self-discovery filial bonding and profound moral reckoning set against a grim backdrop of post-apocalyptic misery.Its called ""District 9"" and it will be available on DVD in a few weeks.As for ""The Road"" the highly anticipated and much-delayed adaptation of the Cormac McCarthy novel it too aspires to greatness. And in many ways it succeeds as it brings to bleak life McCarthys story of an unnamed man and boy trying to survive a catastrophe of unknown origin with their bodies and souls intact. Director John Hillcoat who made an astonishing U.S. debut with the Australian western ""The Proposition"" in 2005 brings all his visual and imaginative powers to bear in creating a desaturated landscape of abandoned homes deserted freeways and charred trees that topple over as if from sheer spiritual exhaustion. The only living things to be found are roving bands of survivors who have turned to cannibalism or as in the case of ""The Roads"" two anonymous protagonists those who steadfastly refuse to eat people and instead forage for what they can glean from the odd soda machine or still-intact pantry.Viggo Mortensen delivers a haunting sensitive portrayal of a father determined to shepherd his son (Kodi Smit-McPhee) to safety toward the coast where its warm. As the duo make their way through a world turned grim and gray the father comes to see the boy as a kind of spiritual avatar. ""If he isnt the word of God then God never spoke"" he intones in a voiceover. Looking like a cadaverous Civil War soldier from a Mathew Brady daguerreotype Mortensens character occasionally flashes back to the moment the plague hit when his wife (Charlize Theron) gave birth to their child then came to her own grievous decisions about their future. ""The Road"" is one long dirge a keening lamentation marking the death of hope and the leeching of all that is bright and good from the world.""Were the good guys"" the boy says repeating one of the lessons from his fathers ongoing course of moral instruction whereby one is either a good guy or a bad guy and carries ""the fire"" within or doesnt. Presumably fans of McCarthys novel will be well pleased with the care and somber respect Hillcoat and his cast bring to ""The Road"" which deserves praise for its ambition tonal control and stark visual design. But like ""No Country for Old Men"" its possible to admire ""The Road"" and still harbor deep misgivings about how much technical and artistic virtuosity are being thrown at an essentially thin hopelessly mannered story.Stripped of his tough plainspoken prose McCarthy traffics in emotions every bit as highly pitched as the most lurid melodrama. He loves to put his characters -- and by extension the audience -- in situations of unbearable suffering to see if theyre worthy of his exacting ethical standards. Hes a stylishly austere sadist. After Mortensens character and the boy narrowly escape death at the hand of yet another flesh-eating wraith viewers may be forgiven for wishing for ""No Countrys"" Anton Chigurh to show up with his stun gun and put all of us out of our misery.As a spiritual allegory ""The Road"" aims to celebrate moral clarity in the face of nihilistic despair a sense of right and wrong here reflected in a childs instinctive love of justice and compassion. Its a beautiful idea poetically conveyed in the service of thoroughly undeserving source material. ""The Road"" possesses undeniable sweep and a grim kind of grandeur but it ultimately plays like a zombie movie with literary pretensions. The Road -- (113 minutes at Regal Gallery Place Landmark Bethesda Row and Fairfax Corner) is rated R for violence disturbing images and profanity.

Some movies you watch others you feel"" ran a 1980s ad campaign. Still others you withstand. Black bleak and tiresomely blunt ""The Road"" a reverent adaptation of the Cormac McCarthy novel about a father and son wandering across America after an unspecified catastrophe has nearly blotted out humanity doesnt offer plot or an inquiry into the evil in mens hearts. It simply wallows in the filth and inhumanity that surround a father (Viggo Mortensen) and his pre-adolescent son (Kodi Smit-McPhee) as they march across the shattered remains of this country. They meet and dodge a variety of hopeless and vicious characters including members of an aggressive gang interested in serving man -- for dinner. ""Zombieland"" was the same movie with laughs but if you take away the comedy what is left? Nothing on a vast scale. ""The Road"" overflows with nullity. Picture a black canvas on a crumbling wall in a forlorn museum. Director John Hillcoat (""The Proposition"") has effectively re-created the horrors of the Pulitzer Prize novel. But its one that should not have been brought to the screen. Hillcoats misspent skillfulness means squirming through a scene that while awful enough in the book on-screen is too hideous to consider though in McCarthys vision it makes perfect awful sense. Lets just say that starving people would do a lot to survive. We learn in flashback that the Mortensen characters wife (Charlize Theron) saw no better option than suicide. Youll be wondering why the boy and the man dont take the same way out. The only thing that seems to keep them going is that theyre characters in a movie and they need to fill up some running time by for instance chatting with a desperate old man (the encrusted remains of Robert Duvall). A situation and a series of incidents dont equal a story though which is why the book was so glaringly flawed. Who wants a date with agony? An absurd and dishonest happy ending cant be the reason for this movies gruesome rigors. Nor does ""The Road"" leave you feeling gratitude at your relative comforts. There isnt a moral lesson or a spiritual one or a philosophical one or a political one though this last factor might be counted an advantage. At least were spared a lecture about how we deserved all this. The only purpose I can detect in the smoldering wreckage is simple masochism; some people like to take a beating and others like to spend two hours cloaked in the most piteous distress. File ""The Road"" under apocalypse porn. Unlike ""Wall-E"" and ""Children of Men"" though this one offers no hope of renewal no exit from the hell it so persuasively depicts.

Hoberman Viggo Mortensens The Road Takes Path of Least Resistance Tuesday November 24 2009 at 4 a.m. By J. Hoberman 1 Viggo want food.Javier Aguirresarobe A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - The Road Cormac McCarthys Pulitzer Prize-winning Oprah-endorsed post-apocalyptic survivalist prose poem--in which a father and his 10-year-old son traverse a despoiled landscape of unspeakable horror--was a quick lacerating read. John Hillcoats literal adaptation which arrives one Thanksgiving past its original release date is by contrast a long dull slog.Taken as a Hail Mary flung from the Weinstein Company bunker The Road has a certain pragmatic integrity. (While aimed at the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences its being strategically released by the Weinsteins genre label Dimension.) Fidelity to the material is not the problem. On the contrary. Freezing starving and dodging cannibal marauders The Man (earnest increasingly Christlike Viggo Mortensen) and The Boy (stolidly whimpering Kodi Smit-McPhee) follow the novels keep-on-keepin-on trajectory (apparently to Floridas Gold Coast) ""carrying the fire"" of human decency as well as a gun loaded with two suicide bullets.As a director Hillcoat is certainly credentialed to handle this unpleasant saga. The Proposition his 2006 Australian outback oater was a savagely miserablist tale set in a dry-gulch hellhole of ferocious carnage. Although mildly sanitized The Road has its grim frissons--as when The Man and The Boy escape The Redneck Slaughterhouse of Terror or discover The Last Can of Coke. But theres a bizarre absence of dramatic tension. One can either embrace McCarthys laconic tone or ignore it--Hillcoat does neither. For all the added bad-guy assaults or earthquake-induced Attack of the Falling Trees his Road never eludes its weighty pedigree--pale by comparison to an action thriller like Children of Men or gross out eco-catastrophe like Land of the Dead squandering its ready-made zombie scenario. Where McCarthy was free to focus on how a post-human world might feel Hillcoat is compelled to illustrate these impressions and organize them into a coherent narrative.Perhaps only a visionary genius like Andrei Tarkovsky or a heedless schlockmeister like Michael Bay could have handled the books combination of visceral terror and mystical reflection. Ultimately Hillcoats The Road is less a disaster (or post-disaster) flick than a sort of global death trip--intended possibly as an audience ordeal in the tradition of The Passion of the Christ complete with redemptive ending and regularly articulated life lessons. All meetings on the road are potential parables every repetitive exchange between The Man and The Boy is presented as a mantra and the appearance of a rheumy putrid Old Man provides a gabby cameo for guest star Robert Duvall.The Roads long and winding path to the multiplex might make a more fascinating saga than the movie itself. That the 2008 version was evidently deemed too bleak for audience consumption may account for the presence of Mortensens lugubrious voiceover croon and the ruminative keyboard doodling used to soften every other scene. In addition to the obtrusive Nick Cave and Warren Ellis score The Boys dead mother who regularly appears in The Mans thoughts in the tawny distracted form of Charlize Theron is at one point playing the piano.Other memories of Life Before include gauzy close-ups of flowers trees and the family horse. The latter is a nice touch although my favorite addition to the novel is the close-up of The Post-Apocalyptic Puppy of Hope that appears in the movies final scene. Its a last-minute Christmas card reminiscent of the voiceover that opens Sam Fullers Vietnam-set China Gate ""In this ravaged city where people are starving all the dogs have been eaten except one.""jhobermanvillagevoice.com Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact J.

(Dimension Films) Joe Neumaier Wednesday November 25 2009 107 AM Title If you like pop in your apocalypse theres ""2012"" still in theaters. But for a more thoughtful less bombastic film experience about the late great Planet Earth and its inhabitants theres ""The Road"" the polar opposite of the seasons other Armageddon movie. This adaptation of Cormac McCarthys 2006 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel is intense and yes depressing - and earns every minute that it rattles inside your head.Still be warned This is one of the toughest trips to the movies this year. Some 10 years after an unexplained event brings the end of the world as we know it a man (Viggo Mortensen) and his son (Kodi Smit-McPhee) travel through the ruins of the American South scrounging for food and shelter. Theyre hoping to make it to the Atlantic coast where they think there may be a chance of survival. With no food supply left no animals no plants and sunlight blocked out by gray ash the only sustenance available is humans. To survive the majority has turned to cannibalism. As predators they roam smoldering landscapes looking for prey (often resembling photographs of defeated Confederate soldiers). As the man and boy - we never hear their names - get closer to the coast and its vague promises they repeat to each other that theyre ""the good guys."" That part is true yet comes with complications McCarthys point is that isolationism is the natural instinct we have to fear most. Coming across an elderly traveler (Robert Duvall) the boy reminds his tentative exhausted dad that good guys help when they can. Mortensens mesmerizing performance is rawboned full of fatherly fierceness and a single-minded determination to protect his only child born just as the world slid toward darkness. His attempts at a primal normalcy are heartbreaking such as when the two draw images by a dying fire or find a place as close to safe as theyll come. Smit-McPhee shouldering the trickier role avoids the standard ""feral child"" cliches. Raised in fear and without his mother (Charlize Theron seen in flashbacks) hes wary though open and director John Hillcoat and screenwriter Joe Penhall are smart to not bury the character with too much savior symbolism. ""The Road"" was originally due out last year at this time but was delayed because of studio strategy and narrative fiddling. Now the fluke of timing makes this episodic story an antidote to the caffeinated ""2012."" But there are better comparisons such as to Rod Serling Stephen King and the recent ""Children of Men."" But this films unique near-total bleakness is something to admire. As a parable about death and a kind of global homelessness ""The Road"" leads to some extraordinary places.A father and son struggle to survive the end of the world.

"The Road reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up The Road reviewed. The Road reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 25 2009 1012 AM The Road Prepare to be bludgeoned. By Dana Stevens Viggo Mortensen in The Road The Man and The Boy went down the road. Down it in the book as in the film the film kilning up out of the book and making it visible. Expanse of wreck and slag after the worst has come. Not in words now but pictures. Can you do it? Tell the story that cant be told. Yet tell it you must. The Boy and Man on the road nameless in the long-dead world. Their cart and tarp and tins of food sole bulwark against the growing cold. Stark tale of human love against the gray scrim of ruin. When the time comes can you film it? Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. There are limits to what the human mind and heart can endure especially when it comes to my Cormac McCarthy impersonation from which I will now desist. John Hillcoats The Road (Dimension Films) a largely faithful adaptation of McCarthys novel takes place like the book almost entirely at those mind/heart limits. Its a horror film that operates at the most primal level activating that infantile or simian region of our brain that compels us to bond with other human beings to seek their protection and offer our own. McCarthy is a spelunker of the human psyche and in The Road he takes the reader in with him and threatens to abandon her in the depths. Because of the extreme nature of its subject matter Hillcoats The Road is likewise a shattering experience You walk out of the theater sweaty and shaking. But does extreme experience equal great art? Advertisement The Man (Viggo Mortensen) and The Boy (Kodi Smit-McPhee) are the only real characters in this tale of post-apocalyptic survival and father-son love. The people they encounter on their agonizing slog to ""the coast""--here as in many future-dystopic narratives the imagined site of some possible rescue--are vague shadows barely people at all. After some unnamed catastrophe most human life and all animal and plant life has been wiped from the face of the earth. Those people who remain have no common bond no social contract. Roving bands of cannibals hunt down and eat anyone weak enough to become their prey. Here and there noncannibalistic refugees--the people The Boy calls ""the good guys""--can be found wandering through the waste but its impossible to tell who is who so The Man and The Boy trust no one. Occasionally The Man dreams of his prior life the days before the disaster when he fell in love with his wife (Charlize Theron seen only in flashbacks) or the days just after when she gave birth to their first child in a world newly devoid of hope. But as he warns The Boy saddening dreams at least prove youre still struggling to survive. Its the good dreams you need to worry about. ""A world newly devoid of hope""--see its hard to write about this film without slipping into bleaker-than-thou Cormac-isms. Watching The Boy and The Man wend their way through this awful featureless landscape (shot in deliberately ugly monochrome) is grueling harrowing spiritually draining--but the same could be said about watching pigs get slaughtered for two hours. The Road is an undifferentiated parade of horrors; you watch from between clenched hands but each new atrocity overwrites the last like the next room in some cruel funhouse ride. For everything the movie gets right--most notably the impressively pared-down script by Joe Penhall and the two truthful and fearless performances from Mortensen and McPhee--theres a corresponding painful blunder like the overwrought score from Nick Cave and Warren Ellis. The Australian singer-songwriter is a friend and collaborator of Hillcoats and his score does everything that Penhalls austere script doesnt. Instead of countering McCarthys occasional tendency to excess the music reinforces it. Situations that we already have the good sense to feel awful about--protecting ones son from marauding flesh-eaters passing a row of skulls impaled on sticks coughing blood into the snow--are gooped up with sawing string music. Therons character its established early on was a pianist; her absence would register as more painful if every scene involving her didnt feature a plinking piano in the background. Without giving away the ending (oh God the ending) I can say that The Road is a movie that makes only the most minimal of concessions to its audiences need for redemption. Though the movie takes place in a recognizable movie universe--future dystopia meets zombie thriller Mad Max without the tricked-out cars--it deliberately withholds the catharsis we expect from genre films. Unless youre far better at walling yourself off from identification than I am you walk out in a state of untreated shock. Rather than thinking about the movie afterward you wait for it to wear off. In a way despite its unremitting grimness The Road is a perfect Thanksgiving weekend release. It gives even those who dread seeing their families for holiday dinner something very literal and tangible to be thankful for. Moms turkey may be dry and her pie crusts leathery but at least you have something to eat and someone to eat it with and the menu doesnt include you.

A father and son (Viggo Mortensen left and Kodi Smit-McPhee) deal with the violence and horror of the end of the world in The Road. Photo 2929/DIMENSION FILMS The Road 1 / 1 Back to Gallery My but its been a fine year for Armageddon. Since March weve witnessed the death of humanity -- or darn close to it -- in Knowing Terminator Salvation 9 Zombieland and 2012. The Road is only the latest and it wont be the last but its the most chilling so far. Not coincidentally its the only one based on a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by one of our greatest living authors. You should read the book. There I said it. True director John Hillcoat and screenwriter Joe Penhall deserve some kudos for this torturously faithful adaptation -- which like the novel looks at paternal devotion amid ashen skies and unspeakable horrors. Like the novel its simultaneously bleak and beautiful a tear-jerking dystopian fable that holds a gun to the head of a child and calls it love. But the movies bleaker. The books more beautiful. Thats about it. Dont heap too much blame on Hillcoat (The Proposition) or Javier Aguirresarobe whose washed-out cinematography paints the post-apocalypse landscape in depressive shades of gray. Thats the world Cormac McCarthy described in The Road and its the world on view here. But actually seeing it -- actually watching a knot of naked bloody captives alive but hacked apart by redneck cannibals -- is a heck of a lot harder than reading about it no matter how graphic the language or how discreetly its captured on film. Cannibals are a not-uncommon feature in this grim near-future where a world-ending calamity (only alluded to in flashbacks) has killed off almost everything that breathes. The bulk of the movie like the bulk of the book follows an unnamed man (Viggo Mortensen) and an unnamed boy (Kodi Smit-McPhee) who slog vaguely south along scorched fields and byways. Every now and then a stranger comes along perhaps threatening to eat the boy perhaps not. Every now and then the man and the boy find something to eat. Every now and then the man instructs his son in how to kill himself. See what I mean? Bleak. Yet this difficult visually drab and frequently hideous story is limned with tenderness -- crosshatched like fine gold thread into the films darkest fabric. It involves not just the love of the man for the boy but his conviction against all odds that the boy carries a spark of hope into the future. ""All I know is the child is my warrant"" he says in narration. ""And if he is not the word of God then God never spoke."" (None too surprisingly the film is being marketed to Christians.) An old hand at heroes (The Lord of the Rings) and enigmas (Eastern Promises) Mortensen delivers a performance of pure agonized transparency. He and Smit-McPhee arent alone onscreen (look for Robert Duvall as an old man with cataracts Guy Pearce as a latecomer and Charlize Theron as Mortensens absent wife) but the intensity of their bond commands the movie. Its quiet inviolability burns like ""the fire"" the man claims they carry. Thats the best you could ask I guess of a film based on McCarthys gorgeous ghastly masterpiece.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post In the after-the-apocalypse tale ""The Road"" the central characters called the Man and the Boy enter a deserted barn. Bodies hang from the rafters. The father and his young son have an exchange. ""Why?"" the boy asks. ""You know why"" his father replies. The father in this unrelenting adaptation of Cormac McCarthys more generous Pulitzer Prize-winning fable about parental love in an abject world is played by Viggo Mortensen. His young son is portrayed by Australian Kodi Smit-McPhee. It turns out the boy does and does not understand the reasons for the group suicide. And the difference between knowledge and hope -- the adult and kid versions -- is one of the insightful tensions of ""The Road."" The world has met a terrible fate. It may be nuclear or environmental or cosmic. The movie like the novel remains mum. One thing for certain The end was radical. Cities are rubble. Highways are gray ribbons with hulls of cars and tractor-trailers. Australian director John Hillcoat devotedly captures a scorched still- smoldering landscape. As the Man and the Boy make their way toward the coast the terrain shudders beneath them in seismic death rattles. Trees are stripped bare. There is no green. It is perpetual fall not autumn. What Hillcoat is less effective at at is presenting a compassionate vision. This is a willfully skillfully crafted film with insufficient heart to the task it undertakes. It never fully connects us to love amid its ruins. A recurring word used in reviews of Hillcoats bloodletting Aussie Western ""The Proposition"" (positive or critical) was ""pitiless."" It holds for this film too. It has brutality but not benevolence. ""The Road"" R for violence disturbing images and language. 1 hour 53 minutes. Directed by John Hillcoat; written by Joe Penhall; from the book by Cormac McCarthy; photography by Javier Aguirresarobe; starring Viggo Mortensen Kodi Smit-McPhee Charlize Theron Robert Duvall Guy Pearce Michael Kenneth Williams Garret Dillahunt Molly Parker. Opens today at area theaters. There are aching human touches. The boy wears his mothers knit hat pulled down over his ears. He clutches a stuffed elephant and keeps a little stock of knickknacks. These are artifacts in the museum of his young memory. Charlize Theron appears as the Mans wife the Boys mother. The Man is cursed with what can only be called ""lightmares."" He awakes from sun-drenched images of his life before the disaster with a start the way any of us might jerk conscious to protect ourselves from the visual burdens of slumber. The Boy was born into the disaster. In fact his mother resisted his birth. And its clear from flashbacks she was ready to take their lives earlier than the Man was. Now the Man carries a gun with two bullets one for each of them. Now the father and son travel as two. They are not alone in this harrowing world. ""The Road"" is populated by characters from peculiarly American horror flicks. Survivors of what has felled our planet roam in gangs -- armed hungry mean. Hillcoat could find few more dedicated partners in this grim undertaking than Mortensen. Theres nary a gram of vanity to his turn. Hes a truth seeker. In mining for the authentic he makes the Man a complex but hardly admirable figure. He reads to the boy by firelight. Its a reinstituting of a moral code. That they carry the human torch sounds good. But theres little evidence of the possible. Lost is the capacity to rebuild the resources that lead to culture. The cruel unite in common purpose but not the good? Surely some state of grace exists between the too sentimental and too cruel. Novelist McCarthy knows this deeply. But filmmaker Hillcoat doesnt seem interested in finding it.

Comments (2) The Road Recommended Watch on Amazon Watch on Netflix Rated R  119 minutes  2009 John Hillcoat who made a name for himself with the leathery Australian western The Proposition (2005) takes on the daunting task of adapting Cormac McCarthys bleak novel about a man and his son trying to survive in a postapocalyptic U.S. Portrayed ad infinitum in sci-fi and fantasy the postapocalypse may now seem about as scary as Post Raisin Bran but Hillcoat gives it an unnerving solidity by focusing on the drab details of survival and linking them to the more hellish aspects of modern American life. (With their ugly accumulations of protective clothing the characters resemble urban homeless and some of the ravaged landscapes they traverse are real locations in Pennsylvania mining country.) Viggo Mortensen plays the father who wants to protect his little boy and preserve his compassion for other people but finds the two objectives frequently in conflict.

The Road Good Director John Hillcoat. Cast Viggo Mortensen Kodi Smit-McPhee Charlize Theron. Rating Rated R for violence disturbing images and language. RELATED Thats intense Viggo talks about The Road McCarthys harsh tales a Hollywood hit 10 movies about the end of the world Movies about the apocalypse Director John Hillcoats film is true to the spirit of Cormac McCarthys Pulitzer Prize-winning novel - if anything too much so. Fans of the book who worried that Hillcoat might sugarcoat it going with a Hollywood ending and thereby softening the novels impact will be relieved. Relief may not be the feeling those unfamiliar with the book will have however. The story set in the decaying aftermath of an unnamed disaster that has wiped out much of the population and all of the rules of law society and even humanity is unquestionably grim. Stick with it though and youll find the promise of hope among a ruined world. If everything you know and love is gone can one ask for anything more? Viggo Mortensen plays the unnamed man at the storys center. Sick and exhausted he is trudging his way through a frozen wasteland. He is trying to survive but his main purpose is to protect his son (Kodi Smit-McPhee) his ""world entire."" There is much from which to protect him. Society in any meaningful form is shattered. Anyone else they run across is likely to be a robber if not a cannibal. Its every man for himself in the extreme. Whatever happened to the world has left it dark cold ugly and dangerous. This complicates moral choices. Is anything off-limits when it comes to survival? The man as far as we can tell is a decent sort. Yet in the world we know some of the choices he makes the actions he takes would be unthinkable if someone described them. But this is not the world we know. Its the world they know fractured corrupted ruined. That changes things. We learn of the mans former life through flashbacks. He and his wife (Charlize Theron) were happy. But then the disaster whatever it was took place leaving the world without power without communication. A bad situation gradually gets worse as society dissolves. The man is convinced that it will be warmer at the coast that other survivors will be headed there too. His wife thinks survival is impossible something that will affect her own decisions greatly. If ""The Road"" were a relentless journey of despair it would be too much. But Hillcoat offers relief in the occasional small victory - an unopened can of Coke for instance a treat the boy has never tasted. Or a stash of fresh supplies. And slowly the boys innate sense of decency even begins to thaw out his father a little. Not too much though. That could prove fatal. Nothing must prevent the boys survival. Mortensen is typically intense; if anything more so than usual. Smit-McPhee is quite good looking for some sense of a childs happiness in what seems a hopeless existence. But ""The Road"" is not just a story of survival or of mans place in a universe gone so incredibly wrong. Above all it is a tale of a fathers unconditional love for his son and how that love makes life worth living ferociously. Whatever it takes. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

"The Road - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-FilmMOVIE REVIEW The RoadAn honorable yet unfulfilling attempt at filming Cormac McCarthys unfilmable book.November 25 2009|By KENNETH TURAN | Film Critic AFTER THE APOCALYPSE Father (Viggo Mortensen) and son (Kodi Smit-McPhee)... (Macall Polay / The Weinstein...)""The Road"" is a road youll wish hadnt been taken. Not because anythings been badly done but because theres a serious imbalance in the complicated equation between what the film forces us to endure and what we end up receiving in return. Given that its based on Cormac McCarthys somber novel winner of the Pulitzer Prize for a devastating report from the end of the world witnessed by a man whos been there its no surprise that the film is for the most part profoundly depressing. What is disappointing is that despite numerous strong areas including fine acting by Viggo Mortensen and young Kodi Smit-McPhee as father-and-son survivors of an unnamed apocalypse what weve been given is no more than a reasonable facsimile an honorable attempt at filming an unfilmable book. As adapted by British playwright Joe Penhall and directed by John Hillcoat best known for the slickly violent ""The Proposition"" ""The Road"" turns out to be good at shocking and upsetting us but it lacks the compensating emotional heft that would make absorbing those shocks worth our while. For while Chris Kennedys formidable production design places us in an uncomfortably real space absent McCarthys haunting language ""The Road"" for the most part is not so good at transcendence at making us feel as the book definitely does that there is reason for us to endure its pitiless descriptions of what Joseph Conrad described in ""Heart of Darkness"" as ""the horror the horror."" What Conrad was likely talking about and what ""The Road"" devotes considerable time to on the screen and on the page is the terrors that humans inflict on each other. One of the provocative questions this story asks is whether staying alive is worth the savagely inhuman actions necessary to make survival possible. Unwilling to begin on a totally downbeat note ""The Road"" opens with what turns out to be a dream flashback to a time just before the unspecified catastrophe happens a time when Mortensens unnamed man is married to Charlize Therons unnamed woman and their first child is on the way. Ten years into the post-apocalypse the mother is gone the unborn child is a young boy (Australian actor Smit-McPhee) and the world has changed. Its a blasted blighted ashen and slowly dying Earth shaken by quakes lighted by out-of-control fires and filled with dead cars empty buildings deserted bridges and very few people. To stay alive in this world you have to keep moving wearing the most utilitarian rags you can find (Margot Wilson did the excellent costume design) and pushing the shopping cart that contains all your possessions. Its a vision of a world largely without us that completely chills the soul. The casting of Mortensen and Smit-McPhee is one of the films strengths. With straggly hair and a great wild look Mortensen is convincing as a harried survivor and the rapport he has with the more innocent and soulful child played by Smit-McPhee is excellent. ""Ive never had a better acting partner"" Mortensen has said ""someone I knew had my back and he knew I had his."" One of the great fears of those few survivors is cannibalism something the strong inflict on the weak and scenes that hint at that are among ""The Roads"" hardest to take. The mans greatest fear is that he will die before his son is old enough to protect himself and the sons greatest fear paradoxically is that he and his father will somehow lose the essence of their humanity in the drive to stay alive. ""Are we still the good guys?"" he asks his father plaintively. ""Are we carrying the fire?"" This pair have their affecting moments as does Robert Duvall as a kind of barely alive human lump but absent McCarthys transformative prose which has a power even images cant improve on what we are left with is more endurance test than anything more elevated. If it is to do more than horrify and depress us ""The Road"" is in need of a finer sensibility and that is simply not on offer. kenneth.turanlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESThis Is the End Los Angeles takes on the apocalypse...June 12 2013Apocalypse and Bill Callahan at CinefamilyAugust 2 2012Theres no end of apocalypse moviesOctober 9 2011An apocalypse you can bearAugust 17 2008MORE STORIES ABOUTFilmApocalypseEntertainmentUnborn ChildCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-road25-2009nov25,0,6229500.story",200,theroad17,theroad,latimes

The unchanging sky resembles hammered lead. The trees are leafless lifeless crashing to earth like poleaxed cattle. Animals have vanished. Cities are rubble fields. Houses are empty. Humanity has been reduced to survivalist stragglers some of whom are amoral cold-blooded killers. The majority died in the unnamed apocalypse or by suicide. Desolate freeways stretch nowhere. The end is near. John Milton described hell as ""darkness visible."" That is the grim mesmerizing world that director John Hillcoat creates here. Based on Cormac McCarthys 2006 novel this is a frontier story where Zane Grey meets Samuel Beckett. The living envy the dead yet they carry on because they must. ""Cannibalism is the great fear"" says our narrator The Man. Which fear? To fall prey to some Donner Party or to turn cannibal oneself? Viggo Mortensen is gripping inhabiting his role with tamped-down intensity. He conveys a gnawing sense of emptiness and futility side by side with indomitable courage. Moving across the corpse of America he must keep alive ""the fire"" of faith and humanity. He must protect his son (Kodi Smit-McPhee) who is about 8 and has never known another world. He passes along a slender moral code Good guys dont eat people. Just in case he carries a gun and two bullets. If not for the boy you feel he would have already used one of them. The film is spare and pure and serious. It is pitiless and close to greatness. Every image -- brooding hills musty Victorian furnishings in a derelict mansion the dark hellmouth of a highway tunnel -- carries weight. The editing is jagged flinch-inducing. Against those constant threats are primal gestures of paternal love. There are flashes of colorful days when the man had a wife (Charlize Theron) who played the piano held his hand bore him a son. Memory is a refuge in this harsh world. Hope is an extravagance. THE ROAD  out of 4 stars Rating R for some violence disturbing images and language.  Where Edina. As they walk to the seacoast -- things might be better there -- the travelers encounter armed gangs and opportunistic thieves. They also meet an elderly man (Robert Duvall) who uses his age as protective camouflage. The Boy wants to keep him. From his fathers example and from somewhere in his soul he has learned compassion. He reminds The Man of an earlier higher level of human development. The film is largely a duet between Mortensen and Smit-McPhee. They are riveting. Mortensen is as gaunt as a concentration camp prisoner beneath his shabby clothing. McPhee is not so starved; the father always feeds the son first. As you watch the interplay between these two you understand why The Man keeps pushing forward. He has not lost the world. Its right beside him stumbling forward holding his hand.

ABOUT THE MOVIEThe Road   1/2 (out of four) StarsViggo Mortensen Charlize Theron Robert Duvall Kodi Smit-McPheeDirector John Hillcoat Distributor Dimension FilmsRating R for some violence disturbing images and language Running time 1 hour 59 minutes Opens Wednesday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY If civilization were obliterated what shreds of humanity would remain in those who survived? The Road probes the meaning of human connection. Cormac McCarthys Pulitzer Prize-winning lyrical novel presents an intimate portrait of a father and son struggling to survive in a post-apocalyptic world. INTERVIEW On The Road and off Viggo Mortensen walks the walk The film adaptation is grimly faithful to the book even as it adds heft to lesser characters. At the heart of this bleak story are two astounding performances. Viggo Mortensen is superb as the father blending a weathered demeanor with indefatigable determination and tenderness. His son is played by 11-year-old Kodi Smit-McPhee whose sweet voice and innocence are ideally suited to the role. The father and son (unnamed as in the book) are refugees pushing a rickety cart with their belongings forced to scrounge for food and water taking shelter wherever they can in the devastated landscape. Amid the ruins of buildings and abandoned cars fires flare and dead trees topple. The world is as ragged as their spirits though we never learn what caused this tragedy. They make their exhausted way among the flattened barren landscape and charred remains dodging cannibals and thieves in their quest to reach a warmer climate by the sea. The father reads to his son especially about courageous heroes. He assures him that they are the good guys and must be ever wary of the bad. When the father shoots a man who threatens them his son is badly shaken. ""Ill kill anyone who touches you because thats my job"" he explains simply. The dead mans blood and bits of his brain are splattered on the boy. His father gently washes his sons hair as the boy whimpers like a baby animal. The haunting scene pierces the heart. The film is beautifully shot with an evocative score that offsets the stark terrain. The role of the boys mother played by Charlize Theron is amplified from her bare-bones presence in the book. While the film is not as resonant as the novel it is an honorable adaptation capturing the essence of the bond between father and son. Their efforts to hold on to their better natures amid soul-killing conditions is stirring and life-affirming.

Thats all we know about the apocalypse and all we need to know.The movie takes place in an America that has been turned into an ash heap with skeletal human survivors picking their way across the cinders. Kept rigorously in the foreground are a Man (Viggo Mortensen) and a Boy (Kodi Smit-McPhee) the latter born shortly after the end came and thus a creature exclusively of this fallen world.The two are traveling from the interior to the coast before winter comes - thats the action of the movie. That and keeping clear of marauding bands of men who would gladly skin them and eat them. Also as the boy reminds his father the two ""carry the fire whatever that means. It could refer to decency and goodness the guttering spark of humanity. It could just mean theyre still alive.""The Road has been poured straight from McCarthys bleak bottle and brought to the screen by Australian John Hillcoat who turned the 2005 Outback Western ""The Proposition into an epic of blasted landscapes and bloody motivations. Hes the man for the job yet in adapting this harsh unyielding book for the screen Hillcoat and screenwriter Joe Penhall pull their punches the slightest degree and thus too much.Or maybe movies can only dully visualize horrors the best writers hint at. Hillcoats ""Road is true to the books profoundly moving post-nuclear stoicism but it cant quite get those biblical cadences that make McCarthy such a transfixing read. The Coens managed it with ""No Country for Old Men so it can be done but you have to be willing to go all the way into the dark. As a colleague said after seeing this movie you need to show the baby on the spit. ""The Road doesnt dare cant dare and is the lesser thing.Whats on the screen is disturbing enough. (Even at that it has taken a year for the Weinsteins the producers and distributors of ""The Road to get the nerve to release the film.) As the Man and the Boy drag their shopping cart across whats left of America the enormity of the cataclysm is glimpsed forward and backward. A wife (Charlize Theron) who may have been the braver for opting out. An impossibly old man (Robert Duvall) like a figure out of ""Godot unable to go on but still going on. A trap door in a kitchen that leads to something youd better not think about.There are other basements and further revelations in ""The Road but Hillcoat avoids jack-in-the-box suspense cliches; the movie plods with a literalism thats at times too reverent (as is Nick Caves score piling on a sensitive ""mournfulness both redundant and unnecessary). Mortensen underplays his role admirably and Smit-McPhee is gratifyingly unactorly. At the movies best we see their relationship shift as something crucial and inarticulate is passed from one generation to the next.Like all end-of-the-world fiction ""The Road brings iconic meaning to the smallest of gestures. A single kindness becomes the hope of humanity; a cruel act the path to hell. If I have mixed feelings about the movie its because Hillcoat honors the storys minimalism without bringing his own sensibilities to bear on the material. Hes spooked by the responsibility and maybe hes right When the director does add a single furry detail to the final scenes it feels like a surrender to sentiment.At the same time everything about the film is a welcome rebuke to the happy-face apocalypse of ""2012 a movie that turns mass extinction into the Greatest Show on Earth. In ""The Road what has been lost is recognized as infinitely precious; whats left is bitter and our due.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. For more on movies go to www.boston.com/movienation.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet A sobering chaser to the apocalyptic swill of 2012 the film adaptation of Cormac McCarthys The Road has the good taste to not turn mass destruction into bread-and-circuses spectacle and the integrity to recognize that when the world comes to an end the world actually comes to an end. Whatever hopefulness can be drawn from McCarthys unrelentingly bleak vision comes from our will to survive when all is lost and humanity is shuffling toward extinction. In that sense The Road is something like a zombie movie as father and son traverse a landscape filled with emaciated marauders whose compassion and decency have been supplanted by raw need. Needless to say their journey is dangerous but its haunted further by the reality that salvation likely isnt waiting at the end of the line. Turning McCarthys novel into a palatable feature film couldnt have been easy but director John Hillcoat (The Proposition) and cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe supply some arresting images of an earth thats literally dying shrouded in ash and littered with the artifacts of an unthinkable (and unspecified) human tragedy. Viggo Mortensen and newcomer Kodi Smit-McPhee also acquit themselves nicely as a strong-willed father and son who trudge across this barren country in search of food and shelter while dodging bands of cannibals. The constant threat of death whether through slow starvation or an attack from savages should sustain a low-level tension throughout but The Road is mysteriously flat meandering from episode to episode without giving them much individual life. Hillcoat gives the film a remarkably evocative backdrop but the drama lacks depth and dimension and the scenes tend to blur together. And as grim as The Road gets Hillcoat goes a little soft at the wrong time. Someone like Michael Haneke would have no trouble embracing this materials uncompromising dreariness--in fact Haneke already did his own post-apocalyptic film in Time Of The Wolf--but Hillcoat allows the hard-won emotion of the final scene to veer decisively into sentimentality. (Points off for Nick Cave and Warren Ellis disappointingly mawkish score which tips the balance more than it should.) The Road honors McCarthys book with haunting pictures of the futures end--the persistent thud of dead trees crashing to the ground is particularly chilling--but they tend to overwhelm the drama in the fore.

The few very few people left alive in the wake of a mysterious cataclysm (nuclear? climatic? environmental?) have turned predatory. There is little food to eat and so humans are eating humans. They are raping pillaging killing. The suicide lesson is a last resort - a preemptive option before doom closes in.The Man and the Boy - Viggo Mortensen in a beautifully calibrated performance and Kodi Smit-McPhee unself-consciously mastering a range of intense emotions - are ""heading south for the Coast."" That sounds like a pleasant enough excursion until you look at the terrain they must cross denuded forests abandoned ash-coated highways old houses strewn with corpses - a landscape of rot and emptiness godless gray.A marvel of production design - the wasted Interstates the graffitied billboards the body parts wedged under burnt cars - The Road offers a bleak but soulful allegory about survival about the bonds between parent and child. Scripted by the British playwright Joe Penhall using McCarthys precise staccato prose as a model The Road is well a road movie a journey from Point A to Point B with the good the bad and the ugly encountered along the way. There are challenges to face decisions to be made.Shot mostly in rugged pockets of western Pennsylvania and on the shores of Lake Eriethe film somber and spooky is in constant danger of slipping into self-parody Zombieland after all uses a similar postapocalyptic template - a small band of survivors on the run from flesh-eating subhumans - and its way more fun. But Hillcoat director of the scruffily biblical Australian western The Proposition keeps the focus on Mortensen and Smit-McPhee dragging their shopping cart of belongings across the desolation huddling together in the cold the father trying to teach his son about good and evil right and wrong. (Its impossible to watch The Road and not think about the plight of the homeless in our cities and country today - for many a personal apocalypse is already here.)The two actors - the pro and the novice - share the screen almost all of the time and theyre riveting. The flashbacks to the way things were - when the Boys mother (Charlize Theron) was still alive - provide a context of mourning and memory. Robert Duvall shows up in a small but pivotal role. And Javier Aguirresarobe cinematographer for Woody Allens light-infused Vicky Cristina Barcelona finds the poetry in the awfulness His dark affecting shots are full of tragic beauty.The Road isnt a masterpiece. The stark simplicity of the story the drudgery of survival - not to mention its grisly George Romero moments - sometimes thwart the deeper themes that the filmmakers aspired to mine. But I cannot think of another film this year that has stayed with me its images of dread and fear - and yes perhaps hope - kicking around like such a terrible dream.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

In this adaptation of Cormac McCarthys revered 2006 novel Viggo Morten-sen caked in grime plays the father with a fierce physicality and tremulous woundedness. The film has one other thing going for it Visually its one of the most spookily convincing least ""movieish"" visions of a bombed-out wasteland future Ive ever seen. (Its never stated that there was a nuclear war a meteor or whatever but theres an ashy deadness to everything on screen.) The wreckage and twisted clutter some of it spectacular doesnt seem as if it was planted there by a set designer; its an organic part of the landscape. This debris has integrity almost the way the ruined city in Full Metal Jacket did. Yet The Road for all its vivid desolation remains a curiously unmoving experience -- or maybe not so curious given that nothing really happens in it. In the novel McCarthy played off postapocalyptic Hollywood thrillers and so he gave you the heady feeling that you were seeing a movie unfold on the page. Yet he brought off that feat without much action; the backdrop was grand the emotions interior and refined. Thats a problem when The Road is done as a movie Its like a zombie thriller drowning in tastefully severe art-house gloom. The darkest note in the story -- its what no conventional sci-fi blockbuster would dare to include -- is the Mortensen characters despairing realization that he must be prepared at any moment to fire a bullet into his beloved son should they be captured since the bandits who roam the land would rape and kill the boy if he didnt. Thats a haunting thing to live with and saucer-eyed Kodi Smit-McPhee plays the son with touching half-aware innocence. But thats not enough to save the movie from its creeping inertness. The Road was originally set to come out last year and in one sense the decision to delay its release was karmically right since (like 2012) it addresses the current mood of nerve-jangling anxiety and doom. Yet the timing also works against the film. Theres enough foreboding in America right now to make sitting through a movie such as The Road seem like one more heavy burden that frankly no one needs.

A blasted ashen landscape. Half-mad survivalists roaming the empty roads looking for food women gasoline. And a single stalwart man doing what he can to keep himself and humanity alive. Where have we seen this before? The Road (R) Dimension (119 min.)Directed by John Hilcoat. With Viggo Mortensen Kodi Smit-McPhee Charlize Theron. Now playing in New Jersey. Stephen Whittys review TWO STARS Rating note The film contains graphic violence. Well just about everywhere since the first wave of here-comes-the-apocalypse thrillers began in the `50s. Sometimes they were serious (""Five"" ""On the Beach""). Sometimes they were exploitive (""In the Year 2889"" ""Panic in Year Zero""). Sometimes they were even both (""Mad Max""). But they werent boring - until ""The Road."" With a literary pedigree (its adapted from the novel by Cormac McCarthy) and a smart director (John Hilcoat a big-buzz Aussie auteur after the grimy Western ""The Proposition"") it comes replete with a couple of stars and an awful lot of Significance with a capital ""S"". How significant? Viggo Mortensen plays ""The Man"" (in the anonymous Everyman sense not in the ""Stick it to the ..."" blaxploitation sense). Charlize Theron is ""Wife."" Kodi Smit-McPhee is ""The Boy."" And Im The Audience and Im annoyed. Not that the film doesnt look wonderful. Veteran Spanish cinematographer Javier Aquirresarobe -- whose credits range from ""Goyas Ghosts"" to the recent ""New Moon"" -- does wonders with a limited palette of grays. And the performances -- particularly the young Smit-McPhee as Mortensens scared and bewildered son -- are strong. But whatever literary value the McCarthy novel had has been leached away. And whats left -- the paramilitary-style vigilantes the desperate cannibals the constant frantic search for some safe place -- are things weve seen before in films that had far fewer pretensions and far more interest in actually delivering some thrills. ""The Road"" however just plods along mile after mile stopping occasionally for a flashback (Theron showing up to give a hint of what led us here) or a guest star (Robert Duvall popping up along the way as a character known only of course as ""Old Man."") Any movie fan with even a glancing interest in sci-fi has seen at least half-a-dozen movies like this -- and thats the problem. Because the filmmaker and actors dont seem to have seen any and they think theyre breaking new ground when all theyre doing is pilfering picked-over graves. No one takes all of this more seriously than Mortensen who has the face of a saint in a woodcut and the scary intensity of a martyr. But for what cause? Its a tense anguished performance but the piece itself is all of a piece -- leaden skies leaden faces leaden hopes. Mortensens commitment is commendable but all hes committed to is gussied-up watered-down genre movie -- ""The Postman"" plus Cormac McCarthys reputation minus any kind of entertainment. Just pain and disease violence and despair. But hey -- terrific scheduling idea for the Thanksgiving weekend. Who wouldnt want to see a film about a ruined America and starving families?

Director John Hillcoats film version scripted by playwright Joe Penhall constitutes an act of faithful adaptation. Yet its faithfulness is more to the letter than the spirit and its not the work of an inspired director merely a dogged one. The script and the imagery take the story in some peculiar directions in the name of ""relatability"" and odd as it sounds sentimentality. The best thing about the film is Viggo Mortensens performance. A stealth talent of many shadings Mortensen has a way of fitting easily into nearly any period any milieu. He plays the man with no name a survivor of the global apocalypse making his way south to the coast with his son (Kodi Smit-McPhee affecting and true). This film is the opposite of ""2012"" which is of course stupid (though I enjoyed it) and all about the ""why"" and ""how"" in relation to wiping out millions. ""The Road"" is not stupid This most noble and stripped-down of road movies is a story of a father bequeathing to his son every decent lesson in survival and humanity he can before its too late. The story has its share of ""bad guys"" cannibals and marauders threatening the oft-referred-to ""good guys."" (For all his grace and skill as a prose stylist McCarthy prefers his moral boundaries clean and clear even in a muddy landscape such as this.) As father and son and their shopping cart head down desolate highways scrounging for food they meet up with a blind man (Robert Duvall) among others. They reach the fathers childhood home. The film pushes on from adversity to triumph to lucky break to heartbreak. The good father and his saintly boy who must ""carry the fire"" when he is gone cannot help but tug at the heart even as Hillcoats direction struggles to find a rhythm a dramatic shape for the ashen wash of circumstance. The peculiar thing about ""The Road"" on screen is its determination to comfort us. An ill-advised number of flashbacks featuring Charlize Theron as the long-gone mother of the boy serve as honey-toned relief from the present-day grimness. Hillcoat and his designers working in the real and digital worlds manage to create a convincing series of locales and vegetation-free horizons. Yet the direction is static. The individual images evoke plenty but the scenes often stall even when its another life-and-death encounter with the redneck cannibals who do not carry the fire. In David Mamets 1988 play ""Speed-the-Plow"" two studio executives joke about the insanity of adapting a literary allegory titled ""The Bridge; or Radiation and the Half-Life of Society."" ""The Road"" is the closest well ever get to seeing that (nonexistent) number at the multiplexes. Already Hillcoats film has divided critics on the international festival circuit. The one constant is the praise rightly so for Mortensen. On balance he makes the movie worth a tussle though I prefer my blasted-landscape allegories (Bergmans ""Shame"" being the paragon) without a climax that tries to jerk more tears than ""Shane"" did.

Almost all the people have disappeared from America and he cant find one more bullet or another weapon. Everywhere they go they seem to be walking down the middle of a road. Making no real effort to hide. At night every fire is a bon fire that you would be able to see from miles away. These people are to stupid to live in the world they inhabit. The kid does not seem like he was born into this world. He seems more like he was just in school last week. A kid born into that world would have been taught survival skills from the time he could walk not be walking around with his Bun Bun (the stuffed rabbit). A friend of mine grew tobacco in Holland to sell to the German soldiers so he and his mother could eat. He was 10. More likely at 11 he would be carrying a weapon and have used it before. Posted by Merle Goertz | December 06 2009 at 0100 AM To me this was just too much like I am Legend. Both are let down by their endings and their connections to the original work will always be problematic for fans. But there was just too many similarities between the two. Within the first five minutes of The Road I already knew how the whole movie would play out. Thanks to I Am William Smith. A perfect example is the cellar scene vs. the parking garage scene. Smith had a better co-star/actor in that dog though. Posted by Kotuchboom | November 30 2009 at 1249 PM The comments to this entry are closed.

"Road The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; road-the ) Road The (United States 2009) November 22 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli The Road is undoubtedly one of the falls most anticipated offerings in part because it has been lingering on the horizon of the cinematic landscape for a year. Originally scheduled for a release in late 2008 it was delayed when filmmaker John Hillcoat (The Proposition) determined that his preferred cut could not be made available in time. A tentative March 2009 opening was scratched when The Weinstein Company decided that the film had Oscar potential. So now 12 months after its expected availability Hillcoats interpretation of Cormac McCarthys brutal post-apocalyptic novel is ready for theatrical viewing. To begin with its worth re-stating a point that has been made elsewhere McCarthy is not easy to adapt. His novels have largely been ignored as source material for motion pictures for this reason. The Coens changed that with No Country for Old Men but their success doesnt mean the task is easier - just that its feasible. Some might argue that The Road is among McCarthys most inherently non-cinematic books even going so far as to call it ""unadaptable."" With this consideration in mind one has to be impressed by what Hillcoat and his screenwriter Joe Penhall have accomplished. The movie The Road is nowhere close to its literary sire but its probably the best one could hope for from a movie version. This is not a good date movie (unless you have an understanding and open-minded date) and its not a feel-good opportunity. As those who have read McCarthys novel are aware this is a tough tough story. Its about loss death isolation and the fine line that divides good from evil man from animal. Yes The Road ends on what can best be described as a hopeful note but that doesnt wipe away the nearly two hours of emotional punishment that precede it. Those willing to travel The Road need to know what to expect going in and have to be willing to accept the film for what it is. Its forceful but its not fun. Before the movie opens an unspecified cataclysm has impacted the world. Its specifics are never revealed but they are not germane to the story. The Road follows two survivors Father (Viggo Mortensen) and Son (Kodi Smit-McPhee) as they go about the day-to-day business of existence some number of years after The Fall. The Mother (Charlize Theron) who didnt give birth until after the cataclysm is no longer around. As we see in flashbacks increasing waves of despair led her to wander alone into the cold and dark and die. Father and Son traverse lonely roads with only the vaguest of goals in mind reach the coast then head south where there might be people. There are dangers aplenty including amoral cannibalistic gangs; disease; and most pressing starvation. Water is plentiful but food is not. Actors Viggo Mortensen and Kodi Smit-McPhee have difficult physically demanding tasks. Mortensen with an unkempt beard that makes him look like a mountain man embodies someone who has decided to live instead of give up and whose every ounce of effort is devoted to protecting his son. Smit-McPhee shows maturity and impressive range for one so young. The supporting cast although small and each with roles little more substantive than cameos is high-profile Theron Rubert Duvall and Guy Pearce. The Road is reminiscent of the 80s post-apocalyptic drama Testament which also dealt with the concept of survival in a dying world. The Road is a little more bleak in part because the filming locations convey genuine devastation (some scenes were shot in and around post-Katrina New Orleans) and in part because of the isolation of the main characters. The Father and Son are alone in the world. They must face the reality that there could be instances in which death would be preferable to the continuation of life. (The Father keeps a loaded gun with two bullets - one for himself and one for the boy.) The film depicts how dire circumstances can bring out the best and the worst in human beings - far more often the latter than the former. The Road asks basic questions about what it means to be human and whether the need to survive is a basic drive. Perhaps the central question is a simple one Would you want to continue living if there was no hope of happiness and if everything was a struggle? When asked if he ever thought about giving up and dying the vagabond played by Robert Duvall has a simple answer ""No. In these times we cant afford such luxuries."" The look of the film is evocative with frequent shots of broken cities blasted forests and wide expanses of dead country. The only sun is in brief beautiful flashbacks that end with sudden jolts back to reality. The sky is a constant slate gray and it seems to be raining as often as it is merely cloudy. Color is desaturated; The Road might just as easily have been filmed in black-and-white. There are those who will condemn this picture as being two grueling torturous hours. In some ways its hard to disagree with this - it is difficult and at times unpleasant. But its also powerful and provides unsparing insight into human nature. Theres an unfortunate tendency to turn post-apocalyptic stories into rousing action/adventure epics (one shudders at the consideration of what may be planned by Roland Emmerich for his TV ""sequel"" to 2012). By taking a more realistic approach The Road suggests that dying in a global catastrophe may be a better alternative to surviving beyond it.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review The Feel-Bad Movie of the Year You thought you were depressedand then you saw The Road. _ By David Edelstein Published Nov 16 2009 ShareThis (Photo Macall Polay/Courtesy of 2929/Dimension Films) Doomsday sagas have never been far from our collective American imagination but theyve rarely been closer. The end-of-the-world cult of 2012 (Mayan calendar solar neutrinos bad vibes from the planet Nibiru etc.) will only fatten its membership in the wake of the idiotic movie of the same name. Throw in (likely) environmental catastrophe worldwide economic collapse peak oil Al Qaeda with Pakistani nukes Obama the Antichrist a zombie-cannibal plague and apocalypse is in the air la-la. Now comes the starkest doomsday movie yet The Road from a novel by Cormac McCarthy our priest of high-toned despair. McCarthy will never get over the end of the Age of Good Men (which never existed but dont tell him that). He has staked his career on the idea that were entering a time of humanity in extremis one in which chaos is ascendant and cannibalism literal and metaphorical is the rule not the exception. The road of The Road is paved with literal cannibals. But its also a metaphor for the blind imperative of a father The Man (Viggo Mortensen) to keep his son The Boy (Kodi Smit-McPhee) both eating and uneaten. What brought about the blinding flash that ends civilization? McCarthy isnt telling and neither are director John Hillcoat and screenwriter Joe Penhall. Project on this disaster what you will. (See the list above.) The dying world through which father and son trudge is monochromaticfaded browns grays from sooty to milky an occasional splash of dark blood. Green is history. Bare trees tumble. Fires spring up. Human bones dot the landscape. There was once a mother The Woman (Charlize Theron) whom we see in The Mans dreams but her maternal instincts fell (strangely) by the wayside. Only The Man persists. The child is my warrant he narrates. If he is not the word of God then God never spoke. It might have been Darwin who spokebut lets not go there. On its own grueling terms The Road works. It brings you down down down and its characters famishment is contagious Your heart leaps at the sight of a can of peaches. Mortensen bearded smudged greasy-haired has a primal haggard beauty. He lectures his son on the need for the fire inside and thats what we see in his unblinking eyes as his body wastes away. He clutches a gun with two bullets and teaches The Boy to put the barrel in ones mouth and pull the triggerthe thinking being that a quick death is better than slow starvation or being eaten. But thats a last resort. Mostly he uses that gun to threaten and/or blow away anything that imperils his son. Whats odd is that although The Boy never knew the brotherhood-of-man era he pleadsin a voice that hasnt brokento share their food and trembles with grief when his single-minded father remains unswayed by his humanism. Yet the father doesnt mock his son Part of him must want to keep The Boy a boy. Are we the good guys? his son asks again and again as if chanting in prayer. Yes says The Man. The movie has a dogged integrity. An inept thief (Michael Kenneth Williams the magnetic Omar from The Wire) seems too pathetic for The Man to punish but is cruelly punished anyway. When Robert Duvall totters on as The Old Man (a guest-star survivor akin to the guest-star hillbillies in Cold Mountain) we think they might adopt him as a surrogate Gramps. But The Man sees him only as a drain on their food and The Old Man gets the drift without being told. What a tough smart actor Duvall is. The Old Man seems enfeebled perhaps senileuntil Duvall gives you glimmers of his caginess. Affecting frailty is a survival mechanism too. Evocative as it is The Road comes up short not because its bleak but because its monotonous and because McCarthys vision is finally as inflexible as his patriarchal heros. (Having Mom lurch off is quite an evolutionary statement.) That said the author-hero of 2012 (John Cusack) who wrote a book in which humans cling to their goodness on the brink of extinction seems boobishly naive. The truth is likely somewhere in the middle. But unlike these overeager doomsday fanatics I hope never to find out. The premise of Oren Movermans The Messenger is enough to scare people off. Will Montgomery (Ben Foster) returns from Iraq a hero and accepts a job on a casualty notification team delivering news of a childs or spouses death. What makes the film very fine is its complicated perspective. We stand with the messengers observing the objects of their missions with empathy and (enforced) detachment. These people take the news in vastly different wayswith tears always but sometimes with fury and violence. Their grief is all their own. Montgomerys seasoned partner (Woody Harrelson) counsels him to keep his distance but Will cant pull deep enough into himself. He fixates on a widow (Samantha Morton) with a small child and in scenes both creepy and moving (it seesaws) he begins a courtship. 1 2 Next Share this story...

The lower-case ""tiff"" the color of a pumpkin blares from posters and billboards throughout the city as a symbol of festival director Piers Handlings determination to simplify everything including the logo in a movie orgy that has clearly outgrown itself. Last year the sheer bloat of this annual circus inspired accusations of ""elitism"" and complaints that a beloved event started by three movie buffs in 1975 was ""no longer the peoples film festival."" This year in the midst of a hobbling global recession the goal is to ""return the festival to the people"" as 312 feature films flow through every projector in the city from 9 a.m. screenings for priority press to midnight-madness horror flicks featuring the latest assortment of infectious viruses rampaging zombies and flesh-eating ghouls for the unwashed masses toting sandwich bags and styrofoam cups from Starbucks. (The projectionists sleep from 2 a.m. to dawn.) I dont know about a return to simpler days but there is certainly something here for every taste. You can see documentaries about Hugh Hefner and Glenn Gould; endless tracts on the war in Iraq; Michael Moores latest assault on capitalism (blame it all on Bushs bank bailouts); Drew Barrymores making her directorial debut with Whip It starring Ellen Page on roller skates; a vampire musical called Suck; Jewish liturgy from the Coen brothers; and another loathsome barf job by Danish wacko Lars von Trier called Antichrist in which pickle-faced Charlotte Gainsbourg who always looks embalmed prunes away her genitalia with garden shears. Naturally it will show up shortly in the New York Film Festival the official depository for movies nobody wants to see where torturing the audience has become an acknowledged priority. Despite the volume of product there is evidence wherever you turn that the fat has been trimmed. Recession-cautious buyers are stoic and roughly 100 of the films on display have arrived without any distributors at all. Unlike Cannes which has an actual film market resembling a tag sale Torontos deals are more informal with the buying and selling done on cell phones and in hotel lobbies. Hollywood studios are scaling back on the swag. There are fewer exclusive dinners midnight cocktail soirees corporate sponsors red-carpet premieres limousine rentals and hairdresser appointments. Nobody seems to care much about shelling out money even for bragging rights. But George Christys coveted annual lunch at the Four Seasons went on as planned; Matt Damon hosted another charity benefit for underprivileged kids; and Joan Baez gave a free concert in the middle of the street. This year the lavish party circuit is taking a back seat to the movies and glam venues like the Rosewater Supper Club and Ultra have a lot of blank pages in their reservation books. Never mind. Swag or no swag the boldface names are here anyway. Spotted in full gridlock on the red-carpet runway Demi Moore Ann-Margret Norman Jewison Mariah Carey Ewan McGregor Jeff Bridges Keanu Reeves Viggo Mortensen one-name-is-all-you-need Oprah assorted Colins (Farrell and Firth) Jennifers (Connelly and Garner but not Aniston) and Michaels (Caine Douglas Moore and J. Fox). Not to mention Bill Murray Patricia Clarkson Christopher Plummer Penelope Cruz Clive Owen Edward Norton Chris Rock Nicolas Cage Robin Wright Penn and others too famous to mention. They only stay long enough to suffer through the idiotic press conferences pose and then head for the airport. Some of them dont even have movies to plug. Theyre just here for the photo ops. George Clooney is everywhere with his hand in a bandage--a good excuse for not signing autographs. Jane Fonda is not here but sent some controversy in her place. When she heard about this years sidebar event honoring Israeli films and the city of Tel Aviv she signed a protest letter attacking the Israelis and defending Palestine which elicited an enraged response from Jon Voight her co-star in Coming Home who accused a deluded Jane of once again backing all the wrong people. Result A series that stood every chance of being ignored suddenly had a new focus of world interest. Too bad Jane and cohorts like Harry Belafonte and Wallace Shawn didnt know one of the films they boycotted was a collaboration between Israeli and Pakistani co-directors. I skipped Triage an Irish war drama with Colin Farrell as a wounded front-lines freelance photographer in Kurdistan (he lost 25 pounds for the role by living on black coffee cigarettes and two cans of tuna per day) and opted for a live auction where one of the prizes was tea with Diane Lane to ""talk Hollywood world issues and life."" Dont ask. WOLFING DOWN CLUB sandwiches and Yoo-hoos you finally try to see some movies. After years of bad advice from festival brochures and eager press agents experience (and failing eyesight) have taught me to cross off some contenders early just from the synopses like the one that ""tells the story of 13-year-old Gunther growing up in the 1980s in a household of drunks gamblers and womanizers in small-town Belgium."" Or how about ""an alcoholic actress trying to put her life together"" and ""a young mother struggling to shake a drug habit""? Sometimes the titles alone will do it (Bitch Slap Women Without Men The Men Who Stare at Goats). In all the clutter I have still managed to see some amazing films. If Toronto sets the tone for the forthcoming awards season you can plan ahead for a few riveting performances and welcome surprises. You also better plan to dress up for depression. Viggo Mortensen gives the performance of his career in the faithfully rendered film adaptation of Cormac McCarthys heartbreaking apocalyptic novel The Road. After an unspecified global catastrophe wipes out most of the world including his wife (Charlize Theron) a desperate father (a gaunt Viggo) in an attempt to stay alive takes his son on a long and dangerous journey to the sea across a burned-out America encountering cannibalism rape and other bleak nightmares amid the last remnants of human life (Robert Duvall and Guy Pearce among them). Artistically rendered by director John Hillcoat sensitively adapted by Joe Penhall hauntingly shot in many of the post-Katrina landscapes in southern Louisiana and wonderfully acted (especially by Viggo whose face has been described as an El Greco etching) The Road is a tremendous achievement. George Clooney is unveiling two alleged ""comedies"" simultaneously--one good the other an insufferable disaster. In Jason (Juno) Reitmans smart cynical and witty Up in the Air the suave Hollywood film personality his fans have erroneously labeled ""the new Cary Grant"" plays a cool emotionally detached and swellegantly groomed businessman whose job is to fly around America downsizing companies and firing people. Hes a termination specialist whose only goal in life is to rack up 10 million frequent flyer miles. But fate intervenes when he meets a tough cookie played by the fantastic Vera Farmiga and all bets are off when he breaks his own rules falls in love against his better judgment and finds his heart. The payoff (a basically venal character who deceptively appears to have everything already reevaluates his career priorities when he learns how much hes been missing) is not as sappy as it sounds and the ending is a kick in the shins. Up in the Air often looks like an American Airlines commercial and I wouldnt call it a feel-good movie per se but theres a certain satisfaction watching two snappy beautiful people at the top of their form. Mr. Clooney has never looked better acted with more confidence or oozed more charm but hes no Cary Grant.

This ""Road"" leads nowhere. If youre going to adapt a book like Cormac McCarthys 2006 bestseller youre pretty much obliged to make a terrific film or its not worth doing -- first because expectations are high and second because the picture needs to make it worth peoples while to sit through something so grim. Except for the physical aspects of this bleak odyssey by a father and son through a post-apocalyptic landscape this long-delayed production falls dispiritingly short on every front. Showing clear signs of being test-screened and futzed with to death the Dimension release may receive a measure of respect in some quarters but is very very far from the film it should have been spelling moderate to tepid B.O. prospects after big fest preems. Even more than ""No Country for Old Men"" with which the Coen brothers showed what is possible artistically and commercially with a McCarthy novel onscreen ""The Road"" reads extremely cinematically. Filled almost entirely by spare but vivid physical descriptions of a decimated United States in its death throes after an unexplained catastrophe and with limited dialogue the book serves up images and tense situations that practically leap from the page as potential movie scenes. Some things were obvious The films style needed to be as terse exacting stripped-down tough and precise as McCarthys prose style. The picture also should have been shocking haunting and at the end deeply moving. As it is director John Hillcoat (""The Proposition"") and lenser Javier Aguirresarobe have come up with some arresting scorched-earth vistas captured on locations in Louisiana Pennsylvania and Oregon but have missed the bigger picture almost entirely. Its a survival story in the most elemental possible way as an unnamed man and boy about 11 trudge daily through a dark world of barren forests with falling trees torched towns and vandalized stores empty roads and depleted fields in search of food and shelter all the while taking care to avoid roving gangs searching for defenseless humans to be turned into slaves or more likely dinner. The man (Viggo Mortensen) has a revolver with two bullets in it then only one. As far too many flashbacks of his pre-catastrophe life reveal hes not a military or survivalist type and he had a gorgeous wife (Charlize Theron) until she couldnt stand it anymore and took off. But his love for his son (Kodi Smit-McPhee) has made him resourceful and resolute despite the utter lack of long-term prospects and he continually responds to the youngsters despairing questions with answers that insist upon perseverance. For reasons that remain unclear even after they arrive there they are walking toward the sea and dreadful sights abound along the way skeletons rotting bodies naked prisoners locked in dark basements like animals to be butchered (the books two most ghastly images have been dispensed with however). Occasionally they chance upon an abandoned house with a stock of canned food (Coca-Cola has no problem surviving the apocalypse) clean blankets and clothes. The drama is one little genre step away from being an outright zombie movie something thats much more evident onscreen with its drooling crusty-toothed aggressors and live humans with missing limbs; memories of ""Night of the Living Dead"" unavoidably advance in all the scenes in which the man and boy take refuge in a house where they must contend with unfriendly marauders. But Hillcoat who played with heavy violence in ""The Proposition"" and made some of it stick shows no talent for or inclination toward setting up a scene here; any number of sequences in ""The Road"" could have been very suspenseful if built up properly but Hillcoat working from a script by Joe Penhall just hopscotches from scene to scene in almost random fashion without any sense of pacing or dramatic modulation. Dialogue that should have been directed with an almost Pinteresque sense of timing is delivered without meaningful shadings principally by two actors who have no chemistry together. Unfortunately Mortensen lacks the gravitas to carry the picture; suddenly resembling Gabby Hayes with his whiskers and wayward hair the actor has no bottom to him and his interactions with Smit-McPhee whom one can believe as Therons son but not Mortensens never come alive. Tellingly both thesps are better in their individual scenes with other actors; Mortensen gets into it with Robert Duvall who plays an old coot met along the road while Smit-McPhee registers a degree of rapport with Guy Pearce practically unrecognizable at first as another wanderer. Generally the boys readings are blandly on the nose. Scraps of narration by Mortensen seem like unnecessary afterthoughts while the preponderance of scenes featuring the wife is explainable only because Therons presence needed to be justified by more screen time. Score by longtime Hillcoat collaborator Nick Cave and Warren Ellis borders on the treacly softening the tone and further conventionalizing a film that should have gone the other direction toward something harsh and daring.
