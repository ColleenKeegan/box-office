A black ops super agent seeks payback after she is betrayed and set up during a mission. Video courtesy Relativity Media. By Joe Morgenstern January 20 2012 In a movie thats basically about watching a formidable female run kick and punch her way through a world of treacherous males one of the best exchanges comes when her betrayer orders a dapper assassin to terminate her. ""Ive never done a woman before"" the designated killer says to which the other guy replies ""You shouldnt think of her as being a woman."" Good advice given her awesome prowess but how should we think of Mallory Kane the special-ops agent played by Gina Carano a mixed martial-arts virtuoso making her feature debut? As a fighting machine one that registers ambient danger with all the efficiency of The Terminator and the light irony of James Bond but also as a beautifully seductive construction at the center of a film that is itself an elegant machine. Theres no deeper meaning to Steven Soderberghs thriller than what meets the eye yet its lustrous surfaces offer great and guilt-free pleasure. ENLARGE Gina Carano and Ewan McGregor in Haywire. Relativity Media The story starts in upstate New York then moves to Barcelona Dublin New Mexico and Washington. The plot--basically betrayal followed by payback--pits Mallory against the unprincipled security contractor shes been working for plus all of his shadowy minions. The action isnt nonstop no matter what the trailer makes you think. Some of the most satisfying stretches come when something is about to happen as in a very long and ominous tracking shot that follows Mallory down a Dublin sidewalk across the street from St. Stephens Green. (Mr. Soderbergh directing from a script by Lem Dobbs did his own cinematography which is richly understated when the colors arent morphing into interludes of grainy black-and-white or baleful ocher.) When something does happen its usually a violent confrontation between Mallory and her baselessly confident adversaries. In at least two instances she visits unusual pain and suffering on their genitals but thats far from the only page in her playbook of righteous mayhem. Most of her moves are the ones Ms. Carano deploys in the relatively new arena of womens mixed martial arts except that here in the arena of mainstream action thrillers the newly minted movie star must do more than dabble in the dramatic arts. So how does she do? Really well all things considered meaning that most movie performances are constructed from discrete pieces and this one is no exception; that her sultry voice may be a discreetly enhanced version of the one she uses in real life and that her character by the nature of the special-ops trade finds her finest expression in exuberant physicality. It remains to be seen whether Ms. Caranos star presence will take her beyond action roles but shes certainly appealing in this one and very much at home in a strong cast that includes Michael Fassbender Ewan McGregor Michael Douglas Antonio Banderas Channing Tatum Bill Paxton and Michael Angarano. Keep an eye out too for a deer but not in anyones headlights. Miss Bala Watch a clip of ""Miss Bala"" a story of a young woman clinging on to her dream to become a beauty contest queen in a Mexico dominated by organized crime. Video courtesy of Fox. No beauty contest has ever been more bizarre than the one in Gerardo Naranjos shockingly powerful thriller in Spanish with English subtitles. The tearful winner Laura (Stephanie Sigman) a 23-year-old innocent from Tijuana is crowned Miss Baja even though sheer terror has kept her from saying a single word to the audience or smiling a genuine smile. The source of her paralysis isnt stage fright but fear for her life. Through no fault of her own Laura has fallen into the clutches of a Baja California narco gang that engineered her hollow triumph. (The ironic title means ""Miss Bullet."") Mr. Naranjo a gifted filmmaker who wrote the film with Mauricio Katz never insists on symbols--theres too much action and suspense for that--but its irresistible to see his heroine as a stand-in for her beautiful country increasingly a hostage to savage crime. ENLARGE Stephanie Sigman in Miss Bala. 2oth Century Fox This is a remarkable film with a strong performance in the title role. Ms. Sigman whose beauty would shine in any contest is only a couple of years older than the character she plays and her professional experience is limited; she came to acting by way of modeling. Still she energizes every scene shes in i.e. every scene in the movie which never for a moment loses track of her or fails to show the action from Lauras point of view. And the action as designed by Mr. Naranjo and his cinematographer Matyas Erdely has a disjunct quality that borders on the surreal. Street battles break out without warning setting thugs armed to the teeth against cops coming on like special-forces commandos. During lulls in the action the Estrella gangs trucks and SUVs course through city streets in motorcades that avoid police checkpoints with the help of spotters on cellphones. Its impossible for Laura to know whats happening around her whats going to happen next or whos on which side. In fact she wouldnt have been forced into doing the gangs bidding if she hadnt enlisted the help of a crooked cop. ""Miss Bala"" is a portrait of a young woman who is at once terribly vulnerable and improbably brave. Its equally a vision of a vulnerable society on the road to anarchy. Coriolanus In taking on one of Shakespeares more opaque plays for his directorial debut Ralph Fiennes emulates the hero he portrays a refractory Roman general Caius Martius ""Coriolanus"" for whom compromise equals surrender. But Martius comes to a bad end while Mr. Fiennes achieves a great beginning. As a director his grasp exceeds his daring reach and his performance stands as a chilling exemplar of psychomartial ferocity. The setting is contemporary give or take a decade. Ancient Rome has become a modern city where hungry citizens rioting for grain are dispersed by troops wielding automatic weapons and where TV news shows broadcast frequent updates of the Roman armys bloody campaign against its Volscian enemies--if it bleeds it leads indeed. But Shakespeares English is still spoken with a clarity that results from the pace that Mr. Fiennes has set for himself and his fellow actors--deliberate sometimes to the point of verbal slo-mo yet so charged with feeling as to sound like conversation that only happens to flow forth in iambic pentameter. The modern dress works well. What might have been a stunt emphasizes the military aspects of the play--those automatic weapons dont exclude mano a mano combat with knives--and intensifies the domestic drama that might have seemed more remote had it been cloaked in gowns and togas. Thats not to suggest that the film is instantly accessible. It takes a while assuming a willingness to invest the effort before you can tune into the marvelous language then get beyond it to concentrate on revelations of character. But riches of character are revealed with copious visual invention. (The cinematographer Barry Ackroyd who shot last weeks thriller ""Contraband"" fills ""Coriolanus"" with startling images.) Mr. Fienness Martius head shaven and covered with blood becomes a cautionary character a rigid soldier ill-suited to civic affairs. Martius takes pleasure in his towering vanity refuses to conceal his scorn for the common people hates his enemies with a naked passion that inspires awe. The cast includes Vanessa Redgrave as the heros mother Volumnia alongside whom todays tiger moms seem toothless; Jessica Chastain as his ardent wife Virgilia; Gerard Butler as Tullus Aufidius his mortal enemy and Brian Cox as the accommodating senator Menenius. They are superb every one of them. Red Tails Watch a clip of Cuba Gooding Jr.s latest film ""Red Tails"". A crew of African American pilots in the Tuskegee training program having faced segregation while kept mostly on the ground during World War II are called into duty under the guidance of Col. A.J. Bullard. No story from World War II is more deserving of a great movie than that of the Tuskegee Airmen. A squadron of Negro fighter pilots they struggled against white prejudice for a chance to prove themselves in combat and succeeded brilliantly winning nearly 100 Distinguished Flying Crosses. Then they returned to civilian life in a nation still gripped by Jim Crow. Few stories have followed a longer path to the big screen than ""Red Tails"" which was ignored by the studios for decades until according to its producer George Lucas he decided to make it with his own money. The end result is not a great movie but a deeply misconceived one that tells the story with a comic-book sensibility--""Die you foolish African"" snarls a Messerschmitt pilot--and a videogame approach to the visual effects. (Anthony Hemingway directed broadly from a truly foolish script by John Ridley and Aaron McGruder. Terrence Howard and Cuba Gooding Jr. head the cast.) One could argue that the target audience--black teenagers Mr. Lucas has said--might be most receptive to a film that conveys history through contemporary entertainment. But this isnt contemporary entertainment its antiquated kitsch reprocessed by the producers nostalgia for the movies of his boyhood. The story has been stripped of historical context--dont black teenagers and everyone else deserve hard facts?--and internal logic. (How for example are the initially demoralized and undisciplined members of the squadron able to best the Luftwaffe in early encounters?) Whats left is a collection of war-movie cliches; a wartime Italian setting that looks weirdly idyllic if not quite prosperous; sappy interludes of romance between one of the fliers and a pretty village girl; a hapless borrowing from ""Stalag 17"" and computer-generated aerial sequences that in their whiz-bang wondrousness have lost every connection with authenticity. DVD Focus ENLARGE The Limey (1999) Steven Soderbergh directed and Lem Dobbs wrote this slyly funny spasmodically violent film noir in which the title character a white-haired obsessive named Wilson (Terence Stamp) shows up in Los Angeles to avenge his daughters death. Like Elliott Goulds Philip Marlowe in ""The Long Goodbye"" Wilson cant comprehend the glittering new culture that surrounds him mistaking valet car-parkers for uniformed troops in a gangsters private army. I couldnt comprehend how the star was able to look as young as he did in flashbacks of Wilson in his twenties. See the film first then search online for the secret. Richard III (1995) This rousing version directed by Richard Loncraine relocates the play to a fictional fascist England of the mid-1930s that suggests some surreal convergence of Sir Oswald Mosleys blackshirts with the sumptuous decadence of Bernardo Bertoluccis ""The Conformist."" Ian McKellen makes Richards malignity sexy. His voice may not be as oaken as Richard Burtons was or as burnished as John Gielguds but its a beautifully modulated instrument with its own somber music. His long face punctuated by a pencil mustache is a place of jowls creases and inflammation. Also with Maggie Smith Nigel Hawthorne Kristin Scott Thomas and Robert Downey Jr. Battle of Britain (1969) As historical drama its imperfect but watch the phenomenal aerial sequences and youll see whats missing from the digital effects in ""Red Tails."" This production under the direction of Guy Hamilton pulled together a veritable international air force of authentic airplanes in flying condition--British Spitfires and Hurricanes versus German Messerschmitt 109s Heinkel 111s and Junkers 52s. The cast is fairly dazzling too--Michael Caine Trevor Howard Laurence Olivier Christopher Plummer Harry Andrews Curt Jurgens Michael Redgrave Ralph Richardson Robert Shaw Kenneth More and Susannah York to name just a notable few.

""The Limey"" Steven Soderberghs new crime picture continues the helmers artistic renewal evident last year in the superbly realized ""Out of Sight."" Pics most interesting element is the positioning of two icons of 1960s cinema the very British Terence Stamp and the very American Peter Fonda as longtime enemies in whats basically a routine revenge thriller. Artisan release lacks the playful mood and deliciously romantic angle of ""Out of Sight"" but with the right marketing pic will play reasonably well mainly with mature viewers. Precisely 10 years after he won the Palme dOr for his superb feature debut ""sex lies and videotape"" Soderbergh is back in Cannes with an out-of-competition selection that shows again his ability to take a routine crime meller and make it an accomplished piece of filmmaking that overcomes its routine elements. The slim underdeveloped script by Lem Dobbs who also wrote Soderberghs disappointing sophomore effort ""Kafka"" promises more than it delivers and is occasionally pretentious and not very engaging. While ""Out of Sight"" employed stylistic devices associated with 1970s cinema ""The Limey"" pays homage to and is full of allusions to 1960s international cinema a feeling accentuated by the casting of Fonda and Stamp. First line heard on a black screen is from middle-aged Wilson (Stamp) ""Tell me about Jenny."" Leaving London for the first time after nine years behind bars  Wilson (Stamp) arrives in L.A. to unravel the mystery surrounding the death of his daughter. Stamps Wilson is an outsider an ex-con whos totally out of touch with the new world including the crime milieu its lingo and subculture. First scenes are excellent in establishing Wilsons alienation. A solitary figure in a lousy motel he spends his time chain-smoking while reading newspaper clippings about Jenny who died under mysterious circumstances according to a letter he received from a man called Ed (Luis Guzman). After initial hesitations Ed also a former criminal becomes Wilsons partner and buddy. The only clue Wilson has is that Jenny was involved in a love affair with Valentine (Fonda) an affluent record producer who owns a spectacular house in the Hollywood Hills where he now carries on an affair with Adhara (Amelia Heinle) a young beautiful girl whos roughly Jennys age. In an early set piece Wilson dressed entirely in black goes to a warehouse in downtown L.A. where he is brutally beaten and kicked out with the honchos taking his gun. Nonetheless he coolly pulls out another gun hidden under his belt and returns to the spot shooting most of the people in a visually gripping scene in which a stationary camera waits outside while shots are heard on the soundtrack. Later episodes link Wilson with the graceful Elaine (a splendid Lesley Ann Warren) an aging actress who knew Jenny. A relationship (but no romance) evolves during which Wilson has to face his irresponsible conduct as a father. At first it seems that ""The Limey"" is yet another variation of ""Hardcore"" in which a Calvinist Midwestern father journeys into the sleazy nether world of porn in search of his missing teenage daughter. But Soderbergh is too smart and modernist a filmmaker to follow that path. Helmer must have realized that the script lacks dramatic momentum for he structures the whole film around his two central characters. Narrative actually resembles a Western in which two aging criminals must face the rapidly changing conditions around them and must come to terms with their own identity -- and mortality. The problem with the script is that it lacks secondary characters and subplots to enrich the unraveling of the chief mystery. The film also suffers from unfolding as a series of set pieces that dont build much continuity or excitement. Similarly there is no emotional payoff in the final confrontation between Wilson and Valentine. Soderbergh has used Dobbs script to make a contemplative character-driven drama that underplays the familiar crime genre and underworld milieu in favor of a more resonant story about family and intergenerational issues. In this respect  ""The Limey"" is a revenge thriller almost in spite itself. Ed Lachmans subtle use of light and inventive framing of space and Sarah Flacks astute cutting and smooth transitions between past and present elevate ""The Limey"" way above its text. A key scene alludes to Stamps landmark late-60s movies Wylers ""The Collector"" and Pasolinis ""Teorema."" Indeed the two lead performances mirror key roles Stamp and Fonda have played in the past 30 years. Soderbergh uses extensive footage from Ken Loachs 1967 film ""Poor Cow"" in which Stamp played a young thief named perhaps not so coincidentally Wilson. While there is no explicit reference to a particular Fonda picture watching him here inevitably brings to mind all of his oeuvre including his most recent triumph in ""Ulees Gold."" Whatever deficiencies critics may find in the overextended monologues (mostly by Stamp) and terse often oblique dialogue (mostly Fonda and his entourage) one has no problem praising the bravura acting of the entire ensemble and the pics impressive technical aspects. Warren Guzman and Barry Newman give maturely restrained performances in line with the films dominant texture. A supporting turn by Joe Dallessandro an Andy Warhol and Paul Morrissey favorite accentuates pics reflexive nature as a commentary on a bygone era of filmmaking.

Starring Terence Stamp and Peter Fonda. Directed by Steven Soderbergh. Written by Lem Dobbs. (R. 87 minutes.) ""The Limey"" is a first-rate crime thriller and further proof that director Stephen Soderbergh is one of our great contemporary film stylists. Taut imaginative and complex this is one of the best American films of 1999. Terence Stamp plays Wilson a brutal British thug just out of prison who flies to Los Angeles to avenge his daughters death. Nothing is quite what it seems to be and the film is told from inside Stamps head -- riding a wobbly line between past and present delusion and Stamps fevered thoughts. Theres nothing orderly nothing linear in the way Soderbergh constructs this tale. Information comes at us in shards and little blips from odd directions. Audaciously the film cuts in shots of Stamp in ""Poor Cow"" a film he made with director Ken Loach in 1967 and uses them to create a hazy back story -- to suggest the roots of Stamps crazed amoral character in this film. Its a great idea and it works. ""The Limey"" is a triumph of style but also a great showcase for older underused actors. Soderbergh resur rects the still-vital rudely funny Stamp and gives wonderful moments to Peter Fonda Lesley Ann Warren and Barry Newman. ..

"Limey The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; limey-the ) Limey The (United States 1999) A movie review by James Berardinelli Terence Stamp is The Limey and The Limey is Terence Stamp. Forget about everything else in this film - the supporting cast which features Lesley Ann Warren Luis Guzman and Peter Fonda Steven Soderberghs lively direction and even Lem Dobbs screenplay. Without Stamps bravura performance there is no movie. With it even the thinnest premise ignites the screen with white-hot passion and energy. Stamp has done some wonderful work in a long and varied career. This is not his best film but it may be the most forceful acting he has ever accomplished. Approximately 10 years ago Steven Sodergergh burst onto the independent movie scene with the force of a supernova. His debut feature sex lies and videotape almost singlehandedly put the Sundance Film Festival on the map. Overnight Park Citys winter gathering of movie-lovers was transformed from a minor event into a major seller and buyers market. Since then Soderbergh has done some very good pictures (King of the Hill Out of Sight) but nothing that has attracted a big box office return. The Limey will more than likely fall into the same category. The movie is a visceral thriller - a stylish take on the revenge picture. Call it the art film version of Death Wish. There really isnt anything deeper or more meaningful going on here. However done right as it is here this kind of film can be immensely entertaining and satisfying. When Stamps Wilson finds out that his daughter Jenny has been killed by American drug dealers he crosses the Atlantic and goes on a one-man killing spree knocking off one target after another as he gets close to the bulls-eye Jennys lover pop music producer Terry Valentine (Peter Fonda playing the sleazy part with relish). The Limey possesses several traits that allow it to work better than the average revenge thriller. The first in Stamps performance which blazes with intensity and energy. The actors work here isnt just scene-stealing its movie-stealing. The second is Soderberghs style which includes flashbacks and flashforwards with dialogue from one scene often bleeding into its successor. The third is the brilliant snappy dialogue which often sounds scripted but is delightful nevertheless. And the fourth is the sense of macabre offbeat humor that suffuses the picture reminding us not to take anything that transpires too seriously. The film moves. It has color energy life and pizzazz - all three in abundance. And above all it has Stamp who in a just world would be guaranteed some kind of recognition at Oscar time. (Given the way the nomination process has worked in the past few years nothing is certain.) For Soderbergh this movie is about as far away from the low key drama of sex lies and videotape as anything he has done. If The Limey had been a little less well-made Id call it a guilty pleasure. But because it has been crafted with a great deal of attention and care Ill drop the ""guilty"" and simply call it a ""pleasure.""

""Tell me. Tell me about Jenny"" a Cockney voice demands before the picture even rolls. The yoiky vowels belong to Wilson (Terence Stamp) the down-market Briton of the title (limey being old slang for British sailors who sucked citrus at sea to prevent scurvy). Jenny was Wilsons daughter who lived with oil-slick record producer Valentine (Peter Fonda) high in the Hollywood Hills and died under circumstances her father doesnt believe were accidental. The ice-eyed ex-cons assault on the scurviness of Jennys adopted town the steady focus with which he tracks ever-shifting Hollywood sleaze in pursuit of whoever harmed his girl is the whole story. But what a storyteller With a compact efficient plot (stranger comes to town to avenge stranger avenges stranger leaves town) a dazzling diamond-cut script by Lem Dobbs (who also wrote the screenplay for the directors Kafka) and a great jazz combo of a supporting cast (including Luis Guzman Lesley Ann Warren Barry Newman and Nicky Katt) Soderbergh extends the shape-shifting that distinguished Out of Sight skipping and backtracking repeating scenes and restaging them. Emphasizing Wilson-the-outsiders learning curve each new vista brings more information. And more fun more downright zingy fun In dozens of sharp exchanges all of five sentences each director and screenwriter manage to nail -- but not disdain -- upscale and underclass Angelenos alike with cool glee. (One perfect snapshot Wilsons introduction to valet parking.) Of course the fun too is in watching white-haired Stamp his face a mask of sangfroid playing creatively not only with fellow 60s survivor Fonda but also with our own memories of the actors exquisite younger self. In The Limeys cheekiest and loveliest slicing and dicing of time Soderbergh inserts footage from Poor Cow Ken Loachs 1967 feature debut in which Stamp played a beautiful thief -- named Wilson -- who goes to jail and who has a daughter. Delicately inserting moments from Stamps legendary movie past into a film set in the present that ought very much to enhance the stars future is Soderberghs most gracious and elegant painterly detail in this wonderful composition.
