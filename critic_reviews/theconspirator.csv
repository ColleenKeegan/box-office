Earning an automatic nix was any script in which characters wore top hats or other period dress. Historical dramas have always been a tough sell. Oh sure theres ""The Kings Speech"" but unless youre handing Mel Gibson a musket and calling it ""The Patriot"" or painting him blue for ""Braveheart"" its hard to get the masses to turn out. For one thing when folks go to the megaplex they want to be entertained not returned to the classroom. And if they want to watch historical reenactments there are already plenty to watch on the History Channel from the comfort their Lazy Boy. And thats too bad because there are not just lessons to be learned from history but parallels to be drawn. The tricky part is to do it in a way that a contemporary audience can relate to and understand while involving them in the characters and story being told. Thats the task facing Steven Spielberg as he embarks on ""Lincoln"" starring Daniel Day-Lewis as the nations 16th President which is scheduled to begin filming this fall. Its also one director Robert Redford wrestles with only half-successfully in ""The Conspirator""  in theaters this weekend. This dutiful historical drama takes place in the immediate aftermath of the 1985 assassination of Lincoln -- eight conspirators are quickly rounded up and arrested (the actual assassin actor John Wilkes Booth was fatally shot during his attempted capture 12 days after the murder). One of the conspirators is Mary Surratt (played by Robin Wright) a widow who had run a boarding house in Washington D.C. in which the conspirators met. If shes found guilty during a trial before a military tribunal she faces the gallows. Drafted to defend her is a decorated Union Army officer Frederick Aiken (James McAvoy). The young lawyer is initially reluctant to take Surratts case since hes repulsed by the crime and figures shes guilty. But as the trial begins it becomes increasingly clear to him that theres reason to believe she may be innocent. Whats more in the governments rush placate public outrage at the assassination with swift convictions her Constitutional rights are being ignored and suspended. One would have to have been napping for the past decade not to pick up on the glaring parallels to Guantanamo and the U.S. militarys on-going trials of accused terrorists. The movie starts off a jumbled mess as it depicts Lincolns assassination and the attempted ones on the Vice President Andrew Johnson and Secretary of State William Seward and then the subsequent capture of the conspirators. But as it narrows its focus to Aitkins efforts to save Surratt ""Conspirator"" gains dramatic heft and draws a viewer in. By the time it reaches -- spoiler ahead for anyone who failed American History 101 -- its inevitable tragic end its really quite moving. The biggest hitch is the plodding screenplay by James Solomon (""The Bronx is Burning"") which reminds one of episodes from that earnest vintage TV re-enactment series ""Profiles in Courage."" Redford gets strong performances from McAvoy and Wright and amusingly hammy ones from Tom Wilkinson as a crafty senator and Kevin Kline as Edwin Stanton the bellicose secretary of war. Watching Kline thunder away I kept thinking how perfect hed be as Lyndon Baines Johnson pulling on his dogs ears and complaining that America didnt love him. Now theres a historical drama Id be happy to sit through. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

In the aftermath eight conspirators are charged with plotting to murder the President Vice-President and Secretary of State. The lone woman among them Mary Surratt (Robin Wright) owns a boarding house where John Wilkes Booth and his accomplices met to plan the attacks. Her son John was also allegedly part of the conspiracy though he conveniently vanished after the killings. Twenty-seven-year-old war hero and lawyer Frederic Aiken (James McAvoy) reluctantly consents to defend Mary when her Southern attorney (Maryland Senator Reverdy Johnson played by Tom Wilkinson) convinces him she needs a Yankee soldier on her side for any hope of a fair trial especially since shes a civilian being tried by a military tribunal. While Johnson deems it an unconstitutional ""travesty"" war secretary Stanton (Kevin Kline) and his paranoid supporters think only of swift justice for sake of the nations survival. Despite declaring victory theres enough Confederate rebellion and intrigue afoot in addition to the presidents death that theyre rightfully worried the war wont stay won. Like most Lincoln supporters Aiken is sure Marys guilty and believes helping her betrays his country. He smirks with hatred and distrust when she denies being an assassin during their first jail cell interview. Yet his compassion and sense of justice gets the better of him as he soon realizes the military tribunal and its prosecutor Holt (Danny Huston) decided Marys fate long before the trial began and will do whatever it takes (bribery coercion) to make sure they get the outcome they demand either Marys head in a noose or her sons. Aiken does his best aided by Marys daughter Anna (Evan Rachel Wood) to raise enough reasonable doubt to save her and for his reward is ostracized by his peers and girlfriend Sarah (Alexis Bledel). Much of the details around the trial especially the most damming testimony draws from actual historical accounts. Iconic images like Lincolns portrait wreathed on the black train carrying his corpse or merchants hawking Lincoln memorabilia outside the military prison; evoke an authentic sense of time and place. Director Robert Redford also effectively uses every cinematic trick at his disposal -- dim lighting disconcerting perspectives to convey the sense of doom mourning confusion and hysteria that engulfed the wounded young country in the dark days after Lincolns loss. Behind-the-action close ups of stabbings seem disturbingly more violent than the bloody thrusts you regularly witness in other modern movies. Similarly the cameras low first-person perspective of men bearing the fallen leader through a tide of terrified bystanders amplifies the feeling of disorientation and panic. Though everyone in the cast plays their parts well McAvoy Wright and Wood most poignantly and brilliantly put a face to the echoing despair anger and desperation that prevails over their legal battle. A courtroom drama staged not to expose Marys guilt or innocence but that of her judges. Atmospheric illuminating and affecting The Conspirator captivates like an untold story--one that you cant believe youve never heard until now and wont soon forget.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Apr. 29 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 241PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English What everyone knows about the assassination of Abraham Lincoln amounts to the movie-trailer version of the real story The actor/assassin John Wilkes Booth shoots the U.S. president in a theatre box leaps to the stage and declares "" Sic semper tyrannis"" before making his escape stage right to his waiting horse. Movies The Conspirator The official trailer The most welcome part of Robert Redfords new movie The Conspirator is that it fills in some of the corners and backdrop to that vignette placing Booth as the ringleader of a group of rebel-sympathizing conspirators who set out to kill not only the president but vice-president and secretary of state in a virtual coup detat. As might be expected from Redford ( Quiz Show Lions for Lambs) The Conspirator bears the familiar stamp of Hollywood quality a stirring political tale a cast of English and American prestige actors well-researched locations and costumes illuminated in buttery lamp-lit interiors. For the first half hour the movie even moves fairly briskly. Frederick Aiken (James McAvoy) is a young lawyer turned Union captain who we first meet showing his dedication to his men in the aftermath of a bloody battle. Two years later back in Washington Aiken is about to return to civilian life with his pretty socialite fiancee (Alexis Bledel). Then comes the shooting of the president at Fords Theatre and everything changes. The assassination the death of Booth in a shootout and the roundup of the conspirators happen in quick tableaux followed by a montage of newspaper headlines declaring the nation in a state of shock and grief. The secretary of war Edwin Stanton (Kevin Kline) takes charge issues commands and sets the wheels in motion for a national show trial. The reluctant Aiken ready to slip into soft civil life is ordered by his superior Southern senator Reverdy Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) to defend the most controversial of the conspirators Forty-two-year-old Mary Surratt (Robin Wright) mother of one of the accused men and tied tangentially to the case as the landlady of a boarding house where the others met. As the trial starts the initially unready Aiken scores a few lucky points and then discovers that his role in the trial is to lose. The military tribunal presided over by General David Hunter (Colm Meaney) works hand-in-hand with the unctuous prosecutor Joseph Holt (Danny Huston) while the real strings are being pulled by Stanton. The fix is also in for the movie. As the de facto leader Kline staring coldly through his spectacles holds his mouth with a distinctly Dick Cheney-esque sneer one of the many indications that the fix is also in for the drama. Redford and screenwriter James Solomon are not subtle in drawing parallels between the post-Civil War crackdown and the post-9/11 dismissal of individual rights (especially in Guantanamo) for the sake of national security. Once the ideological cat is out of the bag the drama is degraded to the level of a historical pageant. With Redford and Solomon having seized command of the thinking functions for the audience what remains is the lesser pleasure of watching the actors go through their paces The scruffy cast of conspirators essentially provides more set decor - they have almost nothing to say. The veteran actors in the ensemble (Meaney Kline Wilkinson) play their one-note roles with stagey professionalism. In contrast Wrights performance as the wan martyr blinking in the sunlight is so internalized she barely registers. The one happy surprise is Evan Rachel Wood vibrant in a small part as Marys tormented daughter Anna forced to choose between loyalty to her mother or her brother. What vigour is left in the movie comes from the congenial though not weighty McAvoy. As the young lawyer hes bipolar from scene to scene with each legal Hail Mary play followed by shocked defeat in the face of what amounts to evidence of a new conspiracy - the government and militarys determination to convict by any means. Though the Bush-era parallels are at the forefront Redford hasnt moved too far here from an earlier political-thriller template With its skulduggery late-night meetings and the contemptuous political cabal out to thwart justice The Conspirator can be thought of as All the Presidents Men - The Lincoln Edition.

Special to Newsday + - Robin Wright in a scene from "" The Conspirator"" directed by Robert Redford  tells a powerful and true story about America then and now. In theatres on April 15 2011. ( Roadside Attractions) Photo Credit Roadside Attractions/ advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Lincolns been shot the countrys in panic the Constitutions in peril. BOTTOM LINE Director Robert Redford puts national morality center stage in this film. CAST James McAvoy Robin Wright Kevin Kline Tom Wilkinson LENGTH 203 The guilt or innocence of Mary Surratt -- the boardinghouse owner under whose roof was hatched the plot to murder Abraham Lincoln -- doesnt really matter so much in Robert Redfords ""The Conspirator"" a bracing courtroom drama whose every scene seems wreathed in mist dust motes and cigar smoke the better to suggest a nation befogged by grief. Surratt (Robin Wright) whose son John was unquestionably one of John Wilkes Booths confederates was swept up in the raids that followed Lincolns death which also was followed by a constitutional crisis sparked by loss mourning and a fear that the just-finished war might be rekindled by a vengeful North. Its the abandonment of national principle that interests Redford and screenwriter James Solomon too. And all their pointed references -- to military tribunals hooded suspects loyalty oaths and the haste to ""put it behind us"" justice be damned -- make for a period piece with contemporary echoes. advertisement | advertise on newsday But as often happens when righteous indignation comes in the door finesse flies out the window. Excepting James McAvoys Frederick Aiken Civil War hero and Surratts reluctant lawyer the characters are fairly one-dimensional. Surratt is made near-saintly her eyes weary her rosary clutched her chin upraised against the political winds that are dictating her fate. Secretary of War Edwin Stanton (Kevin Kline) is clearly intended here as the Lincoln administrations Dick Cheney and even though Danny Huston is terrific his prosecutor Joseph Holt is basically Satan with a law degree. McAvoy however holds the thing together making Aiken convincingly torn between his antipathy toward the South his devotion to the law and the insult of his clients trial which is shamelessly fixed. Hes abetted by Redford who despite a lack of subtlety in the characterizations shows hes still got the directing chops as well as a healthy sense of political outrage.

"Educational Conspirator is a bit stuffy - USATODAY.com Skip to Main Content USA TODAY Subscribe Mobile Home News Travel Money Sports Life Your Life Tech Weather Educational Conspirator is a bit stuffy By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Updated | | Share Reprints amp; PermissionsThe Conspirator brings to life a little-known chapter in American history hinged on an unsettling military trial. By Claudette Barius The American Film Company Robin Wright stars as Mary Surratt who was tried as a conspirator in the plot to kill Abraham Lincoln. EnlargeClose By Claudette Barius The American Film Company Robin Wright stars as Mary Surratt who was tried as a conspirator in the plot to kill Abraham Lincoln. Though it grabbed national headlines in its day the story of the lone woman charged with conspiracy in the assassination of President Lincoln has seldom been covered in history classes. Most people know about John Wilkes Booths role as Lincolns killer but far fewer know about Mary Surratt and her alleged involvement in the events that led up the assassination. Kudos to director Robert Redford for his effort to educate audiences. Unfortunately this quiet deliberately paced film sometimes feels more stilted and educational than compelling. Theres a stiffness that keeps the story from packing a punch. Still its handsomely mounted and its best moments have the patina of a Masterpiece Theatre production. Surratt is played with a coiled intensity by Robin Wright. In 1865 Surratt ran the Washington boardinghouse where the plot to kill Lincoln was believed to have been devised. Her son John (Johnny Simmons) was allegedly one of the co-conspirators. But after Lincolns death John Surratt disappeared. Officials put Mary on trial in some part because John could not be found. That she was a woman refusing to submit information in a male-dominated society added fuel to their fire. The Conspirator    out of four Stars Robin Wright Penn James McAvoy Tom Wilkinson Evan Rachel Wood Kevin Kline Director Robert Redford Distributor Roadside Attractions Rating PG-13 for some violent content Running time 2 hours 2 minutes Opens nationwide Friday Redford methodically presents the injustices piled on Surratt and suggests what might have prompted her stoicism. But James D. Solomons script is often flat perhaps in a misguided effort to be stately. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

By Peter Rainer Film critic April 15 2011 Save for later Saved Robin Wright (l.) portrays Mary Surratt and James McAvoy portrays lawyer Frederick Aiken in a scene from The Conspirator. Claudette Barius/Roadside Attractions/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Robert Redfords workmanlike ""The Conspirator"" is about Mary Surratt (Robin Wright) a Confederate sympathizer who was executed for her complicity which she denied in the plot to assassinate Abraham Lincoln. Tried in a military court as a civilian along with eight other alleged conspirators she became the first woman to be executed by the United States federal government.When we are first introduced to Mary her lawyer Union war hero Frederick Aiken (James McAvoy) believing she is guilty is reluctant to take her case. As the proprietor of a boarding house where John Wilkes Booth and his other collaborators including her son John (Johnny Simmons) met regularly her claims of innocence initially ring hollow.But Frederick delves deeper and doubts are raised as are his hackles when he discovers that Mary at the instigation of Secretary of War Edwin Stanton (Kevin Kline) is being railroaded. (At the time of her trial her son had not yet been captured and she was among things a convenient scapegoat.) Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Mary is unmistakably being utilized by Redford and his screenwriter James Solomon as a stand-in for post-9/11 victimization. He makes it clear that the post-Civil War mood inflamed by the assassination was ripe for rabble-rousing and the suspension of civil liberties - the liberties that soldiers like Frederick fought and died for. The images of the conspirators in the courthouse with their heads hooded in canvas bags summons up Abu Ghraib. Stanton is placed in the same strongman continuum as Dick Cheney. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? The supposed contemporaneity of Surratts story - the equating of Booths cronies with Gitmo prisoners - is more than a bit of a stretch and Redford doesnt give enough credence to the justifiable hysteria that ordinary Americans felt at the time. Essentially ""The Conspirator"" is a courtroom drama with occasional bulletins from the outside world. It plays out to its predictable end with the doggedness if not the verve of a ""Law and Order"" episode.Still the nightmare of Lincolns assassination and its immediate aftermath is effectively delivered and Wright shrouded in black her face a mask of indomitable sorrow gives great gravity to what might otherwise have been a waxworks historical reenactment.

James McAvoy as the Civil War veteran who defends Surratt has an avid presence but the movie is stiff-jointed and dull.

Whose Side Are You On? Credit Roadside Attractions Please Wait Please Wait Credit Roadside Attractions Abandoning The Constitution Is Not The Answer Abandoning The Constitution Is Not The Answer Credit Roadside Attractions A better history lesson than it is a drama The Conspirator acknowledges the 150th anniversary of the American Civil War in a studious almost reverent mode. History buffs will recognize the name of Mary Surratt the title character but many Americans have heard only of her more notorious acquaintance John Wilkes Booth. Robert Redfords movie is mostly courtroom procedural telling two interlaced stories. One is about how the U.S. government rushed a few suspects before a military tribunal in an attempt to avenge Abraham Lincolns assassination. The other is the more intimate tale of how a young lawyer fresh out of his Union army uniform was pressed to defend Surratt -- and came to respect her. Historical records being what they are the filmmakers are forced to speculate about certain things but where facts are known they generally adhere to them. The script doesnt add much to whats known about Surratt (Robin Wright) a Southern sympathizer who may have been arrested simply because the government couldnt capture her son. But it inflates the nobility of lawyer Frederick Aiken (James McAvoy) who is portrayed as too high-minded to accept any abuse of due process. The story begins with back-to-back prologues. First Aiken demonstrates his selflessness on the battlefield; next a group of conspirators attacks Lincoln and other officials. Secretary of War Edwin Stanton (Kevin Kline theatrical as usual) pulls an Al Haig He orders subordinates to keep Andrew Johnson soon to be president away from booze; then he rushes to Lincolns side. Stanton will remain in charge until the last appeal is heard -- or prevented from being heard. In the courtroom at Washingtons Fort McNair Aiken faces imperious prosecutor Joseph Holt (Danny Huston) and a hostile tribunal of uniformed officers. Local society is no friendlier. As the case proceeds Aiken is expelled from his gentlemens club and dumped by his fiancee (Alexis Bledel). Meanwhile he is received with contempt by Mary Surratts daughter (an impressively subtle Evan Rachel Wood) at the familys downtown boarding house where some of the conspirators stayed. i Tom Wilkinson (right) plays a Maryland senator whose own political liabilities keep him from defending Surratt -- and who recruits McAvoys Aiken to do the job. Claudette Barius/Roadside Attractions hide caption toggle caption Claudette Barius/Roadside Attractions Tom Wilkinson (right) plays a Maryland senator whose own political liabilities keep him from defending Surratt -- and who recruits McAvoys Aiken to do the job. Claudette Barius/Roadside Attractions Although the outcome of Surratts trial is a matter of public record The Conspirator treats the case as the stuff of a suspense thriller. Outraged by the prosecutions conduct Aiken makes pleas to conscience and seeks a last-minute writ of habeas corpus. Stanton is not amused. Or swayed. Although more movie star than actor himself Redford likes to cast theater-trained performers often those whose native accent is not American. In addition to McAvoy The Conspirator features Briton Tom Wilkinson (as Reverdy Johnson the Maryland senator who recruits Aiken to defend Surratt) and Irishman Colm Meaney (as Gen. David Hunter the leader of the tribunal). It gets a bit distracting. So does the films look. Cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel uses desaturated color to suggest that age has faded the images and presents the stony-faced Surratts prison cell as something out of a Renaissance painting with deep shadows and a near-theological shaft of light. And 1860s Washington played by Savannah looks too Southern and too pretty. Surratts boarding house for example is impersonated by a gracious corner house that faces a tree-filled square. (The real building which still stands has none of these selling points.) Historical niceties aside The Conspirator is also about Guantanamo of course. ""In times of war the law falls silent"" says the prosecutor quoting Cicero. In its final minutes the movie shows that the American justice system returned to normal soon after the South surrendered. But it offers no insights into the consequences of a war that never ends.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.April 14 2011 1003 PM George Bush Killed Abe Lincoln Despite some overly drawn parallels The Conspirator is a gripping historical account. By Dana Stevens Robin Wright and James McAvoy in The Conspirator Robert Redfords The Conspirator (Lionsgate) a courtroom drama about the aftermath of the Lincoln assassination has no business being as entertaining as it is. Less a movie than an extended re-enactment from a History Channel documentary the movie is stagey preachy and long on exposition. Its easy to imagine the bulleted list of questions to be handed out afterwards for high-school civics students to ponder What is a writ of habeas corpus? But once you accustom yourself to this films unhurried rhythm and old-fashioned Hollywood stolidity The Conspirator is not without its pleasures--chief among them Robin Wrights quietly fierce performance as Mary Surratt the mother of one of John Wilkes Booths conspirators who was charged with complicity in their plot to kill the president. The film begins on a Civil War battleground where amid horrific carnage a wounded Union soldier Capt. Frederick Aiken (James McAvoy) struggles to keep his even more seriously injured comrade Nicholas (Justin Long) from slipping toward death. As it turns out both men survive the war and a few years later Aiken is a novice attorney in the employ of Reverdy Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) with Nicholas as his roue drinking partner. As they carouse at a mens club one April night in 1865 word comes that the president has been shot. (Though we only glimpse Lincoln briefly and from a distance the shooting at Fords Theatre is recreated as it appeared in contemporary accounts right down to Booths leap onto the stage the resulting broken leg and his cry of ""Sic semper tyrannis--the South is avenged"") Advertisement While the nation mourns (a development conveyed by touchingly old-school closeups of newspaper headlines reading ""The Nation Mourns"") Aiken finds that his boss has assigned him the unenviable task of defending Mary Surratt a widow who ran the boarding house where the conspirators gathered to hatch their plot. Worse Surratt will be tried before a specially convened wartime tribunal led by a general (Colm Meaney) who seems to be making up the rules of the court as he goes along. It appears that Secretary of War Edwin Stanton (Kevin Kline) has decided that symbolic punishment must be meted out for Lincolns death and if the runaway conspirator John Surratt (Johnny Simmons) cant be found and executed his mother will have to do. Its a tossup whether the parallels Redford draws to the Bush administrations prosecution of the war on terror are more painful for their obviousness or for their lateness. But I found myself forgiving The Conspirator for its clumsy stabs at ideological relevance because the story--the actual facts of what happened to Mary Surratt and to the right to trial by jury--was so damn interesting. If youre up enough on Civil War history to know the facts of the Surratt trial already the last one-third of The Conspirator may feel pokey but my ignorance of Surratts fate had me on the edge of my seat. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Actors who direct like to think of themselves as ""actors directors"" but Redfords coaching of his cast seems uneven with different actors coming at the project from different angles Kevin Klines hammy villain doesnt belong on the same screen as McAvoys understated hero and Justin Long bless his heart should never attempt a period film again--even in full Union regalia he looks like he should be carrying a neoprene backpack. Robin Wright an actress who keeps getting better and more beautiful with age brings a mysterious gravity to the widow Surratt whose allegiances and motivations remain shrouded in mystery right up till the end. As for McAvoy he manages to invest his potentially dull Dudley Do-Right character with mischief and quicksilver intelligence. But between The Last King of Scotland Wanted The Last Station and Atonement hes in danger of becoming typecast as the nice handsome guy to whom other people do awful things. For his next project he should seek out a script in which good and evil arent so easy to tell apart where heroism can coexist with ambiguous or even base motivations. If he wants to hold out for a role like that McAvoy might want to stop taking Robert Redfords calls. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

We should expect no less from Robert Redford who takes seriously (at times earnestly) the duties of director. We could however wish for a film more vivid and epically ambitious on the 150th anniversary of the Civil War. Although ""The Conspirator"" begins on a bloodied battlefield it is an incident of rushed (possibly rough) justice in the aftermath of President Abraham Lincolns assassination that drives the tale. Eight people were charged in the plot to kill the president Secretary of State William H. Seward and Vice President Andrew Johnson. Among them 42-year-old boardinghouse proprietor Mary Surratt. John Wilkes Booth and his cohort -- including Surratts son John -- met at her establishment. A question runs throughout the film How could Mary Surratt not have known what those hushed heated gatherings in her home were about? The more resonant quandary has to do with the behavior of a nation at war -- or just out of it. (Lincoln was shot five days after Gen. Robert E. Lees surrender.) How does a government minister to its people and carry out justice after so grievous a wound? Ten years after 9/11 we still tussle with this challenge. The cast is gifted and determined especially James McAvoy and Robin Wright. Though executed stiffly the films aims are admirable. After a screening a colleague likened it to one of the Philco Television Playhouse productions of the 1940s and 1950s. ""The Conspirator"" is stern thoughtful storytelling. But it could have benefited from a wider focus. Were told the nation grieves that it teeters. Capture that -- even if for a moment. Instead ""The Conspirator"" resorts rather old-fashionedly to the use of newspaper headlines to relay news of the assassination and the plot. And James Solomons script relies too much on the observations of the courtroom players who become less reliable as the military tribunal gets underway. That bias is of course part of the point. McAvoy and Wright have a quiet chemistry as reluctant attorney Frederick Aiken and his even more uneager client. Before he was drafted by Maryland Sen. Reverdy Johnson Aiken had been a Union war hero. He feels his task is a betrayal of his fellow soldiers. And ""The Conspirator"" does measured work with his and Surratts oh-so- tentative trust. Tom Wilkinson and Kevin Kline square off as statesmen Johnson and Edward Stanton the secretary of war. Early in the film Stanton mutters an aside about ""that woman"" as Mary Todd Lincoln sobs over the body of her husband. Hes far from sentimental. And Kline has the difficult job of conveying Stantons position. The war has ended but the clashing sentiments that led to it remain. ""This is a frightened country"" Stanton states. He wants a trial that will quell the anger of a grieving nation on the one hand and send a unequivocal message to the defeated Confederacy on the other. Joseph Holt is Stantons proxy in court. And Danny Huston portrays the prosecutor with a superior certainty that has become a trademark -- and bane -- for the actor. The more Aiken takes his task seriously the more he becomes persona non grata among peers and friends. Even his beloved Sarah (Alexis Bledel) tries but cannot grasp why he accepted the assignment. Evan Rachel Wood (HBOs ""Mildred Pierce"") portrays Anna Surratt. Prickly like her mother she doesnt make it easy to feel sympathy for the Surratt women. They are undaunted in their belief in the Confederate cause. But Aikens first meeting with the daughter captures the competing hurts of personal persecution and national grief. What stays once the movie ends is Wrights powerful portrayal. That and the sense that the rule of law for a nation is akin to a loved one having a Do Not Resuscitate order. We have both of these things so that faced with chaos and loss survivors can hew to a clear and just path even in our pain.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> The Complete Archive Over 20 Years of Peter Travers Movie Reviews Now Online The conspirator in question is Mary Surratt (a stoic superb Robin Wright) the only woman charged in the murder of Lincoln. Mary owned the boarding house where John Wilkes Booth (Toby Kebbell) and others including her son John (Johnny Simmons) met to plot the presidents murder. Was Mary also the mother of Anna (Evan Rachel Wood) guilty as well? The movie provides no definitive answer. Neither did Mary who went to the gallows pleading her innocence but refusing to rat on her son the only conspirator to escape the authorities. Get more news reviews and interviews from Peter Travers on The Travers Take Redford working from a provocative if sometimes plodding script by first-timer James Solomon deftly weaves a tapestry of the forces at play in a torn country. Kevin Kline excels as Edwin Stanton Lincolns friend and secretary of war. Like Bush after 9/11 Stanton wanted a rush to justice. Mary was tried in a military court. Her attorney Union war hero Frederick Aiken (James McAvoy) reluctantly takes the case at the insistence of Southern senator Reverdy Johnson (the peerless Tom Wilkinson). The film pivots on McAvoys powerfully implosive performance as a man trying to grow beyond his own prejudices. His scenes with Wright under Redfords nuanced guidance give this film its timely resonance and its grieving heart.

Civilian detainees held in solitary hooded facing military tribunals -- their rights abridged because the nation has been shocked by a historic act of violence and is terrified that others are on the way. Welcome to America 1865. Set in the immediate aftermath of Abraham Lincolns assassination this is ""The Conspirator"" all about how a traumatized nation tried to find closure to a tragedy and peace of mind about a surprising threat. And since its directed by Robert Redford -- well its not really about the past at all. Instead Redford -- whose last directorial effort the awkwardly talky ""Lions for Lambs"" looked at the war in Afghanistan -- clearly wants us to think about our modern war on terror and how in our pursuit of villains we may be vandalizing our own principles. The analogy to 9/11 is an imperfect one. The conspirators in the Lincoln assassination were all citizens (and the Supreme Court affirmed -- belatedly -- that their rights had been abridged). Nor were there subsequent attacks that kept the nation constantly on edge. (Other heinous plots -- including a primitive kind of biological warfare -- turned out to be mere fantasy.) Yet Redfords intent is clear and his point -- about the value of our Constitution and the price of national security -- worthy of discussion. It always has been -- ever since Benjamin Franklin first observed ""Those who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety."" Too bad then that Redford never a visual filmmaker cant give this film any snap. Staged flatly on obvious sets it has the cramped low-budget look of those docudramas that used to abound on 70s TV Faithful recreations of national crises or military trials that ended up being assigned as homework in middle school. Luckily Redford always has appreciated performers and he has a very fine one here in Robin Wright playing the chief character Mary Surratt in whose boarding house the assassins met. Was she part of the plot? So said the government -- and put her on trial for her life. Wright who has been doing great and largely unrecognized work for years is terrific as the hard handsome difficult defendant as is James McAvoy as her reluctant defense counsel. Their back-and-forth conversations and McAvoys attempts to get her a fair hearing in court are the heart of the story. And there are some other good performances surrounding it. Like Kevin Kline as coldly determined Secretary of War Edwin Stanton resolved to punish somebody -- anybody -- for the presidents murder. And Evan Rachel Wood as Surratts daughter caught between obedience and worry. Working together with only a few false notes (one being Justin Long as a barely convincing officer) they help push the drama past its stage-bound watch-it-its-good-for-you roots and turn it into something more -- a story of justice a tale of vengeance. And an illustration of how the two rarely sit together in the courtroom. Ratings note The film contains violence. The Conspirator (PG-13) Roadside Attractions (123 min.) Directed by Robert Redford.

Starring Alexis Bledel Justin Long James McAvoy Evan Rachel Wood Robin Wright Jonathan Groff Danny Huston Kevin Kline Toby Kebbell Norman Reedus Director Robert Redford Running time 202 Release Opened Apr 15 2011  Editorial Review An overreaching Civil War dramaBy Ann HornadayFriday April 15 2011For several years now Robin Wright has been delivering small but indelible performances in movies that usually feature her as a supporting player. In ""The Conspirator"" Robert Redfords absorbing if puzzling Civil War-era drama Wright announces in no uncertain terms that she is back and more than ready for her close-up.Wright plays Mary Surratt who in 1865 was accused of conspiring with John Wilkes Booth and others to assassinate Abraham Lincoln and mount a coup against members of his Cabinet including Vice President Andrew Johnson.When she was hanged a few months later Surratt went down in history as the first woman to be executed by the U.S. government -- made all the more notable by doubts as to her guilt in ensuing years.The historical consensus has since concluded that Surratt who ran the boarding house where many of the conspirators met and whose son John was a Confederate spy and crony of Booths was indeed guilty. But for there to be a movie Redford must play up the ambiguity -- in ""The Conspirator"" he portrays Surratt as a pious Catholic devoted mother and finally martyr to overreaching military powers eager to trample on constitutional rights and due process in order to exact revenge in a domestic war on terror.If that rhetoric sounds familiar its on purpose Redford clearly intends ""The Conspirator"" to be an Iraq War allegory right down to the Abu Ghraib-like bags the Feds put over Surratts head while shes locked up in a military prison. But the drama works best when Redford sticks to the story -- little known over the years -- which grows only more piquant when Surratt is defended by the former Union soldier Frederick Aiken (James McAvoy).Handsomely produced its characters often bathed in beams of diaphanous dust-infused light ""The Conspirator"" features outstanding performances in roles that while drawn from history have clearly been shaped to resonate with recent public figures. Kevin Klines war secretary Edwin Stanton bears an uncanny resemblance to Donald Rumsfeld (right down to the wire-rim glasses). Danny Huston as the Union prosecutor could be quoting from the major works of John Yoo and David Addington as he justifies trying civilians and limiting rules of evidence in a military court.But the prime reason to see ""The Conspirator"" is Wright who refuses to soften Surratts prickly character despite Redfords attempts to make her a victim. With her hair darkened and severely pulled back her face a mask of stony implacability Wright delivers a simple unshowy performance that never begs for the audiences sympathy.That cant be said of Redford who as a liberal reconciliationist to the end tortures history and meaning himself. At one point Surratt -- whose staunch support of the Confederacy is indisputable -- tells Aiken that they were both fighting for something larger than themselves. ""Were the same"" she says. Well no. He was fighting to preserve the Union and she supported those who wanted to destroy it to preserve their right to enslave people. Other than that Mrs. Lincoln ""The Conspirator"" illuminates a fascinating chapter of an era that 150 year later still transfixes confounds and divides us.Contains some violent content.

Robin Wright plays the woman convicted in the plot to kill President Lincoln.       Photo Everett Collection / Everett Col Robin Wright and James McAvoy in ""The Conspirator."" Arriving the same week as the 150th anniversary of the start of the Civil War Robert Redfords ""The Conspirator"" is an absorbing drama that depicts the wrenching conflicts long-forgotten aftermath a reunited nation where constitutional protections were suspended following the shocking assassination of President Lincoln. This fact-based story which plays up parallels to the panic that gripped post-9/11 America focuses on Mary Surratt the first woman to be executed by the United States. She was convicted by a military tribunal for her supposed role in Lincolns assassination while he was watching a play at Fords Theatre -- an episode including the confusion that followed that is vividly re-created by Redford. The evidence against Surratt (played with compelling restraint by Robin Wright) was purely circumstantial She ran a Washington boarding house where assassin John Wilkes Booth and Surratts son John met with other conspirators to plot a scheme later abandoned to abduct Lincoln. After the presidents murder Booth was quickly killed while eluding capture. Secretary of War Edwin Stanton (an excellent Kevin Kline) decides Mrs. Surratt should be tried in a military court -- rather than a civilian one -- with the other defendants in the hope it will flush her fugitive son out of hiding. Stantons kangaroo court -- which precludes Surratt from testifying and openly condones outrageous perjury by witnesses provided by the arrogant prosecutor (Danny Huston) -- offends the sensibilities of Reverdy Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) a senator from Maryland. Knowing she will have an even worse chance being defended by a Southerner he assigns his protege Frederic Aiken (James McAvoy) a decorated Union war hero to defend her before the tribunal. At first Aiken is totally convinced of Surratts guilt something that isnt helped by his clients refusal to assist in her own defense out of the fear she will implicate her son. But he begins to change his mind after enlisting the very reluctant cooperation of her daughter Anna (an impressive Evan Rachel Wood) who provides exculpatory evidence. Aiken faces a formidable opponent in Stanton who has imposed martial law on the capital city and strongly feels the harshest possible verdict -- achieved by any means necessary -- is required to prevent the country from slipping back into war. If Mary Surratt is indeed innocent shes acceptable collateral damage as far as Stanton is concerned. The casting of the very contemporary Justin Long and Alexis Bledel as Aikens best friend and fiancee -- who grow increasingly disenchanted with Aikens ardent defense of his client -- are something of a distraction. Redford also sometimes lets the pace lag over the course of two hours particularly in the talky courtroom scenes. But director always pulls you back into this well-acted still timely story. Working on an obviously limited budget on locations in Savannah Ga. Redford does a good job of evoking the era with the help of cinematographer Newton Thomas Siegel. Screenwriter James Solomon alternates scenes from the stacked tribunal with the drama unfolding in the outside world including the hunt for John Suratt (who was finally captured in Egypt after his mothers execution and let go after a civilian jury failed to reach a verdict). ""The Conspirator"" doesnt hit you over the head with its liberal political message. Its not hard to see the resemblance between Stanton who thought it his patriotic duty to take command during the weak presidency of Andrew Johnson and Dick Cheney. But hes not presented as an all-out villain either. Redfords history lesson illustrates the old maxim that those who forget history are bound to repeat it. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Charlie Sheen slammed for false claim about returning to...

Claudette Barius SMPSP Robin Wright and James McAvoy star in ""The Conspirator."" (AP Photo/Roadside Attractions Claudette Barius) The world is rarely changed by disgruntled loners. Diligent historians discover that passionate believers recruit comrades to do their dirty work.There is no question that the murder of Abraham Lincoln was a conspiracy but contemporary Americans know little about the particulars. The makers of the sturdy drama ""The Conspirator"" do a public service by illuminating a dark corner of American history yet they would rather pontificate than educate or engage.In a hurried prelude thats the liveliest section of the film we see assassins fan out across Washington while the city is celebrating the end of the Civil War. Actor and Southern sympathizer John Wilkes Booth is the only one of the conspirators to kill his target -- President Lincoln in the balcony of Fords Theater. Yet we learn little about Booth. This is a movie about Mary Surratt (Robin Wright) who ran a boarding house in Washington where many of the assassins plans were hatched and how her trial was a test of the Constitution. Surratt was arrested within days of the assassination and tried alongside several of the unrepentant plotters.Although Surratt was a civilian it was a military trial at the insistence of Secretary of War Edwin Stanton (Kevin Kline). Surratts defense is handed to Frederick Aiken (James McAvoy) a young Union Army veteran with a legal background. Although Aiken insists that every American citizen is entitled to a jury trial he seems to be convinced of his clients guilt. So while the trial we watch is undoubtedly true to the transcripts the result is that the movie is mummified. The stonewalling client remains a mystery. Instead of a dramatic showdown with a moral center the trial is a platform for a debate about due process with obvious parallels to the Guantanamo tribunals. Instead of entertaining us director Robert Redford offers us a handsome history lesson thats as dry as a hardtack biscuit.""The Conspirator""Two stars (out of four)  Rating PG-13  Run time 203  Content Some violence Videos Watch a trailer for The Conspirator Apr 14 2011 (...)

Seldom has a film been so endearingly besotted by the possibilities of flying--its about birds--dancing the samba or hell-for-feather chasing around the skies boulevards back alleys and favelas of Rio de Janeiro. (While the director Carlos Saldanha is Brazilian some of the scruffier citizens of this Rio have Mexican accents.) For a change the 3-D process is indispensable it heightens as well as deepens the kinetic experience. So is the color palette whose ceruleans yellows and crimsons do for the eyes what Tabasco sauce does for the tongue. The production eventually succumbs to motion overload--so many characters darting off in so many directions that the ending turns unfocused even flat. But watching them go by is great fun and there are worse things than a movie that cant stop moving. Watch a clip from the film ""Rio"" courtesy 20TH Century Fox. The birds at the center of the action are a pair of blue macaws voiced by Jesse Eisenberg and Anne Hathaway; both performances make the most of witty material. Blus hue is deeper than Jewels but hes still a pale excuse for a confident male and their first encounter is far from love at first flight since Blu doesnt know how to fly. Hes been so thoroughly domesticated by his loving owner Linda (Leslie Mann) that he studies aerodynamics in his cage yet continues to walk around their cozy home in Minnesota until a Brazilian ornithologist named Tulio comes out of nowhere and proposes mating him with the street-smart high-flying Jewel in Rio to save the macaw species. (The script puts wit far ahead of logic although Mr. Saldanha and his co-writer Don Rhymer had the bright comedic idea of shackling Blu and Jewel together like Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier in ""The Defiant Ones"" after theyre captured by rare-bird smugglers.) ENLARGE Pedro the cardinal center Rafael the toucan and Nico the canary with macaws Blu left and Jewel in Rio. Courtesy of Blue Sky Studios With memories of ""Saludos Amigos"" ""Black Orpheus"" and Carmen Miranda swirling in my brain I wondered if someone would show up wearing a tropical-fruit headdress and sure enough someone did--a bulldog Luiz whose slobber dangles from his mouth like misplaced pendant earrings. ""Rio"" is densely populated by antic creatures among them a swarm of thieving marmosets a toucan named Rafael and a villainous Aussie cockatoo Nigel who is voiced by Jemaine Clement of ""Flight of the Conchords"" and who serves as a sort of bulldog to a smuggler with the black heart of a Bill Sykes. Nigel has a sensational number in which he reveals himself to be an ex-soap opera star who is still embittered by having lost a role to a prettier bird. His song also comes out of nowhere and sets up expectations for more of the same. But no its a one-off flourish in a movie that cant be concerned with consistency. Watching ""Rio"" means living happily in the moment. Atlas Shrugged Part I I wanted to give this movie a fair shake though I cant pretend to be an admirer of Ayn Rands writing. But the movie the first installment of a projected trilogy doesnt give the book a fair shake. In terms of craftsmanship its barely professional except for Taylor Schillings tightly focused performance as Dagny Taggart the heroine trying to keep her railroad company from being destroyed by a government thats hostile to individual achievement. The book was published in 1957 yet the clumsiness of this production makes it seem antediluvian even though the story has been shifted to a near future when gasoline is 37.50 a gallon the capitalist system is in ruins and gifted people who might save it are mysteriously vanishing leaving only the mediocrities Rand detested. If ever there was an effective way to bring this sprawling didactic material to the screen--King Vidors 1949 version of ""The Fountainhead"" was enjoyable for its extravagant style--the director Paul Johansson and the writers John Aglialoro and Brian Patrick OToole havent found it. Dont hold your breath for parts 2 and 3. The Conspirator Mary Surratt the first woman executed by the U.S. government was convicted of conspiracy in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. In this courtroom drama adapted by James D. Solomon from the trial transcripts shes played by Robin Wright with a look of glazed rectitude that was once the exclusive province of Anne Revere. It isnt her fault though. Like most other members of an excellent cast that includes James McAvoy Kevin Kline and Tom Wilkinson she has come under the deadening directorial hand of Robert Redford. ""The Conspirator"" suggests that Mary was punished for crimes committed by her son. It also suggests a parallel between Marys plight--she was tried in a military tribunal rather than a civil court--and the plight of the Guantanamo prisoners. What it most suggests though is the sort of classroom film that has kept generations of students off the edge of their seats.

"The Conspirator Movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review The ConspiratorThe Robert Redford-directed film looks at the conspiracy trial in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. The subject resonates in our post-Sept. 11 era.April 15 2011|By Kenneth Turan Times Film Critic James McAvoy and Tom Wilkinson star in ""The Conspirator"" a... (Claudette Barius / Roadside...)""The Conspirator"" has several allies in its earnest but effective quest to make a forgotten corner of Americas past come alive. Many of those were planned including the sine qua non casting of Robin Wright in the title role but perhaps the most potent was an unintentional accident of history itself. The subject of this serious and seriously old-fashioned Robert Redford-directed film is an often overlooked aspect of an event every schoolchild knows about the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln less than a week after Robert E. Lee surrendered to Ulysses S. Grant to end the Civil War. But there was more going on during the night of April 14 1865 than John Wilkes Booths attack at Fords Theater. An attempt was made on the life of Secretary of State William H. Seward and one was planned for Vice President Andrew Johnson as well. Eight people were arrested with conspiring in this broad plot and the trial of the only woman in the group Mary Surratt an event with unexpected relevance to today is at the heart of whats on-screen. Given that this film is the first from a new entity the American Film Co. specifically founded to produce ""historically accurate"" features it is no surprise that exceptional care has been taken by production designer Kalina Ivanov costume designer Louise Frogley and their crews to get both the general look of the period and the specific details of the actual events as close to real as possible. Even though the film ended up being expertly shot in Savannah Ga. by cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel you would swear you were in the Washington D.C. of the period. Just as planned and just as successful was the casting of the powerful Wright as Surratt the mother of one of the conspirators and the operator of the Washington D.C. boarding house where many of their meetings took place. She denied knowledge of the assassination but the sense that she was the woman who ""built the nest that hatched this plot"" was not in her favor. In fact even her own inexperienced attorney Frederick Aiken (a capable James McAvoy) is disposed to disbelieve her. Recently discharged as a captain in the Union Army Aiken doesnt even want to take the case on but is persuaded to do so by his boss Reverdy Johnson (Tom Wilkinson with a Southern accent) who felt that someone with impeccable patriotic credentials was needed for the job. Worried that handling Surratts defense would be a betrayal of everything he fought for Aiken is partly persuaded to overcome his doubts by the fortitude and dignity of an imprisoned woman who frankly tells him ""I am a Southerner a Catholic a devoted mother but no assassin."" In a similar fashion the resolution and strength of Wrights unimpeachable performance makes the whole story seem flesh-and-blood real in a way that it would not otherwise be. What motivates Aiken as much as Surratts character however is that the patent unfairness of her trial before a military tribunal rather than a civilian court offends his sense of justice. With Surratt prohibited from testifying in her own defense and the government in essence making up the rules as it goes along Aiken pleads with the opposition to see that ""abandoning the Constitution is not the answer.... In our grief let us not betray our better judgment and take part in an Inquisition."" If these lines from James Solomons script sound like an up-to-the-minute response to issues resonating in our contemporary judicial system in the wake of Sept. 11 its instructive to note that he began working on the screenplay in 1993 well before the World Trade Center attack. In fact Solomon said in a recent interview with Cineaste magazine he was as surprised as anyone ""to see events unfold in a manner so similar to what was already in my script a an unprecedented act of terror hundreds rounded up the establishing of a military tribunal."" Behind the governments ruthless action was Lincolns friend Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton. Kevin Kline was an unexpected choice for a rigid steely individual who never doubted he was right but the actor handles the chance flawlessly. Also a pleasant surprise is Evan Rachel Wood more grounded than usual and appropriately emotional as Surratts daughter Anna. Though attempts have been made to portray attorney Aiken as a kind of surrogate son to Surratt (her conspirator son John having fled) the personal dramas of this story which include Aikens relationships to his sweetheart and his friends are the least involving most by-the-numbers part of the story. ""The Conspirator"" is first last and always a political drama and Wrights performance aside it is the play of events of history that most holds our interest. A celebrated line from Cicero quoted in the film sums things up ""In times of war the law falls silent."" It was true in Roman times in Mary Surratts and regrettably it remains so in ours as well. kenneth.turanlatimes.com The Conspirator MPAA rating PG-13 for some violent content Running time 2 hours 2 minutes Playing In general release MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESThe Conspirators little secretApril 14 2011The Sunday Conversation Kevin KlineMarch 27 2011Robert Redfords The Conspirator out for buzz in TorontoSeptember 10 2010MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesReviewEntertainmentAssassinationCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/reviews/la-et-conspirator-20110415,0,4041580.story?track=rss",200,theconspirator18,theconspirator,latimes

In this film publicity image released by Roadside Attractions Robin Wright left portrays Mary Surratt in a scene from ""The Conspirator."" Photo Claudette Barius SMPSP AP The Conspirator review Lincoln assassination 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Conspirator Drama. Starring James McAvoy Robin Wright Penn Tom Wilkinson and Kevin Kline. Directed by Robert Redford. (PG-13. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Grieving about events that occurred before we were born feels unnatural like a rejection of a world weve always known. But in ""The Conspirator"" director Robert Redford persuades us if not to grieve to understand other peoples grief and to look at the assassination of Abraham Lincoln with fresh eyes. He invites us to see it not as some immovable historical event but as people of the time saw it as an absolute outrage and an epic disaster. Politically motivated and successful in its result the assassination deprived the country of its greatest man probably stalled civil rights for three generations and was part of a larger conspiracy. Its surprising how few people know this Lincolns assassination was just one act in a plan to decapitate the government. The same night Lincoln was murdered Secretary of State William Seward was stabbed and almost killed and Vice President Andrew Johnson was the target of an abortive attempt. No wonder people were frightened - and its precisely that fear that Redford sets out to explore. ""The Conspirator"" is all about the un-American things Americans can do when feeling collectively threatened. Related Stories The Conspirator Did she do it? Specifically its the story of Mary Surratt a middle-aged Washington D.C. widow who owned the boardinghouse where the plot was hatched. Surratt - a Southern sympathizer whose son was almost certainly part of the conspiracy - was arrested and stood trial and for almost 150 years controversy has surrounded her name. Was she innocent? Was she a rabid conspirator? Or was she something in between? At the time Surratt (Robin Wright Penn) is arrested the entire North hates her guts and the national government wants her hanged as soon as possible. A Maryland senator (Tom Wilkinson) takes up her defense and is heckled and ridiculed by the military tribunal. He resigns in favor of his young colleague the Union war hero Frederick Aiken (James McAvoy) who comes into the case hostile toward his own client but gradually warms to the task of defending her. As befitting a movie counseling against unbridled passion the emotions are tepid in ""The Conspirator"" but then Redford has always been a cool customer. (Chris Kings 2009 short ""The Killing of Mary Surratt"" packed more emotion into 23 minutes than can be found in all 123 minutes of this movie.) Redford doesnt take a stand on Surratts guilt or innocence which given the evidence might actually make sense. But his agnosticism closes the door on a huge potential source of drama. To the extent the film has passion it revolves around a cerebral though crucial concept In a time of crisis we must never be frightened into curtailing constitutionally guaranteed freedoms. The analogy being made between the aftermaths of Lincolns assassination and 9/11 is pertinent and clear and yet the movie couldnt be less subtle about it had Redford used a jackhammer. Go in expecting a spirited defense of an innocent woman and you end up with a sermon on everyones right to a fair trial. Still working within self-imposed limits Redford and his screenwriters devise a compelling film. Wright is enigmatic as Mary (only Wright knows if Mary did it) and McAvoy brings his usual flustered decency very appropriate for an ambitious young man defending the least popular woman in town. Kevin Kline is a little tall and thin for the squat Secretary of War Edwin Stanton but he has the right air of single-mindedness. Respects history ""The Conspirator"" is respectful of the historical record down to the small details When the mortally wounded Lincoln is carried across the street and placed in bed he is laid diagonally (the bed was too small for him). The trial scenes are enraging - the tribunal is a collection of implacable thugs. Equally engrossing are the scenes outside the courtroom. More than any other film Ive seen about this period ""The Conspirator"" creates the sense of actually being there. Whether its something in the color palette or in the saturation of the color or in the setting of the scenes when Redford shows an exterior you can almost smell the air and believe that youre seeing 1865. Perhaps it feels real because Redford ever the skeptic doesnt romanticize it. The world he shows us is far away but not so far that we dont recognize it. -- Advisory You cant have an assassination without blood. E-mail Mick LaSalle at mlasallesfchronicle.com.

(Claudette Barius) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday April 14 2011 225 PM Title The Conspirator With Robin Wright James McAvoy. Political drama about Mary Surratts true-life trial. Director Robert Redford (203). PG-13 violence. At area theaters.Like his 2007 political drama ""Lions for Lambs"" Robert Redfords fictionalized chronicle of Mary Surratts 1865 trial is high-minded and slow-moving. Some may chafe at his unsubtle sermonizing but strong central performances will reward the patient.After Abraham Lincolns assassination the War Secretary (Kevin Kline) and his consorts in Congress are less interested in justice or civil liberties than in appeasing an anxious nation. So Surratt (Robin Wright) who ran the boarding house in which John Wilkes Booth plotted the Presidents death is denied a public trial and forced before a military tribunal.A young lawyer (James McAvoy) reluctantly agrees to defend her more out of belief in the Constitution than her actual innocence. Though he too wants to see someone pay for Lincolns death he is offended by the notionthat her fate has clearly been decided in advance.The enclosed sets and Redfords stagy direction suggest that this material would be better suited to a theater. Or one cant help thinking a lecture hall. The parallels between Then and Now are so dramatically drawn Redford and screenwriter James Solomon unwittingly weaken their own message.But Wright and McAvoy she so ominously still and he filled with fire build beautifully on the filmmakers heartfelt intentions. The characters are written as symbols; the actors give them unexpected life.

It burrows in on the case against Mary Surratt who owned the boardinghouse where assassin John Wilkes Booth and his co-conspirators plotted the presidents murder.Post-Civil War Washington was a terrifying place. Telling its story with all its bloody edges makes The Conspirator an exceptional movie in the way that Redfords 1980 Oscar-winning directorial debut Ordinary People made a gut-wrenching statement about parenting.The story is less about the assassination and more about prosecutors smashing the rule of law in seeking vengeance against the enemies of a man who may have cared more about the rule of law than any president before or since. Its not hard to imagine that Lincoln would have been horrified at the kangaroo court that gives Mary Surratt a one-in-a-million chance.Robin Wrights quiet elegance is perfectly suited to Surratt whose guilt or innocence is never fully determined though to dwell on that is to miss the point of The Conspirator altogether. The film soars in documenting the rare courage of Frederick Aiken who agreed to defend Surratt and who cared deeply for the rule of law which is all but dismembered in a military tribunals attempts to cast the widest possible net of anger and suspicion.Redford may have taken liberties with the story (for one Aikens fiancee actually may not have abandoned him as The Conspirator suggests) but that fails to detract from his larger point The director who as an actor portrayed reporter Bob Woodward in All the Presidents Men has a keen understanding of how some have subverted the rule of law and with disastrous consequences as the Pentagon Papers the Watergate scandal Iran-Contra and the outing of CIA agent Valerie Plame so chillingly show. Those who wish to uphold the rule of law are often vilified at great peril to their lives and careers.That puts a lot on the shoulders of James McAvoy who turns in a breakout performance in capturing Aikens frustration. It also shows why this gifted attorney later abandoned the law to become the first city editor of The Washington Post.Despite being a decorated Union war hero Aiken sees his battlefield laurels quickly forgotten the moment he steps up to defend Surratt something no one else would do. The tribunal seeking her conviction harbors an ulterior motive one we wont reveal here.Its one of many reasons to see The Conspirator. Hollywood should make more movies about American history given the level of knowledge about stories such as this which played a huge role in shaping our history and defining our morality as a nation.The ConspiratorA-Starring James McAvoy Robin Wright Evan Rachel Wood Kevin Kline and Tom Wilkinson.

Comments click to enlarge The Conspirator Recommended Video Rated PG-13  121 minutes  2011 Joe Ricketts whose family owns the Chicago Cubs founded the American Film Company to produce historical dramas that actually stick to the facts and the facts are more than enough in this somber engrossing drama about the Lincoln assassination. James McAvoy stars as Frederick Aiken a young attorney and former Union officer who reluctantly agrees to defend alleged conspirator Mary Surratt in a military trial and eventually concludes that shes being framed. The trumped-up case against her and the courtroom drama at the center of the movie are heavily reminiscent of Bruce Beresfords Breaker Morant (1980) but producer-director Robert Redford also notes the parallels between the Surratt case and our current military tribunals for terror suspects.

Speeches orations objections rebuttals -- so many different ways to talk argue and pontificate and theyre all on prominent display in Robert Redfords expansively chatty American history lesson ""The Conspirator."" Using the fascinating little-known events immediately following Lincolns assassination to rebuke the mob mentality that would deny any defendant a fair trial this methodical courtroom drama is charged with impassioned performances and an unimpeachable liberal message. But its stodgy emphasis on telling over showing will limit its reach to Civil War buffs and self-selecting older viewers given the mainstream aversion even to period dramas more action-oriented than this. A fledgling feature for the American Film Co. which is seeking a distributor in Toronto ""The Conspirator"" opens with a brief budget-conscious evocation of the Civil War battlefield establishing the heroic military service of young Union soldier and aspiring attorney Frederick Aiken (James McAvoy). Leaping forward two years Redford fluidly re-creates the fateful events at Fords Theater on April 14 1865 and the concurrent savage but not fatal attack on Secretary of State William Seward. Once the front-loaded action has died down the story proper begins picking methodically through the embers of the plot to defeat Lincolns administration -- a full-blown conspiracy that extended well beyond John Wilkes Booth (played here by Toby Kebbell). Eight alleged conspirators are rounded up the lone woman among them being Mary Surratt (Robin Wright) owner of the boarding house where Booth and his collaborators met regularly. Convinced of Marys complicity (though she coldly denies any involvement) Aiken is shocked when his mentor Southern attorney Reverdy Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) tasks him with defending the woman before a Washington military tribunal which -- as presided over by Gen. David Hunter (Colm Meaney) and overseen from afar by dangerously empowered Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton (Kevin Kline) -- seems unlikely to guarantee Mary a constitutional fair hearing. Even Aiken isnt certain she deserves one until he begins to investigate the recent disappearance of Marys son John (Johnny Simmons) a Booth associate for whom she seems to be taking the fall. Exhaustively researched from historical accounts trial transcripts and personal diaries James Solomons imposingly articulate screenplay (based on a story by Solomon and Gregory Bernstein) sketches a portrait of a fragile America torn between two polarized sides and in danger of sacrificing justice on the altar of revenge. If that sounds familiar its meant to; while no direct reference is made to say the U.S. mistreatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay the wide-ranging topical implications of the pictures overweeningly didactic approach are unmistakable. Directed by Redford with his usual patient deliberation ""The Conspirator"" offers receptive viewers the traditional pleasures of classical narrative construction and reams of eloquent talk. Yet while the courtroom proceedings compel attention initially -- as Aikens case is frustrated at every turn by Hunter and the prosecutor Judge Advocate Gen. Joseph Holt (Danny Huston) -- a certain weariness sets in due to the lack of modulation in the discourse the obviousness of the storytelling and the absence of any real subtext apart from the hard-to-miss contempo parallels. If the film feels as though it would have been nearly as effective and less expensive as a radio play (its essentially ""12 Angry Men"" with kerosene lamps) it does offer the memorable image of Wrights pallid tightly drawn mask of a face; thesp is superb here icily withholding at first but growing incrementally in tragic stature. One of a handful of actors from across the Pond (including Meaney and Wilkinson) in the enormous ensemble McAvoy effectively shoulders the heavy dramatic burden with the necessary conviction and lung power. Other thesps are mostly fine in one-note parts though Evan Rachel Wood is a standout as Marys daughter who reluctantly assists Aiken in his search for the truth. Pic was shot entirely in Savannah Ga. whose substantially intact 19th-century architecture provides a suitable backdrop for the production. Newton Thomas Sigels cinematography has an evocative burnished quality but is at times dominated by too many blinding shafts of sunlight lending the film a slight waxworks quality that keeps it from feeling entirely inhabited.

TWITTER Once the dry dust of history gets whisked away ""The Conspirator"" feels like a television movie. TORONTO -- The American Film Co. which seeks to make movies drawn from American history hits a jackpot of sorts with its first film. The producers came up with a real who-knew? -- one of those stories that freshman history never uncovered -- and they landed Robert Redford to direct a starry cast. Even so once the dry dust of history gets whisked away The Conspirator feels like a television movie. Perhaps because a large part of the story -- centering on the conspiracy to assassinate Abraham Lincoln -- takes place in a courtroom theres lots of talk and not much action. So the film seeking a distributor here is very much a tough sell. Its an admirable film mixing history few people know with several real-life personalities well worth knowing. Unfortunately viewers for such fare are older and less prone to line up on a first weekend. A distributor will need to roll this film out incrementally looking for feature stories reviews and word-of-mouth to entice history buffs and the curious into adult venues. Redford does a good job in developing the drama and making one of the least sympathetic women in American history into something of a heroine. But the film largely rests on a character played with considerable emotional energy by James McAvoy Union veteran and war hero Frederick Aiken who as a new lawyer defended Mary Surratt one of four individuals charged in the conspiracy after John Wilkes Booth was shot trying to escape arrest. Screenwriter James Solomon dug into court transcripts and deeper still into this chapter in American history to expose another kind of conspiracy The portrait he paints is of panicky Secretary of War Edwin Stanton (an authoritarian Kevin Kline) who practically runs the government in the weeks following Lincolns assassination. Stanton wants a quick trial and execution of the four conspirators to get the whole thing over with and literally buried all in the name of the nations good. The problem is that the government is missing its fourth conspirator John Surratt (Johnny Simmons) who escapes a massive manhunt. (The film alleges elements within the Catholic Church hid him.) So instead it puts his mother Mary (Robin Wright) on trial figuring this will flush him out. It doesnt. So her defense counsel Sen. Reverdy Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) insists that his new associate Frederick defend her seeing that her only chance lies in being repped by a Union vet. But she is being tried in a military tribunal with generals handpicked to ensure a desired guilty verdict. The movie boils down to the gradual transformation of Fredericks character from one who scoffs at his clients innocence to one who sees that whatever her innocence or guilt he fought for a nation of laws and justice and this kangaroo court makes a mockery of both. Other characters that come into play include Marys daughter Anna (Evan Rachel Wood) Fredericks increasingly distraught fiancee Sarah (Alexis Bledel) insidious prosecutor Joseph Holt (Danny Huston born for the role) and two highly dubious prosecution witnesses (Jonathan Groff and Stephen Root). Like ""A Man for All Seasons"" or any movie about personal conscience Conspirator concerns itself less with the historical conflict than the one inside its heros heart. He shares his (legal) opponents contempt for the rebels and conspirators but is Mary Surratt -- whose guilt rests on the flimsy fact that the conspirators met at her Washington boardinghouse -- truly one of them? The film never quite figures that out but strongly suggests this mother would go to any length to protect her son. Meanwhile Frederick sees political expediency at the cost of injustice as being a foolhardy way to bind the Union back together. McAvoy brilliantly plays a man trapped in the web of his own conscience. He looks to escape but every avenue closes abruptly. He will have to learn to live with himself then because everyone else in his life drifts away. Wright plays an enigma but her acting is anything but. Her Mary is convinced of the rightness in her non-cooperation in her own defense and sustains herself through faith and convictions. Production values are sharp with an arresting design that brings the District of Columbia circa 1865 to brilliant life with filming in Savannah Ga. where much of the eras federal architecture survives. Newton Thomas Sigels moody and drained cinematography and Kalina Ivanovs fastidiously researched production design go hand in glove with Louise Frogleys meticulous period costumes. Some moviegoers will be shocked to see that D.C. was more of a rural muddy town than a national capital in those days. Conspirator is never less than thought-provoking and illuminating. Its an answer to those who moan that they dont make movies like they used to. But will those reluctant viewers embrace this new kind of old-fashioned history drama?

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet As the head of the Sundance Institute and the godfather of the Sundance Film Festival Robert Redford has helped provide a practical education for countless filmmakers but that doesnt mean he needs to keep treating filmgoers like fidgety schoolchildren. First he punished audiences with the coma-inducing current-affairs lecture Lions For Lambs. Now he brings the dishwater-grey seriousness of the classroom to the big screen with The Conspirator a lifeless new drama about the only woman indicted for the Lincoln assassination. Lets just be grateful that boring old Professor Redford only afflicts audiences with his good intentions and social consciousness about twice a decade. James McAvoy stars as a promising young attorney burdened with the impossible feat of defending a woman (Robin Wright-Penn) accused of being one of the conspirators behind the plot that killed Abraham Lincoln and wounded Secretary Of State William H. Seward. McAvoys background as a Union war hero makes him a politically savvy pick for the job but hes nevertheless ostracized and persecuted for representing such a reviled figure and his proud defiant client isnt about to make his task any easier than it has to be. Redford chronicled the travails of a different kind of public pariah in Quiz Show but his workmanlike historical drama fatally lacks a figure as compellingly tormented as Ralph Fiennes fraudulent academic or as intriguingly abrasive as John Turturros chatterbox know-it-all. Instead were left with the likeable but bland McAvoy and the shrill unknowable Wright-Penn. The Conspirator wants to unleash a sense of righteous outrage over a historical wrong but its far too sleepy and polite in a PBS pledge-fund-appeal sort of way to incite mild interest let alone passion. The Conspirator should skip theaters altogether and become the first film released straight to middle-school history classes where the standards for what can generously be deemed entertainment are much lower.

In a rush to injustice she was the scapegoat sacrificed to feed those hungry to avenge Lincolns death. Her son John was a known associate of Booth. And it would appear that she was tried because her son was nowhere to be found.Surratts story brought to life in a stoic and sympathetic performance by Robin Wright is a little-known chapter of American history recovered by screenwriter James D. Solomon and director Robert Redford in The Conspirator.This provocative account of a war-weary administration that denied Surratt her right to a fair trial starts slow but builds momentum in the scenes with Wright and Evan Rachel Wood as Surratts flinty daughter Anna.""In times of war the law falls silent"" goes Ciceros maxim quoted in the film by Surratts prosecutor Joseph Holt (Danny Huston). Her reluctant lawyer is Frederick Aiken (James McAvoy). Hes a Union war hero assigned to defend the Confederate sympathizer who refers to the late commander in chief as ""your president."" Though she is a civilian she is tried by military tribunal.Initially Aiken is embarrassed by his assignment. Friends think hes defending the enemy and shun him. But Aikens belief in Surratts constitutional right to a fair trial - and increasingly in her innocence - makes this a potent drama about a time not unlike the politically polarized present when prisoners at Guantanamo await trial for 9/11 conspiracy.Shot mostly in enclosed spaces jail cells and courtrooms Redfords film lacks oxygen but compensates for this deficit in Newton Thomas Sigels atmospheric cinematography which has the celestial light sepia tones and compositions of 19th-century photographs.While this has the effect of making the film seem more pictorial than cinematic it also focuses the mind on the miscarriage of justice. Redford always gets the best out of actors and his cast - especially Wright Wood Huston and Tom Wilkinson - is exceptional.Redfords directorial hand is most evident in a sequence in which Anna Surratt is brought to the witness stand and the court orders soldiers to crowd around Mary Surratt so she cannot clap eyes on her daughter.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + ""The Conspirator is an important film on an important subject that has had the life beaten out of it by Robert Redford a man who should know better. How is it possible that the moving force behind the Sundance Film Festival an event ostensibly dedicated to keeping the cinema young has made such a stodgy ham-handed waxwork?Because Redford and his screenwriters James Solomon and Gregory Bernstein have something to say thats why and subtlety be damned. In 1865 the US Department of War under secretary Edwin Stanton put the accused assassins of President Lincoln before a military tribunal -- a kangaroo court when all was said and done -- rather than giving them a civil trial. Among them was Mary Surratt a Confederate sympathizer who ran the Washington D.C. boarding house where the conspirators gathered and whose son John Surratt was among their number.The mother maintained she knew nothing of the assassination plot and history has never fully resolved the matter. Did she or didnt she? ""The Conspirator isnt terribly interested. The films concern and the true subject of its anger is the trampling received by the US Constitution the Bill of Rights and our individual liberties -- a trampling we in the audience are more than welcome to connect to our present era of Guantanamo Bay and extraordinary rendition. In truth all you need to do the math is a shot of the accused assassins in military court with hoods over their heads -- an image that is historically accurate relevant and shaming to both eras.So theres a good ugly civics lesson here -- one that becomes a tedious Afterschool Special in Redfords hands. Obviously this director is going to attract a stellar cast Robin Wright as Mary Surratt; James McAvoy as Frederick Aiken the young attorney (and Union veteran) who defends her with initial reluctance and then a righteous fervor that costs him his social standing; Evan Rachel Wood as Marys daughter Anna; Kevin Kline effectively loathsome as Stanton; Danny Huston as the oily prosecutor.Every single one of them comes to grief trapped by dialogue that alternates between dull cliche and boilerplate speechifying. The better actors hit their allotted character notes (moral outrage for McAvoy noble martyrdom for Wright beady-eyed expediency for Kline) and move on while others flounder helplessly. There is no earthly reason for Justin Long to be in a Civil War movie but here he is in all his postmodern hangdog doofishness.More shocking for a director of Redfords stature is just how poorly this movie has been made. The cinematography by Newton Thomas Sigel smears a gauzy brown wash over everything until you feel like youre watching through a layer of pond water. Mark Ishams intrusive score and Craig McKays editing frog-march the audience dutifully from one scene to the next. These are all established craftsmen with respected work under their belts so why does the film play like an animatronic display rather than an actual movie?Thats easy The importance of its message has trumped the simple art of storytelling. Redfords best most insightful films ""Ordinary People and ""A River Runs Through It have been about intrafamily conflicts but he cant translate that urgency to a narrative about the American family. Instead as with 2007s ""Lions for Lambs he climbs on a soapbox. This isnt moviemaking but badgering and it does a disservice to everyone involved. Whether she was guilty or innocent what happened to Mary Surratt -- up to and including some last-minute obstruction of justice by the White House itself -- was a national disgrace and were better off knowing about it. Redfords film commits the much lesser crime of rendering history two-dimensional.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. To follow him go to www.twitter.com/tyburr.

The film delving onto a little-known angle of the Lincoln assassination is solid enough. Almost every role is acted more than capably. It asks worthy questions about military tribunals judging civilians and a society that ballyhoos its freedoms but grows forgetful when theyre inconvenient. Too bad it feels more like a homework assignment than entertainment. You watch it impatiently waiting for the recess bell to ring. The film is set mostly after John Wilkes Booths fatal shot in Fords Theatre as the nation demands swift justice. James McAvoy plays Union Army veteran Frederick Aiken assigned to defend Mary Surratt (Robin Wright) a Southern sympathizer owner of a D.C. boardinghouse and mother of suspected conspirator John Surratt. With Booth and Surratt fugitive Mary was the easiest person to apprehend. Aiken still scarred by horrific memories of combat goes through the standard reluctant-hero conversion mounting a passionate defense as his doubts about her guilt and qualms about the military trial both grow. The usual judicial rigmarole of unreliable witnesses objections and rulings from the bench are complicated by military jurisprudence designed to deliver a streamlined version of justice for combatants. The usual rules of civilian courts dont apply and a sense of kangaroo court jurisprudence reigns. McAvoy gives a sturdy performance as the conflicted lawyer. Hes comfortable with archaic courtroom dialogue both technical and flowery. He issues little smoke signals of misgiving that erupt into fiery outrage as the mock trial progresses. Colm Meaney the infuriating officer in charge of the trial is in every way his opposite number clipped of speech and chilly of demeanor. Their verbal duels are engaging a too brief respite from stagey scenes and declamatory speeches. Wright is a one-note paragon of aggrieved dignity Kevin Kline virtually hisses his lines as vengeful Secretary of War Edwin Stanton and the period interiors have the airless ambience of museum displays. ""The Conspirator"" is a worthy historical reenactment but not much of a movie. Eight score and seven minutes feels ever so long. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

"Historical investigation takes a wrong turn - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Historical investigation takes a wrong turnThe Conspirator a 2 starsApril 14 2011|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticRobin Wright and James McAvoy in the thriller ""The Conspirator.""Heartbreakingly average director Robert Redfords ""The Conspirator"" errs in the way so many films do especially films about unsung pieces of American history. It focuses on the wrong character -- in this case the white male i.e. the ""bankable"" one instead of the person the storys really about. On April 17 1865 three days after John Wilkes Booth assassinated Abraham Lincoln Washington D.C. boarding house owner Mary Surratt along with seven others was arrested on charges of conspiracy to kill the president. Was this Confederate sympathizer an active participant in Booths deadly plot or merely an acquaintance? What was her scheming sons precise role in the events that threatened to bring down the nation? The movies screenwriter James Solomon keeps Surratt herself at a remove from the main line of the action in what is at heart a courtroom drama. Surratts court defender in the military tribunal Unionist Frederick Aiken may have believed in Surratts innocence. Or he may have thought she was guilty. The conflicted Aiken becomes the so-called audience identification figure. This is frustrating not because Aiken is inherently dull but because Surratts circumstances and psychological nooks and crannies are inarguably more dramatic. With James McAvoy in the leading role ""The Conspirator"" has an actor of considerable skill but uneven judgment. His Aiken comes off as a petulant fellow anachronistically blase (though McAvoy in his beard resembles a young Ulysses S. Grant). The story is told as one righteous man up against a stacked deck full of stony steely faces determined to give a bloodthirsty post-Civil War public a scapegoat. Redfords ensemble is blessed with many fine character actors chief among them Tom Wilkinson (as Aikens mentor former Attorney General Reverdy Johnson) Colm Meaney (Gen. David Hunter) and Kevin Kline (war secretary Edwin Stanton). They provide the interpretive juice missing from Solomons stilted dialogue. Redfords peak achievement as a director ""Quiz Show"" had the benefit of a sharp fast verbally adroit screenplay. Were in a more somber stylistic realm here but Redford struggles to locate a tone and a rhythm and reasons to justify so much emphasis on Aiken. As Surratt Robin Wright lends a cryptic dignity to a mysterious historical figure. There is however a difference between a shadowy historical figure and a shadowy historical figure brought to life. Unlike ""The Assassins Accomplice"" the book that inspired ""The Conspirator"" the movies so intent on treating Surratt with dignity and restraint it fails to make her interesting. mjphillipstribune.com phillipstribune MPAA rating PG-13 (for some violent content) Cast James McAvoy (Frederick Aiken); Robin Wright (Mary Surratt); Kevin Kline (Edwin M.

The Conspirator Good Director Robert Redford. Cast James McAvoy Robin Wright Tom Wilkinson Kevin Kline. Rating PG-13 for violent content. Guide to this weeks new releases These are as it happens among its strengths. Robert Redfords depiction of the trial of Mary Surratt is at heart sort of a history lesson a really interesting one. And with Redfords confident direction of a cast that includes James McAvoy Robin Wright Tom Wilkinson and Kevin Kline its one thats well told. Oh and its a metaphor for post-9/11 erosion of civil rights. Frederick Aiken (McAvoy) is a Civil War hero ready to get back to a career in law when Abraham Lincoln is assassinated. Redford does a good job of imparting the almost mind-bending shock to the nation. Secretary of War Edwin Stanton (Kline) becomes the de facto leader of the country in the immediate aftermath (among his orders keep Vice President Johnson away from the liquor). The actor John Wilkes Booth (Toby Kebbell) is quickly identified as the gunman but its clear he didnt act alone. An extensive manhunt leads to Booths death and the capture of seven men - and one woman - in the conspiracy to kill Lincoln as well as the vice president and secretary of State. The woman Mary Surratt (Wright) owns the boardinghouse where Booth met with other conspirators including her son John (Johnny Simmons) whose whereabouts are unknown. Was Surratt aware of what was going on under her roof? The government says yes no matter what the evidence. As Stanton proclaims a swift verdict and punishment for all those accused will help heal the nation. Thus Aiken is surprised when he is summoned by Sen. Reverdy Johnson (Wilkinson) and learns that he is to prepare the defense for Mary Surratt. He is appalled as are his friends and colleagues. Yet Johnson explains does Surratt not enjoy a constitutional right to presumed innocence even for such a horrific crime? The military tribunal hearing the case is led by David Hunter (Colm Meaney) who makes it clear by the prejudicial way in which he conducts the trial that justice is not blind in this instance; the prosecutor Joseph Holt (Danny Huston) takes full advantage of the leeway hes given. As the trial progresses Aiken becomes more and more disillusioned. He is appalled at the governments conduct in prosecuting its case. Witnesses are gotten to. Testimony changes. Anna Surratt (Evan Rachel Wood) Marys daughter is called to testify but soldiers stand between her and her mother so that they cant see each other. Aikens objections are routinely overruled. Whats effective in Redfords telling of the story is that even as Aiken becomes more frustrated he still is not convinced of Surratts innocence. Neither are we. But he is convinced that anything approaching a fair trial is impossible. Wright is excellent in her portrayal of a woman whose motives and actions are complex. Yes she hated the North and Lincoln she admits as did her family. But she didnt plot to kill him. The parallels to post-9/11 America are obvious. Does the safety of the nation outweigh an individuals rights? Its easy to read Stanton as a stand-in for the Bush administration after the attacks. If anything Kline may overplay the part a bit. While hes perfectly willing to trample Surratts rights hes also terrified that the recently won peace wont hold if she and the others are not punished and quickly. But Aiken argues thats not justice. Thats revenge. The cast is uniformly outstanding a pleasure to watch. Its a more toned-down role for the often-fiery McAvoy and it suits him. The pace takes some getting used to - it will doubtless be too slow for some. But if you immerse yourself in it ""The Conspirator"" is a satisfying telling of an important chapter of the nations history one whose consequences echo still.

The Conspirator (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies The Conspirator (PG-13) Fascinating history lesson made dry. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com4/13/2011 Editor rating 1 The assassination of Abraham Lincoln isnt exactly an obscure chapter in U.S. history and even if youve never heard of Mary Surratt -- the boarding-house owner accused of helping John Wilkes Booth and his posse plot the attack on the president -- the fact that a movie has been made about her trial is a pretty strong indication of how the story is going to end. Robert Redford who directed The Conspirator has a hit-and-miss record as a filmmaker He made his debut with the wonderful Ordinary People (loathed by many film buffs for stealing the Best Picture Oscar from Raging Bull) and his 1950s drama Quiz Show remains one of the most underrated films of the 1990s. But Redfords recent output as a director -- the ridiculousr The Horse Whisperer the Ambien equivalent of The Legend of Bagger Vance and the exasperatingly didactic Lions for Lambs-- has been the work of an aging artist who has lost his touch for dynamic engrossing storytelling. The Conspirator hits a new nadir for Redford Sitting through this stage-bound talky stiffly-acted movie reminded me of having to endure the Hall of Presidents attraction at Walt Disney World (one of the few existing bits of proof that Disney had a dark and evil side). Instead of exploring how the countrys outpouring of grief and anger over Lincolns murder led to civil-rights violations and legal steamrolling in a country still healing from a ferocious and costly war The Conspirator lectures about how the Constitution must be upheld at all costs regardless of extenuating circumstance or appearance of guilt. Redford is obviously drawing modern-day equivalents to Guantanamo and rendition tactics but by trying so hard to give the story a contemporary subtext he ends up glossing over the period details that would have made The Conspirator much more interesting. Robin Wright Penn plays Mary as a martyr willing to die before giving up the location of her fugitive son (who may also have participated in Lincolns death). She clutches rosary beads prays and gives the bullying judges pious looks. James McAvoy is Frederick Aiken a Civil War hero and young lawyer assigned to defend Mary whom he initially believe is guilty but gradually changes his mind. By insisting on providing the accused with a proper defense Frederick suffers public humiliations such as having his country-club membership revoked. The horror Faring worst is Kevin Kline as the dour Secretary of War Edwin Stanton whose zero tolerance toward anyone with even the slightest air of suspicion would have made him a prime candidate for the Bush administration. The story of The Conspirator was worth telling but a much lighter hand and a lot less moustache-twirling would have served the material better.

By Anthony Lane Robin Wright and James McAvoy in Robert Redfords Lincoln-assassination movie.   Credit Illustration by ANDY FRIEDMAN Of the many questions posed by ""The Conspirator"" and left unresolved the most pressing are these How much did Mary Surratt (Robin Wright) know of the plot to kill Abraham Lincoln? How could she not have known of it given that some of it was hatched within the respectable boarding house that she ran in Washington D.C.? If her son John (Johnny Simmons) who certainly did know of the plot had surrendered to the authorities rather than remaining on the run could he have saved his mothers skin? Why did Andrew Johnson the new President reject the last-minute late-night application by Surratts lawyer for a retrial? And was there ever any likelihood considering the public revulsion at the murder that she would receive a fair trial in the first place? It is almost a century since D. W. Griffith in the course of ""The Birth of a Nation"" (1915) dramatized the same assassination which in turn had taken place only fifty years before. In ""The Conspirator"" John Wilkes Booth is played by someone who looks like Borat but Griffiths Booth was played by Raoul Walsh who went on to become a major director making movies up to the nineteen-sixties. Such are the seven-league leaps with which cinema connects us to the past. The director of ""The Conspirator"" Robert Redford and his screenwriter James D. Solomon spend less than half an hour on the night of the killing itself but they use the time briskly; whether or not by design they follow Griffiths original procedure right down to the closeup of Booths pistol outside the theatre box and his daring jump to the stage once the deed is done. The remainder of the new film is centered in the courtroom where Surratt and some of her fellow-defendants were tried and where she was represented by Frederick Aiken (James McAvoy) a young attorney on his first case. Occasionally we glance beyond to the office of Reverdy Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) the Maryland senator and former Attorney General who takes on Marys defense and hands it to Aiken; to the plush environs of the Century Club which Aiken repairs to in the evening and from which he is blackballed for the zeal of his defense; and into the unflinching gaze of Edwin Stanton (Kevin Kline) the Secretary of War who sees the case through to its harshest possible conclusion. To the news that those who are deciding Surratts fate have made up their minds in favor of clemency Stantons response is one of iron. ""Then let us change them"" he says. If the film presents him as a de-facto President doing the dirty work for his weaker boss (""Keep him away from the liquor"" he says of Johnson on the night of the murder) that is no accident. Kline brings his customary nimbleness of mind to the role but it amuses him slightly too much and thus frightens us too little and he only won the part I imagine because Redford couldnt get Donald Rumsfeld. Redfords previous work was ""Lions for Lambs"" (2007) which was so busy explicating the arguments for and against Americas involvement in foreign conflicts that it pretty much forgot to be a movie at all. Likewise in ""The Conspirator"" one wishes that the director had found the grace to touch upon rather than belabor the parallels between the conspirators of 1865 and the present-day inmates of Guantanamo the humiliating hoods that they are forced to wear and the adjudicating presence of a military tribunal instead of a civilian jury. Now and then the dourness takes a break and I am always a sucker for a good old-fashioned showdown in a courtroom especially when the wily prosecutor is played by Danny Huston who seems twice as mean when hes trying to be nice. Villains aside you have to reach back to ""Quiz Show"" in 1994 to find a Redford picture that fulfilled its brief to entertain and from the opening moments of the new movie--""presented by the American Film Company"" with its logo of a flapping Stars and Stripes--the air is thick with noble intentions. Close your eyes listen to the music that accompanies the gravely wounded President from the theatre to the house opposite and you would swear that you were attending not a movie screening but an act of worship. Is it just because we are in the vicinity of Lincoln that ""The Conspirator"" acquires its visionary glaze? There is one superb detail glimpsed in passing that shows hucksters selling Lincoln memorabilia outside the jail where Surratt is being held but that flash of the mercenary (and the modern) is never repeated. Most of mid-nineteenth-century Washington looks impossibly neat and clean unroughened by any sense of war-weariness. It is less in the decor however than in the wielding of light that Redford aided by his director of photography Newton Thomas Sigel strives to convince us that the past was not so much a definable place--complete with dirt and sweat and closely related to our own age--as a distant glowing planet to be approached with awe. I was hoping that Redford had exhausted his love of soft gilding in ""A River Runs Through It"" (1992) better known as ""The Vaseline Rubs on It"" but the new film bathes in the stuff. Surratts prison cell sparkles with motes of decorous dust; tobacco smoke wreathes the courtroom in a silver mist; and as James McAvoy strolls down a street after dark the lamplight reflects so blazingly off the cobbles that you can see right through his shins. All of this not surprisingly affects the performances. Its hard not to like McAvoy with his glancing nervous energy but ""The Conspirator"" rarely permits him to be anything except likable and the script smooths out any wrinkles in the figure of Aiken. I have read a transcript of his actual closing statement and it consists largely of what a lawyer friend of mine calls Hiawaffle gassy with Victorian sententiousness (""the aegis of impregnable legal justice which circumvallates and sanctifies the threshold of home"") and nothing like the terse abbreviated version we get here. In truth Aiken wasnt much of a lawyer and he doesnt make much of a hero. We first see him on the battlefield--wounded in the Union cause and (of course) issuing an order that another man be treated first. Aiken did indeed fight bravely although you would never guess from the film that before enlisting he wrote a letter offering his services to the Confederates. The movie concludes by informing us that after leaving the law he became the first city editor of the Washington Post--by a happy coincidence the newspaper on which Redford himself enjoyed his dramatic apotheosis as Bob Woodward in ""All the Presidents Men."" How McAvoy would have loved to get his teeth into the more interesting less unsullied Aiken whom we find in the historical record the one who according to the Philadelphia Inquirer was ""bound over to Court"" only a year after the Surratt case for forging signatures on checks. Still despite these disappointments credit is due to ""The Conspirator."" It may never supply the more troublesome hard-bitten version of events that is there for the asking but it does trace a minor absorbing tributary of the vast Lincoln story hitherto explored by specialists alone; whether Mary Surratt for instance will rate a mention let alone a sequence in Steven Spielbergs forthcoming Lincoln movie remains to be seen. Robin Wright is drawn and dignified in the martyrish role and you believe in her heart-torn response as Aiken attempts to rescue her late in the day by incriminating her son. What mother would agree to that? But she is given perilously little to work with and Redford seems consumed less by who she was than by what she stands for. If you seek a person not a symbol grounded in her period costume and demeanor try Evan Rachel Wood who plays Surratts daughter Anna. She has the uncanny look of an old photograph with her dreamy-stony gaze as she sits in a brown dress on a settee almost fading into the wall. Both actresses reserve their strongest work for the climax in which Surratt and the convicted men are hanged. There are existing photographs of this scene and Redford summons with fine exactitude the original blend of formality and horror. Hence the parasol--not unlike the one flourished by Winnie in Samuel Becketts ""Happy Days""--that is held over Marys head as she walks to the scaffold. No gentleman would wish for a lady to get sunburned though her neck is about to be snapped. One of the executioners even sports a festive straw boater as if planning a day on the river. (In Becketts play Winnies husband wears one too.) As Mary is hooded we switch to her point of view so that her final sight on earth--like that of a tragic heroine with the curtain starting to fall--is of a crowd staring up at her in wordless curiosity. Only at the last at the hour of Mary Surratts death do we feel the full and rousing force of her life and the iniquity of her treatment under the law. Better late than never I suppose.

No less than D.W. Griffith tried it twice Both ""Birth of a Nation"" and ""Abraham Lincoln"" portrayed the event with decent build-up but very little payoff. A long-gestating adaptation of James L. Swansons ""Manhunt The 12-Day Chase for Lincolns Killer"" holds potential for freeing the events from historical rigidity. But even 146 years after his death Lincolns legacy contains such sacred connotations that filmmakers still shy away from anything but cautious portrayals. Now Robert Redford has returned to the scene of the crime with a stuffy costume drama and the same fastidious allegiance to history. ""The Conspirator"" opens with a swift recreation of the assassination and then turns to the trial of 42-year-old Mary Surratt (Robin Wright) whose son plotted the assassination with John Wilkes Booth at Surratts boarding house. The complexities of these morally ambiguous proceedings soon become a dry legal thriller. The story focuses on conflicted defense attorney Frederick Aiken (James McAvoy) a Civil War hero initially convinced of Surratts guilt until he becomes her sole defender. James Solomons screenplay emphasizes Aikens transition into a principled humanitarian facing down the harsh military tribunal led by Secretary of War Edwin Stanton (Kevin Kline). Aiken whose post-legal career found him working as a journalist ascertains the tribunals motive for indicting Surratt as mainly a form of image control Unable to capture her son they refuse to let his spot in the trial go unfilled. It should be said that ""The Conspirator"" is reasonably well-acted by a cast that relishes the opportunity to don period costumes and make the setting come to life. The cinematography by Newton Thomas Sigel (""Valkyrie"") obtains a near-sepia look that distinguishes the era in popular memory. However while Redford frames the drama with a tense atmosphere it doesnt shake the sense that were watching a tame made-for-TV affair. For a brief moment in the scenes following the assassination Redford finds an intriguing angle by staging it as a detective story. But then the rushed exposition arrives glossing over the hunt for Booth and the subsequent capture of his co-conspirators and Aikens case becomes the focus of the straightforward plot. Redfords last great movie was ""Quiz Show"" which also dealt with a landmark tale of injustice that took place in the public eye. There however he grappled with events on a deeply personal level. ""The Conspirator"" by comparison has a rigid textbook-like feel. As with his last directing credit 2007s ""Lions for Lambs"" the extensive debates about civil responsibility veer into didactic territory. Aiken is a solid hero for a patriotic cause but that cant save ""The Conspirator"" from proceedings that lack momentum. Its possible that the only hope for rejuvenating Lincoln on film will come with the upcoming release of ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"" because Redfords treatment simply sucks the life out of the material. HOW WILL IT PLAY? Redfords name will raise the movies profile somewhat but most audiences wont both with this unimaginative work which has garnered mixed reviews since its premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival. criticWIRE grade C+ Roadside Attractions will release ""The Conspirator"" nationwide April 15.

A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Robin Wright plays Surratt but seen through the limited vantage of her defense shes not the films star. Maryland Senator Reverdy Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) decides that no Southerner can represent Surratt without compromising the case so hands her over to Union Army vet Frederick Aiken (James McAvoy). All of 28 and vainly trying to pass as older under a sparse reddish beard dubious ex-blue-belly Aiken becomes convinced that Surratts trial is nothing short of a railroading headed toward judicial murder on the gallows.Square-jawed and knotty-fingered with the look of having been dragged around by life Wright fits her part and period but McAvoys Aiken is the one who carries and stumbles with the film. Aiken is chosen to represent Surratt in part for his wartime credentials--hes introduced bleeding on a History Channel battlefield--but nothing in McAvoys pushover peevishness suggests knowledge of command or the burdensome memory of war. This would matter little if there was any transference from Surratt if Aiken absorbed her toughness through their partnership but such gravitas never arrives. The story is one of idealistic youth speaking truth to power with Kevin Klines Secretary of War Edwin Stanton the archetypal cynical insider but after Aikens closing argument youre mostly stirred to watch Danny Hustons prosecuting attorney break him.Showing a government system as it responds to an attack The Conspirator is Robert Redfords first film since the awful--and similarly themed--Lions for Lambs (2007). Redford never the subtlest of dialectic filmmakers has now become the browbeating professor he played in Lions dotting rhetorical is for the audience in every scene (""In times of war the law falls silent"").His latest lecture is the debut production of the American Film Company (motto ""Witness History"") created by Chicago entrepreneur and Cubs owner Joe Ricketts to bring our past accurately to the screen--an endeavor that on paper at least sounds worthy. Since Raoul Walshs John Wilkes Booth blew flash powder down Lincolns collar in Birth of a Nation the events surrounding the Lincoln assassination have been dramatized surprisingly infrequently Virginia Gregg played Surratt in an Ida Lupino-directed episode of The Joseph Cotten Show from 1956 while John Ford attempted a posthumous exoneration of Dr. Samuel Mudd the Maryland doctor accused of conspiracy after setting Booths broken leg in The Prisoner of Shark Island (1936).The Conspirator though fails to blow dust off its period. The historically obscure figure of Aiken is hardly vivified. Courtroom scenes are stagey with cued-up gasps and canned laughter. Redford shows some flair with assassinations and executions but the most done to enliven the dialogue is having Aiken and Johnson talk while the latter is using the bathroom. After the first reel theres rarely any sense of a larger polis outside the museum-room interiors uniformly lit by cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel in clear streaming shafts of perpetual-noon sunlight. The film is a burdensome two hours even as some scenes seem to have gone missing like the brushed-past plot point with Shea Whigham as a witness for the defense suborned by the prosecution wasted along with Alexis Bledel and Evan Rachel Wood.Convicted through essentially a single testimony Surratt was hanged with three others in July 1865. There is a famous photo in which you can see her swinging to their left bound up in a black dress. Mary Surratt and Sam Mudd were both perhaps innocent--this is beyond movies to prove. But Redfords dudgeon and bludgeon is a mere classroom aid next to Fords mythical-historical consciousness and redemptive rawness or--to seek a less canonical comparison just down the multiplex hall--next to the workmanlike plotting and fizz of The Lincoln Lawyer.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review The Black-Ops Fairy Tale Hanna is a very strange mix of paranoia pyrotechnics and fable. By David Edelstein Published Apr 8 2011 ShareThis Saoirse Ronan in Hanna.  (Photo Alex Bailey/Courtesy of Focus Features) Something spooky happens in the artfully delirious new thriller Hanna when natural light hits Saoirse Ronans pale-blue eyes. Playing a motherless teen raised in the Arctic wilderness and trained as a warrior by her rogue-CIA-agent father (Eric Bana) Ronan has unruly coils of white-blonde hair and a near-albino cast; her features are virtually bleached out. When Hanna reenters civilization she moves warilythere are assassins everywhereyet in childish wonderment. Those eyes linger briefly on electric lights television sets and fellow teenagers as if trying to process what they see their otherworldly glow like the nuclear fusion of little mermaid and machine. The Little Mermaid references are right there onscreen along with Hansel and Gretel and more from the Brothers Grimm The climax unfolds outside something called Grimms House in an empty amusement park where the films wicked witch (Cate Blanchett) strides out of a ride tunnel through the jaws of a wolf. Yes this farrago of fairy tale and sci-fi conspiracy flick is on one level howlingly obvious. But there are howls of derision and howls of amazement and mine were of the latter kind mostly. Director Joe Wright turns Hanna into a crazily inspired parablea tour de forceof growing up separating from parents and taking on the false mother the big bad bitch with longbows guns and martial arts. The first half of Hanna is the better by leagues. Theres a timeless quality to the early scenes in the toasty Arctic cabin in which Hanna and her father Erik wear pelts and he tells her he knows shell one day want to leave the nest and that when she does shell come face-to-face with Marissa Wiegler (Blanchett) and one of them will die. Why? Thats the mystery. Theres no music until CIA choppers descend on the cabin with a deafening metallic shudder that segues imperceptibly into a Chemical Brothers techno-blastand then Hanna wakes up in a subterranean room surrounded by cameras like Dali-esque eyeballs. What follows is a stunning merger of thriller pyrotechnics and surrealism a stroboscopic chase through tunnels past giant swirling fans. The visual punch line in the Moroccan desert makes no geographic sense but is as Ive said the amazing kind of howler. Blanchetts performance is the other kind. But give her points for embodying the freakiest of control freakscompulsively flossing until her gums bleed her frozen mask a study in murderous repression. Vying with her for overacting honors is Tom Hollander who plays a hired assassin as a sadistic queen in a yellow tracksuit who whistles while he works (and awkwardly while he lurks). The narrative gets diffuse toward the endbackstories are often letdowns when they come to the front. What keeps us hooked is Ronan a young actress of seemingly limitless abilities and the tension she creates between Hannas inhumanly agile body and quizzical eyes which turn cold only when she pulls the trigger. Robert Redfords The Conspirator centers on the trial of Mary Surratt (Robin Wright) who ran a boardinghouse frequented by the men who plotted to kill Abraham Lincoln among them John Wilkes Booth and her own son. Arrested along with many others after the assassination she is judged by a military tribunal that has no inclination whatever the evidence to let anyone offincensing her hitherto reluctant lawyer Aiken (the excellent James McAvoy). It is Aiken who articulates the message that the Constitution mustpace the vengeful Secretary of War Stanton (Kevin Kline)apply to all guilty or innocent in peace or in peril. It would be easy to dismiss The Conspirator as a dramatized civil-liberties lecture with obvious implications re Guantanamo. But if the decade since 9/11 has taught us anything its that we havent been very well taught. Redford does a fine economical job re-creating the horror of the assassination the dying president barely glimpsed but the bowls of blood carried from his deathbed all too vivid. And because Wrights Surratt is so starkly private even withholding her fate becomes part of a larger tragedy. The screenwriter James Solomon does the poor job only a liberal could at making the case for a Cheneyesque dark side and he isnt helped by Klines wooden acting. Too bad. The Conspirator is eloquent enough to let the other side have its say. In Arthur the spectacularly grating remake of Steve Gordons 1981 P. G. Wodehouse simulation (this time Peter Baynham miswrote Jason Winer misdirected) Russell Brand gives a career-killing performance. In the grisly opening his drunken heir dons a Batman suit forces Luis Guzman (as his luckless chauffeur) into Burt Ward shorts and leaps into his Batmobile for a joyride through Manhattan. Brands voice is a falsetto bray his elongated teeth flat-out scary. After an ineptly staged chase the Batmobile ends up under the Wall Street bull statue its testicles dangling over Brands face. Drunk again Arthur says a copa line that worked better in the original when Arthur was behind the wheel. (Back then DWIs could be passed off as high jinks.) The desperate editing the falsetto the neutered gagthose bull balls read like Brands symbolic castration. 1 2 Next Share this story...

With this dastardly attack and after the greatest loss of civilian lives the U.S. had ever known the federal government abridged the liberties of those it suspected of giving aid and comfort to the nations enemies. It tried civilians in military courts deprived them of due process suspended the right of habeus corpus. The few lawyers to speak up in defense of the accused were overruled or drowned out by high government officials who spun fantasies into imminent threats predicting anarchy if the suspects were not railroaded to conviction. And when it couldnt find the real perpetrators of the attack the government went after people who might slake the countrys thirst for righteous revenge. The news of course was of Abraham Lincolns bloody death a few days after the Civil War ended. The vindictive government officials included Secretary of War Edwin Stanton. The civilian on trial in a military court was Mary Surratt whose son John was part of the plot that killed Lincoln. Despite a spirited defense by a young war hero Frederick Aiken she was convicted of treason by a Commission that recommended she be sentenced to life in prison. President Johnson overruled that sentence -- as well as the writ of habeus corpus Aiken had secured -- and on July 7 1865 Mary Surratt was hanged. She was the first woman to be executed by the U.S. government. (See photos of Abraham Lincoln.) (See pictures of movie costumes.) The most troubling and satisfying aspect of The Conspirator director Robert Redfords account of the Surratt case is the comparison it draws between the actions taken by the Andrew Johnson administration immediately after the event of Apr. 14 1865 -- the first assassination of a U.S. President -- and the Bush Administrations actions in the months and years after the events of Sept. 11 2001. In this movie (produced by online-trading billionaire Joe Ricketts American Film Company) Stanton is the stand-in for Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld; he proposes lurid theories of revolution and when challenged replies ""Whos to say these things couldnt happen?"" In a direct parallel to the Bush administrations invasion of Iraq as a crowd-pleasing alternative to the fruitless search for Osama bin Laden one Surratt sympathizer says that Stanton amp; Co. are trying Mary ""because they cant find John."" This may sound like catnip to Bush-whackers and an outrage or a yawn to everybody else. But this retelling of a crucial poorly-remembered chapter of American law and war has enough atmosphere stalwart acting and suspense to appeal to the mass of moviegoers even those indifferent to the primacy of justice over vengeance. In Redfords starchy but provocative version Union war hero Frederick Aiken (James McAvoy) is persuaded by Maryland Senator Reverdy Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) to defend Mary Surratt (Robin Wright) at her trial. Screenwriters James D. Solomon and Gregory Bernstein have added an Aiken girlfriend (Alexis Bledel) and a pal (Justin Long) for home cooking but the movie story is essentially the real one. Aiken presses his case against prosecuting attorney Joseph Holt (Danny Huston) quizzes John Surratt associate Louis Weichmann (Glees Jonathan Groff) and searches for helpful evidence in Marys boarding house where her daughter Anna (Evan Rachel Wood) still lives. (See the 100 best movies of all time.) Thirty years after his directorial debut with the Oscar-winning Ordinary People Redford comes to this period piece with a visual style that is both stately and obvious. In Marys prison cell shafts of blinding light form the window giving her the third degree. Redford swathes the proceedings in artfully desaturated color and soft-focus back-lighting -- just enough to let viewers know theyre in the 19th century not enough to distract them from the story. He might have chosen his leading player more wisely McAvoy the young Scottish actor whos been impressive as a romantic proletarian (Atonement) a roguish journalist (the BBC series State of Play) and a wimp turned action hero (Wanted) plays Aiken as a bit too callow and tentative. The rest of the cast does fine by their roles. Kline and Huston provide different sides of the same government coin one a zealot for finding villains and scapegoats and never mind which is which; the other as a dispassionate advocate for his client and who at the end quotes Ciceros maxim that ""in times of war the law falls silent."" The shining star is Wright who brings drama and beauty to every role just by staring into the camera. She gets to offer more here the sullen fiery dignity of a woman who is as sure of her allegiance to the defeated Confederacy (she calls Lincoln ""your President"") as she is of her innocence -- and her fate at the grasping hands of Stanton and his government gang. (See the best movies of the decade.) Wrights performance is the key to a movie that pulses with the sick thrill of historical discovery. The Conspirator reminds us that. when we surrendered so many of our Constitutional rights and judgments after 9/11 it wasnt the first time. How can we be sure it will be the last?

The Globe and Mail Published Sunday Sep. 12 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Thursday Aug. 23 2012 424PM EDT Comments Print /License AA The following short reviews of films opening on Sunday Sept. 12 at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival are by James Adams James Bradshaw Guy Dixon Rick Groen Liam Lacey Gayle MacDonald Dave McGinn J. Kelly Nestruck Johanna Schneller and Brad Wheeler. The star ratings are out of four. The Conspirator Robert Redford (USA) 3 STARS This is by no means a great movie but in telling a gripping and little-known true story with many contemporary resonances it has time(liness) on its side. Its 1865 the Union has pretty much clinched victory in the American Civil War when suddenly President Lincoln is assassinated by Confederate zealot John Wilkes Booth. Fear and anxiety grip the nation. Hundreds of citizens are rounded up including Mary Surratt (Robin Wright) a widow and Southern sympathizer whose son is an associate of Booth. Eventually shes lumped in with the other assassin conspirators and tried before a military commission where her rookie lawyer (James McAvoy) also a decorated Union soldier isnt so sure she should be saved from the gallows. Redford doesnt belabour the parallels between then and now now and then but theyre striking (and apt) nevertheless. A fine cast (including Kevin Kline Evan Rachel Wood and Tom Wilkinson) strives mightily to personalize the tale but finally theyre just passengers on a great engine of plot. JA Sunday Sept. 12 12 noon Ryerson; Sept. 19 245 p.m. Varsity The Illusionist (Lillusionniste) Sylvain Chomet (U.K.) 3 STARS A surprisingly melancholic homage to the great French filmmaker Jacques Tati. This animated feature from the director of The Triplets of Belleville has no manic scenes or even outright moments of hilarity. Instead it pleasingly and quietly follows a character resembling the angular and awkward Tati as an itinerant magician who finds himself in Scotland. Along the way a young girl tags along creating a father-daughter bond which never fully explains itself. It never needs to. Based on an unproduced script by Tati himself the story was thought to the late filmmakers message to his daughter while Chomets own daughter went through her teen years as he made this film. What both filmmakers left for us is a beautiful ambiguous dream. G.D. Sept. 12 230 p.m. Elgin; Sept. 19 630 p.m. Bell Lightbox 2 West Is West Andy De Emmony (U.K.) 3 STARS This is a sequel to East Is East the 1999 hit family comedy about a Pakistani family living in Salford England and their struggles with their Old World father George Khan (Om Puri) and Caucasian mother (Linda Bassett). The new movie picks up in 1975 when George decides to sort out his unruly youngest son Sajid on a journey back to Pakistan leaving his wife (temporarily) at home. As in the previous film the form is peculiar a blend of cultural-alienation drama and sitcom. Puri is compelling as George a hypocrite who holds his children to standards of conduct he doesnt meet. His conflicted character can seem out of place against the broadness of the Carry On Gang-style humour. But somehow the idea that the struggles of culture shock can be both psychologically traumatizing and a bit of a laugh works. L.L. Sept. 12 130 p.m. Roy Thomson; Sept. 14 1230 p.m. Winter Garden; Sept. 18; 615 p.m. Scotiabank 2 You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger Woody Allen (U.K./USA/Spain) 3 STARS This decent second-rank Woody Allen comedy features a cast led by Anthony Hopkins Naomi Watts and Josh Brolin in a moody farce about romantic delusions and practical disappointments. Helena Shepridge (Gemma Jones) visits a psychic after shes been ditched by her husband of 40 years Alfie (Hopkins) who has taken up with a call girl (a scene-stealing Lucy Punch). Helena and Alfies daughter curator Sally (Watts) is wed to blocked novelist Roy (Brolin) but both have roving eyes. He begins to flirt with a comely neighbour (Freida Pinto) while she fantasizes about her unhappily married boss Greg (Antonio Banderas). None of this breaks new ground but as is often the case with Allen the ridiculous absurdities of the characters undermine the habitual pessimistic pose. L.L.
