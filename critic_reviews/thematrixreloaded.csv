Comments The Matrix Reloaded Rated R  138 minutes  2003 The first of two sequels to The Matrix released in 2003 courtesy of the original writer-directors the Wachowskis who have amplified the camp elements of the original--including the ultrasolemn performances of Keanu Reeves Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss--while retreading the same metaphysical conceits. Lines like ""Were all here to do what were here to do"" reverberate more than long enough for us to ponder their full profundity and the martial arts choreography is neither graceful nor exciting--its worthy of a video game. Only after cars trucks and a motorcycle join the action--easily outclassing all the actors--does the movie take on a modicum of vitality. But if youre 14 or younger in age or sensibility you may giggle at some of the bons mots.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

Starring Keanu Reeves Carrie-Anne Moss Laurence Fishburne. Directed and written by Andy and Larry Wachowski. (R. 138 minutes.) Turns out the first ""Matrix"" was the One but the second is still loads of fun. ""The Matrix Reloaded"" which was filmed partly in the Bay Area faced a tougher task than most sequels in trying to stay fresh. Filmmaking brothers Andy and Larry Wachowskis original ""Matrix"" had revolutionized the action genre only to see its signature moves co-opted by everything from ""Scary Movie"" to ""Shrek."" ""The Matrix"" came out four years ago -- eons in special-effects terms. While ""Reloaded"" contains nothing as truly innovative as its predecessor the Wachowskis create something fresh anyway by cramming ""Reloaded"" with the stuff fans crave. Fight scenes? Theyre frequent long and intricate. Fuzzy philosophizing? Even more abundant than in the original as the sequel further explores the existential chasm between people living within the computer confines of the Matrix and those on the outside. ""Reloaded"" also heats up the romance between Keanu Reeves Neo (a.k.a. ""the One"") and fellow human insurgent Trinity touchingly played by Carrie-Anne Moss. Too much turns out to be just enough to make ""Reloaded"" a worthy sequel and a nifty bridge to the trilogys conclusion coming in November. ""Reloaded"" revisits the computer-generated effects on which ""The Matrix"" made its name -- hovering combatants slo-mo bullet evasion -- while raising the stakes. The computer captors trying to wipe out rogue humans Neo Trinity and Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) display more resources. Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) exploded in the first movie but is back intact many times over replicating himself by the dozens to battle Neo. Or as the delightfully dry Weaving looking menacing but sounding like Wilford Brimley in an oatmeal ad puts it ""Me. Me. Me."" The fight becomes an extraordinary set piece with Reeves running sideways off the heads of Weaving doppelgangers while balancing on a pole. Agile as ever Reeves blocks blows with lightning speed. But how much is reflex and how much CGI? This scene like those that have Neo flying has a tendency to look like a video game. But then the Wachowskis ground things in reality or at least cinema by injecting humor When Neo finds a means of escape Weavings various Agent Smiths register different expressions from embarrassment to contempt. What most distinguishes ""The Matrix"" movies from CGI-heavy sci-fi like ""Attack of the Clones"" is their vibrant humanity. Theres an admirable purity to the human rebels cause; life would be easier had they stayed oblivious to the computer world that entrapped them where folks arent oppressed per se just unaware. Consciousness over comfort is a noble choice and its a concept captured beautifully in a sequence set in Zion a dingy bustling industrial complex that as the last human city faces threat of destruction by the Matrix army. After Morpheus rallies the crowd behind Neo as the savior of humankind bodies writhe to trance music on the dance floor -- the prevailing age demographic on Zion appears to be 18-34 -- and Neo and Trinity get busy in an alcove. Their deepening love affair becomes an integral heartfelt piece of the Matrix puzzle. When characters arent fighting or commingling theyre talking nonstop. Mindful that its impenetrability was part of the first films allure the Wachowskis pile on twists and let characters expound on nagging topics like man versus machine and ideas of fate and choice. ""What happened happened because it couldnt have happened any other way"" says Morpheus captain of conundrums. Not to worry Internet ""Matrix"" heads; clarity is never achieved. Going by the first two installments it takes a film and a half to understand one ""Matrix"" which means well figure out ""Reloaded"" at the conclusion of the third installment ""The Matrix Revolutions."" The diverse egalitarian spirit evident in Zion extends to the movie as well. Reeves might be the biggest name and ostensible star of the film but hes absent from the action for stretches. This allows Moss to shine whether delivering kicks over her shoulder or locked in a gunfight while plummeting from a high-rise. Shes the finest female action hero since Sigourney Weaver in ""Alien"" -- flinty one moment nurturing the next and slyly possessive when Italian bombshell Monica Belluccis character flirts with Neo. Ultimately ""The Matrix Reloaded"" suffers from ""Two Towers"" disease As a middle installment it lacks a real beginning or end. But unlike ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy ""The Matrix"" has no literary precursor thereby promising a surprise with every new episode. Judging by this accomplished sequel there will be plenty more to like come November. Advisory This film contains violence nudity sexual themes.

"The Matrix Reloaded We waited four years for this? Slate Sign In Sign Up The Matrix Reloaded We waited four years for this? The Matrix Reloaded We waited four years for this? Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.May 14 2003 434 PM Neo Con TheMatrix Reloaded We waited four years for this? By David Edelstein Reeves in the role of a dull earnest--but bulletproof--monk Its too bad that--unlike Neo (Keanu Reeves) the computer-hacker-turned-messianic-superhero of The Matrix Reloaded (Warner Bros.)--I cant freeze bullets in midflight and send them clinking to the ground because I have a feeling youll want to shoot the messenger. Now hold on put those guns down I wrote a 2000-word piece in last weeks New York Times in celebration of Andy and Larry Wachowskis gift in the 1999 original for bending space time and motion. True my musings were upstaged by a 2-million-word piece on Jayson Blairs gift for bending space time and motion but heres the point I went into Reloaded with the same quasi-religious expectation that my universe would be rocked. Barring that I was hoping for maybe a good night out at the movies. Advertisement The grim news is that TheMatrixReloaded is as messy and flat-footed as its predecessor is nimble and shapely. Its an ugly bloated repetitive movie that builds to a punch line that should have come an hour earlier (at least). Then it ends as its just beginning Stay tuned for The Matrix Revolutions coming in November to 8000 theaters near you. The original was above all an ontological mystery How could Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) hang suspended in midair? Why did Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) know what Neo then Thomas Anderson was up to every second? Why did Andersons life feel like a dream? The answers came gradually mind-bendingly mind-blowingly an astute mix of everything trendy in postmodern sci-fi (Philip K. Dick and his paranoid visions of the world-as-simulation) and philosophy (Jean Baudrillards view of the real obscured by materialism and technology) and everything up-to-the-minute in special effects and action. Most important once Neo took the red pill unplugged himself and entered the virtual dojo each fight developed his sense of who he was and what within the Matrix he was capable of doing; each action scene marked an ontological/metaphysical leap forward. Almost from the start Reloaded feels different from the original--more stilted mechanical blockbuster-business-as-usual Lucasoid. The picture opens with Trinity in her gleaming black cat suit sailing over a wall on a motorcycle somersaulting into a building and taking out a bunch of guards. The fighting is twice as complicated as in the opening of The Matrix--there are more stunts more guards more everything--but because its essentially the same thing all over again it has about a hundredth of the impact. A few seconds later Trinity bursts through a window and plummets backward down the side of a skyscraper while firing at an agent who leaps after her firing back the bullets carving silver tracks in the air in slow motion the shards of glass spinning like diamonds around the falling bodies. It should be amazing; it should be the coolest thing ever. But the shot has the disposable feel of a video game You can imagine the program resetting itself and then all those little zeros and ones reassembling to play again. Advertisement Its true the revelation of The Matrix was that the universe was a sort of video game a simulation in which--once you realized that yours was a virtual self and ""freed your mind""--you could transcend time and gravity. But the Wachowskis (and their special-effects supervisor John Gaeta) managed to give the action a kind of weight that was missing from even most Hong Kong movies (their inspiration). That was clearly Reeves (and Moss and Fishburne and Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith) doing the fighting the actors having trained for months (with the great Hong Kong fight choreographer Woo-Ping Yuen) to perform the gravity-defying stunts that not so long ago were only the province of honed Chinese acrobats. The cast trained even longer this time but the way the fights are staged and shot (and in some cases digitized) you wonder if they really had to. In the case of the ""Burly Brawl"" extensively hyped in a breathless piece by Steve Silberman in Wired they didnt. Gaeta and his team devised a way to digitize a battle between Neo and more than a hundred incarnations of Agent Smith from scratch inside the computer superimposing the heads of Reeves and Weaving (which had been photographed for hours with high-resolution cameras) over the bodies of digitally re-created stunt-people. That meant the filmmakers could re-animate a move or plug in another camera angle almost as easily as I can strike out a paragraph on my word processor. Again the sequence should be the coolest thing ever. Neo leaps in the air freezes kicks one Agent Smith with his front leg and another with his back. He sends one Smith somersaulting into the far distance does a back flip onto a wall and sends another few in the direction of the camera which is busy dive-bombing and swirling and whooshing around the action at speeds that would tear an ordinary camera apart. With the camera overhead scores of Smiths pile on top of Neo who blows the mound up with the force of his will then soars into the sky like Superman. The digital Neo looks like Keanu Reeves (who has a beautiful blankness to begin with) the digital Smiths look like Weaving (who has a malevolent blankness to begin with) You would hardly guess that these are simulated figures in simulated costumes. Even the fabric of Neos cloak moves the way it would in real life. Amazing Whats more amazing is how little visceral kick it has. Remember that scene in The Fly (1986) when Geena Davis tries a teleported steak and shakes her head and says ""It tastes fake""? The Burly Brawl tastes fake. It isnt so much a great action sequence as a demonstration reel for a great new technology. It makes you think ""Lets play again"" The cheesy tinny-sounding music doesnt help. Ive heard better orchestrations coming out of Game Boys. Advertisement In Reloaded Neo can fly around the Matrix in ways that remind even the other characters of Superman. Actually hes Superpriest Those long Chow-Yun-Fat-style coats have been replaced by a black cassock with a high clerics collar. A bulletproof monk The Matrix is basically his playpen now He can look the way he wants move the way he wants; he might even be able to bring back the dead. But his powers dont seem to turn him on. Neo the One is a dull earnest boy and Carrie-Anne Moss Trinity has lost that mysterioso Samp;M vibe and become rather mushy and maternal. It doesnt help that after the opening flurry of action the clutchy pair run aground in the underground city of Zion where all the worlds unplugged humans go to plan their guerrilla uprisings against the machines. The set is like a shopping mall in hell--multilevel corroded iron crammed with sweaty extras with none of the bio-mechanical feel (inspired by graphic artist Geofrey Darrow) of the hovercrafts and invading ""squiddies."" At first the Zion scenes are merely lugubrious with Morpheus his ex-lover Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith) and her pompous current lover Lock (Harry Lennix) speaking in formal orotund diction that sounds like a very bad day on Star Trek Deep Space Nine. (Cornell West shows up in a cameo and fits right in I guess thats the point.) Then we get a biblical epic a ringing address by Morpheus (""I give you--MORPHEUS"") to the assembled hordes on the coming invasion of the Romans--I mean the machines--that climaxes ""Tonight let us tremble these walls. This is Zion--and WE ARE NOT AFRAID"" This is the cue for a high-camp montage a Fellini-esque slow-motion orgy intercut with Neo and Trinity making the beast with two backs. That sound you hear is Cecil B. DeMille whacking off in his grave. Dull staging tin-eared dialogue (I havent even told you about Eurotrash king and queen of evil played by Lambert Wilson and Monica Bellucci) bad acting What went wrong? Have the Wachowskis been pickling in their own self-importance for too long? When they made the original theyd come off their terrific low-budget lesbian noir Bound (1996) and they gave The Matrix a lean no-nonsense B-movie thrust. Here they seem to be bogged down by their budget and by Owen Patersons top-heavy sets and almost every sequence goes on for too long and to no particular end. The minimal plot involves putting Neo back in the Matrix to find the Keymaker (Randall Duk Kim) who can take him to ""the Source""--the inner core--of the simulated universe. Hold on this is the scenario of a video game with each level presenting new kung-fu adversaries and more fearsome obstacles. (Among them is a pair of dreadlocked albino twins who can materialize and dematerialize in wraithlike swirls of ecto-matter. They look great but they have the personalities of twin Fabios.) The martial arts is laid on promiscuously and illogically as in the most routine Hong Kong movies and an almost half-hour highway sequence rumored to be miraculous is just another noisy car chase with people leaping off motorcycles and trucks or going the wrong way against oncoming traffic. Its often impressive (I thought ""Hmmm thats impressive"") but its nowhere near as startlingly kinetic as the climax of The Road Warrior (1981) in which the visual effects were primitive or nonexistent but the thing had a shape. The climax of Reloaded--inside the Source--is designed to look like the end of 2001 (1968) and seem just as cosmic. In a sense it is It explodes a lot of the biblical mumbo-jumbo that has preceded it forcing us to rethink the meaning of the prophecies that have guided all the actions of Morpheus--here a much more flagrant religious zealot. The question of free will versus destiny had always been a vexing one in the Wachowskis universe If part of mastering the Matrix was confronting the ways in which human beings had been in essence programmed what did it mean that there was a higher sort of programming--as embodied by the Oracle and her infallible prophecies? Were the Wachowskis really doing a straight neo-Christian (so to speak) parable? We can speculate on these things when youve seen the movie. And you will see it--and maybe even convince yourself its spectacular. (Some people thought The Phantom Menace [1999] was a good movie--theres a collective delusion for you.) But a bigger bang for your buck would be the Wachowskis related package of nine short animated films The Animatrix which proves that peoplelike cartoons can be much more enlivening than cartoonlike people. In The Matrix Neo broke through the artificial into the real; in The Matrix Reloaded hes stuck in a bigger simulation with no exit in sight.

And why not? When The Matrix came out four years ago it made most of Hollywood feel suddenly antiquated. The movie was an exuberantly mulched blend of cyberpunk kung fu movies video games comic books hip-hop Philip K. Dick groovy trench coats and operatic Hong Kong violence -- Sam Peckinpah by way of John Woo. Just like George Lucas before them filmmakers Andy and Larry Wachowski stitched the whole thing together with the kind of hokey philosophizing about illusion reality and chosen young men that makes 14-year-olds slap their heads and go ""Wow"" Actually I went ""Wow"" too. Not at the Wachowskis jejune metaphysical ruminations but at their success in creating a new cinematic landscape and cyberspace Shaolin warrior. Keanu Reeves Neo wasnt simply the one thousand and first face of Joseph Campbells ever-changing mythic hero he hit the millennial Zeitgeist with the explosive accuracy of a smart bomb. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Of course once you create such an epoch-making world the question becomes what to do with it. If youre God you rest; if youre a filmmaker you make a sequel. But how? Do you create a follow-up as boldly inventive as the original or do you play it safe and just make the franchise bigger? In Hollywood just to ask this question is to answer it. The Matrix Reloaded begins as the machines that run Earth are 72 hours from destroying the city of Zion last freehold of human beings. The only hope is the old band of rebels the enchanted Neo his tough-chick lover Trinity (hard-faced Carrie-Anne Moss) and the prophecy-spouting Morpheus played by burgeoning Laurence Fishburne whos evidently been eating rather well off his profits from the first picture. To save humanity Neo and Co. jack into the unreal world of The Matrix in search of a literal key to survival. There they encounter assorted symbolically named helpers (including The Oracle from the last film) square off with a Frenchified villain known as The Merovingian (played with curdled glee by Lambert Wilson) and battle the machine regimes murderous enforcers led by wisecracking Agent Smith (once again Australian actor Hugo Weaving) who has developed the power to duplicate himself infinitely. Through all this Neo must battle his recurring dream that Trinity will die -- her all-too-human blood spilling out from her black fetishistic body suit -- and ponder deep-dish questions What is the relationship between causality and choice? Is it possible that even rebellion is pre-programmed? Although Reloaded was originally conceived as part two of a trilogy it feels like a jerry-built sequel. The opening hour is a torpid mess all cliches and plodding franchise-enhancing mythology made worse by the cheesy conception of Zion whose citizens battle for freedom is the purest TV corn Each time Neo walks round a corner you half expect him to bump into Captain Kirk. This might matter less if we cared about the human dimension of the story -- Neos growth as a hacker messiah his desperate love for Trinity or the poignancy underlying Morpheus visionary swagger. But the Wachowskis arent exactly fabled for their emotional depth (their debut thriller Bound had all the warmth of a video-poker machine) and here the whole notion of human freedom is largely reduced to an unintentionally comical scene in which the inhabitants of Zion stage what looks like a sweaty multiracial rave party on the subterranean set of Little Nicky. An orgy of bumping and grinding this White Negro fantasy is so far over the top that I kept expecting Gary Oldman to turn up in his True Romance dreadlocks.

Sep. 13 600pm Now some of this is simply the problem of middles that also afflicted The Lord of the Rings The Two Towers and the new X-Men picture (which too is heading toward a grand finale). The second part of a trilogy is tricky because it offers neither the pleasures of introducing a new world nor the satisfactions of bringing the story to a climax. Caught in narrative limbo the Wachowskis -- like Peter Jackson and Bryan Singer before them -- lose sight of the storys essential drama and take the easy way out. They swamp part two with action hoping sheer momentum can hide the rickety storytelling. To be fair Reloaded has enough dazzling pyrotechnics to let audiences pretend they arent leaving the theater disappointed. A clever if overlong schoolyard fight between Neo and Agent Smith grows ever wilder as more and more identical Smiths arrive to attack him until the whole thing looks like the worlds craziest rugby scrum. And the Wachowskis top that with an unbelievably protracted chase-fight scene -- all crashing cars vrooming trucks and motorcycles racing against freeway traffic -- that culminates with Morpheus atop a racing truck fighting killer machines with his samurai sword. While much of this is nifty -- two trucks collide with a fabulous accordion crunch -- its also unexpectedly unexciting. With its flying kicks kangaroo leaps and spectacular backflips the original Matrix married Hong Kong stunts to Hollywood effects and made us feel we were experiencing something unique. But what was fresh in 1999 now feels tired mechanical -- theres too much slo-mo generic CGI. Indeed Reloadeds set pieces have neither the lightness and wit of the first films nor the grace of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon where each skirmish was charged with emotion. Here the action scenes have the dulling redundancy of a video game that somebody else is playing. The sequences go on getting bigger -- there are probably 25 backflips here for every one in The Matrix -- but theyre almost wholly devoid of suspense. The Wachowskis seem to think that if its exciting when Morpheus nearly falls off that moving truck itll be even more exciting if it happens six times. Ironically much of whats best about Reloaded can be found in small human touches -- notably Gloria Fosters sly performance as The Oracle and Randall Duk Kims wonderfully deft turn as The Keymaker. At their best the Wachowskis have a gift for clever pop throwaways -- theres an amusingly conceived cameo by left-wing prof Cornel West -- and for mischief They use Neos ability to fly in a scene that almost seems designed to render the upcoming Superman movie wholly redundant. Reload that Brett Ratner. Like the original Stars Wars films the Matrix trilogy offers the fantasy of a small select group rebelling against overwhelming odds (next up The Matrix Revolutions). But what are Neo and his comrades rebelling against? Although the official enemy here is the machine world the artificial reality theyve constructed looks suspiciously like the corporate global order as we now know it. Of course its hard to believe the Wachowskis mean this when they and Warner Bros. are busy selling off sponsorships to brands like POWERade. The filmmakers are slightly more sincere in their racial politics. The most sinister figures are all white men in suits while aside from Trinity -- a weathered butch woman with a mean leg kick -- the heroes are all black Asian or racially mixed. (Mr. OReilly Ms. Coulter start your engines.) Reloaded doesnt have anything truly meaningful to say about race but its proud swirl of colors underscores a huge cultural shift. These days the mass international audience -- including white American teenagers -- think nonwhite style is whats happening. And the true meaning of movies like this one finally lies in how it teaches us new ways to be cool. This is great news for Keanu Reeves whose extraordinary handsomeness at once Asian and Caucasian masculine and feminine makes Neo his ideal role. Although his acting inclines toward the wooden its always been his weird genius (if thats the term) to exude a charmed aura an uncanny sense of being the chosen one -- remember hes been the Buddha. Im not sure any other actor could play Neo nearly so well for the others would all be working to seem like The One (as hes known) while Reeves conveys that quality just by showing up. And he looks fabulous doing it. As he moves across the screen in those angled sunglasses and the long black robe of a kung fu priest -- tightly cut at the top and skirtlike at the bottom for maximum panache when kicking -- you can almost believe that The Matrix Reloaded is as cool as you thought it was going to be.

And to its credit it eventually gets one. Reeves displays even less emotion than body fat in Reloaded. AP But for all the predictably fancy footwork the heavy-handed opening hour will prove trying to all but the most forgiving fans of this alternative universe. Keanu Reeves Neo has been deemed ""The One"" savior by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) a rebel leader in Zion the last outpost of humanity. Its under attack by The Machines ""sentinel"" subordinates which aim to take it over to inherit the universe. Will this make any sense to anyone who hasnt seen the original? No. Review of the movie The Matrix Reloaded ( out of four) But as creators and brothers Larry and Andy Wachowski tell it Zion is an interior world of computer hacking ponderous pontificating (put a sock in it Morpheus) and deliriously odd rave-club dancing with visuals that recall the orgiastic sidelights in Oliver Stones The Doors and before that Cecil B. De Milles The Ten Commandments. Displaying even less emotion than body fat Reeves is vapid as Neo -- who in the movies silliest scene battles multiclones of Agent Smith (ever-cool Hugo Weaving) thought to have been disposed of in The Matrix. Mid- brawl Neo suddenly zooms off into the sky a la Superman as if to say ""Ive had my morning workout and am done with you fools."" But Neos search for a mysterious ""keymaker"" transforms the movie. Suddenly theres an edgy sexy and even witty restaurant scene laced with of all things marital tension. And Carrie-Anne Moss Trinity a plus throughout puts her own chiseled frame on a motorcycle and achieves the near-impossible putting a fresh spin -- spin being the operative word -- on the movie car chase. Salvaged by its rally Reloaded seems less tired than X2 its current sequel rival. But since its creators have said its only half of a movie we wont really know until The Matrix Revolutions arrives Nov. 5 whether this chunk is fizzle or sizzle.

"Matrix Reloaded The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; matrix-reloaded-the ) Matrix Reloaded The (United States 2003) A movie review by James Berardinelli Non-demanding fans of the original The Matrix will likely be enthralled by the second installment in the series. More demanding aficionados will likely have a few reservations some of which will not be addressed until the release of the third feature Matrix Revolutions. I fall into the latter category. Although there are things about The Matrix Reloaded that I like the movie is so open-ended and riddled with gaping holes that its virtually impossible to view this as a finished project. Writing this review makes me feel like Im putting pen to paper after seeing only half of a motion picture. At this time I recommend the movie for what it is but I reserve the right to revise that opinion in six months. It is possible a perhaps even likely a that the shadow of Matrix Revolutions will be so long that it will fundamentally impact the effectiveness of The Matrix Reloaded. The biggest problem with The Matrix Reloaded is that it is not a complete film. Moreso than other recent multi-segment movie sagas (The Lord of the Rings Back to the Future 2 amp; 3) this picture has a truncated incomplete feel a as if the ending is intended as nothing more than an intermission for a five-hour spectacle. That will be fine when the entire trilogy is available for viewing but in the summer of 2003 it represents an impediment to full enjoyment of what the Wachowski Brothers have offered. It has been four years since The Matrix reached screens but in the machine-dominated universe only six months have elapsed. During that time in large part due to the efforts of the messianic figure Neo (Keanu Reeves) the small human population inhabiting the hidden city of Zion has grown. The machines taking notice of that growth have decided to put an end to humanity. While the leaders of Zion prepare for war Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) takes Neo and Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) back into the Matrix to confer with the Oracle (the late Gloria Foster) hoping to learn how to fulfill the prophesy that will save mankind. While there Neo encounters some new adversaries a such as the deadly-but-suave Merovingian (Lambert Wilson) and his seductive wife Persephone (Monica Bellucci) a and an old one a the indefatigable Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) who is literally beside himself. The Matrix Reloaded delivers what a segment of the viewing audience expects a visually dynamic action sequences separated by interludes of wordy often pretentious exposition. The only real intellectual titillation comes at the end when the storyline lurches forward in a moderately unexpected direction. One of the best things about The Matrix is that it was smart as well as visceral. While its not fair to call The Matrix Reloaded dumb its not on the same level as its predecessor at least as far as intelligence goes. The movies characters often pontificate about choice fate and causality but once you delve beneath the sheath of cryptic language you discover that theyre not saying much thats new or interesting. There isnt much in the way of character development. The three protagonists are pretty much as we left them four years ago although Neo has grown into his powers to the point where hes virtually indestructible within the Matrix. Hes Superman in black with no Kryptonite in sight. That limits the adrenaline level of his action sequences since theres never any sense that he could lose a battle. When the fight involves Trinity and Morpheus however thats a different matter. These two are decidedly vulnerable and therefore represent Neos Achilles heel. Keanu Reeves looks so good in Neos gothic costume that it almost doesnt matter that hes not much of an actor. Hes a great icon around which to design a bunch of special effects and he doesnt trip over his dialogue. (Not that he has mucha|) On the other hand if youre looking for a hero to bond with Neos not the best choice. Reeves underplaying whether calculated or not distances him from the audience. On the other hand both Moss and Fishburne hold their own with the latter repeatedly commanding the cameras attention. Hugo Weaving taking a break from playing Elrond the Elf brings his wonderfully dry wit to the part of Agent Smith. Lambert Wilson oozes false charm and has the films best one-liner (I wont repeat it here but it has something to do with French cursing). Monica Bellucci is wasted but she still looks great. Jada Pinkett Smith has a small role as Niobe an ex-flame of Morphius who now captains another ship. While some viewers will be disappointed with the movies inability to constantly engage the intellect few will be anything less than awed by its eye candy. If theres one area in which The Matrix Reloaded tops The Matrix its in the visual effects department (not a surprise considering the budgets of the movies). This is a great looking motion picture. Darkness abounds and the Wachowskis take full advantage of its atmospheric possibilities with nearly every scene transpiring in locales where man-made lights fight a losing battle to hold back the shadows. There are some amazing shots in and around Zion (including an Engineering room more elaborate than anything in Scottys wet dreams) and some Terminator-like views of the machines as they go to work. And the climax to the films centerpiece action sequence a a lengthy convoluted car chase a is breathtaking to behold. There are of course a large number of fight scenes. These include some relatively ""simple"" (and not terribly energetic) ones a Neo fighting a few agents Trinity trying to survive a vicious onslaught Neo ""proving"" that hes ""The One"" to a skeptical guardian etc. But there are also three big ones. The first involves an elaborate confrontation between Neo and Agent Smith that ends with the Superman in black tangling with a small army while performing all sorts of gravity-defying stunts and using an iron pole as a baseball bat. (All thats missing is Vin Scully or Harry Kalas doing play-by-play.) The second has Neo stopping a lot of bullets in the ""usual"" way then fending off a dozen or so bad guys. Then theres the car chase which comes close to re-inventing the worn-out action staple. This isnt the usual boring one-guy-chases-the-other-until-someone-crashes sequence. It goes on for a very long time through various permutations until it concludes with a literal bang. Good stuff and worth the price of admission even for those who are normally lulled to sleep by car chases. (Count me in that category.) When The Matrix was released in 1999 it was not expected to be a big hit. Its stunning success surprised nearly everyone including Warner Brothers. It cost about 60 million and grossed nearly three times that domestically. The video release widened its audience and increased its popularity. Production delays have meant a longer wait for the sequel than anyone intended resulting in a Matrix feeding frenzy. As always when expectations are this high theres bound to be a level of disappointment. Whether it becomes the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time or the biggest movie of the summer is of interest only to those who view box-office results like sports scores. On balance The Matrix Reloaded does an admirable job of filling the niche its supposed to a that of an action-oriented science fiction adventure. Only time and Matrix Revolutions will determine if the material contained here is just a noisy visually lively distraction or whether there are deeper currents were not yet aware of.

"CNN.com - Review Matrix visually stunning but empty - May. 14 2003 The Web CNN.com Home Page World U.S. Weather Business Sports Politics Law Technology Science amp; Space Health Entertainment Travel Education Special Reports SERVICES Video E-mail Newsletters CNNtoGO SEARCH Web CNN.com Overview | Gallery | Quiz Review Matrix visually stunning but empty Special effects overwhelm everything By Paul ClintonCNN Reviewer Keanu Reeves returns as Neo in ""The Matrix Reloaded."" Story Tools RELATED  Gallery The Matrix Reloaded character guide  More Matrix -- at least the half of it  Taking Matrix to the next FX level  From 1999 Myth meets Internet in Matrix  TIME.com Secrets of the new Matrix  Official site The Matrix (CNN) -- ""The Matrix Reloaded"" is a mind-blowing state-of-the-art effects extravaganza that will take your breath away. The Wachowski brothers the creators of ""The Matrix"" franchise and this second edition of the ground-breaking trilogy have once again raised the bar regarding what is possible in an action/adventure blockbuster. Unfortunately the result is not really a feature film. Its a video game. A damn good video game but a video game nevertheless -- albeit one hot-wired to the joystick of every video junkie/adolescent male in the universe. Because of that it will make hundreds of millions of dollars. All the main players have returned. Laurence Fishburne reprises his role as as Morpheus a mystic teacher who thinks he has found a reluctant prophet in the form of Thomas ""Neo"" Anderson once again played by Keanu Reeves. Carrie-Anne Moss slips into latex again as Trinity Neos love interest and a fellow freedom fighter against the machines. Also back -- and back and back and back and back again -- is the evil Agent Smith played again and again and again by Hugo Weaving. Coming back for more If you saw the original ""Matrix"" then beware this sequel is the second verse same as the first. The evil Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) challenges Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) in ""The Matrix Reloaded."" Thats not to say the ante hasnt been raised in regard to the computer-generated images (CGI). It has -- big time. The effects are best displayed in the fight sequences as the camera appears to sweep around 360 degrees then spin inside out. Ditto for the effects created to show the machines as they relentlessly dig toward the human city of Zion. But all of these staggering images do little to enhance the innate drama of the story or advance any kind of real character development. Ultimately all the razzle-dazzle becomes mind-numbingly repetitive and drains the film of any tension involving the main players. No matter how many times Neo destroys the evil agents they just keep coming back like malevolent Energizer bunnies. (Or is that redundant?) As in the original ""The Matrix Reloaded"" is full of mumbo-jumbo regarding spiritualism and Eastern philosophy mixed with Hong Kong-style martial arts fights cyberpunk action and slam edits. But the slow-motion bends and the mind-boggling visuals such as ""bullet time"" and other CGI tricks used in both films have lost some of their ability to amaze and surprise. Another issue may be that when ""The Matrix"" first appeared in the spring of 1999 with its ""man against machines"" mind-set it hit a deep nerve with the moviegoing public. At the time rumors were running rampant about the Y2K bug. Those fears of course proved groundless and three-plus years later the subject has lost its urgency. Strong silent niche Neo and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) expand their romantic relationship in ""The Matrix Reloaded."" Its no secret that Reeves -- while universally liked by his peers -- is a movie star whose acting talents are marginal at best. Whenever he attempts a layered performance with subtext and nuance -- or a lot of dialogue -- its a disaster. (Two cases in point the unwatchable ""A Walk In The Clouds"" in 1995 or ""Sweet November"" in 2001.) But he does excel at playing the strong silent type a la Gary Cooper or Alan Ladd and with the ""Matrix"" franchise hes found a niche. Fishburne and Moss are mostly reduced to reacting against blue screens instead of acting. Nevertheless they do the best they can with the limited script. Weaving as Agent Smith is given little to do but appear menacing. All in all ""The Matrix Reloaded"" is visually astounding and aimed like a heat-seeking missile at its key audience of male viewers between the ages of 14 and 22. Unfortunately those under 17 cant get into an R-rated movie (well theyre not supposed to be able to get in) and even if their parents take them its unlikely that parents will go again and again which is what turns summer films into summer blockbusters. On the other hand the original also rated R did make 460 million worldwide and millions more on DVD. So despite its faults ""The Matrix Reloaded"" will be a contender for the summers box office champ even though it is -- in the end -- a group of underdeveloped characters in search of a plot. ""The Matrix Reloaded"" opens nationwide on Thursday May 15 and is rated R. The film was produced by Warner Bros. which is a division of AOL Time Warner -- also the parent company of CNN.

Posted May 30 2003 -- 1200 AM EDT An insanely pretentious and dazzling cyberaction sequel. Neo (Keanu Reeves) the former hacker who has been unplugged from the technological delusions of the Matrix is now grappling with the paradox of predestination If he has been ordained as ""the One"" does he have any more choice than those enslaved by the Matrix? These are the sorts of thoughts that lead everywhere and nowhere and much of the film is weighed down by an atmosphere of sodden junky faux-Kubrickian philosophizing. And yet. If The Matrix Reloaded is a trip through high-toned mediocrity its one of the most wizardly mediocre movies in quite some time. The sci-fi fight scenes including a spectacular 14-minute chase fly past the first film in terms of imaginative logistics; they just about make your eyeballs dance.

Their movie made piles of money but the franchise for all its fancy philosophical aspirations had lost its mystique. Six months later it would be hard to find anyone who hadnt adjusted his expectations for ""The Matrix Revolutions"" the trilogys finale.The brothers pick up just where they left off with Zion bracing itself for the ultimate attack of the Sentinels and Neo emerging from his comatose state to continue his quest to save humanity. If you missed the second part you will be hopelessly lost. Even if you saw it expect more confusion than your average action movie delivers. Now its not just a matter of man vs. machine but humans and programs and machines with competing interests. To further complicate matters The Oracle has changed appearances (with Mary Alice taking over the role beautifully played by the late Gloria Foster) and the power of the ever-duplicating Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) has grown so great hes now as much a threat to the Machines as he is to Neo.Nonetheless ""The Matrix Revolutions"" is more of a straightforward race-against-the-clock action movie than its predecessors. Its centerpiece is a near-25-minute battle in which the Zion population stages a valiant last stand against a swarming army of squidlike Sentinels a wild sequence so densely crammed with flying metal flaming weapons and smashed architecture it verges on abstraction if Jackson Pollock had made science-fiction action movies they might look something like this. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week This sequence also makes clear the movies debt to James Camerons ""Aliens."" But the Wachowskis for all their conceptual daring and visual flair dont have Camerons gift for sustaining suspense or for keeping emotions engaged. The Neo-Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) romance is barely room temperature and the love story between Zee (Nona Gaye) and Link (Harold Perrineau) as well as the implied one between Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and daredevil pilot Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith) are dutiful at best.The original ""Matrix"" was full of dizzying surprises. But its turned out that the Wachowskis didnt have many more tricks up their sleeves. How many times do we want to watch Neo kick the indestructible Agent Smith through a wall? How many times do we want to hear people tell Neo they believe in him? ""The Matrix Revolutions"" is better paced than ""Reloaded"" and its free of that movies embarrassingly clunky moments. Still aside from a few halfhearted jokes its a pretty solemn affair full of portentous proclamations and heavenly choirs to underscore Neos transformation into a Christ-like Savior. Though theyre full of undeniably spectacular moments great production values and unusual ambition a simple thing has gotten lost in these sequels theyre not much fun.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

This continuation of the 1999 B.O. blockbuster delivers enough thrills kicks and cool moments to satiate geeks fans and mere general viewers worldwide -- until the ""Revolutions"" installment wraps up the trilogy in November. Stuck with the daunting challenge of topping the artistic/commercial/cultural hat trick that was ""The Matrix"" the Wachowski Brothers score a somewhat more straightforward power-play goal in ""The Matrix Reloaded."" Studded with remarkable action set-pieces and graced with any number of felicitous performances this continuation of the 1999 B.O. blockbuster stylistic trend-setter and would-be cinematic Rosetta stone certainly delivers enough thrills kicks and cool moments to satiate geeks fans and mere general viewers worldwide -- until the ""Revolutions"" installment wraps up the trilogy in November. But anticipation is so high and the cultural attention span so fickle its fair to wonder if reality can quite match the fantasy of expectation especially since ""Reloaded"" is more conventionally plotted more reminiscent of other films and less novel and mysterious than its predecessor. Up to one-quarter of the originals 460 million worldwide gross will doubtless be drawn on the North American opening weekend which stars May 15 and every expectation is that the picture will rule in a summer dominated by other franchise sequels. The first film a March release preceded by little hype or awareness caught on quickly with young viewers and gradually developed almost unique mass-cult status due to its edgy comic-book sensibility cyber-hipness new-look Asian martial arts variations devastating fashion sense and intellectual/philosophical/religious samplings that spawned a thousand Web sites and inspired undergraduates to crack open their Hegel Schopenhauer and Heidegger with a renewed sense of dedication. Studio executives must still be kicking themselves for not having thought earlier to invest kick-butt action with references to Buddha-via-Hesse and the Book of Daniel but it took Andy and Larry Wachowski to do it. Enabled by their ""Matrix"" success to continue the story they had always envisioned as a trilogy the brothers have made everything exponentially bigger than before -- by morphing Agent Smith a hundred times over by turning Neo not only into the One but into Superman in the bargain by building their own freeway to stage the Greatest Car Chase Ever Filmed. Its all superbly staged and eye-popping to watch but no matter how stupendous the action becomes theres nothing anyone can do about the fact its no longer quite as fresh or surprising as it was the first time around. While ""The Matrix"" could be initially confounding and mystifying the conflicts and perils in ""Reloaded"" are as clear as in an episode of ""Star Trek."" After an explosive anime-style teaser in which Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss looking more buff than ever) attacks an apparent h.q. and catapults out a window down toward seemingly certain doom as she fires at pursuing agents above her attention shifts to the city of Zion discussed but unseen in the original. The last outpost of humankind on Earth its about to be assaulted by an army of tentacled sentinels sent to eliminate the last holdouts to Machine rule. Notwithstanding that the heart of Zion looks like a combination of a smoldering multicultural disco from any Joel Silver production and a picture of Old Testament debauchery out of DeMille the rebellious outpost is ruled by a council of reason and sensibility. But carrying the day upon arrival is the errant Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) who insists in a thunderous speech that after 100 years of warfare the One is at hand who can turn near-extinction to victory. As for Neo (Keanu Reeves) hes gone through some changes since embracing his destiny. For starters hes in the passionate early stages of romance with Trinity. Although burdened by self-doubt -- ""I wish I knew what I was supposed to do"" he laments at the outset -- hes much better equipped to dowhatever might be required having gained the ability to fly. When he ultimately arrives in Zion to accept his assignment he is greeted like a true savior. Almost in the manner of an old Hollywood biblical epic this early stage of the film is drenched in equal parts sex and ritual as a needlessly overdone dance/orgy inspired by Morpheus sermon to the multitudes is intercut with Neo and Trinity locked in sweaty lovemaking. Neo then begins his Homeric quest in the Real World with a visit to the Oracle (the late and glorious Gloria Foster). In this wonderfully written and performed scene this seemingly ordinary middle-aged black woman inspires Neo and instructs him to seek a man named the Keymaker. But Neo is immediately greeted by presumed-dead nemesis Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) who promptly replicates himself again and again until there are 100 Agent Smiths battling Neo in a city courtyard. Designed to amaze by outsizing the originals Neo-Smith the characters here bend contort run jump hit and chop in dizzying combinations before Neo sends dozens of Smiths tumbling like so many bowling pins. As stunning as the sequence is however the martial-arts scenes this time around appear to be framed tighter and to have more cuts in them which slightly reduces their classical rigor and distinction. The quest for the Keymaker leads Neo Trinity and Morpheus to an audience in a fancy restaurant with Merovingian (Lambert Wilson). A handsome sophisticated French snob Merovingian delivers a monologue about human choice and causality before heading to an assignation with a woman in the ladies room. His gorgeous wife Persephone (Monica Bellucci) vengefully agrees to lead the humans to the Keymaker but with a provocative condition Inspired by the ardor between Neo and Trinity Persephone demands a passionate kiss from Neo. The Keymaker turns out to be a diminutive Asian (Randall Duk Kim) who literally does have the key to everything. But Merovingians goons particularly some malevolent albino twins are close behind and this pursuit sets up the pictures most galvanizing sequence a 14-minute high-speed freeway chase in which Trinity first in a car then on a motorcycle attempts to spirit the Keymaker out of harms way while Morpheus wards off assailants flipping from vehicle to vehicle. Shot on a partially walled-in highway specially constructed in San Franciscos East Bay (the Bay Bridge is occasionally visible in the background) the chase is an exhilarating example of action-to-camera staging and stunt choreography as characters assault shoot at and ram one another. In one particularly eye-popping stretch Trinity reverses field on a bike and swerves through oncoming traffic with an inch or two to spare on either side. The only comparable scene in memory is the climactic chase in the second Mad Max film ""The Road Warrior"" although the sheer scale of this new speedfest dwarfs the previous competition. Splitting back onto parallel tracks pic races toward its climax as the machines close in on Zion just as Neo gains entree via the Keymaker to the Architect -- the man who created the Matrix. In this quasi-Lynchian scene set in a chamber lined with video screens displaying moments from his life Neo listens as the old man delivers in exquisitely precise language a disquieting discourse on the subject of human choice and gives a more thorough explanation of the nature of the Matrix universe than has been offered to date. Its a testament to the Wachowskis shrewdness that for such a spotlighted role they cast an unknown Helmut Bakaitis who is as impressive as a more conventionally cast Ian McKellen or Patrick Stewart might have been. Pic ends abruptly with a tantalizing ""To Be Concluded"" tag and true fans will want to stick around through the nine minutes of credits for the action-packed one-minute preview of ""Revolutions"" at the end. Boasting far more visual effects than did the original ""Reloaded"" understandably looks more effects-based which is one aspect that makes it resemble other genre entries more than the first film did. The effort to outdo the original is also palpable sometimes to diminishing returns -- just as the straightening of the narrative and the filling in of information lessen the pics mystery. Films combination of stylishness seriousness of purpose and visceral impact makes it compulsively watchable. Obviously planned with meticulous care in all departments pic sees the return of all hands who made the original such a visual and aural extravaganza notably cinematographer Bill Pope production designer Owen Paterson costume designer Kym Barrett editor Zach Staenberg visual effects supervisor John Gaeta fight choreographer Yuen Wo Ping (abetted by Dion Lam) composer Don Davis and sound designer Dane A. Davis. Even more than before the cast impresses. Reeves confidence seems to have grown along with Neos making him a pleasure to watch. Fishburnes Morpheus has powerfully evolved into more of a spiritual leader with absolute faith in destiny as he sees it while Moss Trinity by contrast has acquired a new vulnerability based on her love for Neo and her fear of losing that love. Weaving gives the multiple Smiths every line a delectably insinuating tone. Harry Lennix registers strongly in his role as a Zion military commander at odds with Morpheus professionally and personally Jada Pinkett Smiths Niobe having come between them. Harold Perrineaus Link remains virtually glued to his keyboard as he lives up to his name as the conduit among the various human factions while Foster Wilson Bellucci and Kim shine in their centerstage moments.
