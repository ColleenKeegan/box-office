After free-spirited Emily (Amanda Peet) introduces smitten stranger Olly (Ashton Kutcher) to the Mile High Club their paths cross several times over the next seven years. Gradually softening Emily becomes increasingly persuaded of Ollys puppy-dog charms but fate continually intervenes to keep them apart. Will they discover that their occasional relationship is a lot like love?Like When Harry Met Sally and Sleepless in Seattle much of this films pleasure rests on the predictability of its ending and its none the worse for it. It benefits too from likeable leads who show far more chemistry with each other than they have with previous co-stars. Rarely however is it laugh-out-loud funny opting for cute physical repartee instead of sharp one-liners (shoving things up their noses to amuse each other spending an entire dinner in silence for a bet). Sweet but never hilarious. Characters such as Ollys deaf brother recall Four Weddings and a Funeral and despite its setting this shares that films playful peculiarly British spirit. But theres little drama to involve competing relationships are merely hinted at and theres no jeopardy or suspense unless you somehow fail to see a traditional comedy twist coming. Still A Lot Like Love tumbles along pleasantly enough endowing its characters with relatable situations and likeable awkwardness.

Starring Amanda Peet and Ashton Kutcher. Directed by Nigel Cole. (PG-13. 97 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Romantic comedies have become way too chaste to satisfy those of us who grew up watching couples uninhibitedly couple on the big screen sometimes before even being properly introduced. So it seems like old times when strangers mate midair in the privy of a plane in ""A Lot Like Love"" -- a romantic tale with a lot going for it besides an acknowledgment that carnal knowledge hasnt altogether slipped the minds of the younger generation. An unfortunate casting decision however comes close to sabotaging a witty script with fresh insights into the trend of young people postponing marriage while waiting for some grand plan of theirs to materialize. It can be a long wait evidenced by those acrobatic lovers Oliver and Emily. That first tryst initiated by Emily to prove she still has it after a boyfriend breaks up with her results in an on-again off-again affair lasting the next seven years. As the sometimes couple Ashton Kutcher and Amanda Peet are together in almost every scene making it difficult to conceal the huge gap in their acting skills. Bland and with a small television face (words once used to describe David Caruso but equally applicable here) Kutcher is incapable of doing the heavy lifting required to be a romantic lead. If he and Peet were performing a pas de deux she would wind up in the hospital with multiple fractures. Peet who has the looks and magnetism of a Kennedy offspring makes Kutcher fade into the background and youre left fantasizing what the movie might have been if Peter Sarsgaard had co-starred. Still the movie is rich in the kind of details often left out because of a lack of budget or imagination. Emily and Oliver have fully fleshed out lives including parents siblings and career aspirations. Much is revealed about Emily when she visits the grave of her mother who the tombstone shows died at 37. With a brisk brushing away of tears Peet conveys the lasting impact of this loss. The vagaries of the dot-com world are pretty accurately portrayed through Olivers entrepreneurial attempt to sell diapers on the Internet. He tries to make a go of it in San Francisco naturally although none of the movie was shot here. Oliver sounds as if hes barely out of diapers himself during a halting presentation to a group of venture capitalists. Nonetheless his company is awarded 6 million; a year later it goes bust. This puts a crimp in the life plan he describes in great detail to Emily. They talk like real people thanks to the good ear of screenwriter Colin Patrick Lynch. Even Kutcher can handle the charmingly silly moments concocted to show that Emily and Oliver are kindred spirits. Their spitting match in a Japanese restaurant is a lot funnier than it sounds. ""Love"" strains credibility though with a multitude of coincidences that hook the pair up again after they have parted ways such as his wandering by a gallery exhibiting her photos including a naked one of them snapped years earlier. An array of secondary characters never quite comes alive especially those who temporarily claim Oliver and Emilys affections but obviously arent right for them. British director Nigel Cole who proved he could handle comedy in ""Saving Grace"" and ""Calendar Girls"" keeps ""Love"" clipping along. He makes such effective use of New York and Los Angeles showcasing parts rarely captured onscreen that you wish he had ventured all the way to San Francisco. -- Advisory This film contains mildly suggestive sexual scenes.

"Lot Like Love A | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; lot-like-love-a ) Lot Like Love A (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli Heres a pleasant little romantic comedy that doesnt try too hard and has the virtue of doing a few things differently. Not that it breaks new ground but there is a little more substance to the story than boy-meets-girl/boy-loses-girl/boy-gets-girl-back. A Lot Like Love features B-list stars Ashton Kutcher and Amanda Peet and while the chemistry between these two doesnt set the celluloid on fire there are enough fitful sparks to get us rooting for them to end up together which is the key foundation to the success of any romance. Actually calling A Lot Like Love a ""romantic comedy"" may be mislabeling it. While the film is undeniably a romance its almost too serious to be considered a ""comedy."" There are occasional bits of humor but some of them are so forced that they seem to have been inserted into an otherwise straight motion picture to lighten the mood. In fact there are times when the tone of A Lot Like Love could almost be considered grim. This is a less fluffy motion picture than we have become accustomed to from entries into this genre. The story starts ""seven years ago"" with recent college graduate Oliver Geary (Kutcher) locking eyes with Emily Friehl (Peet) in Los Angeles International Airport as they are both waiting to board a plane bound for New York. Midway through the flight Emily barges into the lavatory while Oliver is cleaning a stain off his shirt and wordlessly they join the mile-high club. After landing they spend the better part of a day together in the Big Apple then part. Just in case she ever wants to get in touch Oliver gives her his parents phone number. (He figures that although he may end up moving his parents will stay in the same place.) Three years later Emily finds the number and calls it. Its New Years Eve and shes desperate for a date after being dumped by her boyfriend. When Oliver walks into her apartment the spark is still there but it nevertheless takes four more years and several additional encounters before the two characters recognize what the audience knows from the first reel. A Lot Like Love tests the maxim of whether true love is meant to be. Fate or something a lot like it keeps bringing Oliver and Emily together. For each encounter one or both of them is unready to make a commitment. Yet its clear even to them that they connect better with one another than with the other possible ""candidates"" in their lives. Although theres an underlying current of melancholy in some of the scenes director Nigel Cole keeps the tone from becoming too maudlin. And A Lot Like Love doesnt demand the kinds of intervention by chance that formed the backbone of Peter Chelsoms Serendipity. This is probably Ashton Kutchers most impressive screen performance to-date but its still far from a rousing success. The heartthrob avoids catastrophic missteps but his performance lacks energy. Much of the zest in the dynamic between the leads is supplied by Amanda Peet who is doing the best she can to help us forget that she appeared in The Whole Ten Yards. The supporting cast is comprised of a number of vaguely familiar faces (Ali Larter Jeremy Sisto) who fill the necessary ""best friend"" type roles. After all when forces beyond their control keep pulling the protagonists apart so they cant talk to each other there has to be someone they can confide in. Its easy to be cynical about a film like this especially when you see the number of starry-eyed romantic comedies that I do. But A Lot Like Love has enough sincerity that its not easily dismissed as just another attempt to plunder a lucrative market. And by not going too far overboard into drama it avoids becoming cloying and artificial. I like the movie and the way the story progresses. And though it doesnt teach any life lessons (nor does it seek to) it may remind those who see it of the simple truth that its the unplanned things in life that are often the most rewarding.

And in restaurants when no ones looking you enjoy spitting water on each other. You also think its funny when this person sticks straws up his/her nostrils in public a la Jerry Lewis old walrus bit. After they meet and have an encounter in an airplane bathroom Ashton Kutcher tells Amanda Peet to get back in touch with him when hes a success. Disney But enough of this Charles and Camilla stuff. The main thesis of A Lot Like Love is that no matter who you are you will permanently get together no matter how long the journey takes. Which makes this better-than-expected date movie the first comedy in which ""thesis"" and ""Ashton Kutcher"" can be used in the same sentence. (Related video Watch the trailer for A Lot Like Love) Amanda Peets vitality (forget The Whole Nine Yards; her eyes are the whole hundred yards) is the movies driving force. But in-sync Kutcher meets her halfway to conjure nimble comic rhythms in this story of two stumbling-through-life types who cross paths every few years. And no matter how contrived illogical or derivative Love is (see Serendipity and When Harry Met Sally ...) a romantic comedy in which the leads click is three-fourths of the way home. In a jaded contemporary update of what 30s screenwriters used to call ""meeting cute"" Peets chain-smoking free spirit (she drinks shooters in the afternoon too) seduces recent college grad Kutcher in a jetliners lavatory. The two then hang out on a New York afternoon (think Before Sunrise minus the intellectual dimension) before he gives her his L.A.-based parents phone number. Kutchers parting challenge Contact me wherever I am in seven years when Ill have become a corporate success. About the movie A Lot Like Love    (out of four) Stars Ashton Kutcher Amanda Peet Taryn Manning Aimee Garcia Lee Garlington Director Nigel Cole Distributor Touchstone Rated PG-13 for sexual content nudity and language Opens Friday nationwide But she calls sooner (which sets up periodic reunions) and you sense a theme falling into place. But though the movie is prototypical and calculated it isnt exactly fluff and is actually mostly dark. Much of it is about failure -- personal and professional -- and its especially compelling to watch the wind sink out of Peets sails little by little. The chuckles here come from the leads interplay crying on each others shoulders and cheering each other up. Loves life is in its leads and some fairly crisp pacing -- at least until director Nigel Cole (of Brenda Blethyns cute cannabis comedy Saving Grace) lets it go on a few beats too long. Until then its several cuts above its ilk. Its not quite any old movie when Kutchers trademark ""what me worry?"" persona is mined to uncommonly solid effect -- and you also think that his character just might cut it as an off-center entrepreneur.

"Not a Lot to Love washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Not a Lot to Love Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday April 22 2005 ""A LOT LIKE LOVE"" starts with a bang and ends with a whimper. Actually I believe the precise term for the brief anonymous sexual encounter set in an airplane bathroom that opens the film is or at least used to be a ""quickie."" But that probably dates me as someone born before 1970 -- in other words not this movies target demographic. Nowadays its probably called a ""hookup."" Whatever. One minute recent college grad Oliver (Ashton Kutcher) is minding his own business on his way to New York to visit his law-student brother (Ty Giordano) the next hes being sexually assaulted in a public toilet by a beautiful young stranger (Amanda Peet) on the rebound from a broken relationship. If that isnt love or something a lot like it I dont know what is. Apparently Oliver doesnt get out much. You see once the plane lands he seems so grateful for having had the rare opportunity to have sex with anyone that he starts pursuing Emily as he subsequently learns his new friend is called with the goofy affection of a cocker spaniel puppy that has just been rescued by PETA from an animal experimentation lab. This despite the fact that he seems to be the worlds sweetest most sensitive guy (with a deaf brother for gorshs sake whom Oliver treats just like anybody else) and shes a -- how did Barbara Bush once put this? -- ""rhymes with witch."" Thats right. Emily is rude narcissistic distant manipulative a smoker and a drunk. Oh but shes sooo hot. Did I mention she was played by Amanda Peet? Purrrrr. After a day spent together during which Emily exhibits behavior thats supposed to be quirky n feisty but that in the real world would send most men running in the opposite direction Oliver gives Emily his number with an open invitation to call him in a few years when his online diaper business has taken off. Naturally the movie flashes forward a few years then another few and another few as Emily and Oliver serendipitously meet again and again each time prevented by geography careers or other romantic entanglements from realizing or acting on the fact that theyre meant for each other. And how do I know that they are? Because it says so in the press kit. That and the fact that Kutcher and Peet are kissing like lovebirds in the photo-booth pictures that decorate the movie poster. Hey I do my homework. ""A Lot Like Love"" may not be the most egregious example of a foregone romantic conclusion Ive ever seen but there aint exactly a whole lot of suspense at work here either. What kept me awake though was not the question of whether Oliver and Emily would end up together -- do ya think? -- but whether Kutcher and Peet could possibly get any cuter without exploding. (And yes Emily does lose the tude as time goes by.) I wanted so badly to hate ""A Lot Like Love"" but much like Oliver my critical faculties were disabled in my case not by one but two pretty faces. A lot like love? Hardly. Would you believe maybe a little like mild indifference? A LOT LIKE LOVE (PG-13 97 minutes) -- Contains mild obscenity moonlit nudity and sexual references. Area theaters.

Pics happiest ending should be as a rental although favorable word of mouth could yield some surprise box office bounty. Ashton Kutchers second romantic comedy of the spring is far more appealing than ""Guess Who"" -- and pairs him with a beguiling Amanda Peet -- but its also more difficult to market featuring a nondescript premise and almost languid pace. In essence British director Nigel Cole has brought a breezy arthouse sensibility to this tale of fated love which proves pleasant company but doesnt offer a lot of flourishes to highlight in a 30-second TV spot. As such pics happiest ending should be as a rental although favorable word of mouth could yield some surprise box office bounty. The movies structural conceit is intriguing but also episodic enough to be somewhat confining. Beginning ""seven years ago"" we meet just-graduated Oliver (Kutcher) and Emily (Peet) when she impulsively inducts him into the mile-high club. The two spend an afternoon together but his interest in extending the relationship is cut short when Emily warns him that to pursue things further would ""ruin it."" Three years later hes pursuing his entrepreneurial dreams when Emily rings him up in search of a New Years Eve date after being dumped by a boyfriend. The relationship thus continues to unfold in one- or two-year intervals each time finding them at different places in their lives counting down to a present that one neednt have seen ""When Harry Met Sally"" to anticipate. Yet as familiar as that sounds and mostly feels Cole (""Calendar Girls"") milks considerable charm and unforced laughs from his leads whose natural performances and easy rapport make for a hard-to-resist combination. ""You and I will never become a thing"" a punked-out Emily tells Oliver after their first tryst and if its pretty obvious thats untrue its still rather fun watching them make it so. It would help no doubt if the well-cast supporting players registered more strongly but at its core this is a two-character piece and Colin Patrick Lynchs screenplay labors a bit to keep the two apart if only to keep putting them back together. That includes encounters in New York and Los Angeles as well as Olivers stint launching a dot-com in San Francisco the underlying thread being whether he can incorporate love into his carefully plotted ambitions. Nevertheless theres a gentle quality to the film thats too rare these days -- a tone aided immeasurably by Alex Wurmans score and a fine song soundtrack. Emily and Olivers impromptu rendition of Chicagos ""If You Leave Me Now"" in fact yields one of the movies brighter moments -- one of two occasions in which Kutcher demonstrates that he should stick to his day job. Granted ""A Lot Like Love"" is a lot like any number of romantic comedies but there should always be room for another good one even if it follows a bassackward and well-beaten path from ""Seven years ago"" to ""Happily ever after.""
