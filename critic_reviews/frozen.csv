BY Joe Neumaier Elizabeth Weitzman DAILY NEWS MOVIE CRITICS Thursday February 4 2010 448 PM District 13 Ultimatum3 starsAction sequel about a rogue cop and his partner. At the Village East (141). R Violence language drugs. In French with subtitles.Heres an odd coincidence The 2004 French thriller ""District 13"" came from Pierre Morel and Luc Besson who also made this weeks ""From Paris With Love."" And ""District 13s"" sequel ""Ultimatum"" happens to be out today too (though directed by Patrick Alessandrin).Which to see? If you want authenticity go for the energetic ""Ultimatum"" which reunites Cyril Raffaelli and David Belle charismatic masters of parkour the French martial arts discipline. Their vigilantes team up once again to help a grim housing project abandoned by the government.Theres little difference between the first and second movies -- both written by Besson -- so the perfunctory story line will feel familiar to fans. But the action and the head-spinning stunts of those agile lead actors will never get old.Elizabeth WeitzmanThe Red Riding Trilogy5 starsCorruption murder and immorality engulf northwest England in the 70s and 80s. Directors Julian Jarrold James Marsh Anand Tucker. At the IFC Center. Three films -- ""1974"" (145) ""1980"" (136) and ""1983"" (144). Not rated Violence sexuality. These three films (adapted from David Peaces novels by different directors) each a singularly gripping work together form a towering and emotionally complex achievement. The first set in 1974 involves a crime reporter (Andrew Garfield) delving into child abductions in Northern England. The second begins in 1980 and details an investigators (Paddy Considine) analysis of the case of the Yorkshire Ripper who terrified the countys West Riding district for half a decade. The last follows an attorney (Mark Addy) in 1983 as he interviews a mentally damaged man convicted of earlier crimes while a cop (David Morrissey) eyes the shadowy connection the police force has to a land developer (Sean Bean). No one in ""The North"" is unaffected as a dozen characters weave through the narrative. Though David Finchers ""Zodiac"" is an easy comparison each ""Red Riding"" film has a different style -- and all contain haunting mesmerizing performances. Simply stunning. Joe NeumaierAjami4 starsViolence infects an Israeli neighborhood. At Film Forum (200). Not rated Violence drugs. In Arabic and Hebrew with subtitles.The work of Scandar Copti and Yaron Shani would be notable under any circumstances given that this their first film was just nominated for an Oscar. That Copti is Palestinian and Shani Jewish simply adds to the weight of their partnership.Ethnic and cultural divisions underline the films tragedies but rarely in expected ways. When a gang member is killed in Jaffa a war of revenge affects everyone around regardless of religion or nationality. District 13 Ultimatum provides a prime example of the French martial arts discipline parkour. (KINO INTERNATIONAL / HO) The editing is a bit confusing and youll have to pay close attention to the many ties that connect -- and destroy -- this community. But dont worry if you miss some details; this is the kind of movie that rewards a second viewing. E.W.Terribly Happy3 starsBleakly comic noir about a strange small town. At the Angelika (130). Not rated Violence. In Danish with subtitles.If youre looking for lighthearted fun move on. The title of this ink-black comedy is entirely ironic. In fact nobody seems remotely pleased about living in South Jutland a Danish village that could exist in David Lynchs subconscious.Most miserable is Robert (Jakob Cedergren) a Copenhagen cop who reluctantly transferred to this odd little town. Outsiders are decidedly unwelcome and its not long before Robert is entangled in dirty deeds and blackmail. Such dark doings wont be for everyone but fans of similarly dry Nordic fare -- like the works of Aki Kaurismaki -- will be happy to have found it. E.W.Frozen1 starThree people fight for their life on a defective ski lift. At 34th St. 14 Village 7 and Empire 25 (133). R Language horror. Writer-director Adam Green tries to do for chills what ""Open Water"" did for the ocean and the upcoming ""Buried"" does for tight spaces. After a bit of character establishment ""Frozen"" plunks a hapless trio (Kevin Zegers Emma Bell Shawn Ashmore) on a ski lift that gets stuck as night falls. No ones around the resorts closed for a week and before long theres frostbite fear and ... wolves (Greens replacement for sharks). ""Frozen"" is good for five minutes of ""What would you do if?"" games. Then its just stiff as a board. J.N.

Comments (2) click to enlarge Frozen Rated R  95 minutes  2010 Three cash-strapped young ski bums (Emma Bell Shawn Ashmore Kevin Zegers) con their way onto the slopes then pay a huge price when a feckless lift operator leaves them dangling before an oncoming blizzard with no hope of rescue until the following weekend. Writer-director Adam Green (Hatchet) was probably hoping to accomplish something on par with Chris Kentiss terrifying Open Water (2003) in which two scuba divers are left for shark bait by inattentive tour guides. But a stuck chairlift just doesnt exert the same primal terror as a roiling sea and to make up the difference Green would need a better cast and sharper dialogue than he has here.

amyweekly >> Blog Archive >> Frozen amyweekly Amy Nicholsons reviews and interviews << The Last Station From Paris With Love >> Frozen Adam Greens sparse drama about three college kids abandoned in a blistering ski lift is a chillingly real look at spur-of-the-moment survival instincts that struggles to fill its feature length running time. Genre prospects are lukewarm for a flick that blazes its own path shunning guts and inglorious deaths (mostly) for a measured moderately effective look at three kids staring down their own doom. Childhood best friends Dan (Kevin Zegers) and Joe (Shawn Ashmore) have set off on a skiing adventure to get away from it all only part of what Joe wants to get away from--Dans tagalong girlfriend Parker (Emma Bell)--is along for the ride. Frustrated after a day spent encouraging her down the bunny slope Joe goads the trio into taking one final tear down a real trail. In a rush of closing time camaraderie they convince the lift operator to allow them to take the last bench up of the night. But human error--a force as deadly and merciless as any serial killer--strands them a bone-breaking height above the hard-packed snow. And the slopes arent reopening for five days. What works in Greens script is the naturalism a new move for the gore-tastic director of Hatchet (hes now working on Hatchet 2) throughout we know nothing more than the doomed trio. We dont know if theres a groundskeeper coming by in the morning. We dont know if the overnight forecast is fatal. We dont know whether to jump or wait. Were caught between likely death and unlikely survival. In those moments when we (and the characters) are paralyzed between bad decisions were as stiff with tension as an icicle. The problem is even though we empathize with their predicament--and it plays out realistically--the threesome is so impractical that were distracted by our own (better) escape routes. But then again who doesnt think they can outsmart a foolhardy frat guy when theyre in a warm theater with a bucket of popcorn? Zegers plays a stock alpha male with attitude yet hes redeemed as the films bravest character. As his girlfriend and hopeful wife-to-be the spunky Bell turns weepy and weak quick but its uncharitable to assume wed be less obnoxious. Ashmores Joe is the least-drawn character; hes clearly got a heart but we never believe that a guy who loves his best friend would pick on his girlfriend mercilessly even when theyre cozy in the ski lodge. And when their numbers are whittled down and the survivors unleash their panic on each other the emotional digressions feel like filler for a thriller struggling to be full length. Give Green credit for not padding it with a second villain--say a bear with attitude--but theres really only enough drama here for a good sixty minute TV special.

Stephen Cole The Globe and Mail Published Friday Feb. 05 2010 1200AM EST Last updated Thursday Feb. 04 2010 154PM EST Comments AA Country USA Language English Frozen Written and directed by Adam Green Starring Emma Bell Kevin Zegers Shawn Ashmore and Kane Hodder Classification 14A Another date movie-horror flick designed to scare tentative couples into each others arms Frozen is the grisly tale of three collegians stranded on a stalled ski chairlift. Its Sunday night. Resort workers have all gone home and arent returning until Friday. Left behind are young couple Dan and Parker along with his best friend Lynch - all of them dangling 60 feet up in wild air. Plot complications Pink ski-jacketed Parker has to go to the bathroom. And hungry wolves are circling below howling for people popsicles. Frozen would get props for a novel plot except that its storyline appears to be ski-lifted from the Curb Your Enthusiasm episode where Larry is stuck on a chairlift with an Orthodox Jewish woman who is terrified of being seen with a man after sunset. The kids in writer-director Adam Greens ( Hatchet) new chiller-thriller have more to worry about than breaking Jewish religious laws to be sure. Pretty Parkers face is sprouting hoarfrost. And Dan and Lynch go mad trying to outfox wolves. Still the film is only occasionally scary fun. For most of its 90 or so minutes Frozen is just that stuck with nothing to do on a chairlift. There are some nasty moments but not enough of the cattle-prod jolts horror fans prize. Nor is Frozen the engaging talkathon it sets out to be. All three kids do a lot of yakking but their meandering conversations never lead to any unexpected hidden drama. And at no time are their lives made more interesting by their mountain misadventure.Filmmaker Green also spends way too much time setting up the premise then playing puppets with his dangling characters. The films big bid-to-escape scene when it finally comes takes up too little time and doesnt involve enough climactic hurdles. The acting by Emma Bell along with Canadians Kevin Zegers ( Transamerica) and Shawn Ashmore ( X-Men) like Frozen itself is merely all right. Then again Parker Dan and Lynch really have little to do.

Although it opens today in theaters the indie chiller is strictly couch-tater fare. Written and directed by Adam Green the film follows three 20-somethings who make the knuckleheaded mistake of scamming one last run at a ski area. When the chairlift stops they are left high above the slopes with no attractive exit. ""Frozen"" begins with handsome Dan (Kevin Zegers) pimping girlfriend Parker (Emma Bell). He and best friend Joe (Shawn Ashmore) watch as pretty blond Parker persuades a burly and bored ski-lift operator to take a bribe for tickets. She succeeds -- or does she? That might be the moral here. They begin a day on the underwhelming slopes of Mount Holliston named for the directors Massachusetts birthplace. Parker is a newbie snowboarder. The fellas are skiers. So Joe is more than a little frustrated with the outings pace. Theres something intriguingly spare about having the three suspended in a chairlift. (How would Samuel Beckett have written this drama?) But the script is clunky the acting strained. Too bad. Underlying the life-and-death thriller are notions about the ways coupledom changes and challenges friendships. Dan and Joe are lifelong buddies. How lasting Dan and Parkers relationship is hasnt been determined yet. Greens previous film ""Hatchet"" (2006) was a slasher comedy set in the Louisiana bayous. So kudos to the young director for taking on something differently frightening. After all who doesnt get weirded out when the ski lifts gondola pauses a little too long? Before absolute fear sets in and tough decisions have to be made the trio chat and spar about smoking the film ""Jaws"" as well as the worst ways to die. Uh-oh. (The sad arcs of those who leapt from the World Trade Center are part of the conversation.) Once it becomes clear how stuck they are they face their own fears of awful demise. Consider ""Frozen"" a wind- chilled ""Open Water"" a 2003 indie that also premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. It was scary and sorrowful. Those same moods were possible here but Green leaves them hanging. ""Frozen"" Written and directed by Adam Green; photography by Will Barratt; starring Kevin Zegers Shawn Ashmore and Emma Bell. Rated R for some disturbing images and language. 94 Minutes. Opens today at area theaters.

What those wolves are doing on the slopes of a fancy New England ski resort is perhaps best known to writer-director Adam Green. He may also be able explain why remarkably none of the three 20-somethings is carrying an electronic communication device of any kind. Green contrives to strand Joe (Shawn Ashmore) Dan (Kevin Zegers) and Dans girlfriend Parker (Emma Bell) 50 feet in the air up the mountain after closing one night with a storm moving in. The sheer mechanics of their situation generates thrills for a while. Then a panicky Dan makes a really really dumb decision. He breaks both his legs and meets up with the aforementioned wolves -- with his exposed bones looking like Sunday brunch. Parker not much smarter falls asleep with an ungloved hand on the metal bar of the lift chair -- and well you probably dont want to eat before seeing this movie. Joe marginally the least dim of these bulbs has another not-so-bright idea. In its concept the film is reminiscent of an earlier Sundance sensation the genuinely terrifying ""Open Water"" which stranded a couple in shark-infested seas. This time though the performances and what passes for dialogue -- mostly extended bickering and screaming -- are so lackluster that its hard to care about the fate of this trio for long. Instead I was far more interested in how Will Barrett the talented cinematographer of ""Frozen"" got such great moving shots so high up in the air.

Frozen A chill a minute | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesFrozen A chill a minuteThe biggest frights come softly and without warning. Theyre the mysterious sounds you awaken to in the middle of the night.Emma Bell shows the effects of ignoring ominous warnings not to take one more ski run when a storm is brewing.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Feb. 5 2010 Starring Kevin Zegers Shawn Ashmore and Emma Bell. Directed by Adam Green. 85 minutes. At major theatres. 14A The biggest frights come softly and without warning.Theyre the mysterious sounds you awaken to in the middle of the night. The slow footsteps in a supposedly empty house. The sudden movements in a dark garden.Article Continued BelowTheyre also physical like the chill that slides up your spine as you realize youre stranded on a ski lift high above a vacated mountain. This is the terror scenario for Frozen Adam Greens masterfully minimalist horror.Arriving in theatres immediately after its Sundance premiere its almost a Canadian movie because the two male leads are from Toronto.Dan (Kevin Zegers) Joe (Shawn Ashmore) and Parker (American Emma Bell) are three pals looking for cheap thrills. Theyve managed to scam one last run down a ski mountain from a lift operator who is anxious to get home.The operator warns them that bad weather and nightfall are both closing in and the mountain must be shuttered until the following weekend. Dan Joe and Parker promise theyll be right up and down. Things dont go as planned and thats putting it mildly. Not much more of the plot can be revealed except to say that theres perhaps no more lonely spot on Earth than being attached to a slender wire high above a dark mountain.And what is that sound off in the distance? What is it and is it getting any closer?Taking a dramatic turn from the slasher hilarity of his breakthrough feature Hatchet writer/director Green plays it straight with a script that has the virtue of simplicity.We are given a few minutes to get to know Dan and Parker who are boyfriend and girlfriend and Joe who feels like a fifth wheel. Dan is bossy Parker is coy and Joe is a little moody.Then its straight up that mountain where time stands still. Not for the viewer who will have reason to think of Open Water and Jaws before the final credits roll. The tension is almost unbearable. One actor loses a glove and it registers like a grenade strike. But hypothermia isnt the most immediate threat facing the three stranded skiers.Frozen reminds us that you dont need much to make a good scary movie. Just a strong story good actors and an abiding sense of how things dangle in the dark.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

For the answer just meander--no need for running or walking--to your local multiplex. Thats where ""Dear John"" based on the Nicholas Sparks novel of the same name will be meandering on its downward path from sweetly tender to terminally turgid. ENLARGE Amanda Seyfried as Savannah in Dear John. Sony Pictures The story begins in the spring of 2001 when a hunky boy meets a golden girl on a picturesque pier sticking out from the South Carolina coast into the Atlantic Ocean. His name is--exactly right--and hes played by the model-turned-actor Channing Tatum. Her name is Savannah--though she comes from Charleston--and Amanda Seyfried plays her as a perfect empath; Savannah reacts with love and understanding to the tiniest twitch of the muscles on his handsome face. This is good because John a special-forces soldier home on leave is not what youd call voluble. In the Nicholas Sparks tradition hes an old-fashioned American archetype strong and silent and combative only in self-defense. But thats good too because the director Lasse Hallstrom working from a screenplay by Jamie Linden treats the lovers first encounters in an enjoyably old-fashioned way with palpable affection and not a trace of irony. Its as if these scenes had been lifted from a World War II love story. He must go back to his unit she must go back to school and they both must be patient until his tour of duty ends in only a year. But 9/11 intervenes John responds to the terrorist attack by re-upping and their love must now be sustained by mail. This is good and not so good. The downside is obvious. Epistolary romance in the movies means listening to letters in voice-over rather than studying live flesh in close-up. The upside is Mr. Sparkss abiding belief in the power of the written word--he wrote ""The Notebook"" which made a really fine movie as well as ""Message in a Bottle."" This film goes so far as to explain in a helpful montage set almost a decade ago exactly how snail mail works You put your envelope in a mailbox--or give it to a fellow soldier--the envelope goes to a post office a machine sorts it and then sends it on its way to the addressee. Whats not good at all is how the story loses energy and interest when Savannah is off screen and John is slogging his way through several low-rent combat sequences. They get together again of course; Mr. Sparks is a specialist in poignant reunions. But Johns prolonged absence has made the course of true love disagreeably bumpy and the perplexities of the hero and heroine are compounded by the limitations of the performances. Though Ms. Seyfried is a lovely actress her inexperience shows in her climactic scenes which arent written very well to begin with while Mr. Tatums stolid reserve decays into dull passivity. A wealth of experience allows Richard Jenkins to transcend the limitations of his role as Johns severely repressed but loving father an obsessive coin collector who manifests symptoms of Aspergers Syndrome. Hes not alone in his struggle to prevail over adversity. Other characters must deal with autism and lymphoma in a movie that suffers from Convenient Disease Syndrome. ENLARGE John Travolta is the CIA agent Charlie Wax in From Paris With Love. Lionsgate From Paris With Love Be forewarned that the title of ""From Paris With Love"" is ironic. Weapons are the only love objects in this action-comedy of chaos (long on the chaotic action short on the comedy). John Travolta is Charlie Wax a loose cannon--and later a loose bazooka--whos a special agent of the CIA. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is James Reese a low-level CIA operative who works out of the American embassy in Paris. James lives a peaceful Parisian life with a beautiful French girlfriend until Charlie bursts upon the scene and makes him a reluctant sidekick. The pretext for the mayhem that ensues is a terrorist plot but the movie is really about pressing Mr. Travolta who does show up for the damnedest paydays into yet another of those gleefully manic roles (increasingly long on the manic and short on the glee) that he did so brilliantly in ""Pulp Fiction."" The director Pierre Morel (he did the hugely popular ""Taken"") stages most of the action at a breakneck--and breakbrain--pace while poking ponderous fun at the conventions of the action-adventure genre. (The script such as it is was written by Adi Hasak.) At one point cocaine rains from the punctured ceiling of a Chinese restaurant. At another dead bodies rain from the top of a spiral staircase. One strenuously extended shootout in a mannequin factory does double duty as an homage to Stanley Kubricks ""Killers Kiss."" Still the action is ponderous too. Mr. Morel is no Kubrick or Tarantino just as Mr. Travoltas caricature of John Travolta is no Travolta. ENLARGE Emma Bell plays Parker in Frozen. Anchor Bay Films Frozen Adam Greens ""Frozen"" explores a tiny idea exhaustively and I mean exhaustively. Three young snowboarders--two guys and a girl--manage to get stranded on a chair lift overnight though it could be longer. No one knows theyre there dangling high above the snow with no way to get down and the lift will be closed until the following weekend. Will they survive the bitter cold plus other perils that the mountain has in store? More to the point will we survive the tedium of watching a trio of frightened kids who say things like ""This is so messed up"" and ""This is so retarded""? In fact Mr. Green a director of low-budget horror flicks has found more for them to talk about--memories of grammar school regrets about dating the worst ways to die. And the terrified trio played by Kevin Zegers Shawn Ashmore and Emma Bell find more to do than dangle. But theyre much less compelling than the wolves that lurk below them. Wolves may also have regrets about their dating choices but they keep them to themselves. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com DVD Focus ENLARGE The Letter (1940) If you accept the summary verdict of Netflix which fortunately makes the film available this drama ""stars Bette Davis in one of her nastiest roles."" Its much more interesting than that though and one of Daviss best roles. She plays Leslie Crosbie the wife of a rubber-plantation owner in Singapore. Leslie shoots a man to death and claims she did it in self-defense but a letter in her own hand threatens to prove otherwise. William Wyler directed from a script that Howard Koch adapted from a Somerset Maugham play. With James Stephenson Herbert Marshall Frieda Inescort and Gale Sondergaard. ENLARGE A Letter to Three Wives (1949) Joseph L. Mankiewicz won a pair of Oscars for writing as well as directing this satirical comedy in which three married women on vacation from suburbia receive a letter from Addie Ross the town seductress who claims that shes running off with one of their husbands. Which one? To answer that question each of the wives examines or exhumes her marriage. Theyre played by Jeanne Crain Linda Darnell and Ann Sothern. The supporting cast includes Paul Douglas whos sensational; Kirk Douglas Florence Bates Connie Gilchrist and Thelma Ritter. An uncredited Celeste Holm provides Addie Rosss voice. ENLARGE Letters From Iwo Jima (2006) In one sense Clint Eastwoods film is a companion piece to his ""Flags of Our Fathers"" which dramatized Americas horrifically costly battle for the small Pacific island in World War II It chronicles the battle in Japanese with English subtitles from the Japanese point of view. In a larger sense its the second and artistically superior half of a single epic film that springs from a single act of compassionate imagination--depicting the Japanese soldiers not as anonymous Others but as men who might be but for their faces and uniforms the GIs and officers of American war movies. --Joe Morgenstern Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Floating Food Forest Arrives in New York City RNC vs. DNC Sizing Up the Conventions Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Opinion Hillarys One-Candidate Race Opinion A Disunited Partys Successful Convention GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% The Olympic Fantasy Confronts Reality Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Both are low-budget lo-fi indie fright fests in which actors youve never heard of are placed in claustrophobic jeopardy. Movie Information FrozenRatingShowtimes | Official site | TrailerDirector Adam GreenActors Emma Bell Shawn Ashmore and Kevin ZegersRun time 93 minutesMPAA rating R (disturbing images strong language)Synopsis A trio of friends are stranded in a ski lift.More movies from GuideLive.comWhereas Paranormal Activity pulsated with the dread of the supernatural Frozens fears are rooted in the seemingly mundane reality of nature inexorably taking its course. In that sense the intermittently suspenseful Frozen is closer in spirit to the terrifyingly haunting 2003 film Open Water (a couple marooned in the middle of the ocean) and the far less successful stuck-in-the-middle -of-nowhere movie from last year The Canyon (a couple marooned at the bottom of the Grand Canyon).But in Frozen instead of the sea or the desert its the mountains. A 20-something couple and a best friend are stranded in subfreezing temperatures on a ski lift with no cellphones at closing time on a Sunday with bad weather moving in. And the weekends-only resort wont open again for five more days.Until that point jocular Dan (Steve Zegers) girlfriend Parker (Emma Bell) and Dans considerably shyer best-friend-for-life Joe (Shawn Ashmore) had been having a good time - even if Joe was a little put out that Parker was putting a wedge in the guys friendship.But those relationships are tested when the three of them realize that they might die together suspended high above a snowy wilderness. At its best Frozen taps into the fear of heights and of isolation of the mounting anxiety that comes with knowing that death will be slow and painful.Yet Frozen doesnt ratchet up the tension in the way that Open Water does. The acting isnt always convincing and director-writer Adam Green who developed a bit of a cult following for his 2006 horror film Hatchet takes his time getting the trio in the chair. Even then he will back off just when you expect him to go full-throttle.Still the threesomes constant conversation amid the building unease helps establish them as characters with which the audience can identify. By the end its almost impossible not to get pulled into their plight.Some might be disappointed that theres nothing high-tech here. Its basically three people a mountain the weather and a few wolves. (Who by the way are much better actors than their lupine brethren in The Canyon. Just sayin.)And dont expect this indie-film obsession with dying alone in an isolated spot to go away anytime soon. One of the most talked-about films to come out of Sundance this year is Buried in which Ryan Reynolds tries to escape from a coffin for the entire movie. It almost makes being stuck in a dangling chairlift seem not so bad. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Is there a fundamental pleasure in watching beautiful but vapid people undergo complete physical destruction? Probably or horror stories like ski-trip-gone-bad ""Frozen"" (produced by Peter Block of ""Saw"" fame) wouldnt exist. In this case the characters are shiny clean college kids bundled in the latest styles from North Face and PacSun antsy from sexual tension and ready to hit the slopes. Dan and Parker (Kevin Zegers of ""Transamerica"" and Emma Bell of ""Dollhouse"") are a couple just entering the ""calling each other honey"" stage and Joe (Shawn Ashmore of ""X-Men"") is the pouty third wheel. The three set off on a ski trip that conveniently for the horror plot they failed to mention to anyone else. We appear headed for a regurgitation of ""American Pie""-like foibles complete with a bland frat-house rock score. Incessant chatter makes the cast of this gory thriller sound like nervous kids trying to talk to adults. The excess of conversation never succeeds at humor but it does make us hate the characters whose speech seems to have just two modes bickering and whining. After a day on the bunny hill the group persuades the lift operator to let them take one last ride on the big chairlift at dusk only to be forgotten in the employees rush to get home. After the fateful lift comes to a halt the tone of the film changes signaled when a screeching string section replaces the rock score. While director Adam Green so far has tortured us with a terrible movie he now begins the gruesome torture of his own characters. As frostbite hits Parkers freckled complexion slowly appears dipped in wax and flecked with odd bits of color. Dan suffers not one but two broken legs. The destruction of the college students blandly perfect exteriors is at least somewhat satisfying. Worse things start to happen wolves starvation excessive skin loss due to contact with frigid metal. Can I open my eyes now? At this point holes in the plot begin to nag more insistently. Why wouldnt these kids have their cell phones at the ready? Couldnt they just make a rope out of their coats and climb down? FROZEN  1/2 out of 4 stars. Rated R for disturbing images and language. Suspending my disbelief in this case only brings mild nausea and none of the compensating pleasures of imagined landscapes or special effects. Heres hoping that the producer wont somehow turn ""Frozen"" into its own six-film franchise as has happened with ""Saw."" ""Suspended"" the tale of three abandoned rock climbers dangling over grizzly bears does not need to exist.

Realistically what could happen to this trio dangling in midair? Will they be attacked by ravenous pterodactyls?All they can do is sit there getting colder and colder as they realize help isnt coming. That folks is the plot of Frozen. In its entirety.Where are the flying Saint Bernards when you really need them?Three attractive twentysomethings (Shawn Ashmore Emma Bell and Kevin Zegers) have the accursed misfortune of trying to sneak in one last downhill run before a Boston area resort closes for the week. (Really? A ski resort open only on weekends during the winter?)Sunrise sunset. Sunrise sunset. Slowly creep the days. In fact Frozen moves so glacially you could swear it was shot in real time.The last words Zegers says before boarding the chair are ""Well be like wicked fast."" Oh cruel irony.Dont any of them have a cell phone stashed in one of the 30 or so pockets on their parkas? Apparently not. Couldnt they jump to the ground? Sure they consider it but its an awfully big drop.About all they can do is sit there making inane chitchat to distract themselves - that is when theyre not squabbling and pointing gloves at one another. Hurry hypothermiaHow could a film set in the great outdoors feel so claustrophobic? Three people trapped in an elevator would be more exciting.Obviously you need to add some agent of suspense. Otherwise youre simply waiting for frostbite to set in. And Frozen devises a real doozy. Who knew the woods near Framingham were so savage?Director and writer Adam Green was aiming for a low-budget thriller in the vein of Paranormal Activity. What he created is about one short click away from a bad Saturday Night Live sketch.This may be the only scary movie ever made in which you end up rooting against the innocents.If you actually sit through this enervating ordeal youll swear that time is Frozen.Contact staff writer David Hiltbrand at 215-854-4552 or dhiltbrandphillynews.com.

Im waiting for ""Restaurant about a couple marooned for weeks at a table by the bathrooms the waitstaff nowhere in sight.""Frozen has its work cut out for it since the main characters are so annoying you initially pray for an avalanche to just get it over with. Dan (Kevin Zegers) is a smarmy prep who pimps out his girlfriend to flirt with a ski-lift operator for free passes; said girlfriend Parker (Emma Bell) is a whiner who has been falling down the bunny slope all day. Dans best friend Lynch (Shawn Ashmore) is a slacker ski purist who sneers at the other twos snowboards. Check please?Yet writer-director Green (a Holliston native now living in LA) generally plays fair by the premise with one or two big honking exceptions; see below. ""Frozen is an effective no-frills gruel-a-thon if thats your cup of Swiss Miss and it explores such burning questions as What happens if youre dumb enough to leave your bare hand on a metal safety bar overnight? What does frostbite look like if you scratch it? Is it possible to shimmy along a lift cable without severing your fingers? And - a crucial one - when did wolves come back to New England?""Frozen was shot in Utah but its definitely set in our neck of the woods - Wachusett gets a call-out - and it shares with the much more inept ""The Canyon the ecological novelty of wolves where there aint none. I suppose if you can suspend your disbelief the way the heroes are suspended over the abyss strands of cable ping-pinging apart one by one you can accept the suspense of their possibly becoming doggie dinner. Harder to buy is the fact that none of the three are packing a cellphone. When screenplay necessity trumps logical realism you have a problem.So yes ""Frozen is silly stuff but I admire Green for seeing the situation through and ultimately coming down to the nerve-racking spectacle of two stressed people going into their third day aloft in sub-zero temperatures. No green screen no special effects; just a little fake blood and a few stunt wolves that look like their trainer tops them up once a day with New York strip.

Three college students--Shawn Ashmore his best friend Kevin Zegers and Zegers girlfriend Emma Bell--take an impromptu ski trip and through a chain of unfortunate circumstances largely caused by their own obstinacy and sense of privilege they wind up stranded on a ski lift at a resort thats going to be closed for the next five days. The kids have no cell phones theyre too high up to jump the ski-lift wire is too sharp to grab and the woods are full of dangerous critters. What resources can they draw on to stay alive and/or get themselves rescued? Thats a great question for any thriller to ask--especially one that confines its action more or less to a single location. The fun of movies like Frozen is in thinking along with the protagonists and letting our own survival instincts kick in from the safety of our chairs. But the problem with movies like Frozen is that since we know the movie is 90 minutes long--and we know our trio wont be rescued right away--a lot of the movies ""Hey lets give this a try"" scenes lack a necessary tension. The plans need to be a lot cleverer (and more frequent) than they are here. The other problem with Frozen? While the actors are game their characters are awfully generic. Ashmore is a standard ""bro"" Zegers is whipped and defensive and Bell is alternately cute and bitchy. While the threesome are busy not coming up with cool ways to escape were treated to long scenes of them sitting in the cold and talking about what its like to be a stereotype. Beyond those stiff tedious moments Frozen does take a few unexpected turns. Green definitely knows his way around a suspense sequence but he needs to find a way to work those sequences into a movie that has its own organic life and isnt so... well please refer back to the title.

Frozen is a brilliantly conceived gut-wrenching horror film about three vital healthy appealing and attractive skiers whose perfect snow day turns into a nightmare when they get stranded on the chair lift after dark. This is every skiers worst fear and the talented writer-director Adam Green gives it life in ways that will leave you impacted long after the 94 minutes of unrelenting suspense have ended. Calm and jaded as I am I was left so paralyzed with terror by this movie that I chewed a whole pencil in half watching it. Everyone who has ever gazed up at a slope pounded with fresh snow wonders what it would be like to get lost 10000 feet in the air on a deserted slope with a blizzard on the way. But the three chums in Frozen dont even get to the slope. Dan his girlfriend Parker and his best friend Joe (Kevin Zegers Emma Bell and Shawn Ashmore) have finally bribed their way onto the ski lift in time for the last run of the day. Night is falling the lights go out the mechanism stops and the mountain wont open again until the following weekend. The staff thinks the final head count has been taken and heads for the parking lot below in snowmobiles. What might ordinarily be an easily solved mechanical problem turns into a worst-case scenario on the level of Open Water the unforgettable horror movie about two scuba divers accidentally left behind in the shark-infested Caribbean. This time the snow takes the place of water but the end result is every bit as pulse-poundingly ghastly. This game trio anxious to escape the chaos of routine by spending some quality time together is resourceful young and physically fit but as the stages of psychological panic progress starvation frostbite and hysteria take their toll. To keep from going crazy they try to pass the time with games (""What is the best-selling cereal of all time?""; ""Name the three celebrities youd most want to do you"") but nothing works. Dan tries to hang on to his slowly fading manhood with words of encouragement (""Were going to get through this O.K.?"") but dropping a glove gripping a frozen pipe that rips the skin off the hand and enduring the howling wind are ordeals for which nobody can prepare. Dan finally leaps 50 feet to the ground below to go for help and breaks his leg in the fall. Just when you think nothing worse can happen along comes a pack of wolves. Its one damn thing after another but I will clam up now. This is one hair-raising adventure guaranteed to keep you frozen yourself. Frozen is the best kind of horror film about innocent people plunged into mind-boggling circumstances beyond their control. I predict instant word-of-mouth success at the box office but its no fad or phenomenon. Made by real pros and having lasting shock value it is miles above and beyond such temporary distractions as The Blair Witch Project (an amateurish fluke it resembles in no way except a shoestring budget) in quality artistry and appeal. Every aspect of the nightmare is captured as realistically as breathing by director Green and his screenplay miraculously finds the time to develop character and build rapport between the excellent actors and the audience. Mr. Green does a masterful job of balancing action in the air with the terrible events on the ground below. The screenplay perfectly captures the way people think and talk under stress and its amazing how much variety there is in the camera work. The whole thing was shot high above the ground in punishing subzero temperatures in a real snowstorm on an actual lift so dangerous it could accommodate only the director and one cameraman. (The actors helped change the camera lenses.) Theres nothing phony here and Mr. Green makes every micro-second count. The result is a maximum of terror without a single computer-generated image or fake special effect. Frozen is the kind of must-see horror film I can only equate with coming face to face in the garden with a hungry crocodile. rreedobserver.com Comment Filed under Adam Green Emma Bell Kevin Zegers Movie Review On the Town Shawn Ashmore Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture The Man Who Made Blue Oyster Cult RIP Producer Sandy Pearlman Culture The (Real) Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia Origin Story Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP",http://www.observer.com/2010/culture/high-wire-act,200,frozen15,frozen,observer

Well now you can feel it all over again in Frozen writer-director Adam Greens frostbitten nightmare of neglect on a New England ski lift. Generic college buddies Dan (Kevin Zegers) and Joe (Shawn Ashmore who ironically played Iceman in the X-Men franchise) meet up for their annual snowboarding jaunt the depths of their dynamic revealed as passive-aggressive Joe feels like the third wheel to Dans girlfriend Parker (Emma Bell) who tagged along. A blizzard is on its way and the resort has started closing down so what harm could there be in riding up to the mountain one last time? Green (director of Hatchet and the upcoming Hatchet 2) has stumbled onto a nifty variant of a genre paradigm but just like most American horror films today Frozen proves more gory than scary--the worst of this trios problems isnt heights hunger or thirst but a bloodthirsty pack of wolves licking their lips down below. Green also cant maintain the suspension of disbelief necessary as we watch three charmlessly written characters bicker and attempt inane ideas. Its one thing to be scared with them and quite another to feel trapped with them.

Like ""Open Water"" on a ski lift ""Frozen"" takes one of those horrifying ""what if"" scenarios (in this case what if you got stuck on a chairlift and left dangling halfway up the slope for days) and stretches that slender concept to 90 minutes. Though better suited to a shorter format ""Frozen"" turns on a universal-enough fear to attract the curious if only to see where writer-director Adam Green could take the idea. Strangely he doesnt seem much interested in vertigo (the camera rarely looks down) deriving most of the films squirm-inducing tension from the weather abandonment and wolves. Yes wolves. Dont ask what theyre doing on the slopes of a fancy resort. Its a cheat but Green knows waiting for his characters to die of exposure isnt nearly as scary if theres not something with sharp teeth and an insatiable appetite circling below (""Open Water"" had sharks after all). In order to justify ""Frozens"" feature length Green pads the opening with 20 minutes of his three central characters skiing and scamming. Parker (Emma Bell) thinks soap-star-cute Dan (Kevin Zegers) could be ""the one"" while awkward third wheel Joe (Shawn Ashmore) seems to resent her stealing the attention of his best friend. Dont be surprised if the movies most wince-inducing moments come not from the ""disturbing images"" (as the MPAA describes the sight of a leg bone sticking six inches out of one characters ski pants) but rather of the bad acting and worse dialogue. By the time the trio hop on for one last run were more than ready for fate to take a turn which it does when someone at the bottom turns everything off -- first the lift then the lights. Green insisted upon shooting everything on an actual slope in Utah which explains why the camera angles are nearly all from below or chair-level. Anyone whos ever ridden a lift however knows the passengers have a far more terrifying view and Green is remiss not to play more on the auds fear of heights. Since the plot literally has nowhere to go ""Frozen"" is basically a waiting game. The characters pass the time by arguing (whose fault is it and how long will it take people to realize theyre missing) and revealing how little their deaths will matter. Whether jumping climbing or falling each is going to have to find some way down to where the wolves are and the suspense is greatest when theyre proactively trying to reach the ground. Green loves gore and though he never shows the really grisly stuff onscreen he takes great pleasure in revealing the bloody consequences of bad decisions like falling asleep with your bare hand on the metal bar or rubbing that frostbitten patch on your face. Injuries sound like eating cantaloupe and theres not nearly enough creaking or wind to put auds in the characters shoes. The makeup effects however look so realistic some viewers have gotten physically sick from the experience.
