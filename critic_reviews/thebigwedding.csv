De Niro plays Don a successful sculptor who is persuaded to pretend hes still married to his snippy ex-wife (Keaton) to avoid offending their sons future mother-in-law a strict Catholic. Even if they can pull it off the ruse will seriously piss off Dons current partner Bebe (Sarandon). Not to mention reopen old wounds for the rest of his kids - including workaholic exec Lyla (Katherine Heigl) who is herself on the verge of divorce. Its not the sheer predictability of the ensuing frolics thats hardest to take or even the dismal attempts at humour (cunnilingus stiffies hand-jobs really?) but the sheer misery of watching actors you once respected demean themselves in such utterly worthless fodder.

Ok this isnt great it isnt even good but as far as wedding comedies goes it is not the worst. Yes the characters are walking talking cliches and yes at timesthe humour is very recycled with every subplot being signposted well in advance and they all end up nice and tidily at the end. We have seen it all before but it passes the time. I laughed a little more than I expected and much more than the review would have you think. I wouldnt pay top price for it and if you watch it at anytime other than a bargain matinee or on Wednesday with the 2 for 1 deal you will probably feel short changed.

Comments click to enlarge The Big Wedding Video Rated R  90 minutes  2013 A long-divorced couple (Robert DeNiro Diane Keaton) pretend to be married to help out their adopted son when his biological mother a staunch Catholic attends his wedding. No one quite embarrasses himself in this hackneyed farce adapted from the French comedy Mon Frere se Marie (2006) and the big-name players take obvious pleasure in their occasional good lines. Barring a few off-color jokes though the movie feels like a Carol Burnett sketch dragged out to feature length. Justin Zackham directed his own script; with Susan Sarandon Topher Grace Katherine Heigl Amanda Seyfried and Robin Williams.

"Big Wedding The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; big-wedding-the ) Big Wedding The (United States 2013) April 26 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli Despite being adapted from a generally well-liked French film The Big Wedding feels like nothing more ambitious than a big screen sit-com. Its tired and dated with too few laughs to justify the stultifying attempts at drama and the impossible-to-swallow plot contortions. The justification for the central narrative conceit a divorced couple pretending to still be married is sufficiently absurd to make one question the intelligence of all those involved. Sympathetic characters are few and far between and when one does show up he/she is afforded minimal screen time. The humor in The Big Wedding is sufficient to elevate it from the ""completely unwatchable"" category into the ""disappointingly mediocre"" one. That I suppose is damning with faint praise. There are some amusing one-liners and punch lines that result in half-hearted laughter but those instances dont come frequently enough to camouflage the films numerous obvious deficiencies. The only way for a comedy to work when the screenplay makes no attempt to build emotional connections between audience and characters is for it to offer nonstop hilarity. That doesnt happen here. The Big Weddings attempts at relationship building are embarrassing and the situation isnt helped by a roster of high-profile stars (Robert De Niro Diane Keaton Susan Sarandon Katherine Heigl Amanda Seyfried) going through the motions. The only ones who seem to be trying are Topher Grace and Ben Barnes. Robin Williams has what amounts to a very odd cameo (reminiscent of Rowan Atkinsons turn as a priest in Four Weddings and a Funeral) and Ana Ayoras skinny dipping scene serves as The Big Weddings lone highlight. Like most wedding movies this is all about the behind-the-scenes shenanigans that go on leading up to the big event. Don (De Niro) and Ellie (Keaton) have been divorced for a number of years. Don lives with Bebe (Sarandon) in the palatial (but not overly ostentatious) house he once shared with Ellie. The three havent seen one another since the divorce but they seem chummy enough. Don and Ellie have come together for the wedding of their adopted son Alejandro (Barnes) to his willowy girlfriend Missy (Seyfried). Also on hand are the couples other children Jared (Grace) and Lyla (Heigl). Jared is a 29-year old virgin eager to lose that distinction and Lyla is smarting from the breakup of her marriage. Complications arise as a result of the arrival of Alejandros biological mother from Columbia. Madonna (Patricia Rae) is a devout Catholic who views divorce as sinful. In order to put up a good front for his mother and sister (Ayora) Alejandro asks Don and Ellie to pretend to still be married. Much to the chagrin of Bebe they agree. Hilarity ensues. Well not really but thats what the filmmakers would like viewers to believe. Theres not much to say about the movie because theres so little there in the way of substance. As wedding-related movies go its closer to the worst than the best. Its pretty obviously targeted at middle-aged women which makes it ideal ""counterprogramming"" for the male-oriented Pain amp; Gain which opens the same weekend. Perhaps the most impressive thing about The Big Wedding is how many A-list actors signed on to be in the production of a relatively unknown director - Justin Zackhams only previous credit is the forgettable (and forgotten) 2001 feature Going Greek. Still none of them does stand-out work - they come say their lines and get their paychecks. Everything about The Big Wedding is generic from the title to the plot to the payoff. Even clocking in at a skinny 90 minutes its a waste of time.

Kon-Tiki Review A 1951 Oscar Documentary Winner Becomes a Rousing 2013 Adventure Pain amp; Gain Review Funny But Bloated Three Stooges With Massive Pecs This nuptial farce is the kind of film best enjoyed while on the couch zonked out on cold medicine secure in the knowledge that it wont make you any sicker If you were shying away from ""The Big Wedding"" because (a) it has the word ""wedding"" in the title; (b) the cast includes Katherine Heigl and/or (c) the cast also includes Robin Williams as a Catholic priest providing marriage counseling thus calling to mind his similar role in the wince-inducing ""License to Wed"" well ... those are all actually valid points come to think of it. Still in its defense its worth noting that this farce is funnier (and naughtier) than it has any right to be and that Heigl gives her most winning performance in years -- precisely because shes playing a rage-filled character and not a simpering romantic lead. Even Williams dials it down a notch or 10 and plays well with the films staggeringly all-star cast all of whom do the heavy lifting to make this piffle at least marginally entertaining. ""The Big Wedding"" isnt great but its not horrible either. Its the Jordan Almond you eat at the reception not because its tasty but because it looks pretty. Its the sort of movie best enjoyed while on the couch zonked out on cold medicine and secure in the knowledge that it wont make you any sicker. Writer-director Justin Zackham adapting the French comedy ""Mon frere se marie"" establishes its R-rated credentials early on with Ellie (Diane Keaton) accidentally walking in on her ex-husband Donald (Robert De Niro) as hes about to begin orally pleasuring his longtime girlfriend Bebe (Susan Sarandon). Ellie has returned for the wedding of her and Donalds adopted son Alejandro (Ben Barnes ""The Chronicles of Narnia Prince Caspian"") to lifelong friend and neighbor Missy (Amanda Seyfried). As in any farce or big family occasion there are plenty of mini-dramas going on besides Ellie and Donalds awkward reunion; their daughter Lyla (Heigl) has just kicked out her husband (Kyle Bornheimer) while their son Jared (Topher Grace) is a 29-year-old doctor still holding out to lose his virginity to his true love. On top of that Missys WASPy parents (Christine Ebersole and David Rasche) clearly have issues with their daughter marrying a Colombian. Compounding the craziness is the impending arrival of Alejandros biological mother Madonna (Patricia Rae) visiting the U.S. for the first time. Alejandro worries that her intense Catholicism will make her object to his adoptive parents divorce so he asks Ellie and Donald to pretend like theyre still married until the wedding is over. (Along for the ride is Ana Ayora as Alejandros sister Nuria who seems like she might be the perfect candidate to end Jareds dry spell.) Once the plates start spinning there arent a lot of surprises but the presence of so many old pros injects a great deal of life into ""The Big Wedding."" Shockingly this is the first time Sarandon has worked with either Keaton or De Niro but the three of them mesh beautifully fully convincing as a trio of old friends (Ellie and Bebe were best pals before Bebe and Donald hooked up) and carting in lots of characterization that would be otherwise lacking in Zackhams rote screenplay. (His major previous credit was writing the hoary ""The Bucket List."" Given the tame PG-13 age in which we live theres something to be said for a movie owning its R rating and letting big stars get a little bawdy. The charge of seeing Keaton (delightful throughout particularly given her recent run of duds like ""Mad Money"" and ""Because I Said So"") talk about nine-hour orgasms or Heigl letting De Niro have it with both barrels for his wastrel-ish ways gives the movie some much-needed zing.

For the most part this star-studded comedy about zany family melodramas during one wedding weekend does exactly what youd expect of something so disposable -- it takes generic situations and handles them generically. But the likable cast made up of so much talent wins us over just enough to exasperate us that they dont have more to do. Heres the setup Don (Robert De Niro) and Ellie (Diane Keaton) have three grown kids -- two biological one adopted -- and theyve been divorced for years. Shes been sowing her oats traveling around the world while he has shacked up with Bebe (Susan Sarandon) Ellies best friend with whom shes still on good terms. Now everybodys gathering together because Alejandro (Ben Barnes) the couples adopted Colombian son is getting married to lily-white society girl Missy (Amanda Seyfried). But Alejandro has invited his biological mother Madonna (Patricia Rae) with whom he has reconnected to the wedding. Trouble is shes a devout Catholic and thinks divorce is a sin. Thus Don and Ellie have to pretend to still be married. (Really? Shes that religious?) And sure enough as they get back together sparks start to refly. Meanwhile their oldest Lyla (Katherine Heigl) has just split up with her husband and discovered shes pregnant while their other son Jared (Topher Grace) a doctor whos been saving himself for true love is sorely tempted when Madonna brings along Nuria (Ana Ayora) her hot-to-trot daughter. Got all that? Everything in The Big Wedding feels borrowed from some other movie a little La Cage aux Folles/The Birdcage here a little Its Complicated there. When the horny Nuria secretly jerks off Jared at the dinner table you might get flashbacks to Wedding Crashers. And so on and so forth. Apparently this is a loose remake of a little-known Swiss film Mon Frere se Marie about a Swiss family and their adopted Vietnamese son and the central conflict there was not about religion but about the fact that the son had been writing to his biological mother for years telling her how perfect his life in the West was hiding the insane dysfunction in his adopted home. That already makes much more sense than ""Shes from Colombia and they dont believe in divorce over there"" And a Swiss family not knowing a lick of Vietnamese we can understand; why does this ostensibly well-educated well-off American family not know a word of Spanish -- other than for the fact that the screenplay must have it so to make for cumbersome linguistic hijinks? Add to this some of the most pointless pratfalls Ive seen onscreen recently and youd think we were in for a real Garry Marshall-level disaster. But go figure The Big Wedding isnt terrible. De Niro is actually pretty good here -- the script gives him plenty of raunchy one-liners and while theyre mostly lame he delivers with conviction which counts for something nowadays. Keaton who can be shticky is fairly restrained and charming. The beautiful Sarandon suffers gracefully her proud upturned chin even more upturned than usual. Even Heigl whose career has been foundering of late after a promising start in rom-coms manages to evoke some sympathy. But the film has no real idea what to do with these actors in part because each seems lost in his or her story line and at a whisper-thin 90 minutes the film cant build up enough narrative energy to bring them all together in any meaningful way. Not that it seems interested in doing so. Rather The Big Wedding just tries to remain pleasant -- to a fault. The drama of Keaton betraying her best friend by bedding her ex-husband isnt played up at all -- the plot only dwells on it for a few minutes with the jaunty score jauntily jauntying along as if nothing happened. Meanwhile the soon-to-be-wed couple -- Seyfried and Barnes -- make regular faces of outrage or surprise or disgust at the goings-on but none of it registers because the film doesnt seem willing to ever truly lay any of its characters low Everyone mostly seems to get along. Even the local Catholic priest played by Robin Williams whom one presumes would offer some kind of judgment on the proceedings mostly shrugs at the antics. While Williamss nonchalance is one of the more interesting elements in the movie it feels like a strategic mistake -- a wasted opportunity to create some narrative urgency. Come to think of it though ""wasted opportunity"" would be a good way to describe the entirety of this tepid inoffensive trifle.

"The Big Wedding (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Big Wedding (R) This wedding crashes Robert DeNiro and Diane Keaton in The Big Wedding. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com4/26/2013 Editor rating 1 The Big Wedding is a would-be screwball comedy that forgets to throw in the screws. Instead we get gross-out jokes (an unexpected blast of vomit) racist stereotypes (like the Latina beauty who cant keep her clothes on and wants to have sex with every man she sees) homophobic gags (when a character announces shes a lesbian everyone shrieks in horror) and idiotic contrived characters (a 29-year-old obstetrician who is still a virgin even though every nurse in the hospital drools after him; or an attorney who tries to smoke in a hospital and is so afraid of motherhood that she faints when she sees a baby). Inspired by the French comedy Mon frere se marie writer-director Justin Chatham follows the original films template about a wealthy family preparing for the marriage of their adopted son Alejandro (Ben Barnes). In order to not upset Alejandros religious birth mother who is traveling from Colombia to attend the ceremony Don and Ellie (Robert De Niro and Diane Keaton) the couple who raised Alejandro before going through a bitter divorce must pretend to still love each other. This doesnt sit well with Dons current girlfriend Bebe (Susan Sarandon) who happens to be catering the wedding. The Big Wedding sets up a bunch of scenarios that are supposed to culminate in an all-out farce. But with the exception of a couple of scenes in which De Niro and Keaton drop some f-bombs on each other during an argument nothing in this bland comedy works. As Alejandros baby-phobic sister Katherine Heigl continues to prove she has the worst agent in the world. The reliable Topher Grace who is usually good for a laugh or two is on autopilot as if even he didnt believe in his characters self-imposed chastity. Robin Williams pops up in what is essentially a cameo but all he contributes is to overpronounce Alejandros name like Jane Curtin used to pronounce ""Nicaragua"" on Saturday Night Live. There is also a mildly racist streak running through the film beginning with the casting of the British-born Barnes who played Prince Caspian in two of the Narnia movies as a dark-skinned Colombian. The actor looks like hes spent too much time on a tanning bed or is sporting spray-on makeup (instead of blackface call it Latinoface). There is much talk about ""beige bilingual babies"" and in one scene Keaton takes a walk through the woods with Alejandros mother and has a heart-to-heart talk with her even though the woman doesnt speak any English. The scene comes off as painfully patronizing. The Big Wedding belongs to that realm of comedy about fabulously wealthy white people (think My Darling Companion or Somethings Gotta Give) who seem to have no connection to the real world and have no interest in it either. People who live in Cape Cod might enjoy the film and relate to the characters dilemmas. Most viewers though will feel like theyre staring at aliens.

Its stars Emmanuelle Riva and Jean-Louis Trintignant evoked the iconography of the New Wave the once-young faces of Hiroshima mon amour and My Night at Mauds now withered in old age. To watch them slip agonizingly into death was in a sense by extension somewhat like watching the movies of our past fade away.Justin Zackhams vile The Big Wedding also opens with a foray back through silver-screen history though in this case the legacy is embarrassed. When Ellie (Diane Keaton) walks in on her ex-husband Don (Robert De Niro) as he moves to perform kitchen-counter cunnilingus on his new girlfriend Bebe (Susan Sarandon) its possible as in Amour to see aging legends of the cinema imagined suddenly together as if Annie Hall and Travis Bickle and Louise Sawyer one day found themselves playing out some producers laziest scene ideas. There is in other words a lot of history in The Big Wedding--a history the film not so much squanders as utterly defaces recalling greatness before swiftly denigrating it.Its a sad thing to see a great actor descend after decades of valued work into self-parody--feebly mimicking the trademark tics and mannerisms of former glory. Its an even sadder thing to see three actors plummet to new career lows over the course of a single film. De Niro of course has been in steady decline since Analyze This took him on a 13-year detour through lowbrow comedy but it was at last beginning to seem with his recent Academy Award nomination for Silver Linings Playbook that things might be turning around. The Big Wedding was shelved for years before finally seeing the light of day so its of the bad years. De Niro plays a tired schtick for broad laughs futzing around his oversized lakeside home in exaggeratedly dowdy Lebowskian robes sneaking in snifters of whiskey when his family isnt looking. Nothing more than a catalog of crass cliches acted out as affectations its the worst kind of sad clown routine mopey and vulgar Don is reprehensible even when inevitably redeemed.Film Details The Big Wedding RatingR GenreComedy Running Time89 More Info Trailer And yes everybody finds nominal redemption in The Big Wedding which plots out narrative connections like a second-rate Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu whose conspicuously layered narratives (Babel 21 Grams Amores Perros) seem subtle by comparison. The wedding here is an excuse to draw together a dozen-plus cardboard characters whose prefab arcs end as obviously as they begin. The moment were introduced to handsome but virginal doctor Jared (Topher Grace) we can be assured that well see him pop his proverbial cherry by films end. Same goes for elder sister Lyla (Katherine Heigl) whose pained journey from barren womb to baby bump is too predictable to bother spoiler-warning. But worst of all is the inane sub-sitcom premise and ludicrous circumstances that require Don and Ellie to carry on a farce of a fake marriage over the course of the wedding.Its hard to sell a plot this patently absurd so naturally the filmmakers fall back on a reliable excuse Casual racism of the most flagrant and galling variety. The son about to be married is Alejandro (Ben Barnes) adopted as a child from Colombia. His biological mother the devoutly religious Madonna (Patricia Rae) will be visiting for the ceremony and since she is under the impression that Alejandros adoptive parents are still married the film reasons that they must continue the illusion lest Madonna lose faith in the future of her son. Madonna is joined by Nuria (Ana Ayora) Alejandros biological sister and together the two represent some of the most repugnant foreign stereotyping in years. The film divides these women--the only non-white characters in its ensemble--into a literal mother/whore dichotomy. Nuria is relegated to the demeaning role of grossly oversexualized fetish object an exotic Other only present to strip nude and seduce one of the white male leads; after shes introduced skinny-dipping in public she gives her new host a hand job under a restaurant table.Madonna meanwhile looms over the action with the watchful eye of the delicate old-world soul thoroughly desexualized and emptied of insight or agency made a constant punchline for her foreign values and inability to speak a word of English. The Big Wedding presents itself as a raunchy bit of family fun a rom-com with heart--but the warm and fuzzy feelings only apply if youre white and middle-class (and straight a late-film gag makes a twist out of revealing its least likeable character as secretly queer). Many Hollywood films are founded on privilege but few are as open and nasty about their racism misogyny and homophobia. Its a feel-good movie for people who are only comfortable around people who look and act just like them.Follow VoiceFilmClub Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Calum Marsh Follow calummarsh Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

"The Big Wedding a huge yawn review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Big Wedding a huge yawn reviewStar-studded comedy The Big Wedding has plenty of implied sex and swearing but its just a big yawn. Susan Sarandon Robin Williams and Robert De Niro give us ample reason to cringe in The Big Wedding.  (Barry Wetcher / eOne Films)  By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterFri. April 26 2013The Big WeddingStarring Robert De Niro Diane Keaton Susan Sarandon Katherine Heigl Topher Grace Amanda Seyfried Ben Barnes and Robin Williams. Directed by Justin Zackham. 88 minutes. Opens April 26 at major theatres. 14ABased on the well-used plot device called ""lets pretend were married"" and crammed with stars like some wee car from circus hell topped up with clowns clamouring for a moment in the spotlight The Big Wedding aims low and achieves every aspiration.Press material from the studio describes the onscreen Griffin clan as a ""charmingly modern family"" which is conveyed through a barrage of sex jokes f-bombs and assorted crudities. Its likely you had never equated these things with modernity. Yet by the logic of The Big Wedding Adam Sandler is a real 21st-century man. Article Continued BelowFact is most of the time The Big Wedding is just a big yawn. Its duller than a wedding speech by your drunken uncle and twice as long.It gets off to a bad start when Robert De Niros father-of-the-groom character jovially refers to his ex-wife (played by Diane Keaton) by a particularly crude term. It draws a gasp and a cringe instead of the intended laugh.The exchange is a suitable way to sum up the entire 88 minutes of writer-director Justin Zackhams celebrity-larded flop and feeble attempt at a French farce-style comedy a remake of Jean-Stephane Brons 2006 comedy Mon frere se marie.But points for originality in one regard Zackham may have invented a new genre with The Big Wedding the gross-out geezer pleaser. Hes traded the sentimentality of the script he penned for 2007s The Bucket List for the fratboy assery of his 2001 campus comedy Going Greek.Long-divorced couple Don and Ellie (DeNiro in full Fokker mode and Keaton playing it sweet and stammering a la Somethings Gotta Give) awkwardly reunite at their former New England home for the wedding of angelic Missy (Amanda Seyfried) to their adopted Colombian son Alejandro (Ben Barnes).Perpetually smirking Don hit the jackpot he got the stunning family house and the hot girl. Hes now living with Ellies former bestie Bebe (Susan Sarandon getting all Bull Durham) who wants a ring but will settle for a little rumpus on the kitchen counter. Panties meet ankles. More cringing.The wedding necessitates awkward family reunions with daughter Lyla (Katherine Heigl once again playing a tart-tongued witch) who hates her dad and faints when she sees babies. Doctor-son Jared (Topher Grace) has taken a virginity pledge that will soon be interpreted as challenge by the first hot Latina who comes along. Missy and Alejandro are in prenuptial counselling with Father Moinighan (Robin Williams doing a retread of Reverend Frank in License to Wed) who is a stickler for Catholic doctrine but not much else.Enter Alejandros uptight birth mother Madonna (Patricia Rae) arriving from Colombia to attend the wedding and meet the family that raised her little boy. She may not speak English but she can say ""no way"" to divorce. Just to keep the peace Alejandro asks can Ellie and Don play happy couple just for a weekend?Of course they cant. As evidenced in Valentines Day and New Years Eve (which also included De Niro and Heigl) packing a weak movie with big names doesnt mean audiences can ignore the bad smell rising around them. These kids should have eloped and saved us all 88 minutes of pain.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Which is why an R-rated comedy generally puts its most ""outrageous"" moment upfront to grab some overworked underpaid readers attention. At least I think thats why ""The Big Wedding"" begins with Robert De Niro Susan Sarandon and an oral sex scene. It sets the tone definitely Low. And its a mood the comedy continues to meet with a series of cliched situations bad jokes two-bit characters and gratuitous nudity. The idea if the movies set-up can be dignified with such a word is that Diane Keaton and Robert De Niro have been divorced for years but now their adopted son is getting married -- and his devoutly Catholic Latin American mother would be appalled to know that the people who raised him are no longer wed. This makes no sense. Although the films old bedroom-farce roots are obvious (its based on a French movie) at least stories like the original ""La Cage Aux Folles"" justified their subterfuges. But its irrational that after all these years a birth mother who had never even met her childs adoptive parents would suddenly care whether or not they were still wed. And thats only the beginning of the awful writing in a movie which has girls in glasses (who take them off and turn sexy) and women who suddenly barf (because -- surprise -- theyre pregnant). I wont even go into the scripts wholesale ignorance of Catholic belief and rituals which borders on the willfully insulting. The overloaded cast includes beyond De Niro and Sarandon Diane Keaton as De Niros ex Topher Grace Katherine Heigl and Ben Barnes as their children and Amanda Seyfried Christine Ebersole and Robin Williams in thankless supporting roles. All are nicely dressed here and obviously game -- probably far more game than the target audience. Unless your idea of fun is Sarandon hobbling around with her panties around her ankles or De Niro bragging about his erections and calling Keaton a crude four-letter word. None of them have much to play with -- theres no reason why De Niros character should be quite so despised or Barnes so terrified of his birth mothers reaction. The jokes just arent there and -- unlike a proper farce such as say ""Death at a Funeral"" -- theres no uproarious final act that pushes things past the breaking point. I suppose its always nice to get an invitation but please this ""Wedding""? Send back your regrets. Its too dull too crowded too ugly. And as for its time in theaters? I give it a week.

If so The Big Wedding would be my humble suggestion - its just such a shining example of a dull studio comedy. So lets make like the prof and dissect the damn thing. Multimedia The Big Wedding The official trailer CastingBe sure to have a cross-generational assortment of names to maximize audience appeal. Here suiting up for the older crowd are Diane Keaton Robert De Niro and Susan Sarandon - the first is a regular habitue of this formulaic schtick; the second sadly is becoming so; and Sarandon might have been keen for the paycheque. Sprinkled in for the younger set are Katherine Heigl Topher Grace and Amanda Seyfried. Since they all keep their clothes on its essential to recruit a curvaceous brunette who does not - Ana Ayora by name but by profession at least in this case the token eye-candy guaranteed to promote male ogling across the chronological spectrum.SettingA country mansion in Connecticut a big white house where big white rich folks live where the backyard pool glistens blue and the adjoining lake sparkles green and where the spacious grounds offer ample room to set up the big tents for the big wedding. The house of course is a character unto itself a different type of eye-candy but also there to admire and perhaps even lust after.PremiseWriter/director Justin Zackham claims to have borrowed the premise from a Franco-Swiss film although that sounds like so much posturing to these cynical ears. Its a lot more generic than that. For reasons that defy logic a divorced couple (Keaton and De Niro) must pretend theyre married in order to maintain appearances during the wedding. Why? Oh so confusion and hilarity can ensue. Feel free to correct me but it seems that exact premise has been used in countless forgettable Hollywood comedies although understandably Ive forgotten which ones.ComedyTwo basic brands here. First the just plain dumb kind. There is as you will recall a lake. Into this lake a dock extends. And from that dock someone - preferably a stuffy someone elaborately over-dressed - must fall splash into the water. Someone does.Second the sexy dumb kind. There is also a pool. Into that pool to the dismay of the stuffed shirts someone must skinny-dip. If you guessed the eye-candy skip the rest of the class and head straight to grad school.DramaTo humanize all this antic funny business some poor actor must play the troubled soul. That would be Heigl as the daughter of Big Daddy De Niro. Her marriage is rocky and she whines a lot and oops shes carrying around a secret. Now if you can guess that secret skip this class and grad school and book an immediate flight to Tinseltown - a lucrative writing job awaits you.CameoIt comes courtesy of Robin Williams who wears a stiff white collar around his neck and a perpetual smirk on his face. The collar tells us hes a priest; the smirk tell us hes trapped in a dull studio comedy. Again. So are we. Again. Hell has another circle and it even bears a rating - two paltry stars endlessly chasing each other.

Lionsgate photo Do not RSVP to The Big Wedding By Joe Williams joewilliamspost-dispatch.com 314-340-8344 Joe Williams Apr 26 2013 (...) Barry Wetcher Robert De Niro and Diane Keaton in ""The Big Wedding."" Lionsgate photo Blame it on the Fockers.After the critical and commercial success of ""Meet the Parents"" Robert De Niro tried to milk laughs from lesser comedies. But certain things cant be milked. Its nearly tragic to see Americas Greatest Living Actor on the guest list for ""The Big Wedding"" the latest limp comedy about seniors behaving badly.Although the title implies that this is a sentimental special-occasion comedy like ""New Years Eve"" (an all-star fiasco from which De Niro emerged relatively unscathed) its more like a crass kinsman who pukes in the punchbowl. In his first scene De Niro upchucks a half-dozen slang terms for oral sex and it goes downhill from there. De Niro plays Don an inexplicably affluent sculptor who bungled his marriage to Ellie (Diane Keaton). After a 10-year spiritual odyssey overseas Ellie returns for the wedding of their adopted Colombian son Alejandro (miscast British actor Ben Barnes) at the big lakeside home that Don now shares with Ellies former friend Bebe (Susan Sarandon).Three days before Alejandro is due to marry Melissa (romantic-comedy kiss of death Amanda Seyfried) he requests that his adoptive parents pretend to be married again for the benefit of his strictly Catholic biological mother Madonna (Patricia Rae) who is on her way to the States for the first time. So on the flimsy basis of respecting the sensitivities of a stranger who doesnt speak English Ellie moves into the house and Bebe moves out -- and then poses as a caterer to keep an eye on recovering-alcoholic Don.As if that werent sitcom-y enough Ellie and Don have two other adult children lawyer Lyla (the ubiquitous Katherine Heigl) whose marriage is faltering because she cant have children; and doctor Jared (Topher Grace) a 30-year-old virgin who develops funny feelings for Madonnas manhandling daughter Nuria (Ana Ayora). Adapted from a Swiss comedy and credited to a neophyte writer/director named Justin Zackham ""The Big Wedding"" doesnt have a single moment of recognizable humanity.On the plus side its short and Robin Williams as a racist priest is blessedly limited to an extended cameo. Perhaps well get more of Williams along with bickering bridesmaids and a flamboyant wedding planner in the inevitable bonus-packed home video -- which would make the perfect wedding gift for someone you despise.What ""The Big Wedding""  One and a half stars out of four  Rating R  Run time 131  Content Strong language adult themes and brief nudity Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

Sadly superior talent can propel a movie only so far. Bad scripts beget bad movies even when four Academy Award winners are involved. The story based on the 2006 Swiss-French film ""Mon Frere Se Marie"" launches just before the wedding of the Griffin familys youngest adopted son. The fraught joyous event promises to reunite the whole clan. The problem is that patriarch Don (De Niro) hasnt seen his ex-wife Ellie (Keaton) in 10 years and hes currently shacked up with her best friend Bebe (Sarandon). Further complicating things daughter Lyla (Katherine Heigl) disdains her father which is clear by the way she calls him by his first name spitting out the single syllable like a bad grape. And that isnt all. The groom Alejandro (Ben Barnes) invited his ultra-Catholic Colombian biological mother and sister to the nuptials. Fearing they may blanch at his adoptive parents separation he (in a ""Birdcage""-like twist) requests that Don and Ellie pretend to still be married just for the weekend. Preposterous though it may sound the story has possibility and might have been well-suited to the same baby boomer ticket buyers who flock to Nancy Meyerss films (""Its Complicated"" ""Somethings Gotta Give""). But the comedy lacks one very important ingredient a truly likeable or even mildly relatable character. Don takes the title of most offensive persona. The aging lech may be challenging himself to drop as many expletives into each sentence as possible. He brags to his daughter about his talents for ""laying pipe"" and in one scene delivers a two-for-one pickup line simultaneously hitting on his ex-wife and his paramour. While matriarch Ellie is a bit of a nightmare especially when discussing tantric sex at the dinner table daughter Lyla edges her out on the most-horrifying-character list. She is bitter mean and possibly incapable of smiling and Heigls politicians-wife hair style hardly softens her image. Vivacious pug enthusiast Bebe is far more enjoyable although between her embroidery room homemade kombucha and organic catering company shes more caricature than authentic individual. When Williams appears onscreen in a priests collar something funny -- meaning interesting not comedic -- happens. Reflexively the audience begins to giggle. He doesnt even have to say a word. And maybe it would be better if he didnt because even the seasoned comedian cant land the movies lazy jokes as he questions the betrothed couple about premarital sex and contraception. Among the few bright spots is Topher Grace who plays the Griffins oldest son a virgin doctor pushing 30. His timing and facial expressions may remind audiences why the actor once starred in his own sitcom. And Seyfried has an effortless screen presence that even amid the contrived farce feels natural. As the movie trudges toward its conclusion the script attempts to ferret out emotion from the audience. But by then theres no chance of feeling sympathy for a cad and his mostly mean-spirited family. Even the susceptible softies who always cry at weddings will probably leave the theater dry-eyed not to mention feeling a little empty inside. Contains crude language sexual situations and nudity.

"Review The Big Wedding aims its raunchiness at the AARP crowd - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Movies_nowReview The Big Wedding aims its raunchiness at the AARP crowdRobert De Niro Diane Keaton and Susan Sarandon head a talented cast that is wasted.April 25 2013|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Katherine Heigl left as Lyla and Susan Sarandon as Bebe ""The Big... (Barry Wetcher )Dont be fooled into thinking that ""The Big Wedding"" is about the fetching young bride and groom. This is gross-out humor for the senior set.With raunchy comedies all the rage I guess it was inevitable that sooner or later someone would go for the AARP crowd.FOR THE RECORD ""The Big Wedding"" A movie review of ""The Big Wedding"" in the April 26 Calendar section misspelled Colombia as Columbia. a ""The Big Wedding"" is unabashed and unashamed though its cast of top-tier talent should be starting with Robert De Niro Diane Keaton and Susan Sarandon.PHOTOS Movies Sneaks 2013That might sound ageist but it would be hard to outstrip the movie on that front.Consider the nine-hour orgasm.Sound impossible? Just ask Keaton. She plays De Niros ex Ellie who is eager to let everyone know exactly how satisfying it was. The duration is mentioned many times though even if Ellie had enlisted the entire lineup of ""Magic Mike"" I dont think its possible a or medically advisable a at any age. And every time Ellie is pressed to mention it Keaton looks slightly apologetic. To see Keaton shine in a later-day sex-capade rent ""Somethings Gotta Give"" and watch a woman of a certain age in a truly funny flirt with Jack Nicholson.De Niro. I fear for him. There are now at least two generations of moviegoers who probably dont know anything about him beyond flatulence jokes and Fockers though after ""The Big Wedding"" Im reassessing the merits of the Focker films.I thought perhaps with his good turn in ""Silver Linings Playbook"" last year the actor was going to be more selective in his roles. Although another ""Raging Bull"" or ""Taxi Driver"" might not be in the cards there must be better projects that would actually use his skills.Instead the talent and a great face which is aging in such interesting ways is wasted as Don a sculptor of sometimes erotic figures. Oh and Dons the dad.PHOTOS Movies Sneaks 2013Sarandon. She makes even a bad movie better. Her Bebe was Ellies best friend until she bedded Don and thats what caused the family rift that the kids are trying to patch up for the wedding weekend that is technically the reason were all gathered here.Robin Williams. He plays the priest who spends most of his time in a confessional forced to listen to all the indiscretions so he can be forgiven for being forgiving a keeping his hands and his comments relatively circumspect.Director Justin Zackham whose first film was 2001s ""Going Greek"" about a nerd joining a wild and crazy fraternity adapted the screenplay from the 2006 French film ""Mon frA""re se Marie."" The French are usually better at sex comedies than we are but even ""Mon frA""re se Marie"" wasnt much of a success.Strangely the kids are the conservative ones.PHOTOS Celebrities by The TimesAmanda Seyfried is the bride and shes often blushing. Shes marrying Don and Ellies youngest and the only one in this cast besides Bebe whose name youll remember. Its Alejandro a trill those Rs everyone. Portrayed by Ben Barnes Alejandros Latin heritage a hes adopted a is the only thing other than sex that is used for comic fodder. It is universally politically incorrect a from the ""brown babies"" the brides parents fear to the chimichangas they order up during the rehearsal dinner.Katherine Heigl and Topher Grace are Alejandros older American brother and sis. Grace plays a doctor 30 whos saving himself for marriage or true love or a really hot chick to come along. She does in Alejandros biological sister (Ana Ayora). Meanwhile Heigl has a beef with dad but we dont know what it is or care.The only other person of interest is Madonna (Patricia Rae). Shes Alejandros biological mother a conservative Catholic from Columbia who would apparently be appalled to know that the family she placed her son with is fractured by divorce. Thus for a weekend the family must perform a farce a Bebe has to take a back seat while Ellie and Don pretend to be married again. Let the games begin.To be fair there are moments that earn their laughs and nostalgic memories for the marriage that was and the relationship that is that are sweet. But like many big weddings a a lot of things go wrong and not much goes right.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com PHOTOS AND MORE Roger Ebert Career in pictures ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz PHOTOS Greatest box office flops MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESReview Barefoot is no walk in the park its a stumbleFebruary 20 2014MORE STORIES ABOUTMovies_nowNot_live_webEntertainmentDiane KeatonCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-mn-big-wedding-movie-review-20130426,0,2887955.story?track=rss&utm_source=feedly",200,thebigwedding14,thebigwedding,latimes

Special to Newsday + - Don (Robert De Niro) and Ellie (Diane Keaton) in ""The Big Wedding"" directed by Justin Zackham. In theaters on April 26 2013. Photo Credit Lionsgate Film advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Mix-ups ensue at a society wedding in Greenwich where the grooms divorced parents must pretend to still be married. Rated R (language sexual content brief nudity) BOTTOM LINE Produced in 2012 except for the jokes and the whole set-up produced in about 1955 CAST Robert De Niro Katherine Heigl Diane Keaton Amanda Seyfried Topher Grace Ben Barnes Susan Sarandon Robin Williams LENGTH 130 Some people cry at weddings. Viewers of this film will cry at having spent money for ""The Big Wedding."" Ostensibly poking fun at the society rituals of Caucasian Connecticut this comedy of a familys wedding weekend offers such good old-fashioned comic racism as a priest (Robin Williams) asking the adopted Colombian-born groom if he speaks English -- and blithely paying no attention when the Harvard-educated Alejandro (Ben Barnes) replies both in English and in Chinese two of his five languages. Elsewhere we have a dad-to-be in a hospital waiting room being informed by the nurse that hes just become a father -- evidently the last father since 1975 not to be in the birthing room when his child is born. Oh and a lady faints which generally hasnt been done since about 1955. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? One might think ""The Big Wedding"" is being ironically retro but there isnt any such self-awareness at work -- writer-director Justin Zackham screenwriter of the equally divorced-from-reality film ""The Bucket List"" (2007) doesnt seem to exist in a world of normal conversation modern mores and well 2013. Even the premise borrowed from the French comedy ""Mon Frere Se Marie"" (2006) is one hoary sitcom cliche The grooms divorced parents Don and Ellie (Robert De Niro and Diane Keaton) must pretend to be married so as not to upset Alejandros Catholic birth mother (Patricia Rae). Of course that ticks off Dons live-in lady friend (Susan Sarandon). Wacky complications do not ensue. Add Katherine Heigl and Topher Grace as Don and Ellies other two kids Amanda Seyfried as bride Missy and Ana Ayora as Alejandros seductive Colombian sister and youve pretty much got the recipe for one of those star-studded 1960s romps like ""Its a Mad Mad Mad Mad World."" Except this movie plays like an episode of ""Gilligans Island"" done as straight as an episode of ""Lost.""

Daily Edition Login to download The Big Wedding Film Review 442 PM PDT 4/25/2013 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS A sex farce with and for the Viagra generation. TWITTER Robert De Niro Susan Sarandon Diane Keaton Robin Williams Katherine Heigl and Amanda Seyfried lead a star-studded cast in ""Bucket List"" writer Justin Zackhams directorial debut. A game cast and lots of gamey R-rated shenanigans cant compensate for the silly comic contrivances that dominate The Big Wedding. The fact that the three actors who do most of the fooling around -- Robert De Niro Diane Keaton and Susan Sarandon -- have a combined age of 202 pegs this as a sex romp for the Viagra crowd which will probably translate into moderate theatrical returns followed by sustained popularity on home screens where it can be enjoyed in whatever way desired in the privacy of the boudoir. The fact that this directorial debut by Justin Zackham (writer of The Bucket List) is going places not visited by such previous mature-oriented sexcapades as Its Complicated and Town amp; Country is announced at the outset when Keatons Ellie walks in on ex-husband Don (De Niro) just as hes about to have current live-in flame Bebe (Sarandon) for breakfast on the kitchen counter. Ellie has returned to the lavish Connecticut estate to attend the wedding of the son she and Don adopted together Alejandro (Ben Barnes) to the daughter Missy (Amanda Seyfried) of longtime local friends Muffin (Christine Ebersole) and Barry (David Rasche). VIDEO The Big Wedding Trailer Massive complications are core architectural parts of any good farce but the films problems begin with how unconvincing and fundamentally annoying the central premise is. In his adaptation of the 2006 French farce Mon frere se marie Zackham makes Alejandros Colombian birth mother out to be a woman of such rigid Catholic rectitude that assorted fictions must be concocted so as not to offend her. First her sons bride must be a church-certified virgin. Whats more it cannot be admitted that Don and Ellie have divorced which forces Bebe out of Dons bed and Ellie back in for the weekend. On top of that the couples real son Jared (Topher Grace) at 29 actually still is a virgin and intends to remain so until he finds the right woman to love. All these strained inventions dig the film into a deep hole from which it struggles to emerge for its blessedly tight 90-minute running time. Lightening the load of the religious angle is a Catholic priest (Robin Williams in uncloying fleet-footed form) whose nimble way of reconciling doctrine with the realities of contemporary life proves disarming. However when Madonna (Patricia Rae) who speaks no English and her hot daughter Nuria (Ana Ayora) arrive from South America its almost as if the Pope himself is present as the others bow and scrape and in all ways try to maintain the charade of propriety. Its a losing battle to say the least. Zackham has followed the rules of the form by multiplying the characters sexual connections past present and future to an almost ludicrous breaking point. These are revealed only with time but its safe to say that the old-timers are far more responsible for the bad behavior than the younger generation Don is a famously randy sculptor for whom morals are a theoretical issue Ellie has done some high-level sexual questing since the divorce Bebe is still obviously hot stuff and Muffin ... well best not to give away her secrets. As far as the kids go Alejandro and Missy the most boring characters around only have eyes for each other while a somber and realistic note is struck by Lyla (Katherine Heigl) Don and Ellies oldest child whos depressed over being pregnant but just split from her boyfriend. The most frisky twentysomething here is Nuria who sets her sights on Jared until learning his secret and then playing hard to get. Cutesy contrived and formulaic in the early-going when everyones trying to behave themselves the brightly lit and designed production becomes rather more bearable when everyone lets their hair down and lets their hormones do the talking. Younger audiences might recoil from the spectacle of actors old enough to be their grandparents jumping each others bones even if unlike Ayora they dont indulge in any real nudity. But at a certain point the natural earthy enthusiasm of Sarandon Keaton and particularly De Niro begins taking over the movie which provides its own sort of pleasure. In the original French film the host couple is Swiss and the mother of the groom is Vietnamese.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 6 p.m. EDT April 25 2013A few laughs and an all-star cast arent enough reason to say ""I do"" to this formulaic unrealistic film.Alejandro (Ben Barnes) and Missy (Amanda Seyfried) are the bride and groom at the center of The Big Wedding.(Photo Barry Wetcher Lionsgate)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY Review  out of fourStars Robert De Niro Katherine Heigl Diane Keaton Amanda Seyfried Topher Grace Susan Sarandon Robin WilliamsRated R; Runtime 1 hour 30 minutes; Opens Friday nationwideIt might take a glass of champagne or two to get through The Big Wedding.The nuptials of this affluent blended family -- unlike any actual collection of humans on earth -- are hardly a cause for celebration.The cobbled-together story (  out of four; rated R; opens Friday nationwide) is forced formulaic and never believable. Its a particularly unholy combination.While the movies contrivances are occasionally mitigated by a few laugh lines from Robin Williams as a recovering alcoholic Catholic priest and Robert De Niro as a randy sculptor most of the cast is playing versions of characters theyve played before.Diane Keaton is Ellie the daffy adventurous ex-wife of Don (De Niro). Susan Sarandon is Bebe Dons daffy adventurous girlfriend and Ellies best friend.Don and Ellie have three grown children. The youngest who was adopted from Colombia is getting married. But the vows cant be made without a lot of clumsily executed and farcical shenanigans.STORY Hollywoods hot new target demo? Baby BoomersMORE The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYThere are a few comic zingers in the dialogue by writer/director Justin Zackham (who wrote The Bucket List) but the slapstick physical humor falls completely flat.The all-star cast may have simply wanted to work together in scenic surroundings. But its unclear why the filmmakers cast a British actor Ben Barnes to play a Colombian and speak awkward Spanish when there are plenty of good Latino actors around.Though most everyone rolls their eyes about Don the patriarch of the successful but neurotic Griffin family they all get along remarkably well. The women cant stop paying each other compliments and the kids accept Bebe as a de facto stepmom.Those kids are Alejandro (Barnes) the impending groom; Lyla (Katherine Heigl) a lawyer who obsessively checks her phone for messages from the boyfriend she dumped; and Jared (Topher Grace) a doctor and 30-year-old virgin looking for love.Now in his 20s Alejandro was given up for adoption as a child in Colombia by his mother Madonna (Patricia Rae) who wanted him to grow up with the best opportunities. But when she shows up for the wedding she brings along her 20-year-old daughter Nuria (Ana Ayora) who speaks perfect English and seems to have been well-educated in her homeland.In any event Alejandro is now set to marry Missy (Amanda Seyfried in a role thats essentially the exuberant bride she played in Mamma Mia). Missys parents Muffin (Christine Ebersole) and Barry (David Rasche) are moronic social climbers who worry about having ""beige"" children. These closed-minded racists are referred to as good friends of the super-liberal Griffins though its unlikely that could occur in the real world. But then little that happens here bears resemblance to reality.To make matters more far-fetched the ultra-religious Madonna doesnt approve of divorce so exes Don and Ellie agree to pretend they are still husband and wife so as not to upset her. But Zackham didnt even bother to keep the mothers ultra-conservative character consistent. One minute she sternly insists on traditional values the next shes all hot bothered and envious at the sounds of noisy lovemaking.The Big Wedding is a sloppy affair with only partially formed characters and ridiculous scenarios that strain credulity and patience. 23 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/XZnu8v",http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~r/UsatodaycomMovies-TopStories/~3/t6_GzvhS_3M/?utm_source=feedly,200,thebigwedding17,thebigwedding,usatoday

Writer-director Justin Zackham awkwardly blends feel-good pablum and raunchy sex jokes with the expected nuptial ingredients something old (just look at that cast) something new (the groom is an adopted Colombian with three moms to manage) something borrowed (Nancy Meyers called she wants her ideas back) and something blue (handjobs at the rehearsal dinner etc.). Its all catnip for the easily pleased suggesting possible sleeper success amid louder early-summer studio fare. Skewing older than other recent R-rated wedding comedies such as ""Bridesmaids"" and ""Bachelorette"" ""The Big Wedding"" all but ignores the happy couple in favor of the ""bigger"" sixtysomething names in its starry ensemble Robert De Niro Diane Keaton and Susan Sarandon. As in Jean-Stephane Brons 2007 original the grownups childish antics threaten to upset the whole event. Misleading title aside young Missy and Alejandros union is a relatively small affair held in the grooms backyard and consisting of only about 100 guests. The vanilla bride (Amanda Seyfried whos been down this road before in ""Mamma Mia"") and her swarthy husband-to-be (British actor Ben Barnes Prince Caspian in the ""Chronicles of Narnia"" series) have known each other since childhood. What makes their engagement interesting is the fact that Alejandro was born in Colombia and raised by an upscale Connecticut couple with two kids of their own. Naturally Alejandro wants his birth mother Madonna (Patricia Rae) to attend but he doesnt have the nerve to tell the conservative Catholic woman that his adoptive parents Don and Ellie Griffin (De Niro and Keaton a million miles from ""The Godfather Part II"") have been divorced for the past decade. Instead he begs Don to stash his new g.f. Bebe (Sarandon) and pretend that everythings still rock-solid between him and Ellie -- the sort of arrangement that must seem all too familiar to ""The Birdcage"" star Robin Williams (unusually restrained as the ceremonys Irish priest). Surely ""The Big Weddings"" paucity of genuinely inspired moments is due less to Williams involvement than its other officiant Zackham who has captured the bright hyper-sunny look of Nora Ephron and David Frankel movies (simply by using d.p. Jonathan Brown) without grasping those helmers gift for comedy. The film isnt so much funny as it is merely amusing -- a laundry list of inappropriate and potentially embarrassing moments that strive mightily but never quite manage to land the laugh. The awkward situations begin with Ellies arrival at her former home. Letting herself in she accidentally walks in on Don going down on Bebe (who was once Ellies best friend and evidently still manages to excite the man she stole 10 years earlier). After the three grownups agree to Alejandros charade Ellie turns the tables enjoying a 40-minute morning-sex session loud enough to convince not only Madonna but everyone else within a two-mile radius that she and Don are still compatible. Meanwhile the Griffins two biological children show up with plenty of their own issues. Lyla (a high-strung Katherine Heigl) has just broken up with her long-time b.f. has unexplained barfing spells and faints at the sight of a maternity ward. You dont have to be an obstetrician to recognize the symptoms though her slow-on-the-uptake brother Jared (Topher Grace) inexplicably diagnoses her as having a mild concussion. Unlike the rest of his hot-blooded family Jared has sworn to wait for sex until marriage but at 29 hes having second thoughts -- and the first available female to cross his path is sister-by-adoption Nuria (Ana Ayora) who stayed behind in Colombia when Alejandro moved to the States. In the French version of such a scenario one wouldnt be surprised by the ensuing sexual antics but all that rumpy-pumpy seems rather inappropriate in the remakes upper-crust East Coast milieu. Presenting De Niros character as a recovering-alcoholic sculptor only goes so far to explain his licentious nature He turns up drunk in one scene reveals all the family secrets and then sobers up immediately. Otherwise hes the pics go-to guy for delivering too-eloquent speeches which occur with regularity whenever the script requires a heart-tugging moment. Such emotional ploys come more naturally to Zackham (who hit it big with ""The Bucket List"" script) than comedy does offering a much-needed dose of charm to the otherwise formulaic festivities.

Barry Wetcher/Lionsgate hide caption toggle caption Barry Wetcher/Lionsgate The Big Wedding Director Justin Zackham Genre Comedy Running Time 90 minutes Rated R for language sexual content and brief nudity With Robert De Niro Katherine Heigl Diane Keaton Topher Grace Watch A Clip From The Big Wedding - Well I Dont Really Care About You Well I Dont Really Care About You Credit Lionsgate If anything the title of The Big Wedding feels like an understatement. The wedding that gives the film its climactic setting is outsize to be sure but then so is everything about this overstuffed farce. Written and directed by Justin Zackham and adapted from the 2006 French film Mon Frere Se Marie -- translation My Brother Is Getting Married -- this comedy sports a huge cast jokes broad as beams and a plot thats a swollen knot of intertwined lives. That Zackham squeezes it all into a 90-minute running time would count as a feat if all that bigness didnt surround a hollow core. Zackham is best known for writing The Bucket List the Rob Reiner-directed 2007 comedy in which Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman played terminally ill pals determined to make the most of the time left to them. Despite its gimmicky premise that film largely worked thanks to the heartfelt thoughtfully written exchanges between the two protagonists. Theres scarcely a comparable moment here however. The quiet moments feel just as contrived as the manic flailing that repeatedly sends characters tumbling into swimming pools and other bodies of water. i Don (Robert De Niro) and Ellie (Diane Keaton) havent seen each other for years but they pretend to be married to celebrate their adopted sons wedding. Barry Wetcher/Lionsgate hide caption toggle caption Barry Wetcher/Lionsgate Don (Robert De Niro) and Ellie (Diane Keaton) havent seen each other for years but they pretend to be married to celebrate their adopted sons wedding. Barry Wetcher/Lionsgate Robert De Niro plays Don the first to take an unwilling dive. A sculptor of some repute hes semi-estranged from his daughter Lyla (Katherine Heigl) a lawyer on the outs with her boyfriend; relatively tight with his son Jared (Topher Grace) a doctor whos holding onto his virginity until he meets the right woman; and downright chummy with his adopted son Alejandro (Ben Barnes). So chummy in fact that Don agrees to pretend for the sake of Alejandros devout Colombian birth mother Madonna (Patricia Rae) that hes still married to Alejandros adoptive mother Ellie (Diane Keaton) despite having not seen her for a decade -- and never mind that hes long since settled into a relationship with Ellies best friend Bebe (Susan Sarandon). Also on hand Robin Williams as Father Moinighan a Catholic priest who knows Don from AA; Amanda Seyfried as Missy Alejandros bride-to-be; and Ana Aroya as Nuria Madonnas sexually liberated daughter. With so many wheels spinning at once theres scarcely room for anyone to give their characters much depth -- and with a script that treats a covert (and seemingly endless) dinner-table hand job as the height of naughty wit no one has much motivation to try. So they lean instead on their worst tendencies or their pre-baked personas -- De Niro overplays turning his character into an unlikable boor; Heigl is brittle and icy; Keaton flighty but wise -- and so on. Its all a bit exhausting made all the more so by preordained romantic pairings and other broadly telegraphed turns in the plot. (Despite a bit more connective tissue between characters its of a piece with recent megacomedies like New Years Eve -- films that seem to believe shoving a handful of well-worn plots into one movie will leave viewers feeling as if theyve gotten a bargain.) Everyone does his own thing and as with The Big Weddings poster they feel Photoshopped into place without any real sense of cohesion. Apart from a few moments that capture the spiraling chaos unresolved crises and long-simmering resentments of a large family gathering Zackhams film feels as plastic as a cake topper -- and just as hard to digest.

"The Big Wedding should have been called off - Movies - Boston.com Sites V ^ Boston.com BDCwire Love Letters Real Estate Menu Login Search Search Home News Weather Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Travel Cars Real Estate The Big Wedding should have been called off Share Tweet This is a test player. Share Tweet By Tom Russo Globe Correspondent | 04.25.13 | 302 PM Quaint and crass get together -- or would that be ""bump uglies""? -- with awkward thoroughly flat results in ""The Big Wedding"" an ensemble comedy with a tonal cluelessness as surprising as the name cast that signed on for it anyway. Adapted by writer-director Justin Zackham from the French import ""Mon frere se marie"" the film stars Robert De Niro and Diane Keaton as Don and Ellie a long-divorced couple whose reunion is well a farce. As everyone gathers for the marriage of the couples adopted son Alejandro (Ben Barnes ""The Chronicles of Narnia"") they encounter a snag. Alejandros biological mom (Patricia Rae) is on the way from Colombia and it turns out that she has a contrived pathologically traditional objection to divorce. What to do what to do? Don and Ellie reluctantly decide to pretend theyre still married -- an idea that go figure doesnt sit well with Bebe (Susan Sarandon) the free spirit whom lusty Don left Ellie for years ago. Related Link Find showtimes and theaters This being a ""big"" wedding of course the story spoons out plenty more rom-com fluff. Topher Grace plays adoptive brother Jared a 29-year-old doctor who for no discernible reason is still a virgin but whos ready to lose it with Alejandros flirty biological sister (Ana Ayora). Katherine Heigl makes the requisite showing as adoptive sister Lyla bravely smiling through fertility issues. Alejandro fiancee Missy (Amanda Seyfried) and the fam have to deal with Father Moinighan (Robin Williams refreshingly playing this as black comedy) a priest who dourly paints Pre-Cana couples as sinners on the fast track to hell. And what do you know maybe Ellie and Don still have a fleeting thing for each other after all. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below An opening in-flagrante moment with De Niro Sarandon and Keaton makes us cringe but its novel enough that were receptive to more OK theyre out to take risks -- maybe this will all click better as it goes settle into an ""Ill have what shes having"" groove. Instead Zackham (writer of ""The Bucket List"") just keeps the unfortunate ""ick"" elicitors coming seemingly convinced this passes for riotously grown-up wit. The group sits down for a fancy restaurant dinner and promptly starts chatting -- doesnt every family? -- about Ellies recent nine-hour tantric orgasm. (Hence Dons rekindled interest not coincidentally.) And at church Ellie grouses that shell take confession when pigs fly out of her . . . oh suffice it to say that even pervy old Don starts grumbling about images he could do without. Us too.

The brutally unfunny cringe-worthy ""The Big Wedding provides ample opportunities for Robert De Niro Diane Keaton Susan Sarandon and Robin Williams to embarrass themselves. To be fair theyre repeatedly enabled by writer-director Justin Zackham who borrows a tortured premise from a French farce and embellishes it with bizarre plot turns to the point where the actors stereotypical characters bear only the most fleeting resemblance to actual human beings. A randy recovering alcoholic sculptor De Niros character is first seen preparing to perform oral sex on his longtime live-in girlfriend Sarandon. This is mercifully interrupted by the arrival of his ex-wife (Keaton) who has returns to the family manse in Connecticut for the impending nuptials of their adopted youngest son (Ben Barnes) to Amanda Seyfried. But the surprise arrival of Barnes birth mother (Patricia Rae) from Colombia -- prompts the son to beg his parents to pretend theyre still married. This is for the sake of the purportedly devout Catholic mother since he never told Mama his parents were divorced. Still with me? As if that wasnt dysfunctional enough weve got a subplot starring the dread Katherine Heigl as De Niro and Keatons daughter freshly separated from her husband after a lengthy course of in vitro fertilization. The even more underemployed Topher Grace also gets to cash a paycheck as their older son a 29-year-old virgin and obstetrician who instantly falls in love with his adopted brother Barnes skinny-dipping sexpot sister (Ana Ayora) And then theres the brides parents a stockbroker whos being investigated for fraud (David Rasche) and his wife (Christine Ebersole) who -- no you wouldnt believe me in a million years. Williams is the wacky priest who presides over the wedding ceremony -- but even he cant wring any laughs out of whats probably the first-ever montage set in a church confessional (De Niro cracks a joke about Oscar Wilde ""making whoopee with altar boys""). Does De Niros character fall off the wagon? Will he and Keaton end up in bed together? Does Heigls character who in one scene throws up on De Niro have an announcement of her own? No points for guessing the right answer. ""Id rather gouge my eyes out with hot spoons De Niro exclaims at one point. Im not sure exactly what he was talking about but Id like to think it referred to the prospect of being forced to watch ""The Big Wedding.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Its almost impressive how the moronic new ensemble comedy The Big Wedding manages to cram three hours worth of nonsensical subplots extraneous characters and implausible plot points into 90 minutes of streamlined idiocy. The film suffers rather than benefits from an all-star cast which must be serviced with story arcs that run the gamut from passable to insulting. The Big Weddings most ridiculous plot-strand involves doctor Topher Grace holding onto his virginity as he approaches 30 out of an exceedingly fuzzy desire to lose it in a meaningful way  possibly on a beach at sunset. But when a characters defining characteristic is his unconvincing inexplicable virginity he probably shouldnt saunter through the film in what looks like a post-coital haze as Graces handsome confident wisecracking professional does here. Still its almost unfair to single him out since nothing in The Big Wedding rings remotely true. The eternally slumming Robert De Niro stars as a successful sculptor blessed with a rich complicated romantic history. His Colombian-born adopted son is marrying Amanda Seyfried and the grooms biological mother is flying to the States for the wedding. Out of deference to her fierce Catholic convictions and rigid sense of propriety De Niro pretends to still be married to ex-wife Diane Keaton when hes actually in a long-term relationship with Susan Sarandon Keatons former best friend. This leads to slapstick shenanigans executed at a leisurely pace. Meanwhile shrill unpleasant daughter Katherine Heigl arrives at the festivities with baggage and relationship problems of her own in a subplot that feels hastily shoehorned into the proceedings. The treatment of the grooms mother is particularly condescending Shes provided a religion and a nationality rather than a character to play. The Big Wedding is a remake of a French comedy and it would probably play better as a randy rapid-fire door-slamming farce. Instead the film moves at a poky pace that highlights its phoniness and the hammy desperation of the poorly choreographed physical comedy. De Niros horny sensualist is smacked repeatedly and vomited upon and even endures a pratfall while attempting to perform cunnilingus on Sarandon. Such slapstick humiliations are more suitable to a pie-fucking teenager in a sex comedy than a giant of American film. De Niro has once again lent his name and tarnished-but-still-formidable legacy to a pandering lowbrow comedy thats all empty artifice and cynical calculation.

Christine Ebersole Robert De Niro Diane Keaton Ana Ayora Patricia Rae and Katherine Heigl. (Barry Wetcher) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday April 25 2013 1228 PM Title The Big Wedding Film Info R Sexuality nudity. Area theaters. Movie-family weddings are like real ones. Some faces are welcome some you dread and others have had work done. But they all get tiresome quickly. Thats ""The Big Wedding"" in a nutshell. The fact that this awful ensemble comedy -- a remake of a French farce which is one of the most dreaded phrases in the Hollywood lexicon -- is still standing after an hour and a half is only because of the charisma of a few of its cast members. Yet by the end no one is spared from the forced-smile syndrome in its DNA. Robert De Niro and Diane Keaton are Don and Ellie divorced Connecticut swells whose marriage fell apart a decade earlier. Hes a lovable libidinous architect and shes well Diane Keaton. Hes now with Bebe (Susan Sarandon) but the former couple reconnect because Alejandro (Ben Barnes) the son they adopted 20 years earlier is marrying his sweetheart Missy (Amanda Seyfried). Alejandros strict religious birth mother (Patricia Rae) is coming from Colombia to attend but Alejandro fears Don and Ellies divorce will horrify her. So they fake being together for him. Their older kids Jared (Topher Grace) and Lyla (Katherine Heigl) love their adopted brother so they play along despite their own issues. Jared is a 30-year-old virgin and Lylas marriage is in a rough patch because she has been unable to have kids. (She also never stopped blaming her dad for busting up the family.) Luckily Alejandros hot sister (Ana Ayora) from South America immediately tries to seduce Jared and Lyla reveals shes what do you know pregnant. But poor Bebe has to pretend to be the caterer as a wry priest (Robin Williams) counsels them all. Alejandro (Ben Barnes) and Missy (Amanda Seyfried) are the couple getting married in The Big Wedding. (Barry Wetcher) When Robin Williams is the most understated thing in a comedy something is off. But his turn as a post-AA clergyman is down-to-earth compared to all the hyper shenanigans in writer-director Justin Zackhams laugh-free flick. Keaton and De Niro know the routine and old pros that they are twinkle and purr past the messy script. Sarandon hasnt much to do besides fiery-tempered redhead cliches and Grace who lost footing after underappreciated work in ""In Good Company"" keeps things loose but seems out of place. Heigl on the other hand is an old hand at movies like this yet still tries too hard; shes grating needy and aloof all at once. Seyfried disappears demurely into the background and Barnes neutered-male ingenue act makes him blend in with the Sarandon characters pack of pug dogs. Christine Ebersole camps it up as the vapid mother of the bride while sexy newcomer Ayora ought to have looked more closely at how demeaning her role is. But ""The Big Wedding"" lets them all down with bottom-rung sitcom shtick and an undercurrent of squareness masquerading as absurdity. This is the kind of movie in which older people act like teens women faint at the sight of babies rehearsal dinners are overly wacky and people skinny-dip out of the blue. Forget the priest someone call an exorcist.

"The Big Wedding movie review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Big Wedding parts far greater than its whole  The Big Wedding Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune The diversions in the ensemble comedy ""The Big Wedding"" (that title flat enough for you?) are strictly actor-related which is usually the case at the movies. For example the way Diane Keaton selects an asparagus spear at a country club buffet while delivering some dutiful expositional something or other. Or the rumpled panache with which Robert De Niro playing the Keaton characters ex-husband adapts to a different sort of role than hes used to playing that of the unreliable horndog trying to get by on charm.The movies own brand of charm has its subset of smarm. Part bedroom farce part heart-tugging familial dysfunction ""The Big Wedding"" was adapted by writer-director Justin Zackham from the 2006 French-Swiss co-production ""Mon Frere se Marie."" In the original a well-to-do Swiss couples adopted Vietnamese son is readying a marriage. The sons birth mother long out of the picture travels to reunite with young Vinh for the wedding. Cultural differences and narrative circumstances require Vinhs adoptive parents long divorced to fake that theyre still together.Some aspects of the earlier film remain; others have been changed or added. In ""The Big Wedding"" De Niros Philip Rothesque sculptor character is living with a caterer (Susan Sarandon) a longtime family friend. The adopted Colombian-born son Alejandro (Ben Barnes) has two siblings the now-grown children born to De Niros character and Keatons. The daughter (Katherine Heigl) has a secret though the first sign of flulike symptoms gives it away; the son (Topher Grace) a 29-year-old virgin ready for love takes one look at Alejandros visiting birth sister (Ana Ayora) and thinks well it wouldnt quite be incestuous if ... ; meanwhile everyones dithering over the quietly fearsome Catholic presence of Alejandros mom. This is an American movie trying strenuously to ""swing"" a little. The slapstick is broad and generally awkward. Five minutes into the picture Keaton stumbles upon De Niro and Sarandon in a sex act in the kitchen and its like Whoa. Have we met? Could we get another 10 minutes of setup please? ""Hyde Park on Hudson"" made a similar mistake and never quite recovered.What makes it passably entertaining is the interaction between the stars usually when the pressure to ""deliver"" is off and the banter sticks to a confidential key. Like ""La Cage aux Folles"" ""The Big Wedding"" preaches tolerance and understanding. Its too early to say if director Zackham has real talent beyond that for assembling an impressive cast. The surest thing that can be said of ""The Big Wedding"" is that youve seen worse ensemble wedding comedies. But for the record ""Jumping the Broom"" was a lot better.mjphillipstribune.comBig Wedding -- 2 starsMPAA rating R (for language sexual content and brief nudity)Running time 130Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Marriage Family Weddings Entertainment The Big Wedding (movie) Hyde Park on Hudson (movie) Ben Barnes Who are the early Oscars 2014 favorites?

This years version of ""Country Strong"" another film that bewildered simply as a matter of doing business a bad idea that somehow everyone fully committed to throughout to the films credit ... and detriment. ""The Big Wedding"" is the rare example of a film that had to have been a tonal mystery to everyone involved for the entire process of scripting shooting and editing. The lingering issue? They never managed to crack the case. ""The Big Wedding"" starts off wrong-footed from the get-go murdering any potential momentum. A lady character is introduced she has nausea and doesnt drink (could be pregnant what??) then we get to hear about a 29-year-old virgin a storyline implausible enough to be ripped from a sketch comedy exercise where the people on stage have to work with a word the audience has thrown out. ""Virgin"" Umm okay I guess well muddle through this but cmon who are we kidding here? Its impossible to do this with any element of comedic timing because theres no comedy left to wring out of the lifeless trope. But Ive already fast-forwarded too far into the piece because the actual very first scene is a voiceover from Robert DeNiro. Its gonna be a bumpy night. ""The Big Wedding"" is incredibly raunchy. I deliberately avoid the word ""bawdy"" because that description evokes the connotation that theres something adult or artsy happening here ""Moulin Rouge"" style but this is not at all the case. Ten F-Bombs (I counted Because what else was I supposed to be doing?) are sprinkled throughout the film including amazing sentences constructed completely around curse words in rapid succession the sort of dialogue you dont see much outside of the long-haul truck industry. This wouldnt be so out of place if this wasnt a movie bathed in the luminous bright lights and sentimentality of wedding tradition. Where the expectation is something along the lines of ""Rachel Getting Married"" or ""Four Weddings and Funeral"" the actuality is more akin to ""American Pie"" meets ""As Good as it Gets"" mixed with a dash of ""Just Go with It"". If those descriptors seem disparate or off-kilter thats precisely what ""The Big Wedding"" is a bit like walking in on your parents wearing swim caps rocking out to this anthem in their bedroom Now then its not as though agism is the watchword of the day or that older folks shouldnt have active and vibrant sex lives its more that Im not sure why any of this is happening at all - themes and scenes are thrown around willy nilly as if ""The Big Wedding"" can fluidly switch between genres without a structural collapse rampant sexuality painted against a backdrop of familial love and understanding personal growth attained on the back of jokes about acts of oral pleasure. Confounding this is ""The Big Wedding"". It is a shocker that it was even made and a bigger shock that anyone involved could have thought ""nailed it"" Something was nailed but ""it"" was awkwardness and confusion not narrative. As to that narrative for the morbidly curious here you are The adopted son of divorced couple Don and Ellie Alejandro (Ben Barnes) is to be married over the weekend. Divorcee Dons new squeeze is Bebe though Ellie and Bebe clearly have a previous fondness for each other. Lyla (Katherine Heigl) and Jared (Topher Grace) are Don and Ellies other children also scheduled to attend the wedding. Father Moinighan (Robin Williams) is there to provide counsel to the new couple. Alejandros fiancee is named Missy (Amanda Seyfried) and her parents are super racist they dont want her to marry Alejandro because he is not lily white. This amazingly is not the problem that needs to be dealt with. The real problem is Alejandros biological mother Madonna (Patricia Rae) is coming into town to see her only son get married only as a devout Catholic she frowns greatly upon divorce. Thus long-divorced couple Don and Ellie must pretend they are married for the sake of Alejandro to the great chagrin of current beau Bebe all while Lyla and Jared deal with various issues ranging from breakups to trying to hook up with Alejandros biological sister Nuria (Ana Ayora) though of course technically speaking Jared would then be pursuing the sister of his brother. Ahem. Weird subplots aside the ""lets pretend to be something so as not to offend someone"" plot-line was first discovered by the Incas and youve probably also seen it in works ranging from Shakespeare to Archie Comics. No its not the most innovative plot device though everything they put around the device is innovative but only in that its impossible to figure out what is happening as if youre watching the manic fight scene from ""Crazy Stupid Love"" for an entire movie. Dings firmly in mind silly cursing juxtaposed against ""I love you speeches"" and Topher Grace pining for carnal knowledge what made the film interesting and perhaps gulp worth a watch (if youre the intrepid sort of cinematic fan who occasionally doses him or herself with pain)? The list starts and almost ends with Susan Sarandon shes the primary reason any of this works on some level. Conversely Diane Keatons character Ellie is really just her Diane Keatoning all over the place. Same goes for Robert DeNiro who stars as Robert DeNiro though everyone onscreen calls him Don for some odd reason. Admittedly Susan Sarandon may be pulling off the same thing dipping into her inherent mutable loveliness but without the believability Sarandon brings to the wobbly material this would have been a laugh out loud endeavor only for all the wrong reasons. Sarandon is asked to play a husband-stealer a stepmom a best friend an embattled and bitter girlfriend waiting for her man to put a ring on it a caterer and finally mercifully a forgiving angel. This obviously should be impossible but like a jungle cat moonwalking through a fiery hoop she manages to pull it off. Any rational person would have bet against efficacy given those long odds but thats why we play the games eh? It should also be ceded that all of the actors involved tried extremely hard Katherine Heigl (as Lyla) is likable for the first time in years Amanda Seyfried continues her dogged pursuit for the title of Americas Sweetheart and Robin Williams tones it down enough to be palatable in his limited role as Father Moinighan though by my count this is the 77th time hes appeared as the wacky yet gentle preacher type. Hell even Topher Graces nod toward the impossible virgin stereotype is filled with something approximating heart though its mostly the type of heart you see filtered through a seven-layer cornball bean dip. Still everyone was up for it wackadoo lines were delivered with precision and many of the scenes feature something memorable (if not exactly coherent). Whats it all add up to? Whats the final verdict on a film thats too busy twitching in the corner for any real level of introspection? Well If you placed a rabid raccoon into a sleeping cat and then hit the fire alarm youd capture the vibe of ""The Big Wedding"". Its a film without any true concept of what it is or what it was trying to accomplish. Grade 5.5 / 10 Laremy wrote the book on film criticism and took an awful long time thinking up that cat/raccoon analogy.
