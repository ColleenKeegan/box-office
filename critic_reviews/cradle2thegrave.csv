Reteaming director Andrzej Bartkowiak with Jet Li and rapper DMX pic muddies the formula with some preposterous final-act developments but it produces sustained kick-butt action. In ""Cradle 2 the Grave"" producer Joel Silver returns with gusto to the mix of martial arts action and urban attitude that proved so commercially potent in ""Romeo Must Die."" Reteaming director Andrzej Bartkowiak with Jet Li and rapper DMX -- whos graduated from the supporting ranks to co-star with the Hong Kong dynamo -- the new vehicle muddies the formula with some preposterous final-act developments concerning world domination that might have been more at home in the 007 realm. Nonetheless pics sustained rush of kick-butt fight action and vehicular chases spiked with the usual hip-hop/techno soundtrack should lure young male audiences in droves spelling high-octane B.O. and stellar DVD prospects for the Warner Bros. release. During a stylish laser-beam title sequence the sharply executed opening tracks the moves of master thief Tony Fait (DMX) and his crew as they break in via subway tunnels and underground passages to a high-security jewelry exchange. Meanwhile Taiwanese intelligence agent Su (Li) shimmies down the outer wall of a high-rise and bitchslaps Faits contact into submission extracting details of the score and calling cops to intervene. But after a hair-raising exit on the roof of a moving subway car Fait and comely accomplice Daria (Gabrielle Union) make off with a bag of black diamonds. Fait leaves the stones with his fence Archie (Tom Arnold) to establish their value. But when word gets out bad-ass crimelord and VIP prison inmate (Chi McBride) sends his stooges on the outside to swipe the stash later revealed to be far more valuable than mere diamonds. After initially clashing Fait and Su are forced by circumstance to team up when the latters childhood friend and former government agent-gone-bad Ling (Mark Dacascos) starts pursuing the stones kidnapping Faits 8-year-old daughter (Paige Hurd) for leverage. En route to the final face-off Bartkowiak and screenwriters John OBrien and Channing Gibson keep the downtime to a minimum juicing the action with a high-speed chase through the L.A. streets led by Fait and most entertainingly a WWF-style bout in a fight club that pits Su against a cageful of angry Neanderthals. Choreographed by long-term Li collaborator Corey Yuen the martial arts confrontations supply plenty of spark though they lack the more exhilarating stylistic flourishes of those in ""Romeo."" Where the film veers off the rails is in revelations regarding the true properties of the black diamonds demonstrated by Ling with the aid of a laser oscillator before an ethnically mixed bunch of upscale sleazebags identified as the worlds foremost arms dealers. These arch scenes cry out for Dr. Evil. However the setup segues confidently to a triple-clash climax intercutting between three mano-a-mano fights respectively involving Su Fait and Daria the latter in some girl-on-girl action against Lings sexy sidekick Sona (Kelly Hu). Editor Derek G. Brechin who cut ""Romeo"" and subsequent Silver-Bartkowiak-DMX collaboration ""Exit Wounds"" keeps things humming along. This and Daryn Okadas muscular extremely agile and angular camerawork help pump the action and camouflage weaknesses such as the absence of a more memorable villain or lack of definition in the relationship between Fait and Daria. While Li continues to show little development as an English-language actor in his scant dialogue scenes the stars precision foot- and fist-work remain superlative barely breaking a sweat or altering his stoic expression as he flattens a series of adversaries. And while DMX is no match in the fight department the hip-hop star registers with a cool commanding presence the chemistry between the two oddly matched leads proving more than serviceable. Continuing the trend in Silver actioners to develop black characters that break the standard gangsta mold Fait is a ""good"" criminal a devoted loving father operating with a no-guns policy and reminding his crew theyre stealing from pimps and drug-runners. Union looks alluring but is underused. Comic relief again is provided by Anthony Anderson as Faits crew-member Tommy particularly in a scene in which he uses his motor-mouth charms to distract a gay security guard. Repeating the device from ""Exit Wounds"" Anderson and Arnold amusingly riff on the end credits about writing and casting their own action film based on the characters experiences.

Its just a guess but maybe this is because the movie features Jet Li DMX and Tom Arnold. Each actor does his own thing for his own audience demographic as Cradles characters pursue coveted black diamonds that look something like oversized Chiclets. And though Deliver Us From Evas Gabrielle Union also is around for the demographic that enjoys seeing semi-unclad lookers there will still be a lot of ""deliver us from"" reaction to the movie. Review of the movie Cradle 2 the Grave ( out of four) StarsJet Li DMX Gabrielle Union Anthony Anderson Tom Arnold Director Andrezj Bartkowiak Distributor Warner Bros. Rating R for violence language and some sexual content Opens today nationwide It begins with a heist of the diamonds by a crew that includes lieutenant Union in low-cut bared-navel garb. This is in contrast to boss DMXs look shaved head an ear jewel and a gaudy necklace that looks as if it could pick up broadcasts of sandlot baseball games from Radio Havana. But these baddies are only half-baddies. DMX adores his young daughter during a scene of bedtime story and prayer that doesnt exactly play to his acting strengths. As a result rival total-baddies kidnap the child to exchange for the gems which have uh nuclear capabilities. This aligns the half-baddies with Jet Lis Taiwanese government agent who in one scene tosses a Mini-me look-alike midget into a horizontal line of assailants. Well its a living. The director is former cinematographer Andrzej Bartkowiak who once shot movies such as The Verdict Terms of Endearment and Speed. Distributor Warner Bros. now has another numerically cutesy title in the works with Scooby-Doo Too. If youre a mortgage-paying grown-up it seems like an eternity since most of the studios output stopped being 4-U.

PHOTOGRAPHS TO BE USED SOLELY FOR ADVERTISING PROMOTION PUBLICITY OR REVIEWS OF THIS SPECIFIC MOTION PICTURE ... more Photo Claudette Barius Cradle doesnt exactly rock / DMXs serviceable kung-fu thriller specializes in overkill 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Cradle 2 the Grave Action thriller. Starring DMX Jet Li and Tom Arnold. Directed by Andrzej Bartkowiak. Written by Channing Gibson. (R. 101 minutes. At Loews Metreon UA Alexandria AMC 1000 AMC Kabuki Century Plaza 10 in South San Francisco Century 20 in Daly City.) The toughest stunt in this action thriller isnt the motorcycle jump off the roof or the fingertip hang from the roof of the speeding train. It isnt even the exploding fireballs. Its keeping a straight face. Rapper DMX and company struggle to maintain a glowering urban demeanor to match his menacing soundtrack in ""Cradle 2 the Grave."" But between the off- center comic riffs of Tom Arnold and the wildly improbable hairs-breadth escapes the whole business dissolves into amiable action farce. When a characters helicopter is hit by a cannon shell spins into an airport hangar and erupts in flames -- and the next thing we see is him stepping out the helicopter door without a scratch -- we realize that were not exactly seeing the first 12 minutes of ""Saving Private Ryan."" Thats not a bad thing. Although the pumped-up trailers and ads make this look gritty and grim its a perfectly serviceable mindless action film. The plot something about stealing black diamonds to save the world makes no more sense than the films title. (Theres not a cradle or a grave in the whole show.) But the basics are there. The bad guys are deeply evil the kung fu is fast and furious and our heroes live by a strict code of conduct. Fait (DMX) is the mastermind of a ring of high-tech thieves. Fait and his merry band -- the funny one the sexy one and ""the kid"" -- live in classy luxury from their spoils. But dont worry they are still good guys. As they are cleaning precious gems out of a vault Fait explains that the loot is owned by drug dealers and money launderers. So they are actually doing society a favor. The guy you come to see is martial arts hottie Jet Li who plays the mysterious Su. Li has some cool scenes and some moves that jump right off the screen. But director Andrzej Bartkowiak is definitely not from the less-is- more school. Li enters one of those ""ultimate warrior"" fights and knocks off everyone. But the scene goes on and on with more goons coming out of the woodwork. Eventually crotch-kicking fatigue sets in. Thats kind of the problem with the whole production. At one point Fait rides a souped-up all-terrain vehicle up a stairwell. With a motorcyclist in hot pursuit he goes up a flight of stairs and sails into the air. Then they do the next flight. And the next. OK guys we get it. Overkill is why this seems to drag on in the middle. With a little editing you could have a ""XXX"" or ""The Fast and the Furious."" Instead it veers perilously close to the campy contrivance of James Bond. It should be said however that the supporting cast is terrific. Watch for ""Boston Publics"" Chi McBride. The morally upright principal from the Fox TV show has a ball playing against type as a crime lord. In addition Anthony Anderson (Tommy) shows that if he can avoid any more loser projects like ""Kangaroo Jack"" he is going to go big. But the shocker is Arnold. Although it is difficult to imagine as the oddball character Archie Arnold steals every scene. Hes fast funny and a little disturbing. If only the film could say the same. . This film contains graphic violence raw language and nudity.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr B- Cradle 2 the Grave Genre Mystery and Thriller Action/Adventure; Starring DMX Jet Li Anthony Anderson Tom Arnold Mark Dacascos Kelly Hu Gabrielle Union; Director Andrzej Bartkowiak; Author Channing Gibson; Producer (person) Joel Silver; Release Date Wide 02/28/2003; Runtime (in minutes) 100; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted February 26 2003 -- 1200 AM EST During one of the many street fights in Cradle 2 the Grave a thug shoves a gun in the face of principled thief Tony Fait (DMX) and demands a trove of mysterious stolen gems. ""Im a businessman"" Fait snaps indignantly. ""Make me a f--in offer"" You dont really believe that Faits going to die of course. But the film makes it clear that this outraged appeal to protocol is the last card he has to play. DMX delivers the line with unironic fire which is how he delivers every line in ""Cradle."" Hes not what youd call a good actor - hes not even what youd call an actor - but under the tutelage of producer Joel Silver and director Andrzej Bartkowiak (who worked with the rapper on the tonally identical ""Romeo Must Die"" and ""Exit Wounds"") hes shaping himself into a genuinely appealing screen presence a sort of gangsta-preneur samurai. With a code of honor and a kidnapped daughter his Fait is as earnest and yes grave as the movie is pleasantly cliched in its perfunctory but well-executed action sequences. (An all-terrain vehicle placed with Chekhovian precision outside a bordello will inevitably be used in an ""extreme"" chase scene by the third act.) Of course theres another samurai in ""Cradle"" Su (Jet Li) the one spook a meagerly populated country like Taiwan can spare to recover its superimportant government loot - the same precious gemstones which are actually crystalline plutonium. In whats almost a separate film Li - refreshingly unfettered by the overdone computer effects that marred his performance in ""Romeo"" - brutalizes enemy upon enemy with chill dispatch and increasingly baroque gore weaponizing everything around him from his jacket collar to an unlucky dwarf. Hes the aloof yin to DMXs impassioned yang. By the time Li enters the obligatory ""ring of fire"" to face his final opponent you realize just how forthrightly rote and businesslike ""Cradle"" is. And you dont mind. Because business it turns out is good.
