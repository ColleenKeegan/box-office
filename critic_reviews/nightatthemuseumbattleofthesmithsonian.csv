By David Denby A longing for adventure motivates the new animated feature from Pixar.   Credit Illustration by Bob Staake The recent animated features by the Pixar division of Disney--""The Incredibles"" ""Ratatouille"" ""WALL-E"" and now ""Up""--have amounted to a run of creative success that has few parallels in American popular culture. Yes there was the classic Disney group of animated features released between 1937 and 1942 which included ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" ""Pinocchio"" ""Bambi"" and ""Dumbo."" Children still love them though this aging child doesnt really. The old Disney dispensation went roughly as follows The material was largely based on fairy tales with princes and queens and wicked stepmothers. Animals with long eyelashes engaged in gentle woodland conversation. There was much anthropomorphic charm much sweet melodiousness and running through the sugar a vinegary taste of fear separation punishment. The entire Bruno Bettelheim catalogue of psychological terrors churned below the surface. By now (for me at least) the cloyingness with its malevolent undertones seems too calculated and heavy-spirited. But the recent Pixar films are something else. These movies are fashioned as much for adults as for kids. Set in the modern world they are built around an exhilarating drive for achievement. A family of libertarian superheroes refuses to accept enforced mediocrity (""The Incredibles""). A talented rat wants to practice the art of cooking (""Ratatouille""). A robot saves the aesthetic remnants of a civilization ruined by excess and pollution (""WALL-E""). Some of the characters are isolated; they are all intelligent and strongly motivated. Weve gone from psychological fable to moral fable from fate to something like self-willed even civic passion. ""Up"" which begins in the nineteen-thirties is steeped in the style of that period with its gee-whiz appreciation of exotic adventure and its worship of heroes who have journeyed to strange distant places. A little boy Carl watches newsreels at a theatre and sees an explorer Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer) first celebrated then humiliated no one believes the skeleton of a large flightless bird that Muntz has brought back from South America is authentic. When Carl leaves the theatre he imagines the newsreel narrator describing his walk home turning his stepping over a crack in the sidewalk into a vault over a canyon. Its a gracious moment the co-directors Pete Docter and Bob Peterson who also wrote the screenplay pay affectionate tribute to daydreaming as a noble and necessary human activity. In dreams begin responsibilities and in dreams begin movies too. A little tomboy Ellie (Elie Docter Petes daughter) bursts into Carls world and in a rapid wordless montage we see their long life together--wedded bliss and also painfully the slow extinction of many hopes including a desire that they too will have great adventures in South America. The marital sequence is one of the most moving animated episodes ever made. Its like looking through a family photo album and knowing that every picture represents a crucial moment of experience. The doll-like figures only increase the pathos--Ellie seen deep within the frame becomes smaller and more and more bent as she sweeps their little house. When she dies the elderly Carl now known as Mr. Frederikson (Ed Asner) is left with nothing but a scrapbook called ""My Big Adventure"" which she kept when she was young. Grouchy and cut off--the filmmakers based his snarl and snap on that of a George Booth old guy--he pretends to be more decrepit than he is. When he gets pushed too far however he revolts attaching thousands of helium balloons to his house which is about to be demolished and heads at last for South America. The house takes off but with an unwanted stowaway--a chubby little round-faced Wilderness Explorer in shorts Russell (Jordan Nagai) a version of the youthful Carl. But this boy doesnt need to dream; he just acts rolling into trouble. The never-achieved adventure begins. Carl will renew his ties with his dead wife and embrace the child they never had. ""Up"" is being distributed in both 2-D and 3-D formats. The third dimension lends the characters palpability. Carl has a square blocky head and a blocky body; the boy has a circular face with a bump for a nose. Neither of them is very big but they look solid weighted. When they reach South America they immediately stumble upon the legendary bird--a gorgeous fantasia of purple and red with an enormous beak and the flexibility of an Olympic gymnast. It turns out that Muntz has been there for years hiding out near a gigantic waterfall trying to catch the creature so that he can restore his reputation. He is aided by a pack of dogs with thick damp jowls and snouts. Except for one or two shots however Docter and Peterson never exploit the obvious 3-D opportunity of fangs snapping in the viewers face. Their use of the technology is relatively chaste; theyre not particularly eager to shock us. They keep their eyes on the story and on the bond that develops between Carl and Russell. For the filmmakers 3-D is a narrative tool which works only if what it is enhancing is strong to begin with. After chases and spills and much scurrying over bare mountain buttes an intricate fight unfolds in the sky. On one side are Carl and Russell held aloft in Carls house; on the other Muntz commanding an enormous dirigible. Russell falls out of the house and winds up clinging to some balloons and as he swings from one place to another you can feel the air around him. Airiness has become a medium to pass through not just dead space. Animation may be the perfect place for 3-D. The movie is packed with lovely jokes some of them funny in inexplicable ways. The dogs have been outfitted with little collars that turn their thoughts into words. When Russell reaches down and flips a switch on one collar a dog starts talking in Japanese or Swahili. He flips the switch again and the animal speaks at squeaky double speed like a cartoon chipmunk. The odd surprises never stop. Muntz at the helm of his dirigible is suddenly transfixed by an odd screeching sound--its Russell hanging on to his balloons and dragging his sneakers across the large windows of the airship. The moment is held for what feels like ten seconds. That annoying rubber-on-glass screech a homely sound in the midst of the wildest fantasy brings us back to the genius of the filmmakers. For all their mad inventions they never quite leave the world behind. ""Night at the Museum Battle of the Smithsonian"" is what my mother would have called a kakabarly--a large foaming broth into which she emptied the forlorn and highly miscellaneous contents of her icebox. The plot of this family comedy is nominal; its barely a premise. Ben Stiller is back with his beloved stuffed and wax figures and other statues miniatures and artifacts--only not at the American Museum of Natural History this time but in the basement of the Smithsonian complex (which includes a mockup of the National Gallery) where they have been shipped. After dark the figures come to life and the result is pretty much a free-form traffic jam in which everyone fights everyone else. There are a few fine touches in the chaos some of the paintings spill out of their frames; statues of cherubim fly about; and Stiller and Amy Adams (playing a ready-for-anything Amelia Earhart in red curls) jump into the famous Alfred Eisenstaedt photograph of a sailor kissing a nurse on V-J Day and find themselves in a period black-and-white movie. The scene doesnt mean much of anything but its a handsome piece of magic. The great Hank Azaria also deserves praise as a wannabe pharaoh Kahmunrah. Powerful arms emerging from his battle dress Azaria channelling Boris Karloff speaks in a prissy vaguely English accent and with a lisp. Kahmunrah is an exceptionally huffy wannabe. When people insist on calling his war costume a dress he becomes agitated. ""Its a tunic"" Azaria says irritably shaking his fly-whisk sceptre or nekhakha. ""Tunic."" The British director Sam Mendes (""American Beauty"" ""Road to Perdition"" ""Revolutionary Road"") has at times trapped his American characters in visual and moral schemes that hampered their freedom. In ""Away We Go"" working with a loose and colloquial script written by the husband-and-wife novelists Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida he has gone in the opposite direction Mendes now seems to be happily searching for the countrys idiosyncrasies rather than for its archetypes. The structure is open-ended ruminative rumpled almost in the manner of a road movie from the nineteen-seventies. An intelligent young couple Verona (Maya Rudolph) and Burt (John Krasinski) who are about to have their first baby dont quite know who they are or what they want so they travel around visiting friends and relatives many of whom have children. Some of the episodes are ripely satirical others almost heartbreaking. Allison Janney appears as a coarse drunk who taunts her kids; Maggie Gyllenhaal is a pushy New Age mom whose aggressive virtue saps the strength of everyone around her. The movie could be called a search for an ideal of parenthood and also for a place that the two wanderers exhausted but increasingly sure of themselves can call home.

"Night at the Museum Hank Azaria steals the show | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentNight at the Museum Hank Azaria steals the showWith the same fantasy premise an almost identical setting and many of the same characters and cast members its safe to say Night at the Museum Battle of the Smithsonian is now officially the second property in what promises to be a lucrative family-friendly franchise.Hank Azaria plays multiple characters in Night at the Museum Battle of the Smithsonian including Egyptian pharaoh Kahmunrah.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Greg QuillBooks ColumnistFri. May 22 2009Starring Ben Stiller Hank Azaria and Amy Adams. Directed by Shawn Levy. 105 minutes. At major theatres. PG With the same fantasy premise an almost identical setting many of the same characters and cast members lots of familiar high-school humour and even more frantic energy and digital animation trickery than the original its safe to say Night at the Museum Battle of the Smithsonian is now officially the second property in what promises to be a lucrative family-friendly franchise.Its a guaranteed blockbuster but that doesnt mean director Shawn Levy has done all he could have to make Museum 2 a particularly memorable comedy.He picks up three years after his runaway hit concluded with main man Larry Daley (Ben Stiller) the former night watchman at New Yorks Museum of Natural History now running a successful useless gadget enterprise manufacturing his own inventions and flogging them to the bored and gullible on TV and occasionally visiting his old playmates - the museum exhibits that come alive at sundown - for kicks. Its during one of these infrequent trips to his old workplace that the newly minted gizmo magnate learns - first from his earlier mentor Teddy Roosevelt (Robin Williams again) and the next day from museum boss Dr. McPhee (Ricky Gervais) - that many of his nocturnal buddies including the resentful miniature cowboy Jedediah Smith (Owen Wilson) Roman centurion Octavius (Steve Coogan) Indian maiden Sacajawea (Mizuo Peck) and his favourite capuchin monkey are to be crated for removal and storage in the bowels of the vast Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C.Article Continued BelowThe venerable museum Daley loves is joining the digital age and holograms and animatronics are replacing his lovable supposedly inanimate relics which will likely never again see the light of day. When Daley learns that the ancient Egyptian tablet that activates the inmates surreal after-hours life has been secreted aboard the Smithsonian-bound freight by the mischievous monkey he fears the worst a catastrophic mess of night-living exhibits in the worlds largest museum. He must intercede.Thats the set-up. The rest of the plot is standard chaos except for some astounding visual effects and a few more characters thrown into the mix. Among them is Kahmunrah (Hank Azaria) the evil brother of Museum 1s Egyptian ruler Ahkmenrah bent on unlocking the door to the Underworld.Theres pesky perky pilot Amelia Earhart (Amy Adams) and Gen. George Armstrong Custer (Bill Hader) still bleating about his defeat at Little Big Horn and longing for one more redeeming battle.Meanwhile Ivan the Terrible (Christopher Guest) Napoleon Bonaparte (Alain Chabat) and a black-and-white Al Capone (Jon Bernthal) act as Kahmunrahs three bumbling stooges while a 20-metre-tall Abe Lincoln (voiced by Azaria) as the final arbiter in the mayhem that ensues.Also along for the ride and to provide a series of sly and occasionally effective pop-culture jabs are Jonah Hill (Superbad) in a hilarious sequence as a pudgy self-important security guard Kitty Hawks flying Wright brothers Rodins Thinker who turns out to be a barely articulate moron (Azarias voice again) Darth Vader Oscar the Grouch and Eugene Levy and the Jonas Brothers voicing respectively a bobbing-head Albert Einstein doll and a trio of singing cherubim. But somehow most of the imaginative work seems have gone into the special effects - including some stunning inventions using iconic American paintings - rather than into a script that with a few exceptions falls a long way short of its comic potential.Azaria pretty much steals the show. His stint as a vengeful wannabe pharaoh with an outrageous Boris Karloff lisp and more than a hint of camp La Cage aux Folles hysteria is a hoot and worth the price of admission. But his evil companions - Ivan Napoleon and Capone - arent given a line worth a laugh. Hader as the eternally unprepared Custer makes the most of his one good line ""Were Americans. We dont plan we do"" But he is wasted in most of his scenes.Coogans big moment riding a squirrel into battle lacks the weight worthy of his talent and when in the final struggle between good and evil the movie stops while Stiller gets into a face-slapping match with a pair of monkeys its clear the makers of Museum 2 have made a conscious decision to take the low road.The one paved with gold that is.

Starring Ben Stiller Amy Adams Robin Williams Jonah Hill Bill Hader Owen Wilson Hank Azaria Ricky Gervais Steve Coogan Christopher Guest Director Shawn Levy Release Opened May 22 2009  Editorial Review Washingtonians rejoice The Smithsonian Institution gives a fantastic performance in Ben Stillers new family comedy ""Night at the Museum Battle of the Smithsonian."" Just as the original ""Night at the Museum"" reportedly increased attendance at New Yorks American Museum of Natural History this sequel should make the National Air and Space Museum an even more impenetrable mess of pint-size hordes. But parents should be happy about that. After all a couple of visits to the museums might keep them away from pedestrian movies like this one.The museum sparkles but the movie is awfully dull.Last seen wowing his son by handling the late-night shenanigans at the Museum of Natural History onetime night guard Larry Daley (Stiller) is now a CEO. On one of his visits back to the museum he learns that most of his moonlight pals -- Dexter the capuchin and belligerent tiny cowboy Jedediah (Owen Wilson) among them -- are being shipped to Washington. The movies action is mostly in the Smithsonian Castle and the Air and Space Museum. Things are fudged a bit The movies Castle and the vaults underneath are jammed with a giant octopus Rodins ""Thinker"" and ""American Gothic.""But the real problem is that Stiller underplays a little too much. Its not nearly as much fun to watch him coolly face down a dozen spear-toting warriors as it was to watch him screaming and running from a T. rex. ""Smithsonian"" is filled with cameos from beloved comedy figures given almost nothing to do Christopher Guest growls a bit as Ivan the Terrible. Ricky Gervais classes things up for five minutes then disappears. Mindy Kaling and Ed Helms hardly appear at all.Coming off much better is Amy Adams who plays irrepressible Amelia Earhart. If the producers are smart theyll sign Adams up for a spin-off posthaste.-- Dan Kois (May 22 2009)Contains mild action and brief language.

The documentary film was written and directed by Clay Tweel. Photo Open Road Films By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Updated July 30 2016 155 p.m. ET 3 COMMENTS The subject of Clay Tweels superb documentary feature is Steve Gleason the former New Orleans Saints safety who was diagnosed with ALS or Lou Gehrigs disease in 2011. Shortly afterward Mr. Gleason started chronicling the progress of his disease in a video diary but six weeks later he and his wife Michel learned she was pregnant. At that point the diary became for the most part a series of straight-to-the-camera messages to his son Rivers both before and after the birth. ""My intention"" he says at the outset when his speech is still unimpaired ""is to pass on as much of who I am as I possibly can to you."" What was meant as a gift to his son is a gift to anyone who watches the film which incorporates Mr. Gleasons home videos in a profile of almost unfathomable courage--hes still very much with us although his body has been ravaged by the disease--and a portrait of a profoundly good man. ENLARGE Michel Gleason Steve Gleason and Rivers Gleason. Photo Open Road Films ""Gleason"" is so powerful in its cumulative effect that it should be accompanied by a consumer advisory--something along the lines of ""This documentary may cause sudden alterations of mood and attitude."" I can attest to having been undone by at least one scene and Im far from an easy weeper; its a confrontation between Mr. Gleason and his own father a man with rigid notions of good and evil. The moment is at once heart-rending and transcendently beautiful and father-and-son themes play in parallel throughout the film or perhaps they intertwine in a double helix. Mr. Gleason is determined to be a better father for his son than his father was for him even though he must speak through a voice synthesizer by the time Rivers is starting to talk. More Reviews Jason Bourne Indignation Summer Movie Preview Interactive Watch trailers and read more about the summers crop of films The film is authentically inspiring but also unsparing in its depiction of the horrors of ALS and its impact on the family. (The implacable strength of Michel Gleason could be the subject of a separate film.) The disease moves swiftly attacking Steve Gleasons spirit as well as his body. There are times captured by the unblinking camera when his agonies seem unendurable yet he has rejected assisted suicide and chosen to live out a life that brings joy with the pain. In one conjunction of more emotions than can be put into words we see him struggling to breathe while he watches Rivers struggling to blow out all four candles on his birthday cake. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download The Theory of Everything (2014) Eddie Redmayne stars brilliantly as the cosmologist Stephen Hawking who at age 21 was diagnosed with a motor neuron disorder related to Lou Gehrigs disease and given two years to live. More than half a century later hes still going strong. See James Marshs movie as a companion piece to ""Gleason"" an enjoyable demonstration of the difference between nonfiction films that can enthrall and informative features that entertain. 353 Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Even Ben Stillers Larry Daley the former night guard at the museum seems to have moved on. Hes now the infomercial king hawking such wares as the Glow in the Dark Torch in excruciatingly stilted exchanges with George Foreman. But alack the willful monkey takes the tablet of Ahkmenrah with him to Washington thus potentially bringing to life the Smithsonians entire multistory subterranean warehouse of treasured antiquities and zoological oddities. (If monkeys could communicate they might have something to say about the lopsided number of screenplays predicated on the antics of miscreant simians.) Even worse Ahkmenrah has a brother the crazily dressed maniacally lisping Kahmunrah (Hank Azaria) who less loved by his parents intends to use the tablet to exact his revenge and rule the world. If Larry doesnt do something its not just his exhibitionist friends who are stuffed. (See TIMEs summer entertainment preview.) People may love whats next but the Night at the Museum movies are a big swoony smooch to the old. Amelia Earhart (Amy Adams) is our heroine full of moxie and quaint phraseology. The Tuskegee airmen face off against Ivan the Terrible Napoleon and Al Capone. Even big old marble Abe Lincoln gets to take his shot. (Hates pigeons it turns out.) But it is Daley with his superior-quality museum-guard skills who must ultimately save the day. Its amazing what you can do in the planet-saving department if you just have a uniform a pass and the right flashlight apparently. One of the most eye-opening special effects of an effects-laden movie is how it makes minimum-wage employment appear to be a rewarding and glamorous career. Nobody is going to learn from the Museum movies. Neither will anyone mistake them for the kind of sophisticated entertainment one normally finds on the Mall in the non-Capitol parts anyway. But in bringing history literally to life and having as much fun with it as it is computer-graphically possible to have director Shawn Levy and Reno 911 writers Robert Ben Garant and Thomas Lennon at least make it worth noticing. And perhaps preserving. Progress is good but as the ancient Pharaohs knew a good headdress never goes out of style. See TIMEs Pictures of the Week.

"Night at the Museum Battle of the Smithsonian | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; night-at-the-museum-battle-of-the-smithsonian ) Night at the Museum Battle of the Smithsonian (United States 2009) May 21 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli The best thing that can be said about the second Night at the Museum (which bears the unnecessarily long full title of Night at the Museum Battle of the Smithsonian) is that its harmless. And pointless. And dumb. This is a perfect example of a motion picture that exists exclusively because its predecessor made a lot of money. And like most movies that fit into that category the filmmakers have been careful not to change the formula. Keep potential viewers in their comfort zone. The hope is that those who enjoyed the first installment will appreciate the sequel. Well I didnt like the first one. So what about the bigger budgeted more hyped sequel? Well I didnt hate it. I didnt feel passionately enough about it for such a loaded description. I tolerated it and occasionally wished I was watching Star Trek on the faux IMAX screen instead. Id love to be able to write a scintillating penetrating review of Night at the Museum 2 but the truth is that I dont have much to day about the film. Why? Because theres nothing there. Nothing except special effects. The plot is laughable. There are no characters to speak of. The human actors are merely on hand to gawk at what the producers could buy for 150 million. Often bad films will inspire me to spend 800 words ripping a movie to shreds. Good movies will often move me to write with unexpected eloquence. Night at the Museum 2 made me wish Id stayed home and taken a nap. Seeing the film in IMAX helps because all those special effects are bigger. (Sadly because I saw this in a ""new IMAX"" venue they werent as big as they might have been.) But it also magnifies the productions numerous shortcomings. Why even bother with actors when computer-generated simulacrums would have been just as effective? It doesnt say a lot about a movie when the best scene is one featuring cameos by Oscar the Grouch and Darth Vader. (Vader doesnt get to speak; apparently James Earl Jones didnat need the paycheck.) So whats the story? This time the magical tablet that brings museum exhibits to life ends up at the Smithsonian. Realizing what can happen security guard-turned-inventor Larry Daley (Ben Stiller) travels from New York to D.C. to prevent disaster. Hes a little too late. The megalomaniacal Pharaoh Kahmunrah (Hank Azaria) is putting the finishing touches on his plans to take over the world and he has recruited Napoleon (Alain Chabat) a black-and-white Al Capone (Jon Bernthal) and a surprisingly spineless and tapped-out Ivan the Terrible (Christopher Guest). Of course Larry has allies as well including the miniature Jedediah (Owen Wilson) who spends most of the movie trapped in an hour glass; Amelia Earhart (Amy Adams) who becomes Larrys love interest; the Lincoln Memorials giant Honest Abe (voice of Hank Azaria); and Teddy Roosevelt (Robin Williams). The goal seems to be to defeat Kahmunrah before dawn arrives and freezes him and his minions - after that happens what fun would it be to take him down? Ben Stiller put forth some effort in the first Night at the Museum; here hes just going through the motions like almost everyone else. (That includes Jonah Hill who makes an appearance in what may represent the movies most excruciatingly annoying two minutes.) The exception is Amy Adams who believes shes in a better movie than the one she actually is participating in. Watching her bubbly performance we can occasionally imagine the same thing. Then she finishes her lines or the camera focuses on someone else and reality floods back in. I dont fault her for appearing in this movie. Hopefully the nice paycheck will enable her to continue to make the kinds of smaller quirky films that represent her specialty. I suppose kids will enjoy Night at the Museum 2; its pitched at those with approximately a first-grade education and they will likely appreciate its limited roster of laudable qualities. Adults have the choice of either admiring the scenery or taking a nap. Theres not much else worth doing. Certainly paying attention to the story is an exercise in futility but youre welcome to try...

Bill amp; Teds Excellent Adventure.Which by the way is a vastly more meaningful moviegoing experience than this knee-jerk sequel to the surprise 2006 Ben Stiller smash. A super-size rehash of the original - transplanted from New Yorks Museum of Natural History to the sprawling mall of museums run by the Smithsonian in Washington - this family-friendly vehicle once again stars Stiller as the museum guard who communes with objects and artifacts on display after the doors close for the day.Except this time as Night at the Museum - Part Duh begins Stillers Larry Daley is no longer employed as a guard. Hes a successful entrepreneur with ""Daley Devices"" infomercials to prove it. (Hot item a glow-in-the-dark flashlight.) But money isnt everything you know and Larry misses his friends like the little figurines come-to-life played by Owen Wilson (cowpoke Jedediah) and Steve Coogan (Octavius) and that reanimated statue of Rough Rider Teddy Roosevelt (Robin Williams).Then comes news that the Museum of Natural Historys exhibits are being jazzed-up and interactified and that Larrys dusty old pals are being shipped to ""deep storage"" in a subterranean archive at the Smithsonian complex. Also on the move a megalomaniacal Egyptian pharaoh (Hank Azaria) along with a trio of historic heavies - Al Capone Ivan the Terrible and Napoleon (Jon Bernthal Christopher Guest and Alain Chabat respectively). They too come alive plotting to take over the Smithsonian and then the world.Or something like that.And so Larry dashes to D.C. dons a guards uniform and starts running hither and yon - from the National Gallery to the Air and Space Museum - encountering such notables as the aforementioned 16th president (awoken from his marble slumber at the Lincoln Memorial) and the jaunty aviatrix Amelia Earhart.Its a sign of just how lackluster NATMBOTS (or nat-em-bots as we like to say) is that the heretofore irrepressibly charming Amy Adams - shes Earhart - displays all the vim and vigor of an animatronic wax figure. Spouting putatively amusing anachronisms and showing lots of ""moxie"" as she tags alongside Larry she looks hopelessly lost. As for the ""chemistry"" between Stiller and Adams (yes there are intimations of romance) - its inert.In a film rife with CG and green screen effects - and NATMBOTS is full of em - its inevitable that the actors will be caught gazing into some middle-distance as if theyre interacting with something thats not really there. Thats because all of the dinosaurs the Easter Island totems and the giant octopus with its menacing tentacles arent there - they havent been digitally inserted yet.So yes it really is pretend this business. But the problem with NATMBOTS is that Stiller Adams and company seem to be pretending that theyre having fun too.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

BOMBING SURVIVORS By Bill Hoffmann View author archive Get author RSS feed Name(required) Email(required) Comment(required) August 25 1999 | 400am Nearly half the survivors of the Oklahoma City bombing have serious mental problems - suffering from such disorders as severe depression alcoholism and drug abuse a new study shows. Researchers quizzed 182 adults who were inside or near the federal building when the bomb went off in April 1995. Forty-five percent were found to suffer from a psychiatric illness. One in three had post-traumatic-stress disorder - a condition often seen in war veterans. Its symptoms include flashbacks angry outbursts and sleep and concentration problems. Bombing survivors have described nightmares an intense fear of entering tall buildings a loss of trust and nightmarish flashbacks triggered by loud noises. ""I can still smell the smoke"" said Martin Cash a former benefits counselor with Veterans Affairs who lost an eye in the bombing. Once when his wife was moving furniture at their home she bumped the wall. ""That big thud I came unglued"" he recalled. Charlie Younger was in a business meeting on the fourth floor when the bomb went off killing 168 and wounding about 700. He hasnt been able to watch movies with scenes of violence has difficulty trusting people and dislikes tall buildings. ""Im nervous all the time especially if I cant look out a window"" he said. The study whose results appear in the new Journal of the American Medical Association was conducted by researchers at Washington University in St. Louis the Oklahoma State Department of Health and the University of Oklahoma. --- (Different version on p. 20 in the metro edition.)

And if there is one thing we can count on in this world it is that monkeys are funny. Take it from the entertainment professionals who made this film. At one point Ben Stiller (as night watchman Larry Daley) and two feisty capuchins do a Three Stooges face-slapping routine that runs as I recall about 35 minutes. One monkey slaps Larry. The other monkey slaps Larry. Larry slaps both monkeys. Which is pretty funny. But not nearly as funny as when they do it again. And again. And again and again and again and again. The first ""Night at the Museum"" had Stiller in a slap-fight with a single monkey so this is definitely twice as funny. If youre 9. The jokes and puns on display here are older than the mastodons in the diorama but does that really matter? Kids will love it just as they love lukewarm pizza stale cola and soggy French fries. Adults drawn to the film by its superlative cast -- Ricky Gervais Christopher Guest Hank Azaria and Steve Coogan to name a few -- will find it disappointingly light in the laughs department. You watch it wondering why the studio didnt release the outtakes theatrically and make the film a bonus feature on the DVD. The sequel to the big family hit ""Night at the Museum"" struggles with a big creative challenge. The sense of wonderment you feel in seeing museum displays magically come to life is not as strong the second time around. If youve seen one playful T. rex skeleton youve seen them all. Larry isnt surprised by the displays nocturnal antics anymore; how could we be? The solution offered here is to move the action from New Yorks Museum of Natural History to the Smithsonian the worlds largest collection of art and antiquities -- more displays more artifacts to bring to life. NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM THE BATTLE OF THE SMITHSONIAN  1/2 out of 4 stars  Rating PG for mild action and brief language. This approach introduces Guest as Ivan the Terrible Azaria as a nasty pharaoh and Amy Adams as spunky flier Amelia Earhart but makes the film too busy with too many characters and too much going on. Its action-packed colorful and visually diverting but not that much fun. If a fraction of the ingenuity that went into the computer graphics had been directed to the script the film could have been a delight. Instead the story is the captive of the effects. Al Capone and a couple of hoods show up not because they have anything compelling to contribute but because the technicians figured out a way to render them in black and white alongside characters in color. There are moments amid the special effects excess to be sure. Azarias lisping Egyptian is a silly tribute to Boris Karloff the movies original Mummy. Azaria throws himself into the peevish role with such gusto that his commitment becomes a joke in itself. Gervais steals his scenes as an overbearing museum curator but his cameo highlights how flabby and lifeless the bulk of the film is. If you have children to baby-sit you could do worse but the people who made the film could have done much better.

Museum guard Larry Daley (Ben Stiller) searches for ""true happiness"" amid chaos in Night at the Museum. Photo DOANE GREGORY  BLOOMBERG NEWS Night at the Museum Battle of the Smithsonian 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Teddy Roosevelt that wellspring of American folk wisdom is just about to define happiness at the start of Night at the Museum Battle of the Smithsonian when hes rudely interrupted by a text message. Bzzzt. Bzzzt. The recipient Larry Daley (Ben Stiller) the embattled guard from 2006s first Night at the Museum more recently the marketing genius behind the Glow-in-the-Dark Flashlight and other infomercial doodads. He and T.R. (Robin Williams) are yakking it up inside the Museum of Natural History enjoying the benefits of an ancient Egyptian tablet that brings to life fossils diorama miniatures and assorted garrulous statuary after sundown every day. But change is comin. Cowboys and Romans cavemen and Sacajawea are all boxed up and ready for mothballing in the Smithsonians Federal Archives. Larry bumming wants to keep them all in New York; rough-riding Roosevelt is more philosophical. ""The key to happiness true happiness"" he intones but before he can get past ""is"" Larrys cell phone vibrates. Then -- great timing -- daylight streams through the window effectively freezing the 26th president in mid-bromide. But theres sure to be another sunset in this sometimes inventive sometimes rote sequel which takes the same director (Shawn Levy) the same screenwriters (Robert Ben Garant and Thomas Lennon) and much of the same cast (Owen Wilson as Jed the micro-cowboy) then sets them loose in the nations attic with a whole new collection of artifacts. Some of the results are delightfully loopy. Some are cornball You can bet that Larry will define True Happiness on his own before the plot is over. The film offers enough ingenious touches and playful humor that the less-inspired elements hit with a screech -- the unmistakable sound of grinding screenplay mechanics. What works? Jonah Hill in a pocket-size role as an alarmed security guard. Amy Adams as a lovely plucky Amelia Earhart. Bill Hader as a blond Breck-girl General Custer. Best of all Hank Azaria as Kahmunrah a lisping Egyptian in a flattering tunic (""thith is not a dreth"") who wants the tablet for his own nefarious purposes (unlock the gate of the underworld and rouse a dead army the usual). Other nifty cameos include Napoleon (Alain Chabat apoplectic) Ivan the Terrible (Christopher Guest bearded) and a row of helpful Einstein bobbleheads at the Air amp; Space gift shop. Darth Vader and Oscar the Grouch come to life. So do a Degas dancer a Calder mobile a Pollock splatter a Koons balloon dog and the iconic V-E Day smooching-sailor photo into which Larry and Amelia escape for a brief whirl through a monochromatic Times Square. What doesnt work? The last reel and a half. The ceaseless cheek-slapping jokes even the ones with monkeys. The gaping plot holes I would really like to know how Jed manages to phone Larry from a storage container in the bowels of the Smithsonian. And unless I misconstrued the ending Im pretty sure it portends doom for anyone in the path of a large metal object likely to drop from the sky at sunrise.

Kate Taylor From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Thursday May 21 2009 1225PM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 319PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Night at the Museum Battle of the Smithsonian Directed by Shawn Levy Written by Robert Ben Garant and Thomas Lennon Starring Ben Stiller Amy Adams Robin Williams Hank Azaria and Owen Wilson Classification PG Night at the Museum Battle of the Smithsonian begins gorgeously with loving footage of the stuffed animals and wax-work figures that animated the original Ben Stiller comedy about a museum security guard who herded the exhibits that came mysteriously to life after hours. The camera lingers on their static faces and posed bodies as they are wheeled through the halls of New Yorks American Museum of Natural History and packed into shipping crates. A human hand sweeps a collection of miniature soldiers into a case of Styrofoam peanuts; a lid slams shut on the staring face of a mannequin. The dusty atmosphere is heavy with expectation. If only director Shawn Levy could maintain the magic throughout the inevitable sequel to the 2006 hit Night at the Museum . Unfortunately once these creatures do come to life for a second outing the promise soon evaporates and the clever comedy built largely on crisscrossing anachronisms and various sly cultural references is not enough to sustain a romp that is all rather predictable - despite the presence of an ancient Egyptian king a giant squid and Napoleon. This time around night security guard Larry Daley (Stiller) has left the museum to make millions peddling glow-in-the-dark flashlights but he happens to visit on the day his old friends are being shipped off to deep storage at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. It seems they are being replaced by new interactive displays. During their final night together the avuncular statue of Teddy Roosevelt (Robin Williams) reveals to Larry that this will be their last The Egyptian tablet that lets them come to life after dark is not going with them. Except that the sneaky capuchin monkey brings it along and pretty soon all the exhibits in the gigantic (but fictional) storage vault underneath Washingtons National Mall as well as every art work and display in all the Smithsonian museums have come to life. The cultural gags are great - a Jeff Koons balloon dog bounces around a gallery; mission control from the Air and Space Museum is getting ready to launch - but the plot is a thin one emanating from an Egyptian exhibit. A deeply resentful royal named Kahmunrah (an appropriately snotty Hank Azaria with a lisping English accent) wants to steal that magic tablet bring his warriors back from the afterlife and take over the world while Larry and his miniature pals the explorer Jedediah Smith (Owen Wilson) and the Roman general Octavius (Steve Coogan) have to stop him. The Egyptian enlists Napoleon Ivan the Terrible and Al Capone but rejects Oscar the Grouch as merely grumpy and Darth Vader as symbolically complicated the kind of references that will keep the accompanying grown-ups giggling. Similarly theres some quick humour in the notion that the notorious General Custer will take charge of the characters from New York but the joke about his vanity and stupidity has worn thin long before he has a crisis of confidence in the final battle scene. Believing in the emotional dilemma of a standing joke is impossible; similarly the attempt to provide a love interest for Larry in the form of a gung-ho Amelia Earhart (Amy Adams doing her best with a thin role) is just painful and the film grinds to a halt every time the audience is forced to suffer through their romantic moments. Stiller himself is a great straight man and excels here at offering deadpan responses to murderous Egyptians and rampaging wildlife but with such potentially powerful foils as Williamss Roosevelt and Ricky Gervais in the role of the New York museum director largely relegated to the background more prolonged comedy never takes hold. The effects from the gyrating squid to the bumptious dino are impressive of course with the exception of the techies attempts to animate marble. Both the trio of unfortunate putti who sing love songs for Larry and Amelia and a giant Abraham Lincoln who steps off his chair at the Lincoln Memorial to save the day look painfully fake. Yes with this sequel Levy has taken one giant leap from the contained halls of a single museum to the entire Smithsonian complex and the National Mall itself but in this case more art does not more movie make.

But here it is  and its better than predicted though hardly fault-free the Toy Story-esque plot could be written on the femur of dormouse and some scenes still lean towards inanity. But in the main this is a  funnier and more coherent slice of kids entertainment. The first instalment saw Ben Stillers museum nightwatchman grapple with an assemblage of natural history exhibits that mysteriously sprang to life. Despite his new career as a flash entrepreneur Larry (Stiller) has never forgotten his band of eclectic pals. So when he hears that New Yorks Museum of Natural History has shipped its dated exhibits to the Smithsonian Institutes underground storage facility he feels compelled to do something about it. He sneaks his way into the Institute and enlists Amy Adamss Amelia Earhart to help him hatch a rescue plan. But he hasnt figured on Hank Azarias lisping Pharaoh... Stiller is still vaguely likeable in the lead but the rest of the original cast (Robin Williams Owen Wilson Steve Coogan and Ricky Gervais) remain unconvincing. Thank heavens then for newcomers Adams Azaria and Bill Hader. Adams nails her period part with old-fashioned gusto and Hader is uproarious as a camp General Custer. But its Azarias immature Pharaoh who remains most memorable; his pantomime scenes are reminiscent of vintage Python.

"Night at the Museum Battle of the Smithsonian - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMOVIE REVIEW Night at the Museum Battle of the SmithsonianMay 22 2009|BETSY SHARKEY | FILM CRITIC Imagine history night at the Improv only with marble floors and no hecklers ""Hank youre a 3000-year-old Egyptian mummy named Kahmunrah its 2009 and you just woke up go . . . "" and you have ""Night at the Museum Battle of the Smithsonian."" Its not so much a movie as a series of running antiquity gags good for a comedy club not so much for the multiplex.Ben Stiller is back as Larry Daley though hes ditched the night guard gig at the Museum of Natural History in New York City despite the very cool gold tablet that hangs in the Egyptian room and actually brings everything to life at night. Now hes become an infomercial king with a fortune made hawking gadgets like glow-in-the-dark flashlights with his good pal George Foreman. Since nothing even remotely interesting or funny happens outside of the museum thankfully we dont stay there long.As director Shawn Levy pretty much worked through all of the Natural History Museums dioramas bony T. rexes stuffed mammoths and most of Teddy Roosevelts (Robin Williams) sage advice in the first film he has taken the show on the road. Besides museum traffic is down hologram-creating 3-D technology is taking over and so the gang is being packed up and shipped to the Smithsonian for storage which means that Owen Wilson Steve Coogan and most of the stars of the first film are back."");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""649"" height=""160""gt;Who can save the day? Why gosh I bet Larry Daley can. Actually its Amelia Earhart who does Amy Adams in excellent form as superwoman Earhart looking fabulous in jodhpurs and a cropped leather/shearling jacket. Theres a derring-do to her 30s patter laced with words like ""flyboy"" and ""skedaddle"" and a style that evokes Katharine Hepburn.Whether or not she wins Larrys heart who cares she had the rest of us at ""Hello.""Shes been brought to life for the night by the gold tablet which the Natural History guys sneaked into their packing crates. But theres a downside to that as history is filled with at least as many villains as heroes and this particular wing of the Smithsonian has more than its share.The main bad man is Kahmunrah a very funny Hank Azaria playing the fictional pharaoh very imperious and very fey. For Kahmunrah its a sibling rivalry issue; the gold tablet was at the NYC museum with his brother but it fits in one of the relics from Kahmunrahs tomb and besides mom meant him to have it. Now if he can just unlock its mystery hell be able to open a door to the past call up his evil legions and rule the world.As luck would have it some of the most notorious villains ever are housed under the same roof including Ivan the Terrible (Christopher Guest) Napoleon (Alain Chabat) and Al Capone (Jon Bernthal) and Kahmunrah recruits them all. Unfortunately they dont do all that much for him and they do even less for the movie.Though the context throughout the film is meant to be a clever take on what history teaches us as the story unfolds and the battles rage what we get instead is too much pointless slapstick epitomized when the capuchin monkey and Stiller face off slapping each other silly. Theres a new conceit thats been added with the pictures hanging in the galleries coming to life too. It works quite well when a classic photo provides a clever escape for Larry and Amelia who hide in the Times Square crowd on VJ Day while the soldier kisses the nurse and not as well when Amelia dances with the Degas ballerinas.In case you were expecting one there is no real moral to this story from screenwriters Robert Ben Garant and Thomas Lennon the team who also wrote the first film based on Milan Trencs childrens book of the same name. Still there is some fun to be had in watching big clumsy things run noisily through a museum.Maybe next time the gang could head to Punxsutawney Pa. You know little furry Phil Bill Murray ""Groundhog Day"" meets ""Night of the Living Dead."" In a museum.

(Gregory/AP) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday May 21 2009 1106 AM Title Night at the Museum Battle of the Smithsonian With its perfect premise and dream cast 2006s ""Night at the Museum"" should have been the ideal kid flick. But the filmmakers went the easy route offering up dumb jokes and a half-hearted storyline. Still with so many assets the flaws didnt matter audiences made it the second biggest movie of the year.With that kind of triumph you couldnt blame director Shawn Levy and his writers Robert Ben Garant and Thomas Lennon for staying lazy. To their credit however they took the criticisms to heart making this second adventure far more fun.Ben Stiller is back as Larry Daley though hes left his job as a night guard at the Museum of Natural History. When he returns for a visit hes stunned to find the old exhibits headed for the Smithsonian to make room for the charmless new displays cooked up by curator McPhee (Ricky Gervais).What Stiller knows of course is that the dioramas and statues are real and come to life each night. So when he gets a panicked call from cowboy Jedediah Smith (Owen Wilson) he immediately races down to D.C.What he finds is Egyptian pharaoh Kahmunrah (Hank Azaria) threatening the newcomers including Smiths friend Octavius (Steve Coogan). Soon a war is underway pitting General Custer (Bill Hader) Teddy Roosevelt (Robin Williams) and Amelia Earhart (Amy Adams) against foes like Ivan the Terrible (Christopher Guest) and Napoleon (Alain Chabat).Some of the actors have a better time than others with the amusingly campy Azaria taking the lead. Adams unfortunately fares the worst due to her overcooked 1920s dialogue and a complete lack of chemistry with Stiller.Levy is hardly going to threaten even the most underachieving history teacher given that he always favors the slapstick gag over the smart joke or observation.But he works hard to make the most of his setting flying around the Air and Space Museum sneaking inside iconic photographs and turning famous statues to life. Hes successful enough in fact that kids may well pass on their next chance to see a movie--just so they can visit a real museum instead.

By Ty Burr Globe Staff / May 22 2009 Email| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + People Mr. Daly want the next thing"" says a character to ex-museum guard Larry Daly (Ben Stiller) in ""Night at the Museum Battle of the Smithsonian"" and theres Hollywoods rationale for sequelitis in an over-budgeted computer-generated nutshell. The follow-up to the surprise 2006 hit movie reeks of No. 2 Its bigger noisier shinier and dumber and it has no earthly reason to exist. The kids will scarf it down like junk food and move on.Still lets savor the few pieces of wit that have made it through the sausage factory intact. First and foremost is Hank Azaria as Kahmunrah the villainous Egyptian pharaoh who rules over Washingtons Smithsonian Archives when night falls and the magic tablet of the first film animates the exhibits. The actor combines Boris Karloffs plummy diction from the original ""Mummy"" with a lisp worthy of Monty Pythons Michael Palin; you could close your eyes and have a ball just listening to him but then youd miss Azarias slyly hammy way with a tunic.Also inspired is the way the paintings sculptures and photographs in the complexs fine arts wing come alive from a pirouetting Degas ballerina to a bouncing Jeff Koons balloon dog. At one point the heroes take refuge in a blowup of Alfred Eisenstaedts famous snapshot of a sailor kissing a nurse in Times Square and for a head-spinning moment were in a black-and-white 40s movie complete with guys from Flatbush.The rest is inane overstuffed frenzy. The plot has the exhibits from New Yorks Museum of Natural History mothballed and shipped to gather dust in the Smithsonians warehouses; Larry journeys down to rescue his friends rediscover his calling in life (successful businessman bad; museum guard good) and woo the plucky Amelia Earhart (Amy Adams). Since shes slated to turn to wood at dawn theres not a lot of future in the relationship.Whats most galling about ""Battle of the Smithsonian"" is its waste of real talent. Robin Williamss Teddy Roosevelt is left behind in New York and the pairing of Owen Wilsons itty-bitty cowboy and Steve Coogans miniature Octavius is a bust this time. (Coogan looks actively depressed to be here.)Of the new characters Adamss Earhart is a flighty pill with no resemblance to the woman herself Alain Chabats Napoleon is the butt of wheezy short jokes and why cast Christopher Guest as Ivan the Terrible if youre going to smother him in fake whiskers and not let him do anything? Bill Haders General George Custer is typical of the movies approach Hire a ""funny"" actor roll the cameras and let him schpritz until he runs out of gas. Its a family film - who needs a script?Its possible that the people responsible for this movie - director Shawn Levy and writers Robert Ben Garant and Thomas Lennon - think theyre teaching kids about history. Well no theyre dumbing down history to the shopping-mall level of rapping cherubim a jive-talking Abe Lincoln and a crew of Albert Einstein bobbleheads singing ""Thats the Way I Like It."" ""Battle of the Smithsonian"" is to the first movie what a gift shop is to a museum a hallway full of overpriced bling you pass through on your way out the door.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Night at the Museum Battle of the Smithsonian Director Shawn Levy. Cast Ben Stiller Hank Azaria Amy Adams. Rating Rated PG for mild action and brief language. Great Good Fair Bad Bomb Related More monkey slaps more humiliation for Stiller Adams flies high in Museum Spotlight Ben Stiller Cliches will find plenty of company there. Its not a bad movie. Just an unnecessary one. Despite offering a few new characters the sequel to ""Night at the Museum"" does nothing the first film didnt do better with the exception of letting Hank Azaria go nuts with the role of Kahmunrah the evil older brother of Pharaoh Ahkmenrah from the original. Azaria cant be on-screen enough; unfortunately he cant be on-screen all the time because its not Kahmunrahs story. Instead it is once again the story of Larry Daley (Ben Stiller). Hes now an as-seen-on-TV gadget mogul (the glow-in-the-dark flashlight actually looks cool) having left his days as a night watchman at the Museum of Natural History behind. He still likes his friends there the displays that come to life but with thumbs permanently attached to his Blackberry its hard to find time for everything. Sounds like someone needs to evaluate what really makes him happy. Bad news Dr. McPhee (Ricky Gervais welcome in his return) informs Larry on a rare visit that the exhibits are being taken down replaced by high-tech displays. The originals will be shipped to the Smithsonian in Washington D.C. Larry wants the exhibits back of course but theres no big hurry. That is until tiny Jedediah Smith (Owen Wilson) calls in a panic. The tablet that brings the displays to life is at the Smithsonian too. Fine except they include Kahmunrah an angry man always passed over for his younger brother. Hes been stewing for 3000 years and sees this as his moment to take over the world. Hell need help of course help that arrives in the form of Ivan the Terrible (Christopher Guest criminally underused) Napoleon (Alain Chabat) and Al Capone (Jon Bernthal) and their assorted minions. Kahmunrah needs Larry to translate the tablet basically so that he can unleash undead warriors. Larrys not so hot on the idea understandably but events conspire to make him comply. He reluctantly enlists the aid of Amelia Earhart (Amy Adams) whose insistence on talking like a wise-cracking character out of a 30s screwball comedy is so annoying even Larry has to comment on it. Too bad because Adams can be delightful. And while she does muster up plenty of pluck everyone is overshadowed by Azaria whose Kahmunrah is one of those characters who has grand ambition - it doesnt get much grander than world domination - but cant quite figure out how to realize it. If his intelligence matched his ego maybe hed get somewhere but he wouldnt be nearly as funny. Old favorites like Octavius (Steve Coogan) are joined by such newcomers as Gen. George Custer (Bill Hader). The movie gets a lot of use out of such Smithsonian highlights as the Air and Space Museum; perhaps the coolest new gimmick is gallery artwork coming to life though the bit where Larry and Amelia jump into the famous photo of the sailor kissing the nurse at the end of World War II has something of a ""Last Action Hero"" feel to it. Then again the whole movie has the feel of something familiar - namely the original available for rental everywhere. Theres nothing wrong with ""Night at the Museum Battle of the Smithsonian"" exactly. Theres just nothing outside of Azarias hilarious turn that improves upon the original.

"movie review night at the museum battle of the smithsonian - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Entertainment Entertainment Movie review Night at the Museum Battle of the Smithsonian -- 3 out of 5 stars A scene from Night at the Museum Battle of the Smithsonian 20th Century Fox 20th Century Fox Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic The warm moments rise from the real history sampled in Night at the Museum Battle of the Smithsonian. The kid-friendly thrills come from the special effects -- the monsters mannequins artifacts and paintings that come to life in this sequel to Night at the Museum.But the laughs roll out of Ben Stillers verbal sparring with Amy Adams Jonah Hill Hank Azaria Bill Hader and Robin Williams. When this excessive and silly farce works -- roughly half the time -- its thanks to the comic dynamic created by funny folk who can go riff-to-riff with Stiller. When Jonah Hill (Superbad) as a Smithsonian security guard gets after Larry (Stiller) the former security guard of New Yorks Museum of Natural History its a throw-down.""Youre moving with some I.T.T. bro"" ""I.T.T.?""""Thats intent-to-touch homie.""When Hank Azaria affects an English-accented lisp as a pharaoh bent on world conquest Stiller stifles a laugh.On the other hand the sometimes hilarious Christopher Guest is given nothing funny to play as Ivan the Terrible and thats what he plays -- nothing. Larry has left his museum gig and gone into infomercials. But he still checks in on his friends (Robin Williams as Teddy Roosevelt Owen Wilson as a cowboy miniature). Thats when he learns theyre going into storage replaced by cool interactive holograms. The ""friends"" brought to life by a pharaohs magical tablet are to be stored in the vast Smithsonian archives where another pharaoh is revived and hopes to use that tablet ""to summon my army of the dead."" He enlists Napoleon Al Capone and Ivan the you-know-what.Larry must bust into the Smithsonian and save the world because tonight history really does ""come alive"" in the largest museum in the world.Amy Adams plays a plucky and adorably sexy Amelia Earhart who resolves to help Larry on his quest. Everything from Rodins The Thinker to The Lincoln Memorial plays a role. All heck breaks out in the Air and Space Museum home of the Wright Brothers and the Tuskegee Airmen (Craig Robinson given nothing funny to do).These are kids movies with the odd moment of History with a capital H. General Custer (Bill Hader of Saturday Night Live amusing) has his moment of doubt Lincoln and Roosevelt toss a few of their immortal words our way and Amelia Earhart keeps getting lost. Adams is the heart of the movie. That Amelia had moxie.Its a clunky stumbling film. But its funny to see Hill Hader Azaria and Adams push Stiller toward something like his old A-game. Managing that in a movie likely to lure children into museums makes this Battle if not an outright win at least a draw.

Custer (Bill Hader) in Battle of the Smithsonian. WATCH THE TRAILER By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Night at the Museum Battle of the Smithsonian (  out of four) resembles an enthusiastic but undisciplined child running amok through an exhibit. The exuberance might be admirable but the headlong dashing and lurching around are major distractions. This sequel to the hit Night at the Museum is set at the Smithsonian and in its (invented) subterra archive. The original set in New Yorks Museum of Natural History and directed by Shawn Levy focused on animal and historical figures coming to life after hours but the follow-up is more ambitious. Levy brings back favorites from the first movie and introduces legions of new characters from Pharaoh Kahmunrah (Hank Azaria) to Gen. George Armstrong Custer (Bill Hader) Ivan the Terrible (Christopher Guest) and Einstein bobble-heads (Eugene Levy). Ben Stillers Larry Daley who has gone from night guard to corporate honcho is called on to rescue his exhibit friends being put in storage at the Smithsonian. He joins forces with spunky Amelia Earhart (an engaging Amy Adams) and fends off the intrusions of a Smithsonian guard (Jonah Hill) and various other museum threats. The plot feels cobbled together and the writing slapdash however and many of the jokes fall into broad slapstick of the lowest-common-denominator variety. Stillers character in the first film was outwitted and slapped around by a Capuchin monkey. This time hes slapped around by two monkeys. The more-is-better philosophy dominates obscuring some of the subtler comic historic allusions. And in most cases the talents of the cast a whos who of comic actors are underused. Yet there are inspired segments including fantasy scenarios in which famous paintings and sculptures come to dazzling life. Stiller fighting a horde of ancient warriors borrows the pitchfork from the elderly farmer in Grant Woods American Gothic.Rodins The Thinker turns out to be a muscleman dolt and Degas Little Dancer sculpture provides a brief respite from all the peril with enchanting ballet steps. But those spritely scenarios are drowned out by the manic mayhem. (Rated PG for mild action and brief language. Running time 1 hour 44 minutes. Opens tonight in some theaters and nationwide Friday.)

Bigger and even more chaotically crowded (more stars more f/x) than its predecessor ""Night at the Museum Battle of the Smithsonian"" proves that adding another ring doesnt make for a better circus. Swapping Gothams Natural History Museum for D.C.s Smithsonian this ""Night at the Museum"" sequel reunites Ben Stillers ex-security guard with former cast members and adds dozens more. But where the original had a vaguely tenable narrative hook (deadbeat dad finds redemption through nocturnal heroics) the new pic seems purely a vehicle for lavish visuals and cheap gags. Still the 2006 comedy-adventure soared past tepid reviews to a 574 million global B.O.; chances are this ""Night"" also will be a mammoth success. The woolly mammoth that stomped through the original is back albeit briefly as now-successful inventor/entrepreneur Larry Daley (Stiller) revisits his old digs the Museum of Natural History and were briefly reminded of the ancient curse that caused the museum denizens to spring to life. Still there the miniature figurines Octavius (Steve Coogan) and Jedediah (Owen Wilson); a playful dinosaur fossil and mischievous monkey; and a waxworks Teddy Roosevelt (Robin Williams). But when museum director Dr. McPhee (Ricky Gervais) explains that the longtime exhibits are about to be shipped to D.C.s Federal Archives discarded in favor of high-tech holographic displays Larry realizes he may never see the gang again. That doesnt seem to bother him too much until he receives a distress call from Jed telling him the grumpy Egyptian ruler Kahmunrah (Hank Azaria sounding like a cross between Daffy Duck and Jeremy Irons) has awakened from a 3000-year rest only to set his sights on global domination. Urged by his son (Jake Cherry) Larry speeds to the Smithsonian steals a badge from an easily impressed junior guard (Jonah Hill) and breaks into the archives. Amid a virtual sea of storage crates -- theres even a leviathan squid -- Larry finds the gang and tries to engineer an escape. Plucky Amelia Earhart (Amy Adams trying a bit too hard) joins him only to be matched by a trio of historys worst villains Ivan the Terrible (Christopher Guest) Napoleon (French comic Alain Chabat) and Al Capone (Jon Bernthal) whove united with Kahmunrah to create the ultimate axis of evil. But wait theres more Abe Lincoln (also voiced by Azaria) steps out of his chair at the Lincoln Memorial to pitch in Albert Einstein (voiced by Eugene Levy) helps solve a mathematical riddle and Gen. George Custer (Bill Hader) stands around trying to decide what to do. If theres no kitchen sink in here its probably because the filmmakers (returning helmer Shawn Levy and scribes Robert Ben Garant and Thomas Lennon) couldnt devise a way to work one in. Instead of adding a plethora of new distractions perhaps they should have focused on Larrys motivation. He seems to have very little at stake in this battle and its tough to know why were supposed to root for him. One clever new element involves the animating of classic artworks (among them Degas ""Little Dancer""; Woods ""American Gothic"" Hoppers ""Nighthawks""). The gimmick works to varying effect -- sometimes brilliantly (the sight of Jeff Koons ""Balloon Dog Red"" hopping about is priceless); sometimes offensively (did Rodins ""Thinker"" really need a Bronx accent?). One all-too-brief sequence even has Larry and Amelia jumping into the celebrated Alfred Eisenstaedt Times Square photo ""The Kiss"" surrounded by WWII veterans against a black-and-white cityscape. (It also sets up a joke that will pay off later; watch for Jay Baruchel in a quickie cameo.) The chaos escalates into a whiz-bang collision of f/x involving the Octopus the Wright Brothers the Tuskegee airmen and too much of everything but what made Larry likable in the first film. Production design and lensing and general tech credits are top notch even if Alan Silvestris score is overblown. There is however one very positive consequence of the original film worth noting In the wake of ""Night at the Museum"" the Museum of Natural History reported attendance was up 20% particularly among kids whose interest was sparked by the film. The museum even began hosting Night at the Museum Sleepovers that still continue. If the Smithsonian sees a similar attendance surge and an increased interest in art and history thanks to this movie then this ""Night at the Museum"" may be worth the trouble.

But in Night at the Museum Battle of the Smithsonian the waxworks figures who come to life after sundown arent crassly sketchy or dramatically lacking. Theyre one-dimensional all right but knowingly delightfully so. Even at their most pop-up brash theyre true to the way that kids see history. Theyre like characters out of a cool yet innocent mischief-at-midnight childrens book -- a Where the Wild Things Are of global story-time kitsch. And they give you a lift. The movie make no mistake is clownishly silly a lark as light as balsa wood. If anything though its a faster wittier spin on the formula of its predecessor. Released in 2006 Night at the Museum was a family popcorn extravaganza that touched a chord even its producers may not have anticipated. In the sequel Ben Stiller as the former night guard Larry Daley (hes now a successful entrepreneur...of flashlights) spends one long night infiltrating the galleries of the Smithsonian Institution where he ? attempts to rescue the exhibits he first got to know at the American Museum of Natural History. (Hes trying to get his hands on the magical Egyptian tablet that brings them to life.) The T.rex the capuchin monkeys Attila the Hun -- all have been shipped to the archives of the Smithsonian. And all are as feisty as ever. But Battle of the Smithsonian tilts away from the zoological. The film is a history-of-the-world burlesque in which such drolly self-centered icons as General Custer (Bill Hader) Ivan the Terrible (Christopher Guest) and Kahmunrah (Hank Azaria) -- a made-up pharoah who lisps with the enthusiasm of Boris Karloff on his own reality show -- collide happily with ?a living army of Albert Einstein bobblehead dolls plus stone-carved angels who sing ""More Than a Woman"" and The Thinker come to life as a Brooklyn deadbeat. This is what you call a wholesome kiddie movie on drugs. It all works because Stiller with his eager-to-please anxiety and his incredulous double takes is the perfect addled straight man for a hellzapoppin history show. And it works because Amy Adams as Amelia Earhart has the breathless daffy-sexy vivacity of a 30s screwball heroine her eyes lit with fire her delivery as sharp as cut glass as she rat-a-tats out lines like ""You havent been able to take your cheaters off my chassis since we met"" Battle of the Smithsonian has plenty of life. But its Adams who gives it zing.

Director Shawn Levy and star Ben Stiller return (as do Robin Williams Steve Coogan and Owen Wilson--alongside newbies Bill Hader Jonah Hill Christopher Guest and Jay Baruchel) for this bank-breaking sequel to the 2006 original in which a directionless single dad takes a job as the night guard at New Yorks Museum of Natural History then takes on its various exhibits when an ancient Egyptian tablet brings them to life. Smithsonian begins with those same exhibits being shipped off to the Washington D.C. museum of the same name Larry Daley (Stiller) having abandoned them for fortune as a small-time inventor. When the tablet winds up in D.C. it animates the entire museums collection including a rogue posse led by a lisping Egyptian pharaoh (Hank Azaria) and a gratingly plucky Amelia Earhart (Amy Adams). Though its a little slow to start and some of the humor clunks the film features a wholesome charm some truly dazzling effects (the Lincoln Memorial alone is worth it) and enough mild parent-nip in-jokes to keep all but the stone-hearted happy.
