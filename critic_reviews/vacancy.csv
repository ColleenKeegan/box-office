And...? With a set-up that familiar a half-decent twists clearly required so as the couple kick back hubby finds a seemingly discarded videotape which reveals that the very room in which theyre staying has been used by the proprietor to shoot snuff movies with understandably unwilling previous guests. Clearly theyre next in line unless they can outwit their tormentors.Sadly thats just about the point where the picture runs out of juice degenerating into a mechanical exercise in shunting the characters around from set-piece to set-piece yet with only two potential victims with which to toy the story options prove predictably limited. Creepy motel manager Frank Whaleys the pick of a relatively able cast and Hungarian director Nimrod Antal (who made the stylish Kontroll in Budapest) throws the camera around with abandon but all concerned are on a hiding to nothing since the materials so flimsy and underdeveloped. Its not pretty but its certainly vacant.

At first glance they appear to be nasty slasher films. At second glance they appear to be nasty slasher films taking place in the very same room where Amy and David are staying.If theres any doubt about whats happening check out Vacancys cast credits. Nine of the 16 roles in this slick sick-o exercise share the same description snuff victim.Antal film-schooled in Hungary lets the tension between Amy and David and Amy David and a mousy desk clerk (Frank Whaley) build slowly. But once the Foxes are tucked behind door No. 4 the brain-rattling phone calls (no ones on the other end) and mysterious thumping begins. Its not long before the stalkers/killers/cinema-vA(c)ritA(c) artistes are trying to break in and Amy and David are desperately trying to break out.Mark L. Smiths screenplay merrily deploys the usual scare-fare requirements a suspiciously friendly stranger the absence of cell-phone signals a cop who fails to call for back-up.Beckinsale and Wilson playing a husband and wife whose marriage has fallen apart in the wake of their young sons death are convincingly hostile to one another when theyre still safely in their car.But once theyre holed up in old Pinewood they have to put aside the blame and doubt pool their resources and their resolve or die. Vacancy in the end simply offers a particularly aggressive brand of couples counseling.Vacancy  (out of four stars) Written by Mark L. Smith directed by Nimrod Antal.

"Vacancy Lean thriller | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesVacancy Lean thrillerFrom its Hitchcock beat to its wrong-turn plot Vacancy is empty of novelty - and thats a very good thing for once. Kate Beckinsale and Luke Wilson realize that they may be checking out early at the horror hotel in Vacancy.  (SCREEN GEMS)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. April 20 2007 (out of 4)Starring Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale. Directed by Nimrod Antal. 85 minutes. At major theatres. 14A From its Hitchcock beat to its wrong-turn plot Vacancy is empty of novelty.And thats a very good thing for once. Because in seeking to simply goose our pulse rate rather than provoke our gag reflex director Nimrod Antal helps revive the art of old-school shocks. Article Continued BelowWorking a lean script by Mark L. Smith that clocks in well under 90 minutes Antal (Kontroll) makes only a few promises and delivers on all of them.Estranged couple David (Luke Wilson) and Amy Fox (Kate Beckinsale) are driving a dark and lonely road back to their fractured marital home after an unhappy final visit to Amys family.They will be soon be signing papers for the divorce brought on by the death of their young son a tragedy with collateral damage. All that remains between David and Amy are unhappy memories bitter exchanges and miles of darkness.While Amy slumbers in the passenger seat knocked out by prescription drugs David makes the classic mistake he leaves the interstate for a secondary road he wrongly assumes will be a short cut.Before you can yell ""turn back"" David and Amy find themselves with car trouble at a latter-day Bates Motel replete with Psycho bird imagery. But theres a nice Mel Brooks touch too - screams emanating from the office turn out to be from the soundtrack of the horror film watched by nerdy night manager Mason (Frank Whaley).""Gets a little boring around here late nights"" Mason explains squinting through his oversized specs at David and Amy his only guests.He offers them the ""honeymoon suite"" for a extra five bucks because it comes with ""a few extra perks."" Thats not what most people would call cockroaches brown tap water dusty furniture and soiled bed linen which David and Amy discover when they turn the key. They resign themselves to staying up all night waiting for the mechanic promised for the morning. To while away the hours David starts looking at the untitled videos he finds in the room. To his surprise they are snuff movies of people attempting to ward off masked attackers. To David and Amys slow-dawning horror hidden cameras in the very same honeymoon suite filmed the videos - and now someone is pounding at the door.If this were a film by most of the current breed of horror/thriller merchants the couple and the audience would be in for carnage most visceral. But Vacancy is mainly grindhouse without the gristle and all the more effective for it.The point of Vacancy is the terror not the torture - unlike the dead-end destinations of Saw Hostel and their ilk. Horror is vastly more effective when left to the minds eye and it is what we cant see in Vacancy that truly frightens.Antal borrows mightily from Hitchcock and that includes the animated titles and frenetic soundtrack. But he also learns from the master taking time to establish the back story of David and Amy so that we understand their unhappiness and care about the outcome of their desperate quest for survival.The use of shallow depth of field establishes a mood of claustrophobia and dread early on even before we have reason to fear.Wilson and Beckinsale are utterly believable as a couple on the verge of splitting who must work together again to remain alive.Vacancy is all about a wrong turn but its a trip worth taking nonetheless.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Its not as gleefully sadistic as say ""Hostel"" but it will give you one very rough nights sleep. Naturally I mean that as a compliment. Packing all the action into an effective 80 minutes director Nimrod Antal introduces our intended victims when theyre already on the long dark road to misery. In this case that road is somewhere in California where perpetually bickering couple David and Amy Fox (Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale) are lost. Making matters worse their car has broken down. They have no idea where they are its the middle of the night and their cell phones dont work but at least theres a motel right up the street with plenty of spare rooms. Even better the manager (an absurdly hammy Frank Whaley) insists on putting them in the honeymoon suite free of charge. What a break. Amy just wants to go to bed but David needs to unwind so he chooses one of the unmarked movies stacked next to the rooms VCR. At first hes disappointed that its horror instead of porn. But when he looks more closely he notices something odd The graphic murders on the tapes seem to have taken place in their room. Before he has quite figured out whats going on masked faces peer into the window doorknobs start rattling and the walls begin to shake. And David realizes that he and his wife can either fight flee or wind up starring in their very own snuff film. Although Antal knows how to create an atmosphere that will make his audience squirm he has very little patience for extras like say character development or plotting. Although Wilson is a likable hero Beckinsale makes her character so intensely irritating were barely rooting for her survival. But Antal sees ""Vacancy"" the way a tired trucker might eye a roadside motel Itll get the job done.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Theres no need for Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez to ""revive"" cheap exploitation films with their epic ""Grindhouse."" Those kinds of ultra-violent schlock movies begging teenagers and young men to play Russian roulette with their psyches never left us. Witness ""Vacancy"" a snuff film disguising itself ironically as a horror film one step removed from a snuff film. ""Vacancy"" is a quick and dirty job a mean little movie ripping off the atmosphere and decorations of ""Psycho"" and a half-dozen other horror-thriller classics. These filmmakers may believe they have smartened up a genre recently polluted by ""Saw III"" and ""Hostel"" but brutal is as brutal does. You can put lipstick on a pig but youll still wind up eating ham. Or in this case offal. Director Nimrod Antal and writer Mark Smith try to dress up the nasty proceedings with the kindly bland face of Luke Wilson and former ""Underworld"" hottie Kate Beckinsale. They are an unhappy couple driving home cross-country and he informs his peeved wife that he left the interstate for a shortcut in order to avoid a traffic tie-up. They end up at Motel Hell plenty of rooms available just leave a deposit and an address where we can forward your vital organs. Its a wonder anyone in America leaves the interstate at all anymore seeing as how this genre is crammed full of unfortunate detours; the exits always seem to lead to Stepford instead of Mayberry. More advice for travelers If the clerk behind the counter has a recurring twitch and watches slasher films in the back room leave immediately and look for something sanctioned by Best Western. Frank Whaley plays the unhelpful desk man; hes seen ""Deliverance"" it appears and he knows city folk are dumb as a post and timid as skinned rabbits. The Bickersons check into their room with interior decorating courtesy the Norman Bates collection. Cockroaches are thrown in gratis. Bored before bedtime Wilson pops in the videotapes sitting atop the television and its a fright fest of screaming women and amateurish murder shots. He looks a bit closer terrified The room decorations on the tapes match their own room. And he discovers cameras in every air vent. Looks like he and wifey are the involuntary cast for the next snuff film. You could be mad at me for giving away the central premise except Ive only gone half as far as the trailers go. Thats the other main problem with ""Vacancy"" besides all the sadistic delight taken in shots of pleading women. Once you get the new twist on voyeurism the rest is just an hour of pursuit. Will one or both of them make it out alive? Will the responding sheriff pay dearly for his curiousity? Will we stay at a bed and breakfast next time? Duh Yes to all three. At least theres honesty in advertising with a movie title like ""Vacancy."" It will certainly make you feel empty inside. Or slightly nauseous. Probably both.

"Vacancy leaves room for terror - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Events    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Vacancy leaves room for terror Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale play a bickering married couple who make a horrific discovery at a rural motel. (Suzanne Tenner) By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  April 20 2007 The ads are making ""Vacancy "" look like the latest meat-grinding horror special to come down the chute in the wake of ""Saw "" and ""The Hills Have Eyes ."" Its not. Its an entrance exam. And a pretty good one at that.Director Nimrod Antal made a stylish Hungarian film in 2003 called ""Kontroll "" about brutal power games among the ganglike employees of the Budapest subway system. Riding on that festival hit the L A -raised director has returned home to see what Hollywood might offer and come up with a stripped-down suspense drama that at its best begs comparisons to Steven Spielbergs breakthrough TV movie ""Duel ."" At its worst ""Vacancy"" is merely the kind of taut B-chiller they dont make any more other than to riff on them in ""Grindhouse. ""The set-up is as simple and stark as an urban legend. A bickering married couple David (Luke Wilson ) and Amy (Kate Beckinsale ) have car trouble on a country highway miles from the interstate. They hike back to a motel run by a weird little night manager (Frank Whaley ) and take the honeymoon suite. They put on a videotape which shows a horrific scene of murder so realistic it could be a snuff film.In fact it is a snuff film. And it was filmed in the room theyre standing in.The rest is pure cat-and-mouse but as scripted by Mark L. Smith and directed without an ounce of fat by Antal its nastily intelligent cat-and-mouse that rarely cheats the audience. ""Vacancy"" squeezes the maximum in suspense out of the minimum in location (with a relative minimum of gore; hows that for a trick?). It runs through every permutation of the motel-hell concept and when its done it stops. Really It just stops. I dont know when Ive seen a thriller this unpretentiously well-crafted sputter to so inconsequential an end.Still the filmmakers sketch in enough of David and Amys backstory for us to want them to survive. (Again such novelty.) The two have a dead child that has driven them to the brink of divorce; according to this movie nothing says ""couples therapy"" like a backwoods maniac coming at you with a digital camera and a butcher knife.Wilson and Beckinsale arent given much time to indulge in acting thankfully so their performances are harried and real. Whaley creates a memorable cracker-barrel lunatic behind those oversize aviators; Id swear he was modeling his role on Dennis Weavers jittery night clerk in the Orson Welles classic ""Touch of Evil .""Maybe thats not a coincidence. Unlike the new wave of torture porn ""Vacancy"" feels like it was made by people who love movies and perhaps have seen a lot of them. Those snuff flicks on the motel TV offer an implicit critique too What kind of person gets off on that? Someone for whom ""Saw III"" just isnt enough? The movie unnervingly hints theres a vast audience out there and one thats willing to pay retail.I dont want to oversell the thing. Theres no agenda in ""Vacancy"" other than to keep you in a state of nervous collapse for 85 minutes but Antal fulfills it honorably for the most part (that ending truly is a disappointment) and in so doing raises the stakes for his own future. Now lets see what he can really do.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. For more on movies go to boston.com/ae/movies/blog. (c) Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company.

By Peter Rainer Film critic April 20 2007 Save for later Saved New in theaters In the Land of Women (PG-13) Director Jon Kasdan. With Adam Brody Meg Ryan Kristen Stewart. (100 min.)Carter Webb (Adam Brody) has recently been dumped by his fashion-model girlfriend and flees Los Angeles for suburban Michigan to care for his ailing grandmother (Olympia Dukakis). He wants to get away from it all but living across the street is needy seductive Sarah (Meg Ryan) who has a serious illness a bad marriage and two daughters. The eldest (Kristen Stewart) like mom is attracted by Carters boyish insouciance. His ostensible profession is writing soft-core porn but he really wants to be a serious novelist. If so the life experiences he gains in this soppy schematic weepie wont help much. Written and directed by Jonathan Kasdan. Grade C-Sex/Nudity 4 scenes of innuendo. Violence 2 scenes including a fist fight. Profanity 25 expressions mostly strong. Drugs/Alcohol/Tobacco 5 scenes with alcohol; 1 with tobacco. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Vacancy (R) Director Nimrod Antal. With Luke Wilson Kate Beckinsale. (80 min.) Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Writer Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale play a divorcing couple who take a late-night detour on a country road get lost and end up staying at a lonely motel. It soon becomes clear that they are the only guests. The videos in their room turn out to be snuff movies - filmed in their very own room. How will they escape alive? This ghastly swatch of pulp horror is compelling at the most basic level but so little is going on in it that you might as well be watching a sadistic lab experiment performed on mice. The director Nimrod Antal an Angeleno who moved to Hungary when he was a teenager follows up his promising first feature ""Kontrol"" by going Hollywood in a depressingly big way. Grade C Still in theatersDisturbia (PG-13)Director D.J. Caruso. With Shia LaBeouf David Morse Carrie-Ann Moss. (104 min.)It was only a question of time before Hollywood came up with the idea of doing Hitchcocks ""Rear Window"" for the YouTube generation. Kale (Shia LaBeouf) is a gangly obstreperous teenager who is sentenced to house arrest for three months. He begins spying on his neighbors including Mr. Turner (David Morse) who keeps to himself and who Kale begins to suspect is a serial killer. With help from Ashley a teen beauty who has recently moved next door and from Kales best friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) he becomes a first-class amateur sleuth. ""Disturbia"" is a better-than-average teen pic crossed with a clunkier-than-average thriller. Grade B Sex/Nudity 11 scenes including voyeurism and innuendo. Violence 16 scenes often gruesome. Profanity 26 expressions mostly strong. Drugs/Alcohol/Tobacco 2 scenes with drinking. Next up Fury is a solid World War II movie throwback Shia Labeouf drops out of Broadway play. Why?

"Vacancy Dont Book It washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Vacancy Dont Book It Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints Friday April 20 2007 ""Vacancy"" is another motel-hell horror flick in which an unfortunate attractive couple (in this case Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale) discover that ""room service"" isnt about clean towels champagne and oysters so much as getting stabbed and videotaped for snuff films. Oops did we give things away? Hardly given the incessant previews -- all but revealing the entire plot -- that have preceded this Nimrod Antal movie. Whos Nimrod Antal youre wondering? Hes the director of the cultishly cool 2003 film ""Kontroll"" a Hungarian-made action movie about a team of athletic and gung-ho ticket inspectors in the Budapest underground. Which is to say that Antals slickly edited fast-moving style is the best thing about this otherwise-cliched movie in which David (Wilson) and Amy Fox (Beckinsale) take the wrong turn off the interstate suffer an auto breakdown and find themselves in a dilapidated motel filled with surveillance cameras and surrounded by psychotics in scary masks who apparently do this slaughter for a living. (They must be doing lousy business judging by how few folks pass by -- we see them sell one dusty box of videotapes to a truck driver.) For horror fans who appreciate a bit of craft with their second-rate experiences -- Paul Haslingers fear-mongering score is terrific for what its worth -- this might merit a future late-night rental. -- Desson Thomson Vacancy R 80 minutes Contains brutal violence and terror brief nudity and profanity.

"Vacancy | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; vacancy ) Vacancy (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli Vacancy is a nicely compact tense thriller that loses a little of its punch as a result of a rushed generic ending. For the most part the English-language debut of Nimrod Atal (Kontroll) offers a strong sense of atmosphere and escalating suspense. Its more interested in generating dread than offering cheap ""boo"" moments and/or splattering the screen with gore. There is a sense that the final scenes may have undergone some meddling although its unclear at what stage of the filmmaking process this may have occurred. Whatever the case the climax isnt up to the same level as much of what preceded it. In his novel Mexico Set Len Deighton writes the following ""If you see anything in the road drive over it. Too many people get killeda|swerving to avoid eyes they see shining in the headlights."" Thats advice David Fox (Luke Wilson) has never heard. While on a road trip with his soon-to-be-ex-wife Amy (Kate Beckinsale) David tries to avoid a raccoon in the road and ends up damaging his car. After the vehicle conks out the quarrelsome couple must hike more than a mile to arrive at a lonely roadside motel that would make the Bates establishment seem welcoming. The attendant (Frank Whaley) is creepy but meeting him is only the start of a very bad night. The TV in their room cant get an over-the-air signal but there are some video tapes. Instead of providing David with his hoped-for porn they show home-made snuff films. With a start David recognizes that they were made in the room he and Amy are in. Thats when the banging on the walls begins and the frightening guys in masks show up outside. Vacancy takes its time setting things up allowing us to get to know David and Amy. These two are relatively normal people not the dumb idiots that often populate this kind of movie. When the movie opens their marriage is pretty much over but theres nothing like a near-death experience to bring two people closer. There is no guarantee that either of them will survive to see the end credits. One of the strengths of Vacancy is that Atal never tips his hand. Until the final 15 minutes the film is not predictable and theres a sense that the protagonists may not make it out in one piece if they make it out at all. The movie plays on common human fears loud noises in the night a ringing phone with no one at the other end claustrophobia rats and roaches and a sense of profound isolation. Atal allows his cinematographer the veteran Andrzej Sekula (Pulp Fiction) to deepen the sense of impending doom. Every shot is carefully composed to enhance the suspense. There are some masterful moments perhaps none more ominous than those in which David and Amy are harassed by banging on the doors and walls. The viewer can almost taste the terror. Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale handle their ""everyperson"" roles effectively. I have never been a fan of Wilson in serious roles but his handling of David works. Beckinsale initially gives us a standoffish bitchy Amy but the character grows less abrasive as we work out her backstory and see her interact with her husband. Frank Whaleys motel manager is about as creepy as movie characters get - a kind of cross between Crispin Glover and Steve Buscemi. From the beginning theres no mystery that this guy is up to no good. If he was behind the desk of a place where I was considering renting a room Id start hitchhiking. At only about 80 minutes Vacancy is lean and mean. The film doesnt threaten to overstay its welcome and the quickness with which things are concluded doesnt allow the slightly sour aftertaste to linger. For the most part this movie hits the right notes and gives its audience a dose of white-knuckle tension. Vacancy offers energy and atmosphere and it may result in departing multiplex patrons paying careful attention to Deightons advice as they make a nighttime drive home.

In Hot Fuzz the Shaun of the Dead guys blow up a quaint English town. Plus Hopkins vs. Gosling. _ By David Edelstein ShareThis (Photo Courtesy of Rogue Pictures) In Shaun of the Dead (2004) Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg fused middle-class English suburban angst and zombie carnage. Some critics dubbed it a spoof of living-dead movies a scandalous misreading. Wright and Pegg were aiming higher using the living dead to spoof the English capacity for blotting out the bleeding obvious. I especially relished the heros meek dotty mother (Penelope Wilton) who neglects to tell her son about her bite from a highly contagious ghoul until shes about to transform into a ferocious zombie cannibal I didnt want to be a bother. Now Wright and Pegg have collaborated on Hot Fuzz in which a quaint olde English hamlet (clucking flower-shop lady hearty vicar etc.) becomes the setting for a splattery over-the-top Jerry Bruckheimerstyle buddy action picture. The hero Nicholas Angel (Pegg) is a humorless law-and-order cop whos bounced out of London for making too many arrests. Although theres little to do in wee Sandford (a finalist for the title of Englands most picturesque village) Angel begins to get a creepy Wicker Man vibe. When the doddering old police chief (Jim Broadbent) shrugs off a series of beheadings squashings and impalings (Accidents) the cop decides to take the law into his own hands. Its lucky the fat drunken constable (Nick Frost Peggs Shaun of the Dead sidekick) has a handy DVD of Bad Boys II to demonstrate how these things should be done. The English have a wellspring of comedy that will never be exhausted the combination of bestial urges and excellent manners. Tweedy pensioners suddenly wield massive artilleryand as in Shaun the mayhem is shockingly graphic which helps to keep the slapstick from getting too comfy. The climax lampoons the work of overfunded action auteurs while still delivering the goods. Stir this with your pinkie motherf---er Hot Fuzz is fun and its nice to see all the English character actors who arent busy in Harry Potter films but it lacks its predecessors freshness. Small-town English Fascism has been spoofed at least as far back as The Avengers and the heros odyssey doesnt have that archetypal Joseph Campbell kick. The ramshackle Shaun of the Dead was held together by more than just gags. It was at heart the story of a child-man who gets the courage to grow upto take responsibility for his life commit to a woman and make peace with his mother. That he could do this and still get to blow off the top of her head with a shotgunthats the magic of movies. Speaking of bestial urges and good manners Anthony Hopkins is back with his saturnine Hannibal Lecter shtick (this time he has a brogue) in the pretty-good courtroom nail-biter Fracture. He plays Ted Crawford an aeronautics magnate with a genius for constructing Rube Goldberg machinesa gift that comes in handy when he contrives to shoot his philandering wife (Embeth Davidtz) confess to the crime yet be virtually impossible to convict. How he loves taunting the sleazy hotshot young prosecutor Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling) whos about to leave for a lucrative job defending corporate cheatsbut who cant quite nail this last case down. This is one of those conversion melodramas in which the hero cant win until he discovers the true meaning of Christmas. Scene-by-scene beat-by-beat there isnt a single original note. What makes Fracture hum is the way Hopkins bares his teeth twitches his nostrils and trains his shiny pinprick Lecter eyes on his co-star. What can Gosling do against this shameless scene-stealer? He can get all Edward Norton Methodybut we know from Red Dragon that that wont work. He can go the other way chew a little scenery himself meet ham with hambut no one wins an overacting contest against Anthony Hopkins. Ah but Gosling is a smart guy with a marvelous sense of proportion. He knows that Crawford is supposed to walk all over the arrogant charmer Willy so he sits back and lets the scenes be stolento the point where we go Wake up you dick Go get him It helps of course that we cant take our eyes off Gosling even when he appears to be doing little. I like Hopkins but Ive seen all his tricks. Whats up Goslings sleeve? If Psycho and Peeping Tom are the seminal killer-as-voyeur movies Vacancy is the nasty little runt offspring with no other purpose in life but to gnaw on you. This it does uncommonly well. Youll be thrilled to know that todays Norman Bates isnt just a solitary freak. He has cameras everywhere accomplices and happy consumers for his snuff films. Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale play a couple on the verge of divorcing who end up in a seedy motel run by folksy-twitchy Frank Whaleyand let me tell you if your marriage is in trouble skip the therapist and find a psycho. Nothing brings people together faster. The Hungarian director Nimrod Antal made a dazzlingly unpleasant subway thriller called Kontroll and hes a master of destabilizing perspectives and jack-in-the-box scares that actually scare you. Alas thats what horror is about these days building the better audience trap. Next Oh Diane Hot Fuzz Directed by Edgar Wright. Rogue Pictures. R. Fracture Directed by Gregory Hoblit. New Line Cinema.

Theres no better form of marriage therapy -- according to the torture-chic horror romp ""Vacancy"" -- than being stuck in a fleabag motel and threatened by psychotic killers. Better yet make that mask-wearing sadists who not only want to terrify abuse and kill you but also sell videos of your painful demise. Whether a movie about snuff films is morally superior to a snuff film is a question for debate but ""Vacancy"" should have no trouble making B.O. hay in a marketplace hungry for the next big outrage. Dubious ethical aspects aside Nimrod Antal proves himself an able director who has made a highly cinematic movie. Shooter Andrzej Sekulas compositionsare startling for a film of this ilk the pace is appropriately brisk and everything clicks at least visually. Antal may rely on closeups -- and extreme closeups -- more than anyone since Carl Dreyer but what he creates is a sense that something is always looming just outside the strangulated frame. Whether its David Fox (Luke Wilson) his bitterly estranged wife Amy (Kate Beckinsale) or the crawlingly evil motel clerk Mason (Frank Whaley) neither they nor viewers ever seem to be alone. Of course the level of terror is proportional to the level of plausible threat and here ""Vacancy"" falls a bit short. Checking into Masons repulsively squalid inn David and Amy whose relationship is essentially over are immediately harassed by slamming on the walls and what sounds like pneumatic hammers on their door. It soon becomes clear that David and Amy have almost nothing between them and the perpetrators of the sordid crimes they find themselves watching on tapes in the rooms VCR -- which they soon realize were taped in that very same room. That the room itself would then provide sanctuary for so much of the movie not only strains belief; its laughable. And of course laughter doesnt do much for the cause of terror. At the risk of spoiling anything ""Vacancy"" is one strange movie. It ends so precipitously one can only assume its a setup for the sequel (which given all that happens seems a mite unlikely). The substantive issue to be taken with the pic however is its reliance on inexplicable cruelty and viciousness. Seldom has criminal violence been so unabashedly used for entertainment in a story in which the criminals are perpetrating violence to be sold as entertainment. Its doubtful the filmmakers were intending to deliver an oblique moral argument against their own movie but they did so all the same.
