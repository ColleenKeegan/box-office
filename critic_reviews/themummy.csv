OConnor Arnold Vosloo; Director Stephen Sommers; Author John L. Balderston Lloyd Fonvielle Kevin Jarre Nina Wilcox Putnam Richard Schayer Stephen Sommers; Producer (group) Alphaville Films Universal; Release Date Wide 05/07/1999; Runtime (in minutes) 124; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Universal Posted May 14 1999 -- 1200 AM EDT Near the ruins of Hamunaptra a tidal wave of sand cascades over the Egyptian desert and within it looms the likeness of a giant openmouthed face -- a hovering death mask. Moments later the wave and the face disintegrate into a cloud of computer-generated dust. In The Mummy an aggressively eye-popping horror film nothing remains in one shape for very long least of all the face of evil. Back in the age when monster movies took the time to be suggestive about their terrors the heroes tended to act brave and cocksure for say the first half hour or so. They may have been headed for Draculas castle or King Kongs island but since no one had a clue as to what unspeakable nightmare lay ahead everyone could afford to beam however briefly with secular confidence. In the new version of The Mummy which replaces the famous 1932 originals insidious shadowed creepiness with the spiffiest of special effects the characters start off with similar aplomb. When the monster begins to stalk though everyone stays chipper even blase and so does the movie itself. There is much to look at -- its like spending two hours in Michael Jacksons Undead Neverland -- but not a lot at stake. In The Mummy armies of waxy-shelled scarabs scurry across the floors of ancient temples attacking people in squirmy frenzied clusters. Every so often one of the pincered insects crawls beneath the skin and races around like some sort of beastly hockey puck. The Mummy himself? Hes a genuine prince of goo a glistening spindly Terminator who emerges from his sarcophagus with rotten bits of sinew dripping off his skeleton. He needs flesh lots of it to regenerate himself and he gets it by sucking the very substance out of his human victims. Rick OConnell (Brendan Fraser) a junior Indiana Jones in khakis and a puffy desert shirt doesnt seem particularly fazed by any of this. Lantern jaw raised he confronts the Mummy -- and at one point a roomful of gray-skinned zombie priests -- with shotgun blazing and sword flashing. The rambunctious physicality of Ricks derring-do is meant to be a throwaway a lighthearted joke. How scary after all could these metaphysical terrors be? Theyre old and Egyptian. Written and directed by Stephen Sommers (Deep Rising) The Mummy would like to make you shudder but it tries to do so without ever letting go of its jocular inconsequentiality. Brendan Fraser his boyishness swathed in a mane of floppy 1920s-adventurer hair is the essence of likability but he lacks Harrison Fords spark of angry gravity. Frasers facile machismo his swashbuckling detachment from the very monsters hes fighting seems to have emerged from the stop-and-look-at-this nature of the movies special effects. The Mummy wears no bandages this time but the real difference is this Hes less a character than an image. He starts out as a high priest named Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) who in a prologue set in ancient Egypt carries on a forbidden love affair with the pharaohs mistress. When the couple goes too far and murders the pharaoh guards cut out Imhoteps tongue and bury him alive in a stone coffin filled with those grisly scarabs. His rage then burns across the centuries. But in the 1932 Mummy Boris Karloff his skin like decayed papyrus played Imhotep with an evil morticians infernal glower and the movie showcased the Mummys torment as well as his vengeance. In its hushed wax-museum way it was a romance. In the new Mummy the cursed monster starts out as a glorified videogame effect and then when his flesh is restored he radiates all the menace of a shaven-headed personal trainer. The walking-corpse gimmickry is fun and I liked seeing the mummy whisk out of rooms as a tornado of sand but like the film he leaves no haunting traces. Frasers attitude of blithe fearlessness is matched by that of his sidekick/love interest (Rachel Weisz) a rosy ringlet-haired Egyptologist who when threatened with abduction admonishes Rick ""Think fast because if he turns me into a mummy youre the first one Im coming after"" This movie doesnt take anything seriously not even its title demon. Some might say thats because were no longer naive enough to harbor belief in anything as corny as the old monsters. Then again perhaps weve just lost the vision to imagine them.

Written and directed by Stephen Sommers. Starring Brendan Fraser. (PG-13. 124 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The extravagantly trashy prologue to ""The Mummy"" is the tip-off. Still it is by no means a camp ""Mummy Dearest."" This comic horror movie emphasizes the comic and Brendan Fraser is in his element. With his exaggerated features -- big eyes big nose big lips -- Fraser already looks like a comic-book hero. More importantly hes got the flair and know-how to bring it off. ""The Mummy"" digs up both laughs and chills from timeworn material. From the gilded bodies of ancient priests about to die -- they are going to be ""mummified alive"" -- to the hokey subtitles in the prologue -- what do they think they are speaking anyway old Egyptian? -- this looks as if its going to be big-time fun. It is. Flash-forward to the mid-1920s and Fraser is soldier-of-fortune Rick OConnell who gets mixed up with a librarian Egyptologist (Rachel Weisz) and several types of treasure hunters some of them high-minded some of them greedy and some merely inept. One of them is clueless enough to translate an ancient curse out loud and bring on a plague of locusts. ""The Mummy"" reanimates the creature originally brought to life by Boris Karloff in 1932. This time he is played by South African actor Arnold Vosloo (""Hard Target"") with an extraordinary boost in the horror department by the special effects of Industrial Light amp; Magic. He is one creepy creature. The Mummy at first appears to have all his flesh stripped off a sinewy skeleton that someone describes as ""still juicy."" He restores himself to functioning in this world -- and his eternal search for the kings mistress who died for him -- by recycling body parts from his victims. His eyes and tongue had been ripped out for starters. Creepiest of all may be the hordes of chattering flesh-eating beetles that periodically sweep through the treasure tomb. They really get under your skin. It takes a while but there finally is a signature shot from Karloffs original of the Mummys hand reaching up through the desert sand. Its like seeing an old friend. Fraser (""Blast From the Past"") is on a streak as far as classic movie creatures are concerned. As ""Frankenstein"" director James Whales yard man in ""Gods and Monsters"" he sympathetically and touchingly identified with the monster. In ""The Mummy"" completely different in tone he fearlessly tries to out-roar the monster and fails. Asked what he has to do he deadpans ""Rescue the damsel in distress. Kill the bad guy. Save the world."" Just when ""The Mummy"" starts to show signs of running out of steam there is a revelation of the golden treasure tomb in a spectacular piece of art direction. There is a hand-to-hand battle between Rick and the mummy priests that is a marvelous combination of choreography for Fraser and digital effects for the monsters. From the transmigration of souls to the entrance of the creature into a chamber via sand seeping through a keyhole the ILM special effects are always at the service of the storytelling. They never seem gratuitous or done merely for virtuosic display. Weisz too has a winning touch whether stoutly declaring shes ""proud to be a librarian"" or dreamily waking to a kiss that turns out to be the creatures restored lips. Weaselly Kevin J. OConnor takes full advantage of the role as second-banana villain Beni. In this breezy version of ""The Mummy"" not only do the ancients speak some mumbo-jumbo that stands for old Egyptian the curses are ungrammatical. ""Death will come on swift wings to whomever opens this chest."" That about wraps it up.

OConnor Arnold Vosloo; Director Stephen Sommers; Author John L. Balderston Lloyd Fonvielle Kevin Jarre Nina Wilcox Putnam Richard Schayer Stephen Sommers; Producer (group) Alphaville Films Universal; Release Date Wide 05/07/1999; Runtime (in minutes) 124; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Universal Posted May 14 1999 -- 1200 AM EDT Near the ruins of Hamunaptra a tidal wave of sand cascades over the Egyptian desert and within it looms the likeness of a giant openmouthed face -- a hovering death mask. Moments later the wave and the face disintegrate into a cloud of computer-generated dust. In The Mummy an aggressively eye-popping horror film nothing remains in one shape for very long least of all the face of evil. Back in the age when monster movies took the time to be suggestive about their terrors the heroes tended to act brave and cocksure for say the first half hour or so. They may have been headed for Draculas castle or King Kongs island but since no one had a clue as to what unspeakable nightmare lay ahead everyone could afford to beam however briefly with secular confidence. In the new version of The Mummy which replaces the famous 1932 originals insidious shadowed creepiness with the spiffiest of special effects the characters start off with similar aplomb. When the monster begins to stalk though everyone stays chipper even blase and so does the movie itself. There is much to look at -- its like spending two hours in Michael Jacksons Undead Neverland -- but not a lot at stake. In The Mummy armies of waxy-shelled scarabs scurry across the floors of ancient temples attacking people in squirmy frenzied clusters. Every so often one of the pincered insects crawls beneath the skin and races around like some sort of beastly hockey puck. The Mummy himself? Hes a genuine prince of goo a glistening spindly Terminator who emerges from his sarcophagus with rotten bits of sinew dripping off his skeleton. He needs flesh lots of it to regenerate himself and he gets it by sucking the very substance out of his human victims. Rick OConnell (Brendan Fraser) a junior Indiana Jones in khakis and a puffy desert shirt doesnt seem particularly fazed by any of this. Lantern jaw raised he confronts the Mummy -- and at one point a roomful of gray-skinned zombie priests -- with shotgun blazing and sword flashing. The rambunctious physicality of Ricks derring-do is meant to be a throwaway a lighthearted joke. How scary after all could these metaphysical terrors be? Theyre old and Egyptian. Written and directed by Stephen Sommers (Deep Rising) The Mummy would like to make you shudder but it tries to do so without ever letting go of its jocular inconsequentiality. Brendan Fraser his boyishness swathed in a mane of floppy 1920s-adventurer hair is the essence of likability but he lacks Harrison Fords spark of angry gravity. Frasers facile machismo his swashbuckling detachment from the very monsters hes fighting seems to have emerged from the stop-and-look-at-this nature of the movies special effects. The Mummy wears no bandages this time but the real difference is this Hes less a character than an image. He starts out as a high priest named Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) who in a prologue set in ancient Egypt carries on a forbidden love affair with the pharaohs mistress. When the couple goes too far and murders the pharaoh guards cut out Imhoteps tongue and bury him alive in a stone coffin filled with those grisly scarabs. His rage then burns across the centuries. But in the 1932 Mummy Boris Karloff his skin like decayed papyrus played Imhotep with an evil morticians infernal glower and the movie showcased the Mummys torment as well as his vengeance. In its hushed wax-museum way it was a romance. In the new Mummy the cursed monster starts out as a glorified videogame effect and then when his flesh is restored he radiates all the menace of a shaven-headed personal trainer. The walking-corpse gimmickry is fun and I liked seeing the mummy whisk out of rooms as a tornado of sand but like the film he leaves no haunting traces. Frasers attitude of blithe fearlessness is matched by that of his sidekick/love interest (Rachel Weisz) a rosy ringlet-haired Egyptologist who when threatened with abduction admonishes Rick ""Think fast because if he turns me into a mummy youre the first one Im coming after"" This movie doesnt take anything seriously not even its title demon. Some might say thats because were no longer naive enough to harbor belief in anything as corny as the old monsters. Then again perhaps weve just lost the vision to imagine them.

"Mummy The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; mummy-the ) Mummy The (United States 1999) A movie review by James Berardinelli The Mummy is pretty silly stuff. But thats okay when you consider that beneath all the action/adventure and horror trappings its actually a comedy. Think of a big-budget high profile effort in the vein of Sam Raimis Army of Darkness with less camp and better special effects. The Mummy never takes itself seriously and neither should we. Its a good thing it is funny because as a thriller its an underwhelming effort. I suppose there are times when The Mummy makes an attempt to get the adrenaline pumping but it never tries too hard. In the end its the self-mocking aura that save this film from being a waste of two hours. Despite having the same title as the 1932 Boris Karloff flick The Mummy is only a remake in the broadest sense of the word. With the exception of a few general plot details almost everything has shifted including the tone. Fans of Universals black-and-white movie may recognize the seeds of the same storyline here but nothing more. Even the characters names have been changed with one notable exception (Imhotep the high priest who is cursed to become the mummy). Its reasonable that director Stephen Sommers (Deep Rising) takes sole screenwriting credit. Following a prologue in 1290 B.C. Egypt that shows Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) being cursed and buried alive The Mummy takes us to Cairo in 1923 where British librarian Evelyn Carnarvon (Rachel Weisz far less wooden here than in Swept from the Sea) and her brother Jonathan (John Hannah from Sliding Doors) are joining American adventurer Rick OConnell (Brendan Fraser) on a trip to the lost city of Hamunaptra where they hope to discover a tomb full of treasure. Pursued by a band of fortune hunters and stalked by a cadre of mysterious black-robed nomads Rick and his small party eventually reach their destination. However their expedition turns into a disaster when they unwittingly release Imhoteps mummy. The seemingly indestructible creature has three goals release the ten Biblical plagues on Egypt regenerate itself and resurrect its long-dead lover. It quickly becomes apparent that Rick Jonathan and Evelyn (aided by a white cat) may be the only ones capable of stopping Imhoteps evil spirit. At one point Rick acknowledges that his mission is to ""rescue the damsel in distress kill the bad guy [and] save the world."" Advance quotes from studio-friendly reviewers trumpet The Mummy as being an exciting thrill-ride in the tradition of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Such statements are hyperbole. When it comes to action and adventure The Mummy is strictly routine. The movie is far too cartoonish to generate genuine tension a we never sense that any of the characters (at least the three major ones) are in real danger. Consequently The Mummys entertainment value lies in its jokey tone with Sommers script never taking its tongue out of its cheek. Almost every moment of this movie is played for fun from the barbed one-liners to an underlying sense of parody. Comparisons to Army of Darkness are apt. Ricks battles with the walking dead are often quite comical and while Brendan Fraser doesnt have the deadpan aptitude of Bruce Campbell hes still effective in a role thats an obvious lampoon of Harrison Fords Indiana Jones. The special effects are clearly state-of-the-art although theyre too obviously just that a special effects. Maybe Im becoming jaded but I knew exactly when a computer was being used and as crisp as everything looked I rarely believed in what I was seeing. The effects are not seamlessly integrated. There are plenty of examples of when the latest technology is brought to bear to enhance the visuals a swarms of bugs a storm of flaming hailstones a giant wave of wind-driven sand the walking dead etc. a but few have the kind of natural appearance that allows us to accept what we see without questioning the means by which it has been added to the frame. Another flaw in The Mummys wrapping is that its at least 30 minutes too long. The first hour drags noticeably and there are several sequences during the second half that could have been condensed. Its not surprising that the film clocks in at a little over two hours since there seems to be an unwritten rule in Hollywood that all ""event"" motion pictures must be as long as possible. Thats fine if the material warrants it but too often the padding becomes obvious. Sommers should have taken a lesson from Barry Sonnenfelds Men in Black a especially when theres a comic undertone shorter is often better. Expectations will likely color most movie-goers opinions of The Mummy. Those who buy a ticket anticipating a high-octane appetizer to The Phantom Menace will be disappointed. On the other hand those who are primed for a ludicrous adventure/horror parody will discover that The Mummy has the potential to satisfy. Considering how many would-be blockbusters fail at that simple task its possible to forgive this movie many of its numerous faults and enjoy it for what it is trying to achieve not what the marketing campaign claims it to be.

"The Mummy (PG-13) Related Item ""The Mummy"" showtimes A Humdrum Mummy By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer Friday May 7 1999 Rachel Weisz and Brendan Fraser recoil in horror of ""The Mummy."" (Universal) Director Stephen Sommers Cast Brendan Fraser; Rachel Weisz; John Hannah; Arnold Vosloo; Stephen Dunham Running Time 2 hours 5 minutes Contains violence and comedy that should be considered armed and dangerous If no earsplitting shriek scream or explosion is too loud for you if forced comedy tickles you every time if no stale romance can sully your palate and if you have never in your life seen a bandaged mummy emerge from a crypt in a movie Im thinking youre ready for ""The Mummy."" A failure in more ways than a mortal would have time to explain this overblown parody of desert epics and mummy horror films starring Brendan Fraser stumbles and screeches on for an interminable two hours. When the special effects finally come theyre too late and frankly not as great as the trailer would lead you to expect. The movie written and directed by Stephen (""Rudyard Kiplings The Jungle Book"") Sommers begins with a prologue in ancient Thebes in the way way B.C. years. Scheming high priest Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) suffers a horrible death for offending the gods by killing the Pharaoh and having an affair with his mistress. Imhotep is gutted bandaged and shoved in a coffin full of flesh-chomping bugs - and thats before they know about his involvement in this movie. The story jumps to the 1920s where dashing legionnaire Rick OConnell (Fraser) his slimy companion Beni (Kevin J. OConnor) and his fellow cloth-heads are battling a sect of guards at the site of Humunaptra (aka City of the Dead or Underground Vault of Bandaged Stiffs Lurking Menace and Mucho Treasure). This is the same place where the undead Imhotep lies in his coffin just waiting for a bunch of greedy fools to read from the Black Book of Something or Other so he can rise again and unleash 10 plagues upon Egypt. Rick and his compadres are repelled by the guardians - themselves descended protectors of the Pharaohs treasures and that really scary curse. But Rick and Beni remember the site. Three years later Rick gets his chance to return when a British scholar and librarian named Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) and her effete annoying brother Jonathan (John Hannah) save him from a hanging and enlist his help to find the City of the Dead. They have a special key to the book. They can open that book. And those special effects can finally come. The party sets off. So does a rival contingent of Americans whose intentions - of course - are more profit-oriented. This section drags on and on setting up a jousty romance between Rick and Evelyn and introducing us to the most innocuous stereotypical collection of conniving locals eccentric oddballs and greedy bounty hunters ever assembled. Fraser an incredibly likable performer valiantly attempts to maintain an air of lighthearted matinee heroism. But in the context of this movie hes just wasting his energy. ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" this aint. As they infiltrate the tomb an artificial plague of special effects rains down on them - as if attempting to distract the audience from sheer boredom. Locusts and skin-penetrating scarabs swarm in angry masses. Giant sand-cloud apparitions emerge furiously from the desert floor. Hordes of silent deadly mummies advance with vengeful intent from dusty vaults. But at this point nothing matters no matter how loud. Your brain has already become mummified.

Since then the Egyptian monster has been wrapped up in at least seven different film treatments. Now hes back. And this time hes really ticked off. But be warned if youve seen the trailer and are looking for another ""Indiana Jones And Temple Of Doom"" This movie strives for that same Saturday-matinee feeling and the results are close -- but no cigar.

Then suddenly the mysterious warriors hes fighting leave him to die in the desert. Flash forward again -- this time just a few years -- and OConnells not only still alive (surprise surprise) but hes now in prison. And about to be hanged. How? Why? Where? When? Dont know. One thing we do know The continuity and the plot for ""The Mummy"" are secondary to action and special effects. OConnell hooks up with the mandatory beautiful British woman Evelyn played by Rachel Weisz. Theres also her klutzy sidekick brother Jonathan played by John Hannah (he co-starred in ""Sliding Doors"" with Gwyneth Paltrow). Add various other neer-do-wells and were off. With little or no opposition this band of adventurers then proceeds to find the treasure wake up the title Mummy and all his mummy henchmen -- then blah blah blah action action action. Fini. Film history repeats itself ""The Mummy"" is going to enjoy a week or so of great business from curious teen-age boys and then will be buried once again -- this time by George Lucas and his gang from ""Star Wars."" Unfortunately this movie is long on swash and short on buckle. And theres a strange lack of conflict until the end when the Mummy finally starts taking names and kicking butt. Fraser is fine as an action hero with a big dose of humor and Weisz is perfectly stunning and ditsy. The effects are of course state-of-the-art. But even so after a time the mummies start looking a little cartoonish. Sorry but good acting great sets and electronic wizardry dont make up for a lack of story tension and motivation. Overall ""The Mummy"" is half-baked. Some of this film works. A lot of it doesnt. Oh well Mummy said thered be days like this. ""The Mummy"" is rated PG-13 with a running time of 123 minutes.

If not then she most certainly would not believe -- or like -- the very movie shes in as Universals attempt to find gold by bringing to new life one of the mustier items in its vaults is pure hokum and scarcely of the first order. ""I dont believe in fairy tales and hokum"" the heroine of ""The Mummy"" exclaims a short way into the proceedings. If not then she most certainly would not believe -- or like -- the very movie shes in as Universals attempt to find gold by bringing to new life one of the mustier items in its vaults is pure hokum and scarcely of the first order. This touring company ""Indiana Jones"" tries to have it both ways sending up the adventure genre for laughs while also going for some mild shocks but the sand slips through its fingers on both counts. The eye-catching ad campaign Brendan Frasers name and an abundance of effects should generate some lively opening frame business but as soon as ""Star Wars"" arrives itll be back to the sarcophagus for this one. Stephen Sommers 80 million extravaganza bears almost no relation to Karl Freunds 1932 Boris Karloff starrer or to Terence Fishers 1959 Hammer film of the same name (which toplined Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee) sharing with them only the title the idea of reviving an ancient Egyptian mummy after thousands of years and the predictable notion that you shouldnt mess with antiquity if explicit warnings of dire consequences are printed right on the box -- which in this case they are. Seven-minute prologue by no means lacks for action and melodramatic incident. In resplendent Thebes in 1290 B.C. Pharaohs mistress and her lover trusted priest Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) assassinate the Pharaoh whereupon she kills herself and he along with his cohorts suffers the proverbial fate worse than death -- hes mummified alive. Imhotep is buried deep in well-fortified Hamunaptra near a vast repository of pharaonic treasures; should Imhotep ever be liberated the prophecy goes his malevolent power will unleash 10 plagues upon Egypt. Story proper is set in the mid-1920s when Egyptology was all the rage. Devil-may-care Yank soldier-explorer Rick OConnell (Fraser) has already been to Hamunaptra in battle but hes about to be hanged in Cairo for his general meddlesomeness when hes rescued from the noose by the attractive young Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) a bumbling librarian from the Museum of Antiquities who evidently for want of better company pals around with her maladroit brother Jonathan (John Hannah). Joined by the greedy prison warden they all set out down the Nile for the legendary burial site whose location only Rick knows. But they have competition from some gung-ho American cowboy fortune hunters and adversaries in the form of some fierce black-garbed natives whose ancestors have been watching the site since before Moses day to make sure that Imhotep stays put. But once all the Yanks and Brits turn up its a safe bet that the old boy wont remain cooped up for much longer. And this being the age of CGI one can be assured that the mummy will assume numerous forms. Upon first seeing light of day hes a crusty old skeleton with an unusual amount of tissue left on him for a 3000-year-old and a way of roaring at everyone that puts him in the same family with the stars of the ""Alien"" and ""Jurassic Park"" pictures. As he dispatches victims he acquires what he needs from them -- eyes a tongue teeth more skin and so on until hes entirely restored and all but invulnerable; like a vampire Imhotep has his vulnerabilities -- hes scared of cats -- but this bit is introduced only to be immediately forgotten. Also threatening any interloper at Hamunaptra are some large ancient bugs that havent eaten in centuries and have a way of getting under peoples skin. Imhotep doesnt hesitate to deliver on the promised plagues -- waves of insects a firestorm and a solar eclipse are just his initial offerings -- but fortunately Rick is good with guns and a sword and the Brits come through in a pinch so the good guys have a fighting chance after all. Unfortunately nearly every element in Sommers by-the-numbers screenplay feels concocted merely to provide the excuse for another effect moment of imperilment or miraculous rescue. Any number of scenes has the clutzy but brainy Evelyn rapidly translating ancient Egyptian in order to figure out a solution to something and various items such as keys have a way of turning up whenever needed. Plot developments here stem strictly from convenience not from conviction or logic and pic fails to deliver any genuine sense of spirit or fun. The stabs at comedy are lame and Sommers cant even come up with any amusing quips for Fraser and company to toss off as they handle crises with aplomb; dialogue in general is very feeble. At the same time scary moments are the cheating kind with mummies and such suddenly popping up from out of frame and arent scary anyway. Pic is loaded with action and incident but generates zero suspense or surprise. Thesps have been directed to broad undisciplined performances. Fraser is physically and temperamentally ideal for this sort of swashbuckling leading role but he like the film itself never quite finds the proper seriocomic pitch. Buffoonery hardly seems like Weiszs natural domain as the actress strains for comic effects that she cant achieve while Hannah is markedly over the top. Special effects are numerous and accomplished and while the mummy look itself is something new and a few other shots are nifty -- the computer-created vistas of ancient Egypts heyday and the marching sword-clanging mummy soldiers toward the end look sharp -- most of the effects have a rather familiar appearance. Shot on Moroccan locations and London interiors pic has been attractively bathed in golden hues by lenser Adrian Biddle and tech credits in general are lavish. Jerry Goldsmiths heavy ever-present score has a deadening effect on the action however and has to rate as one of the worst of his long and distinguished career.
