Canadian filmmaker Don McKellar thats who since his 1999 movie Last Night ticked all the boxes left unchecked by this latest pre-apocalyptic twist on a tired date-movie formula.The end is nigh once more when a massive asteroid heads towards us and fortysomething insurance-selling nerd Steve Carell is facing oblivion on his tod. His missus has done a runner prompting the realisation that a long-gone old girlfriend was actually the love of his life. As law and order breaks down he hits the road to find her taking along his newly single neighbour Keira Knightley a ditsy narcoleptic with a thing about old vinyl records. And yes you did read that last phrase right.Where Lars von Trier made striking use of a similar scenario to explore the skewed moral perspectives of the manic depressive in Melancholia here the destruction of all life on Earth is just a plot device to get this oddest of couples into each others arms. Writer-director Lorene Scafaria brings nothing new to the on-screen depiction of the end of days - even if the movies best moment comes right at the beginning with a choice gag at the expense of classic rock radio. And when it comes to emotional resonance the movie is totally unable to sell the ultra-reserved charisma-free character played by Carell as a guy youd want to spend your final hours with.Meanwhile hard-working Knightley is defeated by the contrivance of her role. Though its clear were meant to be moved by the big finale the sight of these two together is so unsettling its hard not to start rooting for the asteroid.

Yes its a romcom so suspend all disbelief about the availability of fuel and electricity at the end of the world. Steve Carells character is supposed to be flat so I had no problems there; neither did I have any problems believing that Keira Knightleys character would fall for him given the circumstances.

First 20 mins is good last 25 mins are better. All in all opportunity missed to make somrthing better with the plot. Knightley does a great job at carrying the movie along but otherwise a fairly boring movie.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJul 14 2012IanFeaturedI agree with Archgate Knightly is very good. If you can bear to sit through 45 minutes of what is a very poor first half where apart from the excellent gag in the opening scene there is little of merit you will be rewarded. Carell really doesnt have either the looks nor the gravitas to carry of what evolves from being a poor movie with lots of people you really wouldnt want to meet or know into what is a very good second half as the film becomes a road trip to self discovery. It has an excellent soundtrack topped off by two beautiful scenes firstly to a Hollies track and then the piece de resistance of an epiphany to Scott Walkers greatest 3 minutes. Sit through the first hour and a quarter for a beautiful last 15 minutes. The first half deserves one star. The last 15 minutes 5. I will gives it 3 for a last quarter of an hour where if you dont cry at least once you must be emotionally dead.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map },http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/93261/seeking-a-friend-for-the-end-of-the-world.html,200,seekingafriendfortheendoftheworld0,seekingafriendfortheendoftheworld,timeout

If you have then you will most likely appreciate and think often of this story. If you have not then you likely will echo the sentiments of the negative reviewers. Susan Butchkosaid on Friday November 16 2012 50620 PMI loved this movie but you didnt tell me Id be sobbing Wadesaid on Sunday August 05 2012 75950 PMNever got a chance to catch this one in theaters. Looking forward to it. Great review Richard. adrianasaid on Tuesday July 10 2012 30112 PMI also loved this movie Check out my review Mark H.said on Monday July 02 2012 122632 PMRichard I share your sentiments about this movie almost. I loved the shit out of the second half of this movie The first half is a blend of satire comedy and drama that doesnt always work. When the film finally decides to be an earnest emotional tearjerker it succeeds to the very (terrific) end. darcisaid on Monday July 02 2012 42333 AMSo the last time I saw a Keira Knightley movie I couldnt even finish it because it was so bad (London Boulevard) but this one was much better. Although the tone shifts a little too dramatically a couple times the movies charm and dark humor won me over plus Steve Carell and Knightley actually surprised me by having some great chemistry. Carell really can do the sad-sack character well. One thing I was disappointed with was the music especially considering this movie was from the creator of Nick amp; Norahs Infinite Playlist which is about as good as it gets when it comes to tunes. ""Wouldnt It Be Nice"" by The Beach Boys of course is awesome but has been used countless times already so really the only song I was really thrilled with was ""Sex Tourists"" by French Kicks which SPOILER ALERT is the song that plays right when Dodge + Penny drive off after having sex. I was expecting more great under-the-radar tunes like this but the movie was still good and I love French Kicks so much that their inclusion was almost enough to make up for it. Jessicasaid on Friday June 29 2012 125152 AMI completely agree with you. I Loved this movie I think people who hated it are either crazy or afraid to feel anything. Joelsaid on Wednesday June 27 2012 90617 AMRichard I am usually right with you on your reviews but man I disagree on this one. What I thought started out promising as a indie comedy/drama turned into this weird sap-fest. The beach scene may have been the scene that really put the nail in the coffin for this movie. I find it strange that you believed this romance that developed between Carrell and Knightley because to me it came out of left field. The ending really pissed me off as well in regards to knightleys decision. The final 40 minutes made me want to puke which left a really bad taste in my mouth. Johnie Busasaid on Monday June 25 2012 92526 AMI have to be honest I was not expecting this much from Lorene Scafaria the writer and director of this film. The last piece of work she put out there was Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist and it bombed. However with a movie as thought provoking and meaningful as this one I may have to forgive her for the past. I will be excited to see her next work and I hope she will do as good of a job as she did on this movie. Seeking a Friend for the End of the World is a movie you dont want to end. While you can predict the ending and a lot of the plot its a great story and you are always hoping in the back of your mind that it will not conclude. Steve Carell seems to be capable of playing anything these days whether its Brick in anchorman Cal from Crazy Stupid Love or Dodge from this film. He has shown that he can be the idiot the family man or out of touch just trying to find hope. Keira Knightley of course does a great job. If I had to rank actresses from todays films she would probably make my top ten list. The supporting cast is neither good nor bad but with the story revolving around Carell and Knightley trying to cling to their last days on earth the supporting cast doesnt really matter. The film was great; the storyline was fantastic and what I like most of all is you leave the theater feeling that you need to do more with your life before its over.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post When ""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World"" begins the end is nigh. Seriously. Final efforts to avert an asteroid collision have failed and the countdown to cataclysmic impact begins in earnest. Making popcorn entertainment out of humankinds demise is a bad habit Hollywood cant seem to break. (Whaddya think all those improved special effects were for? ) But this dramedy starring Steve Carell and Keira Knightley as Dodge and Penny neighbors who embark on a sentimental journey keeps it authentic not with digitally rendered images of disaster but with believable messy emotion. Written and directed by Lorene Scafaria ""Seeking a Friend"" is poignant achingly compassionate and often very funny. Although the events that transpire are fictional theres something brilliantly observed going on here. Lets face it there would probably be as many individual responses to an end we see coming as there are differentiated snowflakes. When Dodges wife hears the news on the radio she bolts from their car and their lives. The next day a staff meeting at the insurance company where Dodge works suggests that for every person that makes a break for it theres another who keeps punching the clock. Indeed the movie is a study in post-Powerball behavior. Only the apocalypse is the lotterys opposite. The movies most persistent question is When your numbers up do you flee your quotidian existence stick to your routine or try to right and rewrite what you can? Pennys ex Speck (Derek Luke) offers yet another alternative. With less than a month to go Dodge doesnt look to be going anywhere. This changes when he meets neighbor Penny (Knightley). Shes kicking herself that she didnt fly home to Britain to be with her parents before flights were grounded. She offers to help Dodge locate his first and true love. He offers to take her to someone who may be able to fly her home. Their roadtrip is less fraught with danger than rife with strange characters. And counter to what one might fear how much of a love story their journey will be is not annoyingly obvious. Carell is at his best here measured melancholy and utterly nimble with the tossed-off line. The unhinged comedy is left to others. Local guy made good T.J. Miller portrays a manager at a restaurant chain called Friendsys that has decided to welcome the end and any customers with a cheery if Bacchanalian embrace. It no doubt helps the movies tone that neither Dodge nor Penny have children. Not just because it leaves open the possibility of a romance but because being a parent as the world comes to an end isnt comedy or dramedy but just pure unadulterated tragedy. Still Dodge does pick up a cute mutt along the way. ""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World"" may not be a perfect film whatever that elusive beast is. For instance theres something vexing about the interactions between Dodge and his dedicated housekeeper Elsa (Tonita Castro). Should we understand this sweetly smiling womans continued weekly visits as an expression of cluelessness or of faith or of something else entirely? (She does wear a small crucifix.) In this very secular take on The End it would be nice to know if her doggedness was Scafarias small nod to the issue of faith. Instead their exchanges feel played for laughs about the language barrier. This is an exceedingly promising directorial debut for Scafaria who adapted the winning romance ""Nick amp; Norahs Infinite Playlist."" There was only one thing she could have done to ruin her films brave conceit. What an ironic joy that she doesnt. ""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World"" has a deep impact.

Last year moviegoers watched as two planet-sized objects hurtled towards the Earth. One meant the end of the world as we know it; the other just the end of the world. In Mike Cahills Another Earth a carbon copy of our planet approached from points unknown and ended up taking up orbit in the sky as those on our world discovered that the twin Earth had alternate versions of themselves. Lars Von Triers extended metaphor on the nature of depression Melancholia had a more apocalyptic finality that films eponymous globe didnt put on the brakes as it neared slamming squarely into Earth like a cue ball on the break.For an actor the worlds looming end is like an emotional green screen providing a mental challenge akin to the physical one facing performers in big special-effects movies. These were films with massive potential cosmic cataclysms but they werent really about the cataclysms themselves. Armageddon Now theres a movie where a cigar is just a cigar where the huge asteroid on an intercept course with the planet is nothing more and nothing less than whats advertised. But those two films last year used the uncertainty and impending doom of their heavenly bodies as a catalyst for examining what goes on inside much tinier globes our own heads. Thats also the case for the directorial debut of screenwriter Lorene Scafaria Seeking a Friend for the End of the World. As the film opens an Armageddon-style rescue mission is failing Dodge (Steve Carell) and his wife sit parked in their car listening to a radio announcer reporting on the catastrophic defeat of a shuttle mission to divert an asteroid currently on track to collide with the Earth. With that failure the countdown starts on the last 21 days before all life on the planet is eradicated. Dodges wife opens the door and runs away never to be seen again. Scafaria spends much of the first half of the film having fun with this what-if scenario. Just what would happen to our day-to-day lives if the entirety of existence had a kitchen timer ticking its way to the ding of oblivion? How long would people still go to their jobs? How long would the news broadcasts continue? When would the rioting start? Would middle-class suburbanites get their kids drunk and try out heroin and orgies just for the hell of it? All of these questions are addressed with a gleefully irreverent eye towards the gallows including the movies central question Are love companionship and family cold comforts in the waning moments of our lives or something significant and meaningful? Our annual guide to the modest ideas that can change the world See full coverage Nearly everyone in the film is grappling with this problem in their own way. Patton Oswalt cameos as an opportunistic schlub sleeping with a different woman every day claiming that the apocalypse has leveled the playing field for formerly loveless cretins like himself. Diane (Connie Britton) wants to fix Dodge up with her desperate friend Karen (Melanie Lynskey) so that he wont have to die alone. Her husband Warren (Rob Corddry) has a more existential attitude Dodge wont die alone hell just die with everybody else. Warren is also constantly drunk and feels more love for the rare cigars he plans to spend his last days smoking than for his wife or family. But Dodge ends up fleeing the city with his downstairs neighbor Penny (Keira Knightley) who has just broken up with reconciled and re-broken up with her slacker of a boyfriend. Dodge wants to go find the one that got away Penny wants to find a way to get back to England to see her family (all commercial air traffic has been grounded).Its here that the film begins to take a (sometimes clumsy) tonal shift from comedy to serious drama. At the end of the day theres nothing really funny about the end of the world and the laughs begin to drain out as the hourglass nears empty. In films like this the apocalyptic backdrop provides convenient nudging for characters to engage in whatever reflection a filmmaker wants from them but it also is necessarily contrived and artificial. The challenge if the goal is to make the exercise meaningful is to keep these characters honest even within the self-consciously false structure thats been built around them. For an actor this must be in some ways a variation on what performers in big special-effects movies must do physically. Its like an emotional green screen. Where the effects-movie actor moves on a soundstage while being told the general position size and shape of the dinosaur or alien that is attacking them the apocalypse-as-metaphor actor imagines the ramifications on the psyche of the unseen doom approaching. When Another Earth worked (which it did less for me than for a lot of viewers) it was largely on the strength of Brit Marlings heavily internal performance as a woman racked with guilt and wrestling with the possibility that another version of her whod taken a different path was living happily up there somewhere. The planet of Melancholia in Von Triers film is the big overbearing metaphor for depression but its Kirsten Dunsts performance as the depressed that sells it that makes that planet simply a manifestation of her own hopeless mind.

Abraham Lincolns Weird Pop-Culture Legacy Our Picks for Which Film to Catch Each Week of Summer Scafaria is fortunate then to have Carell and Knightley here. Carrells hit this territory before Theres a profoundly sad center to many of his comic characters whether in Dan in Real Life and Little Miss Sunshine or even The Offices Michael Scott. Here he plays a man wrestling with the connections (and lack thereof) that hes made and broken in his life and his performance is understated and elegant helping the movie along when it isnt quite as sure-footed. Knightley meanwhile plays a free-spirited sprite who easily could have descended into lazy Manic-Pixie-Dream-Girl territory. Except that Penny doesnt exist in the movies universe just to aid Dodge. These two poke at each other equally and their odd-couple routine is just that that of a couple rather than a quirky girl awakening a dull guy. The genuine sweetness of the friendship that develops between these two wins out over any of the movies failingsPerhaps the clustering of apocalypse films is a reflection of a prevailing climate of pessimism or maybe its the debunked-but-still-talked-about Mayan 2012 prophecy. But chances are films like these will always be with us. After all as humans this life is all we have. End-times movies have the potential to be so affecting because no matter how big the object coming to destroy us nothing is bigger than the universe inside our own minds and no gravitational pull feels as strong as the imagined ones we share with those we love most intensely.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed.

When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion. Continue Reading carianoff/flickr Why Some People Respond to Stress by Falling Asleep Elijah Wolfson Fight or flight or sleep Last month my wife and I found ourselves in a disagreement about whether or not our apartment was clean enough for guests--the type of medium-sized disagreement that likely plagues all close relationships. In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

"Seeking a Friend (for a ride to South Jersey) at the End of the World |       NJ.com comments Seeking a Friend (for a ride to South Jersey) at the End of the World Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on June 22 2012 at 730 AM View/Post Comments Darren MichaelsSteve Carell stars as Dodge in ""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World."" Its the end of the world. The reason doesnt matter -- rogue planets asteroids ancient Mayan prophecies -- the fact is its here. Now the only question is How are you going to go out? Its been a recurring movie question lately and the general answers been -- not well. ""2012"" had the 1 percent grabbing the only tickets out of town; ""Melancholia"" showed families falling apart; ""444 Last Day on Earth"" starred bitter artists holing up in their apartments. ""Contagion"" (although it averted the disaster in the end) featured paranoia and martial law. ""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World"" takes a more upbeat downbeat approach. When the movie starts the world has three weeks left -- and our hero Dodges marriage has just ended abruptly. He has no children and hasnt spoken to his father in years. His job now defines pointlessness -- really selling insurance during the apocalypse? -- and his friends have embraced who-cares hedonism. And so Dodge decides to do something completely innocent and romantic and probably pointless. He seeks out his high school sweetheart. You may think you know how this is going to work out as the film embraces a few cliches early on (yes there is a ""kooky"" young female character whos here to wake Dodge up to life). Yet it takes so many other interesting twists. All are clearly due to director and screenwriter Lorene Scafaria a Garden Stater who already gave us some shout-outs in her adaptation of ""Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist."" She hits some obvious notes in this directorial debut but also comes up with some wonderfully odd riffs. Theres the trip to a chain restaurant for example where the happy-to-serve-you staff have decided to stage a 24-hour bacchanal. Or the suburban party where the new nihilists shed their business suits to do hard drugs and get little kids blotto like a ""Mad Men"" episode guest-directed by Roman Polanski. But mostly theres Penny the narcoleptic neighbor whom Dodge ends up taking his romantic road trip with. She is a woman of many retro loves -- Converse sneakers vinyl the Tijuana Brass. Also -- that most old-fashioned love of all -- love itself. Keira Knightley who rarely gets a chance to play contemporary roles let alone comedy is marvelously winning as Penny all sharp elbows and dark laughter. And Steve Carell is fine too as Dodge (although he needs to mix it up more in his career -- the part feels like another in a long line of self-pitying sad sacks). But what really helps these actors shine is that Scafaria gives them the room to find these characters and their rhythm together as they take a truck and head toward South Jersey. And she gives us enough credit to provide a story without too many bizarre coincidences unbelievable twists or unsatisfyingly ""satisfying"" endings. Instead she very simply and rather bravely delivers a movie thats exactly about what the title says its going to be about -- searching for a bit of human contact while we still can. A movie that may be in its own small weird way the most bizarrely bittersweet and oddly beautiful romance youve seen in quite awhile. Ratings note The film contains strong language drug and alcohol abuse and violence. Seeking a Friend for the End of the World (R) Focus (94 min.) Directed by Lorene Scafaria.

(AP Photo/Focus Features Darren Michaels) ""This is the way the world ends"" poet T.S. Eliot wrote. ""Not with a bang but a whimper.""For reasons that are so obvious that storytellers have stopped mentioning them the apocalypse is all the rage. Survivalists are counting the days until the rapture or the Mayan meltdown and last year we had two separate movies about astronomical annihilation (""Another Earth"" and ""Melancholia"").An asteroid is the off-screen bad guy in ""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World"" but the problem with this nice-try comedy is the nice-guy protagonist. Steve Carell as a whimpering white suburbanite who hunts for a lost love while the clock runs down is a black hole that sucks the satirical juice from the movie. Carell is Dodge an East Coast insurance agent whose wife leaves him on the eve of destruction. While his yuppie friends fornicate and snort heroin (a wickedly funny touch) Dodge wonders what ever happened to his first love Olivia.As the faceless masses finally make a cameo appearance in his neighborhood Dodge stages a hasty getaway with Penny (Keira Knightley) the free spirit from the apartment downstairs who has a car and an armload of vintage vinyl to wile away the hours.Although this is supposedly a road movie it doesnt go very far. In a nearby town Penny stops to visit old flame Speck (Derek Luke) a solider with a stockpile of weapons and potato chips in his bunker while Dodges journey gets diverted into a subplot about his estranged father (Martin Sheen). Working with a limited budget writer-director Lorene Scafaria eschews special effects for injections of dark humor a deadpan newscaster who reminds viewers to change their clocks; a cheerful chain restaurant where the staff gobbles Ecstasy and gropes the customers; and especially Knightleys explanatory spiel to a cop about the bloody truck they inherited from an assassinated trucker. That soliloquy is sharper than any scene in co-star Carells last six movies.If the world were really coming to an end wed spend it with Knightley and tell her tag-along friend that theres not enough food for a 50-year-old virgin.

A giant asteroid is fast approaching and since this isnt Armageddon or some other block-blustery conceit we cant rely on a superhero to save us from certain extinction.Instead humankind has raised the white flag leaving news anchors to adjust their plastic smiles and count down ""the end of days"" - 21 to be precise. Yet not to worry. In Seeking a Friend for the End of the World the times may be hard but the apocalypse is soft. Welcome to the anti-Melancholia. Multimedia Seeking a Friend for the End of the World the official trailer Steve Carell image from CP Fresh Flicks video. CP Movies Video Steve Carell hits the box office this weekend And welcome back to Lorene Scafaria. When we last met Lorene she had written the quick-witted script for Nick amp; Norahs Infinite Playlist.Now shes directing too but even though the infinite has turned precariously finite here her tone hasnt changed - once again laughs head the agenda. Early on the comedy is black and abundant and at best wickedly funny. With cosmic nature throwing up a global disaster human nature reacts as it always has - variously.Some folks go wild others get weak; survivalists resist fatalists relent. As for earnest Dodge (Steve Carell) he continues to clock in at the insurance office where his manager that most optimistic of species gives the encroaching darkness a happy spin ""Feel free to wear casual attire pretty much every day of the week.""Thats the delight of these early scenes - the mining of imminent tragedy for nuggets of comic absurdity. Outside its raining suicides - splat a jumper lands on a car windshield - but the radio traffic reports drone on about the same old gridlock. Inside after learning that his wife abruptly flew the coop Dodge heads off to a house party where the revels are in full swing. Sex is rampant hitherto diligent parents are offering their 10-year-olds shots of tequila and in lieu of the chardonnay ""Sue and Dave brought heroin."" Conversely dullards to the bitter end the less imaginative cut loose less imaginatively ""Im finally going to take that pottery class.""Unfortunately the keenest fun ends when the plot begins. Penny the blithe spirit (Keira Knightley) pops up in Dodges dour ambit and the odd couple hit the open highway whereupon a disaster movie morphs into a road movie and a black comedy into a romance comedy. Naturally episodic adventures ensue but the payoffs prove more intermittent and less rewarding than the premise. A visit to a friendly bar called Friendsys merely echoes the previous party scene but without the same kick. An encounter with a band of survivalists gives Penny a chance to place a satellite call to her parents in distant England and the picture awkwardly pauses for a poignant-moment tableau. And an 11th-hour reconciliation scene with Dodges father (Martin Sheen) is just forced schmaltz - some things are better never than late.Still not all the amusement is gone. Cast against type Knightley is a likeable ditz; cast to type Carell is an equally likeable loser and if the two fail to generate any real chemistry they at least sustain our rooting interest. En route he takes along a rescued dog to up the cute quotient while she totes a stack of her precious vinyl a playlist of actual records in search of an actual record player. When its found with the seconds ticking down bet that The Sun Aint Gonna Shine (Anymore) is No.1 with a bullet.Such is the frustration here a movie that veers from trenchant to predictable from satire to sentimentality. Scafaria seems to get disoriented by her own scenario boxing herself into an apocalypse whose initial absurdities feel so wonderfully right but where to go from there? When the lights are out and the partys over the End still demands an ending - maybe a bang or perhaps a whimper but surely not warm-and-fuzzy. Nope not even a superhero would stoop to that.

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A button-down depressive meets a fun-loving eccentric on the eve of the apocalypse. BOTTOM LINE A frustratingly uneven comedy-drama that starts out smart and incisive but ends up safe and cozy. CAST Steve Carell Keira Knightley Derek Luke LENGTH 141 ""Hire An Assassin"" reads a flyer on a wall in ""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World"" a mordantly funny if ultimately uneven comedy-drama about a late-blooming romance. That unsavory but undeniably tempting offer isnt a major plot point merely a small detail. If only there were more of them in this directorial debut from screenwriter Lorene Scafaria (""Nick amp; Norahs Infinite Playlist""). Set three weeks before the apocalypse ""Seeking a Friend"" stars Steve Carell as Dodge a joyless insurance salesman recently deserted by his wife (Carells real-life spouse seen briefly). Around him chaos reigns Couple-friends are uncorking long-bottled fantasies (Robb Corddry and Patton Oswalt play newly minted debauchees) while at work theres sudden upward mobility as colleagues plummet to their deaths. More mundanely ""I think Ill finally take that pottery class"" says Dodges friend Karen (Melanie Lynskey). Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? This collapsing society is so inventive and colorful and such ghastly fun that youll wish the narrative didnt have to start. But soon Dodge takes a road trip with his kooky 28-year-old neighbor Penny (Keira Knightley). Hes looking for an old flame she needs a flight to England but we know where this is going. Pit stops include the bunker of an enigmatic survivalist (Derek Luke) and the worlds friendliest Friendlys where the food and love are free (a terrific sequence thats almost a movie in itself). Despite Scafarias opening salvo of sharp observations and daringly grim jokes ""Seeking a Friend"" eventually gives into false comfort. Carells Dodge is a self-obsessed bummer but Knightleys hip young Penny inexplicably falls for him anyway. (Her speech about old vinyl having deeper grooves doesnt wash; its swiped from Paul Giamattis Pinot monologue in ""Sideways."") Its too bad the movie chose to go so gentle into that good night. PLOT A button-down depressive meets a fun-loving eccentric on the eve of the apocalypse. RATING R (language adult themes) VideoTrailer Seeking a Friend for the End of the World CAST Steve Carell Keira Knightley Derek Luke advertisement | advertise on newsday LENGTH 141 PLAYING AT Area theaters BOTTOM LINE A frustratingly uneven comedy-drama that starts out smart and incisive but ends up safe and cozy.

Given the flood of apocalyptic films inspired by the arrival of 2012 -- the Mayans predicted end of days -- it was pretty much inevitable someone would try to give the subject a comic twist. The feeble darkish comedy ""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World has its laughs but pretty much every single one of them is in the trailer. And even more unfortunately the improbable new romantic comedy team of Steve Carell and Keira Knightley works about as well as youd guess -- like oil and water. Carell does most of the heavy comic lifting as a sad sack named Dodge who jokes that hes ""getting my midlife crisis in just under the wire. When its announced that a space mission to stop an asteroid from hitting Earth (shades of ""Armageddon and ""Deep Impact) has failed Dodges wife runs off with a man with whom shes already been having an affair. Our hero continues quixotically reporting for work as an insurance salesman -- in an office where casual dress is now welcome every day and a volunteer is sought to serve as CFO -- at least until a suicide lands on his windshield at his rooftop parking spot. The movies biggest surprise comes when were told Dodge is supposed to live in New York City -- nothing in this movie shot in Southern California looks remotely like an East Coast location (especially that rooftop parking spot). Knightley plays Penny a ditsy neighbor in his apartment building who turns up on his fire escape after a fight with her boorish boyfriend. After a singularly unconvincing riot the bickering new couple take off for an equally implausible New Jersey. Dodge offers to provide Penny with a wildly improbable means to pay a last visit to her parents in England. And along the way he hopes to reconnect with a high-school sweetheart whose letter from a year earlier is turned over to him by Penny. Along the way they have sex -- a perfunctory scene that appears to be as embarrassing for the actors as their characters -- witness a suicide or two visit a family restaurant with a giddy staff and develop whats supposed to be a real last-minute relationship. The lack of chemistry between the two leads doesnt really allow for this possibility even with Knightleys considerable skill as a dramatic actor. The film wastes such formidable laugh-getters as Patton Oswalt (virtually his entire role is in the trailer) and Rob Corddry while ladling on the schmaltz in a climactic sequence with Martin Sheen as Dodges long-estranged father. Screenwriter Lorene Scafaria (the similarly fey ""Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist) is over her head in her feature directing debut unable to establish a consistent tone in a movie that flirts with black comedy satire romantic comedy and touchy-feely earnestness without really delivering any of them. ""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World is at best the sort of innocuously amusing comedy that would suffice as a video rental. As a radio announcer puts it ""Well be bringing you a countdown to the end of days along with all your classic rock favorites.

Accompanying him on the road trip is his lonely neighbor (Keira Knightley). Starring Keira Knightley Steve Carell Connie Britton Melanie Lynskey T.J. Miller Adam Brody Gillian Jacobs Patton Oswalt William Petersen Derek Luke Director Lorene Scafaria Release Opened Jun 22 2012  Editorial Review The end is near if a bit contrivedBy Ann HornadayFriday June 22 2012""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World"" is a strange little movie. Unsure whether it wants to be a quirky sad-eyed indie pixie or a brassy raunchy broad it veers uneasily between the two never quite settling into a comfortable or recognizable groove. Written by Lorene Scafaria who makes her directorial debut ""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World"" possesses a conceit just as high-concept as her 2008 rom-com ""Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist."" In this case an asteroid is hurtling toward Earth due to arrive in just a couple of weeks. When Dodge (Steve Carell) hears the news on his car radio his wife takes off. After a few nights consoling himself with codeine-laced cough syrup and memories he meets a goofy neighbor named Penny (Keira Knightley) with whom he spends his final days on a road trip designed to make good on their own personal bucket lists. Scafaria gets things off to a cynical raucous start homing in on jokes about an ""end-of-the-world awareness concert"" and flyers advertising assassins (""Tired of waiting for the end of the world?""). A friend of Dodges played by Rob Corddry throws a party where he serves alcohol to his kids welcomes a guest bearing heroin and indulges in unsafe fireworks lighting. Its all very nihilistic and hard-edged a tone that doesnt quite jibe with Carells sincere sad-eyed despond. When he joins forces with Penny -- a daffy hipster chick with a love of vinyl and Converse All-Stars -- the fit isnt much neater although the two share some genuinely sweet moments. Tonally ""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World"" faces the same challenge as ""Zombieland"" which fared much better in trying to balance the volatile elements of apocalyptic chaos wacky comedy and budding romance. Unlike that film this one never creates a believable world -- a task made all the more important when that world is on the verge of annihilation. (Dodge and Pennys story supposedly takes place in New Jersey but I swear I spied a passing palm tree on their travels.) By the time the all-too-convenient plot twist shows up in the third act the air of contrivance is positively stifling but Carell and Knightley still manage to wring pathos and warmth from the artificial setup and the films conclusion arrives with a thudding maudlin wallop. Even that moment follows a bizarre darkly funny joke during which a newscaster reminds his viewers to ""spring forward."" Are we supposed to laugh or cry? Scafarias answer presumably is yes -- but it takes a more sure-handed director to make that clear.Contains profanity including sexual references some drug use and brief violence.

By its conclusion we see that those turns in the road were essential in helping us empathize with and root for the lead characters.MORE Seeking a Friend red carpet reportIf the performances of Steve Carell and Keira Knightley werent so superb director Lorene Scafarias wryly funny screenplay might not have been enough to captivate audiences. But with their combined efforts the tale of two ordinary people thrust into an extraordinary situation is wonderfully poetic though still grounded in reality.The film is set in the near future when an asteroid is on a collision course with Earth. Scientists final attempt to counter its cataclysmic crash has failed. The end is all too near.About the movieSeeking a Friend for the End of the World1/2 out of fourStars Steve Carell Keira Knightley Adam Brody Martin Sheen Director Lorene Scafaria Distributor Focus Features Rating R for language including sexual references some drug use and brief violence Running time 1 hour 40 minutes Opens today nationwideBut Dodge (Carell) a mild-mannered insurance salesman continues to go into his office and carry out his daily routine with joyless determination. Only a smattering of employees rattle around. At a meeting a supervisor asks ""Anyone want to be CFO? In the opening scene his wife leaves him bolting from a car following a breaking news report announcing Earths demise in 21 days.The aptly named Dodge resists the efforts of his friends to draw him into reckless behavior. ""Sarah and Dave brought heroin"" Diane (Connie Britton) gleefully announces at a party. It seems plausible that all bets would be off when it comes to illegal or dangerous pursuits. Dodge however has never been the carpe diem sort.His neighbor Penny (Knightley) is Dodges polar opposite. Shes sprightly and adorable with a wistful quality underlying her extroversion. But in her flightiness she forgets to pass on a letter to Dodge mistakenly delivered to her. When Penny learns that it was from his first love and might have changed his life shes determined to rectify her mistake.Dodges inherent decency -- heightened by the urgency of riots breaking out -- propels him to offer a sort of last-days trade As Penny pledges to help him seek out his long-lost love hell help her get to England to see her parents. Only in such an extreme situation would these two people come together but they do in a way that is poignant and hopeful amid the bleak scenario.TV news provides background noise. One program highlights ""The Best of Humanity"" with a list including Jesus and Oprah.This is a romantic comedy for people who dont like rom-coms. Theres no chance of a happy ending but its tender mercies speak volumes. Its the warmly intimate moments the bittersweet wonder at the beauty of the world and the value of family and forgiveness that leave the deepest imprint.Its the end of the world as Dodge and Penny know it but for a time they feel fine.

Keira Knightley stars as Penny and Steve Carell stars as Dodge in Lorene Scafarias SEEKING A FRIEND FOR THE END OF THE WORLD a Focus Features release. Photo Darren Michaels Focus Features Seeking a Friend for the End of the World 1 / 1 Back to Gallery ""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World"" a half-tender portrait of two very lonely hearts in the closing weeks of humanitys run on Earth is a strange movie. Its strange because Steve Carell almost never cracks a smile - not much beyond his eyes which convey a sadness and a soulfulness last fully realized in ""Little Miss Sunshine."" Its also strange because writer-director Lorene Scafaria shifts tone midway - straight from withering cynicism and apocalyptic-orgy gags to honeyed meditations on life death the one who got away and the fickle timing of Eros. Carell plays Dodge a defeated insurance salesman whose wife (played by Carells real-life wife Nancy) bolts from the car and his life when a radio DJ announces that ""the final mission to save mankind has failed"" and then segues into the Beach Boys ""Wouldnt It Be Nice."" Twenty-one days before a 70-mile-wide asteroid is scheduled to cream the planet Dodge finds himself terribly and definitively alone. This is the films most interesting convincing and darkly comical stretch this period of disorientation as Dodge shows up for work and putters through his life in the absence of hope. Carell being Carell theres a thin film of fatigued moral irony lining Dodges gaze as the folks around him throw scruples to the wind and greet Armageddon as an excuse for Boschian excess. And then theres Penny the blithe spirit played by Keira Knightley in one of her least-affected performances. She shows up weeping at Dodges window right when hes mooning over a lost love. Soon they embark on a pre-apocalyptic road trip He to find his beloved she to see her family in Britain. The light in her eyes and the moistness in his tell you all you need to know about their quest. Sweet and serious as it is the second chunk of ""Seeking a Friend"" is the lesser of the two - and hard to reconcile with the more acidic comic outlook in the films first half. The obvious movie referent is Lars von Triers ""Melancholia"" a much nastier film in a much lovelier wrapping This one lacks an eight-minute Wagner montage.   Seeking a Friend for the End of the World Dark comedy. Starring Steve Carell and Keira Knightley. Directed by Lorene Scafaria. (R. 101 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.)

Bring on the meteor Theres a great movie about the imminent destruction of the planet and how it affects a group of people and their search for family bonds sexual thrills and even momentary connections with total strangers. Its called ""Last Night"" it was directed by Don McKellar in 1998 and you should add it to your queue if youve never seen it. Unfortunately this review is for ""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World"" which feels like the studio-notes version of ""Last Night."" While there are some amusing moments involving the films stellar cast of second bananas the ""quirky"" and utterly artificial love story at its center makes Armageddon feel like the preferable option. The script by first-time director Lorene Scafaria gives us a lead character who has allowed life to pass him by. This man is named ""Dodge"" which should give you some idea of the subtlety or lack thereof involved in this script. When scientists announce that the planets demise at the hand of an enormous meteor is unavoidable Dodge (Steve Carell) sits by helplessly as his wife goes running off into the night. Over the course of the next few weeks -- the last the Earth will enjoy -- Dodge gets to know his downstairs neighbor Penny (Keira Knightley) a bubbly free spirit who collects vinyl LPs and unworthy boyfriends. In true indie-movie fashion the two of them hit the road to take care of some unfinished business before the end of days. If ""Seeking a Friend"" presented these polar opposites as people finding respite in each others arms because they are literally the last people on Earth their unlikely romance would be easier to swallow. But no Scafaria wants us to believe that the love between this buttoned-up insurance salesman and this irritating gamine was always meant to be and that only Ragnarok could bring them together. The film often feels like a TV pilot that needs to recast its leads because its episodic vignettes involving other characters are the only parts that work. When Dodge and Penny encounter sexually liberated hedonists (played by Melanie Lynskey and Patton Oswalt) a philosophical trucker (William Petersen) a chain restaurant (T.J. Miller and Gillian Jacobs are among the waiters) where staff and patrons alike are hopped up on Ecstasy an ex (Derek Luke) of Pennys whos in full survivalist mode or Dodges estranged father (Martin Sheen) the movie briefly sputters to life only to fizzle once were back to the leads (and the adorable sympathy-milking stray dog they pick up along the way). Carells a talented comedian but based on this film and ""Dan in Real Life"" his idea of a dramatic performance is to be a lifeless lump. (Whereas his suicidal academic in ""Little Miss Sunshine"" while hardly a wacky-jokes piece of acting conveyed both sadness and an indication that someone was home.) As for Knightley whether its the sheer artificiality of the character as written or the banality of her performance shes never been worse. ""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World"" seeks to show that for most people time is only precious when theres a limited amount of it left. Its more successful at illustrating how 101 minutes can feel like a lifetime. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

His brand of schnook isnt the insecure intellectual that Woody Allen perfected or the average Joe with inner nobility patented by Tom Hanks. Carells signature character is an earnest dork with a good heart and bad luck. In his latest his misfortune is Armageddon itself. The doomsday comic romance ""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World"" has plenty of tonal problems -- given the concept how could it not? -- but Carells introspective dryly funny performance is a consistent delight. Carell plays Dodge a midlevel insurance exec whose wife bolts in an early scene unwilling to spend another day in his decent dull presence. With an asteroid just days away from pulverizing Earth writer/director Lorene Scafaria imagines that most people will simply carry on unable to digest the enormity of imminent extinction. Clients of Dodges insurance company call for clarifications about their coverage and his gamely upbeat boss asks the dwindling staff ""Who wants to be CFO?"" Theres some looting and amoral shenanigans of course. At a dinner party some of Dodges middle-class friends take a stab at Weimar Berlin decadence offering heroin and sexual encounters alongside the cocktails. In a wry deliberately repugnant cameo Patton Oswalt pulls upright Dodge aside informing him that as of now nothing is off limits. This glimpse into the abyss is quickly abandoned Scafaria having wandered uncomfortably out of her depth. Rather than the reckless exaggerated comedy that the end-of-days premise demands the film regresses to tried-and-tired rom-com chicanery. Dodge and neighbor Penny (Keira Knightley) meet cute and bond during a cross-country trip to reunite him with a lost love and her with her parents. The result is an exercise in shameless audience manipulation weakly imagined blandly sentimental and totally predictable. While Carells mix of humor resignation and psychological realism is effective Knightley is unconvincing as a gee-gosh-golly 2010s flower child. Penny is not a character but rather an assortment of behavioral tics and sitcom-simple character traits thrown into a box and shaken. From her bipolar wardrobe of Army surplus and thrift shop ruffles to her anachronistic passion for vinyl LPs shes a contrived oddball dream girl who exists only to give Dodge a second chance at youth. Martin Sheen Derek Luke and William Petersen feel equally forced and unconvincing in supporting roles. They play respectively a kindly pilot a survivalist romantic rival for Dodge and an enigmatic motorist but theyre really onscreen to prolong the rudderless story to feature length. The movie suffers from narrative aimlessness. Scafaria has done the almost impossible. She has made an apocalypse story dull. SEEKING A FRIEND FOR THE END OF THE WORLD  out of 4 stars Rating R for language including some sexual references some drug use and brief violence.

"Movie review Seeking a Friend for the End of the World crashes - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesReview Seeking a Friend for the End of the World crashesThe laborious film hits ever so slowly. Steve Carell and Keira Knightly star and Lorene Scafaria struggles in directing debut.June 21 2012|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Keira Knightley left and Steve Carell right star in ""Seeking... (Darren Michaels / Focus...)The drama and romance of ""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World"" starring Steve Carell and Keira Knightley starts imploding long before the massive asteroid hurtling toward Earth is due to deliver annihilation.At least its an ambitious misfire from the filmmaker screenwriter Lorene Scafaria making a rocky directing debut. The movie ponders what people would do with their final days if the end were a fait accompli. Will anarchy reign or will humanity win out? Will Dodge (Carell) and Penny (Knightley) relative strangers living in the same apartment building find each other and love before the planet and the asteroid collide? Or will they die alone? Lots of potential for a really tragic love story a from here to eternity literally.But by the time the answers come around so much has gone wrong a with the film as well as the world a its hard to care. Scafaria who made such a splash with her cheeky screenplay adaptation of ""Nick amp; Norahs Infinite Playlist"" in 2008 is simply over her head here.The troubles begin with the casting choices. What must have seemed like a perfect fit in Carell a those doleful eyes and a slight smile a is not even close. This already restrained actor is completely shut down as Dodge the resigned-to-his-fate man in the spotlight. For the versatile Knightley usually so at home in whatever shes handed a from ""Pride amp; Prejudice"" to ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" a the fit has perhaps never been worse. As Penny a funky artist type who collects vinyl records and dresses in thrift-store chic she is either nodding off (theres some sort of loose explanation of the medical condition early on) or flailing around and neither suits her.As the film opens Dodge is still suiting up for work every day selling insurance policies despite the airwaves being filled with the countdown to doomsday (with Mark Moses excellent as a reassuring anchorman). When Dodges wife leaves him he barely notices. He is so stoic its a wonder he has a pulse. An encounter with Penny a they ""bump"" into each other at the mailbox one of many ""collisions"" in the film a probably makes his heart rate spike a little but its hard to tell. They are certainly opposites. But these opposites attracting? Its a stretch.Before there is even a flicker of romance there is a very long road trip. It really serves as a walk down memory lane and a final chance for Penny and Dodge to mend fences right wrongs settle scores. Shes missing her family in England and he has a plan to get her there. Though the clock is ticking and these are theoretically desperate times they are never ever in a hurry. The films pacing is soooo slooooow that the coma-like sleeps that Penny falls into are easy to understand even easier to envy.The look of the film swings wildly between shots of a world gone out of control a riots looting suicides doomsday parties pity sex a to the surreally uneventful a lawn being mowed. Its as if director of photography Tim Orr (""Pineapple Express"") has been given two movies to shoot. Which might have worked if the dissonance had a point.Instead each time the film seems primed to make a statement about ""What It All Means"" it devolves into contrivances that are too predictable. Consider their stop at the home of Dodges high school sweetheart. The house is deserted but the electricity works and the pantry is stocked. So while Dodge looks around and contemplates ""what might have been"" Penny can whip up a gourmet meal. Once the meal is served only then do things go dark. But not to worry candles and matches are too conveniently right there.The most serious problem though is in the relationships especially the key one between Penny and Dodge. Moments that should be saturated with the churn of denial anger love passion tension fear acceptance or at least one of the above feel strangely void of emotion. If this is what the end of the world looks like dont bother to stay awake.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESReview In Anchorman 2 the classy-or-not gags continueDecember 17 2013Hope Springs review Tommy Lee Jones Meryl Streep keep...August 7 2012The Writer-director Upending the end of the worldApril 29 2012MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesBusinessFilmNot_live_webCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-seeking-a-friend-for-the-end-20120622,0,424858.story",200,seekingafriendfortheendoftheworld14,seekingafriendfortheendoftheworld,latimes

Its also tonally uncertain and occasionally foolish but somehow these flaws never derail the storys wistful pleasures not the least of which -- if we ignore an unpleasant speech by Patton Oswalt -- is its pleasing lack of the frat-boy vulgarity that has come to define so much of the genre. Even when wobbling dangerously between tragedy and comedy Lorene Scafarias screenplay (she also directed) resists the lifeline of cheap-and-cheesy Shed rather end a scene with a question mark than a dirty laugh. Brevity is the films mantra and driving force -- specifically if an asteroid were scheduled to pulverize your planet in exactly 21 days how would you spend your time? Its a fascinating question that Scafaria never fully explores mainly because shes not that kind of filmmaker. Hers is a microview Like her 2008 script for the charming Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist which unspooled over the course of one tune-filled night Seeking a Friend filters big themes through the lens of a single tentative relationship. On one side we have Dodge (Steve Carell at his most crestfallen) an insurance-company drone whose wife has fled to the arms of her secret lover. On the other floats Penny (Keira Knightley) a flappable pixie with a wrong-for-her boyfriend and a fanatical attachment to her vinyl record collection. Penny it seems bonds best with people -- and objects -- that require a lot of nurturing. Thrown together during a riot (riots and raves appear to be humanitys top two end-of-days choices) Dodge and Penny make a rather uneven deal She will help him locate his first love if he will help her reach her family in England. i Once Dodge and Penny hit the road the movie features a series of episodic encounters including one with Katie (Gillian Jacobs center left) and Darcy (T.J. Miller) at a T.G.I. Fridays-style eatery. Darren Michaels/Focus Features hide caption toggle caption Darren Michaels/Focus Features Once Dodge and Penny hit the road the movie features a series of episodic encounters including one with Katie (Gillian Jacobs center left) and Darcy (T.J. Miller) at a T.G.I. Fridays-style eatery. Darren Michaels/Focus Features As title cards and TV news mark the apocalyptic countdown the movie becomes a quirky travelogue peppered with offbeat episodic encounters. While some are more successful than others -- a stopover with Pennys survivalist ex-boyfriend subtly nails the way past loves prepare us for their successors -- together these segments create an emotionally off-kilter atmosphere that feels appropriately precarious. One hinges on such a shocking development that for a second laughter and horror are one and the same. Stumbling occasionally but never completely falling Seeking a Friend faces the fear of death not with images of widescreen digital destruction but with small moments that sidle up when we least expect them. In this the film is helped immensely by the casting of Carell an actor who carries an inner wound into every role. Dodge looks like a man who has lived with knowledge of the apocalypse all his life and Carell uses that terror to isolate his characters. Watching a scene where Dodge is expected to participate in a suburban orgy I couldnt imagine another performer of his generation so clearly embodying socially awkward alienation. Filled with poignant nudges toward human connection -- including the final sign off of an emotional news anchor -- this uneven disaster comedy has no need of the couples unconvincing declarations of love. Their friendship is miracle enough.

This is not necessarily a good thing. More about Seeking a Friend for the End of the World >> Bad news In 21 days an asteroid will hit Earth and - boom - bye-bye life. Worse Dodge (Steve Carell) a middle-aged middle manager is abandoned by his spouse Linda who beelines for her lover and - bam - bye-bye wife. Dodge will die alone. (Inside joke Linda is played by Carells real-life spouse Nancy.) Bad news Beset by anxiety his friends party shoot heroin indulge in orgies. Worse Dodge is too depressed to join in. Dodge will die alone and stone-cold sober to boot. Bad news Its the end of days. Worse Theres no savior in sight. Dodge will die alone without love or enlightenment. That is unless he keeps company with Penny (Keira Knightley) the alt-chick who lives downstairs listens exclusively to vinyl and conveniently has just kicked her live-in beau to the curb. For reasons of plot contrivance only Penny has a stack of letters to Dodge that she failed to deliver. They are from the love of his life expressing sorrow about their breakup. There are worse things than watching downbeat Carell and upbeat Knightley pluck offbeat chords of connection and tenderness. Still I expected that the screenwriter of the raffish romance Nick amp; Norahs Infinite Playlist would have come up with something less conventional than the one about the middle-aged burnout who gets recharged by the electric younger woman. Except for the very occasional threat of rioters and looters Scafarias view of the end times is strangely low-key and depopulated. Likewise placeless. Presumably Dodge and Penny are driving from New York to Delaware. When they stop in Camden to visit Pennys ex-ex (Derek Luke) a military guy whos built a bomb shelter you can see a dramatic mountain range in the background. Somewhere a Jerseyan is laughing. Scafaria herself a Jersey girl knows there are no mountains like that in the state. Befitting a Jersey native Scafaria does structure her film as a turnpike odyssey with rest stops. Its one inspired sequence takes place in a T.G.I. Fridays-type restaurant called ""Friendsys"" where the drugged-out and hormoned-up waitstaff is dancing till the world ends. (As Friendsys overfriendly host T.J. Miller is a hoot.) Yet while Dodge and Penny are pleasant enough company they dont strike sparks and consequently Scafarias movie never catches fire.

Director Lorene Scafaria (141) R Language drug use violence. Area theaters. Theres a moment in ""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World"" -- after weve seen people panic party or persist while waiting for an asteroid to hit the Earth -- when a quiet reverie turns this comic drama into one of the years most emotionally affecting movies. And that moment comes about simply In a leafy New Jersey suburb Dodge (Steve Carell) a middle-aged man surprised to be facing Armageddon alone is in the now-empty home where his high school sweetheart lived. With him is Penny (Keira Knightley) a neighbor from Dodges apartment house. Pennys found some old albums and over wine the two listen to lush Burt Bacharach-Herb Alpert 60s pop. As she dreamily says what she loves about records -- their weight their fullness of sound their variation in quality -- her tiny rhapsody becomes about us all. Writer-director Lorene Scafaria doesnt push the connection. But thanks to it this full-hearted rich movie earns the emotional symphony that concludes it. RELATED CARELL FINDS THE HUMOR IN END OF THE WORLD Facts about the beginning of the end come fast. Listening to a car radio Dodge and his wife hear that a last-ditch attempt by NASA to destroy the asteroid was unsuccessful; itll hit the planet in less than 21 days. His wife instantly opens the car and runs off. But Dodge is a creature of habit as are seemingly many people. He goes to work does shopping drives past suicides calmly despite the ticking doomsday clock. When he meets Penny she says she urgently wants to see her family in England though all flights are canceled. Dodge knows a guy with a private plane and since hes just received a letter from his former girlfriend its the perfect time for Dodge to help Penny while finding something that makes him happy. For the two or so weeks Earth has left. Yes it sounds bleak. But what Scafaria does that catastrophic dramas like ""Melancholia"" ""444 Last Day on Earth"" ""Perfect Sense"" and even the bombastic ""2012"" considered too far beneath them is appreciate the deadpan ""WTF?"" in the end of days. And through Carell who proves again hes an actor of depth and not just yucks the deep impact of the irony comes across perfectly. Carells chemistry with Knightley (doing her best work since ""Never Let Me Go"") is soulful something the film doesnt take for granted. Dodge and Pennys road trip brings them into contact with a variety of people including Pennys survivalist ex (Derek Luke) and a couple (Ron Corddry Connie Britton) whove opted to chuck civility. But ""Seeking a Friend"" takes strength from Dodge and Pennys recognition that theyre each others soulmate and Carell and Knightleys commitment to their unaffected performances. The film belatedly succumbs to obvious conceits but by then its safe inside a nearly perfect shelter. Magic Moment Dodge carries Penny to a waiting plane as the Hollies ""The Air That I Breathe"" plays.

Comments click to enlarge Seeking a Friend for the End of the World Recommended Video Rated R  101 minutes  2012 Lars von Triers Melancholia--only this time its a satirical romance and a good one at that. With three weeks to go before an asteroid destroys the earth Steve Carell gets ditched by his wife; he eventually bonds with downstairs neighbor Keira Knightley who leads him on an urgent road trip to reconnect with her family and his high school sweetheart. Lorene Scafaria making her feature debut as writer-director scores numerous laughs off the social dislocation that follows as people realize the apocalypse is imminent (theres a funny sequence at a suburban house party where no taboo goes unbroken). With no special effects and only a few modest riot scenes she manages to conjure a persuasively alien world mainly because shes worked out the emotional terrain. The choice supporting cast includes Connie Britton Rob Corddry Melanie Lynskey Patton Oswalt T.J. Miller and Martin Sheen. By J.R.

The apocalypse is upon us. Again.""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World"" is one of those tender Armageddon love stories that crop up every so often -- 1988s ""Miracle Mile"" 1998s ""Last Night"" 2009s French thriller ""Happy End."" This time theres an asteroid headed toward Earth scheduled to smack down in a week and in the global panic and resignation that ensue two lost souls find each other. If that sounds like Lars von Triers ""Melancholia"" on Prozac it is.Somewhat improbably the leads are played by Steve Carell and Keira Knightley -- a pair of actors who go together like burgers and tea. But the two give it their all (which in Knightleys case is occasionally too much) and before the script goes gooey on us in the back half the movie has a cracked sardonic take on how society might confront The End.Writer-director Lorene Scafaria imagines our final days as a party on a grandly neurotic scale with everyone trying to cram his or her bucket list into one short week. Heroin? Adultery? Pottery classes? Why not? The only person who hasnt found the spirit is Dodge (Carell) a sad sack insurance salesman whos very much an extension of the stars role in the recent ""Crazy Stupid Love."" As in that film his wife dumps him in the films opening scene bailing out of their car on a dark suburban road. ""I think we missed the exit"" Dodge says.These early sequences are tonally rickety but inspired exploring with light comic surrealism the human impulse to grab at experience before the lights go out. Dodges best friends are a pair of middle-class marrieds (Rob Corddry and Connie Britton) who feed their children martinis and start spouse-swapping with grim purpose. Air traffic grounds to a halt cellphones fail bodies fall from buildings. A magazine cover names Jesus Christ and Oprah as the ""Best of Humanity.""Dodge is roused from his torpor by a wistful letter from a college girlfriend and he sets out to find her. Hes joined on the road trip by Penny (Knightley) his young basket case of a neighbor. The actress digs in hard but her character is a collection of screenwriters tics from a super-hip vinyl collection (happy to see John Cale name-checked in a major motion picture though) to her ugly haircut to her ""hypersomnia."" That means Pennys impossible to wake up once she falls asleep a condition that seems to exist solely to justify a late-inning plot point.Penny wants to get to London to see her parents one last time Dodge knows a guy with a plane. There are interactions with a suicidal trucker (William Petersen) an easygoing survivalist (Derek Luke) and a small-town cop (Bob Stephenson) who wont tolerate misdemeanors just because the apocalypse is at hand. The scene with the most potential is the couples visit to a roadside restaurant where the staff is blissed-out on end-times fever and maybe a little Ecstasy; youve never heard anyone say ""Ill be your server today"" with such desperate enthusiasm.That sequence doesnt get where its going though and Scafaria seems unsure of where that even is. She wrote the script for the charming 2008 teens-in-Manhattan romance ""Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist"" and she has a terrific ear for dialogue thats cynical and hopeful at the same time. But shes not there as a director yet and ""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World"" struggles to find its voice.Eventually the film runs out of things to do and places to send the couple and after one last surprise cameo by a Respected Older Actor it settles into a rut of impassioned rueful romance. If only we could believe it. Carells performance is enjoyable but safe and while he and Knightley play well enough together theres no genuine chemistry -- no zap to convince us these two deserve to be the last lovers on Earth. ""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World"" tries to have it both ways but it may not be possible to send the planet out with both a bang and a whimper.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Its Melancholia-lite with elements of Breakfast at Tiffanys. And it works By Mary Pols MaryPolsJune 21 2012 Share Read Later Focus Features Seeking a Friend for the End of the World Year 2012 Director Lorene Scafaria Studio Focus Features Actors Steve Carell Keira Knightley Melanie Lynskey Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture Seeking a Friend for the End of the World is touching and often quite funny although its premise is bleak an asteroid is headed toward Earth and there is nothing anyone can do about it not even our hero decent but downtrodden insurance salesman Dodge (Steve Carell) or his spritely British neighbor Penny (Keira Knightley) who become roadtripping partners and friends in the last weeks of the world. In the aftermath of 9/11 some movie critics this one included wondered whether the American appetite for epic disaster movies might be diminished. Having seen in terrible close-up what a big-scale real-life tragedy on these shores looks like and been confronted with how hard it would have been to stop maybe filmmakers wouldnt be so inclined to make more movies where glib superstars such as Bruce Willis or Will Smith squash the terrorists divert the asteroid or take on the aliens. Instead the action disasters barely skipped a beat and irony never died. But a decade after 9/11 movies like writer/director Lorene Scafarias Seeking a Friend for the End of the World indicate a new comfort level with fatalism. Seeking is like the comic version of 2011s Melancholia--in which filmmaker Lars Von Trier let the world end in a stunning explosion of fire and the crescendo of his Wagner score. Its lighter and warmer but still containing that willingness to embrace the doom of the human race. A spate of recent films with sci-fi premises District 9 Monsters and Another Earth have also posed less than promising outcomes for earthlings. The cause probably has as much to do with the gloomy economic and environmental outlook as it does the long-term impact of seeing ourselves vulnerable and under attack but either way contemporary movies are exploring the end of the world as we know it. (READ Richard Corliss on Steve Carells transition to romantic comedies) Seeking begins three weeks before a 70-mile wide asteroid named Matilda is due to collide with Earth. As soon as Matildas arrival is a certainty Dodges wife (played by Carells real life wife Nancy) heads for the hills with nary a goodbye. The year is 2021 or near to it and astronauts have exhausted all the Armageddon-style possibilities of stopping the crisis. Cell phones have stopped working fuel is scarce and commercial air travel is about to cease presumably because of satellite interference. Scafaria making her directorial debut doesnt over-explain in her screenplay. All the bad news is delivered in the kind of flat tone that lets you know it is futile. Later in the story there are a few continuity problems and bits of logistical errors to niggle about but as a mood setter the matter-of-a-factness of the exposition is an effective tactic; the sadness is understood and the focus remains with the characters as they reckon with their lives. But as gloomy as all that would seem Scafaria paints a very witty (and plausible) picture of what the end of days might look like in America. Theres some beauty and comfort like a scene of people being blessed at a beach and a joyous trip to a chain restaurant but its basically as one character says very ""Wild West."" Drugs and sex abound regardless of class or age. ""Sarah and Dave brought heroin"" crows the hostess (Connie Britton) at a yuppie end-of-days party while her husband (Rob Corddry) pours stiff drinks for elementary school-aged kids. Another friend (Patton Oswalt) encourages Dodge to take advantage of the way the impending apocalypse has leveled the sexual playing field. But Dodge is too square and serious to do so. This is the quintessential Steve Carell role sad sack with dignity and not so different from his dumped husband in last summers Crazy Stupid Love but here he reveals both a more nuanced undercurrent of anger and more tenderness. (READ How Keira Knightley handled early expectations for her career) Seeking feels heavily influenced by of all things Breakfast at Tiffanys with Carell playing the George Peppard role to Knightleys Audrey Hepburn. Like Holly Golightly Penny is a party girl who loves music. (So does Scafaria; she also wrote Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist. She uses music very carefully in Seeking letting ambient sound work as the backdrop except when Penny is playing her precious records or say a car radio is on.) Penny crawls through Dodges window from the fire escape Holly-like on first introduction to avoid a boyfriend (Adam Brody) shes dumping. Holly puffed on a cigarette in a holder; Penny prefers a joint. Moreover the conversation between Dodge and Penny is from the get go necessarily of a darker nature than Paul and Hollys ever were ""I wont steal anything if you dont rape me"" she bargains with Dodge when she enters his apartment. Their roadtrip begins as a means of avoiding a riot and then evolves into a quest for both of them. Dodge wants to find his first love Olivia while Penny has hopes of getting someone with a private plane to fly her to England. They take along a stray dog and pay visits to friends and family along the way including Pennys insanely handsome kind of creepy ex-boyfriend (Derek Luke) a survivalist who plans on getting through the apocalypse. For both of them theres a blossoming sense of freedom albeit a rueful one (""I was totally going to peak at 40"" Penny says) and affection. Knightley has been steadily making movies but some of have gone straight to video on demand for good reason (London Boulevard Last Night) or perhaps been too challenging (the beautiful Never Let Me Go) so it feels as though shes been off the radar for a bit. Shes certainly been out of the corset (with the notable exception of the upcoming Anna Karenina). Perhaps adorable pixie chick isnt much of a stretch for her but shes captivating in Seeking and she and Carell develop an easy comic rhythm together. (READ Mary Pols on Crazy Stupid Love) Who would have imagined Carell and Knightley sharing a screen would make any sense at all? On paper they seem as mismatched as Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet in The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind--another existential comedy with bittersweet undertones. Ill admit that my level of emotional engagement wavered through the first two thirds of the movie as I tried to reconcile both this pairing and to manage my instinctual expectation that there would be a way around the asteroid. But when Seeking took hold of me completely and without warning I was digging for tissues. Its a lovely surprise for the official start of summer.

"Seeking a Friend for the End of the World (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Seeking a Friend for the End of the World (R) A promising comic riff on the apocalypse is sabotaged by sappy sentimentality and miscasting. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com6/21/2012 Editor rating 2 In the first scene of Seeking a Friend for the End of the World a space shuttle mission to keep a giant asteroid from plowing into our planet -- our last hope -- has failed. In 21 days Earth is a goner. Dodge (Steve Carell) is still processing the news when his wife (played by Nancy Carell in a cameo) literally runs out on him She bolts from their car and disappears into the darkness. When Armageddon is bearing down why waste another second doing things you dont want to do? And why not try things youve never done? Dodges friends a married couple (Connie Britton and Rob Corddry) with children throw a dinner party at their home where the kids are downing martinis and playing with fireworks while the grown-ups experiment with heroin and spouse-swapping. But Dodge is too shell-shocked to play along. He continues to show up to his drab job at an insurance agency where his boss announces ""Casual Fridays from now on"" and clients still call to inquire about an end-of-the-world policy. A friend (Patton Oswalt) tries to get Dodge to see the upside of the situation. Women dont care about getting pregnant or STDs anymore. ""Single guys like us we gotta grab this thing The apocalypse has leveled the playing field"" Seeking a Friend for the End of the World which marks the debut of writer-director Lorene Scafaria fares best as a farcical spin on Melancholia. In that movie the manic-depressive Kirsten Dunst went around admonishing everyone ""I told you life had no meaning"" But in this comedy the end of days is a force of liberation. Carell plays the movie completely straight letting everyone else bounce off his sad-sack persona. Nothing cheers him up not even the staff at a T.G.I.F.-like restaurant who have all dropped ecstasy and are ridiculous high and friendly and dancing around in conga lines. Then Keira Knightley enters the movie as Penny a young woman who loves vinyl records and realizes shes wasted her life on all the wrong people (including her whiny boyfriend amusingly played by Adam Brody). Dodge and Penny hit the road to escape the growing riots and mayhem of the big city. Many misadventures ensue. Love blooms and this previously dark comedy goes sappy on you. The two halves of the film are so different you wonder how they could have been written by the same person. Scafaria obviously has a wicked wit and a sharp sense of humor Why would she sabotage her own picture this way? You dont buy Carell and Knightley together for a second -- even if the world were about to end these two would not hook up -- but the movie still forces them on us. The story marches aggressively into formula and tear-jerking schmaltz and even things that once seemed graceful and right such as the scruffy little dog that Carell is forced to adopt become cloying. As Seeking a Friend for the End of the World crawls toward its sentimental finale youre rooting for that asteroid to get here quick.

"Review Seeking a Friend for the End of the World - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Apocalypse pretty soon romantic yearnings now in Seeking a Friend for the End of the World ??June 21 2012|Michael Phillips | Movie criticSteve Carell and Keira Knightley find love on a serious apocalyptic deadline in ""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World.""So much of the drama we respond to from the heart depicts ordinary flawed women and men navigating serious adversity or breaking through a wall of grief. And they are improved; their lives their futures are more connected and whole than before.These stories are extremely difficult to write and act and direct and sell to a summer crowd more interested in something with either zebras or lasers. For one thing theres a vaguely icky pitfall When things arent quite right with the tone or the scale of the story you end up with ""Extremely Loud amp; Incredibly Close"" which inadvertently processed the events of Sept. 11 2001 as a coy self-improvement exercise for a preteen survivor.""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World""written and directed by first-time feature filmmaker Lorene Scafaria struggles with similar implications in a tale set in our planets final weeks (an asteroids about to hit). If the characters played gamely and well by Steve Carell and Keira Knightley find each other in such a scenario surely thats a reasonable trade-off. True love. Total extinction. Right?Scafarias intention I think was different to pose to the audience the simplest of all questions. What would you do in such a dire situation with 21 days left on the clock? Set sort of in the present but a little bit in the future ""Seeking a Friend"" finds insurance salesman Dodge (Carell) going through his paces even after the asteroids imminent arrival has been confirmed. He works the phones in his increasingly desolate office building offering the ""Armageddon package"" to policyholders. His wife played in a brief bit by Carells real-life spouse Nancy Carell takes the end-of-the-world opportunity to leave Dodge cold.In the final weeks the world goes crazy. Some kill themselves or turn their social lives into a desperate last-chance orgy. (Rob Corddry and Connie Britton play Dodges best friends ready to par-tay.) Dodge at first settles in his numbed state for sliding into oblivion right along with Earth. Then he finds a note from his high school sweetheart the one who got away and sets into motion a plan to find her again. Dodge also meets neighbor Penny (Knightley) homesick for her parents back in England and stuck in a flat-lining relationship. Time for a change.Thus begins the road trip for Dodge and Penny. The highlight for us at least is a stop at a T.G.I. Fridays-like chain restaurant called Friendsys where the hugs never stop and Scafarias sense of humor flowers into a satisfying set piece. Scafaria wrote the script for the droll romantic odyssey (nonapocalyptic division) ""Nick amp; Norahs Infinite Playlist"" and shes clever; she knows how to spin variations on a theme of longing. Her debut directorial assignment has all sorts of polish and assurance.What it doesnt have is a way of making sense of its comic and dramatic strains together in the same movie. Carell and Knightley work hard to bring life and truth to each stage of a dawning friendship. By the end though Dodge and Penny have had one too many affirming encounters that feel engineered not lived.mjphillipstribune.comSeeking a Friend for the End of the World -- 2 starsMPAA rating R (for language including sexual references some drug use and brief violence)Running time 141Opens Friday MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesPennies help grieving mom surviveJanuary 21 2002Whatever He Says If He Acts Married Play DetectiveApril 5 1992Close To HomeMay 27 1996Find More Stories AboutKeira KnightleyTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0619-seeking-friend-end-of-world-20120621,0,1460950.column",200,seekingafriendfortheendoftheworld23,seekingafriendfortheendoftheworld,chicagotribune

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Within the last year two films--Lars Von Triers Melancholia and Abel Ferraras 444 Last Day On Earth--speculated about the looming apocalypse but from the fixed perspective of two or three characters with limited access to the outside world. It was a smart approach because it kept the filmmakers from having to speculate too much on the chaos beyond their borders because its hard to do so without seeming banal and reductive. Lorene Scafarias oddly winning romantic comedy Seeking A Friend For The End Of The World is often banal and reductive and tonally schizophrenic in gauging the last three weeks before an asteroid plows into Earth. And yet tonal schizophrenia seems about right for human beings who react all sorts of ways to The End from suicidal despair to plane-going-down orgies to small gestures of friendship and love that salvage some last comfort or meaning for the days before extinction. After getting the news that humanitys last hope for Armageddon-style salvation has ended in failure Steve Carells wife literally runs off leaving him to spend his last 21 days in a state of depression and denial. He tries to return to work as an insurance agent but that seems pointless as does a bacchanal thrown by friends that feels like a more urgent yet equally pathetic version of the key party in The Ice Storm. His life gains some purpose when he takes in two strays an abandoned dog and a quirky neighbor played by Keira Knightley who has just broken up with her musician boyfriend (Adam Brody). As rioters amass outside their apartment Carell and Knightley flee together en route to separate destinations--Carell to find the one who got away and Knightley to catch a small plane back home to England. Knightley is pure Manic Pixie Dream Girl fantasy a vinyl-toting sparkplug who serves mostly to shake Carell from his dead-eyed stupor but the relationship between the two becomes more touching as their wayward journey goes on. Scafaria hasnt imagined the apocalypse with the fullness of imagination it requires much less the weight perhaps because like all romantic comedies Seeking A Friend is supposed to go down easy. But theres real wisdom and honesty to the way this improvised friendship plays out as both characters struggle to leave this mortal coil with some perspective and dignity. Their response is trite but at least its something.

The trick is there is no future. And Seeking a Friend for the End of the World ponders human behavior in the face of impending oblivion with an idiosyncratic explosion-free bittersweetness I havent seen since -- well since Don McKellars excellent bittersweet 1999 end-of-the-world reverie Last Night. Written and directed with blithe chutzpah and good instincts by Lorene Scafaria (Nick amp; Norahs Infinite Playlist) the movie opens with the news delivered in calm TV-anchorman tones that an asteroid hurtling toward Earth will destroy the planet in three weeks. After that all genre-convention bets are off. Scafaria circumvents expectations at every turn beginning with the pairing of Steve Carell and Keira Knightley as downer Dodge and punchy Penny. The unlikely him-and-her buddy combo is odd to the point of fascination Thrown together on a time-sensitive road trip to find the high school love of Dodges life the two appear sometimes to be driving through Jim Jarmusch territory other times along Tree of Life highways.

Seeking a Friend for the End of the World Good Director Lorene Scafaria. Cast Steve Carell Keira Knightley RobCorddry. Rating R for language including several sexual references some drug use and brief violence. Theres comfort in watching him. Hes easy to root for. Handsome in an offbeat regular-guy way he plays characters who are essentially decent -- even when theyre annoying rubes like Michael Scott in the American version of ""The Office."" Hes back at it again in ""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World"" writer and director Lorene Scafarias funny affecting film about ... well the title is no joke. The film begins with a radio report breaking into music to say that the last chance we had of deflecting a massive asteroid hurtling toward Earth has failed; the world will end in 21 days. And now back to classic hits. ... It is a kind gentle ending of the world for the most part. Some people kill themselves and eventually others get around to rioting. But Scafaria gives her characters and the situation an absurdist tone that makes the whole concept a little more palatable. Everyone reacts differently. Dodge (Carell) hears the radio report with his wife -- who promptly runs away literally. He still reports to his job as an insurance salesman every day but his hearts not in it or anything else. How could it be? Its interesting to see the different reactions people have. Some jump out windows. Others like Dodges friend Warren (Rob Corddry) embrace a more carpe diem approach; in one scene hes helping a kid chug a martini. You wonder how you would react. Warrens wife Diane (Connie Britton) has her own way of coping which Dodge rejects. Dodges maid will be coming next Wednesday even if there isnt one. Mostly Dodge drinks cough syrup and mopes at least at first. And then one day he notices Penny (Keira Knightley) weeping on his fire escape. Her family is in England and flights have been suspended ... forever. She wont be able to see them again and regrets the time she has wasted with the wrong guys among other distractions. (Adam Brody is funny as the latest of them.) She has also accumulated without meaning to a collection of Dodges mail that the postman put in her box by mistake. She gives him a stack of letters and one turns out to be from a woman named Olivia -- the one who got away years ago. With the world ending Olivia decided to get back in touch -- and signed her letter ""You were the love of my life."" After his initial astonishment fades Dodge and Penny decide to go on what they both recognize is probably a quixotic journey -- a road trip to find Olivia and to find a guy Dodge knows who used to have a plane; if he still has it perhaps he would be willing to fly Penny to England to visit her family. (There is no longer cellphone or landline service so they cant just call.) It is probably no surprise that they will bond along the way as they face obstacles and share adventures. What is so surprising is how affecting it all is. The entire world is off the grid; an accidental visit to a chain restaurant goes from funny to weird to ... well you can discover it for yourself. But here as elsewhere Scafaria continues her theme If you knew you had only a few days left -- if everyone had only a few days left -- how would you spend them? The tone shifts substantially as the film goes on with fewer laughs as the odd couple get closer to their destinations. Some of it is a bit melodramatic but thats fine -- Carell and Knightley as their chemistry begins to blend by this point have earned it. One scene in particular is rather shameless in its grab for your heartstrings. But you know what? It got mine. And how. Some people might feel manipulated. I did not. I liked ""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World"" the notes it hit the questions it asked. And if Scafaria is guilty of playing on emotions at least shes good at it.

Dont worry about floods earthquakes or burning to death in an apocalyptic fire. When the end comes protect yourself with love. This is the message conveyed in Seeking a Friend for the End of the World writer-director Lorene Scafarias feature film debut. Its an intriguing take on the apocalypse as a pragmatic tone poem with comedian Steve Carell in his first deeply dramatic role (at least the first one Ive seen). He is very touching and unexpectedly appealing and with co-star Keira Knightley he exhibits a romantic chemistry of which I never thought him capable. An asteroid named Matilda 70-miles wide is hurling toward planet Earth and is expected to collide in 21 days. Cell phones are useless. Water and power are cut off. People trying to escape the cities are trapped in endless gridlock. Life has lost all meaning and the final flights on commercial airlines have just left the ground signalling the demise of air travel forever. Mr. Carell plays Dodge an insurance salesman who watches the unfolding tragedy on the network news with a mixture of horror and resignation while his wife simply leaps from the car and leaves him on the spot. Hes introverted and already bruised by life. Now he faces death alone. ""This is the Titanic"" says his best friend ""and theres not a life boat in sight."" Enter Penny a flaky downstairs neighbor in his apartment building hes always carefully avoided--neurotic extroverted resistant to reality. Secretly shes been withholding Dodges mail and now she delivers a letter from his long-lost high-school sweetheart. Distraught and clueless as to where to turn next the two strangers who have met accidentally join forces and hit the highway to find his old lover in New Jersey then travel on to locate Pennys family in Maryland. The movie chronicles their road trip and introduces the characters they meet along the way--a man they hitch a ride with who speeds up his suicide with the help of a hired assassin the partygoers in a roadside diner where the staff serves an orgy to desperate oversexed customers a highway cop determined to uphold the law right up to the final blackout by writing up a speeding ticket. Penny locates an old boyfriend living in a fallout shelter with enough potato chips to last another six months. Dodge gets as far as a reunion with the estranged father he hasnt seen in years (Martin Sheen). The movie shows how perspectives change--or remain the same--in the face of ultimate tragedy. There is room for tears mixed with unexpected humor. As the final blackout approaches and the TV stations leave the airwaves with one final test pattern the announcer reminds everyone watching to set their clocks ahead for Daylight Savings Time. This is an unusual film resistant to the usual end-of-mankind cliches. The script is full of surprises even when the parts dont always come together with the desired impact. The pace sometimes drags and the focus wavers. Yet the film asks a lot of valid disturbing questions to which Lorene Scafarias screenplay provides no easy answers. What would you do? Take up smoking again? Drink all the vodka in the liquor cabinet? Eat every fattening food the nutrition Nazis warn about? Have sex with anyone you want because ""nobody is anybodys anything anymore?"" In the overlapping hours of their search Dodge and Penny find a new definition of love that is irresistibly moving. If nothing else see it for the two central performances. Keira Knightley finds a role without a trace of her usual glamour while Steve Carell finally stretches his talents with more depth and quiet thoughtfulness than hes ever been invited to previously display. After so many hellish apocalypse movies Seeking a Friend for the End of the World is intelligent dignified and emotionally satisfying. The message is simple. If the end is inevitable then its better to face it with your arms around someone you love than alone and forlorn in an empty bed. The choices you make can lead to something oddly akin to optimism. rreedobserver.com SEEKING A FRIEND FOR THE END OF THE WORLD Running Time 101 minutes Written and Directed by Lorene Scafaria Starring Steve Carell Keira Knightley and Melanie Lynskey 3/4 Comment Filed under apocalypse Final Goodbyes friendship Keira Knightley Last Words love movie Movie Review Steve Carell Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics Pussy Riot On Their Provocative Donald Trump-Inspired Art Installation Culture Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture No Alarms No Surprises Why Buying Concert Tickets Is a Rigged System Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP",http://observer.com/2012/06/rex-reed-seeking-a-friend-for-the-end-of-the-world-keira-knightley-steve-carell/,200,seekingafriendfortheendoftheworld32,seekingafriendfortheendoftheworld,com/2012/06/rex-reed-seeking-a-friend-for-the-end-of-the-world-keira-knightley-steve-carell/

Look at the guy. This is his gift a fragile quality of unpersuasive manhood that carried him brilliantly through The 40 Year Old Virgin and The Office. But in Carells latest (a mostly somber end-of-the-world drama) were asked to accept him in a Von Trier-like asteroid-imminent scenario that just feels off. His character Dodge is not a sad-eyed comedy everyhero but a doomed loner partially reaching out to his flighty upstairs neighbor Penny (Keira Knightley) the two of them trekking on an ominous road trip to reconnect with Dodges ex-girlfriend as the world approaches its tombstone. The casting is spectacularly wrong and even on its own scant merits writer-director Lorene Scafarias screenplay has little insight into apocalyptic licentiousness barring a tart line or two. (""Nobodys anybodys anything anymore"" says a friends flirtatious wife but the scene hangs in tonal limbo.) Do we applaud the risk? Not when our takeaway includes such carpe diem banalities as Listen to those old vinyl records and savor them. Or Go hang out on the beach with a bunch of serene strangers in robes. The movie is way too gauzy to contain a serious comment; nowhere is this felt more than at the moment when mighty Martin Sheen shows up as Dodges deadbeat dad stumbling in a conversation with Carells stammering manchild. Who is going to mourn these trite types? Sometimes asteroids have the right idea.

"Seeking a Friend for the End of the World | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; seeking-a-friend-for-the-end-of-the-world ) Seeking a Friend for the End of the World (United States 2012) June 19 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli Someone could write a compelling thesis about humanitys obsession with the apocalypse. Over the years the cinema has exploited this affinity most often in disaster movies. Lately however there has been a trend toward end-of-the-world films that focus more on the human element than the global one. Lars von Triers Melancholia for example cared little about the science of an extinction event (to the point where his utter lack of any kind of realistic touchstone became a distraction) and instead explored how a small group of individuals would react to their imminent demise. For her directorial debut writer Lorene Scafaria has taken a parallel route but with less self-conscious artiness. Seeking a Friend for the End of the World is not mainstream fare but neither is it as willfully obtuse as Melancholia. Both movies however reject sensationalism in an effort to ground their stories. In fact it would seem that the effects budget for the von Trier film was higher than the one for Seeking a Friend. (Or at least thats how it looks.) Seeking a Friend is a sometimes frustrating mix of wonderfully effective moments and scenes that simply dont work. Ultimately what makes the movie worth seeing is not the awkward failed attempts at comedy but the deep reservoir of emotionally wrenching material plumbed (sometimes unintentionally) by the screenplay. Seeking a Friend reminds us that the end of the world represents a conclusion to all stories a brutal recognition that no hopes or dreams will be fulfilled. The two-year old child will not grow up have friends graduate from high school and get married. The pregnant woman will never give birth. Estranged friends and family members will never be reunited. Seeking a Friend doesnt dwell on these issues but it acknowledges them much as it provides a wide sampling of how people face Armageddon sex drugs solitude suicide rioting sticking doggedly to a routine or just trying to find someone to connect with before its all over. Steven Stills would understand love the one youre with. Seeking a Friend is being marketed as a comedy which is a mistake. Just because Steve Carell is the lead does not mean this is a laugh-riot. Some attempts at humor succeed but many fall flat (the annoying boyfriend being an example of the latter). For the most part drama and emotional honesty give this movie life. Its a road picture with a significant romantic component and it doesnt punk out at the finish line (although it loses some steam getting there). Anyone expecting Carell to be in full Anchorman/40-Year-Old Virgin mode will be disappointed. The ad campaign and trailers want Seeking a Friend to be something it isnt. The movie opens with a none-too-subtle swipe at Armageddon as a radio broadcast announces the explosion of a space shuttle that was Earths last hope to deflect the asteroid Matilda from a collision with the planet. There are three weeks left before the 70-mile diameter space rock makes most life extinct. A somewhat stunned Dodge (Steve Carell) carries on for a few days before recognizing that his last weeks should be spent differently than showing up for work at an insurance company. Eventually he decides to seek out ""the one who got away"" - his high school sweetheart Olivia. Meanwhile his downstairs neighbor Penny (Keira Knightley) is going through her own last days crisis. Her family is in the U.K. but since all commercial air travel has shut down she has no way of getting home to be with them for the end. Dodge claims to know someone with a plane and offers her a deal if she helps him locate Olivia hell get her home. Unsurprisingly along the way they meet a number of unusual characters and fall in love. Seeking a Friend plays to the strengths of both leads allowing Carell to be the controlled introvert and Knightley to portray the bubbly extrovert. Knightleys shining moment occurs during a telephone call; Carells best scene is one in which he makes a silent sacrifice. The chemistry between the two is understated but palpable (much like the sex scene). Viewed as a romance Seeking a Friend works in large part because the leads are given ample opportunity to get to know one another. They share the screen enough to make us believe they are falling for one another. And most of the typical romantic comedy impediments are absent. As with most road movies familiar faces appear in brief vignettes. The two most memorable are Martin Sheen as Frank a man who can achieve redemption by making a deal and William Petersen as a man suffering terminal cancer who takes out a contract on his own life. Why go that way? Because no one should know the day theyre going to die. Theres logic in that argument. Derek Luke Patton Oswalt Rob Corddry Connie Britton and Melanie Lynskey also have small roles. The end of the world will never be far from any viewers mind. Lest we forget there are frequent shots of a TV news anchor giving the latest updates. Certain elements lack verisimilitude (California for example is a horrible stand-in for the East Coast) but the movie does a good enough job with the background elements to not destroy the suspension of disbelief. There are some narrative hiccups during the final fifteen minutes but the movie ends as it must and theres an earnestness to this ""happily ever after"" that is often absent from road trips and romances. In this case we dont have to worry about this mismatched love affair falling apart after the end credits roll. The thing I respect the most about Seeking a Friend is that it got me to think about how I would react in these circumstances. I believed in the characters and although their actions didnt always ring true theres an emotional honesty to the way director Scafaria addresses them. Her attempts at humor fail more often than they work - this isnt an especially funny movie - but there arent many of them. Seeking a Friend wants to say something about the human need to connect and it does so in a convincing and satisfying way. This is a flawed motion picture but it has stuck with me longer than I expected. Its as life-affirming as an extinction event film can be.

The end of the world cant come fast enough in ""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World"" a disastrously dull take on the disaster-movie formula that chooses to spend the last three weeks of life on earth with two of its least interesting inhabitants. Dodge (Steve Carell) wears fuddy-duddy sweaters and sells insurance; Penny (Keira Knightley) likes old records and pot. The story of what happens to this pair in the face of certain extinction is only modestly more compelling than what happens to their houseplants. By releasing it amid blockbusters Focus merely amplifies the understated pics shortcomings. If the films of Roland Emmerich and Michael Bay have taught us anything its that Armageddon is only as interesting as the lives it threatens. Subtract spectacle from the equation and character becomes even more essential. By the time writer-director Lorene Scafaria got around to casting him Carell had played endearingly boring one too many times leaving a vacuum where Dodges personality should be. Penny feels equally underwritten which leaves the awkward sight of Knightley evidently still stuck in ""A Dangerous Method"" mode straining to appear girl-next-door cute while her facial expressions scream ""mental patient."" One might expect a livelier pair from Scafaria who previously adapted ""Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist"" and counts herself among Hollywoods recent wave of dirty-girl scribes including Diablo Cody and Dana Fox known for writing pull-no-punches relationship pics from a fresh female perspective. Certainly ""Seeking a Friend"" distinguishes itself from most male-directed end-of-the-world outings having more in common with Don McKellars talk-ourselves-into-oblivion indie ""Last Night"" than the typical testosterone-driven doomsday epic. Eschewing the showy visual-effects treatment the film only hints at the approaching asteroid occasionally cutting to a solemn old-school anchorman (""Mad Mens"" Mark Moses) to remind auds that mankinds fate is not in dispute. The end is definitely nigh; the question is what people will do with their remaining time. Some take to the streets and riot. Others hunker down in fall-out shelters. Dodges closest friends see the end as an excuse to cut loose trying heroin and consequence-free sex. For the Eeyore-like Dodge however the prospect of a looming deadline to get his life in order sends him into retreat. Hes the sort of guy who has never known what he wanted which is part of the problem; its hard to root for someone who doesnt even root for himself. Even Dodges wife (played by Carells real-life spouse Nancy) cant bear to spend the end with him clearing the way for a meet-cute with Penny the pretty neighbor Dodge discovers crying on his fire escape. ""I cant spend the last month getting to know someone"" Dodge sighs wearily and its easy to sympathize. Going to the movies is a lot like serial first-dating constantly getting to know new characters in the hope of finding some worthy of a repeat viewing maybe even a sequel. And then there are cases like ""Seeking a Friend"" where the chemistry isnt right and you just want it to be over. That first night Penny falls into a coma-like slumber on Dodges couch and the expression on his face makes it clear he just wants to be rid of her. Scafarias job over the next two weeks/90 minutes is to bring Dodge (and audiences) around to craving her presence. The film complicates this by introducing a romantic rival in the form of Dodges high-school g.f. Olivia. Enlisting Penny Dodge sets out on a road trip to reunite with Olivia whose offscreen presence symbolizes more than either of the onscreen leads can compete with. Even with this new mission on the books things move a little too slowly as the pic attempts to give the pair the time they need to fall in love with Dodge making small talk or Penny waxing philosophical about her record collection. Whereas some first-time helmers overreach by trying too many fancy techniques Scafaria errs in the opposite direction uncertain how to breathe life into a story that announces its expiration date at the outset. Whether a factor of limited budget or limited vision Dodge and Pennys world is curiously bereft of extras which gives the film an unintended post-apocalyptic feel. Where are all the people? Then again every time a side character turns up (opportunities for scene-stealing cameos by comics such as Rob Corddry Patton Oswalt T.J. Miller and Amy Schumer) it suggests the many friends who might have made the end more bearable.

Film Fest Review Seeking a Friend for the End of the World Struggles to Make Its Apocalyptic Romance Into a Touching Affair L.A. Film Fest Review Seeking a Friend for the End of the World Struggles to Make Its Apocalyptic Romance Into a Touching Affair Eric Kohn Jun 19 2012 100 am erickohn Share This Article Pin It Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Print Talk ""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World"" valiantly tries to inject a familiar premise with renewed emotional discernment and instead flails about in search of it. The directorial debut of screenwriter Lorene Scafaria (""Nick amp; Norahs Infinite Playlist"") ""Seeking a Friend"" follows a pair of would-be lovers on a meandering road trip that takes place in the weeks leading up to the destruction of the Earth a tried-and-true set-up that provides a simple backdrop for exploring lost souls in search of meaning in their final days. While smartly observant in individual moments however Scafarias thinly conceived story fails to deepen its scenario beyond the basic allegorical possibilities of the oncoming apocalypse. Cast in the same disaffected everyman role he embodies to a fault every time out Steve Carrell plays somber insurance salesman Dodge whose wife promptly abandons him upon news of Earths imminent demise. With 21 days to go before the cataclysmic event ""Seeking a Friend"" launches Dodges titular mission through a series of title cards that lead up to the final moments. That recurring device creates the perception of a gradual build to an expected revelatory payoff but the movie never rises to the challenge. In the process of relying alternately on poetic restraint and gags the films emotional grounding slowly dissipates. Before ""Seeking a Friend"" stumbles however it pitches a tone between comedy and tragedy that holds unique appeal. The movies first act chronicles Dodges homegrown pity party as he disaffectedly roams about a hedonistic bash thrown by his more upbeat pal (Rob Corddry) before heading home to sulk. Once there two events instigate sudden change. First he encounters the teary-eyed Penny (Keira Knightley) a delicate British woman stuck in a bland relationship with her musician boyfriend (Adam Brody) whos wishing she could spend her final days with her family. Around the same time Dodge discovers a note from his high school sweetheart and brashly determines his life will be complete if he can reunite with her in his hometown. When a neighborhood riot forces their evacuation Penny and Dodge collectively ditch their homes and make a split-second deal Shell drive him to see his former love if hell help her make it back to England. So begins an episodic odyssey enacted through a series of uneven vignettes some more engaging than others generally depicted with an uncertain mixture of bittersweet yearning and gravitas. The misadventure begins when the pair encounters a man who has placed a hit on himself but nothing that follows goes so dark. Notwithstanding the perpetual tonal confusion it becomes increasingly clear that ""Seeking a Friend"" strives for offbeat notes more often than it hits them. Instead Scafaria demonstrates a penchant initially illustrated by her ""Nick amp; Norah"" script for small irreverent exchanges that should seem farcical and instead contain a sustained emotional impact. (Other than Wes Anderson few can truly pull off this combo but many have tried.) A brief visit to the bomb shelter maintained by Pennys ex-boyfriend seems positioned for a throwaway gag but instead eloquently displays Dodges continual lack of self-esteem. The movie could have used more scenes like this which -- as in ""Nick and Norah"" -- provide a stronger connective tissue than the narrative. But ""Nick and Norah"" uses a delicate love story as its backbone; ""Seeking a Friend"" only manages to cobble one together late in the game. Scafaria hints at plenty of potent material that never fully takes shape. Her single best creation is a T.G.I.Fridays parody called ""Friendsys"" filled with a pleasure-seeking waitstaff intent on enjoying every last moment with an absurd degree of exuberance. A ""Friendsys"" movie might work wonders but other sequences reek of half-formed ideas. The abrupt arrival of Martin Sheen as Dodges estranged father stands out more for its randomness than relevance to the plot. Carrell and Knightley invest in their archetypical characters as much as they can as do the handful of other bit players dropped into various scenes (Mark Moses as the devout anchorman seen on the TV throughout the movie lands one of the few genuinely moving scenes with his final exit). Ultimately though ""Seeking a Friend"" fails as both actors showcase and parable because it suffers from a lack of original ideas. The focus on behavioral minutiae in an apocalypse scenario has simply been done too frequently for Scafarias take to provide anything fresh. Its closing scenes call to mind countless End-Of tales with far superior vision from Abel Ferraras ""444 Last Day on Earth"" to Lars von Triers ""Melancholia"" and Don McKellars ""Last Night."" In each case the process of making peace with life when faced with imminent death is taken out of its imaginary scenario and imbued with extreme depth through the use of powerfully expressive close-ups. In ""Seeking a Friend"" however the movies potential for depth ends long before the world does. Criticwire grade B- HOW WILL IT PLAY? Focus Features releases ""Seeking a Friend"" in several cities on June 22. Its star cast and quirky premise may help it perform solidly in its opening weekend and for some weeks following but much of its potential for longterm success will depend on critical response which is destined to be mixed.

TWITTER Steve Carell and Keira Knightley explore the romantic upside of Armageddon in Lorene Scafarias comedy. The end of the word is nigh in this enjoyably offbeat rom-com from the first-time writer-director Lorene Scafaria. Very nigh indeed - in a few short weeks a gigantic asteroid will slam into Earth wiping out all of mankind. Which is especially bad news for Steve Carells newly single insurance salesman. Because the only thing worse than dying in an apocalyptic firestorm this film suggests is dying alone and unloved. Essentially Scafaria has re-imagined Lars Von Triers planet-smashing gloomfest Melancholia as a quirky road movie in the spirit of Alexander Paynes About Schmidt. Scafaria is best known for scripting the 2008 young-adult comedy Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist. Her directing debut is a superior effort its slightly uneven tone redeemed by the reliably sympathetic Carell in a typically deadpan suburban everyman role. With its sharp script and bittersweet humor the audacious premise feels fresh enough to earn a large word-of-mouth audience among moviegoers who normally would avoid a more conventional rom-com potentially becoming a left-field breakout hit in the mode of Juno or Little Miss Sunshine. VIDEO Steve Carells Seeking Friend Trailer Looking a little more gaunt and haunted than usual Carell plays Dodge a timid middle-rank office drone whose life clearly has been a series of quiet defeats and creeping disappointments. With the apocalypse looming fate deals Dodge an extra slap when his wife walks out on him to spend her final few weeks with her previously secret lover. The brief cameo appearance by Carells real offscreen wife Nancy is a neat in-joke here. Lonely and suicidal Dodge resists invitations from his friends to spend their final few weeks immersed in one long booze-addled swingers party. Instead his life takes a bizarre new turn after he is saddled with an abandoned dog and becomes a reluctant love-life confidant to his emotionally fragile young English neighbor Penny portrayed by Keira Knightley with just the right degree of irritating kookiness. A free spirit with an amusingly self-absorbed musician ex-boyfriend (Adam Brody) and a fetishistic love for the smell and sound of vintage vinyl Penny is a kind of fantasy girl-geek designed for maximum appeal to middle-aged male indie-rock fans. Scafaria clearly knows her target audience well. STORY 3 Female Filmmakers Stake Out Their Turf at LAFF 2012 Forced from their apartment block by a rioting mob die-hard romantic Penny persuades Dodge to take her on a cross-country road trip that potentially could reconnect her with her family and him with his long-lost childhood sweetheart Olivia. Commandeering a stolen truck whose owner has arranged his own macabre suicide by execution they cruise along spookily empty back roads and eerily depopulated suburban streets. Their journey becomes a succession of odd characters and eye-catching spectacles military-trained survivalists overzealous traffic cops a mass baptism in the ocean. Inevitably sexual tension develops between this odd couple of lost souls. Just as the real subject of Melancholia was not planet-crunching sci-fi spectacle but soul-crushing depression the true theme of Seeking a Friend is the finite nature of time and how foolishly we ignore it. Scafaria never once shows the approaching asteroid or the doomed Armageddon-style shuttle mission that fails to arrest it instead laying out her premise with admirable economy via TV and radio news reports. Her end-of-days plot is essentially an allegory for everyones limited lives the accelerated deadline adding an extra edge of futility to most human activity whether sweating at the gym or striving for promotion at work. Shooting her nonspecific Southern California locations in bright hues and constant sunshine Scafaria maintains a cheerfully ironic and unpredictable tone for the first half of the movie scoffing at vanity and self-delusion with sharply observed social observation. Like the suburban dinner party that degenerates into a desperate bucket-list orgy ""Put Radiohead on"" one guest demands ""I wanna do heroin to Radiohead"" Later in a stand-out comic set piece Dodge and Penny visit a TGI-style roadside diner apparently staffed by a cult of free-love stoners. Amplifying the happy-clappy weirdness normally found in such places by just a few degrees this is inspired satire. The cynical screenplay softens a little during its final act bowing to familiar Hollywood tear-jerking tropes -- a screen legend makes a late appearance as Dodges estranged father adding a superfluous twist of unresolved Daddy Issues. In fairness Dodges search for his lost childhood sweetheart resists cliche with an agreeably ambivalent offscreen farewell. But Scafarias take-home message that budding romance with a virtual stranger is the best comfort in the face of impending apocalypse feels a little too corny. After 100 minutes of gallows humor and surprise left turns Seeking a Friend leaves us with a disappointingly banal observation All you need is love. It is hard to imagine Payne or Von Trier letting such fortune-cookie whimsy sweeten lifes harsh lessons. But that said Scafaria and her two likable leads have made a witty warm-hearted and impressively original addition to the rom-com ranks.
