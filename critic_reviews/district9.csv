TriStar Pictures District 9 Director Neill BlomkampGenre Sci-FiRunning Time 113 minutes Rated R Bloody violence and pervasive languageWith Sharlto Copley Jason Cope Nathalie Boltt (Recommended) Watch Clips Aliens Arrive Sprayed Contraband Filmed almost entirely on a giant South African rubbish dump District 9 spins human trash into extraterrestrial gold. Charging through a three-day story arc with end-of-the-world intensity its characters dare us to quibble over their unpronounceable names and unintelligible accents. But then as their frequently-subtitled exchanges prove words arent really the point When its human against alien we rely on our eyes much more than our ears. Made for around 30 million -- a steal at todays prices -- this frenetic debut by Neill Blomkamp (a protege of Peter Jackson who produced the film) grabs you by the eyeballs from the very first frame. Jacksons own cinematic technique may have congealed into a bloated caricature of itself but District 9 proves he still recognizes talent. As we learn from a brilliantly concise intro involving faux newsreels and direct-to-camera interviews with government drones or corporate mouthpieces an alien spaceship stalled above Johannesburg 20 years earlier its million passengers helpless and starving. Labeled ""prawns"" due to their love of scavenging and their disgusting-to-humans physical appearance (a hybrid of the monster from Predator and Pirates of the Caribbeans squid-faced Davy Jones) the aliens were corralled into an area known as District 9. Now however the District has devolved into a stinking violent ghetto and the multinational entity in charge of it has decided to relocate the refuse-happy residents. Heading up the dangerous task of evictions is Wikus Van Der Merwe (Sharlto Copley) a dedicated bureaucrat considered expendable by his loathsome boss-cum-father-in-law. i Theyd phone home if they could ""We didnt mean to land here"" one alien explains.

David Bloomer/TriStar Pictures Wikus is a bit of a pill; officious and with a sneering superiority hes unafraid of the prawns and not above threatening the removal of their insectoid offspring should they refuse to relocate. The early scenes which follow Wikus and a harried TV news crew as they trudge from one hovel to another brandishing eviction notices have a nerve-jangling tension spiked with dark humor. i MNU In Black?

Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley) is employed by Multi-National United (MNU) a company tasked with researching the aliens weapon systems. David Bloomer/TriStar Pictures Seamlessly blending the natural and the unnatural Blomkamp layers visual gags (signs warning ""No Non-Human Loitering"") with aural (alien conversations that sound like extreme intestinal distress) while advancing a plot rife with references to E.T. The Fly and Alien Nation. References to apartheid are a given. The wonder is that despite its obvious roots District 9 feels staggeringly original. Channeling Cloverfields on-the-fly shooting style and Paul Verhoevens energy and anti-corporate sensibility (theres even a cameo by what looks like RoboCops ED-209) the movie rarely holds still. And while this restlessness has predictable consequences for character development -- only Wikus feels three-dimensional -- its difficult to care. As corporate bigwigs lust after alien technology and the aliens lust after cat food (can a Fancy Feast endorsement be far behind?) District 9 gradually narrows its focus and widens its ambitions. The final struggle between alien and human will be played out not on the ground but in Wikus bloodstream a war zone less visible but infinitely more consequential.

"Review District 9 a brash inventive debut - CNN.com Share this on Mixx Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon Review District 9 a brash inventive debutStory Highlights ""District 9"" is a winning debut says CNN.coms Tom Charity Film is about extraterrestrials who emerge over Johannesburg Eventually theyre to be moved to a camp and then the action starts Next Article in Entertainment >> By Tom Charity Special to CNN (CNN) -- Why do UFOs always land in the USA wondered someone in ""Monsters vs. Aliens""? Good question. Sharlto Copley plays a bureaucrat forced into action in ""District 9"" a film about extraterrestrials. But its not always the case as Neill Blomkamps adventurous sci-fi movie ""District 9"" goes to show. Presented in the now-familiar fake-doc style -- at least until Blomkamp gets bored with its limitations when the action heats up -- ""District 9"" is an edgy little B movie with an injection of impressive big-money special effects courtesy of ""Lord of the Rings"" director-producer Peter Jackson. The storys origins are with the extraterrestrials arrival in the early 80s when they park their spaceship a mile or so above Johannesburg South Africa. The ship is vast -- almost the size of the city -- but when after three months there has been no contact from the visitors no sign of life in any form the authorities decide to break in. What they find is a wretched cargo of pale starving creatures tall bipeds with scaly skin and stubby insect-like tentacles around the mouth. The humans call them ""prawns"" and after establishing that the worst threat they pose is a cosmic PR disaster they bring them down to earth and stick them in a refugee camp. That would be District 9 a shantytown of makeshift wooden shacks no electricity or running water and scarcely enough space for the million or so newcomers. After a couple of decades of uneasy coexistence even this set-up seems too cozy for the residents of Joburg. With civil strife and black-market gangsters getting out hand it is decided the prawns should be relocated to a new camp somewhere out of harms way. International law being what it is the South Africans are required to collect the signatures to indicate the prawns acquiescence. And thats where mild-mannered bureaucrat Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley) comes in -- with a delegation of trigger-happy private security guards. Dont Miss District 9 determined not to stick to formula ""District 9"" is a truly global affair. The South African-born Blomkamp learned his trade in Canada and found a mentor in New Zealand. But its the location that allows this allegory to resonate. Here in North America we may darkly imagine that interlopers not only mean us harm but that they have the wherewithal to back it up. In South Africa though the story takes on more complex queasy echoes. The British effectively invented concentration camps here at the turn of the 19th century and the Boers the victims then would mandate that native Africans were nothing but second-class citizens. Naturally the prawns come lower still down the pecking order. Blomkamp indulges in grisly blackly comic satire worthy of Paul ""Starship Troopers"" Verhoeven as our man Wikus (Sharito Copley) casually demonstrates the art of aborting alien offspring with the aid of a flamethrower all for the edification of the viewers back home. Complacent and overconfident in front of the cameras Wikus gets his comeuppance when he accidentally ingests an unidentified liquid substance which incurs an alarming physical reaction. At this point the movie changes tone sometimes for better sometimes not. ""District 9"" also begs plenty of questions; not much of it makes sense if you stop to think about it. And Blomkamp seriously overplays his hand in the long thoroughly conventional climactic shoot-em-up. What should have been a taut 90-minute nightmare flick -- a classic midnight movie -- has somehow pumped up into a 112-minute approximation of a Hollywood action blockbuster. Still ""District 9"" has plenty of material to chew on. Expanded from a six-minute short its a brashly confident debut full of sharp inventive detail (the prawns are crazy for cat food) and rooted in a couple of Big Ideas. Well worth the time if not all of it. ""District 9"" runs 112 minutes and is rated R. For Entertainment Weeklys review click here.

District 9 takes this ominous spectacle shrouded in an impressively realistic haze and the broadcasts of numerous helicopter crews and weds it to a grungy fable about humankinds ugliness to its guests. The sci-fi thriller sometimes plays like a political documentary other times like the gruesomely dark gems of the 1980s Jack Sholders The Hidden or Paul Verhoevens RoboCop. Behind it all is executive producer and hobbit master Peter Jackson who obviously cant say goodbye to his blood-spattered genre roots. (Thats a good thing.) The movies creatures rendered with insectoid precision and derisively called ""prawns"" by the white characters are ghettoized in a Soweto-like township. There we learn theyve languished on cat food for three decades. (Forgive the setup its smaller absurdisms.) When Wikus (Copley) an unctuous government stooge is tasked with forcibly relocating the aliens to another site the movie quickly attains a scary enervating tension from which it never quite modulates. Our unlikable main character is sprayed in the face with black goop and begins evolving turning him into a valuable bioweapon. Wikus becomes a fugitive the film alternating between Abu Ghraib--like torture scenes and libertarian John Carpenter heroics. District 9 has too many gory vaporizations to qualify as a serious statement on race relations but it does outclank Transformers Revenge of the Fallen by a wide margin and you thrill to the cleanly cut action sequences. A gang of cannibalistic Nigerians is unfortunate but Neill Blomkamp mounting his first feature is taking on more real-world drama than future schlock generally allows.

BOTTOM LINE The most inventive sci-fi film of the year so far. CAST Sharlto Copley Jason Cope Vanessa Haywood LENGTH 151 What the sci-fi action flick ""District 9"" lacks in famous faces it makes up for with sheer imagination. Its an unlikely summer blockbuster shot with a South African cast on a restrained budget. Its also a refreshing blast of original filmmaking. Instead of Shia LaBeouf or Nicolas Cage we get the unknown but excellent Sharlto Copley as Wikus an amiable bureaucrat whose private security firm has been hired to solve Johannesburgs immigration problem. No not the Zimbabweans but a population of gurgling crab-clawed extraterrestrials living in a segregated slum called District 9. advertisement | advertise on newsday Its an obvious allegory but director and co-writer Neill Blomkamp making his feature debut under the guidance of producer Peter Jackson (they worked on a scrapped adaptation of the video game ""Halo"") never overplays it. Shot partially as a documentary with talking-head journalists and relief workers the film cannily creates a new but familiar downtrodden minority. The aliens are even tarred with a slur prawns. In a door-busting raid Wikus and his privatized military merrily drag the creatures from their homes and torch their eggs. But after a canister of mysterious fluid explodes in his face Wikus attitude - and his body - will change. His new best friend a resourceful alien saddled with the Western name Christopher Johnson (Jason Cope). Plot holes and techno-nonsense abound but this smart funny fast-moving film will earn your patience. Like ""Planet of the Apes"" for a media-savvy generation ""District 9"" is a highly entertaining take on a serious subject.

By Anthony Lane Earthly survivors known by their numbers in an animated film by Shane Acker.   Credit Illustration by Edwin Fotheringham The heroes of ""9"" are a wild bunch and a squashy one to boot. The title character 9 himself is woven from a type of sacking with a funky zipper up the front as if his creator had spent too long in the front row at Vivienne Westwood shows. His grim-faced elder 1 comes in a light tweed. Others are closer to cotton or corduroy while 7 a fighting female is wrapped in a soft white leather or some such to match the bird skull that she dons for maximum effect. (Of 6 clad in stripes like a concentration-camp victim the less said the better; who approved this woeful lapse in taste?) All are the size of Teddy bears though none I feel would soothe your kids to sleep; not just because of the copper digits pointed and jointed that 9 appears to have borrowed from Freddy Krueger but because he and the other creatures--the name of whose race or brand we never learn--exist in a state of tireless uncomforting desperation. Its hard to be anything else I suppose at the end of the world. The landscape that our friends inhabit is fast becoming as familiar to doomy young filmgoers of today as Monument Valley was to devotees of Westerns. Bruised old skies ill winds dumps of rusted wreckage whole cities like broken jaws dotted here and there with sparks of hope welcome to Apocalypse Lite. It will scarcely be news to those versed in ""Wall-E"" and the interminable Terminators that our planet has yet again succumbed to the ravagings of machinery. ""Our blind pursuit of technology only sped us quicker to our doom"" we are told in an opening voice-over--nasty wicked technology you understand as opposed to the beneficent playful variety that allowed Shane Acker the director of ""9"" to wield the elaborate computer animations that account for every pixel on his screen. Its the old story humans build contraptions and contraptions become self-conscious which means spending hours in front of the mirror refusing to dance at parties and in a climactic tantrum cleansing all humans from the spotty face of the Earth. The story concerns the struggles of 9 and his pals--""all thats left of humanity"" allegedly although I never quite grasped how Homo sapiens evolved into minor items of haberdashery--to take arms against a sea of machinery and in the process to work out why the task should have fallen to them. The tone as a result is a blend of vengeful action picture punctuated by fireballs and more peaceable mystical--and frankly nonsensical--ruminations on the nature of destiny. I am still frowning at the finale during which the souls of the departed rise to Heaven mosey around for a while and rain back down as busy green droplets teeming with fresh life. As eco-salvation goes the end of ""Wall-E"" made far more sense even if James Thurber got there first with his fable entitled ""The Last Flower"" and the leading question posed by ""9"" is not ""What can I do to save the environment?"" but ""Who is running Heaven anyway?"" The Almighty has washed his hands of us and rightly so; you can tell as much from the ruined cathedral in whose bell tower 1 and his sidekicks take refuge like mini-Quasimodos. The only resident gods are people like Timur Bekmambetov the director of ""Wanted"" and Tim Burton both of them producers on this film who may be responsible for its dual aroma of the weirdly whimsical and the gothically intense. And heres the strangest thing of all it works. How it works exactly is hard to fathom. The script by Pamela Pettler is a lumberyard of capitalized entities the Machine the Beast the Talisman the Source. Not to be rude or anything but what is the Damn Point? ""I found him in the Emptiness"" 5 says of 9 at the start which is the kind of line you might have used when introducing a friend to Jean-Paul Sartre but not now and certainly not when the friend in question looks like Piglet. Some of the voices--notably the senior ones belonging to Martin Landau and Christopher Plummer--are grimly convincing but Elijah Woods 9 lacks the staunchness of his Frodo. As for the music its way too lusty and rambunctious for the setting although there is one exquisite sequence in which like Wall-E with his ""Hello Dolly"" video 9 and 7 listen to an ancient LP of ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" on a windup gramophone. Dimly through the dust we see an approaching monster believed dead but Judy Garland far from being interrupted keeps on singing like a bluebird until the horror is right in our faces. At such moments Acker comes into his own operating with tautness and delicacy; he seems engaged less by giant routine detonations than by the marvellous scene in a cavernous library staffed by a pair of twittering archivists with socks on their heads where 9 and his comrades soar up to the shelves on a swinging arm in a bid to track down the secret of their survival. Like the Machine screwing and soldering its latest apprentice into life or 9 constructing a lamp from detritus Acker somehow stitches together unlikely offcuts into a fully functioning world. You cant say he fleshes it out for there is no flesh available but his precision helps you take it on trust and the opening shot of a thread passing through a needles eye with 9 himself being patched and primped as Woody was by the doll doctor in ""Toy Story 2"" is a wholly fitting detail on which to embark. To subsist neither by preaching nor destroying but by following the modest proverb that tells us to make do and mend that seems like a manageable dictum for our times. Even sackcloth as 9 himself proves can rise from the ashes. Another nine another wasteland. ""District 9"" has been out for a while but audiences continue to gather lured by rumors of a hybrid--a writhing snapping chunk of science fiction that looks and smells like fact. We start in an office; indeed it could almost be ""The Office"" with a nervous nerd named Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley) all halfhearted beard and gulping grin giving an interview to the camera. If you were told that less than a couple of hours later the same fellow would be strapped into the cockpit of a striding cyberweapon pulverizing all who draw near like Jeff Bridges at the end of ""Iron Man"" youd laugh. But there are more laughs to come bitter rather than easy in Neill Blomkamps formidable feature debut steeped as it is in the ironies of prejudice. Aliens have landed. Not for a change on the East Coast of America but in Johannesburg which happens to be Blomkamps home town. The newcomers numbering millions are known as prawns a crude but forgivable jibe; imagine a shrimp cocktail with sprinters legs and the eyes of an extremely angry cat and youre there. Though likely to turn hostile if provoked theyre not out to destroy mankind; theyre just here and nobody--as we learn from the comments of police politicians and aid workers--knows what to do with them. And thus like so many of the unwanted before them they are fenced into a township and forced to scavenge. ""At least theyre keeping them separate from us"" a black woman says. Blomkamp has no need to tread heavily here. The movie is instinctively alive to the history of segregation in his native land--and to current tensions too like that caused by the vast influx from Mugabes despoiling of Zimbabwe. The plot quickens as Wikus who works in alien relations is told to oversee the mass deportation of the prawns to a new camp--a task that was made easier for the filmmakers when they found a shantytown built on landfill near Soweto from which real South Africans were about to be moved. No wonder the documentary images that are chopped and diced into the narrative (TV reports closed-circuit footage and vox pops) lend such natural flavor to the mix one consequence being that when the weedy Wikus gets sprayed with essence of prawn and finds himself sprouting a large claw where his hand used to be we dont shrug it off as an overcooked special effect but accept it as just the kind of hazard that would crop up in a culture as crazed and pressurized as this. ""District 9"" cost thirty million dollars or roughly a fifth of the marketing budget for ""Transformers Revenge of the Fallen."" The double blessing of this thrift is first the lived-in scruffiness of the background with prawns rooting through hillocks of trash or chomping on tins of cat food (their snack of choice) and second the low-rent high-energy presence of the actors--not stars for whom we would be programmed to root but ordinary sorts whose fortunes we cannot predict and for whom our sympathies continually shift and sway. Who would have thought that Wikus could go from bureaucrat to tramp and then to ""the most valuable human artifact on earth"" all in a single day? Or that he would wind up knocking politely at a prawns door? Or best of all that the prawn himself would be known as Christopher Johnson the idea being that regular names will make the aliens feel at home? (So much more welcoming than 9 or 7.) You dont feel bamboozled fooled or patronized by ""District 9"" as you did by most of the summer blockbusters. You feel winded and shaken and shamed.

Blame George Lucas blame the studio money men but sci-fi has become a largely escapist genre dime store romance for white males. Not that theres anything wrong with escapism as Neill Blomkamp demonstrates in the latter half of his debut feature District 9. But he sets up his political agenda first and the result pays dividends both as ideology and entertainment. The place is present-day Johannesburg a recognisably gritty crime-filled metropolis on the brink of permanent collapse. But in Blomkamps South Africa theres a new underclass a race of immigrant aliens known as prawns survivors of a dying planet searching for a new home. Our guide into this world is Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley) a self-satisfied middle manager for shady global corporation MNU whose task is to contain the prawns within their hastily constructed inner city slum District 9.It would have been easy for Blomkamp to play the film as a straight Apartheid metaphor a blunt but rather outdated critique of inequality. But District 9 has a more pressing and timely agenda its about the legacy of that hateful regime how its insidious influence has produced a country where the previously disenfranchised black citizenry are beginning to turn on an even more deprived social group immigrants. And so the film becomes a portrait of cyclical segregation with the prawns as a catch-all metaphor for displaced asylum seekers worldwide. But District 9 is no dry socio-political treatise. The opening scenes use newsflashes ad breaks and to-camera interviews to set up the complex backstory but these distancing techniques fall away as our focus narrows on Wikus who is beginning to experience grotesque bodily transformations after accidentally ingesting a mysterious alien fluid. The climactic sequences - as MNUs hunt for the renegade Wikus causes widespread and violent disruption - eschew subtext entirely in favour of nailbiting brain-splattering action but its unlikely many viewers will begrudge Blomkamps decision to cut loose. With the films finale - and Stateside success - leaving the stage set for a potential District 10 perhaps were witnessing a new dawn for politically engaged sci-fi and horror with Blomkamp as a latter-day George Romero. Either way this is a stunningly impressive debut.

That is where I think U.S cinema often lacks imagination and ends up producing a very ""samey"" product that fails to say anything original and also at 30 million it wasnt that cheap to produce. When my daughter read my review she pointed out that the hero wasnt a policeman but a company man and she said that I had not concentrated properly while watching the film. I did like some aspects of it especially the whole evil arms industry portrayal so perhaps I should give it a second chance viewing although I still think they should have hidden that precious liquid in a better placeFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplySep 21 2009critiqueFeaturedReasonably imaginative but flawed and ultimately under-developed.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplySep 21 2009NettaFeaturedSee if Jaffrey could do betterit is when all is said and done a low budget film I love American films with all that goes with thembut this was interestingly different.Yes there were plenty of questionsbut Id like to watch more of this guys work.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplySep 21 2009rafe JaffreyFeaturedDistrict has an interesting premise but ultimately the film is a failure because it does not explore or develop its own themes well enough but relies too much on the special effects which although very good are no substitute for a real story line. Some of its glaring faults are The film moves in and out of the documentary format in a way that is confusing. There are no racial tensions between different human groups only between aliens and humans. Although the aliens seem technologically advanced they are socially completely backward and unable to organise themselves in any way. On the other hand they are not addicted to alcohol or drugs which would have been good to include as part of"" the aliens are really deprived migrants"" theme. The film is also very sloppy on detail. Why for example is it beyond the wit of the humans to find the missing spacecraft using ground sonar when it is only a few metres below ground? Equally why dont the aliens hide the craft in a better way and why are there no alien power struggles centred around this craft? Out of nearly two million aliens the attempt to get the hell off Earth revolves around two adults and one child this is very silly It takes the aliens twenty years to collect enough special liquid to power the small craft but instead of hiding it somewhere in that craft (which is hidden) they leave it in a drawer in a shack above in District 9 which they know is being raided Come on talk about hostage to the plot The accusation of racism can also be leveled against the film for making the District 9 Mafia Nigerians. Why could they have not just been generic Mafia types? The film degenerates into the ludicrous in the final scene in a showdown between our hero the policeman and the ""over the top"" evil military commander. Although the policeman is armed to the teeth with alien fire power and kills everyone in sight the commander alone survives and proceeds to mash up our hero calling a""halfbreed"" because he is mutating into an alien. Again come on this the torrid racist language of nineteen fifties Western films and in any case the ending is the wrong moment to be exploring themes of racism. All this is a pity because properly developed District 9 could have raised some interesting and relevant issues around migration and oppression. As it is this fails to happen and it is ultimately quite one dimensional and poor.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplySep 19 2009matoFeaturedgreat moviegreat storyone of the best movies now.. realy pleasure to watch.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplySep 19 2009matoFeaturedgreat moviegreat storyone of the best movies now.. realy pleasure to watch.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplySep 17 2009JimFeaturedThis film had serious generic problems.

Ive been looking forward to this a lot having seen it Id have to say that its something of a missed opportunity. I enjoyed it the effects were seamless and well designed the acting (particularly the physical and mental transformation of Wikus) was good but when a film has such a compelling back-story and so much potential comlpexity there is more scope for asking difficult questions of it. I couldnt come up with satisfactory answers to all of these questions. The different requirements of a complex social parable and a summer blockbuster seemed to be pulling the film off kilter it didnt seem fully to know what it wanted to be. I wanted to love this film I only liked it which left me somewhat disappointed.

The aliens are a drain on resources dont contribute more than fishy trafs to the local economy much to the ire of the locals who want shot of them. The job is outsourced to a mega-corporation whos key intent is to move the aliens on at least cost to a tent city out in the bush. The aliens for some unknown reason seem to actually like the tin and cardboard shanty town they reside in and dont want eviction on any terms - then the fun starts.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplySep 13 2009nelson mandelaFeaturedThis is one of the longest Van de Merwe jokes ever - theres no allegory here just a clueless slope following orders.

We do more than just eat cat food. That aside I this was an interesting attempt to present something outside of the same old same old mainstream productions. The plot was rather lame. basically substituting prawns for blacks in the apartheid era type scenario. The alien costumes and spoken language were kinda laughable (and perhaps intentionally ) bit like slightly sophisticated Dr Who creatures (but perhaps intentionally so I think). But this together with the special effects worked in a wierd sort of comical thriller social commentary kind of way. I am taking the DVD back to show the prawns at home. 4 stars for daring to be different and kinda succeedingFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplySep 12 2009dragsterFeaturedI enjoyed this. For once a decent SF-allegory story which maintained my interest. At the start I thought that the prawn were too humanoid in concept and that the failure to explain their arrival was a total cop-out. As the film progressed it became obvious that they had to have humanoid strengths and failings to elicit character sympathy and make the allegory obvious and an overall humanoid build for the the metal-gear section at the end. My criticisms on the film making side is a general plea to avoid the continuing fad for shaki-cam it does not add to the drama what is it supposed to imply that there is a news crew at the site? (so the search team around the shack has a problem locating the fugitive? look at where the boom-mike is pointing simple). My criticism of the plot is that the prawn had made no real plan to exploit their technology and that there were so many questions left unanswered. It must be said however that the prawn promise to return in 3 years was laboured to such an extent that perhaps things are running for a sequel in 2012. If so then I am in favour perhaps we will find out whether it was an exploratory prison or colonisation ship and what went wrong. As it is this film has enough going for it to become a classic it wont be to everybodys taste but that is as it should be. As a final comment I would add that for the past year or so the fewer A list (british viewpoint) actors a film has had the more I have enjoyed them Copleys performance works very well.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplySep 12 2009dragsterFeaturedI enjoyed this.

It utilizes a starving exploited alien race that has been forced to take refuge in Johannesburg as their space ship runs out of fuel the event itself is a media haven which exploits it till every drop of news is extracted from this bewildered alien race . But the director also uses the news footage to force his message home in an intelligent way without dictating the ceremonial propaganda about racial bigotry though there are stereotypes here as well but they serve a purpose to eradicate the notion that aliens will exploit the humanity as cultivated in popular art until today by hollywood itself . The aliens here are guised as crustaceans with half robotic and semi-human appearances as metaphorical symbols of the species that we are currently eradicating in the name of industrialization on earth itselfand they are apparently intelligent though they are preys to the corporate greed of human lust for biological experimentation on other species in horrendous detail . The organisation responsible is named as MULTI -NATIONAL UNITED -MNU -which is rather a hilarious travesty for the obvious and it is responsible for every heinous act possible to these rather sinister but peaceful intelligent species from committing genocide to mass evictions in the name of counter terror in a tale similar to modern day palestine and creation of gitmo bay itself . The human executive responsible for this rather uncivilized act of eradication and eviction as narrated on media as a beneficial and productive act of mercy to the alien victims is the whiningly diplomatic van de merwe-a south african white male in a brilliant act which initiates guised as dark humour and ends in a seriously pensive sensitive mode with surreal overtones . he serves the prawns as the aliens are called by humanity in sheer contempt with eviction notices and accidentally becomes a contaminated victim himself in a freak accident . The narrative from here onwards is fascinating as we see themes of hypocrisy media blackout and administrative lies fill the screen with massacres and necrophilia which is macabre and harrowing but reminds us of what we have seen in the last decade on our television screens itself . Also merwe himself becomes a collectors item which everyone on the planet wants to harvest as a biological wonder and curiosity . This is where Bloekemp has given his movie a soul and a spirit which profoundly moves the human conscience as a rough justice is served though it still remains ironical and grey and the subtlety never gives way to ordinary mayhem despite the realistic action pieces and inventive special effects . This is a maverick director at work and the cast of the bio-mechanical aliens almost becomes human in their plight and empathy which defines the marvel of movie making as an art without any conspicuous gimmicks or megastars . The parts played by south africans and Nigerian warlords could be termed racist but since the setting is similar to Apartheid and the shanty towns of Soweto this becomes an ironical fable and the Nigerians almost become both victims and perpetrators reminiscent of the European colonists and this becomes a triumph as it avoids pushing the the obvious stereotypes in your face but rather works in your subconscious where you are strangely but strategically affected in the last half an hour in a mystical manner itself .FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplySep 8 2009KieranFeaturedGreat story brilliant effects and an excellent leading performance.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplySep 7 2009DieterFeaturedI dragged my girlfriend with me to see this last night.

As a sucker for time-travel romance (Ive considered joining the dewy-eyed souls who make yearly pilgrimages to the lake where Christopher Reeve went loop-de-loop for Jane Seymour in Somewhere in Time) Im over the moon about this movie which smooths out the psychological dissonances in Audrey Niffeneggers fine novel but is still an emotional workout. With no warning (though often when drunk or stressed) Eric Banas Henry is whisked back into the past or ahead to the future which would be more fun if he knew where he was going and his clothes went with him. At age 40 or so Henry leaps back in time and wins the heart of a girl named Clare played by lovely Brooklynn Proulx then Rachel McAdams. (Its a measure of my affection for this film that I didnt dwell on the standard implications of a naked fortyish man calling out from the bushes to a 6-year-old girl.) Ultimately theres no explanation for Henrys gift beyond a genetic abnormality and since he cant alter the pastbutterfly effect shmutterfly effectthe film is steeped in fatalism. It ends up evoking all our emotional waveringsthe ways in which we abandon lovers to relive the past or anticipate the future only sometimes connecting in the moment. Gracefully directed by Robert Schwentke the film has a perfect performance by Bana rangy and haunted never at home in his body. The sole jarring note is Henry and Clares first dance at their weddingto Broken Social Scenes Love Will Tear Us Apart. I might have suggested Love Will Keep Us Together. Passing Strange. The Broadway rock opera by Stew (just Stew) and Heidi Rodewald is captured on film by Spike Lee who sells the material hard but doesnt for once interpose himself. A full-throttle onstage band and a singing narrator (Stew again) chart the journey of an African-American youth called uh Youth (Daniel Breaker) as he searches for fulfillmentfirst with his mama (Eisa Davis) on the south side of L.A. (via church gospel then rock and roll) then in Amsterdam (sex drugs) then in Berlin (anti-bourgeois rants) then back home always leaving people who love him behind. The first act is camp but as the various artistic philosophies accumulate something magical happens This musical about the evolution of an artist becomes a metaphor for itself. When Stew (whos Youth grown up) lectures his younger self that life is a mistake that only art can correct the shows reason for being couldnt be more crystalline. The cutting is hyperkinetic yet Lee is always in synch with the casts phenomenal energy. Hes in their thralland so are we. The Headless Woman. Guilt and alienation from Argentinas Lucrecia Martel so arty enervated and allegorical it might have been made by a European in the early sixties. And yet the lead actress Maria Onetto holds you through the longueurs. The aging affluent dentist hits something with her carwe barely see it but we and she know what it isstops breathes closes her eyes and after an eternity drives away. Everything onscreen conspires to remind her of what she fled a deluge a digging gardener a dead animal on her kitchen counter. Under dry bleached-blond hair she blinks slowly her face placid her manner blandly abstractedbut you can feel her insides churning despair carried by acid reflux. District 9. Part pseudo-documentary part Kafkaesque conversion melodrama part astounding splatterfest. To call this the best shrimp-from-outer-space South African apartheid allegory ever made does not begin to do it justice. But its a start.

Comments (38) click to enlarge District 9 Video Rated R  112 minutes  2009 The setup for this sci-fi adventure is delicious 20 years after a massive spaceship has descended from the heavens stalling over Johannesburg like some intergalactic junker its insectlike passengers inhabit a squalid slum called District 9 while a Blackwater-style corporation tries without success to crack the technological secrets of their advanced weaponry. The parallels to racial apartheid arent exactly subtle but the mockumentary frame allows for plenty of talking-head segments that sketch out a satirical alternate history. Unfortunately as in many such big-screen comic books the backstory beats the hell out of the present-tense plot a routine affair in which a well-meaning doofus working for the Man is infected with a virus starts turning into an alien himself and falls in with the oppressed creatures. Backed by Lord of the Rings producer-director Peter Jackson Neill Blomkamp a South African director of TV commercials adapted his short Alive in Joburg. By J.R.

"District 9 | RichardRoeper.com BLOG On Camera RR YOUTUBE CHANNEL QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS Home    Movie Reviews    District 9 Print Page Email Page Search District 9 (2009; Rated ) B+ "" Gruesome original funny smart."" -Richard Roeper MOVIE INFORMATION District 9(2009; R)In theaters Friday 14 August 2009 Summary An extraterrestrial race forced to live in slum-like conditions on Earth suddenly finds a kindred spirit in a government agent that is exposed to their biotechnology. Genre Action Drama Science Fiction ThrillerDirector Neill BlomkampCast Sharlto Copley On the wings of weeks of breathless fan-boy hype ""District 9"" roars into theaters on Friday adding a much-needed jolt of excitement and originality to the dog days of summer movie releases. This is a gruesome funny smart original piece of filmmaking from first-time director (and Peter Jackson protege) Neill Blomkamp who has potential greatness stamped into his DNA. Shot on a relatively low budget ""District 9"" nevertheless dazzles with special effects and kinetic action sequences----and it has an aliens-among-us story worthy of the Rod Serling or Ray Bradbury catalog. ""District 9"" plays like a mix of styles. Sometimes its as if were watching news footage or a documentary. In other sequences its as if were looking at someones home movies. When the guns blaze and the explosions pop its like a big-budget action film. Think ""Cloverfield"" meets ""Independence Day."" For once an alien spaceship doesnt hover over New York or Washington D.C. As we learn in the opening docu-style sequence this alien ship has been stalled out over Johannesburg for 20 years after running out of fuel. The hard-shelled inhabitants of the ship walk on two legs speak in clicking sounds and are so physically repulsive the locals derisively refer to them as bottom-feeding ""prawns."" Unable to use their sophisticated weaponry or fuel their ship because theyre lacking a certain kind of black fluid the prawns have been ghettoized living in slum camps and separated from the human population. For some reason they dig cat food. They dont seem particularly violent lashing out at each other or at humans only when theyre cornered and desperate or defending their families. Even so the humans in Johannesburg (who not so long ago lived under a different kind of apartheid) want these creatures to go away far away. Anywhere but in their city. So the government enlists a private company called Multinational United (MNU) to round up the prawns and send them to a concentration camp 200 miles outside the city. The MNU operative in charge of the mission is Wikus (Sharlto Copley) a weaselly little mid-level nobody who gets the job because hes married to the bosss daughter. Wikus is a sweaty smarmy creep who delights in taunting the prawns cackling wildly as MNU burns down a shack containing dozens of prawn fetuses gleefully reveling in the ""popping"" sound as the fetuses explode. But then something happens to Wikus something Id rather not reveal here that makes him the most wanted human on the planet and leads to him teaming up with an alien named Christopher Johnson who has been working for years on a plan to re-ignite the spaceship and take his people home. Time and again ""District 9"" gives us four-star gross-out moments. Humans eat alien body parts in the belief it will give them super-strength. Characters die in spectacularly bloody fashion. Heads are severed. Blomkamp and his crew seamlessly blend special effects and location shots and the cast of unknowns does a great job of selling this story. Wikus is by far the most developed character in the story and Copley does brilliant work as we gradually come to like and even admire Wikus. Rarely have we seen a more unlikely hero in a sci-fi film. ""District 9"" is brimming with political metaphors but the script is too smart to hammer us over the head with the messages. We get it but we dont feel as if were being lectured. This is a stunningly original thrill ride a bloody hell of a good time.

"District 9 stars Sharlto Copley Jason Cope David James - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs District 9 stars Sharlto Copley Jason Cope David JamesRating 3 stars (good)August 14 2009|By Michael Phillips TRIBUNE NEWSPAPERS CRITICDistrict 9 Some movies pack such a terrific central idea even their flaws cant stop the train. ""District 9"" is one of them. In its first hour it barrels along with the velocity and assurance of a new classic; as it settles for being a good splattery addition to the venerable aliens-come-calling genre you feel a slight letdown. But that first half? Nice.Pulp moviemakers constantly challenge themselves to find the right sort of realism to lend to a far-out premise. In the case of ""District 9 which is set largely in the hot packed townships of Johannesburg and recasts the apartheid era as an escalating bi-species conflict the movies effectiveness is nearly unthinkable without its location shooting and without its larger allegorical element.The film marks the feature debut for South African-born Canadian resident Neill Blomkamp who co-wrote the script with longtime colleague and fellow Canadian Terri Tatchell. Based on Blomkamps short film ""Alive in ""Joburg"" ""District 9"" sets up its alternate-reality premise beautifully. Twenty years ago an enormous city-size UFO descended from the sky hovered over Johannesburg -- and stayed there revealing nothing of its contents. Then the nations of the world got curious opened it up like a can-opener (we see all this in frantic news footage) and out spilled a million-plus creatures refugees from their home planet.Dubious human solutions to an unwanted immigration wave set off one powder keg after another. The alien ship comes laden with amazingly sophisticated and destructive weaponry. Due to some DNA quirk humans cannot operate the weapons though of course there wouldnt be much of a movie if that were the end of that story. Nicknamed ""prawns"" by a hostile fearful human populace the human-size creatures overrun the shantytowns run afoul of Nigerian gangsters and eventually become the target of a relocation effort overseen by a private security firm known as Multi-National United. The company heads son-in-law a grinning fool played by Sharlto Copley is supposed to be in charge of this operation. But when he runs afoul of a certain alien fluid resembling motor oil ...Theres nothing new about the style of this picture. Blomkamp and his cinematographer Trent Opaloch shoot it like a documentary from the future looking back on recent tragic events. The mock-TV-news footage depicts aliens hopped up on their drug of choice cat food or scenes of human/alien clashes in the shantytowns; the faux-distressed TV-news jiggle is ever-present. But the details are fresh and the early scenes couldnt be better or more vivid. ""This is how something like this would happen"" you think.Then some problems. The pace becomes unvarying as opposed to exhilarating. As the film focuses increasingly on the plight of an alien father and son who hold the key to their species survival the movie tips into more conventional and even sentimental territory (if ""sentimental"" can be used in the sentence as ""ungodly amounts of alien and human guts going blooey""). The casting of Copley is problematic Hes not really an actor; his resume is heavy on producing directing and effects work and his overeager hamming would be better suited to a movie such as ""Dead Alive"" the Peter Jackson zombie romp. ""District 9"" has a different tone and texture and it tucks its blackly comic sense of humor inside a serious situation -- ridiculous but serious. Its pretty grueling in its way and very violent. But in this summer of gargantuan mediocrities a modestly budgeted project with an actual idea in its head and the wiles to manifest it onscreen exploding heads and all -- thats something.- - -MPAA rating R (for bloody violence and pervasive language)Running time 152Starring Sharlto Copley (Wikus Van Der Merwe); Jason Cope (Christopher Johnson); David James (Koobus Venter); Mandla Gaduka (Fundiswa Mhlanga); Vanessa Haywood (Tania)A Tri Star release.

(TriStar Pictures) Joe Neumaier Thursday August 13 2009 345 PM Title District 9 When a smart sci-fi movie takes familiar themes and then goes further than you thought it feels like an evolutionary leap. So few entries in this genre leaves any imprint. ""District 9"" is the exact opposite a memorable monstrous fable thats consistently gripping.Not knowing what happens is crucial -- well go bare bones here dont worry -- but ""District 9"" begins by setting up a common sci-fi scenario Over two decades ago a spaceship appeared over Johannesburg South Africa and simply hovered motionless.Once our military forced its way in however they found millions of starving groggy aliens without any leader. Placed in a filthy shantytown outside Johannesburg called District 9 the ""prawns"" (so-called because they resemble giant crawfish) multiply and soon rebel against the rules enforced on them as South Africa enacts laws to segregate them from humans. While moving the prawns to an even worse encampment an Afrikaaner bureaucrat Wikus (newcomer Sharlto Copley) needs help from a prawn called Christopher after Wikus is unexpectedly used and hunted by his own government agency.Yet Christopher has secrets he doesnt want exposed. And soon so does Wikus.The first 15 minutes of ""District 9"" use handheld cameras and surveillance video images that evoke ""The Blair Witch Project"" and ""28 Days Later"" in their creepiness. Then first-time director Neill Blomkamp -- a protege of ""Lord of the Rings"" filmmaker Peter Jackson who serves as producer -- tells a traditional story parts of which may remind viewers of several classic movies and shows like ""The Outer Limits."" Blomkamp though feasts on the metaphors without ever skimping on the action some of which ranks with the best of its kind.Same goes for the CGI special effects created by New Zealands WETA Workshop (co-founded by Jackson) and responsible for the movies seamless blending of worlds. The ominous giant ship is visible in almost every shot and the insect-shelled prawn have wiry torsos wiggly antennae and expressive eyes a la ""The Fly."" Blomkamp makes Christopher (performed via motion-capture by actor Jason Cope) and his young alien child full-blooded characters that speak in subtitled clicks and grunts but are as real as Wikus and even more sympathetic.Once the more obvious aspects of the genre are addressed -- the movie never feels preachy when dealing with its apartheid allegory -- Blomkamp fills ""District 9"" with some of the summers most edgy and most unsettling thrills. That its full of ideas and even genuine heart make it much more than just another creature feature.

""District 9"" brings their vengeance. Ten-foot alien creatures given the derogatory nickname ""prawns"" land in Johannesburg South Africa in the 1980s only to be (allegory alert) kept in shantytowns and prevented from mingling with the humans. Among their tormenters are (er cancel that allegory?) nasty Nigerians who believe eating the prawny body parts will give them superhuman powers. A blithering bureaucrat (Sharlto Copley) assigned to lead a team charged with evicting the alien prawns by force instead gets infected and starts turning into one. On the plus side this DNA rethink lets him operate laser guns that only the intergalactic bottom-feeders can use. But to his chagrin the evil defense contractors (is there any other kind?) assigned to provide a final solution to the alien problem now want to destroy him. Somewhere in the movie theres also a tender father-son tale about two super-intelligent aliens who are hatching a plan that could change everything. They have only one weakness Theyre addicted to cat food. Personally where gigantic prawn-men are concerned I say bust out the deep fryer and the cocktail sauce first foster interspecies understanding later. The movie produced by Peter Jackson but directed by rookie Neill Blomkamp becomes almost instantly tiresome by using the faux-documentary style that became cliche years ago then repels the audience with the anti-charisma of its oafish lead character. In the second half when it welds bits of ""E.T."" ""Iron Man"" and ""Transformers"" to its ""Starship Troopers"" chassis it provides an eardrum-rearranging burst of shootouts as the military men go up against the giant shrimp. Its a kill-or-be-krill situation. Fans of unrestrained bloody action will find plenty to rouse their spirits particularly in the gung-ho second hour but the movie falls into the same uneasy category as ""Eight Legged Freaks"" too tongue-in-cheek to be thrilling not funny enough to be a comedy. DISTRICT 9 Alle-gory. Running time 111 minutes. Rated R (bloody violence profanity). At the E-Walk the Lincoln Square the Orpheum others.

""District 9"" Movie Review -- Take the man/mutant of ""The Fly"" add the giant strap-on robot of ""Aliens"" spice with some ""Alien Nation"" subtext -- and one dash of ""The Office"" -- and youve got something close to ""District 9."" Youve also got the wildest science-fiction film to come out all year. The story takes place 20 years after an extraterrestrial ship has stalled just outside of -- or rather above -- Johannesburg South Africa. Two decades later the hapless aliens live in walled-off brutally poor ghettos. District 9 (R) TriStar (111 min.) Directed by Neil Blomkamp. With Sharlto Copley. Now playing in New Jersey. STEPHEN WHITTYS RATING THREE STARS Rating note The film contains gory violence and strong language. Its an ugly situation for everyone. The aliens who look like skinny crustaceans and are dubbed ""prawns"" by disgusted humans live on offal and get high off cat food. Policemen keep their boots firmly on the backs of these creatures collective necks. But then one entity -- a multinational conglomerate or government agency its hard to tell them apart these days -- decides theres money in that alien technology. And the key seems to lie in the alien DNA. Cue the Army and the nasty doctors in white lab coats. Its all vaguely ""X-Files."" What director Neil Blomkamp and co-writer Terri Tatchell have done though is tell this story with a bias toward the aliens. The story is told through the eyes of Wikus (Sharlto Copley) a corporate bureaucrat whod make one of Ricky Gervais bumbling characters look competent. A mass of blithe bigotry and squirming obsequiousness Wikus only wants to go along to get ahead. So when his father-in-law appoints him head of a round-up-the-prawns operation Wikus is happy not to ask questions. But when a freak accident begins turning him into a prawn too all order disappears. ""District 9"" originated as a 2005 Blomkamp short film called ""Alive in Joburg"" and it sometimes shows the signs of its growing pains. Its mix of documentary and straight feature styles is jarring. So are the rather large gaps in the plot and a failure to create contrasting characters. Many films struggle to include one memorable villain; this picture has too many. The aliens are crude and ugly and savage. The Nigerian gangsters who prey on them are bloodthirsty sadists. And the South Africans are mostly cruel bigots. Its difficult to care who wins but we spend so much time with Winkus that we eventually throw our lot in with him. Hes a worm sure but at least he eventually turns and maybe even turns into a vertebrate in the process. What powers ""District 9"" really is the images and the action and the effects. (Blomkamp not surprisingly cut his teeth in commercials.) The steaming backdrop of shantytowns is a novel one; the armored tanks and alien blasters are impressive. And so of course are the segmented creatures themselves. But dont be surprised if the final drag-out over-the-top fight reminds you of a smarter better ""Transformers 2"" full of giant robo-monsters and very loud noises. On the downside the whole thing could put you off scampi for a long long while. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

"District 9 - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-AliensMOVIE REVIEW District 9This smart sci-fi film set in South Africa is also a scathing social satire.August 14 2009|Betsy Sharkey FILM CRITIC Set in South Africa in the not too distant past the riveting ""District 9"" begins nearly three decades after a monstrous spaceship lost power over Johannesburg. There it sits still suspended over the city like a giant metal thundercloud.These are stormy days indeed inside District 9 the refugee camp just outside the city built to deal with the huge alien population left stranded by the broken craft. Its one of those ""separate but equal"" shantytowns reeking of garbage and growing dissatisfaction among the Prawns which is as good a slur as any for a race of creatures who look like tall two-legged cockroach/lobsters on steroids.""District 9"" is very smart sci-fi but thats just the beginning; its also a scathing social satire hidden inside a terrific action thriller teeming with gross aliens and regrettable inter-species conflict. And its a blast. . . .Unemployment is rampant in District 9 healthcare is nonexistent -- unless you count those secret scientific experiments -- and crime is on the rise helped along by a Nigerian mafia that specializes in guns and ammo. The Prawns spend their days brawling and getting drunk on cat food which it turns out they have a serious weakness for sending cat food prices soaring. The locals are fed up and pushing for segregation again in South Africa. Dont we ever learn?Meanwhile the Prawns just want to go home. They still dont speak English and humans dont understand much of their synthesized screeches so what we have here is a failure to communicate (though subtitles help us out).The film opens on a drab workstation-filled floor in what turns out to be headquarters for MNU the organization well compensated by the world for managing the aliens. A mass resettlement of District 9 is about to get underway with news cameras rolling and talking heads covering every bit of minutia.Director Neill Blomkamp who wrote the screenplay with Terri Tatchell uses the 24-hour news cycle and its panel of experts to fill out the films complex back story in a form that feels frighteningly familiar. But as with everything else about ""District 9"" theres more to it than that.At the center of our story is a pocket-protector MNU middle manager named Wikus Van De Merwe played by Sharlto Copley well known in South African film and television circles. Hes an unlikely hero with the demeanor of a 50s-era science teacher in a short-sleeve white shirt and horn rims (in a very loose way the film has a 1950s feel). Wikus has been picked to oversee the resettlement project in part because hes an ordinary Joe who the higher-ups think will play well on TV with its live news feed transmitting his every move.But like a reality TV show gone terribly wrong (or right) bad things begin to happen once Wikus steps inside the district with a series of accidents and events turning him into a wanted man.You can feel his pain as he realizes that the company hes spent a lifetime working for has abandoned him when he needs it most.A great deal of action and insight accompanies Wikus as he tries to evade authorities and the medical teams who are suddenly quite interested in his alien exposure. He finds allies where he least expects them among the Prawns specifically a strategic leader named Christopher Johnson (Jason Cope) and his young prawn spawn little C.J. who is bright funny and created completely by special effects so they say.Despite the language barriers understanding grows and not surprisingly Wikus begins to see another side of things aliens driven by needs not unlike his own.Violence of varying stripes runs through the film and within the bloody mess some very nifty camera work is going on. As bullets penetrate flesh or crack shell the camera shifts throwing you right in the middle of things the pieces raining down around you.Its like nothing Ive experienced and if theyd gone 3-D with it Id have probably run for cover.The action sequences are aggressive and extensive. The metal eco-skeletons that the aliens can slip into and the assault rifles they pick up are theirs exclusively because the machines respond only to alien DNA.The choice to make the aliens particularly gross is an intriguing one. No ethereal eyes to peer into no close encounters desired given the rows of nasty-looking pincers on their bellies. Its a lot to get past on the road to tolerance.Humor and there is that too comes in the form of irony. But then Blomkamp has seeded irony and analogies throughout ""District 9"" as he makes his way through a myriad of modern anxieties including the racial divide class differences big business broadcast news and the big-brother world of reality TV.1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESDistrict 9s Neill Blomkamp does more with lessAugust 20 2009Sharlto Copley moves in front of the camera for District 9August 13 2009Ponyo District 9 Jessie James Shark Tank Iron...August 9 2009Neill Blomkamps District 9 wins over fanboys and Peter...August 2 2009MORE STORIES ABOUTAliensAfricaCat FoodCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword",http://articles.latimes.com/2009/aug/14/entertainment/et-district14,200,district914,district9,latimes

Media San Francisco Chronicle District 9 Sci-fi thriller. Directed by Neill Blomkamp. Starring Sharlto Copley. (R. 112 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Every now and then a film comes along that both defies and compels description. ""District 9"" is one such movie a science-fiction action vehicle so brilliantly and fully imagined that real life when it resumes after the credits arrives with a new sense of dread. You may well believe that a huge alien mother ship has been hovering over Johannesburg for the past 20 years. Youll feel sick in your gut at the events that occurred there. Revealing much more of the plot at this point would ruin the sucker-punch force of its storytelling but people who cant stomach violence should keep their distance; be advised that heads explode limbs detach and bodies go sploosh in an instant. With that warning aside this is categorically one of the best releases of the year - a spellbinding genre flick thats also a corrosive assault on the baroque inhumanity of common human beings.

Photo David Bloomer AP Review District 9 packs a spellbinding punch 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Directed and co-written by Neill Blomkamp and produced by ""Lord of the Rings"" lord Peter Jackson ""District 9"" opens with a documentary-style recap of the aliens mysterious arrival in South Africa and their systematic placement in shantytowns that echo apartheid. The aliens are bipedal exoskeletal and vaguely crustacean with lobster claws that snap from their midriffs and tentacular writhing mouths. South Africans call them ""prawns."" They speak in gurgling clicks - subtitled for our convenience but understood perfectly well by the humans whove been oppressing them for two decades. We meet one such oppressor early on a smiling drone named Wikus Van De Merwe (an impressive Steve Carell-ish Sharlto Copley hereby launched into a huge career) whos responsible for moving all 1.8 million aliens into a new encampment hundreds of kilometers outside Johannesburg. As talking heads comment ominously on the events that unfolded shaky-cam footage tracks Wikus door-to-door interaction with the clacking recalcitrant prawns. Two of them a father and son become vitally important to the story. So does Wikus. ""District 9"" deftly weaves the faux-documentary gimmick with more forthright narrative segments and all-out upscale action mayhem and is unlike any other human-versus-extraterrestrial film in recent memory. I simply refuse to spoil it for you. Its that good. Bloody suspenseful excoriating and flecked through with pathos and humor ""District 9"" is science fiction at its killer chiller best. -- Advisory Bloody violence and pervasive language. review Most Popular 1 Dear Abby I want to contact mistress from 45 years ago 2 Cops Son of billionaire former supermodel arrested after... 3 Ann Coulter Hammered by Conservatives for Smearing US War... 4 Iceland man says Donald Trumps son left white powder at... 5 Dear Abby I dont want anyone to know that Ive retired 6 Bikini-clad Swedish cop makes arrest while sunbathing 7 Oakland-bound medical plane crashes -- 4 killed 8 Police Girl 14 slits teens throat in hope of first kill 9 Inmate charged in 2015 quadruple slaying in S.F. 10 Parilia Ball - San Francisco orgiastic event from almost a...

Rick Groen From Thursdays Globe and Mail Published Wednesday Aug. 12 2009 327PM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 319PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English District 9 Directed by Neill Blomkamp Written by Neill Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell Starring Sharlto Copley and Vanessa Haywood Classification 14A Typically when intergalactic aliens pay a house call on Earth they come either with evil intentions or innocent eyes. The first makes for hot action and were the good guys fighting battles royal against the dastardly intruders. The second leads to cold satire and were the wicked guys getting a lecture on our immoral tendencies and primitive ways. So give District 9 some sci-fi credit Right off it avoids these well-travelled roads to blaze a trail both different and compelling. But then the trail disappears leaving us with a yes-and-no movie. Yes the premise is delightful; no the delight doesnt last. The setting is Johannesburg where 20 years ago the mother ship arrived bearing its unearthly cargo a species technologically advanced but physically inferior and apparently prone to massive screw-ups. Like the one that left them separated from their ride home and at the mercy of their increasingly disgruntled hosts. In the decades since the abandoned ship has deteriorated from flying saucer to hovering cloud permanently hung over the city like a grey lament. Meanwhile the aliens themselves have become well aliens illegal refugees ghettoized in a Soweto-like township of corrugated shacks and abject poverty. Sure this being South Africa the allegorical intentions are painfully obvious. But director Neill Blomkamp keeps both the allegory and the pain in close check - he never hits us over the head with it. Rather his hand-held camera buzzes around the predicament like a keen videographer on a freelance assignment. En route we get to glimpse the aliens who oozing slime and sporting tentacles look like oversized crustaceans begging for the boiling pot. Evolved to the point of walking on two claws they are upright in stance if nothing else. Or so say the locals who black and white alike dismiss the filthy ""prawns"" as a shiftless horde prone to overbreeding and addictive habits. Seems their abused substance of choice is cat food - starving they go wild for the stuff. These establishing scenes are intriguing and the familiar racial profiling - unconventional beings subjected to conventional stereotypes - demands to be examined. After all the prawns appear to have a social structure children and families; they even speak a guttural language thats conveniently subtitled. So the script promises to enter their camp and explore their oppression - to humanize the aliens. Instead unwisely it does just the reverse choosing to ""alienate"" a human. That would be Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley) the none-too-bright bureaucrat who begins as the villain of the piece the civil servant charged with the task of evicting the prawns all 1.8 million of them from their current ghetto to an even more outlying district far removed from the offended citizenry. A breezy mix of pomp and prejudice Wikus tackles the mass eviction with a happy zeal at least until he accidentally ingests a canister full of alien ""fluid."" Cue the metamorphosis - suddenly the guy is losing his teeth and gaining tentacles. Just as suddenly what began as a nifty premise morphs into a cluttered scenario chockablock with the usual riff-raff. Oh theres a ruthless mercenary and a savage warlord and the inevitable cold-hearted corporation this time intent on unlocking the DNA secret to the aliens bio-weaponry and you know ruling the world. Amid this growing mess poor Wikus continues his journey from earthling to alien hunter to hunted supercilious villain to sympathetic victim even as his newly sprouted claw carries a torch for his beloved wife Tania (Vanessa Haywood). Speaking of clutter and love our transforming hero receives a helpful assist from a father prawn devoted to his young son - clearly just like us those jumbo shrimps adore their juniors. Id like to have gotten to know them better but by then the picture is bursting with battles royal - with bullets buzzing flames bursting blood flowing crustaceans crackling. The fresh premise over the stale action returns. Having exhausted its blazed trail District 9 simply steers back to the rutted road of excess.

"The dull anti-corporate politics of District 9. Slate Sign In Sign Up The dull anti-corporate politics of District 9. The dull anti-corporate politics of District 9. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Aug. 13 2009 650 PM They Came From the Boardroom The dull anti-corporate politics of District 9. By Daniel Engber Sharlto Copley in District 9 We like to imagine that the alien invasion when it finally comes will augur some cataclysm of joy or violence. If were lucky the visitors might dazzle us with a musical starship (Close Encounters of the Third Kind) or pleasure us with cosmic sex energy (Cocoon). Or perhaps theyll descend from grim saucers to steal our water (Independence Day) or harvest our blood as crop fertilizer (War of the Worlds). Were so inclined to construe the invaders as either angels or demons that we rarely consider another perhaps more disturbing scenario What if we make contact with aliens and they turn out to be a bunch of intergalactic schlubs? Daniel Engber Daniel Engber is a columnist for Slate. The story of Neill Blomkamps District 9 picks up several decades after an enormous clunker of a spaceship has more or less broken down in the skies over South Africa. Its passengers--hordes of dim shiftless insectoids--have spent the intervening years living as impoverished refugees in a walled-off Johannesburg ghetto. Advertisement The films nifty marketing campaign emphasized the alien-apartheid theme. A series of interviews posted online shows seemingly regular folks answering questions like ""Do you believe aliens deserve equal rights?"" Meanwhile mock-Jim Crow signage has popped up in major cities--posters warning that bus stops are ""for humans only."" Yet the most effective advertisement for the movie is the six-minute short that Blomkamp created several years ago which spawned the feature film. Alive in Joburg is a clever composite of fake news footage and man-on-the-street interviews that manages to inspire a startling pathos for the downtrodden aliens. They appear huddled around garbage-can fires in hooded sweatshirts and wrapped with blankets. Their faces are blurred out as if they were criminals on an episode of COPS and we see only the ends of tentacles dangling from their chins. As they grunt plaintively in an alien language subtitles appear across the bottom of the screen ""give us electricity ... the place here we cannot adapt ... give us running water that we may hydrate ... we are stuck."" Im amazed that Blomkamp can evoke so much feeling in just a few minutes of video. And Im sad at how quickly he dispenses with it in the feature film. As an allegory of racial conflict and mass immigration District 9 never really goes anywhere The appealing premise fades into the background before 20 minutes have elapsed. We learn that the aliens will be forcibly relocated from their Johannesburg shantytown to a refugee camp 2000 kilometers away and that the details are to be overseen by a sinister corporation called Multi-National United with a government contract. The movies hero Wikus van der Merwe is a nebbishy bureaucrat in MNUs Department of Alien Affairs who looks and acts like an Afrikaner version of Michael Scott. Wikus has been assigned to oversee the relocation of the ""prawns"" (as theyre called by the locals) a task he embarks upon with great enthusiasm until fate conspires to reveal that the true monsters in this story are his corporate overlords. Under the pretense of helping the refugees MNU scientists are instead working feverishly to commercialize a stockpile of alien weapons. Theyre also using live aliens for target practice for no discernible reason. (The other more serious holes in the storys logic are too numerous to list here.) Advertisement And so the film abandons any pretense of exploring the dynamics of social upheaval. Instead were treated to yet another take on the evils of corporatism. Could there be a more egregious sci-fi cliche? In Moon we had Lunar Industries Ltd.; in Wall-E it was Buy N Large; Blade Runner featured the Tyrell Corp. And lets not forget the executives from the bio-weapons division of Weyland-Yutani who cause all the carnage in Aliens. (While were on the topic How lame is it that the megacorporation from District 9 is called ""Multi-National United""? If you can think of a more obvious witless name from the annals of anti-corporate science-fiction e-mail me.) Its a little odd if you think about it that District 9--and the whole sci-fi genre--should be so hung up on this one issue. Especially since creatures that arrive from another planet so clearly stand in for humans who arrive from another country space aliens illegal aliens. On the io9 blog Charlie Jane Anders has argued that the archetypes of science-fiction are refugees; indeed a long list of sci-fi novels explore the theme of immigration in great detail. Film directors too have in the past used stories of marooned aliens to examine race relations (e.g. Brother From Another Planet Alien Nation) and assimilation (e.g. The Man Who Fell to Earth Superman). Yet recent sci-fi cinema continues to dwell on the corporate menace. Perhaps Im asking too much of District 9. According to the LosAngeles Times Blomkamp worried that by delving too deep into social commentary ""the film would become too serious and oppressive and that it wouldnt be entertaining on a popcorn level. "" Fair enough. We also learn that he ""tacked the word SATIRE in giant letters to his office wall as a kind of working manifesto."" I suppose its his prerogative to depict a race of aliens trapped in a South African ghetto while at the same time striving to keep things lighthearted. But if thats the goal I could have done without the obligatory anti-corporate message. Dude lets just keep things on a popcorn level OK?

Posted August 11 2009 0355 pm - Updated August 12 2009 0502 pm By CARY DARLING Movie review District 9 goes for brains heart and soul This might go down as the year that science-fiction cinema despite the deafening crash and clangor of sparring robots began to rediscover its brains heart and soul. In ""Moon"" Sam Rockwell gives a stellar performance as a lonely lunar worker sinking ever deeper into despair and possible delusion. Now comes ""District 9"" an impressively eye-popping yet cannily intelligent blast of social commentary from first-time features director Neill Blomkamp that may be remembered as a classic of the form. When aliens arrive in a derelict ship that hovers over Johannesburg seemingly blotting out half the sky neither the heady promise of beneficial first contact nor the harrowing prospect of ruthless invasion are realized. Instead its discovered that those on board are not diplomats or soldiers but refugees of sorts malnourished frightened and confused. Not knowing what to do with them the government (through an organization called Multi-National United or MNU) brings the aliens - who look like bipedal crustaceans - into the city yet separate them from humans by forcing them to live in District 9 which soon turns into a sordid shantytown. However distrust and disgust seem to be the only feelings humans and aliens have for each other so MNU builds a new more remote facility District 10. Enter Wikus Van de Merwe (Sharlto Copley) a good-natured yet middling MNU corporate hack who nabs a high-level promotion no doubt thanks to his well-placed father-in-law. His new job overseeing the eviction and relocation of aliens from District 9 to District 10. But Wikus is in way over his officious head. The day turns into an orgy of ineptitude and violence. To make matters worse he has accidentally ingested an alien substance an action that leads him to see the world through the eyes of his captives. Although analagous to the real-life events of apartheid-era District 6 in Cape Town - in which 60000O people were forcibly removed from the city center and placed in the dusty Cape Flats - ""District 9"" speaks to contemporary times where much of the world through war famine or despotism is on the move seeking refuge. But ""District 9"" is no dry exercise in social studies. Produced by New Zealands Peter Jackson (""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy) the film turns into a full-blown action film perhaps too much so by the end. Yet its savvy in its use of technology - the aliens feel as authentic as any of the humans - without being overwhelmed by it. South African-reared/Canadian-based Blomkamp whose 2005 ""Alive in Joburg"" short subject provided the basic premise for this film veers between documentary and narrative styles in ""District 9"" without ever being jarring. Though the movie couldve been set anywhere and made its same points that it takes place wholly in urban Africa and is peopled solely with black and white South Africans - unusual for a movie aimed at a mainstream global market - make ""District 9"" completely original. But what keeps the film anchored most in reality is Copley who in what is his first feature as well turns in a performance that is both riveting and moving. Like Rockwells character in ""Moon"" Wikus discovers a depth of humanity he never knew he had precisely at the time when humanity may be turning its back on him. ""District 9"" is not without its flaws. There are leaps of logic (now just why would the U.S. EU UN Russia and China let South Africa take the lead on first contact?) and cultural stereotyping (brutish white South African special ops soldiers; superstitious bloodthirsty Nigerian gangsters) that borders on the comic-book. Still Blomkamp has created a unique universe that like the best science fiction takes us to a world weve never seen while reflecting a world we all know too well.

Sony Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? The ad campaign for the sci-fi thriller ""District 9"" with mysterious billboards touting aliens among us is highly creative and amusing. So in patches is the movie which is a thinking mans or man-boys ""Transformers."" Its about what happens when a spaceship filled with human-sized four-legged prawnlike extraterrestrials comes to rest in the sky above Johannesburg South Africa. Twenty-eight years have passed and the ""prawns"" as they are derisively called have been ghettoized on the ground by earthlings and ruled over by military types eager to figure out how to use the aliens space-age weapons. When one of the operatives (Sharlto Copley) who is hired to oversee the prawns becomes part prawn himself the plot thickens into a regular bouillabaisse of bam-pow pyrotechnics. Peter Jackson was the producer and aficionados of his early ghoul movies like ""Dead Alive"" will detect his handiwork here. The first-time director was Neill Blomkamp a native South African who no doubt is attempting not altogether unreasonably to draw a line between alien confinement and apartheid.

"District 9 A sign of intelligent life in dumb days of summer | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentDistrict 9 A sign of intelligent life in dumb days of summerDistrict 9 is an imaginative idea wrapped in familiar garb - so much so theres a risk of overlooking director Neill Blomkamps cunning twists of sci-fi convention.The aliens face full of tentacles recalls Davey Jones in Pirates of the Caribbean -- it makes emotional connections almost impossible.  (COURTESY OF TRISTAR PICTURES)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Aug. 13 2009 District 9 (out of 4)Starring Sharlto Copley Jason Cope Eugene Khumbanyiwa David James and Vanessa Haywood. Directed by Neill Blomkamp. 111 minutes. At major theatres. 14A District 9 is an imaginative idea wrapped in familiar garb - so much so theres a risk of overlooking director Neill Blomkamps cunning twists of sci-fi convention.It concerns the arrival on Earth of bothersome aliens an event so familiar to moviegoers its liable to elicit more yawns than shrieks from the audience. Alien tourists have been treated seriously (The Day the Earth Stood Still) and not so seriously (Mars Attacks) for almost as long as there have been movies.Think of how Blomkamp might have made this. He could have fashioned the aliens to be as cuddly as E.T. or WALL-E to elicit sympathy in their similar plight of being stranded on a hostile planet. Instead hes made them insect-like and repulsive scorned by humans under the pejorative term ""prawns."" You have to overcome your gag reflex to even look at them especially when subplots involving alien sex and cannibalism kick in.Blomkamp could have made his human protagonist a dashing hero someone like Will Smith in Independence Day. Instead Blomkamp puts the dramatic burden on wiry newcomer Sharlto Copley whose bureaucratic alien wrangler Wikus van der Merwe is like a cross between Adolf Hitler and Inspector Clouseau. Blomkamp could also have made much more of the films Johannesburg setting and allusions to South African apartheid a racist divide of blacks and whites that officially ended a generation ago yet is still being sorted out at street level. Instead the filmmaker lets his images carry the films unspoken message colour becomes irrelevant when all of humanity feels threatened.All of these risky - and thoughtful - choices make District 9 a far more forceful movie than your average alien invasion saga. In a summer where toy robots and action heroes have rocked the box office and killed brain cells its nice to see a movie where some serious thought has been put into reviving a stale genre.Blomkamp a South African-born Canadian currently based in Vancouver has had the advantage of several years of thinking and tweaking to improve his film. District 9 began as a 2005 viral web short called Alive in Joburg which formed the nucleus of the tale. Refugee aliens arrive in a giant spaceship from a dying planet seeking to make use of Earths electricity and water and hoping Earthlings will happily share. Instead the humans respond by rounding up the docile aliens and locking them behind barbed wire in a filthy shantytown shades of the ghettos of Soweto. With the production support of his mentor Peter Jackson (The Lord of the Rings) and co-writing with fellow Canadian Terri Tatchell Blomkamp expanded on the concepts of Alive in Joburg to make District 9 a smart and mostly satisfying sci-fi excursion retaining its faux documentary style handheld cinematography and low-budget blockbuster brio.Copleys Wikus seems like a standard-issue government bureaucrat although he works for a private company called Multi-National United (MNU). The firm is tasked with managing a motley band of aliens - which have almost doubled in number since one million of them arrived near death 20 years earlier. Comfort for these creatures isnt the issue. MNU just wants to herd them into a bigger concentration camp called District 10 about 200 kilometres away from Johannesburg. Out of sight out of mind for the docile ""prawns"" who possess weapons but dont fire them and who savour tins of cat food one of the films many dark satiric touches.Wikus is in charge of the evacuation of District 9 a job he approaches with gusto and some recklessness. Something happens that dramatically changes his circumstances both physically and mentally. He becomes a hunted man wanted by both his former MNU allies and by Nigerian gangster Obesandjo (Eugene Khumbanyiwa) who wants to exploit the alien weaponry.Wikus crosses paths with a highly evolved alien the humans have dubbed Christopher (Jason Cope) a dad who is determined to protect his young son. Desperate times make for strange allies.Its only when the film yields to violence in the final stretch that it begins to lose some of its creative heat. Theres also the dilemma that the aliens are just too far out to empathize with. They have a face full of tentacles - something like Davey Jones in Pirates of the Caribbean - that makes emotional connections almost impossible. How do you look an insect in the eye? They also speak in a language that requires subtitles.District 9 is almost too smart for its own good. But it asks a serious question Arent extraterrestrials people too?And youve got to love a movie that takes a few big chances when almost everybody else is just doing the same old thing.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

It sends him reeling forward and backward in time without rhyme without reason without warning--and without clothes. Theres a fair bit of light fiction that plays much more winningly on screen than between book covers. ""The Devil Wears Prada"" is one such example. Some pop lit clips along reasonably well on the page but on screen reveals itself for the claptrap it truly is. Here ""The Da Vinci Code"" springs immediately to mind. Let me come clean right off and say that I have not read Ms. Niffeneggers book. Perhaps its just one of those novels that defies translation to the screen. Or perhaps what we have here is yet one more instance of Hollywood taking a poignant nuanced page-turner and turning it into a tale told by a nitwit signifying absolutely nothing but providing many unintentional laughs. This of course is a matter best left to the authors myriad fans who bless them are probably already lining up at the cineplex. ENLARGE Rachel McAdams as the title character in The Time Travelers Wife Warner Bros. In any case the turgid screen adaptation of ""The Time Travelers Wife"" stars Eric Bana as Henry the accidental ecdysiast and Rachel McAdams as Clare the long-suffering but patient-as-Penelope title character. The two first meet when Clare is a 10-year-old having a picnic in a meadow and naked-as-a-jaybird Henry is hiding in the bushes for reasons of modesty and a PG-13 rating. Clare gives Henry her blanket and her heart. Through the years if I can make any sense of this nonsense he makes periodic visits back to the meadow solidifying the intensity of her feelings. Now an adult Clare is finally in the same time zone as Henry and wants to make a life with him. But what kind of future can she expect with a time-travelin man? And heres the thing Henry is just such an uninteresting time traveler. Unlike other fictional characters blessed--or cursed--with the gift of shuttling off to last year or next decade he never witnesses great moments in history or in the distant future never meets anybody of note. Unfortunately hes also incapable of altering the course of events. He just toddles off leaving a heap of clothes on the floor (so like a man) to show hes good and gone. Dont count on him for dinner or New Years Eve. Mr. Bana who seems to have two modes of acting shaven and unshaven and the ill-used Ms. McAdams dont generate much heat. But clearly the two of them are suffering mightily. Their situation is hopeless and so is their dialogue. ""I come from the future"" says Henry. ""You forced yourself into the mind and heart of a little girl"" says Clare. Heres the take-home message Love conquers all and time is fleeting. Viewers will likely think otherwise. The movie moves at such an agonizingly stately pace that by the end side effects be damned Henrys time-traveling gene starts to look mighty appealing. Ponyo ENLARGE A goldfish transformed into a little girl scampers over the waves in Ponyo. Disney It doesnt get screen credit but the big beautiful and often temperamental star of Hayao Miyazakis latest animated charmer ""Ponyo"" is the ocean. In this loose adaptation of Hans Christian Andersens ""The Little Mermaid"" (no relation to Disneys ""Little Mermaid"") typhoon-tossed waves--in terrific two-dimensional renderings--morph suddenly into dolphins that dissolve back into water then back once again into fish. Brunhild a mischievous strong-minded goldfish (the voice of Noah Cyrus Mileys younger sister) is determined to become a little girl when shes rescued from a jar and befriended by Sosuke (the voice of Frankie Jonas the Jonas Brothers kid brother) a plucky self-reliant 5-year-old. He feeds his new pal ham (oh ever so much better than plankton) becomes the most diligent of protectors and dubs her Ponyo. Sosukes mother (the voice of Tina Fey) an administrator at a senior center is perfectly tolerant about the whole thing (even though Ponyo as a little girl is a bit of a hyperactive handful). Not so Brunhilds father (the voice of Liam Neeson) a dissipated-looking sorcerer with a ringmasters coat streaming seaweed hair and a harried expression (possibly because hes the single parent of hundreds of impish little daughters possibly because of the wreck that environmentally careless human beings have made of the underwater world and the world above). If the plot of ""Ponyo"" is small as a minnow its themes--the relationship between parent and child between the young and the elderly between friends between man and nature--are large and fully realized. District 9 Major urban centers like Manhattan and Washington are popular destinations for alien spacecraft in science-fiction movies. But in the often inventive apartheid parable ""District 9"" directed by Neill Blomkamp a protege of ""Lord of the Rings"" auteur Peter Jackson the spacecraft in question lands in Johannesburg. ENLARGE Sharlto Copley is armed and ready in District 9 TriStar Pictures Its been 20 years since the vehicle stalled out above the city. Its passengers--a teeming mass of creatures resembling arachnids that eat cat food and speak in a guttural patois that requires subtitles--are coralled into a shantytown. There they are shunned by the dregs of the dregs of society viewed with suspicion by the government and derisively nicknamed ""prawns."" Prawn spawn are routinely aborted. The local human population is relieved to hear at long last of plans to move the prawns to a new camp many kilometers outside the city. But amid the complicated attempts at relocation Wikus van de Merwe (the very good Sharlto Copley)--an officious bureaucrat in way over his head--is hit by a virus that starts turning him into an alien. This makes him a prawn of great interest to a sinister corporation and threatens to break up his marriage. Its also the catalyst for loyal company man Wikus to examine his own prejudices and rock-bound belief system. ""District 9"" begins in cinema verite style with a collection of talking heads--one speaker is identified as ""the head of alien relations"" another as an entomologist yet another as a human-rights activist--to bring viewers up to speed. Earnestly they meditate about such troubling social issues as prawn gangs and ""interspecies prostitution."" Theres a wonderfully sly farcical verve to these early moments but it dissipates when the script with its strains of ""E.T."" and ""The Fly"" moves into high sci-fi gear. DVD FOCUS Portrait of Jennie (1948) Joseph Cotten is Eben Adams a starving disillusioned New York artist in this fantasy. Walking through Central Park one day he meets Jennie Appleton a pretty voluble young girl whos wearing puzzlingly old-fashioned clothing and who leaves behind a decades-old newspaper the first of many clues that shes of another time and another world. The bedazzled Eben makes a sketch of Jennie then paints what becomes a celebrated portrait--hes found his muse and lost his heart--but every time he sees his mysterious subject she seems to have aged a few years. Time After Time (1979) Its the London of 1893 and the police are hot on the trail of Jack the Ripper who has just struck again in Nicholas Meyers terrific whirligig. Their search takes them to the home of H.G. Wells (Malcolm McDowell) where a dinner party is in progress and where the author is about to unveil a real-life version of the time machine he immortalized in his novel ""The Time Machine."" The constables believe that Wellss physician friend may be the killer but before they can nab him he hops into his hosts curious device and escapes almost a century into the future with H.G. making determined chase. Spirited Away (2001) Chihiro a sulky 10-year-old girl is moving with her family to a new town in Hayao Miyazakis magical fantasy an Oscar winner for best animated feature. They take a wrong turn and the shortcut chosen by Chihiros father leads down a pathway inhabited by spirits then to what seems like an abandoned amusement park.

Aldo Raine of the ""basterds"" Jewish-American soldiers getting revenge on the Nazis. ABOUT THE MOVIEInglourious Basterds   1/2 (out of four)Stars Christoph Waltz Brad Pitt Diane Kruger Daniel Brhl Mlanie Laurent Eli Roth B.J. NovakDirector Quentin TarantinoDistributor The Weinstein CompanyRating R for strong graphic violence language and brief sexualityRunning time 2 hours 32 minutesOpens Friday nationwide WATCH THE VIDEO By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Pure exhilaration is in woefully short supply at the movies. But within one week two films offer a bracing dose of this rare commodity first District 9 the most inventive sci-fi action film of the summer and now the invigorating Inglourious Basterds. Within the first frames of writer/director Quentin Tarantinos audacious dismantling of history you may feel as if you took a hit of pure oxygen. His tall tale with its tense and jangly pacing is immediately riveting. Loosely based on Enzo Castellaris 1978 film Basterds is brash nimbly acted and and not surprisingly for a Tarantino movie incessantly violent. But with its wartime setting what bloody mayhem there is feels integral and for the most part appropriate. This wish-fulfillment fantasy baldly reinvents history beginning in 1941 in the Nazi-occupied French countryside. Nazi Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) bursts into a farmhouse oozing malevolence and savage grace. He smugly toys with a taciturn farmer like a menacing cat batting at a mouse he could devour at will. But hes after something bigger a Jewish family in hiding. Landa is one of the most spellbindingly despicable characters written for the screen. His cruelty barely disguised by a patina of charm Landa is portrayed brilliantly by Waltz. Come Oscar time expect to see the Austrian-born actor on the short list. Teenage Shosanna (Melanie Laurent) survives Landas vicious execution of her family and tears off. With her desperate flight the film surges into powerful stomach-churning overdrive. Several years later now the owner of a small cinema in Paris Shosanna plots against the Nazis her vendetta following a parallel course to that of the ""basterds"" a corps of Jewish-American soldiers bent on exacting quick and painful vengeance on all Nazis who cross their path. Brad Pitt anchors the standout cast as good ol boy Lt. Aldo Raine the head basterd. Raine and his men concoct a daring scheme to eliminate key members of the Third Reich assisted by a duplicitous German actress (Diane Kruger). Tarantino avoids some of the linguistic contortions that often arise in war films. In American movies Nazis speak English with either gruff German intonations or arch British accents. But Tarantino deals with the problem more directly. For example Landa speaks French to the farmer -- we get subtitles -- then asks if he can switch to English because he has exhausted his French. The exchange works seamlessly. The madness could have been dialed down in the drawn-out grisly climax. But Tarantino is renowned for being a cinephile as well as a filmmaker. And in Basterds-- with its focus on Shosannas theater and a violent film-within-a-film that figures prominently in the climax -- he exercises both his obsession with vengeance and his fascination with the movies. The outcome is gory and glorious. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Reader Editor Brent Jones.

Starring Sharlto Copley David James Director Neill Blomkamp Running time 153 Release Opened Aug 14 2009  Editorial Review District 9 In Many Ways Its a Perfect 10By John AndersonSpecial to The Washington PostAugust 14 2009The poison that permeates the phenomenal ""District 9"" is the same toxin that has defined so much of human history The oppression of the Other. In this case that means scaly aliens with feelers for faces who are confined to South African-style ""townships"" and who in director-writer Neill Blomkamps allegorical thrill ride represent every tyrannized population since the institution of the pogrom. A sci-fi-fueled indictment of mans inhumanity to man -- and the non-human -- ""District 9"" is all horribly familiar and transfixing.That Blomkamp a South African would set his propulsive kinetic and relentlessly nerve-racking thriller in a barely reformed South Africa indicates that subtle political messages are not his forte. Nor are they necessarily his objective. This is an action movie after all Cruel twists of fate narrow escapes well-deserved liquidations and unlikely alliances all make for a classic summer shoot-em-up. Still the underlying gravitas of the story -- in which the aliens are Gitmoed and used for gruesome experiments -- keeps ""District 9"" smart even after the aliens start turning their oppressors into Heinz 57 sauce.In a crisp rapid-fire setup ""District 9"" establishes how the ominous mothership came to a halt in the sky over Johannesburg then sat motionless for months as earthly authorities pondered what to do. In frustration and desperation a team was sent to cut its way into the ship where the alien passengers were found weak and malnourished. Taken to the ground but having no way back to the ship the aliens became a sub-population of unwanted immigrants whose disgusting looks and strange appetites -- theyre partial to canned cat food -- make them a collective object of fear and loathing. As we reach the films version of present day the history has led to a crackdown replete with evictions violence and internment.""District 9"" is the rare arms-and-ammo flick in which the central human performance is as high-caliber as the hardware. Acting newcomer Sharlto Copley as craven corporate tool Wikus van de Merwe gives a performance that is nothing short of tour de force. Assigned to oversee the relocation of the aliens -- or ""prawns"" as theyre derisively called (they do resemble shrimp) -- Wikus has gotten his job through his father-in-law the head of the evil MNU (MultiNational United). He has no leadership abilities whatsoever; in carrying out the evictions of the aliens Wikus demonstrates that he is in fact a natural coward. Hes the kind of bureaucratic creature who overuses his authority because its all hes got. Hes despicable. And Copleys portrayal is precise and true. That he manages to make Wikus a hero however marginal is close to miraculous.The films producer Peter (""Lord of the Rings"") Jackson has a kindred spirit in Blomkamp who has a flair for the same kind of humorous violence Jackson showed early in his career (see ""Meet the Feebles"") and for a judicious but effective use of creepout embellishments A prawn breeding ground is rich in viscous visuals; the claustrophobic alien hovels reek of dust and decay; the aliens themselves are rangy revolting characters almost ratlike in their paranoia and Otherness. Theyre hard to like but we like them just as we end up rooting for the demise of Greater Human Civilization. That we barely get to catch our breath is not a bad thing either.Contains bloody violence and vulgarity.

More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Not this time. Jackson and South African writer-director Neill Blomkamp have made District 9 a thriller-diller that trades in ideas without forgetting to go whup-ass on your nervous system. The R-rated District 9 is all kinds of awesome -- and not just to geeks. Blomkamp 29 is a talent to watch. Raised in Johannesburg before moving to Canada he dreamed of combining his interest in sci-fi with the tormented world of racism and xenophobia he grew up in. District 9 is an expansion of the six-minute short Alive in Joburg that he made in 2005 which Jackson had already admired. Using a documentary style with harsh lighting and hand-held cameras he sets the scene for the vividly real horrors that follow. A spaceship hovers over Johannesburg. It stalled there 28 years ago when apartheid policies segregated nonwhites into Soweto-like townships. Alien refugees have been closed off from humans in the slums of District 9. Despite their mental acuity they are demeaned as ""prawns"" for their crustacean-shell armor and the mouth tentacles that wiggle madly when they speak in gurgles in our language and in their own. Blomkamp and co-writer Terri Tatchell are not above having a laugh at say the aliens jones for cat food cans and all and the popularity of interspecies prostitution. But there is serious business in watching the world grow bored as the aliens fail to put on fireworks for the media by attacking or showing off. Instead they follow the human model and form gangs hassle cops deal with Nigerian drug dealers and -- yes -- plan an escape by covertly building weapons. Its the artillery that brings in Multi-National United (MNU) the private-interest group out to make a killing from learning how alien DNA can unleash firepower. Gruesome experiments are performed in secret labs and a plan is initiated to ship the aliens off to District 10 which is a concentration camp. Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copely) is the MNU agent in charge of the move to District 10. Wikus starts out as a dupe of his MNU father-in-law. But once infected by an alien virus that turns him into a prawn he learns hard lessons at the hands of MNU killer Koobus (a hissable David James). Their climactic faceoff is tremendously exciting. But the soul of the movie resides in Wikus relationship with two alien characters Christopher Johnson (the superb Jason Cope) and his son the computer-generated Little C.J. Its here that the film -- with reference points from Alien to Cloverfield -- grows into an intimate epic. Youll be wowed by Copley. His heart-rending tour de force deserves comparison to Jeff Goldblums in The Fly. And to me thats high praise. District 9 with a chump-change budget of 30 million soars on the imagination of its creators. This baby has the stuff to end the movie summer on a note of dazzle and distinction.

The allegorical allusions to ghettos and concentration camps the street signs reading ""No nonhuman loitering"" the callous degradation of an entire race It isnt hard to see what this talented South African director is getting at.But at a certain point in District 9 - with its frenetic jumble of mockumentary reports talking-head interviews and tag-along TV news-like footage - the story of a midlevel bureaucrat contaminated by an alien virus devolves into just another video-game shoot em up. Theres even a giant metallic exoskeleton robot thing - Transformers all over again.The havoc (and the film) begins when it is decided to relocate the stranded aliens derogatorily called ""prawns"" for their crustacean-like appearance to an area outside Johannesburg. Crime is rampant violence between humans and nonhumans is increasing and the solution arrived at is essentially to sweep the whole thing under the rug. Or more exactly to move the encampment of 1.8 million aliens out of town out of sight.And so a private contractor Multi-National United (MNU) - with its copters and armored vehicles billy clubs and machine guns - is brought in to facilitate the evictions. Enter Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley) a midlevel MNU field agent. Wikus comes off as a bumbler a bureaucrat only moderately intelligent but well-connected - hes married to the daughter of MNUs boss.At first the evictions go fairly smoothly. The aliens are confused and wary but theyre signing the forms grudgingly following orders. Its when Wikus discovers a shack full of beakers and chemistry-set gizmos - and opens a seemingly harmless canister (it looks like a coffee thermos) - that the trouble begins. Wikus starts to vomit black fluid. His fingernails flake off and his hand metamorphoses into a tentacled limb just like the aliens have.Theres not much to be said about the acting in District 9 - the humans run bark scream fight and cry and the nonhumans speak in subtitled radio-dial gobbledygook. What is absolutely impressive are the visual effects the hordes of aliens the mother ship the seamless blending of the real with the fantastic. Peter Jackson one of District 9s producers turned over his Weta Workshop facility in New Zealand for the weapons creatures and makeup effects.There is a lot of shield-your-eyes ickiness in District 9 a lot of violence and gore. What there is not a lot of however is humanity - even in the films depiction of the inhumanity humans are capable of.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Deceptive-advertising alert. ""District 9"" is positioned in ads and trailers as violent thrill-a-minute B-movie science fiction in which Earth-stranded aliens fight heavily armed security forces. And it is that. First-time writer/director Neill Blomkamp spatters the screen with blood explosions and disintegrating bodies. On that level it knocks ""Transformers"" for a loop. But socked in with the whiplash action and over-the-top gore is a story thats shockingly funny clever and emotionally resonant. ""District 9"" is that rarest kind of film magnificent trash. Blomkamp immerses us in a meticulously detailed world where thrills performance and story work in seamless harmony. Of all the various sci-fi dystopias -- societies that have gone mad -- ""District 9s"" is the most believable present-day Johannesburg South Africa. The film shot like a fly-on-the-wall documentary paints a harsh picture of the city. Riddled with crime violence and unemployment its now stressed by an influx of immigrants. We get the background on the newcomers from talking heads and news footage. For 20 years a huge spaceship has hovered silently over the city immobilized and out of fuel. Inside were tens of thousands of diseased malnourished aliens. The aliens -- crustaceans disparagingly called ""prawns"" -- are intelligent. They have a language that humans can understand and technology that humans havent mastered. But they have degenerated in captivity. They now live in a vast ghetto patrolled by mercenaries. They are filthy they breed like cockroaches they are violent when provoked and the city is plastered with no-trespassing ""Humans Only"" signs. In their concentrated poverty the refugees suck up benefits that could go to needy humans. Everyone resents the prawns. At least they provide employment for petty bureaucrats like Wikus (it rhymes with weakness) Van De Merwe. Wikus is a functionary at the corporation that runs the alien ghetto a job that suits him perfectly. Hes an obnoxious back-slapper who thanks to his influential father-in-law is charged with relocating the prawns from their shantytown to a distant prison camp. A typical film would make an idealistic scientist or daring soldier our guide into the aliens world. ""District 9"" which boldly undercuts conventions at every turn positions Wikus the small-time careerist as our antihero. Courtesy Of Tristar Pictures Star Tribune One of the crustacean aliens in ""District 9."" He leads a SWAT team carrying eviction notices; the totalitarian love for documentation requires every alien to make its ""scrawl"" on the dotted line. Behind one door Wikus and his crew find a hive of alien embryos which they torch. ""Hear those eggs popping? Just like popcorn"" he blurts with glee. Hes a poster boy for the banality of evil. But unlike the South African security thugs and African gangsters who shoot prawns at will hes redeemable. Newcomer Sharlto Copley is stunning in his first film role delivering a performance the equal of De Niro in his prime. Copley gives Wikus a pathos that somehow makes you pity him despite everything. You look at Wikus and recognize the worst parts of yourself. Any good drama requires its protagonist to travel an arc of growth that results in a changed worldview. What happens to Wikus transforms him from a rank specimen of inhumanity into a tragic character and ultimately a hero. Copley hits every note perfectly. ""District 9"" is a compelling apartheid allegory -- think ""Aliens"" meets ""Schindlers List"" -- but theres not a moment of preaching in it. This is first and foremost an electrifying ride. The effects are jaw-dropping and sometimes hilarious; theres nothing like seeing a soldier taken out by a flying pig. Not only are the interactions between aliens and humans entirely convincing but the computer-generated prawns can act The story repeatedly hints that there may be a sequel and Ill be at the head of the line for tickets. ""District 9"" is the dawn of the next big genre thing.

Share Tweet Smuggling a strong political allegory under the guise of a scrappy docu-style science fiction thriller Neill Blomkamps District 9 asks a simple question If an alien spacecraft stalled out over a major city stranding legions of starving and impoverished creatures how would humankind respond? Blomkamp who was born in Johannesburg South Africa under apartheid imagines a similar arrangement in the same city with insectoid ""others"" shuffled off into crime-riddled slums and controlled by a hideous private corporation more concerned with containment than compassion. In a world awash with anti-immigrant fervor it makes sense that the marvels of an alien race stranded on our faraway planet would be brushed aside to accommodate the fears of earthlings who dont want these ""prawns"" to be a drain on their jobs and resources. They dont even speak English Perhaps Blomkamps shrewdest conceit is to make a hapless paper-pusher the films hero Sharlto Copley plays a Michael ""heckuva job"" Brown-type whose well-connected father-in-law secured him a position well above his station at Multi-National United (MNU) the company responsible for alien affairs. After 20 years of keeping the aliens penned up in a shantytown ruled by Nigerian thugs MNU has decided to shift them to an equally miserable refugee camp further away from the city and puts Copley in charge of the operation. Things dont go well and they get worse when Copley inhales a foreign fluid that slowly and painfully transforms his body into an alien/human hybrid. That makes him a person of interest for the MNU because only alien parts can activate the prawns arsenal of powerful weapons. Shooting in the handheld style popularized by Paul Greengrass Bourne movies and faux-docs like Cloverfield Blomkamp gives District 9 a ground-level immediacy that amps up the intensity and mimics the feel of a developing TV news story. It also evokes the charming homemade aesthetic of producer Peter Jacksons early ""splat-stick"" comedies like Bad Taste and Dead/Alive a tack that helps scrape the gloss off the modest (though impressive) effects. Blomkamp doesnt give a full enough picture of human-alien relations and Copleys relationship with a prawn and its son edges into sentimentality but District 9 fuses science fiction mayhem and biting social commentary as well as any film since Starship Troopers. Its the rare alien invasion story that has the aliens running scared.

Email| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + The last time I felt the sort of outrageously kinetic action-movie high ""District 9"" delivers it was 1981 and George Miller Mel Gibson and ""Mad Max 2 The Road Warrior"" had just come roaring out of Australia.Like that film ""District 9"" is a scrappy day-after-tomorrow epic; like it too it was made off the Hollywood grid directed and co-written by the South African filmmaker Neill Blomkamp and shot in Johannesburg and the New Zealand studios of producer Peter Jackson. Its an outsider blockbuster a juicy bravura piece of moviemaking pulp and its hellacious style almost -- but not quite -- disguises its shortcomings as a story.There are no stars other than the concept. ""District 9"" asks us to imagine that a massive interstellar spaceship might show up one day and park itself over not New York or Washington D.C. but Joburg. The ships inhabitants are a click-clacking cross between humans insects and crustaceans; quickly dubbed ""prawns"" by wary earthlings theyre shunted off to the festering shantytown of the title. Twenty years pass during which crime and squalor soar in District 9 while humans outside practice a sort of alien apartheid.That metaphor stings and stings hard; if only the movie followed through on it. ""District 9"" is content to be a loud smart frenetic action movie with just a hint of interspecies bonding a la ""The Defiant Ones."" Wikus (Sharlto Copley) a high-level functionary with MNU Corp. is in charge of relocating the aliens to a concentration camp in the desert; a well-meaning wimp and smug anti-prawn racist hes also the son-in-law of the companys steely CEO (Louis Minnaar).During the evictions Wikus gets a face full of a mysterious liquid and -- well lets just say he starts to go through some heavy changes. Suddenly hes a man wanted by the government his company his companys secret experimental lab a strutting sadist of an army colonel (David James) and by the Nigerian crime boss (Eugene Khumbanyiwa) who runs District 9s black market economy and wants to shore up his mojo by eating a crucial part of Wikuss anatomy.The heros only ally turns out to be ""Christopher Johnson"" a towering alien who seems smarter than your average prawn and who in fact turns out to hold the key to the entire 20-year mystery. Christopher has a young son too -- a figure of adorable CGI insect resourcefulness -- but the movie doesnt exactly stop to smell the roses. Once ""District 9"" shifts into gear each sequence is a white-knuckle action set piece designed to top the one immediately preceding it. Bullets fly cars detonate the land-speed record for cursing is broken early and often. After a certain point Wikus discovers he has the rare human ability to control the aliens biotech weaponry and the movie really takes off the gloves.This is all visualized with wit verve and the narrow worldview of a very well-produced video game. (Blomkamp was originally supposed to make the big screen version of the hit game Halo; this film adapted from an earlier short is his consolation prize for losing the gig.) ""District 9"" is filmed from a confusing multiplicity of fictional sources -- we see the action via security cameras cable-news footage a MNU corporate documentary and Blomkamps own omniscient narrative eye. None of these sits still for a second; if you have trouble with ""Bourne Identity"" shaky-cam syndrome be aware that all of ""District 9"" has been filmed in seizure-cam.Its an affectation that wears out its welcome as do other aspects of the movie (the coincidences that bring Wikus and Christopher together not once but twice or the mysterious liquid that serves whatever purpose the screenplay needs at any given moment). Theres ultimately less to ""District 9"" than meets the eye even if an awful lot meets the eye. The details more than anything are what stick with you the mothership that hangs over the city like an immense abandoned car the aliens addiction to canned cat food the way the film co-opts the language of one of the 20th centurys most virulently racist forms of government.To what end though? That there was actually a District 6 in Cape Town that served the same function for human beings as this movies District 9 does for computer-generated shrimp is a tragedy Blomkamp doesnt get remotely close to. Despite the bad-boy brainiac production values and the films relentless pace theres no poetry to ""District 9"" -- no vision behind the vision -- until the very final shot. That last image is haunting certainly and it makes me want to see what this filmmaker does next but its also too little too late. (c) Copyright 2009 Globe Newspaper Company.

Tolkien Movies Science Fiction and Fantasy Entertainment News TriStar Pictures/David BloomerDavid James (left) and director Neill Blomkamp on the set of ""District 9.""Neill Blomkamp wont turn 30 until next month but hes such a bright and likable guy its tough to hold his success against him. At an age when lots of aspiring filmmakers are maxing out their friends platinum cards or banging out screenplays in North Hollywood studio apartments Blomkamp came under the mother-hen protection -- and considerable financial clout -- of ""Lord of the Rings"" impresario Peter Jackson.Jackson and Blomkamp spent several years trying to put together a film version of the Microsoft video game Halo (Blomkamp actually made three digital shorts to promote a 2007 game release). When financing for that fanboy wet dream finally fell apart Blomkamp began working on a long-percolating idea Take an archetypal science-fiction story -- in this case the story of humans first contact with extraterrestrial aliens -- and set it against the explosive social realities of contemporary Johannesburg South Africa his hometown. (Blomkamps family emigrated to Canada in the late 90s.)Amid the late-summer doldrums of studio leftovers Blomkamps resulting feature-film debut ""District 9"" stands out as the science-fiction film of the year. (Thats with all due respect to J.J. Abrams enjoyable exercise in ""Star Trek"" meta-nostalgia.) Consider the fact that it was shot in South Africa without recognizable acting talent on a budget that wouldnt furnish Michael Bays assistants trailer and it might be the sci-fi surprise of this entire decade. Blomkamp cut his teeth in the entertainment industry doing digital effects for such TV series as ""Stargate SG-1 and ""Smallville"" and yes theres ample technical wizardry on display. But ""District 9"" thankfully is a lot more than kickass digital fight scenes. Its a grimy consistently surprising and fundamentally human-centric science-fiction yarn reminiscent of the dystopian semi-realistic 1970s tradition.Furthermore its a movie in which a star is born Sharlto Copley a friend of Blomkamps from their teen years in Johannesburg gives an amazing tragicomic performance as a mustachioed second-rate Afrikaner bureaucrat named Wikus van der Merwe who becomes -- well let me stop myself right there. I feel the hot stinky breath of the spoiler police so lets just explain that Wikus is employed by MNU a shadowy private corporation hired by the South African government to manage the increasingly unruly Johannesburg townships where a million or more insectoid aliens have been contained since their spaceship mysteriously beached itself above the city 30 years earlier.Wikus MNU overlord who just happens to also be his father-in-law has appointed him to move the increasingly undesirable and violent interlopers out of Johannesburg and into a not-so-glorified concentration camp many miles outside the city. Unsurprisingly the removal project goes terribly awry -- and at least some of the aliens secrets are revealed -- but along the way Wikus morphs from a smug callous sycophantic moron into one of the more unlikely motion-picture protagonists youll ever see.Both as cinema and as storytelling ""District 9 capitalizes on the uncertain boundaries between fiction and reality that characterize contemporary media and for that matter the whole contemporary world. Blomkamp insists hes got no specific allegorical ironic or didactic message to deliver but one might describe the movie as overloaded with potential metaphorical meaning. Its presented as a propagandistic TV documentary about what went wrong in District 9 where Wikus -- a white representative of a black government -- went in with heavy military backup to uproot the one group in South African history to be treated worse than blacks were under the previous apartheid regime.Theres even some footage Blomkamp shot documentary-style on the streets of Johannesburg where he walked around asking residents of various races how they would feel if aliens were settled in their overstressed socially divided crime-ridden city. As Blomkamp explained when I met him at the New York offices of Sony Pictures Johannesburg -- depicted in the bleak dry South African winter as an oppressive wasteland of shantytowns fast food outlets walled luxury compounds and grim government fortresses -- is both the films main character and its reason for existing in the first place. Neill here you are with your debut feature film coming out and its produced by Peter Jackson. Its kind of an amazing situation for a first-time director. Yeah Im aware of how lucky Ive been. Im in a very good position. Are you also OK with the fact that -- Im guessing here -- maybe 30 percent of the opening-night audience is going to think that Peter actually directed the movie? Yeah I think so. I mean thats fine. As long as the film is good and Ive done what Ive wanted to do then Hollywood is going to be open to me making more films. Theres no question that Petes name is going to draw more people to the film and thats completely acceptable. It shines a spotlight on the whole movie. You have this fascinating premise where were thrown into this world in which aliens have lived on Earth for 20 or 30 years and they just happen to be confined to the Johannesburg townships in a situation very reminiscent of apartheid. Talk about how your background growing up in that time and place influenced this story. Well I think theres no question that the movie is a condensation of all the elements in Joburg that had an effect on me when I was growing up. Which means it couldnt have been set anywhere else. In my mind the film doesnt exist other than in Joburg. It was like Johannesburg first and ""District 9 grew out of that. There are many different levels you can break it down into. From a photographic standpoint there was what I wanted to convey about Johannesburg which is that its almost this burnt nuclear wasteland at least in winter. It really is like that.Then theres this constant sense of an urban prison with razor wire and electric fences and armed guards everywhere. Its a very oppressive-feeling city. I wanted to capture the essence of that and I thought it was really cool to put science fiction in that environment. I wanted to see science fiction in that city. I mean I lived there and you dont come across cities like that much especially not in the First World. They dont exist.So that was the primary reason for making ""District 9."" No allegories no metaphors nothing. Just science fiction in Joburg. Then as the idea began to unfold I started to realize that actually this includes all the topics that have formed my outlook on the whole world. My upbringing in that city had a massive effect on me and I started to realize that everything to do with segregation and apartheid and now the new xenophobic stuff thats happening in the city all of that dominates my mind quite a lot of the time. Then theres the fact that science fiction is the other big part of my mind and I started to realize that the two fit well together. Theres no message per se that Im trying to get across with the movie. Its rather that I want to present science fiction and put it in the environment that affected me. In the process maybe I highlight all the topics that interest me but Im not giving any answers. You can take from it what you will. You Might Also Like Now you left South Africa when you were a teenager right? Yeah I was around 18 when we moved to Vancouver. It was 10 years ago or a little more than that. So does this story take place in contemporary South Africa or further back closer to the apartheid era? Its the present. Its totally the present. Ive gone back every year so its not like I went back a decade later and was shocked by the changes. Ive watched the citys gradual changes. Its more like this is an alternate reality of contemporary Joburg. In my mind a black government is in control and I assume that the white government -- with apartheid ending in 1994 -- did the same thing to the aliens. Given your background in digital effects and advertising people may expect a film that is highly technical dominated by CGI and explosions. Now youve got all that stuff but the basis of the film is really a remarkable human character. You get this terrific performance from Sharlto Copley who I guess has been your collaborator all along. I would say hes been more my friend than my collaborator. He was interested in similar things and hes a few years older than me. When I was coming into high school he was leaving high school. He was closer to the film industry in South Africa than I was and Ive wanted to be in film since I was like zero. So when I moved to Canada we stayed in touch just because we were friends and we were interested in the same stuff.But Sharlto is also like Sacha Baron Cohen -- hell just totally relentlessly fuck with you. So I knew that if I was trying to create this realistic character based on a lot of improv he would be a really really good person for that even though hes done no acting. Hes never acted before? Thats pretty amazing. Hes done a few Borat-style shows where hes just gone out and messed with people but he hasnt actually done acting. This was a complete first for him. I filmed some test footage and showed it to Pete and Pete said ""Clearly hes very talented"" and signed off on casting him in the film and here we are. Sharlto plays this guy Wikus this Afrikaner bureaucrat who seems at first like kind of an imbecile. Oh he is an imbecile. [Laughter.] He is totally out of his depth. He has been assigned to move the alien population from one ghetto to another basically. Or to put it more honestly from a ghetto to a concentration camp. And it all goes wrong. Yeah it goes horribly wrong. Wikus is someone who is like an indirect racist I suppose. His indirect oppression of the aliens through being a company yes man along with 50000 other employees -- agreeing with everything his company does and never questioning it -- has resulted in their current situation in Johannesburg. Hes comfortable with that kind of oppression he even makes jokes about the conditions the aliens live in. Then an event happens in the film that catapults him down a path that ultimately leads him away from his peers his friends and family. He finds himself dealing with what the aliens have been dealing with for the last 30 years and becomes a complete outcast. The question becomes what hes going to do to rectify things or get himself back where he was before and thats where the compelling human element of the story comes from. Theres a very dark comic side to this story in which blacks and whites come together to treat another group worse than blacks were ever treated under apartheid. I was pretty aware of that. I thought that was a pretty funny concept. Another part of recent South African history that isnt world news is that the collapse of Zimbabwe has introduced millions of illegal Zimbabwean immigrants into South African cities. So you have impoverished South African blacks hoping for a better life in their own country faced with an influx of millions of impoverished Zimbabweans who have come to South Africa to build a new life for their families. Now you have this powder-keg situation with black against black which is highly bizarre.When we started filming the movie we had this terrible situation where we woke up one morning to find out that Johannesburg was eating itself alive. Impoverished South Africans had started murdering impoverished Zimbabweans necklacing them and burning them and chopping them up. Thats a very serious piece of contemporary South African society that also finds its way into the film some impoverished citizens wanting other impoverished citizens out. Theres an ingredient here that will definitely push some peoples buttons. Im talking about the way you depict these really scary Nigerian crime lords who are running things in the townships. Theyre violent and brutal theyre obsessed with voodoo and magic. You know these images are pretty uncomfortable especially for Americans who tend to be so careful in public discussions of race Heres a white guy from South Africa making a movie with scary murderous black African villains. Sure Im totally aware of that. I know those buttons are going to be pushed. Unfortunately thats the reality of it and it doesnt matter how politically correct or politically incorrect you are. The bottom line is that there are huge Nigerian crime syndicates in Johannesburg. I wanted the film to feel real to feel grounded and I was going to incorporate as much of contemporary South Africa as I wanted to and thats just how it is. Youre too young to have seen movies from the 70s the first time around but I was really reminded of the gritty social-realist sci-fi parables we used to see back then. ""Soylent Green"" for example or the first few ""Planet of the Apes"" films. Yeah ""Soylent Green"" is really great. ""Soylent Green"" and ""Silent Running."" Yeah totally I love those. My actual real favorites though are not the films about contemporary society but more the ones about human psychology ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"" ""Blade Runner"" ""2001."" But I mean the entire spectrum of science fiction -- Im a fan of all of it. Im just happy participating in that environment. Its all I want to do. ""District 9 opens Aug. 14 nationwide.

"District 9 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; district-9 ) District 9 (New Zealand 2009) August 12 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli It is universally acknowledged (at least by those who dont play with Transformers toys) that the best science fiction stories are those that use the devices of aliens robots and space ships to illustrate some greater truth. Star Trek (the TV series in its various incarnations and to a lesser degree the movies) understood this and thats one reason it has become revered in some circles despite frequent lapses into dubious science. District 9 the eye-opening feature debut from South African filmmaker Neill Blomkamp recognizes this as well and in order to avoid the possibility of his message being overlooked he abandons subtlety. Anyone who watches District 9 and doesnt think of Apartheid Nazis and Josef Mengele needs to spend some time reading a few history books. The premise is not unique for a science fiction movie although the direction in which Blomkamp takes it is. A giant spaceship has arrived at Earth and after bypassing cities like New York and Chicago it comes to hover over Johannesburg South Africa. It hangs there in mid-air motionless until an expedition from Earth arrives and cuts its way into the ship. Inside the humans find millions of alien worker drones sick and malnourished and a massive operation is begun to transport the aliens from their ship to the ground feed them and give them a new ""home."" Unfortunately good intentions are not enough and the alien habitat District 9 becomes more of a concentration camp than a refuge. Things start really going wrong when the decision is made to transfer the aliens from their current residence to a smaller more remote location. Wilkus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley) is not competent to handle the operation of which he is in charge and his lack of experience is quickly evident. His first day in this position ends with him in the hospital having been contaminated by an alien fluid - and thats where his personal nightmare begins. The film has been assembled in a part-documentary part you-are-there style although without the potential nausea-inducing camerawork that marred Cloverfield for many viewers. Parts of District 9 are black-and-white and even when things are in color the hues have been drained and washed out. All of this works to provide a gritty look and amp up the level of believability. The special effects which include everything from shots of the mothership hovering over Johannesburg to blasts from various weapons to the CGI rendering of the creatures are first-rate. The film recalls the likes of The Day the Earth Stood Still David Cronenbergs The Fly and Independence Day. Absent are the high-minded ideals evident in more optimistic productions such as E.T. Close Encounters and Star Trek First Contact. Here the premise is simple the humanitarian impulses that lead to the planet welcoming the aliens are quickly overridden by greed and xenophobia. Some try to profit from the newcomers while others ruled by fear want to destroy them. Some might argue that Blomkamps perspective is bleak and cynical but a cursory glimpse at the whole of recorded history validates his position. The occasional offbeat humor in District 9 is needed - the material is so bleak that without it this would be a tough 112 minutes to endure. There are also plenty of action sequences and unlike in Transformers Revenge of the Fallen they are expertly choreographed easy to follow and generate a sense of tension and excitement. (And yes the biggest and best of the action sequences involves a giant robot-like creature.) The film accomplishes a rare thing its a science fiction story with depth and thought-provoking ideas that still has room for shoot-outs explosions and bloody violence. The R-rating is well earned - more than one person after being hit by an energy weapon explodes in a shower of blood and Wikus Fly-like transformation is just as gruesome as when something similar happened to Jeff Goldblum. One of the most intriguing aspects of District 9 is the way Blomkamp re-aligns our sympathies. In the beginning aided by the documentary re-cap of the aliens arrival on Earth we are neutral observers naturally prone to side with humanity. As the story unfolds however and we are privy to the atrocities committed inside District 9 and the inhumane manner in which the ""prawns"" (as they are derisively called because of a crustacean-like appearance) are treated our thinking changes. By the end mankind is the enemy and the average viewer wouldnt be saddened if a potential sequel opened in much the same manner as Independence Day. As you sow so shall you reap... District 9 expands upon the ideas explored in Blomkamps 2005 short ""Alive in Joburg"" (which one assumes will be included on the DVD). Peter Jackson produced the movie adding an internationally revered name to the credits that will doubtless help in marketing. (Jackson had originally intended for Blomkamp to direct the movie adaptation of Halo but when that deal fell apart District 9 became Plan B.) However although Jacksons moniker may help to get warm bodies into theater seats the Lord of the Rings director is not needed to keep them there. Nor is the lack of an established actor (Sharlto Copley the lead and only human with significant screen time acquits himself admirably but is an unkown) a drawback. District 9 speaks with a loud clear voice and by defying as many science fiction conventions as it embraces it becomes a singular movie-going experience. For fans of the genre the summer of 2009 truly has been the best of times and the worst of times. Sure there have been the likes of Transformers 2 and G.I. Joe but this has also been the season of Moon and now District 9. District 9 ends in a way that is both satisfying and unsettling. Although the story is told there are untilled ground and unanswered questions - not the least of which is what will happen in three years. A sequel if one is warranted is effectively set up but is not mandatory. The strongest afterimage left by the film is the one provided by gazing through the dark lens of District 9 at human nature. I for one hope the inhabitants of Earth never encounter visitors from another planet because the reality of how we might interact with them could be close to what is depicted here and thats a depressing thought.

And thats exactly the point of this great mind-stretcher of a sci-fi actioner -- surely the first flying-saucer-and-mayhem movie in which aliens touch down on Earth by way of Johannesburg rather than a more glamorous port of call. Its no accident that the aliens massive spacecraft stalls out over South Africa uniting the citizenry (with its own ? infamous history of us-against-them racism) against a population humans of every color can despise. South African-born director Neill Blomkamp knows the history of his homeland. The political resonance is sharp. But the movie wears its allegorical flourishes lightly. ?A thinking persons sci-fi movie from an inventive director of shorts and TV commercials District 9 revels in the fun of mashing up? narrative styles with much of the footage presented as if shot by a documentary team on the scene. (Cloverfield made merry with the same verite conceit.) The action -- and theres plenty -- really takes off when a big corporation (any resemblance to Halliburton is...your call) is hired to move the creatures from the slumlike township in which they have been segregated to something like a concentration camp something meaner and farther away. Not in my backyard cry the good people of Joburg about the crustacean-shaped species derogatorily called Prawns. A rule-bound company man named Wikus (played by Sharlto Copley in a killer feature-acting debut) is ?selected to implement the massive relocation. Understandably nothing runs smoothly -- especially once Wikus starts poking around the shanty home of a Prawn whos a good dad to his shrimp of a kid -- and it turns out a powerful scientist with a homegrown workshop. Viva the Prawn revolution What begins with ""news"" footage out of South Africa ends with headline news here at home District 9 proves that theres intelligent alien life in the movie universe this summer.

District 9 Fair Director Neill Blomkamp. Cast Sharlto Copley Jason Cope. Rating R for bloody violence and pervasive language. Related A directors tale of District 9 Invasion of the alien movies Sci-fi movies And not in a cute way as in the upcoming ""Planet 51"" - with an animated Dwayne Johnson scaring the bejeezus out of little green men - but in exactly the ways that humans can become monsters in the real world. Director and co-writer Neill Blomkamp is South African and his film is a Third World version of science fiction squalid oppressive and grim. It tells in faux-documentary style how a vast spaceship was stranded in the sky above Johannesburg 30 years ago. Its starving passengers - a million green hideously tentacled creatures disparagingly called ""prawns"" - now live in a sprawling shantytown rummaging through garbage for scraps of food. The locals loathe them but arent above taking advantage of their desperation. The main human character is hardly heroic. Wikus van de Merwe (Sharlto Copley) is an affable but feckless executive with Multi-National United the militaristic corporation hired to contain the aliens (and which is secretly conducting experiments on them to uncover the workings of their biotechnology). Leading an operation to relocate the creatures to a new camp Wikus is exposed to a biological agent that begins to change his DNA. Hes about to know what its like to be an outsider in an unforgiving world. In many ways ""District 9"" is a refreshing subversion of the usual sci-fi tropes. Its relentless portrayal of human viciousness will be off-putting to many moviegoers raised on Hollywoods sanitized extravaganzas but it reflects reality honestly. And for action fans the creature effects and climactic shoot-em-up will be worth the price of admission. But this could have been a much better film than it is. The biggest problem is the documentary conceit. The bureaucratic interviews amount to long minutes of unnecessary narration that bogs down the pace and the endless array of ""source materials"" - cutting away to security-camera footage for example - merely serves to remind you that youre watching a movie. To make matters worse Blomkamp doesnt carry the documentary style through the entire film but wanders away from it to show the aliens point of view or for extended action sequences. A much more sparing use of this device would have made for a more compelling film. As it is ""District 9"" feels about 40 minutes longer than it actually is. On the other hand a film thats provocative but flawed is a lot more interesting than a perfectly made piece of junk. For science-fiction fans looking for a bit more brainpower than ""Transformers"" has to offer ""District 9"" points the way toward redemption for a movie genre that could use an infusion of artistic ambition.

The mysterious and alarming signs have been out there for weeks months even On billboards benches and bus stops featuring crude cartoon alien drawings theyve warned us of non-humans theyve urged us to remain separate. ""What is all that about?"" youve probably wondered. Well theyre ads for the enormously buzzed-about ""District 9"" and thankfully given their ubiquity all the hype is justified. This is one intense intelligent well-crafted action movie one that dazzles the eye with seamless special effects but also makes you think without preaching. Like the excellent ""Moon"" from earlier this summer ""District 9"" has the aesthetic trappings of science fiction but its really more of a character drama an examination of how a man responds when hes forced to confront his identity during extraordinary circumstances. Aliens who arrived here in their spaceship more than 20 years ago have now been quarantined in cramped and dangerous slums; the nerdy bureaucrat charged with moving them to new quarters (the tremendous Sharlto Copley) undergoes a physical and emotional transformation in the process. Whats amazing is that this visceral yet philosophically sophisticated film is the first feature from commercial and music-video director Neill Blomkamp who co-wrote the script with Terri Tatchell. (Peter Jackson is the big name attached to this refreshingly star-free project hes one of the producers and Weta Digital the company behind Jacksons ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy provided the intricate alien effects.) Blomkamp set ""District 9"" in Johannesburg South Africa where he was born and raised so its easy to assume his themes of racial division are a metaphor for apartheid. You could interpret it that way but its quick bursts of violence and urban warfare also feel like a statement on the war in Iraq; a private corporation tasked with keeping aliens away from humans is reminiscent of Blackwater. Using his own short film ""Alive in Joburg"" as a leaping-off point Blomkamp creates a sensation of relevance and immediacy by combining fake news footage real TV clips and documentary-style hand-held camerawork. Meanwhile the fantastic sight of a spaceship hovering over Johannesburg trapped and unable to return home its former inhabitants scurrying about on the ground in squalor creates an ominous and steady source of tension. But he also builds suspense early on with a flurry of talking-head interviews from experts and insiders all foreshadowing that something horrible has happened in the slum known as District 9 and that Copleys character Wikus van der Merwe was at the center of it. ""The entire world was looking at Johannesburg so we had to do the right thing"" says one. ""Nobody saw it coming at all"" says another. Wikus seems a rather ordinary sort in his own on-camera interviews sunny jumpy a bit like Ricky Gervais character David Brent on the British version of ""The Office."" He lives in a nondescript suburban house with his wife; his father-in-law is his boss. Everything seems to be in order. But whats fascinating is watching his true nature emerge as he interacts with the aliens once he enters their camp and tries to evict them. He becomes slick conniving almost cruel. And whats even more riveting is the way his dramatic exposure to these creatures known pejoratively as ""prawns"" for their antenna and hard shells doesnt necessarily make him a better person all of a sudden. There is so much more to say from this point but doing so would ruin the many twists and revelations in store. Well just say that Wikus adapts he learns how to survive in a place where there are no easy answers.

Joe (a movie that I saw unfortunately--I truly wish with all my heart I could somehow go back in time and get those two hours of my life back). District 9 was made on a relatively lean budget (30 million) with no well-known actors and a 29-year-old director named Neill Blomkamp (who? Exactly.) And yet District 9 is the most exciting science fiction movie to come along in ages; definitely the most thrilling film of the summer; and quite possibly the best film Ive seen all year. It opens with a faux-documentary spiel which has gotten to be a rather tiring trope in other movies but in this particular case provides some fairly helpful background information More than 20 years earlier an alien spaceship sputtered to a stop seemingly out of gas over Johannesburg. Upon forcing their way onto the ship some intrepid earthlings discovered that the aliens over a million of them were terribly malnourished; they were then carted away to refugee camps while the world argued over what to do. Unsurprisingly tensions increased over the next couple of decades as the aliens (derisively called ""Prawns"" and they do in fact look like tall and lanky shrimp) started to multiply and chafe with their human neighbors. The aliens slum District 9 is dusty and crime-ridden and once their insatiable love of cat food is discovered (is this an Alf shout-out?) various scams and trades and violence follow. A private company called MNU (Multi-National United) is contracted to relocate the aliens from District 9 to a new camp outside the city limits. Of course MNU is secretly interested in figuring out a way to use the sophisticated alien weaponry which apparently can only be activated using alien DNA. Still with us? All of these facts are established with breathtaking precision and speed at the onset of the film. There is no time to say Wait there are aliens from outer space in South Africa?--you just have to go with it (and youll be surprised at how quickly your brain adjusts to this reality). Enter Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley) a twitchy pencil-pusher who is put in charge of the evictions helped by the fact that his father-in-law is a big cheese wat MNU. He stumbles upon a foreign object in the course of serving notice inhales it and quickly contracts an alien virus that begins to change his DNA starting with a slimy claw instead of a hand. And then things really begin to get crazy Wikus is forced to go on the run suddenly the most valued human alive as the only one able to operate the alien weapons; hes hunted by MNU and by the Nigerian thugs who have set up shop in District 9 where he must try and hide. This film really has everything thrills gross-outs (teeth and nails falling out ack) amazing special effects a love story xenophobia with the shadow of apartheid looming like that stalled spaceship. Mr. Copley is terrific as he evolves in body and spirit--as he becomes more and more Prawn-like in looks his humanity grows stronger. Peter Jackson who ""presents"" District 9 and served as producer is responsible for giving Mr. Blomkamp (who came up with the original story) the chance to make this film and Im guessing the risk will prove to be a prescient one. I cant wait to see what hell come up with next (heres hoping for a District 10). svilkomersonobserver.com Comment Filed under District 9 Jason Cope movie Movie Review Nathalie Boltt Sharlto Copley Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture No Alarms No Surprises Why Buying Concert Tickets Is a Rigged System Culture The Man Who Made Blue Oyster Cult RIP Producer Sandy Pearlman Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP",http://www.observer.com/2009/movies/district-9-blew-my-mind,200,district939,district9,observer

A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - The aliens have been with us for 20 years already at the start of South African director Neill Blomkamps fast and furiously inventive District 9 their huddled masses long ago extracted from their broken-down mothership and deposited in the titular housing slum on the outskirts of Johannesburg. Unlike the space invaders of most science fiction these six-foot-tall E.T.s (pejoratively nicknamed ""prawns"" but more closely resembling the love child of a cockroach and the Creature From the Black Lagoon) come neither in peace nor in malice. They are we are told the worker bees of whatever galaxy they hail from accustomed to following orders rather than giving them. And so they find themselves dazed and confused in their new home while their flying saucer still hovers inertly over the skyline as if waiting for a jump-start from an intergalactic AAA.A high-end commercials director making his feature debut Blomkamp (who also co-wrote the script with Terri Tatchell) milks his ostensibly fantastic scenario for all its allegorical worth. With its corrugated tin sheds and abject poverty District 9 stands in for the township settlements where more than a million South African blacks still live without basic human services two decades after the end of apartheid. But you dont have to squint too hard to also see the itinerant community as an all-purpose analog for the ghettos of Nazi Germany Americas inner cities and all of those other places where unwanted powerless peoples have been herded off far from the backyards of the ruling class. Blomkamps touch however is anything but heavy and for most of its run time District 9 whizzes by with a resourcefulness and mordant wit nearly worthy of its obvious influences Invasion of the Body Snatchers Dawn of the Dead and Starship Troopers.As the movie begins a wave of violent prawn unrest--not unlike the one that rocked South Africas real townships only last month--has prompted the good people of Joburg to crave even greater distance from their sub-human neighbors and a forced relocation of all alien residents to a Guantanamo-style tent city known as District 10 has become law. Enter Multi-National United a smarmy private military contractor that places the relocation in the hands of one Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley) a not very bright corporate lackey who also happens to be married to the bosss daughter. While MNU tries to decipher the aliens advanced weapons technology (leading to one disturbing scene set in a research lab that Dr. Mengele would have loved) affable but clueless Wikus yearns to surmount claims of nepotism. Then everything goes haywire with the oppressor getting a crash course in what it feels like to be the oppressed.District 9 is never better than in its first 45 minutes as Blomkamp maps out the films social and economic realities via a grab bag of news reports corporate videos and CCTV cameras. The aliens we learn can understand English but speak in their own indigenous language of guttural grunts and clicks (making this one of two major releases this month along with Quentin Tarantinos Inglourious Basterds to predominantly feature subtitled dialogue). Meanwhile inside the boundaries of District 9 itself a cadre of Nigerian gangsters exploit the prawns by charging them exorbitant prices for black-market goods (including the canned cat food the aliens regard as a culinary delicacy). Eventually Blomkamp adds some straight dramatic scenes to the mix around the point that the movie itself evolves into a somewhat more straightforward pursuit thriller--albeit one in which Wikus is both Dr. Richard Kimble and the one-armed man. Taking refuge in the very community he is supposed to be uprooting the middle manager finds himself forming a tentative alliance with a science-geek prawn known by the anglicized name of Christopher Johnson (played by actor Jason Cope with the aid of a few CGI enhancements) who may be his peoples only hope for a better life and who turns out to be the most humane compassionate character in the District 9 landscape.Even in the movies most conventional stretches Blomkamp puts things across with terrific verve using action and computer effects to enhance rather than trump story and character. District 9 was produced with help from The Lord of the Rings honcho Peter Jackson for all of 30 million (about the average advertising budget on a standard Hollywood production) after plans for Jackson and Blomkamp to collaborate on a much larger-scale adaptation of the Halo video-game franchise fell apart and the entire project seems carried along by the scrappy energy of a bright young filmmaker working far away from Hollywoods prying homogenizing eyes. Probably only with an advocate like Jackson to run interference for him could Blomkamp have gotten away with a lot of it--the Johannesburg setting (arent alien invasions only supposed to happen in New York L.A. or D.C.?) the dweeby hero the thick South African accents the subtitles. I cant wait to see what Blomkamp does next and I very much hope he gets even less money to do it.

Upon the ashes of his aborted ""Halo"" vidgame adaptation producer Peter Jackson has erected ""District 9"" an enjoyably disgusting sci-fier set in and around a rubble-strewn war zone where extraterrestrial refugees have taken up indefinite residence. Better conceived and executed than one might expect from a low-budget rebound project this grossly engrossing speculative fiction bears Jacksons blood-splattered fingerprints but also heralds first-time feature director Neill Blomkamp as a nimble talent to watch. A viral campaign reminiscent of the more gimmicky ""Cloverfield"" should draw hefty hordes initially but positive notices and buzz will be required to sustain a B.O. invasion. Shot and set in Blomkamps native South Africa ""District 9"" imagines a present-day scenario in which humans and aliens are forced into an uneasy co-existence and predictably bring out the violent worst in each other. As scripted by Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell the result reps a remarkably cohesive hybrid of creature feature and satirical mockumentary that elaborates on the helmers 2005 short ""Alive in Joburg"" borrows plot points from 1988s ""Alien Nation"" and takes its emotional cues from ""E.T."" The films faux-verite visual style however is very much a thing of the present blending handheld HD camerawork with ersatz news coverage (complete with CNN-style text scrolls) and talking heads plus actual archival footage from local news agencies so as to suggest an urgent dispatch from the front lines of an interspecies war. The introductory 15 minutes are swiftly paced making modest demands on the viewer to keep up with the jiggly aesthetic and the particulars of the premise Twenty years ago an enormous spaceship came to rest over Johannesburg now a sun-scorched urban wasteland. Since then the ships inhabitants referred to as ""prawns"" -- four-legged insectoid beings that walk upright secrete black goo and speak in subtitled grunts and gurgles -- have been moved into the titular ghetto and placed under the control of Multi-National United a private corporation bent on cracking the secrets of the aliens ultra-powerful weapons. Into the fray strides Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley) an annoyingly chipper boastful MNU operative overseeing the transfer of aliens to the more remote District 10. Blithely navigating cameramen through the creatures filthy shack homes Wikus accidentally comes into contact with an icky substance that within hours begins altering his DNA. In the scripts most ingenious gambit the contaminated Wikus is suddenly coveted by MNU as well as by a gang of Nigerian thugs and witch doctors who wont win the filmmakers any prizes for ethnic sensitivity. Forced into hiding Wikus teams up with an intelligent green-skinned prawn Christopher Johnson (voiced by Jason Cope) and his kid Little CJ whos kinda cute in a hideous sort of way; together they seek a way to reverse Wikus alien metamorphosis and help the refugees return to their planet. Rather than plunge the viewer immediately into unrelieved carnage and chaos the film opens on a note of anxious uncertainty and tense humor as it probes the varying degrees of hostility in human-prawn relations. Though compelling throughout ""District 9"" never becomes outright terrifying largely because Blomkamp is less interested in exploiting his aliens for cheap scares than in holding up a mirror to our own bloodthirsty xenophobic species. That said he doesnt skimp on the viscera; its hard to watch the grisly climactic battle with its parade of high-tech weaponry and exploding body parts and not think of the horror cheapies Jackson was making pre-""Lord of the Rings."" The pic does take a sentimental turn toward the end with an excess of alien reaction shots that feel at odds with the much more authentic passion Blomkamp lovingly invests in his grotesque setpieces. Copley makes the most of the only substantial human role -- and not an especially likable one at that -- with a twitchy blustery shifty-eyed performance of ferretlike intensity. Dropping F-bombs in Afrikaans-accented English he ably conveys not only Wikus physical transformation but also his mental deterioration and subsequent moral awakening; its to the pics credit that when Wikus is shown on the battlefield his half-mutated body covered with festering wounds and alien protrusions he has never seemed more profoundly human. Lensed primarily on the Red-One camera the film looks and sounds terrific its seeming improvisation masking the obviously exhaustive planning required in all departments. The interactions between the aliens (a combo of f/x and old-fashioned prosthetics) and the humans are handled as confidently as anything in the ""Transformers"" movies and are arguably more impressive for d.p. Trent Opalochs off-the-cuff shooting style. Clinton Shorters percussive score is effective but at times over-reliant on the loud wailing/crooning that has become a too-easy signifier of Africa and other foreign locales.
