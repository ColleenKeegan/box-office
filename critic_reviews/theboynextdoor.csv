Following the departure of her cheating husband (John Corbett) schoolteacher Claire (Lopez) should be throwing herself into work. Instead she throws herself into the well-toned arms of neighbouring hunk Noah (Ryan Guzman) the kind of all-American kid who likes to quote Homer shoot oranges off a log with automatic weapons and slowly peel off his tank top in front of open windows. But when Claire opts not to go back for seconds Noahs inner psycho is unsurprisingly revealed leading to the sort of wall-punching brakeline-snipping watch-you-while-you-sleep stalker shenanigans that were all the rage back in the early 90s. Props to director Rob Cohen for making a gender-flipped Fatal Attraction. But The Boy Next Door really should be a lot juicier - its only in the closing moments that the film finally cuts loose going out with the kind of gory goofy over-the-top bang that will win it fans among the so-bad-its-good crowd.

To be fair Im not at all ashamed to say that I absolutely love a good schlocky 90s esque thriller which Im guessing is exactly what director Rob Cohen was going for here. As the man at the helm of films such as XXX and The Fast amp; the Furious hes no stranger to the concept of smash-bang-wallop action high-kicking vaguely-intelligently-written dialogue into touch but still this could have been much better than it was. As well as defending dubious movie choices Ill also hold my hands up and say I dont think J-Lo is anywhere near as bad as people seem to think she is - come on convince me you didnt love Sunday afternoon guilty pleasure The Wedding Planner or shout encouragement at the screen as she single-handedly empowered her way to freedom in Enough? Here though poor Jenny from the Block simply isnt given anything to work with. An absolutely appalling script that I genuinely think I could have written on my 8 minute tube commute is beyond dreadful - my boyfriend was both baffled amp; somewhat scared as I kept muttering the lines that I knew were coming 10 seconds before they were spouted on screen. As a freshly separated teacher Jennifers Claire Peterson is trying to juggle work her teenage son and a difficult relationship with her estranged amp; cheating husband (played by a woefully under-used John Corbett) when hunky beefcake orphan Noah Sandborn moves in next door. What follows is a colour-by-numbers seduction and violent aftermath as she attempts to convince him that this is not a relationship headed for a happy ever after. Ryan Guzmans Noah is an absolute car-crash to watch his acting skills matched only by the afore-mentioned toe curling script and an apparent belief that a six pack is going to take him into the realms of thespian lore. The eternally amp; squeakily fabulous Kristin Chenoweth is so wasted as Claires friend Vicky that you think the only feeling she must have had during the last few scenes of the film was utter relief that it was over. Word of warning the dialogue is not only amateurishly predictable and unintentionally hilarious it also has some wholly un-necessary words thrown in for nothing other than shock value and the seduction scene is NSFWWP...Not Suitable For Watching With Parents. Is it the worst film ever made? Well no not in a world where Pitch Black and Starship Troopers exist it isnt but make no mistake this is not a film to watch if youre after even the vaguest whisper of cerebral challenge. This is a hangover film a jet lag film a too-sick-to-reach-for-the-remote film and while it wont rock your world itll pass 90 minutes of your time in an affably awful enough way.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map },http://www.timeout.com/london/film/the-boy-next-door,200,theboynextdoor0,theboynextdoor,timeout

The story is a gender inversion of Fatal Attraction (1987) filtered through a few recent scandals in which female high school teachers were caught fooling around with male students the heroine (Lopez) is seduced by a charming hunk (Ryan Guzman) whos just transferred to her school but he turns psycho on her when she rejects his subsequent advances. The ragged corrective editing gives a good indication of how badly this thing went off track during production; I havent seen a bigger mess in wide release since Dana Carveys career-terminating The Master of Disguise (2002).

But there are many grades of terrible in Hollywood and this is pretty nearly the worst. I watched this with a packed New York preview audience that snickered all the way through the movie and Im glad they were able to find some amusement in the wretched rootless overacting the script written by aliens with no understanding of human psychology or sexuality or entertainment conventions and a ludicrous setup that features Lopez as a high-school teacher who favors ""the classics"" but seems to have no clear idea what that term signifies. (At one point she is given an embossed hardcover copy of ""The Iliad"" which she pronounces without opening to be a ""first edition."" It looks good for a 3000-year-old book Is it signed by the author?)But for my money ""The Boy Next Door"" goes well beyond unintentional humor into grotesque catastrophe and finally into something more like sadness. This seems to be one of those cases where a celebrity performer has no trusted adviser forceful enough to tell her that a self-generated project was not working out quite as well as we had hoped and that everyone involved needed to be bribed into silence and all cameras and files destroyed and shipped to landfills in Uzbekistan. Lopez has always been a limited screen performer in the best of circumstances; she needs a savvy director a strong male co-star and a well-defined script to appear to her best advantage. If her role opposite George Clooney in Steven Soderberghs ""Out of Sight"" is the obvious example more generic exercises like the rom-com ""Maid in Manhattan"" (with Ralph Fiennes) or the thriller ""Parker"" (with Jason Statham) look a lot rosier in retrospect than they did at the time. Compared to this atrocity those forgettable but somewhat competent films are pretty much the collected works of Billy Wilder.What we have here is the unpleasant spectacle of a bad swimmer for whom most of us feel a vague cultural affection floundering in a bottomless pool full of sharks. Lopezs character a quasi-single suburban mom named Claire Peterson bears little relationship to a real person which isnt necessarily a fatal flaw in a thriller. But director Rob Cohen and writer Barbara Curry utterly fail to create any sort of compelling artificial universe in which Claire and her problem - that being the hot 19-year-old lunkhead next door played by a 27-year-old model and martial-arts fighter named Ryan Guzman - might make sense. Cohen is exactly the wrong sort of dude to help Lopez rescue her star career; hes one of those Hollywood lifers who has lots of production credits knows how to navigate the system and conspicuously doesnt give a crap. The high point of his directing career is no doubt the first ""Fast and the Furious"" movie back in 2001 - and while I wont claim to have done a comparative study thats probably the third or fourth best film of that illustrious series.Claire has a wispy almost featureless son named Kevin (Ian Nelson) and is not quite divorced from bluff cheatin husband Garrett (John Corbett). Her supposed best friend is the vice-principal of her school Vicki played by Kristin Chenoweth (of ""Glee"") as a remarkably unappealing assemblage of middle-aged female stereotypes simultaneously fragile mean and slutty. So when Claire starts blatantly checking out the ass of muscular Noah (Guzman) who has moved in with his geezer great-uncle next door under the kind of mysterious circumstances that come with an almost visible asterisk floating in the air (the footnote says ""to be explained later as a totally surprising plot twist"") we dont entirely blame her. Its hard to say what seems least plausible about Noah That hes still in high school that hes also interested in ""the classics"" or that he wears a wussy little inch-wide woolen tie in several scenes. Were they giving that away with the bodybuilding supplements at GNC or something? You Might Also Like Vicki drives Claire toward the solace of Noahs Homeric-epithet forearms by dragging her on heinous double dates with douchey guys who mock her for being an English teacher (or rather a teacher of ""classics""). But as this agonizing exercise dragged on I felt more and more sympathy for the douchey double-date guys who at least own their small-mindedness. The movies depiction of Claire as a ""smart girl"" depends entirely on one or two shots of Lopez in fashionably oversized spectacles. Those shots pale by the way compared to the immense effort expended to reflect the light of the sun the moon and many distant nebulae off Lopezs lips which glisten with an unholy prismatic sheen.I realize this is pedantic but Cohen and Curry and Lopez and everybody else who worked on ""The Boy Next Door"" clearly have no idea that for the past century no one accredited to teach ""The Iliad"" not even a hot high-school teacher in Southern California would present Homer as an individual author who wrote these big-ass poems. (""Homer is a genius"" announces Noah prancing through Claires kitchen in that weird little tie with what is presumably meant to be a lubricious expression. Again to belabor the point Not something someone who had actually read Homer would say) It all fits I guess with the random objects in Claires classroom A bust of Shakespeare a Russian icon a photograph of the Aztec calendar stone. Classics. Of course none of that matters and this would still be a terrible movie if Lopez had learned to read Greek for the role. Have you noticed I havent supplied a plot synopsis? Well here it is Claire sleeps with Noah naturally enough (and I became momentarily engrossed in trying to figure out which shots were Lopez and which a body double). Then he goes all ""Fatal Attraction"" on her and this totally slipshod and unconvincing movie takes a radical left turn into gruesome violence including an apparent reference to the story of Oedipus which screenwriter Curry has perhaps read or heard about even if she never got to ""The Iliad.""I guess the Homeric screw-up sticks in my craw because three minutes on Wikipedia could have cleared it up. That amply testifies that no one even pretended to give a crap that all these supposed movie professionals signed up to work for Jennifer Lopez and cashed her checks and treated the whole thing as flushable and forgettable. Maybe she deserves to wear this folly and failure - I wouldnt know and dont much care. But the shame involved in inflicting this unwatchable disaster on the public and in exposing Hollywood at its most venal stupid and corrupt goes much wider than one deluded star.

"Boy Next Door The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; boy-next-door-the ) Boy Next Door The (United States 2015) January 23 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli Note If anyone cares theres a reference in the next-to-last paragraph that enters spoiler territory. As in end-of-the-movie spoiler territory. For the laughably bad debacle that is The Boy Next Door I wont necessarily blame credited writer Barbara Curry. After all we know how Hollywood works. Maybe what was shot isnt reflective of what she wrote. Maybe her script was a serious erotic thriller with real characters smart dialogue and a surfeit of tension. If that was the case she deserves better than having her name associated with this misfire. But even if The Boy Next Door is a faithful representation of what Curry penned there are enough other problems for her to share only part of the blame. Its badly directed poorly edited and features some of the most unconvincing acting this side of a soup commercial. Hollywood no longer understands how to make erotic thrillers and when they try the result more often than not ends up like The Boy Next Door. Although the movie is rated R it appears to have been afflicted with PG-13-itis. You want erotic? Look back at Body Heat Basic Instinct and Adrian Lynes canon. (The films premise isnt that far from a gender reversed Fatal Attraction which Lyne directed.) In The Boy Next Door the sex scene is shot in such a way as to minimize exposure. Hand-bras and quick cuts abound. Its not sexy. It feels like were in editing 101 where were being instructed how to piece together a sex scene when an actress has an iron-clad no-nudity contract. To make matters worse although the absent nudity in this scene would be justified the nakedness that occurs later in the film (in a scene not featuring Jennifer Lopez) is gratuitous. The problems only begin with the botched sex scene. Theres nothing resembling erotic tension between Lopez who plays 40-something high school teacher Claire Peterson and the ""almost 20"" student with whom she has a one-night stand Noah Sandborn (Ryan Guzman). The filmmakers perhaps worried about the age difference selected Guzman who was 27 at the time of filming and do everything possible to make him appear older. This creates a major suspension of disbelief hurdle to vault over. It doesnt help that Guzman appears to have been chosen more for his studly appearance than his acting ability. His looks are model quality but his range is limited. In attempting to convey strong emotion he does a lot of jaw clenching and line growling. Meanwhile Lopez appears to have largely forgotten how to act. Like Guzman she looks great but gone are even distant echoes of the fantastic performance she gave in Out of Sight. The subject matter - about the consequences of sex between a teacher and student when he becomes obsessed with her - exists almost entirely in the realm of moral grays. That doesnt prevent director Rob Cohen (the same Rob Cohen who brought us the first The Fast and the Furious) from painting with blacks and whites. He does everything possible to make Claire sympathetic and likable - a generous woman who in a moment of weakness makes a mistake. On the other hand Noah is the personification of evil - a psychopath who seduces his teacher (and friends mom) and then uses every tool in the book including blackmail and murder to terrorize her into being with him. Okay so The Boy Next Door isnt interested in being a smart serious look at sexual obsession. It just wants to be a popcorn thriller. Epic fail. The movie repeatedly insults its audience by treating viewers like ADD-afflicted kindergarten students. On one occasion a character has a violent outburst in the halls of a high school that results in him striking a vice principal and beating another student so badly that his skull is fractured. Yet even though the perpetrator is legally an adult there is no police involvement. Later someone believes that erasing a video file from a computer makes it go away. (Even if there isnt a back-up ""deleted"" files can be retrieved.) And of course murderers always keep records of their crimes in easily identifiable folders on a computer that isnt password-protected. Details like these when taken in concert make one wonder whether The Boy Next Door might be a sly subversive parody of the genre. It cant be as dumb as it seems right? Sadly Im afraid that would be giving it too much credit. In the end The Boy Next Door is simply frustrating. Its unfortunate to see a ripe premise rot on the vine. Its depressing to watch the antics of a supposedly savvy protagonist who engages in antics that would embarrass a 1980s scream queen. And its ridiculous to observe a hunky villain who thinks hes in an action movie and needs to be killed several times in order to stay dead. Ah but its January and The Boy Next Door is what we have come to expect from this month. The only thing missing from this excursion into wretchedness is Nic Cage but theres really no role for him. Better productions than this are released direct-to-video every week but I guess someone thought Jennifer Lopezs name might retain a vestige of box office clout. Whether or not The Boy Next Door represents a referendum on her drawing power it makes a statement about the kinds of roles available to her because no one with self-respect would appear in this movie if presented with another option.

"Jenny With the Schlock The Boy Next Door and the Depowering of J.Lo (Plus The Middling Mortdecai) << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Jenny With the Schlock The Boy Next Door and the Depowering of J.Lo (Plus The Middling Mortdecai) Universal Pictures Movies January 23 2015 by Alex Pappademas Facebook Twitter Print In the privacy of my home with only my wife around to fact-check me Ive been known to refer to Jennifer Lopez as ""multi-untalented."" Obviously this isnt fair -- and not just because the ability to weather nearly 20 years of marketplace caprice is a talent in itself if not a superpower. But Lopezs professional identity has long been one of pop cultures most fascinating shell games. For a fly girl she turned out to be a pretty good actor. For an actor she was a pretty good singer. As a singer she sure can dance. This is the remaining-famous equivalent of using your Visa card to pay your Amex bill of pulling off the rate-card trick in lifes casino. Her last truly great movie came out the year Jaden Smith was born; her last truly great single was the no. 1 song in the country on 9/11. (Never forget.) And yet shes still undeniably and irrevocably a star hyperbarically dewy after all of these years outmaneuvering and outlasting the collaborators who supposedly prop her up. Wheres Ja Rule today? Where will Iggy Azalea be tomorrow? As long as there are awards telecasts in need of wattage there will always be a J.Lo and whether or not she wins anything shell always walk away with the show. As a song 2014s ""Booty"" felt almost algorithmically calculated a painstaking and desperate Pinterest board of outsourced ideas -- strike-a-pose finger-snaps off-brand ""Drunk in Love"" snake-synths irritant-of-the-moment Azalea replacing Pitbull on the remix and sounding as always like a tipsy Gwyneth Paltrow doing Jay Pharoahs Jigga. In Hype Williamss lets-get-unitarded video Lopez and Azalea form a callipygian yin-yang and then Lopez slides around in what appears to be a torrent of Astroglide. As a piece of music ""Booty"" is disposable; onstage at the end of the American Music Awards in November Lopez put it over like ""Proud Mary."" The spotlight dance The planet-size disco balls The red glittery tux jacket The salsa horns repurposed from ""Lets Get Loud"" At the end after letting an onstage booty call (from one ""Big D"") go straight to voice mail and shaking that iconic tailfeather in Americas face for five long seconds she said ""Shut it down"" and then held the ABC cameras gaze with the coldest are-you-not-entertained stare imaginable. Michael Tran/FilmMagic The striking thing about that last shot is how much she looked suddenly like a 45-year-old woman whod just done four straight minutes of hard cardio and wanted us to know it. I was indeed entertained; I also felt like I understood her enduring appeal/appealing endurance in a way I never had before. If what you value in pop is spontaneity sudden impact inspiration risk taste freestyle quicksilver and lack of fucks given youve probably already figured out that J.Lo is not singing for you. Shes a show-your-work pop star; visible effort is crucial to her brand. You cant really emulate a Bjork or a Beyonce without being born a world-beating genius but if youre willing to hustle to be about your business you could maybe be J.Lo who wasnt born with it either. Its why even as American Idol spins farther and farther away from the sun shes thrived as den mother and Glinda the Good Cop to the shows parade of spunky strivers. Dont be fooled by the metaphorical rocks kids -- shes a striver too and therefore the ideal face for a show whose eternally suspect thesis is that success accrues to those who want it the baddest. None of this really explains why Lopezs first feature film since 2013s Parker is The Boy Next Door an anemic thriller dumped into the snowy wasteland of Januarys release schedule by the frugalists at Blumhouse Productions. Shes Claire Peterson a high school English teacher whos raising her teenage son Kevin after kicking her cheating husband (John Corbett) to the curb. When hunky Noah (Ryan Guzman from Pretty Little Liars and the fourth and fifth installments of the Step Up saga) moves into the house next door to care for his ailing uncle its Kevin who befriends him first but before long Noah and Claire are bonding over their shared love of ancient Greek literature. ""Dude"" Noah says to Kevin ""you gotta read the Iliad"" then proclaims Homer ""a genius just like Shakespeare Byron Zeppelin Dylan."" Claire practically swooning replies ""Poets."" Later he brings her a copy of the Iliad from a garage sale. ""This is a first edition"" she exclaims. (Of the Iliad? Where was this garage sale the 1400s?) And wouldnt you know -- the bedroom where Claire studies the classics in stylishly cleavage-y loungewear and smart-person-in-a-movie reading glasses has a window that faces Noahs room. She watches him undress; a few scenes later hes undressing her talking in movie-poster copy (""No judgments ... no rules ... just us"") while Lopez makes little appreciative/reluctant meow-meow sex noises just like in the Iliad. Universal Pictures The director is Rob Cohen resurfacing for the first time since 2012s gallopingly dumb Alex Cross; the screenwriter is first-timer Barbara Curry whose story sacrifices psychological intrigue to preserve Claires likability (and Lopezs). Its established early on that Noah having missed some school due to the deaths of both his parents is nearly 20 which means their night of passion isnt against the law. Since Claire and her husband are separated shes only kinda-sorta breaking her marriage vows. And while hes a high school student and shes a teacher shes not his teacher at least not yet. Recall that in Fatal Attraction -- still the gold standard for movies like this -- Michael Douglass character is happily married but decides to have a weekend of gauzily backlit Adrian Lyne sex with Glenn Close because ""the opportunity was there."" Hes deeply complicit; he doesnt quite deserve what happens afterward but he doesnt not deserve it either. This movie wont risk us turning against J.Lo even for a second; by the time Noahs I-wont-be-ignored campaign escalates from Eddie Haskell-ish double entendres to harassment violence and calling Kristin Chenoweth the c-word Claire is inching toward a reconciliation with her husband turning this into a story about a nuclear family fighting off an external threat. Im not seriously going to suggest this movie would have been better at two hours than it is at 91 minutes but it leaves a lot of drama on the table by immediately making Noah into a glowering monster -- by the end of the movie hes basically a Terminator -- and Lopez a pure victim. You always have to wonder why anybody says yes to a project like this one but its a particularly strange choice on Lopezs part since shes done her best work in movies that dare to empower her. Seventeen years ago in Out of Sight Lopezs U.S. Marshal Karen Sisco beat down Isaiah Washington with a few strokes of a telescoping baton then had technically immoral sex with George Clooney a decision for which the story didnt punish her. Michael Apteds Enough from 2002 was nowhere near as good but there was real pulp satisfaction in watching Lopez master Krav Maga in order to kick her abusive husband off a balcony. Sometimes a little smartly executed dumb action is all it takes to turn a career around and put an actor back in touch with his or her strengths; Im guessing Lopez wont ever risk her brand by working with Lars von Trier but cant someone write this woman her own John Wick?  Lionsgate A few weeks ago The Interview brought us to the brink of all-out cyberwar with North Korea; if Englands hacker community has any national pride we should brace for a digital 1812 because Johnny Depps performance as an upper-crust twit in Mortdecai is Britface at its most slanderous. Hes Lord Charlie Mortdecai a gentleman art dealer and upper-class fop whos alienated the affections of his clearly long-suffering wife Johanna (Gwyneth Paltrow) by growing a stupid mustache. Hes also facing a staggering income-tax bill so when an MI5 agent (Ewan McGregor) seeks his aid in locating a purloined Goya he cant say no. In Kyril Bonfigliolis four cult-beloved Mortdecai novels Charlie and his manservant Jock are allegedly a more dissolute Wooster and Jeeves. I havent read them so I cant speculate on whether the boner-and-barf gags in screenwriter Eric Aronsons adaptation represent a betrayal of the source material or fealty to its spirit. It was Bonfiglioli who gave Jock the last name ""Strapp"" so its hard to say for sure. I suppose if you get really hammered on English gin beforehand Mortdecai will play like a wry Old World-meets-modernity comedy in the spirit of The Grand Budapest Hotel; seen straight its an utterly disposable but surprisingly dirty adult-oriented farce that will rise or fall for you based on how willing you are to watch Depp mug and mince for 106 minutes like a tribute-band Peter Sellers. Everyone else mostly stays out of his way with the great Jeff Goldblum and the increasingly tolerable Olivia Munn particularly squandered as an American billionaire and his deceitful horndog daughter. Mortdecai isnt particularly funny but its also not the Pistachio Disguisey 2015 train wreck the Internet has spent the last few months anticipating. Its brainless but its painless.

Geoff Pevere Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jan. 23 2015 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Jan. 23 2015 1200AM EST Comments AA Directed by Rob Cohen Written by Barbara Curry Starring Jennifer Lopez Ryan Guzman and Kristin Chenoweth Country USA Language English As fatal movie booty calls go the one answered by Claire Peterson (Jennifer Lopez) in the rousingly cheesy The Boy Next Door is a doozy.No sooner has this maritally maltreated high school classics teacher succumbed to the breathy ministrations of the ab-alicious neighbours nephew Noah (Ryan Guzman) who has unstuck more than her garage door than shes the Michael Douglas of the soccer mom set. Helen Mirren holds up a sign reading ""Je Suis Charlie"" at the 72nd annual Golden Globe Awards at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on Sunday Jan. 11 2015 in Beverly Hills Calif. Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP Multimedia Who walked the Golden Globes red carpet? An exhaustive photo recollection Gwen Stefani Jon Hamm and Jennifer Lopez were among the winners at the first ever People Magazine Awards in Beverly Hills. (Dec. 19) AP Video Video Video The stars come out for inaugural People Magazine Awards Fast as you can say ""Eddie Haskell"" poor Claire is battling a home invader with mommy issues that would strike even Dr. Phil speechless. By the time this dubious gender-switch bad-date thriller has run its rote route throats will be slashed eyes will be poked fires will be lit and classrooms adorned with copious screen shots of the big bang.But you might well be heartily entertained especially if your tastes tilt toward the toxic junk variety and (even better) if someone else has ponied up for the price of admission. (Best scenario if that boyfriend youve been meaning to dump has provided the tickets.) The one thing about The Boy Next Door which was written by Barbara Curry and directed by the light-touch sensitive-guy perpetrator (Rob Cohen) of a few delicate Vin Diesel and Sylvester Stallone spectacles is that it isnt just bad and ridiculous its fulsomely wholeheartedly and right down-to-its-DNA bad and ridiculous. It commits in other words and follows through on its every idiot promise. If it were The Bachelor there would be riots to marry it on the beach.Where to start? Would it be with the movies hilarious notion of a high school teacher which consists of having Claire quote Homers The Iliad and then melting when the silver-tongued stud arrives with whats described as ""a first edition"" volume of the book that he found ""in a garage sale""? Or might it be the womans-eye view of the object of desire which consists of gauzy body-double insert shots of biceps buns and burnished washboard bellyscapes? How about the almost stupefyingly generic rubber-stamp prime-time TV hunk that is Ryan Guzmans Noah a guy about as convincingly menacing as he is convincingly ""teenaged."" Might it be the weirdly unreal visual texture of Lopezs skin which seems to have been digitally retouched to resemble a fresh batch of butterscotch pudding? Or lest we forget the truly innovative repurposing of an EpiPen as an attention-getting optical accessory? Or possibly just the general configuration of poor Claire as a woman who just cant be punished enough for indulging in a little next-door nookie after her dull-as-dishwater husband (John Corbett) owns up to double-dipping with a younger woman siren calling him from San Francisco? Time was Lopez (an executive producer for Gods sake) was a shotgun-toting leather-skirted hot-as-a-pistol force to be reckoned with in movies such as Out of Sight. Here shes reduced to dressing up in heels and lingerie and peeping through windows at the Calvin Klein kid stripping for bedtime. Feminism? What feminism?Essentially a bottom-of-the-bill drive-in flick in an era that no longer has double-bills or drive-ins The Boy Next Door might once have provided an irresistible opportunity for stealth pop-cultural subversion in the hands of a director who knew how to properly make a budget-conscious meal out of a thick slab of stale cheese. In that movie Lopez might have actually taken some ownership of her actions flushed her shame down the toilet grabbed the nearest shotgun and refused to be bullied into docile bovine submission simply for getting some well-deserved sideline action over the back fence. Here she bakes cookies suffers her husbands serial hound-dogging puts up with her sons petulance and topples for the first psycho Gap-ad refugee who comes along fixes her garage door drops his drawers and quotes Homer.

Their torrid affair takes an obsessive dangerous turn as he befriends her son and she learns he is a 19-year-old student at her high school.(Photo Universal Pictures)Hell befriend your son fix your garage door and wow you with his knowledge of Homer (""Dude youve gotta read The Iliad ""). Just dont sleep with the boy next door because it turns out (gasp) hes a murderous psychopath.So it goes in ""The Boy Next Door"" a routine by-the-numbers erotic thriller assembled from the parts of a thousand predecessors (Blockbuster used to have a whole aisle dedicated to this stuff). This kind of thing could be trashy fun in the hands of a genre satirist but director Rob Cohen continuing his downward slide after helming the first ""Fast and the Furious"" doesnt have the sense of humor to laugh with his subject matter or the wherewithal to spin it in a fresh way. He just sets it in motion and lets the predictable pieces fall into place.Jennifer Lopez plays Claire Peterson a recently divorced high school literature teacher. Her philandering ex-husband (John Corbett) is still in the picture and her high school age son Kevin (Ian Nelson) is so confused over his parents split that his feelings are hurt when Mom decides not to tag along on an upcoming camping trip (you know teenage boys always bumming out when Mom cant go camping with them).Enter the titular Boy Next Door the hunky Noah Sandborn (""Step Up"" series veteran Ryan Guzman) who quickly makes himself a fixture at the Peterson household. If hes not doing ""guy stuff"" with Kevin hes making eyes at Claire and one rainy night she hooks up with the strapping young lad.Big mistake. But rather than exploring the relationship -- it should be noted Noah is a student at Claires school (his character is 19 a quick write-away to avoid any messy legal complications) -- ""The Boy Next Door"" becomes standard stalker fare. Not that much more was to be expected from a January throwaway but it could have had some fun along the way. Rather than being good-bad ""The Boy Next Door"" is just plain bad.agrahamdetroitnews.comtwitter.com/grahamoramaThe Boy Next DoorGRADE D+Rated R for violence sexual content/nudity and language.Running time 91 minutes 3 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1BOm59B MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2015/01/23/boy-next-door-dumb-fun-minus-fun/22177049/,200,theboynextdoor8,theboynextdoor,detroitnews

An affair takes a dangerous turn in ""The Boy Next Door"" with Ryan Guzman and Jennifer Lopez. (Suzanne Hanover / AP) Robert Abele Jennifer Lopez catches the eye of a 19-year-old; things slide downhill from there in Boy Next Door No good sex goes unpunished in ""The Boy Next Door"" breathless uninspired January junk that feels like the iffiest bits of a Lifetime movie and late-night cable schlock slapped together. (And not erotically.)In what qualifies as a stretch the definitely-knows-shes-sexy Jennifer Lopez plays a doesnt-know-shes-sexy high school English teacher named Claire newly separated and eager to restore domestic bliss with her husband (John Corbett) and teenage son (Ian Nelson). But when hunky new 19-year-old neighbor and transfer student Noah (Ryan Guzman) -- whom director Rob Cohen introduces biceps-first -- talks a mean Iliad and befriends her shy kid Claire gives in one night to Noahs flirtations and her own impulses.Noah of course is rancid beefcake an obsessed psycho who doesnt take kindly to Claires next-day regrets. Noah violently turning Claires life upside down is meant to be trashy fun but Cohen and screenwriter Barbara Curry dont have the deranged heart or the skill at smoothing over dumb plotting to make disreputably pleasurable exploitation. ""The Boy Next Door"" isnt frenzied just by-the-numbers despite some hilarious Hays Code era-worthy visual metaphors early on (Noah fixing Claires garage door a rattled Claire dropping a pie). Lopez is suitably gung-ho with her succession of terrified reactions but the biggest problem is that Guzman is mostly a smirking bore too blandly handsome and one-note to give his character the attention-must-be-paid home-wrecking spirit of a Glenn Close in ""Fatal Attraction.""

Watch in Times Video >> embed He can fix garage doors beat up bullies and analyze ""The Iliad"" but dont be fooled The new almost-20-year-old neighbor Noah (Ryan Guzman) is a nightmare for an almost divorced schoolteacher Claire Peterson (Jennifer Lopez) in ""The Boy Next Door."" She succumbs to his flattery and his sculpted body one night after walking out on a date and the rest of the movie is devoted to showing how bad an idea that passionate mistake was.Rob Cohens determined movie is basically a stalker story except that the aggressor bunks 50 feet away. It takes care to counteract the novelty of its gender adjustment to the obsessed-lover formula -- hes a dude instead of a temptress -- by being utterly routine in other respects. Noah is enraged when Claires husband (John Corbett) tries to wheedle his way back so he starts tormenting her and feeding anti-dad bile to her suggestible son Kevin (Ian Nelson). Photo Ryan Guzman and Jennifer Lopez star in Rob Cohens ""The Boy Next Door."" Credit Suzanne Hanover/Universal Pictures Unflagging in her relaxed appeal Ms. Lopez never talks down to the often laughably written material even when the story muzzles her authority-figure character with Claires dirty little secret and loses its sense of humor. (It takes forever and a murder before she finally calls 911.) Mr. Cohen no stranger to delivering pulp product employs visual cliches as if they were flash cards; no exposed thigh or made-you-jump reveal goes unexploited. Kristin Chenoweth has a sweetly frank turn as Claires best friend at work and her loyalty convinces more than Noahs abruptly vomiting forth his case history. But mostly you wish the desire-punishing story line would let Claire say ""enough"" sooner.""The Boy Next Door"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

Photo Universal Pictures MOVIE REVIEW The Boy Next Door New low for J.Lo. Running time 91 minutes. Rated R (violence sex/nudity profanity). Now playing. Unintended laughs far far outnumber intended thrills as Jennifer Lopez -- playing the hottest and dumbest high school teacher in America -- has a one-night stand with a hunky student and then wishes she hadnt all the way till the end credits roll in the ludicrously plotted ""The Boy Next Door. All it takes to get into her panties is a set of chiseled abs a gift of a ""first edition of the Iliad from a ""garage sale and a few lines of hokey love patter (""A woman like you should be cherished). J.Los English teacher Claire quickly tumbles into bed with her new 19-year-old neighbor Noah (Ryan Guzman who is not only a terrible actor but easily looks a decade older) while her teenage son is off on a camping trip with her estranged husband (John Corbett). The boy next door (Ryan Guzman) has something in store.Photo Universal Pictures Claire of course spends the rest of the film regretting this night of artfully posed and lit passion as Noah instantly turns into a full-on psychopath when she rejects his repeated overtures for seconds. Gales of laughter erupted at my screening when Claire walks into her classroom and discovers that Noah -- who has been suspended from school by this point -- has somehow gotten in and papered the room with hundreds of printouts of a compromising video frame grab with more spewing from a fax machine. Thats far from the most unbelievable twist in the script credited to former prosecutor Barbara Curry. Claire and her best friend the vice principal (Broadways Kristin Chenoweth in her largest and most thankless screen role to date) plot a ridiculous scheme for Claire to sneak into Noahs home. Its not really giving anything away to report that Claire actually deletes evidence incriminating Noah for the death of his parents. She then calls the vice principals cellphone and -- before anyone says ""hello -- breathlessly reports what shes found. Not hard to guess who is listening on the other end of the line. Then again Claire is the sort of woman-in-peril who always neglects to draw the blinds while mincing around her bedroom in lingerie and stilettos -- and her makeup and hair is always flawless even when shes trussed up in a burning building. Directed by Rob Cohen as an unabashed trash wallow ""The Boy Next Door wants badly to be a cut-rate ""Fatal Attraction but ends up getting more laughs than many comedies.

"The Boy Next Door stars JLo in predictable plot review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Boy Next Door stars JLo in predictable plot reviewJennifer Lopez never much of an actress and best suited to the rom-coms cant manage a thriller. By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. Jan. 22 2015The Boy Next DoorStarring Jennifer Lopez Ryan Guzman Kristin Chenoweth John Corbett and Ian Nelson. Directed by Rob Cohen. 90 minutes. Opening Friday Jan. 23 at major theatres. 14AThe sex is surprisingly steamy considering how dumb and dull The Boy Next Door is inspiring more unintentional laughter than thrills with Jennifer Lopez as a teacher who has an ill-advised one night stand and spends the rest of the movie -- along with us -- paying for it.As California high school teacher Claire Peterson Lopez looks great and works little explaining The Iliad to just one class with only a handful of pupils. She cites J.K. Rowling as a fellow classics major who hit the big time and dresses like no teacher outside 1980s MTV her lips never missing a generous slick of pink gloss which actually becomes distracting in its gloppy presence.Article Continued BelowClaires main role is big-hearted ex-wife and mom. Shes struggling with the breakup of her marriage after catching husband Garrett (John Corbett) cheating with his secretary. Hes begging to come home and Claire is considering it to the dismay of her bestie and school vice-principal Vicky (a shrill Kristin Chenoweth). But a reunion would make her fragile hyper-allergic teen son Kevin (Ian Nelson) happy.Jennifer Lopez stars in The Boy Next Door.Enter the ""boy"" next door Noah (Ryan Guzman of the Step Up franchise) a handsome youth newly arrived to care for his ailing uncle (who bears a striking resemblance to Johnny Knoxvilles titular Bad Grandpa).The ""nearly 20"" Noah immediately cozies up to the family doing odd jobs and helping Kevin make time with his classroom crush while tempting Claire with bulging biceps and Eddie Haskell-grade compliments.Theres a vague mention of ""an accident"" that means Noah is going to finish high school now. Claire is encouraging perhaps more than she means to be when Noah catches her giving him the once over from her bedroom giving new meaning to ""rear window.""Their inevitable rainy-night encounter wrapped in a disturbing ""no-means-yes"" vibe leaves Claire feeling regret and Noah not happy about being rebuffed. Suddenly Noahs got a temper. And a new obsession. He shows up as the new kid in Claires class sauntering in quoting Homer (not Simpson) and wiggling his eyebrows like a 1920s Lothario. Noah keeps the pressure on with computer hacking and threats adding more menace and new tricks to back Claire into a corner. But to what purpose?""Leave me and my family alone"" Claire cries. I cant replies Noah. I live next door. ZingLopez never much of an actress and best suited to the rom-coms she made a decade or so ago like The Wedding Planner and Shall We Dance cant manage to sell a thriller even one as lazy and predictable as The Boy Next Door.Lawyer-turned-screenwriter Barbara Curry sticks to the basics with her first script failing to flesh out her characters while indulging in leapfrogging logic that leads to a weirdly abrupt finish. Meanwhile Rob Cohen (Alex Cross The Fast and the Furious) directs the action in predictable ways letting the camera linger on JLos much-lauded gravity-defying backside. It gives us something to admire when all around is not nearly so interesting.

Johnson ""The Boy Next Door"" The Boy Next Door meets every expectation unashamedly By Kevin C. Johnson / pop music critic / kjohnsonpost-dispatch.com Kevin C. Johnson Jan 22 2015 (...) ""The Boy Next Door"" ""The Boy Next Door"" ""The Boy Next Door"" ""The Boy Next Door"" Kevin C. Johnson ""The Boy Next Door"" One thing moviegoers must never take with them to a Jennifer Lopez erotic psychological thriller is expectations.That holds true for ""The Boy Next Door."" Its unashamedly of the B-movie variety -- a quick and easy time-killer.Nearly nothing is left unturned in the name of sensational cheesy thrills from gratuitous nudity to eye gouging and a plot fueled by characters who make all the wrong choices. (Cue moviegoers talking back to the screen.) Lopez is Claire a high school literature teacher we know we must take seriously after spotting her in spectacles and a demure mustard-colored turtleneck. Shes coping with a divorce from husband Garrett (John Corbett) and her teenage son Kevin (Ian Nelson) is bullied at school.Enter Noah (Ryan Guzman) the strapping 19-year-old who moves in next door to help out his elderly uncle. Hes too good to be true -- too handsome too helpful and too handy. Wait ... what was that about his parents death in an accident?After a disastrous double date with her friend and colleague (Kristin Chenoweth in a thankless role) Claire has a one-night stand with Noah. Previously hed noticed her through their facing windows eyeing him naked in his bedroom. The morning afterglow is nonexistent. Claire wakes up with remorse telling Noah that the night before was a mistake that can never happen again. He doesnt take it well and wont stay away. His slow taunts (including slyly telling Kevin ""I love your mothers cookies"") escalate into full-blown stalking.One of Noahs big show pieces is plastering her classroom with hundreds of photos of their lovemaking. His onslaught of obsessive terror is never enough for Claire to actually call the authorities. Directed by Rob Cohen (""The Fast and the Furious"") ""The Boy Next Door"" is nothing if not obvious. You know the innocent appearance of a knife as Claire slices a birthday cake will come into play later much like a gun from an early scene. The scares are just as predictable and its easy to spot which ones are the fake-outs.For some viewers ""The Boy Next Door"" will serve as a sort of sequel to another of Lopezs damsel-in-distress flicks 2002s ""Enough"" (the two films are unrelated) while also conjuring up everything from ""Fatal Attraction"" ""Obsessed"" and ""No Good Deed.""What ""The Boy Next Door""  Two stars out of four  Rating R  Run time 131  Content Violence sexual content/nudity and language Kevin C.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint For a hot sociopath Noah Sandberg sure is tedious. Barely legal Noah (Ryan Guzman of the ""Step Up"" dance-movie franchise) seems like an all-American model-handsome nice guy when he moves in with his elderly uncle to help him recover from a transplant. He and his triceps befriend next-door neighbor Claire Peterson (Jennifer Lopez) who teaches ""the classics"" at the local high school and her allergy-prone picked-on son Kevin (Ian Nelson). Claire is separated from her cheatin husband (a practically sleepwalking John Corbett) who is bent on reconciling. But when father and son go camping for the weekend the molten stares that Claire and Noah have been exchanging from their upstairs windows fueled by an apparent mutual love of Homer turn into the inevitable night of slo-mo choreographed grappling. When she tells him it was a one-time-thang big mistake young Jekyll begins to show his Hyde side quickly escalating threats to harm Claires career and family -- and also auditing her class. Yet for all his sudden fits of violent temper and plastering her classroom with compromising photos Guzman cant muster up a truly scary persona. Kristen Chenoweth offers camp relief as Claires BFF the schools vice principal. But with the exception of that one steamy sexual encounter between two super-toned bods (very nice navel J. Lo) and a nail-biter involving an out-of-control car on a curvy cliff road ""The Boy Next Door"" is a string of situations in which the actors Job One is keeping straight faces while uttering lines like ""A woman like you should be cherished."" Until the end with a fiery climax so ridiculous it prompted bursts of laughter from a preview audience. Director Rob Cohen (""The Fast and the Furious"") knows his way around action scenes but can do only so much with the clunky script by first-timer Barbara Curry a former assistant U.S. attorney whose MFA in screenwriting from UCLA doesnt appear to have given her much practice in dialogue. the boy next door 1/2 out of 4 stars Rating R for violence sexual content/nudity and language. ktillotsonstartribune.com 612-673-7046 StribKristin View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

"The Boy Next Door review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review The Boy Next Door The Boy Next Door Universal Pictures Ryan Guzman and Jennifer Lopez in ""The Boy Next Door."" Ryan Guzman and Jennifer Lopez in ""The Boy Next Door."" (Universal Pictures) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune One night with the psycho-hunk next door and its ""uh-oh"" time for Jennifer Lopez. As the song from ""Meet Me in St. Louis"" put it in a different story context How can she ignore the boy next door?She cant Jennifer Lopez just cant. The boy next door played by Ryan Guzman is just too darn hot. Psycho but hot. And this week after so much ""American Sniper"" analysis of patriotism jingoism geopolitical morality and cinematic debate its important to remember what two things we as a nation fight for every day of our lives the sight of Lopezs epochal posterior in horizontal stripes and the God-given right to make a ridonculous thriller like ""The Boy Next Door."" Lopez plays Claire suburban Los Angeles high school literature teacher (""the classics"" she says huffily describing her core curriculum). Her marriage (John Corbett husband) is on the rocks. Inevitably her loins are stirred then shaken by the arrival of the hunk next door Noah portrayed by Guzman. He seems nice enough in a turning-stalker-any-second-now way; he wears superclean white T-shirts is handy with tools (double-entendre) adores Homers ""Iliad"" (Claire can barely believe her lit-hunk luck and try saying that three times fast) and goes out of his way to befriend Claires insecure son played by Ian Nelson.While estranged husband and teenage son are away on a camping trip Claire capitulates to those psycho-bedroom eyes that have been undressing her ever since the scene when Noah shows up to fix her broken garage door. As written by Barbara Curry and directed competently but without much energy by Rob Cohen (""The Fast and the Furious"") the affair is a fraught and joyless occasion for a montage of body parts in low light. Composer Randy Edelman and Nathan Barrs sinister-orgasm theme sets the mood for instantaneous regret even before Noah gets clingy and violent and then serial-killy. I wish ""The Boy Next Door"" were a different zingier sort of mediocrity but whenever it threatens to go the full Zalman King ""Two Moon Junction"" route it pulls back and behaves itself and settles for a grindingly predictable series of escalations. Talking about actors ages is stupid thing to do in most cases but Guzman is 27 playing a teenager (""almost 20"") who could pass for 30 and Lopez who is 45 has spent a great deal of gym time keeping in tremendous shape in case a second ""Booty"" video comes up. Theres peculiarly little of the forbidden-fruit aspect at work. My favorite thing about ""The Boy Next Door"" is the way Lopezs lip gloss in each close-up appears to have been reapplied with extreme care a millisecond before Cohen said ""Action"" Or rather ""Inaction"" Latest movies reviewedOpen link ""The Boy Next Door"" - 1 1/2 starsMPAA rating R (for violence sexual content/nudity and language)Running time 131Opens Thursday eveningmjphillipstribune.comTwitter phillipstribune Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Jennifer Lopez Reviews Fast and Furious (movie series) Review Cake Review The Humbling Review Strange Magic Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising76deg",http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-boy-next-door-20150122-column.html#navtype=barker&barkername=Barker%2006%20-%20In%20Case%20You%20Missed%20It,200,theboynextdoor17,theboynextdoor,chicagotribune

What is disappointing is that its not fun junk. It doesnt even merit a good hate-watching because the whole thing is so meh.The action centers on Claire Peterson a gorgeous high-school instructor who teaches the classics. Shes played by Jennifer Lopez and some fabulous eye shadow. Now nothing against Lopez but she doesnt exactly suggest here that she has pored over the works of Aristotle and Euripides.Claire is separated thanks to the philandering ways of her husband (John Corbett). Their teenage son Kevin (Ian Nelson) is lonely and bullied. Claire tries to date but that goes terribly wrong (he doesnt get the classics). Essentially her life is in a major slump.Things start looking up when a dreamboat 19-year-old named Noah (Ryan Guzman from ""Pretty Little Liars"") moves in next door. He befriends Kevin fixes garage doors and flirts endlessly with Claire. He also loves the classics (sigh) and gifts Claire with a first edition of Homers ""The Iliad."" (Side note Im no book collector but wouldnt that be like a gazillion years old?)Claire succumbs to temptation and enjoys a one-night stand with the hunky teen. She realizes its a mistake the next morning but its already too late. Noah turns all Glenn Close on her saying wink-wink things like ""I love your mothers cookies"" in front of her son. Thank heavens Claire doesnt have a pet bunny because we all know what would happen next.Things escalate to jump scares and gory horror-movie violence but the momentum never picks up. Director Rob Cohen (""xXx"" ""The Fast and the Furious"") normally has a way with kinetic action sequences so the movies staid quality is a letdown. The finale which should at least allow Lopez to engage in a fun turn-the-tables butt-kicking -- ala the stars 2002 ""Enough"" -- is flat-out unexciting.One of the movies biggest issues is that its played too straight. Perhaps if Cohen displayed some of his usual flair and the actors camped it up a bit the thing may have worked as a good guilty pleasure. You do feel guilty watching ""The Boy Next Door"" but theres not much pleasure in it.The Boy Next Door 2 stars (out of 5)Director Rob Cohen.Cast Jennifer Lopez Ryan Guzman Kristin Chenoweth John Corbett.Rating R for violence sex nudity and profanity.Reach the reporter at randy.cordovaarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8849.

(Suzanne Hanover/cbs films) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday January 22 2015 1200 PM Title THE BOY NEXT DOOR Film Info With Jennifer Lopez Ryan Guzman A woman fends off a crazy admirer. Director Rob Cohen (131) R Violence sexuality. Area theaters. There was once a perfect Jennifer Lopez role -- in ""Out of Sight"" Steven Soderberghs 1998 action drama. Lopez played tough sexy U.S. Marshal Karen Sisco. You know whats not a great role for her? A hunted haunted victim in a low-rent thriller like ""The Boy Next Door."" Even in this dreck though it comes as a bit of a surprise how comfortable and appealing Lopez is on camera. Music may always be her first love but the camera remains smitten with her. Over more than 20 years of movies Lopezs style in good movies and bad has been beguiling and unhurried. She lets the movie find her. It may be counterintuitive given her bigger-than-life offscreen image but in movies she knows the subtle way to dance. Thats even true in ""Boy"" an invite she ought to have declined. Lopez plays Claire Peterson a sexy fortysomething high school teacher whose home life is in disarray. Shes separated from her husband Garrett (John Corbett) after he strayed but theyre working things out. Their teenage son Kevin (Ian Nelson) is in need of some parental guidance. Then Claire catches the eye of Noah (Ryan Guzman) the nephew of her ailing next-door neighbor. Noah is 19 but because hes relocated after the death of his parents hes only a senior at the school where Claire teaches classic literature. He and Kevin form a bond but Noah is really focused on Claire. The two share thoughts about poetry. She makes him dinner when he calls up flummoxed about chicken. Ryan Guzman needs to give Jennifer Lopez some space. (cbs films) After they stumble into a late-night tryst that Claire immediately regrets Noah refuses to be ignored. Rebuffed by her he gets wiggy and embarrasses his beloved while shes working seduces Kevins pretty crush (Lexi Atkins) threatens Claires suspicious friend (Kristin Chenoweth) and strings Claires husband up until she loves Noah back. Its Fatal Attraction 101. And it feels like a bunny boiled way back in the early 90s when movies like ""Deceived"" ""The Hand That Rocks the Cradle"" and ""Sleeping with the Enemy"" mixed sex and psychos. Not much has changed except that Guzmans lovesick nutter is more forgettable but has access to technology (including in one moment freeze-dried from two decades ago an XXX-rated Xerox of Claire). Lopez emerges with most of her dignity intact from this shadowy gutteral film which includes screwdrivers in the head and cheeseball jolts. Its all lowest-common-denominator work for an actress whose appeal adds up to so much more. jneumaiernydailynews.com Follow me on TWITTER NeumaierMovies Catch ""Joe Neumaiers Movie Minute"" throughout the day Thurs. - Sun. on New Yorks WOR 710 AM and at wor710.com.

And his taste in women is definitely sophisticated. He fixates on Claire and in a weak moment Claire falls like a wounded cougar into his well-muscled arms.Its definitely an affair to remember.Next Door is not quite as moralistic as 1987s Fatal Attraction where Michael Douglas character was married and had a one-night stand. The scenario here is that Claires husband (John Corbett) had cheated on her with his secretary. This cliched indiscretion led to their separation. Kristin Chenoweth brings some knowing humor to the role of Claires best friend.Claires dalliance is tastefully steamy with plenty of camera time devoted to Lopez and Guzmans toned bods and her black lacy underthings. The two spend as much time peering out from behind curtains at each other as the most avid Peeping Toms.Lopez is believably powerful in moments of physical conflict. But shes unconvincing as a teacher. She gets top marks for grooming however. Even when shes frazzled as her classroom is strewn with incriminating photocopied evidence of her hook-up with Noah her hair remains perfectly coiffed. And when all hell is crashing down her shiny lip gloss and impeccable eye shadow never falter.While the jolts during those perilous moments tend to be telegraphed a few inspire jumps and nervous laughter.The Boy Next Door is an improvement on Lopezs forgettable rom-coms. And while not exactly an inventive story the movie is a diverting guilty pleasure laden with eye candy and familiar thrills. 39 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 6 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1JmAeK4",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2015/01/22/the-boy-next-door-review/22094445/,200,theboynextdoor20,theboynextdoor,usatoday

It looks cheaply made and has a plot hinging on provocation and contrivance far more than good sense or good taste. Its shockingly the schlockiest possible iteration of the elevator pitch ""What if Jennifer Lopez had a one-night stand with her teenage neighbor and then he got violent?"" Its hard to decide the movies best screamer Is it that Lopez teaches ""AP Classics""? That her paramour-turned-stalker knows how to remotely control printers and uses this superpower to humiliate her? Any of the jaw-droppingly lewd come-ons in the films trailer? The Boy Next Door is not meant to be good. But its release should be applauded nonetheless. Lets be clear Itd probably be a victory for Hollywood if the projects it gave to actresses as charismatic as Lopez were better than The Boy Next Door. But many many movies are as bad or worse; that is The Boy Next Door is not exceptional in a film landscape where there have been three Takens. The thing is most cheaply made bids at box-office success star Liam Neesons not Jennifer Lopezes. What makes The Boy Next Door important is its subject matter and casting Its an explicitly commercial film focused on the (bizarrely unrealistic) life of a middle-aged woman. And for that reason it couldnt come at a better moment. At last years Academy Awards Cate Blanchett accepting the Best Actress prize exhorted Hollywood to do better by its women decrying ""the idea that female films with women at the center are niche experiences. They are not. Audiences want to see them and in fact they earn money."" A year later the movie industry hasnt gotten the memo. While the Best Actor nominees drawn from a competitive field each come from movies that met with wide acclaim four of the five Best Actress nominees performed in movies that received no nominations in other fields as if the Academy couldnt figure out any way to honor a womans story or maybe thought there werent enough stories about women worth honoring. (The fifth Best Actress nominee by the way was Felicity Jones in The Theory of Everything -- a movie about the life of Stephen Hawking in which she plays supportive wife.) This phenomenon makes a sort of sense There are far more movies made about the lives of men than about the lives of women from the arthouse to the Marvel universe (where the announcement of a standalone female superhero movie had been very slow in coming). But its truly strange to witness how those films about women that are made get marketed. Julianne Moores Oscar bid Still Alice for instance is a viscerally moving film about the onset of illness paced like an old-fashioned weepie and based on a best-selling novel. What failure of imagination led its studio to give it a tiny release in New York and Los Angeles rather than the major rollout that could have turned it into a genuine hit? If Jennifer Aniston and her studio were as confident in Cake as their zealous (and ultimately unsuccessful) Oscar Best Actress campaign implied why did they hide the movie from the public? Its still not in theaters despite Anistons many interviews about how hard she worked to transform herself. The only actress this year who managed to merge critical acclaim commercial success and Oscar attention was Rosamund Pike in Gone Girl in which she plays a woman who habitually fakes her own rape in order to get back at men. Thats a particularly disturbing vision of womanhood -- but its the one that Hollywood was okay with endorsing at the loudest possible volume. Say this for The Boy Next Door a movie in absolutely zero danger of getting Lopez an invitation to the 2016 Oscars Its actually very kind to her character. Every action Lopezs character undertakes is given clear justifications. She sleeps with her neighbor whos a student at her school but its at a moment of extreme vulnerability as her marriage collapses and the ""high school student"" is 19 (and looks 30). She then quite rationally explains over and over that she made a very bad mistake and wants to calmly move forward with her life; meanwhile her neighbor puts her through hell. No film with this much violence against its female characters could credibly be called feminist but Lopez gets every opportunity to defend herself both against charges of child endangerment and charges of being too intellectual for her own good. (J. K. Rowling she tells a callous date studied classics. And shes a billionaire.) The Boy Next Doors depiction of a woman whos capable of making mistakes without allowing them to define her is orders of magnitude more sophisticated than viewers should expect. If we want better movies about women we have to start with movies about women in the first place. The Boy Next Door wastes Lopezs talents just as much of the schlock classic actresses like Joan Crawford or Bette Davis appeared in wasted theirs. That was the price they paid for working in an era when enough movies about women were made that a few might be good. Lopezs new project represents an earnest attempt to capitalize on a very real public hunger to see a woman at the center of a mainstream movie -- not an indie but an old-fashioned popcorn flick. Can either the boy-centric Best Picture nominees or the elusive Best Actress pictures say that? If every director at every level of ambition were making commercially ambitious movies about women The Boy Next Door wouldnt feel so perversely refreshing. But its director is one of very few who actually did. Read Next Your browser is out of date.

Photo Handout / McClatchy-Tribune News Service The Boy Next Door review Should be left at home 1 / 4 Back to Gallery ""Well that wasnt as bad as I thought it was going to be"" said one young woman as she exited a screening of ""The Boy Next Door"" the thriller starring Jennifer Lopez and directed by Rob Cohen. I beg to differ. The movie was just as bad as I thought it was going to be. After all the trailer alone for ""The Boy Next Door"" was already getting laughs and not for the right reasons especially for the not-so-subtle phrase ""I love your moms cookies."" That unfortunate line was uttered by Noah (Ryan Guzman) a 19-year-old troubled teen who just moved into the residence next to Claire (Lopez). The high school AP classics teacher (Im not making that up) has been struggling with a troubled marriage Claires husband (John Corbett) had cheated on her and moved out of the house. During one dark and stormy night (cliche intended) Claire sleeps with Noah. That momentary act of indiscretion seems to unleash the powerful crazy within Noah who proceeds to hack e-mails and sabotage cars before gradually working himself up to gun violence and murder. Suffice it to say the script defies both good taste and plain old logic. During one scene Noah gives Claire a copy of the Greek epic poem ""The Iliad"" by Homer. ""Oh a first edition"" Claire says. A first edition? Did the author sign it? (""The Iliad"" was written during the eighth century B.C.) Why Lopez decided to do this inept cliche-infested film is anyones guess. She may be an actress of limited range but her work includes solid movies like ""Selena"" and ""Out of Sight."" Unfortunately Lopezs resume now includes this stinker. And were all the dumber for it.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it Directed by Rob Cohen ""The Boy Next Door"" stars Jennifer Lopez in a leading role and explores a forbidden attraction that goes too far. (Universal Pictures) By Michael OSullivan January 22 2015 If youve seen the deliciously bad trailer for ""The Boy Next Door"" you already know some of the films best -- which is to say its worst -- lines. ""I love your moms cookies"" may go down in history as the most hilariously inappropriate double-entendre ever spoken by one high school student to another after the first one has slept with his schoolmates mother. That is the premise of this future camp classic in which Jennifer Lopezs schoolteacher character has ill-advised rebound sex with a studly student (Ryan Guzman) after catching her husband (John Corbett) cheating on her. It should be noted that at 45 Lopez remains in fine form. Director Rob ""The Fast and the Furious"" Cohen lavishes almost as much attention on her body as he does on Guzmans buns which are presented as two of the films other small pleasures. That this lucky student Noah is said to be almost 20 makes it only slightly less icky than it sounds even though its never adequately explained why the kid is still taking AP classes when most others his age would be halfway through college. Guzman whos actually pushing 30 -- and whose character quotes Homers ""Iliad"" and wears neckties to class -- looks more like the undercover cops from ""21 Jump Street"" than a boy. Its just one of the films many improbabilities which will either flow over you like water if you let them or irritate like an itchy wool sweater if you fight them. Quickly Noah is revealed to be a psychotic stalker who wont take no for an answer when Lopezs Claire comes to her senses and tries to break off their relationship. ""I will never ever"" he tells Claire pausing for dramatic effect ""going to let you go."" (This laughably ungrammatical statement may explain why he has been held back at school.) Before long Noah has transformed from Jason Schwartzmans precocious preppy in ""Rushmore"" into Glenn Close from ""Fatal Attraction."" Like a car careening down the Hollywood hills without brakes -- yes thats a scene in the film -- ""The Boy Next Door"" rushes pell-mell from psychological thriller territory into the realm of horror film. At times Noah is like a distant cousin of Norman Bates with better abs. Ryan Guzman as the boy next door who goes for a little extra credit with his friends mom -- a teacher -- played by Jennifer Lopez. (Universal Pictures) Though its studio Blumhouse Productions is best known for the ""Paranormal Activity"" series and other frightfests ""The Boy Next Door"" plays best as unintentional comedy. Its a movie about a young man with an unhealthy mother fixation but if you go into it expecting something closer to ""Mommie Dearest"" than ""Psycho"" youll probably have a much better time.  1/2 R. At area theaters. Contains violence sex brief nudity and obscenity. 91 minutes.

"The Boy Next Door (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Boy Next Door (R) Jennifer Lopez stars as a single mom stalked by her teenage neighbor. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com1/22/2015 Editor rating 1.5 All bad movies should have the decency to be as entertaining as The Boy Next Door a boilerplate preposterous thriller about a single mother (Jennifer Lopez) stalked by the psychotic hunk who moves into her neighborhood. Written by Barbara Curry (this is her first screenplay) and directed by Rob Cohen (Stealth The Skulls Alex Cross) the film is so gleefully ridiculous that you start to suspect the filmmakers were in on the joke and forgot to tell the actors. Lopez who seems to be fond of playing women who are victimized by bad husbands or boyfriends (Enough El Cantante U Turn) is all business as Claire a schoolteacher separated from her cheating husband (John Corbett) and raising their teenage son (Ian Nelson) by herself. Then Noah (Ryan Guzman) a 19-year-old with an underwear models physique and an allergy to shirt sleeves moves in next door to look after his ailing great-uncle. Within minutes of meeting the likable Noah is already fixing Claires garage door which pleases her greatly because everyone knows women are completely helpless when it comes to simple repairs around the house. Or maybe Claire didnt want to mess up her makeup and hair since she always looks like shes heading out to attend the Oscars even when shes puttering around the house grading her students homework. Immediately there are red flags all over the place such as the vague way in which Noah refers to an ""accident"" as the reason why he moved to a new home and then quickly changes the subject or the fact that hes 19 years old and can quote Homer by heart but still hasnt graduated from high school. Even Claires best friend (Kristin Chenoweth) immediately notices theres something strange about the kid (""I cant put my finger on it"" she says ominously). But Claire ignores all the warning signs and becomes a Peeping Mom looking in on Noahs bedroom from her window as the young man undresses before bed or rushing over to his house when he calls and asks her to help him cook a chicken. No seriously. One brief but surprisingly explicit sex scene later Claire is racked with guilt and Noah is completely smitten. The movie excuses Claires cougar-like behavior by showing us she was a bit tipsy the night of the tryst -- dont judge her it was the wine -- but after Noah has had a taste he starts to crave more. When Claire rebuffs him the lunatic decides to terrorize and stalk her. The Boy Next Door occasionally doles out a memorable line that implies the movie is not meant to be taken all that seriously (""I love your mothers cookies"" Noah tells Claires son creating an instant meme). But other exchanges are unintentionally hilarious not quite on the level of Showgirls but in the same general ballpark (""Go eff yourself"" Claire shouts at Noah. ""Maybe I should eff you first"" Noah shoots back). Guzman a handsome actor who is not entirely without talent plays Noah as an evil mastermind with six-pack abs who can anticipate other peoples moves and its fun to watch him insinuate himself into Claires life even though his actions defy all credibility. There isnt anything here you havent seen a million times before including that old but reliable jump scare of a cat suddenly jumping into the frame meowing loudly. But Cohens elegant direction helps the cliches go down smoothly and the way his camera ogles Guzmans body is an intentional reversal of the way most directors ogle their female stars. Best of all is the cracked delirious finale which takes place inside a burning barn because why not? Although the film doesnt contain much violence an unexpected bit of horrific Game of Thrones-worthy gore made a preview audience explode into laughs and cheers. The Boy Next Door is a factory-line thriller the sort of modestly budgeted unchallenging picture Hollywood cranks out to feed the multiplex machine during the doldrums of January. But whatever charges you can level at the movie and they are legion boring isnt one of them. Cast Jennifer Lopez Ryan Guzman Kristin Chenoweth John Corbett Ian Nelson. Director Rob Cohen.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet So lurid and campy that it registers as inspired Rob Cohens low-budget thriller The Boy Next Door takes a Lifetime Original premise--a woman has a fling with her 19-year-old neighbor who turns out to be a maniac--and pumps it full of Oedipal references and yellow lighting. Plenty of credit is due to Barbara Currys deranged script set in a suburban fantasyland of doofus bullies junior proms and middle-class sex fears; it probably isnt meant to be a Verhoeven satire but it sure moves like one. Opening with what may be the worst marriage-on-the-rocks montage in film history The Boy Next Door introduces Claire (Jennifer Lopez face occasionally blurred by digital wrinkle removal) a jogging hard-working teacher and mother who enjoys hanging out in her best friends stock-photo-ready kitchen and who cant decide whether to divorce her philandering husband. Enter new neighbor Noah (Ryan Guzman) the bug-eyed sexual bogeyman who speaks in classical quotations (""Homer Byron Zeppelin Dylan. The poets."") and tortured double-entendres; he also has the near-supernatural ability to slip into the frame out of nowhere. It doesnt take long--what they used to call the beginning of reel two-- for Claire to sleep with him though by that point hes already fixed her garage door given her a copy of The Iliad (""a first edition"") and developed a relationship with her teenage son that contains more than a trace of homoerotic tension.She chalks their one-night stand up to too many glasses of wine. He goes berserk skipping right past the threatening phone call/slashed tires phase into blackmail brake sabotage kidnapping and murder. As he conveniently never graduated from high school he enrolls in her AP Classics course burns graffiti into the wall of the boys bathroom and scrawls threatening quotes from Oedipus Rex on her blackboard. Cohen (xXx Alex Cross) goes for a garish low-rent exploitation look abrupt dolly-ins purple-lit streets and a couple of car-crash sequences that bring to mind his back-to-basics B-movie direction on the first The Fast And The Furious movie. This is all protect-the-nuclear-family stuff; Claire is being punished for considering divorce from her husband from whom shes been separated for nine months. (He had an affair with a secretary ""at the home office"" an indiscretion calculated for maximum Formica suburbanness.) But the thing about The Boy Next Door is that its so exaggerated and crammed with references to Greek tragedy--which start awkward and pretentious but become sublime around the point when someone gets an eye ripped out with an EpiPen--that it cant help but come across as parodic. Intentionally or not it plays like a fun loud parody of reactionary thrillers. And regardless big-screen releases this unabashedly trashy come once in a blue moon.

Photo Credit Universal Pictures advertisement | advertise on newsday Its a womans turn to think with her libido and pay the price in ""The Boy Next Door"" a thriller starring Jennifer Lopez as Claire Peterson a high-school teacher who sleeps with her 19-year-old neighbor Noah Sandborn (Ryan Guzman). Like many a man before her Claire hopes that her new sexual plaything can be quietly re-shelved. Noah however has other ideas. ""The Boy Next Door"" is rather obviously a gender-flipped version of ""Fatal Attraction"" the 1987 classic about an extramarital fling that turns into a nightmare. The genius of that movie with its narcissistic male hero and home-wrecking female villain was its ability to push both genders most sensitive buttons. ""The Boy Next Door"" written by Barbara Curry deserves credit for telling the same story through a womans eyes but it isnt nearly as daring or discomfiting as it could be. advertisement | advertise on newsday It is however trashy good fun and impressively steamy. The characters are pure sexual fantasy Claire the older woman whose bombshell body has gone too long untouched and Noah the young Adonis with the glistening biceps. (Neither actor is stretching much but they both look terrific.) After much flirtation and bedroom-window exhibitionism the two finally collide on a dark and stormy night. This teen sure knows his way around a womans body as the roving camera makes abundantly clear. More movie reviewsLatest movie reviews For a movie about transgression ""The Boy Next Door"" builds in too many excuses for its heroine. Claire is divorcing her unfaithful husband (John Corbett) and instantly regrets sleeping with Noah -- who by the way is not underage or technically her student as school has yet to begin. (Kristin Chenoweth plays Claires saucy vice principal Vicki Lansing.) Still Claires error is grave enough that we share her panic as Noah becomes increasingly violent and even begins turning Claires impressionable son Kevin (Ian Nelson) against her. ""The Boy Next Door"" isnt as campy or crazy as it could be -- theres nothing even approaching that boiled rabbit in ""Fatal Attraction"" -- but director Rob Cohen (""The Fast and the Furious"") employs smart camera work and adds a dollop of gore to spice things up. If nothing else ""The Boy Next Door"" is a guilty pleasure.

Can you blame the boy next door for wanting more than long chats about meaning and metaphor in The Iliad? Especially if that boy (Ryan Guzman) is a transfer student whos ""almost 20"" (also his approximate number of abs) and a bona fide psychopath. After their one sexual encounter--""Her mistake. His obsession"" pants the posters breathless tagline--his crush spins quickly into a murderous fixation. A few deliciously bonkers bons mots dot the Lifetime-grade dialogue and Lopez is game enough. But Boys premise reeks of stalker-movie mothballs and its too timid to fully dive into the high camp it hints at. Instead this cookie just crumbles.

A throwback to such racy but scolding Adrian Lyne movies as ""Unfaithful"" and ""Indecent Proposal"" ""The Boy Next Door"" returns the mainstream erotic thriller to the multiplex but its thin T-shirts and thinner characterizations fail to make a convincing case for the genres resurrection. Directed by Rob Cohen (""Alex Cross"" ""The Fast and the Furious"") ""The Boy Next Door"" is a comeback vehicle for star Jennifer Lopez as well. Repackaged here as the ultimate MILF -- a goddess of the hearth who never shows anything less than grace to her teenage son (Ian Nelson) her amiable but unfaithful ex-husband (John Corbett) and her overly chatty best friend (Kristin Chenowith) -- Lopez is far and away the best thing about the film not that she has any rivals for that title. Shes alert and open and whatever brand of virgin blood shes been drinking lately to halt aging its clearly working. Also Read Jennifer Lopezs Butt Isnt Big Enough to Give Jimmy Fallon a Clue in Tonight Show Game (Video) If only Cohen were as generous to Lopezs character Claire Peterson as he is to his lead actress. Theres no getting around the fact that Claire is kind of a moron; the high-school English teacher defends studying literature because it helped J.K. Rowling become a billionaire and coos over the ""first edition"" of Homers ""The Iliad"" that her 19-year-old hardbody neighbor Noah (Ryan Guzman ""Step Up Revolution"") brings her. When Noah starts stalking her in earnest after their wine-fueled one-night stand -- hacking into her emails sexually humiliating her at work threatening that hell never let her go -- she takes way too long to tell anyone about it. As Noah fuels his scorned rage into escalating acts of violence the thriller becomes less about how much havoc this purple-faced psychopath can wreak and more about when the hell the script is going to allow Claire to call the damn police already. Also Read Jennifer Lopez Doesnt Like the Term Cougar Denies Dating Co-Star Ryan Guzman (Video) Its also hard to be on Claires side pretty much a genre requirement in a victimization tale like this when the camera so rarely is. Despite a sidelong glance at Guzmans behind the ass-ploitative nature of ""The Boy Next Door"" mostly focuses on Lopez herself a decision that robs the film of the symbiosis of fear and attraction that makes the erotic thriller such escapist fun. Noahs image of himself as a romantic ""hero"" combined with his dirty white T-shirt suggests an oblique critique of the Ryan Gosling desperado mystique in ""The Notebook"" and ""Drive."" But if thats Cohen and screenwriter Barbara Currys intent Noahs explanatory backstory is too incoherent to satisfyingly land any argument about male obsession and control.

The high school English teacher played by Jennifer Lopez is dazzled by a gift from the handsome student (Ryan Guzman) whos moved in one house over a gilt-edged copy of The Iliad dating from what looks like the late 1800s. Lopez gushes ""A first edition"" A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - I had to wipe away a laugh-tear but Ill give screenwriter Barbara Curry the benefit of the doubt. Teacher Lopez seems once to have been a classics major and she specializes in Homer so maybe she means that this is a first edition of one particular translation of this ancient poem. On this issue Im willing to teach the controversy.Too bad that scenes so much more bonkers than the one in which the neighbor boy finally treats her to another oral epic. Steel yourself for shuddering breaths flashes of bra carefully framed glimpses of the top of Guzmans ass and what is for me a new one Heres the first erotic thriller I can think of that gets around the issue of the starlets no-nudity clause by just putting the mans hands on her breasts shot after shot -- he touches them not like hes enjoying them but like theyre the lenses of some damned paparazzos camera.Film Details The Boy Next Door RatingR GenreSuspense/Thriller Running Time91 More Info Trailer Thats a fine solution in the scene itself but its hilarious later when the neighbor boy goes full Fatal Attraction and tapes up printouts of a photo of that hookup all over Teacher Lopezs classroom. Amazingly even when hes trying to destroy her family/career with public revenge-porn the villain is still gentleman enough to select a shot where hes giving her a demure hand-bra. (The actual female nudity falls to a below-the-title up-and-comer and was probably instrumental in getting the movie financed.)So much of The Boy Next Door is hilarious. Lopez plays a pie-baking mom cuckolded by a husband who finds that Lopez Western cultures living embodiment of sexiness just isnt woman enough. Separated and unconfident she mopes in filmy nightshirts in some science-fiction suburb that seems to have banned window blinds. Sometimes she peeps at that neighbor boy a peak-level man-hunk whose abs you could sharpen knives against -- and whom the movie endearingly asks us to pretend looks young enough to be one of her students.That boy turns out to be a monster of course. He worms his way into her life and family proving himself good with garage doors and alternators befriending her bullied son and making her feel like a woman again which is the hardest bit to fathom How could the consciousness that pilots and maintains the body of Jennifer Lopez ever forget?No one could buy the gorgeous charismatic Guzman as an angry schoolkid revenging himself against a world of ""whores"" who reject him -- hes like the projected self-image of one of those GamerGate bros. And even Kristin Chenoweth cant believe herself as Teacher Lopezs bestie and her schools assistant principal but shes funny in the role giving the creaky old plot beats just the right amount of side-eye.But the movies not built for belief. Its built for dumb shivery sexed-up pleasure and it delivers albeit somewhat modestly. Heres a supremely attractive cast running through well-executed scenarios of seduction and terror with a script thats smart about its genres stupidities The neighbor boys crackpot speeches about the inconstancy of women feel of the cultural moment in a way the harpy misogyny of Glenn Closes assaults on Michael Douglas never did.What matters most though is that this is the rare by-the-numbers studio thriller that at least gets the numbers right. The twists stirred laughs at my screening Oh shit hes in the house Occasionally director Rob Cohens filmmaking is inspired such as the long shot where Lopez in the kitchen prepares drinks for her son and husband who are sitting on the couch with Guzman all visible in the top left corner of the screen far behind her. The boys watch TV happy and glazed over while Lopez in the foreground her face knotting up hides her terror in domestic duty.Wolfish Guzman plays wittily upon our fears of the underdeveloped empathy of overdeveloped young men. Built like Tatum but smiling like a shifty Franco he smears the distinction between Boy Scout and alpha sociopath. Lopez is much better at panic and fiery resolve than she is at ennui. As the neighbor boy at last lashes out Lopez comes to life transforming from a distractingly miscast actress to effectively vengeful movie star. Once it stops asking you to believe Lopez as an everyday person the movie becomes just what it should be expertly crafted nonsense that brushes up against a truth or two.

Director Rob Cohen is an old hand at straightforward genre product with a career that stretches from ""Miami Vice"" to ""The Fast and the Furious"" and he helms the Jennifer Lopez starrer ""The Boy Next Door"" with the passionless precision of a filmmaker who knows the territory. That might not sound like a fatal flaw but frankly a hack might almost have been preferable here injecting this silly somnambulant thriller script about a schoolteacher who falls for a psychotic teenager with some sort of panache distinction or perversion or even some kind of memorable incompetence to liven up its assembly-line paces. January releases dont get much more January than this but given its reported 4 million budget ""The Boy Next Door"" shouldnt have too much trouble finding its way into the black. Lopez stars as Claire Peterson a San Fernando Valley high-school teacher who has recently separated from her philandering husband Garrett (John Corbett). Though you wouldnt know it from the flawless makeup and runway-ready wardrobe she wears while grading papers in her mini-mansion Claire is feeling lost and lonely and struggling to raise her nebbishy teenage son Kevin (Ian Nelson) alone. Help arrives in the form of hulking ingratiating Noah (Ryan Guzman) whose bulging biceps appear onscreen several seconds before his face does. A 19-year-old San Bernardino transplant Noah has just moved in next door to help care for his ailing uncle and in spite of some vague references to an ""accident"" in his past he manages to effortlessly wedge himself into Claires life over the course of about five minutes fixing her car and garage door showing up for dinner and helping Kevin gain the confidence to talk to the neighborhood hottie. (Needless to say in addition to his expertise with auto repair hes also a skilled computer hacker and a kickboxer who can quote long passages of ""The Iliad"" from memory.) When Kevin leaves for a weekend camping trip the inevitable transpires and Claire gets hot and heavy with the titular next-door boy. No sooner has she attempted the next mornings walk of shame however than Noah turns on a dime into an obsessive stalker appearing unannounced at her home and somehow getting a seat in her high-school literature class. The films initial formulaic competence gives way to outright preposterousness rather quickly hinging on idiot-plot character motivations ""It was only a cat"" jump scares and computer files that may as well be labeled ""Evil Schemes 2012-2014."" Perhaps most fatally the screenplay (by first-timer Barbara Curry) never bothers to question the nature of Noahs madness leaving the underprepared ""Step Up"" veteran Guzman adrift in a pivotal role. It doesnt help that his attempts at smirking unhinged malevolence are more Ace Ventura than Norman Bates nor that hes clearly a decade older than some of the actors playing his schoolmates but he has precious little to go on. For its budget ""The Boy Next Door"" looks decently polished and Cohen stages one runaway car chase scene with the kind of kineticism that suggests hes aching for another go at the ""Fast"" franchise.

Dave RObertson says January 24 2015 at 1116 am Went and saw the chick flick movie w/my wife (being the good husband) and was riveted throughout with suspense. Here begins an aging gal (Jennifer) who obviously takes care of herself while her other aging friend (vice principal) uses silicon and botox. My take on this (and left me wondering if the director herself- Jennifer) isnt telling about her own life. A sexually-frustrated and harsh female who has 1 child (by accident no doubt) while her husband cheats with at least 1 other woman to he can get some cookies as it seems he didnt with his wife. Jennifer (Claire) feels totally guilty for having sex with Val Kilmer next door and must prove at the end that shes a bigger-man than he her husband and her son all put together. A Victim throughout the entire movie Jennifer has solidified herself in my mind as self-absorbed and dull personally. I first got a clue with her in Selena having been a fan of the real Selena- there was such a stark contrast in those 2 personalities. Ryan Guzman becomes pretty lame-brained after starting out so suave and really only Jennifer really is able to fight the monster despite her own monster insecurities. Guzman was convienently just over legal age for the movie and the blonde cheerleader-type chick in the movie was somewhat hot- both she and Ryan obviously of college age and not high-school age as shown for the flick.

Secondlysince I am a member of North Americas most ignored group-a cover boy handsomegenius-level intelligent older black chap (Valeisawho was the last studlybrainy black man did you see depicted in the theatreson TV or even in commercials?)Im considering writing a screen play about a telegenic65-70-year-old black man who moves next door to a buxom blonde in her late 20s or 30s. She rejects him because of his race and agebut then she becomes slowly smitten with himand they become lovers.(She realized he quite the studMUCH MORE than ever her age-mate boyfriends.) Of courseHollywood would reject such a scriptbecause I dont fall into their black male stereotypes-de-sexed sidekick to the white star/stud;intellectually impaired and/or criminal pity/opprobrium object andsince its the 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Movements successful culminationa long-suffering rather than heroically handsome black manthe sort who permits Tinseltown to salve it conscience while retaining the lead roles for white dudes.What say youValeisa? Reply Valeisa says January 23 2015 at 507 am I was just wondering; preview/trailer for Boy next Door with Jennifer Lopez was just on and with all the issues with child molestation and teachers having sex with children they want us to view this as her being a victim and him as crazy. Its she the adult here? Just My Opinion Im Just Saying. Ill pass Reply Chelsi says January 22 2015 at 802 pm I will be the first one on line to see the boy next door Jennifer is one of the hardest working women in the business. This movie will do well Haters need to get a life Reply crookedmindframe says January 22 2015 at 214 am I hear this film sits in the ""so bad its good"" variety. Which is right up my alley. Reply Sandra says January 21 2015 at 634 pm It sounds like a silly movie and it will flop like anything Lopez has done in the past ten years. She is a terrible actress and nobody cares for her movies Reply abc says January 21 2015 at 1222 pm Guzmans twink body frame aside the ""one decade only"" fact makes this whole exercise a wasted effort. See it for the eye candy that it is and shower afterward. J Lo is no giant as an actress to begin with but even she should demand better. Reply Joe says January 21 2015 at 1220 pm A reported 4 million budget JLo days of making millions have seen to have faded away along with her less acting talent and age Reply macd says January 21 2015 at 329 pm J Lo may not be the worlds greatest actress (who is?) but shes a very savvy businesswoman. ""Boy Next Door"" will make back its micro-budget and be in the black by next Monday and as one of its producers Jenny From the Block will pocket millions by the time this piece of cheese runs its course. Shes been promoting the hell out of this movie and more power to her. While Johnny Depps latest flop will cement his standing as Box Office Poison J Lo will be laughing her way to the bank. Reply Find A New Agent Jennifer says January 21 2015 at 1036 am The tv ads Ive repeatedly seen for this pretty much give the entire plotline away. So why on Earth would anyone want to plonk down 10 or 12 bucks to see it in theatres? Totally generic. Reply marie says January 21 2015 at 443 pm Thanknyou Reply joan says January 21 2015 at 1003 am Does anyone notice that she plays a teacher in this movie and has srx woth one of her students people whats up with this last i saw they get arrested for that anyway most of het movies suck sorry go back to singing Reply Guest says January 21 2015 at 444 pm Your grammar and spelling suck as well. Reply cadavra says January 21 2015 at 957 am 4 million budget? Are you actually telling us J-Lo worked for scale? Reply TONY says January 21 2015 at 931 am UGH...are you kidding me? Trash. J-Lo go retire somewhere.

No good adulterous affair goes unpunished in Hollywood movies. The latest proof is J.Lo starrer The Boy Next Door a gender-reversing B-movie spin on Fatal Attraction that sets suburban family values against that one night of misguided irresistible passion. An economically told popcorn pic built from horror-movie tropes the film stars Jennifer Lopez and Ryan Guzman as respectively the worlds most glamorous high school teacher and its oldest 19-year-old. As counterprogramming to awards-focused prestige titles it offers January moviegoers some guilty-pleasure thrills and laughs while falling way short of its potential on both the dramatic and the camp fronts. Still given the star power and the lurid material the wide release is sure to score at the box office. Read more Jennifer Lopez on Casting Latinos in The Boy Next Door ""Thats Gonna Change Things"" Set in an unidentified section of SoCals Inland Empire the movie finds literature teacher Claire Peterson (Lopez) separated from her husband for almost a year but not quite ready to move on however much her best friend/sassy vice principal (Kristin Chenoweth) urges her to do so. Played with typical nice-guy earnestness by John Corbett repentant cheating husband Garrett is eager for a second chance with Claire. Soon enough somebody else wants a second chance with her too -- but hes not asking. Before he reveals his predatory stripes Noah (Guzman of the series Pretty Little Liars and the Step Up franchise) arrives on the scene as a fix-it hero of a new neighbor offering such incontestable wisdom as ""Its the clutch."" Nobody (other than the audience) pays much attention to the unlikely high-school seniors murmured references to dead parents and an accident. Transferring his know-how from the driveway to the bedroom Noah gives Claire a night to remember. Her quickness the morning after to label their steamy get-together as a mistake proves a major mistake it itself when dealing with Noah who invests a whole lotta menace in the supposed compliment ""A woman like you should be cherished."" Have more threatening words ever been spoken? Her instant guilt coupled with his instant wacko routine deprives the film of any real sense of naughty indulgence not to mention nuance. But director Rob Cohen avoids sex-scene cliches and gives the encounter and much of what follows energy. Once Claire distances herself its ""game on"" for studly and strategic Noah whose first step is to take Claires good-natured but timid teenage son Kevin (well played by Ian Nelson) under his wing and poison him against his father. See more The Boy Next Door Trailer Jennifer Lopez Regrets Sleeping With a Student Noah quickly turns into a one-note character -- the note being ""pathological."" In Lopezs rootable portrayal Claire is far more complex conflicted about her marriage capable of walking out on a disastrous blind date and alive to the possibilities that her handsome young neighbor initially represents especially when viewed late at night across their rain-streaked bedroom windows. The screenplay by prosecutor-turned-screenwriter Barbara Curry lays out some heavy-handed background to explain Noahs derangements and fixations but everything gives way to full-tilt lunacy leading to an inevitable showdown complete with dont-go-into-the-basement suspense flat-out torture and implausible heroics. Though the script settles into ordinary thriller territory way too soon Cohen (The Fast and the Furious Alex Cross) doesnt belabor things delivering a concise and good-looking genre piece and making the most of a microbudget (4 million). In the earthy interiors of Claires home Charles Vargas production design accentuates her maternal warmth. The excellent score by Rand Edelman and Nathan Barr ratchets up the dread. If only that high-tension music played against less obvious action and dialogue. Everything is signaled clearly in Boy A gun appears early in the story as does a kitchen knife pointing to dire circumstances ahead. But at least as disappointing as the films predictability is the way the cheesy giddy double entendres of its early scenes give way all too readily to the business of protecting professional reputations and the sanctity of the nuclear family -- not half as much fun.
