Dimension Films hide caption toggle caption Dimension Films Rough Customer Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell) smokes the road. Dimension Films Watch a Death-Proof Clip Souped-up hot rods buckets of gore sexpots car chases zombies with exploding pustules -- I mean seriously whats not to love? Who could resist a movie where the leading lady loses a leg in an attack of the living dead and her boyfriend replaces it with the perfect B-movie accessory a snap-on lock-n-load prosthetic machine-gun. Welcome to Planet Terror a spoof of zombie gross-outs in which director Robert Rodriguez has fun overstating what you might call the essentials of the living-dead genre carnage cannibalism and cleavage. Here and there the director also adds innovations of his own. (I dont recall another zombie movie featuring melting genitalia for instance.) And what filmmakers can do with body fluids in an age of digital manipulation goes way beyond the spattered-ketchup school of filmmaking. Doesnt sound like your cup of bile? Well...its admittedly not for the faint of heart or of stomach. But how do you feel about car chases? Theyre the draw in the second half of the Grindhouse double bill. Actually the second half of the second half because Quentin Tarantinos car- and babe-crazed epic Death-Proof starts off with some seriously extended talk filmed in seriously extended takes. Its Tarantino showing off both in the dialogue and in the camerawork in ways that the no-budget movies to which hes paying homage generally didnt. But never mind that. Eventually some doomed young beauty is bound to forget she shouldnt accept rides from strangers and get into Stuntman Mikes supercharged Dodge. This is lets note Tarantino spoofing Tarantino movies not films youd have seen on a double bill decades ago but hey its energetic. And it sets up -- after a second bout of chatter with a second set of gorgeous young women -- what is maybe the most rip-roaring chase ever captured on film. Its a chase youre free to enjoy just as a thrill ride or for its ""cinematic"" virtues -- swooping continuous shots where cars disappear and erupt from clouds of dust white-knuckle stunt work thats clearly not being digitally faked and so on. Now to make this movie experience resemble what youd have gotten in a real grind house both halves of the double feature have been carefully marred with deep film scratches broken sprocket holes and even missing reels. (The sex scenes naturally which in the old days might well have gone missing off in some projectionists private collection.) No doubt theyll be on the DVD version. Theres talk that when Grindhouse is released overseas itll be as two separate films and at that point each will have more material. Might work there but together at three-plus hours including real ""period"" popcorn ads and interstitials plus hilarious fake previews created by prominent young horror directors Grindhouse is a bit too much of a good thing. If each of its films were shortened by 15 minutes the overall package would be stronger. But its hard to argue with filmmakers who are so in love with such disreputable subject matter --so in love that they just cant bear to let it go.

Thus a go-go dancers leg goes missing during a zombie attack and the action is occasionally interrupted by title cards that proclaim ""Missing Reel."" (That touch is more affectionate than factual since projectionists and sleazy distributors of the slasher/horror genre didnt brag about such omissions.) Little else seems to be missing from this work of wild-eyed archaeology -- not the slime or drool spurting blood throbbing engines screeching tires or jeopardized women. Yet value has been added as well -- the most thrilling car chase ever committed to film a sequence that also shows by cutting to the psychosexual chase why fans embraced the tawdry genre in the first place. ENLARGE The whole thing runs a bit over three hours goes by swiftly contains countless film references and includes hilarious fake trailers. The first half of the program ""Planet Terror"" is set in a small Texas town where zombies have been spawned by a chemical experiment gone awry. Mr. Rodriguez wore all the hats -- wrote directed produced shot and edited -- just as he had done on a 7000 budget for his 1993 debut feature ""El Mariachi."" But this like its companion piece is far from a low-rent affair -- its only made to resemble one with simulated scratches. Unless youre partial to pustules needle sticks and necrotizing lesions youll find plenty of dull spots in the elaborately choreographed loathsomeness. At the same time though ""Planet Terror"" is enlivened -- and bedeathened -- by the bizarro husband-and-wife doctors played by Josh Brolin and Marley Shelton; by Freddy Rodriguezs Wray a mythic loner descended from Zorro by way of spaghetti Westerns; and especially by Rose McGowans Cherry the dancer whose munched-off limb is replaced first by a table leg and then by a machine gun. As heroines go Cherry is in a class by herself and a grind house emblem straight out of Krafft-Ebbing -- a beautiful babe whos both maimed and all-powerful. Quentin Tarantinos film ""Death Proof"" is much the superior of the two a high-speed hybrid that juxtaposes comedy jeopardy a psycho killer and an action climax of remarkable emotional intensity. (The writer-director also served as cinematographer.) Unlike Mr. Tarantinos convoluted ""Pulp Fiction"" this shortish film has a linear plot thats easy to convey -- so easy that Ill pass on conveying it for fear of spoiling the grisly fun. Suffice it to say that the story starts in an Austin restaurant where three attractive young women are making sweet music out of casual conversation. (No kidding; the flow of language is at once musical and intricately feminine.) The psycho killer Stuntman Mike -- hes played with malign brio by Kurt Russell -- sits watching them at the bar while Mikes lethal weapon his muscle car sits waiting on the street. ENLARGE Sydney Tamiia Poitier (left) in Grindhouse More than one chase ensues and more women become involved. One of them is played by a real-life stuntwoman from New Zealand Zoe Bell -- she was Uma Thurmans stunt double in both volumes of ""Kill Bill."" Her stunts look too preposterously dangerous to be real but none of the action is fake. Neither in the end are the nuclear explosions of rage and revenge that make Thelma and Louise look like rogue Girl Scouts. Real feelings such as those fueled the grind house furnace. The Hoax Truth takes a holiday in ""The Hoax."" This study of world-class mendacity stars Richard Gere as Clifford Irving the writer who in the 1970s faked an authorized biography of Howard Hughes. Mendacity hardly hints at Irvings M.O. He embroidered on an epic scale told ever bigger lies with ever more indignant conviction about his access to the reclusive billionaire. Mr. Gere an actor with a quick wit and a nimble mind gets at this sociopath energy wonderfully well so in one sense my first sentence is a lie -- his portrait feels essentially true. Yet Mr. Gere is also a movie star of uncommon charm and he makes his subject much more dynamic than Irving has seemed to be in public -- in a ""60 Minutes"" interview for instance thats included in the DVD set of Orson Welless ""F for Fake."" Its a good thing he does. Whether or not the truth always outs we dont always need it to. ENLARGE Richard Gere in The Hoax At least half of ""The Hoax"" is a giddy pleasure. The director Lasse Hallstrom must have been as high on the storys savor -- the period details the workings of the publishing industry -- as Clifford Irving was on his own cockeyed enterprise. (William Wheeler adapted Irvings book of the same name.) Its fascinating to watch the perfervid Irving trying to channel Howard Hughes as he writes his bogus bio. Marcia Gay Harden channels Shelley Winters as Irvings wife and Alfred Molina is sensationally funny as Irvings co-conspirator and Sancho Panza Dick Susskind; that almost amounts to a co-starring performance official credits notwithstanding. But the narrative engine leaves the rails when Irving like Hughes plunges into paranoia (though Irving actually is the object of a high-level plot) and the style turns to the sort of intensely manipulated surrealism that Charlie Kaufman practiced not successfully in ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind."" If truth be told this story works best when its allowed to tell itself. Black Book Like it or not and I like it a lot ""Black Book"" -- made in the Netherlands mainly in Dutch and German -- functions as a kind of anti-Anne Frank. Thats not to say Paul Verhoevens film is anti-Semitic. To the contrary its valiant heroine is Jewish a former cabaret singer and current drop-dead beauty named Rachel Stein (Carice van Houten) whos been living in a hidden room with a gentile family in rural Holland during World War II. But ""Black Book"" is serious about its subject in some startlingly unserious ways. Once Rachel is forced to leave her hiding place she dyes her hair starts calling herself Ellis de Vries and attains as a Resistance fighter a level of erotically infused heroism usually reserved for mainstream action thrillers. (Mr. Verhoevens previous work in that stream includes ""RoboCop"" ""Total Recall"" ""Basic Instinct"" and ""Showgirls."") And Rachel is no more an angel than the Nazi officer she falls for is a devil. (Hes played magnetically by Sebastian Koch who was the admirable East German writer in ""The Lives of Others."") ""Black Book"" is its own kind of thriller. The film is filled with the genres conventions -- suspense betrayal melodrama violence music -- and its hugely enjoyable from start to finish. (Ms. Van Houtens fire and beauty reminded me of the young Helen Mirren; shes a certified star.) Yet the script which Gerald Soeteman wrote with the director finds time to deal with Dutch collaborationists to suggest the shades of virtue and vice that colored Hollands Resistance and to dramatize the chaos that accompanied the Liberation. As if that werent enough a preface and coda provide a reminder of what Israels sanctuary meant to Europes Jews. Not so shabby for commercial entertainment. Killer of Sheep Thank goodness Milestone Film amp; Video with some help from generous friends has made it possible for movie lovers to see first in theaters and soon on DVD a seminal American feature thats been all but invisible until recently. Charles Burnett shot ""Killer of Sheep"" in 16 mm black and white as his thesis film when he was a graduate student at UCLA in the 1970s. Though it won festival awards and was declared a national treasure by the Library of Congress (the National Society of Film Critics called it one of the 100 essential films of all time) the movie rarely showed in public partly because of poor print quality and partly because of legal problems involving music rights. Those problems have finally been solved and the film meticulously restored looks -- and sounds -- lovely in a 35 mm blowup. So what does it turn out to be after all these years? A delicately poetic essentially plotless vision unblinking but not unhopeful of life in Watts where little but the ghettos name recognition had changed a decade after the riots. Children play -- are they the sheep and poverty the killer? -- while grown-ups strive scheme and dream. Ill discuss this singular film in detail when the DVD is released in the fall but for now please seek it out if its playing in a theater anywhere near you. Theres more than enough beauty to fill the big screen.

"A B-movie blast - Mercury News Entertainment Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeA B-movie blastA-LIST DIRECTORS CRAFT AN OVER-THE-TOP TRIBUTE TO RACY MOVIES OF YESTERYEARBy Bruce NewmanMercury NewsPosted 04/05/2007 011636 PM PDTUpdated 04/05/2007 021534 PM PDT""Grindhouse"" is a funhouse a weaponized adrenaline rush. Its a genre joyride through the exploitation movies of the 70s one that swerves recklessly toward overkill every chance it gets before finally letting you out exhausted and exhilarated somewhere around the Nixon administration. More a state of mind than a film ""Grindhouse"" is a sort of conceptual container for the hell-on-wheels double-feature that B-movie fanboys Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino have created. ""Planet Terror"" Rodriguezs zombie-splatter spectacular and ""Death Proof"" Tarantinos muscle-car revenge fantasia are sick and twisted in the best sense. The boys just wanna have fun. The warp and pop of the film stock; the scratches that pour like a rainstorm through the entire 191 minutes of ""Grindhouse""; the fake coming attractions for movies such as ""Machete"" about an illegal immigrant hitman and his sidekick a shotgun-packing priest; seemingly even the sticky spot on the floor beneath your seat - all of it has been put there by Rodriguez and Tarantino trying to simulate a movie-going experience that you probably would have avoided when it actually existed. ""Planet Terror"" and to a lesser extent ""Death Proof"" embrace the ethos of B movies. But its not as if Tarantino and Rodriguez have been restrained limiting themselves to the kinds of budgets and halfway-house actors the original exploitation moviemakers had to work with.Advertisement ""Grindhouse"" is to those original splatter films what Restoration Hardware is to yard sale furniture not exactly real but probably a whole lot better than real ever was. The problem that afflicts both pictures is one of verve not nerve. At their best Rodriguez and Tarantino set a blistering pace for action and dialogue alike. But ""Planet Terror"" hits several dead spots in inexplicable interludes of character development and ""Death Proof"" nearly talks itself to death before Tarantino finally hits the gas. In ""Planet Terror"" Cherry Darling (Rose McGowan) is a go-go dancer whose dream of becoming a stand-up comedian is left cruelly lopsided when zombies gnaw off one of her legs. She ends up in the same hospital emergency room as a guy with an abscessed tongue that has turned black and begun erupting in the direction of Dr. William Block (Josh Brolin whos beginning to look more like Nick Nolte with each passing role). Soon people with exploding facial boils and glassy eyes are everywhere and Cherrys ex-boyfriend Wray (Freddy Rodriguez) decides they had better get out of there. Fortunately he morphs instantly from sad sack to master kung fu fighter and Cherry hops along behind him on a peg leg made from a broom handle. Wray is watching her back and pretty soon hes watching her front too. If this were authentic sexploitation we would also be watching as Cherry makes love like theres no tomorrow. But the director has spliced in a MISSING REEL announcement simulating the period thievery of grindhouse projectionists instead of the sex. I shake my fist at you Rodriguez Just about everything in ""Planet Terror"" feels like a drawn-out prelude to the moment when Wray attaches a machine gun to Cherrys stump giving her a prosthetic leg that is literally smokin. And whats not to like about a movie in which the leading lady has a Gatling-gun gam that turns her into a bullet-blazing pinwheel? ""Death Proof"" which doesnt begin until nearly two hours into the ""Grindhouse"" experience starts with one of Tarantinos trademark dialogue blocks although in this case it serves as a roadblock. Jungle Julia an Austin radio DJ (played by Sydney Tamiia Poitier) goes out for a night of drinking with her foxy posse which includes friends Shanna and Butterfly (Jordan Ladd and Vanessa Ferlito). At a bar they meet Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell as you might remember him in ""Escape From New York"") but brush him off. Another young woman (McGowan again but blond this time) accepts Mikes offer of a ride home but along the way she and the others learn that his ""death-proof"" stunt car is safe only if youre sitting in Mikes seat behind the wheel. Theres some carnage that would be unfair to describe here then another group of young women appears (this one featuring Rosario Dawson Tracie Thoms Zoe Bell and Mary Elizabeth Winstead). This is followed by a lot more talking. Tarantino has frequently managed to pull these gabfests off as he did with John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson in ""Pulp Fiction"" so that it ends up being the thing you remember most about the movie. But not this time. The talking delays the inevitable car chase which is great wicked fun when it finally arrives. Bell who plays herself here after serving as Uma Thurmans stuntwoman in Tarantinos ""Kill Bill"" movies does some amazing stunt work on the outside of a revved-up 1970 Dodge Challenger. Both the driving and the hanging on in this sequence put to shame the computer-generated cop-outs of most current action pictures. Even the chase has its shortcomings however including the head-scratching refusal by the driver of the chick-mobile to simply hit the brakes when that would be the smart thing to do. Smart for her but maybe not so much for us. And with this rip-roaring hot rod of a movie Tarantino and Rodriguez have burned rubber in a way that the summer movies must now take aim at.

Others called them a blast. These omnipotent fantasies for the powerless provided a junk-food high in the junkiest imaginable of settings. Americas most gifted filmmakers got their starts with such zombie mashups death races and soft-core porn. David Cronenbergs They Came From Within. Steven Spielbergs Duel. Jonathan Demmes Caged Heat. Martin Scorseses Boxcar Bertha was that unusual grindhouse hybrid a soft-core/religio/protest pic. Grindhouse is the specific name of the double bill of ""Planet Terror"" by Robert Rodriguez and ""Death Proof"" by Quentin Tarantino a stunt calculated to simulate (and celebrate) scratched negatives bad splices and triple-D titillation. Its two two two flicks in one with a running time of over three hours. Their exhaustive tribute to hungry zombies fast girls and faster cars is . . . exhausting if intermittently entertaining. Especially when Rodriguez is behind the camera or when the trailers for nonexistent movies like ""Machete"" are teased. Rodriguez ""Planet Terror"" (which gets 21/2 stars) is a ballet of blood beasts and breasts; Tarantinos ""Death Proof"" (2 stars) is a rock opera of chrome creeps and crashes. In overall design the films pair well as Rodriguezs is oozy and nocturnal Tarantinos high-octane in harsh daylight. But this is a mixed bag a double bill for film omnivores with a high tolerance for gore and blood and sadism. ""Planet Terror"" is a barbecue-flavored celebration of Night of the Living Dead Motel Hell and They Came From Within populated with secret Sapphists gun-crazy car mechanics and ol boy cops united against flesh-eating zombies and the mad scientists who made them that way. ""Death Proof"" is essentially a Tarantino movie interminable girltalk (courtesy of the wonderful Rosario Dawson and hilarious ZoA<< Bell) with a high-speed finale. It name-checks Vanishing Point about a billion times but it struck me as a chatty nod to Russ Meyers Faster Pussycat Kill Kill Rodriguez and Tarantino fulfill the first two of the three principal attractions of grindhouse fare. Grindhouse flicks are made so quickly that they were the movie equivalent of automatic writing - pure unfiltered id. They enable a woman to navigate the male unconscious (except for Stephanie Rothman exploitation-filmmakers were male) and grapple with the contradiction that the female power made flesh was an embodiment both of male fantasy as well as fear. Their nonstop sensation left viewers as giddy as if theyd swallowed a controlled substance. RR and QT do an excellent job of simulating the content of grindhouse offerings but they dont simulate the experience or the giddy kick. Those all-night theaters reeking of Lysol and popcorn have gone the way of the TV dinner and todays audiences are too polite to join in the group groans and gropes and screaming at the screen that added to the ahem grindhouse gestalt. Why would successful filmmakers wax nostalgic for the grindhouse? These are the movies that turned them on the fare that made them want to make films. Film is the medium - projector malfunctions scratched celluloid mismatched edits and all - that inspired them. This is their wet kiss to the on-the-cheap filmmaking being replaced by digital photography and online editing.

BY Jack Mathewsdaily News Movie Critic Friday April 6 2007 400 AM View the photo gallery ""Grindhouse"" Two intentionally bad exploitation movies -- one hilarious one tedious -- by Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino. With Freddy Rodriguez Rose McGowan Kurt Russell Rosario Dawson. Directors Rodriguez Tarantino (311). R Language extreme violence drug use sexuality/nudity. At area theaters. The claim that the Robert Rodriguez/Quentin Tarantino two-film project ""Grindhouse"" is an homage to the Grade Z exploitation movies that played on the alternative urban theater circuit in the 60s and 70s is baloney. The people who made those movies did so with shoestring budgets and - despite their films relatively outrageous violence and sexuality - were still operating under the threat of censorship. Rodriguezs zombie film ""Planet Terror"" and Tarantinos road thriller ""Death Proof"" are products of this time when the hippest filmmakers can fake making campy B-movies with top production values and accomplished actors who can seem sincere even with tongue in cheek. And as members of Hollywoods political inner sanctum Rodriguez and Tarantino can get the goriest scenes past the MPAA with an R rating. Though both movies have the scratches flicker and ""missing reels"" of overcirculated prints they are prime grindhouse beef. Critics are largely agreeing Tarantinos story about a psychopathic stuntman who targets women for highway carnage is the better of the two. I disagree. With the exception of two sensational car chase sequences ""Death Proof"" is almost all dialogue among two groups of aggressive women unaware of the danger presented by the scar-faced hustler who calls himself ""Stuntman Mike"" (Kurt Russell). Granted this is not just any dialogue but home-brewed Tarantino espresso dialogue tough vulgar repartee that has given everything since ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" a special Q.T. kick. A little of that goes a long way for me and though I love Russells crazy performance ""Death Proof"" is a butt-numbing way to end a three hour-plus program. ""Planet Terror"" is nonstop zombie violence a comedy of gore that ratchets ""Shaun of the Dead"" up about 3000 ticks. A virus infects humans and victims are noticeable by soulless eyes and pulsating boils. Lined up against them are a military platoon headed by Bruce Willis a mysterious Rambo-like sharpshooter played by Freddy Rodriguez and his stripper girlfriend Cherry Darling (Rose McGowan) who loses a leg to a hungry zombie. There are many inspired moments but Cherrys amputation is the best. First she gets around hobbling on a sharp-ended stick affixed to her stump a handy weapon when a melting zombie played by Tarantino attempts to rape her. Then her boyfriend exchanges the remains of the stick with a machine gun ... and this babe knows what to do with it. The grindhouse elements are all here from lipstick lesbians to blunt-force trauma. With ""Planet Terror"" in particular youll choke on your laughter. Go I say and enjoy. jmathewsnydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Grindhouse is too much Tarantino Rodriguez 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Quentin Tarantino quipped that his Kill Bill movies gave us one film for the price of two but Grindhouse a fan-boy evocation of 70s exploitation flicks is two for the price of one. Maybe so but for entertainment purposes it would make more sense to divide Grindhouses self-contained double feature as will be done in Europe. Here a nonstop twin bill of Robert Rodriguezs Planet Terror and Tarantinos Death Proof stretches a meaty yet thin concept across epic length. And three-plus hours of zombies babes guns and gore should test the patience even of nostalgia-heads who share the directors unholy passions. Besides although Tarantino and Rodriguez are pals their films dont play well together. Zombie-plague action romp Planet Terror which opens sets the right tone by looking like its print went through too many bad drive-in projectors. Although shot digitally its doctored images are scratchy shaky and jumpy as if frames -- or entire reels -- are missing. But Tarantino cheats. His hot-rod story Death Proof looks polished. Even in content its not the sensationalized sick flick that Rodriguez delivered. Rather its mostly about women who sit and talk about getting kicks. Then they talk some more. A worshipful Tarantino writes pages of dialogue for them and its well played and shot. But its less about storytelling than self-indulgent stalling. Wheres the meat? Finally it arrives in a greasy wrapper as Death Proof morphs into a stalker thriller. Aging ex-stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell) has an unexplained grudge against such gals and after cajoling them at an Austin bar he lashes out on lonely roads with his battering-ram of a car. Death Proof itself has two parts. In the second Russell reappears in Tennessee to menace more women only they fight back -- big-time. As a bully drowning in his own medicine Russell is an amusing hysteric. But as a murderer I dont buy him. Far better are the crazy Marys and Zoes who turn the tables when Mike slams his stunt car into the supercharged vehicle theyre test-driving. As played by Rosario Dawson Tracie Thoms and real stunt driver Zoe Bell these fearless women go beyond the female empowerment of old slasher flicks in which a woman is sole survivor. They dont just cope -- they thrive on confrontation. But does their film evoke the 70s cheese honored by Rodriguez? Not really. Death Proof is even cell-phone fixated. Whats so 70s about that? At least Planet Terror looks like the sleazy potboilers ground out in narrow ""twin"" cinemas of old. And unlike Death Proof it gets busy and exploits. Freddy Rodriguez plays a stout bad boy wooing former flame Cherry (Rose McGowan) a go-go dancer. When her leg gets chomped off by zombies they bond in battle and after he fits her with a rapid-fire weapon below the knee her gonzo gunplay gives Grindhouse its best action payoffs. Planet Terrors game cast also has Marley Shelton and Josh Brolin as married physicians with trust issues and Bruce Willis and makeup maestro Tom Savini as renegade soldiers. Unlike Death Proof the film doesnt fudge on funny-scary cheap thrills and its seedy 70s vibe feels authentic. Pulsing through the same vein are mock trailers for nonexistent movies shown between features. If you love this sort of thing Rob Zombies Werewolf Women of the SS looks as good as it gets. Given a chance to fulfill such promise Grindhouse is a mixed-bag of a popcorn flick where more proves to be less. bruce.westbrookchron.com Todays Deals Gillette Silver Blue Razor Blades 100-Pack for 14 + free...

For those unfamiliar with the term to Dumpster dive means plunging into a huge garbage receptacle so you can recycle another mans trash as your own personal treasure. Yes the source material for this high-concept/ low-art supernova of a film event comes from the exploitation cinema of the late 60s and early 70s. Yet the back-to-back features ""Planet Terror"" and ""Death Proof"" actually are more akin to thrift shopping. Separated by a few years but fed on the same diet of junk and serious cinema Rodriguez and Tarantino fashion ""Planet Terror"" and ""Death Proof"" out of pop cultural remnants. Each makes the tattered material wildly weirdly his own. Rodriguez treads Roger Corman-George A. Romero territory with the story of a virus that makes infectious monsters of the locals. In the 350 horsepower ""Death Proof"" Tarantino speeds across the muscle-car black-top of movies like ""Vanishing Point"" and ""Gone in 60 Seconds."" Actor Freddy Rodriguez gives a gift of a performance as Wray in ""Planet Terror."" The veteran of HBOs ""Six Feet Under"" and one of the finer things about last years ""Bobby"" the diminutive actor is the finest embodiment yet of the Latino hero the ""El Mariachi"" has been searching for. He and Rose McGowan as go-go dancer Cherry Darling give the engorged heart of ""Planet Terror"" surprisingly romantic palpitations. Its quite a hat trick. After all our heroine has a piece of wood - then a gun - as a prosthetic limb. (Her leg was munched by zombies.) And our hero is one of those improbable killing machines typically found in Hong Kong cinema. Rodriguez and Tarantino have a talent for rehabbing actors or refreshing our appreciation of them. Casting Michael Biehn (""The Terminator"") and Jeffrey Fahey as brothers spurs contented smiles. Biehn plays the town sheriff. Fahey (""Lawnmower Man"") plays bro J.T. proprietor of a roadside BBQ joint. The Bone Shack is where the roughed-up survivors of the rampaging infected gather. Tarantinos great reclamation job Bruce Willis appears in ""Planet Terror"" as an Army officer. Naveen Andrews (""Lost"") plays the mercenary scientist who knows the epidemiology of the virus. He also has a thing about collecting testicles. No surprise - body parts are a staple of both movies. And there are plenty of suggestive shots of women in each. But make no mistake women are tail-kicking partners in ""Grindhouse."" McGowan is so vibrant as Cherry you might ask why she hasnt had a grander career. She does double duty in ""Grind- house"" appearing as a bleached- blond passenger in Stuntman Mikes ""death proofed"" Nova. Kurt Russell stars in Tarantinos ""Faster-psychopath Kill Kill"" contribution. Wearing a slash down his face and a race jacket with an ""ICY/HOT"" emblem Russell has too much fun playing Stuntman Mike the appealing/appalling former daredevil. Russell may be the star. But when a second quartet of women friends arrives after the ill-fated first he finds his onscreen matches. Tracie Thoms (""Cold Case"") and Kiwi stunt person Zoe Bell rock as Kim and Zoe two stunt people on a break with fellow movie-biz friends - makeup artist Abernathy (Rosario Dawson) and actress Lee (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). ""Death Proof"" may now own one of the most nerve-racking chases in movie history. As a black Challenger and a white Charger vie for Dodge supremacy the movie hurtles toward its revenge-is-good ending. ""Death Proof"" and ""Planet Terror"" both mimic to a T their predecessors. There are faux scratches in the ""Planet Terror"" print. The movie appears to jump projector sprockets at times. And it always has the low-budget haze and low-light murk of 70s horrorfests. ""Planet Terror"" is as willfully homely as Rodriguezs ""Sin City"" was luminous. Both filmmakers outdo Bertolt Brecht as they disrupt the flow of their tales with hilariously timed ""lost reel"" notifications from the theaters management. Movie palaces fallen on hard times were dubbed grindhouses because they exhibited exploitation feature after feature. Sucking the marrow of meaningfulness from the movies insider riffs may require some repeat viewings. But even wanting to get back on the ride when ""Grindhouse"" clocks in at 3 hours 11 minutes is its own declaration of success. ""Grindhouse"" is so meticulously crafted it comes with period-appropriate previews (or ""prevues"") that run at the start and in between the double-feature. The best featuring Cheech Marin and Danny Trejo winks at then body slams the current debate on immigration. ""Grindhouse"" romps on Andy Warhol territory. It is a full-on version of a pop-art undertaking in which B movies take the place of a can of tomato soup. Splatter soup? What do you call an outing that makes a gore joke of the phrase ""no brainer""? One might wonder such a thing while dreaming of climbing behind the wheel of your Chevy SS and peeling out of the Cinderella City Drive-in. One word however comes immediately to mind Fun.

By David Denby Rose McGowan as a pole-dancer turned vigilante in Rodriguezs ""Planet Terror.""   Credit YUKO SHIMIZU With the three-hour-and-eleven-minute ""Grindhouse"" the writer-directors Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez have put together an entire evenings entertainment devoted to the violent schlock movies and decrepit theatres that they loved as kids and never stopped loving. ""Grindhouse"" is a single film with no intermission but it includes two new features and such divertissements as trailers for ridiculous imaginary pictures (""Werewolf Women of the S.S."") ads for revolting food at local restaurants and artifacts of down-at-the-heels moviegoing from decades ago. At climactic moments in the two features--say just as the hero and the heroine are about to get it on--the scene sometimes comes to an abrupt halt and the words ""Missing reel"" flash on the screen. Now and then the movie develops hiccups as if frames had been chopped out--a tribute to needy projectionists of old who kept the images they liked best. And deep scratches as lovingly inscribed as the speckled antiquing on a blanket chest run through long stretches of film. The general intent here is to louse up the surface of the movie as much as possible and make that degraded surface in a kind of high-tech punk conceit a central part of the experience. Tarantino and Rodriguez are trying to re-create their memories of moviegoing as a blissfully sullied urban folk ritual in which sprawling teens squandered their time in seedy picture palaces. Why would such technically sophisticated filmmakers who have the power to do whatever they want make a movie like this? Because it amuses them and because the movie just might irritate the squares--the schoolteacherish elements in the audience who still believe that movies should be nice. And also perhaps to free themselves. Embracing trash is a way of not giving a damn about feelings or art or anything else except craft. Down there on the sticky floor of the theatre you can be as crazily violent or as sleazily erotic as you want. What surprises me I suppose is not the impulse itself--who hasnt in a foul mood felt something like it?--but the widespread notion in the press that Tarantino and Rodriguez have become moviemaking radicals. They havent genteel middlebrow culture lost its sway years ago and plenty of other filmmakers are doing hyper-violence and sleaze. Tarantino and Rodriguez arent going against the flow; theyre trying to get ahead of the flow. What theyd like of course is to bring to their version of trash that extra touch of madness which turns exploitation into wit. In the first of the two features ""Planet Terror"" Rodriguez the co-director of ""Sin City"" unleashes a plague on a small town in Texas. People who are infected become zombies that prey on the living. Or something like that. In any case this dawn-of-the-dead fantasia is gleefully disgusting flesh melts bodies explode like packages of liquid squeezed too hard testicles roll around on the ground like spilled Brussels sprouts. The slaughterhouse outrages combined with a complete absence of meaning are whats supposed to be cool about ""Planet Terror"" and the audience (largely young men) whoops and hollers on cue. I closed my eyes here and there and then opened them again looking for signs of irony. I found a few. Rodriguez did the cinematography himself and the camera occasionally loses interest in whats going on pausing to leer at an actresss cleavage. Continuity is intentionally spotty focus intermittent. Rose McGowan as the heroine Cherry a retired pole-dancer seems as entranced by her own sexual splendor as a ruby-lipped tomato on the cover of a Mickey Spillane novel. (Yes I know wrong period--but thats what she looks like.) When Cherry loses a leg to the ghouls her old lover (Freddy Rodriguez whos a pocket-size dynamo) outfits her with a machine gun for a stump; she raises it like a dog taking a pee and blows away anyone within fifty yards. Some of this flaming luridness is exciting but Rodriguez quickly becomes desperate. The movie is as repetitive as hell and despite his continual attempts to raise the ante quite boring. At a certain point of course a loving re-creation of something tawdry isnt all that different from the original. Even a postmodernist bloodbath is wet sticky and red. Tarantinos feature ""Death Proof"" though its based on seventies car-chase movies like ""White Line Fever"" isnt as flagrantly imitative as ""Planet Terror""; nor are its images as rigorously defaced. The movie begins with a chummy girl posse (Sydney Poitier Jordan Ladd Vanessa Ferlito) riding around Austin in a red Honda Civic hatchback and then settling into a comfortable bar for the night. The talk is intimate detailed funny. Tarantino demonstrates his usual insistence on sociability everyone gets a chance to elaborately explain herself curse up a storm and wrangle with friends. Then Kurt Russell enters the bar; hes the legendary Stuntman Mike a veteran stunt-car driver and as he sweet-talks Ferlito in his soft voice his weathered ease is enormously charming. Something like normality appears to be taking over the screen. But Mike it turns out has a mysterious grudge against young women. His stunt car has been reinforced against crashes--made deathproof--and he rams into the three women on the highway in the dark. Homicide by vehicular assault is a gooney teen fantasy and Tarantino goes all the way with the extreme violence of it showing us the womens bodies being pulled apart over and over. Tarantino obviously likes his characters a great deal but hes caught in the contradictions of making an hommage a schlock he has to kill the women in order to set up the rest of the movie. Its as if he couldnt decide whether to be a humanist or a nihilist so he opportunistically becomes both. Immediately he brings on another group of chattering girls two of whom (Zoe Bell and the fast-talking Tracie Thoms) are movie stuntwomen themselves. Just for fun Bell straps herself to the hood of a roaring 1970 Dodge Challenger with nothing more than two belts tied to the window posts. When Stuntman Mike shows up and starts banging his death car into the Dodge the women refuse to give in and a classic battle follows. As the cars try to force each other off the road the struggle rages across backcountry Texas terrain in (as far as we can tell) real space at good speed and without digital enhancement. Nothing quite this exciting has been seen since Steven Spielbergs 1971 film ""Duel."" In the end Tarantino has his triumph in ""Grindhouse"" but apart from this scene and a few good jokes the movie wont do much for anyone who doesnt have an academic or fanboy absorption in junk. Tarantino and Rodriguez assume that well relish the movies violence or shrug it off as play as they do but not everyone in the audience will want his enjoyment of it taken for granted that way--the mashed and maimed bodies leave depressing images in the mind and at this moment in history carry terrible associations. The two men love movies love movie culture love audiences but how can you accept a love that expresses itself obsessively with an assault on the human body? ""Truthfully original scares me a little"" says Lenny (Sigourney Weaver) the head of a television network in Jake Kasdans satirical comedy ""The TV Set."" Lenny is the chief nemesis of Kasdans hard-pressed hero the writer-producer Mike Klein (David Duchovny) a veteran of the TV wars who has a challenging idea for a new show--""The Wexler Chronicles"" its called and its about what happens to a young man when his brother commits suicide. Its meant to be a serious idea with comic overtones but we never find out whether it would have worked because Lenny keeps squeezing and altering the original conception until the show--now titled ""Call Me Crazy""--becomes a piece of conventional whimsy. Lenny whose latest smash is ""Slut Wars"" a reality show in which long-stemmed tootsies stand around in bikinis openly loathes art which she considers not only a waste of time but an insult to her. Ferociously she insists on blandness. Weaver never one to hold back gives her readings a crushing vehemence. As a comedienne she doesnt have the lyrical gift--the charge of fantasy--that Faye Dunaway brought to a similar character thirty years ago in ""Network"" but shes effectively hateful and poor earnest Mike doesnt stand a chance. Kasdan the son of the Hollywood insiders Lawrence and Meg Kasdan has been working in movies and television since his debut as a child actor in ""The Big Chill"" in 1983 and he appears to know with an almost nauseated sense of familiarity all the ways in which the TV industry can cheat cozen seduce and buy even a halfway serious writer out of his convictions. Kasdan is shrewd and funny about such things as the ease with which powerful people can mimic when they need to the forms of sincerity and concern. The satire is unrelenting but not too broad; it stays close to common observation. Kasdans special target the astonishing Hollywood habit of prefacing even the most negative opinions of a writer or an actors work with upbeat panegyrics (""We loved it Loved it"") followed by the inevitable ""But we have some concerns"" which it turns out completely undermine whatever it was that the writer or the actor was trying to do.

No Urine Grindhouse is great. Too bad it cant be seen in its natural habitat. _ By David Edelstein ShareThis (Photo Andrew Cooper/Courtesy of the Weinstein Company) At three hours and change boasting two rowdy full-length features a slew of garish fake coming attractions and steady eruptions of carnage and cruelty the Quentin TarantinoRobert Rodriguez collaboration Grindhouse is an ode to the era of exploitation houses and an orgy for those who want to live (or relive) the dream. Its a real Travis Bickle night outa switchback journey into the belly of the B-movie beast. First Rodriguez serves up a zombie-infection shoot-em-up splatterfest called Planet Terror which plays like a bunch of other horror movies stitched together by a sloppy but high-spirited mad scientist. Then comes Tarantinos Death Proof a more intimate and much more disturbing brew. All thats missing are the scary bathrooms and pungent aromas of urine and dope. Rodriguez has learned a few moves since his last big Tarantino collaboration the rhythmless vampire farrago From Dusk Till Dawn. In this Tex-Mex bouillabaisse he has a luscious object in Rose McGowan who opens Planet Terror with a lissome semi-naked pole dance and then sinks to the stage in tears What a soulful actress what a bod. Rodriguezs camera drinks in her pink face with its dimpled chin and pillowy red lips then hugs her long stems in her short vinyl skirt and go-go boots. There it is folksthe story in pictures of why he left his wife and kids for her. When rampaging zombies rip off one of those gams and the hot-rod hero (Freddy Rodriguez) screws a submachine gun into her stump McGowan edges out Uma Thurman in Kill Bill as the ultimate abused-and-fetishized action-movie femme. The other heroine is mangled and fetishized tooMarley Shelton (the doomed beauty in the overture to Rodriguezs Sin City) as a skinny blonde lesbian doctor with a set of syringes tucked into her garter. Its always a trip to watch exploitation auteurs ogle their female characters while those ladies are busy nailing male voyeurs. BACKSTORY During Times Squares porno glory days grindhouse theaters lined the blocks around 42nd Street. But they started disappearing in the late eighties after Mayor Koch shut many down during late-night raids. Giuliani completed their eradication. The one lone grindhouse left within city limits according to the Post (which should know of what it speaks) is the Fair Theatre in East Elmhurst which opened on the heels of the 1939 Worlds Fair. It can hold 599 people and is said to have separate boothsno extra costat which patrons can privately enjoy well whatever it is they came for. Malignant machismo is embodied by Bruce Willis as an infected commando whose face begins to bubble when he stops breathing the (short-term) antidote. (I wont reveal the source of the contagionbut it has a nice resonant political tang.) Before long the maimed and the festering converge on an Austin barbecue joint where most of the ensemble is shot blown up or dismembered. This isnt your usual exploding-blood-squib splatter by the way; think exploding water balloons. In Planet Terrors brief but tumultuous running time Rodriguez pays homage to a long line of directors from Howard Hawks to George Romero to John Carpenter to his bad-boy buddy Tarantinowho shows up as an actor in his favorite kind of role a sexual sadist who gets a gory comeuppance. Which brings us to Death Proof in which the murders are more shocking insofar as the characters are viewed as something other than receptacles of blood and pus. What makes some critics knee-jerk derision of Tarantino so vexing is that hes more than a violence peddler. Hes a predatory humanist. He loves just to hang out with his soon-to-be-beleaguered characters in this case two sets of women. The first threea celebrity Austin D.J. known as Jungle Julia (Sydney Tamiia Poitier) and her friends Shanna (Jordan Ladd) and Arlene (Vanessa Ferlito)are chafing under their roles as women of color and objects of lust. (Of course they do stretch out in short shorts for our delectation.) In a local bar and chili parlor a pair of geeks (director Eli Roth and Omar Doom) plot ways to get the women drunk and into bed. But theyre lightweights beside the scarred macho man (Kurt Russell) at the bar who calls himself Stuntman Mike does John Wayne imitations and drives a black Charger he boasts is reinforced for high-speed collisions and rollovers deathproof. The scene in the bar goes on and on to the point where you wonder just what the point is although Rose McGowan is delightful in an entirely different role a blonde hippie chick and as Tarantinos camera arcs around the room the dread becomes increasingly hard to dispel. The second set of women show up before weve fully digested the fate of the first group. But these are ladies of a different stripe fresh from a movie shoot a makeup person (Rosario Dawson) an actress in a flouncy cheerleader uniform (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and most significantly a pair of stuntwomen (Zoe Bell and Tracie Thoms) who gush about vintage speedsters and car movies like Vanishing Point and Dirty Mary Crazy Larry macho girls behaving badly. Its the other side of the grindhouse from Russ Meyers boobalicious kickboxers to Pam Griers foxy vigilantes. Chicks you mess with at your peril. Death Proof like all of Tarantinos work exists in a strange space between homage and masturbation. Its a grim stalker picture a car-chase picture and a raucous anthem to female empowerment. Its also a small masterpiece dredged up from the psyche of a movie freak who loves women onscreen almost as much as he loves to punish women onscreen and who (this is what makes him an artist) gets off most on his own ambivalence. 1 2 3 Next Share this story...

When major studios are already re-making such low-rent classics as The Texas Chain Saw Massacre Dawn of the Dead Gone in Sixty Seconds and The Hills Have Eyes for mainstream multiplex consumption whats the point of a double-bill that aims to resurrect the glory days of the cheap thrill?If youre still asking yourself that question as you take your seat you wont be mere moments after Grindhouse hits the screen. Opening with a mock generic ""Feature Presentation"" title followed by an eerily convincing trailer for an upcoming latino-revenge movie called Machete Grindhouse establishes its credibility as both mock-artifact and geeky fetish object even before the opening feature - Robert Rodriguezs zombie-apocalypse orgy Planet Terror - releases its pustules across the screen from the popping audio track runny colours scratched frames and stripper lounge muzak theres no confusing this with any recent attempt to dress up Leatherface for the text- messaging crowd. As much a recreation of the ambient grindhouse experience - which involved attending movies at any venue from urban neighbourhood theatres to rural drive-ins that specialized in cheaply-rented schlock - as an homage its spirit this is one perversely meticulous act of pop cultural necrophilia. Grindhouse - the total all-in package including the trailers Planet Terror and Quentin Tarantinos totally dissimilar roadkill movie Death Proof - not only summons long-dead trash cinema forms back from the grave it jumps their bones and bangs them silly.The more feverishly cannibalistic of the two movies Rodriguezs Planet Terror siphons George A. Romeros rampaging zombie spectacles through John Carpenters pulsating comic book esthetic.Its set in a small town - provided as it is in Death Proof by the evocatively off-Hollywood environs of Austin Tex. - where a sinister military snafu has unleashed a plague of bloodthirsty chemical casualties.Rodriguezs movie opens on an icky exchange of bullets profanities and freshly-torn testicles and merely gets ruder from there.To the accompaniment of the directors own Carpenteresque basement-made electronic score the movie moves to a hospital where the infected are being delivered in droves and the makings of a motley B-movie militia (Freddy Rodriguezs leatherboy Wray Rose McGowans one-legged go-go girl Cherry Michael Biehns stoic cop Marley Sheltons syringe-packing nurse etc.) locks and loads for action. Essentially a series of increasingly outrageous gross-out set-pieces culminating in a military-base siege that actually namechecks Osama Bin Laden before featuring the singularly memorable sight of McGowan mowing down dozens of soldiers and pus-buckets with the machine gun attached to the stump mere inches from the hem of her leather skirt Planet Terror almost offers a surfeit of garage-sale craziness.How you may well wonder - as you watch the between-feature trailers (directed specifically for the movie by fellow grindhouse revivalists Rob Zombie Eli Roth and Edgar Wright) for fake films Werewolf Women of the S.S. Dont and Thanksgiving - is Tarantino going to top this?But top it he does and by dropping the pace into rumbling low gear and letting it throb there before letting Death Proof burn some serious rubber on the Texas blacktop.Ostensibly a wrong-place-wrong-time road movie of the venerable Vanishing Point Macon County Line Texas Chain Saw Massacre tradition Tarantinos movie is also the directors loving homage to the girl-revenge B-movie (ie. Coffy I Spit on Your Grave Faster Pussycat Kill Kill) buoyed by no small amount of elaborate self-referencing. Opening with a long car interior that recalls Travolta and Jacksons protracted burger dissertation in Pulp Fiction Death Proof is as fascinated with quoting the directors own previous work as it is the work that originally inspired it. Characters float obscure pop culture references (BJ and the Bear Dirty Mary and Crazy Larry The High Chapparal) like so much Marlboro smoke and the movies most elaborately choreographed non-automotive scene involves a group of movie-biz women (Rosario Dawson Tracie Thoms Mary Elizabeth Winstead and real-life Kiwi stuntperson Zoe Bell) talking movies sex and cars in a restaurant while a Reservoir Dogs-like camera prowls in hungry circles around them.While Death Proofs generic requirements are fulfilled by the arrival of the smooth-talking Charger-driving Stuntman Mike (a terrifically-cast Kurt Russell) who cruises the Texas backroads in search of comely prey the real heat of the film is provided by the unbuttoned blue-streak camaraderie of the films twin groups of roving foxes. Indeed if the movie ever flirts with anything approaching Rodriguezs off-the-hook tastelessness its in Tarantinos obvious lust for knockout women who drive fast cars know their trash movies and muscle cars and can swear with swaggering abandon. Not even Russell as composed and menacingly alpha-male as his Stuntman Mike is comes close as a match. By the time he spots his second group of potential victims as they fly by performing an astonishing high-speed stunt you want to reach into the screen and warn the dude to reconsider.Released in North America as the integrated retro-experience Grindhouse both Planet Terror and Death Proof are set to open in separate longer versions in Europe before being similarly broken down for domestic DVD release. (Both movies feature tantalizing `Missing Reel interruptions.) While the idea of an even longer Planet Terror is exhausting even to consider the character-fuelled Death Proof could easily lend itself to even more rambling around between incidents. Its a routine complaint about movies today that theyve run out of new ideas. Grindhouse suggests that argument may miss the point. As the best trash movies always reminded us the art is in what you do with the old ones.

"Grindhouse | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; grindhouse ) Grindhouse (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli The term ""grindhouse"" refers to a specific type of 60s and 70s exploitation film the sex-and-gore soaked fare that played in run-down urban cinemas and drive-in theaters. With their consistently poor production values and often horrifically bad direction and acting grindhouse movies developed a cult following that reveled in such guilty pleasures and accepted them for what they were. Filmmakers Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino were among the charter members of this fan club and their previous work has been informed to one degree or another by their love of these movies. With Grindhouse a valentine to exploitation films its all out in the open. Depending on your point-of-view this is either a nostalgic stroll through a cheesy slice of American pop culture or an attempt to provide a tongue-in-cheek reinvigoration of it. Most likely its a little of both. Grindhouse is not going to appeal to everyone. This is cinema as an expression of pulp with attitude rather than art in a conventional sense. Its the ultimate genre film and those without an appreciation for the genre arent likely to be convinced by anything co-directors Roberto Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino say or do. These guys are speaking from the hearts and their work here is a proverbial labor of love. But that doesnt mean everyone sitting in the theater will get it or indeed is intended to get it. The film is structured as a double feature with a single fake trailer at the outset and three more during the intermission. (Those wanting to take a real break will have to miss at least one of the trailers.) Although both features fall under the ""grindhouse"" label they are different sorts of expression. Rodriguezs Planet Terror which bats lead-off is a tongue-and-cheek satire of the exploitation genre with excesses that goes so far over-the-top that the production veers into comedy. Rodriguez is intentionally making a very bad film which is precisely how one lampoons this sort of movie. Tarantino on the other hand has elected to play things straight. His Death Proof is a largely sincere attempt to re-create a grindhouse effort in 2007. The four fake trailers each between two and three minutes long are spoofs. Rodriguez offers Machete with Danny Trejo as a wronged Mexican out for bloody revenge. Rob Zombie provides Werewolf Women of the S.S. (the title is all that needs to be mentioned). Edgar Wrights Dont Scream is the weakest of the faux previews. The best is Eli Roths Thanksgiving which was made after a careful study of the late 70s trailers for John Carpenters Halloween which it mimics. Planet Terror offers a familiar horror storyline a ragtag group of survivors battling against an army of zombies. As the stripper Cherry Rose McGowan is the standout here. After having her leg gnawed off by the diseased creatures she rebounds with a fake limb that doubles as a gun and rocket launcher. Cherrys not the kind of girl you want to mess with. Shes surrounded by the usual suspects including Freddy Rodriguez as Wray (whos really good with guns and knives) Marley Shelton as Dr. Dakota Block (whos really good with needles) and Bruce Willis as a corrupt military guy (whos not good with much of anything). Death Proof features Kurt Russell as Stuntman Mike a psycho who has suffered a few too many blows to the head. Mike hangs out at a bar where he picks up a girl for a ride in his car that shell never forget. When hes done with her he goes back to play with her friends who are paying too much attention to the radio and too little attention to the road ahead. Later he decides to play cat-and-mouse games with some other women but this time he makes a mistake when choosing his prey. Rodriguezs is the lighter of the two films. If theres a genre convention he misses Im hard pressed to figure out what it is. He references at least a dozen zombie films most obviously those by George A. Romero. Theres plenty of extreme gore to go along with the explosions and the action. McGowan is great and who cant help be wowed by the sight of her spinning 360 degrees while mowing down zombies with her leg-gun. For Planet Terror thats the money shot. Its obvious that in making this movie Rodriguez allowed himself a little indulgence. If only he hadnt thrown in the Tarantino cameo. (Q.T.s acting hasnt improved and he sticks out like a sore thumb when he appears on screen which happens during both ends of this double-bill.) Death Proof is oddly structured. Much as Grindhouse is comprised of two pieces so too is Death Proof. The first half spins its wheels a little on launch with the chit-chat of the girls at the bar coming across as flat. Theres a big-time payoff to this segment but it takes a while to get there. As soon as Kurt Russell and Rose McGowan get into his car Tarantino ratchets things up. Shortly thereafter the cast turns over and thats when Death Proof takes off. The conversation between Rosario Dawson Tracie Thoms and Zoe Bell is vintage Tarantino filled with all the riffs and verbal jousting one expects from the directors dialogue. From there it doesnt take long for the movie to downshift its resemblance from Duel to Faster Pussycat Kill Kill As always Tarantino loves throwing in the pop references and they come fast and furious with nods to TV shows movies (especially Vanishing Point) and music. As a testament to the directors fetishes there are lots of shots of tight buns and bare feet. In an attempt to more effectively replicate the grindhouse experience Tarantino and Rodriguez intentionally scratched up the negatives to make it appear as if the prints are worn and in some cases badly spliced. Each feature has a missing reel (Tarantino uses this opportunity to make a joke at the viewers expense and its pretty funny). The stock ""burns"" at one time and there are those oh-so-cheesy ""coming attractions"" inserts. Heres a little irony worth mentioning. In 2003 the Weinsteins elected to split Tarantinos previous feature Kill Bill into two volumes to maximize profit. The result was a single story awkwardly subdivided into a pair of inferior films. Grindhouse represents the opposite two individual movies spliced into a single long movie going experience. I suppose one could consider this cinematic karma and it effectively debunks the argument that Kill Bill was bifurcated due to its length. At 310 Grindhouse is as long as any single-volume Kill Bill would have been. Those going to Grindhouse need to be prepared for a long afternoon or evening at the theater. Because theres more variety here than one normally finds in a long film things move pretty fast but a 190 minute commitment is still a 190 minute commitment. Its possible to argue which end of the twin billing offers the better 90 minutes but both have their strengths and weaknesses. Death Proof doesnt have Planet Terrors humor pyrotechnics and high action quotient; Planet Terror lacks Death Proofs dialogue innovative car chases and brilliantly realized ""big moments."" Theres no question that Grindhouse accomplishes what the directors set out to do - open up the exploitation movie experience to a new generation while steeping it in nostalgia for older viewers. Theres nothing brilliant or groundbreaking about the film (in fact both directors have done better work in previous projects) but it is solidly unabashedly entertaining. Grindhouse is the kind of movie where its necessary to put aside pretensions and enjoy the product on its terms with all the sexiness violence gore and camp as part of the parcel. This is three-plus hours of gleeful-but-guilty escapism.

"Grindhouse is bloody good. Slate Sign In Sign Up Grindhouse is bloody good. Grindhouse is bloody good. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.April 5 2007 1007 PM Bloody Good Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguezs Grindhouse. By Dana Stevens Rose McGowan and Kurt Russell in Grindhouse Watching Death Proof the second Tarantino-directed half of the Robert Rodriguez/Quentin Tarantino double bill Grindhouse (the Weinstein Co.) there are moments that feel like a throwback to seeing Pulp Fiction in a crowded multiplex in 1994 with the audience gasping and giggling in delighted unison at the wild plot twists and goofy patter. Weve all experienced some degree of Tarantino fatigue since then whether with the director himself (who sometimes seems to be using the screen as a place to play out his own airless adolescent fantasies) or with the endless imitations spawned by his particular brand of fast-talking genre-savvy splatter (this years dreadful Smokin Aces is one latter-day example). Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. But Death Proof is a reminder of what there was to like about Tarantino in the first place his uncanny ear for dialogue thats at once naturalistic and deliriously wordy his kinetic action sequences and his voracious love for cinema in all its incarnations especially the sleazy ones. With its lean 90-minute running time and a near-complete absence of CGI Death Proof feels like an experiment in austerity after more than a decade in which Tarantino had free run of the special-effects candy store. And it works fabulously much to the surprise of this generally Tarantino-weary writer. Advertisement But true to the logic of the double feature I will keep you waiting for the juicy stuff. First a few words on the curious artifact that is Grindhouse not just two back-to-back horror features but a whole package of painstakingly reproduced exploitation entertainment including four trailers for fake coming attractions and a local ad for a sad-looking Tex-Mex joint called Acuna Boys (""located right next to the theater""). The whole bundle clocks in at just more than 3 hours and 10 minutes running time. The film stock is scratched the soundtrack is full of pops there are frames and whole reels missing--in short no effort has been spared to make this feel like a long Sunday matinee at a dubiously safe movie house in 1973 (though both movies are set in the present day). Planet Terror Rodriguezs feature contribution is 10 minutes shorter than Death Proof but it feels 20 minutes longer. That may be because Rodriguezs project--to reconstruct a vintage zombie flick with a few satirical twists--paints itself into a corner conceptually while Tarantinos manages to open out from genre parody onto something new. Planet Terrors setup is pure George Romero On a military base chemical weapons are unleashed that threaten to turn the population of a small town--and eventually the entire world--into flesh-eating monsters with bubbly pustules on their faces. Humanitys only hope rests with a small band of townsfolk who are mysteriously resistant to the virus including Wray (Freddy Rodriguez) a mysterious loner who may be the legendary gunman El Rei; Dakota McGraw (Marley Shelton) a doctor whos planning to leave her husband for her lesbian lover (Stacy Ferguson aka Fergie); and Cherry Darling (Rose McGowan) a go-go dancer and would-be stand-up comic who loses her leg in a zombie-related incident. Wrays attempts to compensate for Cherrys severed limb eventually result in the films iconic poster image a beautiful woman with a machine-gun prosthesis for a leg blasting the hell out of some wicked zombies. Its a sexy visual joke that goes a long way but not quite as far as Rodriguez wants to stretch it. Planet Terror is effective insofar as it keeps the viewer in a constant state of nauseated tension with one gross-out image after another. The gore is deliberately fake-looking and absurd but that doesnt make it any less yucky to watch Naveen Andrews pelt Bruce Willis with a bag full of severed human testicles. Rodriguez who directed the Spy Kids movies and co-created The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl with his young son is like a fourth-grade boy trying to elicit the biggest ""ew"" possible from his audience ""What if a zombie like popped his giant face pustule right into your mouth?"" Ew. I wont reveal a lot about Death Proofs story here since the subversion of slasher-movie conventions (who lives who doesnt; whos a main character whos not) is responsible for most of the movies thrills. We spend the first half-hour or more cruising aimlessly around Austin with a trio of sexy young women (Vanessa Ferlito Sydney Tamiia Poitier and Jordan Ladd). Amid long stretches of desultory Tarantinian jabber they drink send text messages flirt with random men at bars and generally make being single in Austin look like the most fun a human could possibly have. Those who like their action fast and furious may find this windup too slow but I loved the way it played with the standard rhythm of the horror movie in which characters (especially female ones) are set up just enough for us to care--but not too much--when they get gutted. Here the women emerge as separate vibrant personalities not the slut the nice girl and the quiet best friend but three rowdy unapologetically sexual party girls who care more about each other than the dudes trying to get into their pants. Advertisement Those dudes include Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell) a grizzled slightly pathetic biker-type who boasts about having done work for TV shows that were before the girls time. He offers another bar patron (Rose McGowan) a ride home in his tricked-out stunt car--and then--but here I should leave a reel missing in the grand grindhouse tradition and let you find out for yourself. In the movies second half another group of young women drive around exchanging verbal jabs. This time all of them are professionals from the film industry including two stuntwomen Kim (Tracie Thoms) and Zoe (Zoe Bell--a real-life stuntwoman who served as Uma Thurmans stunt double in the Kill Bill movies). Kim and Zoe are looking for kicks as off-duty stuntwomen will do and they have a pistol a 1970 Dodge Challenger that doesnt belong to them and a willingness to do stuff no sane person would dare. Re-enter Stuntman Mike and cue an extended and spectacular car chase--spectacular not because of the number and variety of stunts but because all of them are really happening on a real speeding car with the real Zoe Bell clinging to the hood. Tarantinos choice to use a stuntperson in a major role make us care about her character and then place her in physical peril is a simple but brilliant coup that may spark a new casting trend in Hollywood (in Asia theyve been doing it for a while). But please little girls with stuntwoman dreams--dont try this at home. Among the fake trailers two stand out as gems. Rodriguez directed a two-minute teaser for a revenge-of-the-federales picture called Machete whose tag line says it all ""They fucked with the wrong Mexican."" And Edgar Wright the director of the British zombie comedy Shaun of the Dead contributes a brilliant parody of those horror-movie teasers based entirely on reverse psychology ""If youre thinking of going in the basement Dont. If youre thinking of seeing this movie alone Dont."" The movies title Dont. Its tough to imagine how or whether Grindhouse will find an audience given its behemoth running time and incessant referencing of pop-cultural trivia that will be alien to anyone under 30 and plenty of people much older than that. But you dont need to be an exploitation fanboy to appreciate the energy imagination and spirit with which Rodriguez and Tarantino pay homage to the cheapo cinema they love.

Photo Courtesy Of Dimension Films Pho 2 movies 2 directors one pulp-fiction stew 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Grindhouse Starring Rose McGowan Freddy Rodriguez Kurt Russell Michael Biehn and Vanessa Ferlito. Directed by Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino. (R. 191 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) In ""Grindhouse"" directors Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino have packaged two feature-length movies into one long evening of entertainment. Together the movies -- along with funny faux trailers that advertise nonexistent action movies -- seek to re-create an experience common 20 or 30 years ago thats now fading into history that of being in a cheap neighborhood ""grind house"" watching old badly projected prints of badly acted but strangely entertaining action films. That makes ""Grindhouse"" two movies in one. Theres ""Planet Terror"" by Rodriguez about a horrible virus that turns people into flesh-eating zombies. And theres ""Death Proof"" by Tarantino a murder and revenge story. The Rodriguez segment is terrific and shows a director in complete control of tone image and story. His horror film partakes of the vitality of the genre even as hes satirizing it so the film is always working in two ways -- for real and for laughs. The Tarantino by contrast has flashes of interest and eventually achieves a certain visceral impact but its long-winded and juvenile the work of a director who hasnt grown and whats more seems afraid to try. The contrast is striking and as surprising as the musical number at this years Academy Awards when Beyonce suddenly wiped the floor with Jennifer Hudson in their duet. One would think that grind house moviemaking would be the natural province of Tarantino. Instead he indulges in long puerile dialogue passages that no respectable grind house audience would ever have tolerated and that few ""Grindhouse"" patrons of today will enjoy -- not 2 1/2 hours into an evening. In truth Tarantino doesnt even attempt a grind-house-style feature. His pace is the antithesis of the genre and ""Death Proof"" is languorous and ruminative the movie equivalent of a very dull very stoned person offering up random thoughts. Fortunately Rodriguez goes first and he does everything right including the small details. For example in the films one sex scene the print quality suddenly becomes grainy and there are missing frames. Thats to replicate what would happen in the old movie houses in which projectionists would screen the one lewd scene over and over in their off hours and maybe snip out the most salacious sections to bring home for themselves. Rodriguez demonstrates a voluminous familiarity with the conventions of low-budget filmmaking circa 1980 and offers them up one scene after another with impressive fluency. Everything here weve seen before sort of The scene in which a patient suffering from a mystery ailment visits a doctors office and something routine becomes something horrible. Or the scene in which we think someone is dead but he springs up alive and joking around. Or the attempt by a frantic woman to get away in a car while something or someone smashes her windshield. Or the parade of zombies that turns up out of nowhere moving forward never running but getting ever closer. Rodriguez gives us these and more Theres the creepy but resilient guy who works at the cafe (Jeff Fahey) and the by-the-book cop (Michael Biehn) who finds himself fighting side-by-side with a man he once considered a criminal (Freddy Rodriguez). And of course theres the go-go dancer with a dream -- played by Rose McGowan in the best showcase of her career so far. In making ""Planet Terror"" its as if Rodriguez tapped into some grind house side of his brain and this emerged fully formed and lots of fun. And he never forgets the first rule of action movies If something can happen either now or later have it happen now and just come up with something even bigger for later. As for Tarantinos ""Death Proof"" you can watch it or just watch the trailers that precede it and leave knowing that by then youve had your moneys worth. It tells the story of four women who go to a bar for a long night of drinking. In the same bar is Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell) who has a car that he says is ""death proof."" Theres lots of banter about sex and movies and popular culture and some of it is mildly interesting and some of it is flat-out boring. Later we meet four other women and they do lots of talking too but theres also some action and thats where it picks up a little. Tarantino with his knack for casting wisely puts real-life stunt double Zoe Bell in a key role. But the story is just an excuse for blather and unpleasantness. One thing about low-budget grind-house-style action movies They always deliver on the story. Theyre the cinematic equivalent of beach-read novels They hook you with the story and force you to put up with the rest. But while Rodriguez juggles a host of characters and delivers on a complicated plot Tarantino offers up just another listless linear revenge tale. Its as if hes not even trying. Maybe he thinks it isnt cool to try. -- Advisory Graphic violence nudity strong language.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor April 6 2007 Save for later Saved ""Grindhouse"" is an homage to 1970s exploitation movies - an homage to badness. Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez best known for ""Sin City"" and the ""Spy Kids"" films combine forces to create a double bill Tarantinos ""Death Proof"" is a joy riding ""girls meet psycho stalker"" flick while Rodriguezs ""Planet Terror"" aims to be the ultimate zombie movie.A perverse glee runs through both halves of this film which along with a slew of hilarious trailers for mock movies such as ""Machete"" and ""Werewolf Women of the SS"" runs over three hours. The trailers may in fact be the highlight of the package in terms of sheer lowdown grunginess and are the handiwork of Rodriguez Eli Roth and Edgar Wright.""Planet Terror"" is a straight-faced gross out involving an influx of zombies who invade a local community and overrun its hospital. Despite all the sicko shenanigans a sort of love story of sorts emerges between go-go dancer Cherry (Rose McGowan) and her heroic ex (Freddy Rodriguez). Cherry achieves her apotheosis when she replaces her severed right leg with a machine gun and blasts away at the advancing hordes. The splat quotient is very high. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? ""Death Proof"" is essentially two extended sections In the first a trio of girlfriends (played by Vanessa Ferlito Jordan Ladd and Sidney Poitiers daughter Sydney) tool through Austin Texas and have a doomy encounter in a bar with Stuntman Mike (a low-key maniacal Kurt Russell) whose Dodge Charger is reinforced for movie stuntwork so that its - you guessed it - ""death proof."" In the films second phase Mike gets his comeuppance when he goes up against three Tennessee stuntwomen (played by Zoe Bell Tracie Thomas and Rosario Dawson) in their Dodge Challenger. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Unlike ""Planet Terror"" ""Death Proof"" is more of a riff than a homage. Tarantino devotes a great deal of time to scenes of the women just sassing each other - at times its like a grindhouse version of ""The View."" But the dialogue is good and the action once it starts is scary-funny and done without a single CGI effect.In all its a fun exercise in nostalgia but a three-hour homage to grade Z movies is a long sit. Grunge overload sets in early.Tarantino has often fetishized movie trash and at his best he allows us to share in his nut-brain ardor. The problem is there is only so far you can go in this direction without fatiguing not only the audience but also yourself. Tarantino may have moved beyond the grindhouse conventions he has routinely championed. The extended sequences with the women in ""Death Proof"" before the blood and the vroom-vroom set in could be his newfound attempt to humanize his people instead of treating them as car-crash mannequins. He has such a good loosey-goosey feeling for the back-and-forth jabber of girlfriends that you almost wish he had jettisoned the skidding U-Turns and just made a film about women hanging out. Grade B+ Rated R for strong graphic bloody violence and gore; pervasive language; some sexuality nudity and drug use.

"Flicks In the Days Of Gore washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Correction to This Article A photo caption with an April 6 Style review of the movie ""Grindhouse"" misspelled the name of actress Sydney Tamiia Poitier. Movies Flicks In the Days Of Gore Sydney Tamila Porter as Jungle Julia in Quentin Tarantinos ""Death Proof"" half of ""Grindhouse."" (By Andrew Cooper -- Dimension Films) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday April 6 2007 What truly grinds in the film ""Grindhouse"" the Quentin Tarantino-Robert Rodriguez double feature is your butt against the seat. Clocking in at more than three hours the film is one grand self-indulgence that is calibrated exquisitely for an audience that pines for the gory double-feature format that petered out in the early 70s. That audience can be counted One two. Named Tarantino and Rodriguez. ""Grindhouse"" actually two movies in one attempts to reconstruct to the tiniest detail the actual double-feature experience in a sleazy urban theater 35 to 40 years ago and if the boys had been able to afford Smell-O-Vision theyd have offered up the fumes of popcorn decomposing in a greasy bin in the lobby the stench of ancient Jujubes annealed to the ceiling and even the sickly-sweet chemical tang of that wafer or whatever it was they put in the urinal. As it is they replicate the scratchy ratchety nature of oft-showed film stock; the hang-ups where the movie sticks in the projector ignites and achieves bubbly brown liquefaction; the crude emergency splices; the out-of-sync sound system; and all the high hallmarks of exhibition at its lowest cheapest level. (The term ""grindhouse"" usually refers to a single-screen theater showing exploitation films.) The films -- Rodriguez directed the first ""Planet Terror"" and Tarantino the second ""Death Proof"" -- are bloody stupid and buoyant in a kind of infantile way celebrating mayhem and flesh and gore; they are ersatz replicas (with slight satirical exaggeration but not as much as you might expect) of films by Herschell Gordon Lewis (""Blood Feast"") or the automotive violence of say Richard Sarafians ""Vanishing Point."" But it goes further Theres also a selection of ""comic"" previews both before and between the features that compress the joys of upcoming grindhouse fodder like Nazi atrocity films (""Werewolf Women of the SS"") gimmicky splatter parties (""Machete"") and so forth. Theyre designated by that staple of childhood memories the whirlpool of color set to cheesy public domain music that announces ""Coming Attractions."" You feel the directors enjoying themselves as if at a giggly slumber party as the tropes pile up come around again and again and approach tedium. As for the two ""films"" they offer marginal pleasures. ""Planet Terror"" is by far the livelier drawing from work by Lewis the Italian goremeisters Mario Bava and Dario Argento and George Romero. The situation involves a bunch of people including a beautiful doctor in high heels a one-legged go-go dancer (""And I wanted to be a stand-up comedian"") a barbecue chef a wounded sheriff an old guy and a deputy (played by makeup artist Tom Savini who did some of the early gore effects in splatter flicks of the 80s) trying to escape from a landscape of heavily armed zombiefied cannibalistic killers. Also they are led by Bruce Willis with a bad case of chronic greasy bubbling facial tumors and believe me you dont want to know more. Okay heres what you get for your entertainment buck Lots of folks being shredded atomized liquefied splattered Cuisinarted or otherwise deconstructed by gunfire. Lots of folks. Almost an hours worth of folks. The payoff is when the go-go gal (Rose McGowan) is fitted with an assault rifle where her leg used to be and does some serious zombie pacification. It looks like when you put jelly beans in a microwave and hammer out a big 10 on the dial and you get splatsplatsplatsplat as the beans detonate. The movie doesnt bother to tell you by the way how she manages to pull the trigger but thats just the critic in me details details details. Tarantinos movie ""Death Proof"" is so narratively simplistic that to describe it is to ruin it. Lets just say its a car chase movie fused with a womens acting workshop and leave it at that. The antecedent is the early-70s ""car chase"" movies but also ""Dirty Mary Crazy Larry"" and ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" -- the filmmaker invokes them twice in the dialogue (and movie geek Tarantino has to specify ""the original and not the remake""). But for the longest longest longest time the movie simply indulges two sets of four actresses as they appear to improvise their way through long buildups that will ultimately have nothing to do with the completely arbitrary action sequences that mark the halfway point and the climax. And for some reason Tarantino gives the women a tough-gal gangsta stylization to their lines as they call each other ""bitch"" and the n-word (its a diverse crowd) and the 12-letter word over and over. Ach and nothing happens except their little circle is evoked The first quartet are young Texans one a deejay; the second is a group of young movie professionals in Tennessee on a shoot looking for the exact duplicate of the car Barry Newman drove in ""Vanishing Point"" a boss-mother bootie-smackin 1959 sky-blue Corvair with three on the floor and a 68-hp monster slamming away in its guts. Some surprisingly high-end performers make a contribution. Kurt Russell plays ""Stuntman Mike"" a bar visitor with what looks like the San Andreas Fault ripped across his face by King Leonidass beer-can opener who tries to chat up the young women. He later makes an appearance in Tennessee where among that group of young women the blindingly beautiful Rosario Dawson stops the action with the Helen of Troyesque power of her mythologically classic face. All this really sets up the films final few minutes of car-crazy Viking-berserker to-the-death demo derby along Tennessees rural byways and in turn an excuse to show off the stunt stylings of Zoe Bell the New Zealand stuntwoman of whom Tarantino is an unabashed fan. (She doubled for Lucy Lawless in ""Xena Warrior Princess"" and for Uma Thurman in Tarantinos two ""Kill Bill"" movies.) Shes quite possibly the best stuntwoman in the world and the movie features her on the hood of a speeding car (no its not a Corvair its a Dodge Challenger that was my little joke) more or less surfing on her backside (but staying alive) while someone rams the car trying to knock her off. Its a great stunt exhibition and if it was half as dangerous as it looks it was very dangerous. But really You have about an hour and half of yappy chatter in exchange for four minutes of high-octane road rage. Is that a deal or are you a sucker? Hmm well I would have left earlier but my shoe got stuck to the floor by an Affy Tapple stick tarred in caramel that had been there since 1972. Grindhouse (191 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for graphic bloody violence and gore pervasive profanity some sexual content nudity and scenes of drug use.

The 1970s exploitation movie gropes bites kicks slugs blasts smashes and cusses its way back to life in ""Grindhouse"" a ""Rodriguez/Tarantino double feature"" that lovingly resurrects a disreputable but cultishly embraced form of era-specific film production and exhibition. A pair of pictures devoted to re-creating their progenitors grubby aesthetics and visceral kicks but with vastly greater budgets higher-end actors and a patina of hipster cool they part company when it comes to talent and freshness. The numerous marketing problems for this bizarre pop-culture artifact begin with the three-hour-plus running time and young auds unfamiliarity with the format. But the B.O. strength of ""Sin City"" and ""Kill Bill"" alone suggests the helmers loyal followings will produce a very potent opening frame with fairly steep fall-off thereafter in the manner of most horror films. The United States may be the only territory however where the whole shebang will come out as one feature as each picture will be released separately in slightly longer versions overseas. As genre rehabs go ""Grindhouse"" is more daring and audacious than most partly due to its conception as an entire program complete with two pictures four tailor-made trailers and various for-real interstitial bits but more so because of its stylistic fidelity to its source material. Hollywood cinema from ""Jaws"" and ""Star Wars"" onward is filled with B-movie material served in A-picture bottles but Robert Rodriguezs ""Planet Terror"" and Quentin Tarantinos ""Death Proof"" mean to reproduce the shot-on-the-run look and feel of genuinely down-and-dirty pics of 35 years ago all the way to scratchy prints and missing scenes. One certain difference Neither early George Romero nor the original ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" had seven-minute end credits scrolls listing things such as directors chef and greens gang bosses. On the basis of sheer accuracy Rodriguezs installment wins points for more exactly replicating the hollow soul-sucking badness of many low-grade gore films even as he raids Romeros great ""Dead"" cycle of zombie splatter epics. By contrast Tarantinos road-rage opus so far exceeds almost anything made at the time in terms of dialogue and performance that it seems like a different beast one half plotless gabfest the other half insane car chase. Presentation begins with an authentic beat-up ""Prevues of Coming Attractions"" banner which intros a hilarious trailer for a faux actioner called ""Machete"" about a mean Mexican hombre on a violent rampage on behalf of illegals. This is one cheapo picture that could do some business and evidently Rodriguez who helmed it thinks so too as hes already said he wants to expand it to feature-length. Accompanied by the built-in sound of projector noise and terrible scratches on the print ""Planet Terror"" focuses on a demoralized go-go dancer Cherry (Rose McGowan) who gets more than she bargained for when she sets out late one night to change her life. Due to some nasty business at a nearby military base local residents are lurching around with pus-filled abscesses on their skin and unwholesome appetites. Human roadkill litters the highways and the hospital becomes overrun with disfigured and increasingly violent sickos. Forced to deal with the crisis are some questionable but mostly attractive lowlifes including Cherrys mysterious ex Wray (Freddy Rodriguez); a cop (Michael Biehn) whos heavily on Wrays case; feuding married medics (Josh Brolin and Marley Shelton) in a race to kill one another before the zombies get the chance; and a barbecue shack owner (Jeff Fahey) on the verge of perfecting a recipe. Given the recent surfeit of zombie movies and pretty good ones at that its simply not enough to re-create a highlights reel of favorite genre motifs. Rodriguez occasionally extricates himself from the muck with some genuine gross-out moments beginning with an exchange over a bulging bag of testicles between Naveen Andrews and Bruce Willis both in extended cameos. But when all the generic filler of the episode has been forgotten ""Planet Terror"" will still be remembered for one indelible iconographic sight that of the scantily attired McGowan her character having lost her right leg in the mayhem striding back into action with her missing appendage replaced by machine gun. Needless to say the weapon is put to excellent use in the Romero-inspired finale. There is a measure of wit in some details -- McGowans hair and makeup remain impeccable no matter the havoc around her -- and some of the thesps notably the leading lady and Freddy Rodriguez create something resembling characters in the one-dimensional circumstances. But with the majority of the running time devoted to overly familiar territory ""Planet Terror"" delivers only momentary kicks. An eight-minute ""intermission"" serves up tasty trailers for three more excellent candidates for exploitation immortality. ""Werewolf Women of the SS"" about ""Hitlers plan to create a race of super-women"" stars Udo Kier Sybil Danning and ""Nicolas Cage as Fu Manchu"" and is helmed with dead-on crudeness by Rob Zombie. ""Dont"" directed by Edgar Wright trades hilariously on the enticing ""Dont go in the ... "" motif of horror-pic advertising while ""Thanksgiving"" from Eli Roth cooks up a startling and grisly holiday-themed gorefest. All this is table setting for the main course and while Tarantinos ""Death Proof"" is a juicy delicious treat its pleasures stem much less from the play with genre conventions than from great dialogue and electric performances. The chick-power movie is divided into two parts both of which are exhilarating for the vibrant bonding and camaraderie they develop among two different sets of young women. Opening scene simply puts three attractive femmes in a car riding down the main commercial drag in Austin Texas talking about sex and drugs. Much as the driving conversation between John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson in ""Pulp Fiction"" was captivating for its heightened naturalism and specific detail so does the girl talk here instantly mesmerize through its casual frankness and relaxed humor; so natural are the rhythms of the banter that you instantly believe the women played by relative newcomers Sydney Poitier Vanessa Ferlito and Jordan Ladd are best buds have no secrets and constantly kid one another about their peccadilloes. A daytime meal eventually becomes a night of drinking at the funky Texas Chili Parlor. The level of raunch is amped up by booze but the talk remains great with a touch of the poet at times. Tarantino here lays a claim to being the Joseph L. Mankiewicz of trash talk so easily does he create reams of dialogue in distinct voices and so well does he direct it. As boldly as in a late Howard Hawks film like ""Hatari"" or ""El Dorado"" Tarantino confidently keeps his characters chattering away and lets about a third of the picture go by before anything much happens. Some guys (Roth Michael Bacall and Omar Doom) try to hit on the girls and eventually attention turns to the bar where an older man named Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell) strikes up a conversation with slinky Pam (McGowan again this time as a blonde). A vet movie stuntman with an easy manner Mike offers Pam a ride home in his mighty Dodge Charger a stunt-ready vehicle so reinforced as to be ""death-proof."" But it doesnt turn out to be for Pam as the Jekyll amp; Hyde-like Mike uses his car like a killing machine. A second group of women take the baton for pics ramped-up second half. Dominating these members of a Tennessee film crew on a break is foul-mouthed Kim (Tracie Thoms). Declaring that ""Theres no point to living in America unless you drive a Dodge Challenger"" fellow stuntwoman Zoe Bell (a New Zealander who was Uma Thurmans stunt double on ""Kill Bill"") gets her hands on one turning the seg into a massive homage to the 1971 cult drive-in fave ""Vanishing Point"" as it sets itself up for an extended duel between the girls Dodge and that of the now-maniacal Stuntman Mike. With third wheel Abernathy (a game Rosario Dawson) along for the ride but the fourth pal (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) sitting it out Kim races behind alongside and in front of Mike on twisty hilly roads at breakneck speeds with Zoe spread-eagled like a hood ornament up front. The hair-raising stunts are clearly absolutely real making the sequence among other things a massive middle finger from Tarantino to the interventions of CGI. Aspects of the chase which was filmed in the Santa Ynez Valley above Santa Barbara raise questions notably as to why Kim doesnt apply the brakes at key moments when Mike is running alongside her. But the sequence is still a thrill filled with loads of exciting shots filmed at high speed. Bell is a relaxed spirited natural playing herself and Thoms and Dawson are both a gas. Russell is at his best shooting the breeze in the bar but also gets off when Mike turns bad. Tarantino capably serves as his own cinematographer for the first time and the soundtrack brims with dynamite tunes. Production values throughout boast a deliberately degraded ruggedness.
