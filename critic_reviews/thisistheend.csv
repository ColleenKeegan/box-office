"Small(er) Movie Roundup Because Theres Life After Man of Steel << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Small(er) Movie Roundup Because Theres Life After Man of Steel Sony Classics Adam Driver June 19 2013 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Before Midnight directed by Richard Linklater You know those accusatory ticking-time-bomb questions two married people arent supposed to ask each other? Well after two previous installments of complicated bliss (in 1995s Before Sunrise and 2004s Before Sunset) Celine (Julie Delpy) is going there on Jesse (Ethan Hawke). ""Whats the name of the pediatrician?"" ""Would you notice me on a train now -- like right now?"" Tell me you managed not to fuck the girl you met on your book tour That last one wasnt a question. None of them truly are. But one of the glories of this movie is the way Celine expertly corners the slick man shes now married and how Jesses become an expert at evading capture. Another is the way Delpy Hawke and Linklater have managed to build a comedy around the creep of middle age and the way familiarity breeds not only contempt but also security and insecurity. Ive seen this movie three times and each time Im struck at the suspense in the films long complete conversations at how youre able to laugh at the truth of what these two are still trying to do after meeting 18 years ago on a train having an affair and marrying. Installment 3 finds Celine and Jesse (and their twin girls) at the end of a six-week Greek vacation. She doesnt know what to do next with her career. Hes worried about his relationship with the teenage son he had during his first marriage. Theres a wonderful meal with some new friends and a night in a hotel room intended for romance. But were meant to see the other side of romantic comedy the complex frustrated loving place real relationships wind up that the movies rarely confess to being aware of. The films (re)watchability is a testament not simply to the wisdom imparted but to the dramatic musicality of its tone the transparent rapport between the stars and Delpys brilliant understanding that one key to playing matrimonial anger is to add a pinch of sarcasm to cut the sense of oppression. But Hawke is just as good at remaining cool while Delpy overheats. Both actors make you feel why each is good for the other. This is a universal X-ray of bourgeois love one that in a few decades will get around to something like Amour. In the meantime when Celine reduces male desire to ""kissy-kissy titty-titty pussy snore"" you dont know whether to just say ""Amen"" or call a literary agent. This Is the End directed by Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen No its not cool that Satan here is a dream rapist that Rihanna falls through the earth into the pits of hell or that Emma Watson and her ax have only one scene. But this comedy which Goldberg and Rogen also wrote takes literalism to not-stupid extremes. The years people like me have spent carping about the problems of the so-called bromance often at Rogens expense have produced a movie that wants to call mocking attention to its excesses and privileges and then burn them down. Thats how you wind up with Rogen Jay Baruchel James Franco Jonah Hill Danny McBride and Craig Robinson playing themselves in an apocalyptic stoner flick that features a tractor beam to the pearly gates. Theyre trapped in Francos mansion while Los Angeles burns around them. Goldberg and Rogen work with a sense of philosophy and morality. They speculate about God and laugh at exorcism movies. A crazed actress slashes a plaster penis in half. The movie is obviously on drugs but theyve given its makers a kind of clarity. Theres wonder here that films with quadruple the effects budget would kill for. The East directed by Zal Batmanglij Is Brit Marling something that can be turned into? She plays Sarah an agent at a D.C. intelligence consulting firm and when her air conditioner of a boss (Patricia Clarkson) sends her undercover to infiltrate an ecoterrorist ring Marling checks into a motel and turns her hair from brown to her usual big blonde. Hollywood seems to want her in brainy girlfriend/daughter parts PhD candidate Daryl Hannah. But she and Batmanglij have a really good art-house thing going. They wrote this movie and its sharper and more convincing than their cult-infiltration movie from last year The Sound of My Voice. Sarah pauses life with her clueless Beltway beau (Jason Ritter) and joins a gang of sexy leftists called the East. They allege to be squatting in an abandoned woodland manse. They claim too that theyre leaderless. But Alexander Skarsgaards holy-hipster beard says ""Come unto men"" and come Sarah does as Ellen Page seethes with bisexual envy. Together they do ""jams"" -- kidnappings mass poisonings -- meant to teach big oil and big pharma a lesson. Will Sarah bring them all down? Or will she go East? The mix of radicalism naivete and forest-bound sex flirts with the absurd. But Marling and Batmanglij have an interest in rituals and devotion and the accompanying exploitation of belief. As artists theyre not dissimilar from an idiosyncratically talented filmmaker like Shane Carruth. But they appear to enjoy the power of storytelling. Carruth wants to obfuscate story and frustrate comprehension and for no appreciable aim really. Marling and Batmanglij dont fear or resent entertainment They make effective thrillers. With each successive collaboration you can feel them slowly coming in from the margins. If they reach a major studio and bigger budget they could be the right kind of dangerous. Frances Ha directed by Noah Baumbach How do you make a watchable film about a tedious tiresome person? Frances (Greta Gerwig) -- the 27-year-old underemployed dancer at the center of this movie -- insults freeloads and hijacks dinner parties. She has only the vaguest sense that shes not cut out for most of what she pursues. Her narcissism is vividly tedious. Another movie would have tried to mature her or turn her into a joke. But Baumbach loves loves loves her. He wrote the script with Gerwig whose flaky fuzziness tends to have this effect on directors. Baumbach happens to have been the most affected Theyre a real-life couple. Maybe this is an older artier cousin of Girls -- Adam Driver does a saner version of his HBO self but Baumbach and Gerwig are focused on the bond between Frances and her best friend Sophie (Mickey Sumner) and the way friendships change when life changes. (With her dark features long face and general sourness Sumner looks like something on loan from a Mike Leigh movie.) The aim with these characters is more to get toward some kind of truth than likability. This isnt a deep film and the ponderous argot padding it (""Tell me the story of us"" says one character to the other; ""21st century? What up"") suggests the friction in the difference between their ages (hes 14 years older). The sense of place (Brooklyn Paris Poughkeepsie) and black-and-white photography almost excuse the forced authenticity. This is not the cinematic rock and roll of his cri de divorce The Squid and the Whale or the socially apocalyptic smoke signal of Greenberg. Often when a director adores his star it results in fetish abuse nausea or deification. (With Nicolas Roeg and Theresa Russell it was all four all the time.) Baumbach is just besotted. One of the happiest sights youll see all summer is a montage of Gerwig running and twirling across Chinatown with David Bowies ""Modern Love"" on the soundtrack. Baumbach sees beauty marks on Frances where a lot of us see warts. The Internship directed by Shawn Levy In which Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn lose their analog sales jobs land summer gigs at Google and luxuriate in all the free stuff at their disposal. Wilson chases Rose Byrne. Vaughn chases any human who will laugh at him. He wrote this movie with Jared Stern. His bad-luck vulnerability needs a movie brave enough to do more than laugh it off. Its almost touching watching him try to talk his way out of having to study for a test. The comedy here is supposed to come from the competition for permanent employment with entitled freaks and geeks half their age and in that regard its a lousy sitcom that doubles as one of the most shameless commercials Ive ever seen. (At this point of course it might be no more so than Titanic was an ad for water.) Whats distressing is the movies applying romantic-comedy plot points to a megabusiness boy gets corporation. You dont need a heart to like this movie. You need an MBA.

By Anthony Lane Seth Rogen and friends in a movie that he co-directed.   Credit Illustration by Jonas Bergstrand The new Seth Rogen movie ""This Is the End"" which he wrote and directed with Evan Goldberg stars Rogen as Rogen. ""Hey Seth Rogen"" a passer-by exclaims adding ""When are you going to do some real acting man?"" Good question and one that the movie does nothing to settle. Most of the performers play themselves--or at any rate annoying avatars of what we assume to be their regular selves. Rogen heads a sextet Jay Baruchel wriggles and whines like an aggrieved eel; Jonah Hill gives us a Jonah who is so scrupulously kind that its only a matter of time before he turns nasty; Danny McBride is a boiling vat of hostility; Craig Robinson genial but antsy searches in vain for conditions that will allow him to relax; and James Franco remains his own most ardent fan beaming like the sun at just how fabulously Francoid life can be. To prove his point the bulk of the action takes place at his house in Los Angeles. Franco holds a party and invites Rogen who brings along Baruchel--an out-of-towner whose distaste for California is much sneered at. We are idly coasting through a run of celebrity cameos including Rihannas when the apocalypse arrives. Dont you just hate it when that happens? One moment were watching Michael Cera being pleasured by two women in the bathroom; the next were watching Michael Cera being impaled by a falling lamppost on the brink of a giant sinkhole with the Hollywood Hills (and if you look carefully the Hollywood sign) consumed by flames in the distance. Serves him right. From here on we are in a siege movie. Franco Rogen and the other guys take refuge in the house share out the supplies of food and drink and wait and wait. And wait. ""This Is the End"" like some of the things that show up in the second half of the story is an unusual beast. It has the controlled and knowing recklessness of a top-rate marketing exercise flush with its own audacity. To begin with there was a short unreleased film that Rogen and Baruchel made in 2007 ""Jay and Seth Versus the Apocalypse."" An eighty-five-second trailer for it was posted on YouTube and from that cheap seed planted in the damp minds of studio executives grew the multimillion-dollar bloom of ""This Is the End."" Once novels and plays have withered and died as source material could this be the future of cinematic propagation--the cultivated cult raised online and then grafted onto the big screen? Either way the outcome could not be more timely. Here bunched into one tale are the two most profitable strains of recent filmmaking. On the one hand gonzo domesticity youngish men thrown together and obliged to deal in their purest currencies--alcohol drugs and more addictive still a heap of dirty words. On the other hand enormous city-trampling special effects urging us to savor a destruction so complete and so heedless of individual pain that it can be regarded only as a joke. First the vanities then the bonfire. What links the two of course is that both require us to regress back through adolescence toward a naughty childhood with its inbuilt love of the spectacular. Is the movie fun? Yes for half the time. An hour would have sufficed. Still a late-night well-fuelled audience should find cause for raucousness not least in the furious tiff rich in hand gestures that erupts between Franco and McBride as to which of them has masturbatory rights over a copy of Penthouse. What the scene makes clear is that when Rogen and his cronies barricade themselves inside the house they are not simply fending off the brimstone. They are consolidating their status as a club for boys each of whom craves the others presence like candy and squeals like a little girl when danger comes--as when Emma Watson shows up playing Emma Watson and swinging an axe in their direction. That is meant as a rude riff on Hermione Granger but it also reinforces the depressing sense that women can be either pornographic images or axe-wielding psychos but nothing else. Franco has a giant colored statue of a phallus and guess what? Watson lops the head off. Typical. ""This Is the End"" may be even weirder than its calculations suggest. The actors want us to think of them as good sports mutual mockers and genuine friends all of which may be true; when the door is opened chez Franco we are ushered into that delusion of intimacy--the belief that no one is beyond knowing--for which the palpitations of social media have prepared us. Later on though immodesty shades into theology. As the planet starts to crumble each main character confronts his eternal destiny with a chance to outwit sulfuric damnation and join the ranks of the blessed. All this is presented as a lark; nevertheless it is a revealing fantasy and it will do little to loosen the conviction among more tight-laced souls that when Judgment Day comes and the earth gapes wide Hollywood and all its works will and should be the first to go. Hell yeah. Once you have created ""The Avengers"" in which you lassoed a gang of Marvel characters including Iron Man Captain America and Thor and wound up with the third-highest-grossing film in history what next? Easy you make a black-and-white film of ""Much Ado About Nothing"" shooting over twelve days in the safety of your own home. The project is kept secret there are no big stars and the budget is probably less than what you spent on Thors hammer. That is what Joss Whedon has done. His ""Much Ado"" is a filigree of a film although the dialogue--which is all Shakespeare snipped back--has the wiry electric toughness that we associate with this most love-obsessed and least sentimental of plays. The time is the present day and we are at the California residence of Leonato (Clark Gregg). He welcomes guests--Don Pedro (Reed Diamond) Claudio (Fran Kranz) and Benedick (Alexis Denisof)--fresh from the battlefield. None of them look military to me although as Claudio says But now I am returned and that war-thoughts Have left their places vacant in their rooms Come thronging soft and delicate desires. Softness for Claudio takes the shape of Hero (Jillian Morgese) Leonatos daughter whereas Benedick has eyes--and claws--only for Beatrice (Amy Acker) Leonatos niece. She and Benedick who used to be an item now enjoy the cordial loathing that you observe in people whose most pressing need which they refuse to acknowledge is to rip each others clothes off. Not that Whedons film feels lusty. The actors are handsome and stylish to a fault and you sometimes get the sense of having wandered into a modelling shoot for an upmarket clothing catalogue but the lunges of the libido seem oddly muffled. Whedons preference is for bodily japes; there is much tumbling over dodging in and out of doorways and in Beatrices case hiding under the kitchen counter while others chatter above. That lightness of mood goes for the skin of the movie too. The director of photography Jay Hunter shot it in at least fifty shades of gray with the stress on handheld cameras and a paucity of calmative long shots--a deliberate flight he said in an interview from what he calls the ""standoffish manner"" of many Shakespeare films. I take his point and the result fuses well with the claustrophobia of the backchat. Nonetheless there is relief as of a deep breath when we stand back to survey the candlelit procession that unfolds in shadow down steps and along dusky lawns to mark the presumed passing of Hero. Even here though as in all modern-dress productions of ""Much Ado"" we hit a bump. The story upholds the ideal of a virgin bride whose besmirching becomes a kind of death. Hero wrongly thought to have consorted with a man on the eve of her wedding is cast aside not just by the groom but also by Don Pedro and her own father. By what standard then can the movie begin as it does with Benedick waking up in Beatrices bedroom and sneaking out with his clothes? Such conduct may be allowable and natural within the world that Whedon builds furnished with cocktails and swimming pools but it scars the moral landscape in which the play takes root. That is why the film though hip and quick tends to float free away from social contracts of any import toward the fantastic. Still there is a time to stop quibbling and to laud the fact that this movie was made at all. It offers a fine lumbering Dogberry in Nathan Fillion and a number of delicious moments when Whedon gets to make fun of himself with a hit of Shakespeare. As Don Pedro intones the words ""We are the only love-gods"" for instance he gives it a shuddering bass growl like a villain suddenly teleported from the set of ""The Avengers."" This is a cool move and I hope that other large-scale directors will be inspired to launch similar ventures. Michael Bay does Congreve? J. J. Abrams blows us away with ""Lady Windermeres Fan""?

"This Is the End and The Bling Ring reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up This Is the End and The Bling Ring Two Portraits of Hollywood as a Moral Hellscape This Is the End and The Bling Ring Two Portraits of Hollywood as a Moral Hellscape Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 14 2013 607 PM This Is the End and The Bling Ring Two portraits of Hollywood as a moral hellscape. By Dana Stevens Leslie Mann and Emma Watson in The Bling Ring Courtesy of A24/American Zoetrope/NALA Films Two movies opening this week--Sofia Coppolas The Bling Ring and Seth Rogen and Evan Goldbergs This Is the End--give us a present-day Los Angeles thats at once comic and nightmarish the Hollywood dream capital turned moral hellscape. For two works with such different imagined audiences and aesthetic aims they have a surprising amount in common Both take place largely in the sumptuous homes of real-life celebrities some of whom appear as themselves. And both movies function at once as critiques of their protagonists empty pleasure-seeking materialism and as archives of the luxury swag theyve accumulated whether by theft or by overpayment. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The Bling Ring which is based on true events follows the formation and dissolution of a gang of well-off teenage burglars who specialize in invading the houses of the young rich and famous Paris Hilton Megan Fox and Orlando Bloom are among their targets. This Is the End for its part barricades a pack of actors who already are young rich and to varying degrees famous--Seth Rogen Danny McBride Craig Robinson Jonah Hill Jay Baruchel--into the house of the richest and most famous of them all James Franco where theyll squabble and bro-bond as they await the coming biblical apocalypse. Sofia Coppolas vision of the L.A. end of days may not feature giant sinkholes opening up into the Earths core and horned lava-demons stalking the living but that doesnt keep her film from being the more pessimistic of the two. The Bling Ring isnt without humor--some of scenes involving Leslie Mann as a ditzy home-schooling mother are almost too comically broad. But Coppolas tone overall is as bleak as its ever been. Her earlier portraits of celebrity-culture anomie Lost in Translation and Somewhere both centered on redemptive relationships that promised however fleetingly to save their protagonists from the spiritually barren worlds they inhabited. The Bling Rings version of redemption is purely accumulative another Birkin bag another roll of cash another closetful of Louboutins. Advertisement The Bling Ring does focus on a central relationship the friendship between Marc (Israel Broussard) an awkward gay kid whos new to the tony Los Angeles suburb of Calabasas and Rebecca (Katie Chang) a drop-dead-cool bad girl who takes him under her wing and tutors him in burglary. But without giving away what happens between Marc and Katie--or among the rest of their status-hungry circle which includes Nicki (Emma Watson) Sam (Taissa Farmiga) Chloe (Claire Julien) and a rotating crew of tag-along rich-kid wastoids--lets just say that friendship in these kids world isnt as deeply held a value as having a kick-ass stash of drugs and couture underneath your bed. For a movie about excess The Bling Ring is remarkable for its spareness. Its the most languid heist movie ever made making ample use of silence as Coppolas camera saunters casually from break-in to break-in her amoral but lissome heroes bathed in creamy Southern California light. (This was the last film of the late cinematographer Harris Savides and Coppola opens with a dedication to him.) But for all its beautifully established mood this film remained at least for me curiously unsatisfying--a kind of exquisitely tasteful after-school special. What does Coppola think and feel about the fate of these bratty lost souls? What should we think and feel? Or are we inhabiting some new world where those are no longer valid questions? This Is the End for its part has no problem making moral judgments on its characters. Those who are worthy get pulled into heaven by blue tractor beams while the unworthy plunge down vast abysses into the Earths core--a fate that in this movies world puts a significant dent in the L.A. comedy community. In an early scene Mindy Kaling Aziz Ansari and others including a hilariously out-of-character coke-addled Michael Cera all meet unspeakable comically gory fates. Left behind are Seth Rogen James Franco and the gang--all playing themselves and all supposedly the best of showbiz buds. That is until they must negotiate their own survival not to mention their complicated friendships resentments and rivalries in a world whose dangers involve demon possession unexplained beheadings and an ax-wielding Emma Watson (another commonality between The Bling Ring and This is the End Except for the ax.) What follows is essentially a series of sketch ideas strung together--but at least theyre consistently riotous sketches with time left in between for a surprisingly tender investigation of the shifting bonds among the ethically challenged bros as they discover one by one that they can neither buy nor charm their way to salvation. A.O. Scott is probably right that This Is the End represents the logical endpoint of the Apatow-bred manchild comedy How much more of a circle jerk could Rogen and Goldberg film without risking an X rating? But if This Is the End does represent its own kind of apocalypse at least the subgenre that gave us Superbad (also written by Rogen and Goldberg) and Pineapple Express is going out with a bang. This Is the End true to its subject matter is as funny as hell. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1. Clinton Takes the Lead in First Post-DNC Poll 2.

Seriously. I cant even type that title without hearing Jim Morrison purr ""beautiful friend..."" in my head. Its like naming a film Just a Shot Away and leaving out the Stones. Its poor form. Related Story The Internships Weird Unemployment Fantasy That however is my most substantial complaint with This Is the End the lightweight yet frequently hilarious directorial debut of Seth Rogen and his writing partner Evan Goldberg. The movies premise is that Jay Baruchel (playing himself) flies to Los Angeles to visit his old buddy Rogen (also playing himself) and is dragged semi-unwillingly to a party at the house of James Franco (playing... you get the idea). There they run into two distinct sets of comic celebrities Those who will still be alive at the movies half-hour mark (Franco Jonah Hill Craig Robinson Danny McBride) and those who wont (Michael Cera Jason Segel Mindy Kaling Paul Rudd David Krumholtz Aziz Ansari Christopher Mintz-Plasse Kevin Hart Martin Starr and somewhat less intuitively Rihanna). Its the capital-A Apocalypse you see so the party thins out rather quickly with most of the guests falling into a giant flaming chasm that opens up in Francos front yard. (Between this and the Red Wedding it has not been a good June for social gatherings; plan your own schedule accordingly.) Thats pretty much the situation that gives rise to this particular situational comedy. Rogen Baruchel Hill Franco Robinson and McBride hole themselves up in the house where they proceed to bicker over food sleeping arrangements--to spoon or not to spoon?--and access to the sole pornographic magazine on the premises. (Misuse of this last resource prompts a Franco-McBride dispute over ejaculation that escalates almost as revoltingly/beatifically as the penis-drawing gag in the Rogen-and-Goldberg-penned Superbad.) Much of the humor on offer is meta in the extreme. There are jokes about Francos habit of holding onto his old movie props--the cast take turns filming themselves confessionally on the camera from 127 Hours--about making a sequel to Pineapple Express and about who among those present would be most likely to force himself on Emma Watson. Early in the movie Michael Cera is hilarious as a coked-out sex-fiend version of himself and late in the movie Channing Tatum is more hilarious still as--no I wont spoil it. I will note however that the films ripoff of the demonic impregnation scene in Rosemarys Baby is considerably more horrifying than the original. Much of the humor on offer is meta in the extreme and the principal actors are within their comfort zones as one would hope given that theyre playing variations on themselves. The principal actors are all well within their comfort zones as one would hope given that theyre playing variations on themselves. (The film makes fun of itself here as well with an airport heckler taunting Rogen ""You always play the same guy in every movie. When are you going to do some acting?"") Of particular note is McBride whose sometimes-wearying brand of raunchy hyper-aggression is utilized to precisely the proper degree. This Is the End is not to put it mildly a movie for everyone. It is crass flimsily plotted and self-referential to the point of narcissistic personality disorder. For those willing to tolerate such defects however it is also very very funny.

Continue Reading Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics. Continue Reading Tom Pennington / Getty Images The Mind of Donald Trump Dan P. McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Gary Cameron / Reuters Trump Time Capsule 62 A Man Who Can Be Baited With a Tweet James Fallows None Last night in her overall very successful acceptance speech Hillary Clinton said with ruthless precision about her opponent Ask yourself Does Donald Trump have the temperament to be Commander-in-Chief? Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride. Continue Reading daily sunny/Flickr What an Introvert Sounds Like Olga Khazan The World Well-Being Project uses Facebook updates to correlate language with personality traits. Do our Facebook posts reflect our true personalities? Incrementally probably not. But in aggregate the things we say on social media paint a fairly accurate portrait of our inner selves. A team of University of Pennsylvania scientists is using Facebook status updates to find commonalities in the words used by different ages genders and even psyches. The so-called ""World Well-Being Project"" started as an effort to gauge happiness across various states and communities. ""Governments have an increased interest in measuring not just economic outcomes but other aspects of well-being"" said Andrew Schwartz a UPenn computer scientist who works on the project. ""But its very difficult to study well-being at a large scale. It costs a lot of money to administer surveys to see how people are doing in certain areas. Social media can help with that.""

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day. Continue Reading Stephanie Loos/Reuters The Elusive Manipulative Adopted Child Tina Traster Learning how to bond with my daughter who found comfort in the familiarity of being alone has come through understanding reactive attachment disorder. My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Sanderson on how men and women experience marital satisfaction differently Whenever Im walking around D.C. with friends on sunny Saturday afternoons we inevitably see lots of babies adorable fat charmingly bald babies. Its not uncommon to hear sighs of ""oh my gosh hes so precious"" and ""I want one"" from my companions; I too have been accused of being a baby stalker from time to time. But at The Atlantics One Day University event on Saturday Amherst psychology professor Catherine A. Sanderson made a convincing case that cute kids (and cute husbands and wives) might seem different when theyre yours to keep. She gave a witty lecture on what social science can tell us about happiness and these were my three biggest take-aways First I will no longer have to worry about being awesome if I get married because my husband will probably be happier for having taken vows regardless of how great I am. In studies of marital satisfaction over time Sanderson said ""there is in fact a positive correlation for some people. Guess who those people are? Men. For men yeah being married makes you happier and the good news is it doesnt matter at all who youre married to. It could be like a mail-order bride from Russia--does not matter at all.""

Grade B+ In ""This Is the End"" a horror comedy about the apocalypse a slaphappy bunch of funky comedy stars including James Franco play themselves before and after Hollywood burns. Its a gross-out extravaganza with comic heroes and antiheroes who are more like pathetic victims effects that echo torture-streaked horror films as well as the Book of Revelations and a generally debauched sensibility. In short its a bathroom-humor bacchanal that also proves to be a satisfying act of vicious group self-parody. Even if youre not a starry-eyed fan of the comedian-writers and comic actors from the TV series and movies endlessly referenced in this film - ""Freaks and Geeks"" and ""Undeclared"" on the tube ""Superbad"" and ""Pineapple Express"" on the big screen - you may find what co-writer/directors Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg have done with Franco Jonah Hill Jay Baruchel Danny McBride and Craig Robinson sporadically hilarious. In this gleefully masturbatory frolic theyre always pleasuring themselves - and surprisingly they also pleasure the audience. Actually you may find it funnier if youre not a fan of the ""Judd Apatow Gang."" Rogen and Goldberg have taken their joint identity as an arrested-adolescent friendship group to nightmare-farce extremes. You can emphasize the word ""joint"" in the phrase ""joint identity"" - partly because theyre often smoking weed. This is literally the stoner comedy from hell. With ""This is the End"" weve gone from ""Up in Smoke"" to ""Up in Flames."" Visions from the bleakest parts of the Bible break out while Franco is throwing a house-warming party in which almost everyone gets baked. The film mercilessly sends up guys whove never had to worry about practicalities. No one could be less prepared than this coddled crew for a fight to the finish against demons. When Baruchel calls for someone to toss him a knife it inevitably lands with the blade in his thigh. Its also a bromance of Brobdingnagian proportions. Franco has a special thing for Rogen. Baruchel who shares Canadian roots with Rogen thinks hes Rogens best friend - and looks askance at Rogens ""new"" friends. (Baruchel still lives in Montreal.) Robinson plays everyones best friend and McBride is everyones bad dream of a friend - a flagrantly foul embodiment of unadulterated uncontrollable id. He wont play by house rules. He starts out with the worst eating and drinking habits imaginable then goes terrifyingly downhill. And he makes an act that was uproarious yet private in ""Portnoys Complaint"" the basis for riotous public recitation. The apocalypse tests their varying brands of buddyship in more ways than one. The film goes from the challenge ""Can these friendships hold up under pressure?"" to the bigger question ""Are these really friendships or just extensions of self-love?"" Happily ""This Is the End"" never goes soft. Even when the stars practice last-minute feats of self-sacrifice in hopes of getting to heaven its as if theyre cavorting in some phantasmagoric Bravo show ""The Real Jackholes of Hollywood."" The movie is wildly erratic. Urine humor remains at least for me a theory. And there are flat-out disappointments. The party scene is so full of cameos including Michael Cera as a coked-out sex fiend that you expect more of them. Emma Watson moves from cameo to supporting player at least for one sequence. Shes terrific even cleansing in her pure cold fury; she provides a break from the terminal frat-house humor. The movie could have used more of her (or others like her). Speaking of duration like all movie comedies these days this one is 15 minutes too long. The filmmaking itself is disarmingly amusing hitting grace notes amid the grandiosity. In this movies pothead vision of Deluxe Hollywood created on Louisiana soundstages the first signs of apocalypse break out on a commercial street where a single forlorn palm tree tips over. Disneys ""Night on Bald Mountain"" from ""Fantasia"" influences the ultimate demon more than ""Alien"" does - though the Satan in ""This Is the End"" is endowed in ways Uncle Walt would never have permitted. The bonhomie as well as the skill of the actors keeps you smiling. There is something infectious about being in the company of people having a good time even if you dont share their sensibility. And they bring out the scat rhythms in scatology. Franco throws himself into a funhouse-mirror version of himself a poseur who can pontificate about a Subway sandwich as a work of art. Rogen manages to be semi-smart in perilously fuzzy ways - he defines ""gluten"" as anything bad for you then blissfully pigs out at Carls Jr. Baruchel pulls off the dual function of being a surrogate for anyone who doesnt find these guys amusing while being a different kind of clown himself alternately insecure and smug. Jonah Hill plays himself as the kind of guy who makes ""niceness"" a goal because he really isnt all that nice. And Robinson through some kind of musical alchemy makes good nature and fellow feeling risible as well as lovable. Thanks to their group chemistry and Rogens instinctive evil genius ""This Is the End"" turns effrontery into a contagious comic style - though at times its contagious like a swinish flu. In its peak moments its as bold as ""Borat."" Contact the writer msragowocregister.com Most Popular Woman critical after being hit by vehicle in Costa MesaU.S. Open of Surfing Will you marry me?

(AP Photo/Columbia Pictures - Sony Suzanne Hanover) Photo Suzanne Hanover Image 9 of 9 This Is the End offers a fresh take on endtimes -- and plenty of laughs 1 / 9 Back to Gallery Many people who plan to see ""This Is the End"" are going to see it no matter what the reviews are and no matter what the word-of-mouth says. The appeal of the movie is practically instinctive with them just as resistance to it is reflexive in others. And its those others who need convincing because ""This Is the End"" is genuinely imaginative and one of the funniest movies of the season. It takes place as the world is coming to an end and stars Seth Rogen James Franco Jonah Hill and about a dozen other young celebrities playing themselves in roles big and small. Thats the hitch that whole playing-themselves thing. In the last 10 years or so it has become a cliche for celebrities to portray themselves on screen as vain ridiculous and obnoxious in fake gestures of self-deprecation that really are designed to say the opposite ""Obviously to send myself up as a jerk I couldnt possibly be a jerk. Im really a wonderful person at least as wonderful as we both think I am."" Rogen and Evan Goldberg who wrote and directed ""This Is the End"" dont subvert this recent tendency. Rather they overcome it by diving deep into it. And so Michael Cera for example appears as a coked out sexually rapacious version of himself who stands in a bathroom unfazed as two young women perform two different kinds of oral sex on him simultaneously. (Well leave the explanation at that.) Rogen and Goldberg go bigger and wilder throughout until their willingness to keep going to extremes becomes the opposite of obnoxious. It feels more like goodwill a generous effort to entertain the audience at every turn. More Information  Review""This Is the End""Rated R for crude and sexual content throughout brief graphic nudity pervasive language drug use and some violenceLength 107 minutes Excellent  Good  Fair  Poor ""This Is the End"" takes place in the near future maybe tomorrow or later today Rogen picks up his childhood friend Jay Baruchel at the airport and they go back to his house where they smoke so much pot that they dont even register the latest news that a sinkhole has opened up and swallowed half of Guatemala. Instead they go off to a party at the house of James Franco who presents himself here as someone without a thought in his head. Everybody who is young and famous is partying at Francos including Emma Watson from ""Harry Potter"" (in a very funny cameo) the singer Rihanna and Christopher Mintz-Plasse (""Kick-Ass"") who worries about contamination after Michael Cera blows a handful of cocaine in his face. Then bad things start happening to not-very-nice people. The righteous are swooped up into the sky in a celestial ray of love while everybody at Francos house keeps celebrating like its 1999. If only it were. But no its 2013 and time has run out. Though ""This Is the End"" drags slightly here and there the filmmakers keep it interesting by making the personal relationships dynamic and the movie redeems all that is self-referential and self-congratulatory about it with a warmth of spirit. mlasallesfchronicle.com Todays Deals NFL Caps at Lids for 10 + free shipping w/ 50 GNC Mega Men Sport 90-Count Multivitamins for 9 + free shipping Refurb Astak Wireless Surveillance Camera Kit for 50 + free... 4-Panel Abstract Wall Art by Jon Allen for 145 + free shipping Powered by Lifestyle Videos Most Popular 1 Five charged after fatal Lake George boat crash 2 Son of Greenwich billionaire charged with possession... 3 One town 35 chiefs 4 Couple arrested outside DJs Nightclub in Lake George 5 Patient St. Peters gave me other peoples medical records 6 After deadly boat crash officials eye end to Log Bay Day 7 Colonies iconic L-Kens sign to go to ex-owners daughter View Comments (c) 2016 Hearst Communications Inc.

Comments (6) click to enlarge This Is the End Recommended Video Watch on Amazon Rated R  107 minutes  2013 Playing themselves Seth Rogen and Jay Baruchel attend a party for all their hip ironic actor friends at the Hollywood home of James Franco but the festivities are interrupted by a strictly biblical apocalypse that leaves the aforementioned barricaded inside with Craig Robinson Danny McBride and Jonah Hill. This is the third feature written by Rogen and Evan Goldberg and easily their best since Superbad (2007); their big joke is to literalize the Book of Revelation but snaking around this is a biting contempt for the entertainment business their own bad movies and the social privilege these confer which turns out to be not much help when the earth is opening up. If youve ever wanted to see Michael Cera impaled by a street lamp or Channing Tatum kept as a sex slave by survivalists this is the movie for you. (It was for me.) Rogen and Goldberg directed.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Were Seth Rogen James Franco and every other member of the Judd Apatow entourage to part ways tomorrow vowing never to work together again This Is The End would be a fitting swan song for the loose comic collective. Thats not to say that its the best or funniest movie the Apatow boys have ever made or even that its a very good movie in any traditional sense of the word. It just feels like the Apatow movie--an all-hands-on-deck jamboree in which every actor not only plays himself but also seems to be offering a thesis statement on the kind of character he might normally play in an Apatow movie. Its a six-way bromance thats also an anti-bromance a feature-length in-joke and an anything-goes mash-up of comedic styles. (The humor is at once verbal physical satirical referential scatological and surrealist.) The sense of finality is overwhelming--and not just because this is after all a farce about the end of the world. In terms of pure hilarity the film peaks early with a sprawling party scene thats really just a parade of inspired cameos. Seth Rogen has dragged longtime buddy Jay Baruchel--cast here as a wet-blanket version of himself uncomfortable with Rogens famous posse of new friends--to an epic shindig at Francos house. Almost every guest at the bash is a familiar face and for a while the movie operates like a fast flip savaging of Hollywood egos with each celebrity walk-on providing a new hit of pleasure. (Funniest in show a coke-snorting pussy-hounding Michael Cera taking a torch to his typecasting.) Then the sky starts raining fire and the earth splits open swallowing up 90 percent of the supporting cast and leaving behind only Rogen Baruchel Franco Jonah Hill Craig Robinson and a secret stowaway who quickly becomes the films de facto villain. Trapped inside an L.A. mansion during the Rapture the six stars bicker over junk food pitch sequel ideas to each other and occasionally outrun one of the hellish beasts circling their luxury fortress. This Is The End was penned by Rogen and his writing partner Evan Goldberg who basically split the difference between their dumbest script (The Green Hornet) and their smartest one (Superbad). Asinine slapstick rubs shoulders with outrageous parody--including a bonkers Rosemarys Baby gag--and first-rate likely improvised banter. For the first time Rogen and Goldberg also direct and their greenness is painfully obvious. (In fact the duo is hapless enough behind the camera to make this reviewer pine for the stoner-comedy stylings of a slumming David Gordon Green.) The effects including a sprinting hellhound straight out of Ghostbusters are elaborate but awful. The performances are better though only Jonah Hill seems to be doing more then leaning on his usual shtick--and the ""character"" he comes up with isnt especially amusing. If theres a central joke holding the movie together its that it takes a literal apocalypse for these pampered entertainers to realize that (a) theyre pretty lousy people and (b) they dont really like each other. Had the filmmakers followed that idea to its natural conclusion This Is The End might have transformed into something truly daring--an honest-to-God critique of the man-child universe Apatow and his army of actors have built over the last decade. But theres just too much love going around here; by asking audiences to pony up to a glorified hang-out session Rogen and company cross the fine line between self-deprecation and self-indulgence. All that being said funny is funny and it would be truly dishonest to deny the big laughs--the spikes of gut-busting inspiration--that the film sporadically delivers. (To reiterate Theres an insane Rosemarys Baby spoof.) Heres hoping this isnt the end of the Apatow era even if it feels like an appropriately climactic punctuation.

Sony Pictures This Is the End Director Evan Goldberg Seth Rogen Genre Action Comedy Running Time 107 minutes Rated R for crude and sexual content brief graphic nudity pervasive language drug use and some language. With James Franco Jonah Hill Seth Rogen (Recommended) Watch Clips From This Is the End - Its Like A Sleepover Its Like A Sleepover Credit Sony Pictures From This is the End - Its A Zombie Invasion Its A Zombie Invasion Credit Sony Pictures From This Is the End - The Power Of Christ Compels You The Power Of Christ Compels You Credit Sony Pictures So far the summers end-of-the-world movies (After Earth Oblivion) have mostly been provoking unintended yuks so its kind of a relief that this weeks offerings include one that actually means to be funny. That This Is the End actually is funny -- well thats even better especially as its playing cleverly enough with form to keep your brain occupied too. It opens with actor Seth Rogen waiting at the L.A. airport for his comedian buddy Jay Baruchel. And the first thing you hear is a passerby saying ""Hey Seth Rogen what up?"" Thats a cue Rogen and Baruchel are playing versions of themselves or at least versions of their public personas. So is practically everyone they know as we discover when they head to a party at James Francos house. Jonah Hill is there and The Offices Craig Robinson and Harry Potters Emma Watson. Mindy Kalings all hot-and-bothered about Michael Cera whos grabby and gross and behaving very badly. So OK you get the drift right? Hip young comics partying and poking fun at themselves. Then all hell breaks loose -- kind of literally. The ground opens up swallowing hundreds of celebs L.A. is basically in flames with hellfire both raining down and bubbling up and by the next morning the five remaining guys at the party -- Franco Rogen Baruchel Robinson and Hill as well as interloper Danny McBride -- have barricaded themselves inside. Taking stock of their supplies (loads of alcohol drugs and salty snacks plus a single Milky Way) they debate how to go forward (they all want the Milky Way); only then do they turn their attention to figuring out whats going on. Baruchel argues that it all feels awfully biblical and darned if hes not right. This being a Seth Rogen-James Franco film these guys are talking trash trashily enough to make George Carlin blush and thats even before the arrival of digital demons whore visibly horny to torment them. (The End is what youd call a haaaard ""R."") And as long as Rogen and his buddies are just riffing in character as self-involved crude obnoxious and hopefully exaggerated versions of themselves things stay pretty funny. Once everyone gets tied up in the plot this glorified slacker flick goes well slacker partly because the whole celebrity-cribs vibe flies out the window when things get special-effects beelzebubbly. That said Rogen and his pal Evan Goldberg who co-wrote and co-directed are clearly having fun giving you the feeling that both celebrity boundaries and filmmaking boundaries are being crossed. Thats a notion theyre tapping into lets note alongside other filmmakers right now. Sofia Coppolas The Bling Ring invades the homes of real celebrities for a story of teen thieves invading the homes of real celebrities and asks moviegoers to spend more time in Paris Hiltons closet than they probably spend in their own. (Something made easier by the fact that it looks to be the size of a two-bedroom apartment.) And a veritable whos who of French movie stars play themselves in Alain Resnais You Aint Seen Nothin Yet a story that has them watching other actors playing parts they once played. That film is far more interesting in concept and infinitely more elegant in execution than what Rogen and his buddies have cooked up in This Is the End -- but Ive gotta admit its not nearly as funny.

There were jabs and low blows but also a discernible level of respect between the actors or ""friends"" in the cast. It avoided many of the cliche jokes and scenarios that fill parodies like the Scary Movie franchise or most Sandler movies of the past decade. This Is The End was familiar but still original and incredibly entertaining. Easily one of the funniest movies of the decade. Great review Richard.

This Is the End (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review This Is the End (R) Being rich and famous wont protect you from the end of the world. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com6/12/2013 Editor rating 3 This Is the End is a marvelously sustained high-wire goof - a movie so nutty and daring so crazy and out-there that it feels like a low-budget independent except with big stars and a sizable budget. The movie marks the directorial debut of Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg who had previously collaborated as writers on Superbad and Pineapple Express. Their new movie has that same brash did-they-just-say-that? attitude only this one takes it to apocalyptic extremes - literally. All the actors in the movies play themselves attending an enormous party at James Francos mansion. Among them are Rogen and his longtime friend Jay Baruchel (Shes Outta My League) who is visiting from Canada (the two are real-life pals; Baruchel has often appeared in small roles in Rogens movies). Jay doesnt really want to go to the party - hes come to L.A. to catch up with his friend - but Rogen drags him along promising hell have a good time. The party is filled with celebrities - Craig Robinson Jonah Hill Emma Watson Rihanna Christopher Mintz-Plasse Kevin Hart Aziz Ansari Paul Rudd - most of them playing things relatively straight (Michael Cera is a notable exception portrayed as a cokehead sex addict who likes blowing cocaine into peoples faces without warning). The gathering looks and feels realistic This is probably the way young and beautiful rich people socialize when theyre alone together. Then reminiscent of Cloverfield a sudden series of apocalyptic events put a damper on the festivities. Giant sinkholes open in the ground sucking many partygoers into the pits of hell screaming on their way down (there is something intangibly funny about watching say The Offices Mindy Kaling plunge to her doom). The Hollywood Hills burn in the distance. With no Internet or TV access the surviving characters hole up inside Francos fortress hoping to ride the storm out. But things just keep getting worse and friendships start to lose their value when its every man for himself. A lot of the comedy in This Is the End comes from watching the actors play versions of themselves that arent too far removed from their public personas. There is a sense of liberation in the movie - the happiness of actors given the freedom to be as creative as they can and not have to follow formula rules. As the days stretch on and food and water supplies start to dwindle the mood in the house becomes edgy. A perfectly cast Danny McBride who has always excelled at funny cretins shows up looking for shelter (hes miffed that he wasnt invited to the party). With no way to entertain themselves the gang takes copious amounts of drugs resulting in a visually striking representation of what it feels to be on hallucinogens. They talk about how lucky they are to be overpaid actors while real people have jobs and there is some diss  about how Rogen has sold out by making movies like The Green Hornet. And just when things start to drag a little This Is the End pays vulgar homage to Rosemarys Baby and the monsters arrive leading to situations such as a gross-out soccer game with a severed head. Like many of the movies Rogen and Goldberg have written This is the End seems to have conceived while under the influence riffing on ridiculous situations the actors make funny (among them a four-minute sequel to Pineapple Express). The energy lags a bit in the middle of the movie which could have lost 10 minutes. But once the third act kicks in This Is the End starts springing surprises on you with a couple of genuine jolts and bits of real horror (and the years greatest cameo). Rogen and Goldberg have pulled off some impressive end-of-the-world Biblical sights - the special effects work will impress you - making the intrinsically nature of the movie all the funnier. This Is the End is both sweet and revolting and it ends with a coda that only a grinch (or boyband hater) could despise. Youve never seen anything like this one guaranteed - and you probably never will. Cast James Franco Jonah Hill Seth Rogen Jay Baruchel Danny McBride Craig Robinson Emma Watson.

Subscribe Sign InSubscribe Review This Is the End Apocalypse Like Wow Young Hollywood plays itself in Seth Rogen and Evan Goldbergs raunchy hilarious comedy By Mary Pols MaryPolsJune 11 2013 Share Read Later Send to Kindle Suzanne Hanover / Columbia Pictures Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture I see a lot of comedies every year. Many arent particularly funny. But Im happy if there is even one that makes me laugh so hard the laughs replicate and snowball until the exact source of the original eruption couldnt possibly be located. Thats the sweet spot when youre laughing because youre laughing. This Is the End a meta-Hollywood story that takes place mostly at James Francos house--during the Apocalypse--is my sweet-spot comedy for 2013. It is intensely raunchy and silly and joyous and it tapped right into my inner teenager in a glorious way. Its Tropic Thunder crossed with Shaun of the Dead with just a dollop of Being John Malkovich. This Is the End opens with Jay Baruchel playing himself arriving in Los Angeles for a weekend with his old friend fellow Canadian and onscreen roommate from Knocked Up Seth Rogen. Rogen is also playing himself. A paparazzo at LAX gets right in Rogens face with his camera ""You like play the same guy in every movie. When are you going to do something else?"" That certainly wont happen in this movie in which all the actors in the movie play themselves or rather the public perception of themselves. The ""cast"" includes Rihanna Emma Watson Michael Cera Mindy Kaling and Danny McBride who starred in Pineapple Express (alongside Rogen) and Tropic Thunder (with Baruchel). (READ Richard Corliss on Superbad.) Without at least a passing knowledge of the young guns of Hollywood comedy (or the world of Judd Apatow which produced many of these stars) This Is the End could be bewildering. Instead of tapping into an inner teen it might tap into an inner Andy Rooney. I say this as a word of warning because when Ive favorably reviewed this kind of total young-dude comedy in the past Ive heard from irate readers who swear that I must have been high if I found this garbage entertaining. (I distinctly remember those e-mails after reviewing Pineapple Express and Old School.) Thats never been true but it is likely that these readers are more mature than I. The stage is set for the perfect stoner bromance. Rogen who co-wrote and co-directed the film with Evan Goldberg leads Baruchel into his living room and invites him to admire the assorted bags of weed a new 3-D television a comprehensive collection of video games and a wide array of junk food. But as evening approaches he reveals he wants to go to a party at Francos house. Baruchel goes grudgingly; he is positioned as the outsider who thinks Los Angeles is shallow. He communicates his disdain for L.A. even to Francos famous party guests. ""I bet you hate movies that are universally loved"" Craig Robinson says while Emma Watson casts disappointed glances at him. And yes Baruchel thinks Forrest Gump is an abomination. (READ Populist 10 Ways Hollywood Has Ended the World) Nor does he like Jonah Hill. And the Jonah Hill that Jonah Hill plays here--so smug from that Supporting Actor Oscar nomination that when he addresses God in prayer he says ""Its Jonah Hill from Moneyball""--is a perfectly reasonable person to hate. Baruchel is not fond of Franco either. As soon as Judgment Day declares itself--with earthquakes sinkholes and the lucky raptured ones being beamed up to the heavens in columns of blue light Baruchel tells Rogen ""I dont want to die at James Francos house."" But theres nowhere else to go. Most of the famous guests are quickly dispatched; the comedy around Ceras demise is brutally funny. The remaining crew--Rogen Baruchel Franco Hill Robinson and McBride--hole up in the mansion while Los Angeles burns around them. Heads roll. There are Survivor references. The devil arrives (and is well endowed). There are lengthy discussions of masturbation and who among them might be most considered to be ""rapey"" during the Apocalypse. And then there are conversations about careers and status--done in a manner thats charmingly self-deprecating. Franco in a performance that might win him new fans or woo back some old ones is mocked nonstop for his ego for his pretentiousness and even about his often questioned sexuality (although not about what a crappy Oscar host he was). (READ About that time Jonah Hill babysat for Joel Stein. That is Joels kid.) The movies these guys have made are all fair game. When they get bored they shoot a sequel to Pineapple Express and have so much fun they decide to make sequels of all their movies. Except Franco says ""How about we not do Your Highness 2?"" Agreed. And maybe avoid making This Is the End 2 despite how enjoyable this one is. It is almost inevitable that a gag like this will run out of steam or get bogged down in the part of the plot that involves something beyond dissing each other. (""Michael Ceras dead?"" McBride says when hes informed that the end is nigh. ""Not a total loss."") The last 10 or 15 minutes of This Is the End sag until Rogen and Goldberg trot out a few last sublime celebrity cameos. Thats O.K. though; by that point I was so weak with laughter I needed to rest. (READ About how much we hated Your Highness as well) Mary Pols MaryPols Mary Pols has been reviewing film and occasionally books for TIME since 2009. She has degrees from Duke University where she studied art history and the University of California Berkeleys School of Journalism. She is the author of a memoir about untraditional parenthood.

Theres a party at James Francos house and Francos playing himself -- as are Jonah Hill Seth Rogen Jay Baruchel Danny McBride Rihanna and many other names. Then the earth opens up the Hollywood Hills burst into flame and the end times are upon us. (Sadly we dont get to see what happens to the agents.)

Theres a certain grade of contemporary movie comedy that feels a lot like a ""Saturday Night Live"" celebrity sketch pumped up to 100 minutes or so. OK youre right - thats actually almost every Hollywood comedy of the last 30 years. But ""This Is the End"" in which a bro-pack of young Hollywood dudes playing themselves as weed-smoking self-absorbed idiots face the apocalypse at James Francos house (where else would it hit?) is the ne plus ultra of such films. Its the best and funniest and most absurd and outrageous and self-referential of all high-concept stars-playing-themselves Jewish Rapture movies ever made. Which is a long way of saying that I enjoyed the hell out of it for a while but it got irritating and self-congratulatory long before it was over and I desperately do not want to see it again.Im all in favor of movie stars making jokes at their own expense but an entire movie based on that premise starts to seem like a suspiciously large amount of upside-down vanity. Nearly the first half of ""This Is the End"" plays like an uproarious game of Can You Top This? mixed with a lost episode of ""Entourage"" with Franco as the pompous aesthete hosting a debauched party in a sterile Hollywood Hills mansion furnished with ghastly postmodern art some of it his own creations. (No its not really his house - the film was shot in New Orleans mysteriously.) Any number of approximately famous people are in attendance Michael Cera is a lecherous cokehead (who gets slapped by Rihanna); Emma Watson is belligerent and touchy; comic Craig Robinson sports a T-shirt that says ""TAKE YO PANTIES OFF.""Seth Rogen who co-directed and co-wrote the film with Evan Goldberg (based on the 2007 short ""Jay and Seth vs. the Apocalypse"") plays himself as a genial dim pothead whos dragging his reluctant old friend Canadian actor Jay Baruchel to Francos shindig. Everyone at the party is just a little too conscious of being nice to Seths not-so-famous friend from the northlands especially Jonah Hill who gives the movies most skin-crawly performance as a fussy diva-ish collection of positive thinking and New Age wisdom. But when the largest earthquake in history strikes L.A. and Mindy Kaling David Krumholtz and numerous minor celebrities get sucked into a bottomless sinkhole in Francos front yard - theres always a silver lining - its only Baruchel who understands whats really going on. Its time not merely to take yo panties off but also to prepare to meet yo maker.For some reason the arrival of Judgment Day does not involve cutting off the gas and electricity to James Francos house. I guess God is sparing these guys for a while so they can shoot a home-video sequel to ""Pineapple Express"" (actually pretty funny with Hill playing Woody Harrelson) using Francos prop camera from ""127 Hours."" (Mercifully they agree not to make a sequel to ""Your Highness"" which would make my short list of worst movies of the 21st century so far.) Or so Danny McBride can show up in the role of mysterious survivor with a hidden agenda and cook up nearly all the remaining food in a show of faux-generosity. Ive never been able to stand McBrides obnoxious public persona and I guess Im not alone. His character in ""This Is the End"" is genuinely troubling the disturbed aggressive almost-friend whos a little too willing to discuss the ""rapey vibe"" that emerges around Emma Watsons unexpected reappearance. (Dont worry; she fends for herself just fine.) You Might Also Like As ""This Is the End"" clicks along toward its intentionally ludicrous demon-packed action finale you can feel the central group - Franco Hill Rogen Baruchel McBride and Robinson a little too obviously playing the ""token black guy"" of horror-movie lore - daring each other to go further. Which of them is willing to seem the gayest? (A tight race between Franco and Hill.) Which one will be the biggest pants-crapping coward? (That would be Rogen.) After Hill is visited at night by a growling demon with an enormous tumescent member - an experience he describes as ""not chill"" - we take an extended detour into ""Exorcist"" parody but its no good claiming that the movie falls apart or jumps the shark or anything like that. There was nothing to fall apart from no shark and not even really a movie just a big load of steaming semi-enjoyable Kentucky Fried meta-meta-ness. As idiotic summer entertainment goes why the hell not? ""This Is the End"" knows its being idiotic the entire time and never aspires to anything more. It delivers some reasonably good hard-R laughs without descending into the ickiest grade of contemporary humor (although I dont know what to say about Channing Tatums late-movie cameo). Rogen and Goldberg want you to notice that theyre a couple of Jewish guys making a movie in which the Christian version of the Rapture comes all too literally true but they dont want to go further than that. (At least the vision of heaven in this movie looks a lot more fun than the ascetic beachfront wasteland seen in ""The Tree of Life."") Theres a prankish DIY sensibility here that suggests the Rogen-Goldberg duo may be worthy heirs to their pal Judd Apatows mantle but only once they get past the idea that its awesome to be young rich and famous and that nothing could possibly supersede the awesomeness of hanging out with them and their young rich famous friends.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 850 p.m. EDT June 11 2013Yes its raunchy and outrageous but the gags add up to a viable laugh-filled story of camaraderie and cataclysm.James Franco left Jonah Hill Craig Robinson Seth Rogen Jay Baruchel and Danny McBride face the apocalypse in the uneven but entertaining This Is the End.(Photo Columbia Pictures)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY Review  out of fourStars Seth Rogen James Franco Jonah Hill Craig Robinson Danny McBride Jay Baruchel Emma WatsonRated R; Runtime 1 hour 47 minutes; Opens Wednesday nationwideThe best thing about the Seth Rogen/Evan Goldberg apocalypse comedy This Is the End is its clever way with self-parody.Less consistent is its embrace of audacious humor inane stoner comedy and slapstick antics including but not limited to gross-out jokes.The film ( out of four; rated R; opens Wednesday nationwide) is uneven and about 15 minutes too long. But when its funny its hilarious. End hits all the right notes in its gleeful send-up of celebrity entitlement. Its particularly fun to watch these actors -- the cornerstone of Judd Apatow comedies -- poke fun at their public images.The tale focuses on a group of actor pals -- playing exaggerated versions of themselves -- on the night of the apocalypse. As the world comes crashing down these self-involved guys are hunkered down in James Francos sprawling ultra-modern Los Angeles bachelor pad. Eventually things inside its walls implode too.Fights over rations are nothing compared to the thunderous clash of skyrocketing celebrity egos. One of the six becomes possessed by Satan. Or were they all already?STORY Good friends made This Is the End into a real partyVIDEO End cast shares their vicesMORE Seth Rogen talks The End front to backREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYThe audience is likely to identify with Jay Baruchels character an actor based in Canada. Hes in town briefly planning to spend a low-key weekend re-connecting with his old pal Seth Rogen (who co-wrote and co-directed this film along with his Superbad writing partner Evan Goldberg). Rogen suggests they attend a party at Francos house. Baruchel resists pointing out how Franco rarely gets his name right. Plus Baruchel dislikes most of the young egomaniacs Franco hangs with. But Rogen prevails and Baruchel reluctantly goes along.The party is what mere mortals expect from a hip gathering of young Hollywood elite. Everyone from Rihanna to Harry Potters Emma Watson shows up.Rogen and Baruchel leave the party briefly for a liquor store run and find themselves in the midst of what seems like an earthquake. Armageddon looms. Only Baruchel seems to grasp the essence of what they just experienced.When more catastrophe strikes revelers flee the house leaving only Franco Jonah Hill Rogen Baruchel and Craig Robinson indoors. Soon Danny McBride shows up and dials up the crude mayhem. We also get cameos from Paul Rudd Aziz Ansari and Jason Segel who are among the unfortunate masses tumbling into sinkholes one of which is dubbed ""Sinkhole de Mayo.""This is not a movie for the easily offended. Accusations of ""rapey vibes"" and Franco and McBride proposing an auto-erotic competition could put some people off.But its an inspired idea blending a disaster movie with a wacked-out comic bromance in which actors portray caricatures of themselves.Franco plays a pretentious intellectual and Rogen an unabashed pothead. Hill pretends to be a nice guy but hes knee-deep in arrogance. Some portrayals turn public perceptions on their head. Soft-spoken Michael Cera plays a lascivious coke-addled jerk.Friendships are tested. Eventually the guys must face the cataclysm outdoors where their varying fates await them. Redemption might be in the cards -- or not.But hearty laughter along with the end is nigh. 104 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 18 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/13zioRNSummer Movies Calendar JuneTake a look at the films heading to the box office this June complete with trailers reviews clips related stories and more.

Photo Credit Columbia Pictures advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A really fun party at James Francos house is interrupted by the apocalypse. BOTTOM LINE ""Superbad"" meets ""The Player"" in this raunchy Hollywood satire which lets you bro down with the Frat Pack and make fun of them too. CAST Seth Rogan James Franco Jonah Hill Danny McBride Craig Robinson and Jay Baruchel DIRECTOR Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg ""Hey Seth Rogen What up man?"" The voice comes from an unseen admirer during the opening scene of ""This Is the End"" a comedy set in Los Angeles during the Rapture. Rogens polite reaction a grin-and-bear-it price-of-fame smile. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? ""This Is the End"" will go on to include decapitation cannibalism and various excreta but that little exchange between fan and star sets the tone for the movie. ""This Is the End"" is your chance -- especially if youre a 20-ish male -- to hang out with Rogen and a bromantic dream team of James Franco Jonah Hill Danny McBride Craig Robinson and Jay Baruchel all playing versions of themselves or at least of their personas. But these Hollywood types also portray themselves as the insulated overpaid undercontributing members of society that you sometimes suspect they are. The story begins during a cameo-filled shindig where Jason Segel is explaining sitcom drudgery to Kevin Hart and Rihanna is fending off a coked-up Michael Cera. After the party winds down -- literally -- a core group of survivors huddles in Francos modernist mansion (a set not his actual house). As rations dwindle and someone ruins the communal porno magazine loyalties begin to splinter. ""We could build a life together"" Baruchel tells Robinson. ""Id be really good to you."" ""This Is the End"" directed and written by Rogen and Evan Goldberg from their 2007 short ""Jay and Seth vs. the Apocalypse"" is such a dedicated bro-down that it barely acknowledges the existence of women (Emma Watson randomly enters then quickly exits). Oddly thats a strength. With no outsiders to coddle this tight-knit ensemble locks into a groove and reaches some truly giddy heights turning even the weakest material (a spoof of ""The Exorcist"") into anarchic fun. They also wisely mix the meta-jokes with actual jokes that would work even without the boldface names. 209 MoviesThis is the End trailer Still its the ongoing friction between fan worship and schadenfreude that gives the movie its edge. advertisement | advertise on newsday ""Relax"" Hill says while Southern California goes up in flames.

Related links Buddies recruit friends for This Is the End By Cary Darlingdfw.comPosted 550pm on Tuesday Jun. 11 2013 Tuesday Jun. 11 2013 Tuesday Jun. 11 2013 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram The world wont end with just a bang or a whimper but also a truckload of sophomoric humor and Hollywood in-jokes. At least thats the way Seth Rogen and a bunch of his movie-star buddies see it in This Is the End a riff on the apocalypse thats closer in spirit to Harold amp; Kumar than Genesis and Revelations.Directed and written by Rogen and friend Evan Goldberg (who wrote Pineapple Express) and based on a short film by Jason Stone This Is the End is one extended meta joke about stardom and celebrity that goes on too long and gets derailed by the pairs desire to keep upping the level of comedic absurdity and cheesy special effects. Still there are lots of low-brow laughs especially in the first half.As with everyone else in the film Rogen plays himself or at least a crude caricature of his geeky persona. He has invited Jay Baruchel (Tropic Thunder) an actor friend and fellow Canadian to L.A. for some down time. They head over to James Francos new place for a house party and thats where the whole crew -- Franco Jonah Hill Craig Robinson Rihanna Michael Cera Emma Watson Mindy Kaling Christopher Mintz-Plasse Aziz Ansari Danny McBride Paul Rudd basically anyone who has ever walked by a Judd Apatow set -- is ready to have a good time.But then the Rapture happens (Spoiler alert None of the celebs gets called to heaven) massive quakes reduce L.A. to rubble and Seth Jay Craig James Danny and Jonah are left to fend for themselves amid an atmosphere of camaraderie cowardice and cracks about each others movies.The film is at its buddy-movie Hollywood-skewering best when staying on the human level. Even the usually repellent McBride has a few good lines.Yet as events become more supernatural This Is the End spirals into over-the-top silliness -- Hill getting possessed probably sounded good on paper -- as Seth and Jay struggle to find a way to get into heaven. Its as if Rogen and Goldberg making their directing debut couldnt keep up the conceit.Its an apocalypse of a different sort for filmmakers when they run out of ideas long before their movie ends.

Starring Seth Rogen Jay Baruchel Jonah Hill James Franco Danny McBride Craig Robinson and Emma Watson. Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Judgment Day comes to Hollywood with a vengeance in ""This Is the End."" Jonah Hill is in bed with the devil -- in James Francos mansion. An inferno rages in the front yard and movie star egos are filleted for fun. When the apocalyptic comedy gets deadly serious about roasting the ethos of celebrity its satire grows white-hot.As the devils brigade sets the Hollywood Hills ablaze ""This Is the End"" considers many burning questions. Does movie-star cred automatically put one on the A-list of the blessed? Can a little bit of last-minute goodness buy salvation? Is Franco really that effete? In answering Seth Rogen and Evan Goldbergs script is scathing while their directing debut is a revelation.PHOTOS This Is The End premiere The two set their course for crude-and-unusual humor long ago. At age 15 they wrote what would become a decade later their breakout ""Superbads"" very funny nerd walk on the wild side in 2007. ""This Is the End"" continues the pairs fish-in-very-hot-water tradition though these babies are burned to a crisp. Its almost enough to extinguish any bad taste left by the flameout of ""Pineapple Express."" Almost.For ""This Is the End"" Rogen and Goldberg have invited most of the actors in their clique to the party. The humor is of the cage-fighting variety everyone playing an extreme version of themselves.Rogen Franco and Hill are joined on-screen by Jay Baruchel Danny McBride and Craig Robinson. There are countless high-profile walk-on puns -- the fun is like Waldo in finding them. Two you cant miss are Michael Cera and Emma Watson playing against type in superbad ways.""The End"" begins inauspiciously. Rogen is picking up Baruchel at LAX and Baruchel is not all that happy to be on the West Coast. Hes not a fan of the vacuous Los Angeles vibe. The Montreal-based actor drops ""Canadians are nicer"" faster than Hill does names. In spite of that the visit goes swimmingly for a while. Like bad choir boys Baruchel and Rogen do some drugs play some video games consume some junk food and giggle a lot in Rogens nicely tricked-out pad.PHOTOS Hollywood backlot momentsThen the specter of going to a ""James Franco party"" rises like a storm cloud.Hellfire rains down a bit later. First theres friendly grousing about the Hollywood lifestyle on the way to Francos stunning contemporary mansion in the hills. That the house in all its ostentation sits with the city at its feet is only one delineation of the continental divide the movie toys with between them and us.At Francos a celebrity-packed bacchanal is underway but the actor is happy to give a quick tour of his avant-garde art collection -- his self-deprecation simply simpering. Hill is more simper-fi. One of the central running jokes is about the bonds of friendship -- what makes it and breaks it in Hollywood terms -- and Hill drew the sycophant card.The Franco-Rogen relationship is the funniest the Rogen-Baruchel the deepest the McBride-and-everyone else the deadliest and the Robinson-et al. the sweetest. Each is heavily weighted with irony and each hangs in the balance. Everyone does a solid job of playing their hyper-realized selves although Hill has said hes never slipped out of character more.There is a lot of outright insanity as the final hours unfold in classic horror movie style. But the filmmakers and their crew prove quite agile at walking the fine line between visually intriguing and schlock including cinematographer Brandon Trost production designer Chris Spellman and visual effects supervisor Paul Linden.FULL COVERAGE Los Angeles Times movie reviewsThe destruction so closely mirrors predictions in the Book of Revelation if not for the scandalous behavior the film would probably appeal to a very unlikely subset of the population. But a word of warning If excessive F-bombs and explicit language graphic discussions and depictions of sex and drugs and an extremely well-endowed devil who goes full Monty are likely to bother you ""This Is the End"" is not for you.However if you are in a forgiving mood the movie is a surprisingly relevant guilty pleasure an incisive riff on the culture and the cult of the rich and famous.Its all set to an appropriately ominous yet cheeky score starting with composer Henry Jackmans classical-house music mash-up an ironic soundtrack supervised by Jonathan Karp and a few racy ditties from a piano-playing Robinson -- ""Take Yo Panties Off"" the most um memorable.Even within the madness you can always feel the method. Goldberg and Rogens comic form is a tangy brew of high-brow thinking Stooges slapstick and hard-R language that somehow works.From the clockwork comic timing to the movies salty mix of the ridiculous and the reflective ""This Is the End"" is stupidly hysterical and smartly heretical. Cross my heart and hope to die its funny as hell. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Seth Rogen James Franco This Is the End Entertainment Movies Jazz Jonah Hill This Is the End premiere Movie review Google crashers join Internet age in The Internship Palm Springs International ShortFest lines up 330 films Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad84deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-this-is-the-end-review-20130612,0,2661345.story",200,thisistheend24,thisistheend,latimes

Since we like to forgive and we like to like the stars who make us laugh this has proven profitable--audiences can relish in the bad behavior and then take comfort in the restoration of something like a crackpot decency. But its hampered the range of movie comedy. Even as the language has grown more flamboyantly obscene and exposed junk has become the new red-heart boxer shorts the comic form itself has rarely been less anarchic. What bite could The Campaign have when we know that in the end Will Ferrels baby-punching wife-poaching candidate will prove as apple-pie pure as a Capra Boy Scout?Perhaps wrath-of-God hang-out flick This Is the End can kill redemption cold. A deeply nondenominational Left Behind rip the film--written and directed by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg the stars longtime writing partner--makes absurdly literal the prick-becomes-a-man plotting that has held sway since Billy Madison. Here its judgment day and our schlubby everydudes (playing themselves who arent everydudes at all) are holed up for the apocalypse in James Francos compound. After much violent misadventure and even more talk of where its appropriate to ejaculate the lugs--including Rogen Jay Baruchel Jonah Hill Craig Robinson and Franco--realize the obvious Good people have already been raptured and these guys havent. (""Im an actor"" one moans in disbelief. ""I bring people joy"") If they want a happy ending and not to be devoured by horizon-straddling hellbeasts with schoolbus-sized phalluses theyll have to do the thing the heroes in lazy movie comedies always do stop being dicks and give the universe a reason to love them. To Rogen and Goldbergs credit this does seem parodic.Whether they win that love Ill leave to you. I laughed a lot but this is one of those films where a list of its ingredients should tell you whether youll find it delectable or poisonous. For all its Book of Revelation trappings at heart its a loose hard-R comedy full of funny dudes running amok in a mansion the jokes often just the dudes scabrous one-upping of each other on MPAA-baiting topics that will seem outrageous to anyone whos never heard comedians or 12-year-olds talk among themselves. Discussed here with a touch too much aint-we-daring? self-congratulations sharting the titty-fucking of overweight men the unstoppable epic-ness of Danny McBrides masturbation.Film Details This Is The End RatingR GenreComedy Running Time107 More Info This is all performed with brio by likable performers with expert timing ace chemistry and a directing team eager to let them tear loose. But it can wear you down. By the time McBride turns up with a hooded man-slave and hollers ""Ill butt-fuck him right here"" all I could think of was the little old lady that comedian Rick Jenkins describes taking down a shock comic at Bostons Comedy Studio ""You should try for more"" she heckled.Still at its best which is often the movie does try for more. A pre-cataclysm party at Francos is more fun than the bashes at Baz Luhrmanns Gatsbys chockablock with stars acting out Michael Cera goes riotously coke-mad; Craig Robinson serenades Rihannas panties; and Baruchel treats us to a winning shy-dude turn reminiscent of his itchy appealing work years back on Judd Apatows TV college comedy Undeclared. When all the cock-talk lets up Rogen and Goldberg parade before us memorable surprises. There are ridiculous cameos (Emma Watson spits ""fuck"" like the word still means something) shock-effect horror kills (often of those cameo-ing actors) and stoned riffs on The Exorcist and Pineapple Express each part parody and part Be Kind Rewind-style sweding.Especially pleasurable are the light hilarious gags on the cluelessness of Hollywood actors especially from Jonah Hill who has rarely been this disarming. Praying he mentions to God that that yes he was in Moneyball; his idea of a compliment delivered with full sincerity after Jay Baruchel mentions some bit of pop-culutral detritus is to marvel ""sick reference.""The survival situations and dopey metaphysics are smartly worked out and they too build to satisfying laughs especially the gentler stuff like when the boys all tuck in next to each other. (For a movie as penis-obsessed as this one is theres refreshingly little gay-panic talk; only McBride indulges and hes meant to be irredeemable.) Theres even some affecting character work. Rogen and Baruchels friendship gets tested which naturally figures into that third-act turn toward godliness; surprisingly that friendship comes to seem like something the rest of us should value too much like the one in Superbad which Rogen and Goldberg also wrote.Unlike too many comedies This Is the End gets stronger as it goes especially when the cosmic finish tasks its cast with bigger things than talking about jacking off. In fact as Rogen and company strive for that grandest of all redemptions the movie seems both a culmination of and an elegy for the comedies that have made them rich Seriously after going this far both in raunchy bad-boyism and mock-apologetic love-us shamelessness theyve effectively blown up their own formula. Thats not a bad thing. This is the end; now its time to try for more.Follow VoiceFilmClub Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Alan Scherstuhl Follow studiesincrap Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

June 17 2013 -- 105pm Video (5838)  TV critic Neal Justin and film critic Colin Covert talk about ""This is the end"". Seth Rogen co-wrote and co-directed the gory comedy. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Colin Covert colincovert How long would it take to count the idiocies in ""This Is the End""? Fooled you Trick question. Numbers dont go that high. The badness of this smirky juvenile hard-R comedy is incalculable. This is a movie full of talented people who have entertained me in the past and who on some level I genuinely like. And theyre just dreadful. The premise is promising a warped take on disaster movies. On the night of a big party attended by half of young Hollywood earthquakes fires and horrific forces lay siege to the planet. Seth Rogen James Franco Jonah Hill Jay Baruchel Danny McBride and Craig Robinson plus a busload of junior varsity cameo players are put in mortal peril. Most die comically gruesome deaths. So far so good. But its all in the doing and the execution is excruciating. The stars playing twisted meta-comedy versions of themselves come across as whiny selfish blowhards. Yes the actors are lampooning their professions superficiality but its a delicate trick to play an egocentric drug-addled nitwit and keep the audience charmed. The plot is haphazard sparse and repetitive the gags-to-laughs ratio unforgivably low. Emma Watson appears for a five-minute supporting turn stirs the pot and vanishes. This is the opposite of ensemble comedy. Every actor seems to be sweating to come up with something funny on the spot. The results are lowbrow pseudo-risque and sad. There are at this late date Lindsay Lohan jokes. Rogen who co-wrote and co-directed this film with Evan Goldberg has spent the past several years renouncing his early sentimental Judd Apatow comedies. His output as a writer ranges from the sharp-witted teen farce ""Superbad"" to the migraine-inducing superhero flop ""Green Hornet"" to ""The Watch"" a crass sci-fi comedy about aliens in suburbia that practically dripped monster splatter. This effort recycles ideas from all those films improving none of them. In a scattershot movie like this which gives equal weight to dime-store theology male-bonding cliches and pee jokes you take your pleasures where you can. I liked the sound and fury of several comic action scenes. I enjoy Rogens lovable schlemiel shtick. I smiled at the childishly awful artworks adorning Francos museum-sized mansion. And who among us has not wanted to see Michael Cera impaled by a toppling telephone pole? Columbia Pictures James Franco Danny McBride and Craig Robinson in ""This Is the End."" The films key mistakes are to think that overblown equals funny and loud equals exciting. The misfired punch line is an epic eruption of brimstone and beasties that looks like a stoners vision of Gotterdammerung. Im not going to imply that drugs were involved in the making of this movie because I have no evidence that was the case. But feel free to judge the bad trip for yourself. ""This Is the End"" probably wont end any careers but it sure wont help. Colin Covert has covered films for the Star Tribune for 20 years interviewing Peter Jackson Kate Winslet Steven Spielberg Cate Blanchett Quentin Tarantino Neil Gaiman and John Travolta to name a few. Colins job as a film critic consists mostly of thinking up synonyms for ""mediocre."" He still gets a thrill when the lights dim and all too often a bigger thrill when they come on again.

(AP Photo/Columbia Pictures - Sony Suzanne Hanover) Suzanne Hanover This film publicity image released by Columbia Pictures shows from left James Franco Seth Rogen and Jay Baruchel in a scene from ""This Is The End."" (AP Photo/Columbia Pictures - Sony Suzanne Hanover) Theres a vast and growing industry devoted to exposing the private lives of celebrities. Even in feature films behind-the-scenes peeks such as Casey Afflecks quasi-doc ""Im Still Here"" and Woody Allens fictionalized ""Stardust Memories"" are accepted as skeleton keys into the VIP room. But few movies have skewered celebrity privilege with as much glee as ""This Is the End."" Co-directed by Seth Rogen and starring several of his A-list friends as caricatured versions of themselves this gut-busting comedy is an intoxicating mix of ""Write what you know"" and ""Give the people what they want.""What many of us want is a ride in the limo and from the arrivals area at LAX Rogen takes us into the Hollywood Hills with his friend Jay Baruchel. Baruchel is living in New York and hopes to reconnect with Rogen who decorates his bachelor pad with fat joints spelling out his visitors name. But while Baruchel wants to mend an unspecific riff Rogen wants to tear up a party at James Francos mansion. If you read the tabloids you might know that in real life Franco lives in a cluttered bungalow in a hipster neighborhood but here his house is a space-age fortress filled with hard-partying young celebs and their groupies. So when the Earth trembles coke-addled cretins such as Michael Cera barely notice.Baruchel tries in vain to convince them its something more apocalyptic than an earthquake and after a sinkhole swallows a sizable portion of Hollywood the house becomes a refuge for a group that includes Baruchel Rogen Franco Craig Robinson Emma Watson and Jonah Hill. While the seemingly angelic Hill functions as a peacemaker in the negotiations for dividing the scant resources (including Watsons young flesh) boisterous late-arrival Danny McBride drags the survivors into ""Lord of the Flies"" territory. The R-rated script written by Rogen and co-director Evan Goldberg is packed with personality clashes and gross encounters of the third kind that somehow achieve liftoff.""This Is the End"" is a one-joke movie but its a joke whose recurring rimshots grow as loud as our laughter.What ""This Is the End""  Three and a half stars out of four  Rating R  Run time 147  Content Crude and sexual humor Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

Everyone at Francos gets left behind of course (silly sinful Tinseltownians) and after some fire-and-brimstone pruning only a scatterbrained sextet remains Franco Jonah Hill Seth Rogen Jay Baruchel Danny McBride and Craig Robinson all playing themselves. Can they somehow survive the end-times and maybe just maybe redeem their unrighteous souls? Youd think thered be no ungodlier vision than a literally cock-rocking Beelzebub wreaking havoc on downtown L.A. But then theres the sight of six talented comic performers contorting themselves to wring laughs from Rogen and Evan Goldbergs flabby directorial debut. Its a hit-and-mostly-miss affair For every gut-buster like McBride and Francos lengthy exchange about drenching each other in seminal fluid theres a fall-flat gag such as an improvised-into-oblivion riff on raping special guest star Emma Watson that quickly stifles the giggles. Providing a heavier drag are the films pseudo-serious attempts to mine pathos from Seth and Jays coolly distant friendship. If only these former bros-in-arms could learn to sacrifice a bit more then boys could finally become men and a heavenly chorus provided by the Backstreet Boys would sing them to their mutual rest.

Seth Rogen Jonah Hill Emma Watson and Aziz Ansari. (Suzanne Hanover) Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Tuesday June 11 2013 1010 AM Title This is the End Film Info With Seth Rogen James Franco Famous friends survive the Apocalypse. Directors Seth Rogen Evan Goldberg (147). R Sexuality nudity language drugs violence. Area theaters. Its no minor accomplishment to make one of the most indulgent projects in Hollywood history. But with ""This Is the End"" Seth Rogen and his pals have indeed achieved this dubious goal. Rogen James Franco Jonah Hill and their buddies play exaggerated versions of themselves all gathered at Francos L.A. mansion for a blowout bash studded with flashy cameos (Rihanna Emma Watson Mindy Kaling). The concept is that Jay Baruchel has just arrived in town and despite his deeply antisocial tendencies agrees to join Rogen at the party. Hes instantly miserable but things soon get a lot worse the Apocalypse has arrived and nearly everyone is either spirited heavenward or drawn toward the fiery pits below. Among those left behind are Baruchel Rogen Franco Hill Danny McBride and Craig Robinson who have to figure out how to survive while holed up in Francos house. While all of them are very good at pretending to have real-life skills none is particularly useful in an actual disaster. Like their previous stoner comedies (""Pineapple Express"" ""Your Highness"") this goofy collaboration -- written and directed by Rogen and Evan Goldberg -- veers toward extremes of hit or miss. At its riotous best the B-movie vibe is a blast with the guys willing to go all out for a laugh. From left James Franco Danny McBride and Craig Robinson find a hole in the script. (SMPSP) But theyre also so thrilled with themselves that the movie nearly drowns in a sea of smugness. Its fun at first when these famous faces tweak their own images. But is there really anything clever about Hill pointing out that hes an Oscar nominee? About Franco acknowledging that hes obscenely wealthy or McBride playing yet another clueless jerk? Even Michael Ceras turn as an aggressive cokehead would feel a lot wittier if he hadnt just done the same thing in ""The End of Love"" three months ago. The movie is filled with celebrity cameos like Rihanna (c.) (SMPSP) The truth is self-mockery is really just another form of self-congratulation; these guys can afford to make fun of themselves because as they repeatedly remind us theyre a lot more successful than the average ticket buyer. There are big laughs to be had here for sure. But dont be fooled by the in-joke vibe. They arent inviting you to their party; theyre inviting you to stand on the other side of the velvet rope to watch them have a blast in the VIP area. And whats more they expect you to subsidize the whole affair. On mobile?

RELATED NEWS Seth Rogens 10 best films By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Sat Jun 15 2013 100 PM So we should probably talk about the language. To call ""This Is the End"" profane is to call water wet. The word does not just describe the thing. It defines it. If that bothers you forget it. Dont see the movie because it will offend you no end. But if it doesnt jump right in. Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg in their directorial debut have made an audacious comedy that takes its title seriously. End times final days all that. Its apocalyptically dirty. And its hilarious. The set-up is pretty simple. Jay Baruchel flies to LA to visit his pal Rogen. (All the actors play themselves. Or at least one hopes alternate versions of themselves.) The two were pals back in the day in Canada and Baruchel doesnt care for the LA lifestyle his friend has adopted. But a boatload of marijuana serves as a welcoming gift and Rogen eventually talks Baruchel into going over to James Francos housewarming party later that night. Its a meta-version of a young Hollywood party one of many many instances in which Rogen and Goldberg (who also wrote the script) thumb their noses at celebrity culture. I wont ruin the surprises or the jokes but lets say for instance that Michael Cera at least in the movie is not the upstanding young fellow you think him to be. Like at all. Man. Whew. OK you get the idea. Baruchel and Rogen hungry after a long day of smoking dope zip out to a convenience store for something to eat. And while they are there the ground shakes as if from an earthquake. Some people are beamed up into the heavens by a bright light. And then there are Baruchel and Rogen standing there watching and freaking out. They make their way back to Francos house which he proclaims a fortress. But it is clear that no earthly fortress is strong enough to withstand forever whatever it is thats going down outside. Soon Franco Rogen Baruchel Jonah Hill and Craig Robinson are holed up sorting out rations and trying to figure out what to do. Its like a Judd Apatow slumber party. Theyre joined by Danny McBride eventually (he wasnt invited to the party) as well as a few other celebrities who show up for cameos. At this point the film could have turned into a satire of a horror movie and to some extent it actually does. But there is more. Its also a satire of Hollywood of celebrity culture of tabloid reputations. Theyre making fun of themselves and their kind and its really fun to watch. The stage is set early on when someone says they will be fine because who do they rescue first? Actors. Because they make people feel better. Franco is self-absorbed Rogen maybe a little too comfortable in the LA scene Baruchel cranky and perhaps jealous Hill a fraud living off his Oscar nomination in ""Moneyball"" Robinson an outsider. McBride is just nuts. It takes some guts to make fun of your image to be famous enough that people have formed opinions about you and then to push that reputation to absurd off-putting extremes. But everyone here plays along seemingly without hesitation. And everyone here is really really funny. Funny enough in fact that you can enjoy ""This Is the End"" without all the Hollywood funhouse mirror elements. If youre of a spiritual bent even that is covered and not in a wink-and-a-nod kind of way. (An unusual way yes. But nothing too insulting. Of course by then youll probably long since have been insulted by something else anyway.) The survivors must ask themselves in the end whether being a selfish hedonist is enough to get you into Heaven. Or maybe if it isnt whether its worth it to be a selfish hedonist anyway. You know how sometimes they say ""This movie isnt for everybody?"" Well in this case thats really true. But for those with an ear for it ""The Is the End"" is a different take on the R-rated comedy a raunchy laugh riot that actually gives you a little to think about.

"This Is the End review Grin and reap it | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThis Is the End review Grin and reap itApocalyptic comedy This Is the End may have spectators deciding whether to laugh out loud or avert their horrified gaze.Seth Rogen left and Jay Baruchel in This Is the End.  (Suzanne Hanover / SMPSP/COLUMBIA PICTURES)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticTues. June 11 2013This Is the EndStarring Seth Rogen Jay Baruchel James Franco Jonah Hill Craig Robinson and Danny McBride. Written and directed by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. At GTA theatres. 106 minutesYou are guaranteed to react to This Is the End but you may have trouble at times deciding whether to laugh out loud or to avert your horrified gaze.Either way it will get you -- sort of like the two-sided axe that Harry Potters Emma Watson brandishes as one of many celebrity guests who joins in on the fun and mayhem.Article Continued BelowYou can view the film as gross-out comedy where regulars of the Judd Apatow laugh factory -- mainly Seth Rogen Jay Baruchel James Franco Jonah Hill Craig Robinson and Danny McBride -- act like the penis-obsessed frat boys they often play this time using their real identities.Or you can see it as a horror movie since it spares no gore in presenting a biblical end-of-days scenario wherein L.A. gets fire and brimstone not intended for a standard Hollywood script.This Is the End is the directing debut of Rogen and his friend and frequent co-writer Evan Goldberg. It expands on the idea of their 2007 short Jay and Seth Versus the Apocalypse wherein Rogen and Baruchel played stoner shut-ins trying to cope with disaster outside their walls.Theyre the oblivious preparing to face oblivion in other words. For the feature the cast is expanded and the story is shifted to the modernist mansion of Franco who is having the kind of blowout party that everybody assumes guys like him have nightly in Hollywood.The gangs all here -- including Michael Cera and Christopher Mintz-Plasse two other Apatow acolytes -- and one of these comedy bros isnt happy.Thats Baruchel who came from Canada to visit his fellow Canuck pal Rogen but who isnt amused when their ganja-fuelled gaming marathon is interrupted by Rogens desire to hang with other celebrity homeboys. Baruchel has a vague beef with Hill and hes also not much of a partier. Not like Cera another Canadian who amusingly gets into the coke and the cuties in ways that should help chase away his goody two-shoes image.The hijinks are suddenly interrupted when a disaster resembling a combination alien invasion earthquake and forest fire erupts onto the Hollywood hedonists taking a fearsome body toll and also stranding fractious friends inside Francos fortress.Figuring out where they all stand with the apocalypse and with each other is part of both the fun and the frights. Certain character traits have been exaggerated while others have been altered for example McBride gets wilder and Hill gets weirder.As the lads get serious about their situation they also get funnier acting out their neuroses but also performing an impromptu sequel to Pineapple Express the stoner comedy that several of them co-starred in.The Bibles fearsome Book of Revelations gets a surprisingly straight-up reading especially when a certain horned (and horny) figure shows up for an impromptu replay of Rosemarys Baby (or the more recent Post Tenebras Lux for you artier types).Comedy/horror hybrids are a dime a dozen and This Is the End doesnt exactly reinvent the wail. But it goes to extremes not often seen especially with actors playing with their public personas and CGI providing a convincingly terrifying disaster scenario.This Is the End actually reminds me of the kind of hijinks that Abbott and Costello used to get up to decades ago when they paired their buddy comedy with the monsters of Universal Studios.In 1948s Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein for instance they shared quips and shivers not only with the title beast but also Lon Chaneys Wolf Man and Bela Lugosis Dracula.Whos on first? No for Rogen and company it should be ""Whos on fire?""And the answer is Apocalyptic comicsBring on the Grin ReaperThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"This is the End | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; this-is-the-end ) This is the End (United States 2013) June 11 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli By the time September arrives This is the End will probably be in the running for ""funniest comedy of the 2013 summer."" The end-of-the-world comedy packs more humor into its 107 minutes than many other contenders (Hangover III and The Internship for example) manage in roughly equal time allotments. When This is the End provokes laughter its frequently hysterical. Admittedly between some of the explosions of hilarity there are periods when the movie coasts on its by-the-numbers disaster scenario. Overall however its funnier and more energetic than a lot of whats out there in a movie season most would qualify as disappointing. The majority of the film takes place inside James Francos new Hollywood mansion. Hes hosting a house-warming party and about a hundred of his best friends have shown up including Seth Rogen Jay Baruchel Jonah Hill Craig Robinson and Danny McBride. There are others as well but none will be along for long (they include Michael Cera Emma Watson Rihanna and David Krumholtz) because right in the middle of the party the Rapture arrives. No fear however. Kirk Cameron is nowhere to be found (unless hes hiding behind a bush) and were not about to shift into Left Behind territory. No one in Francos house recognizes anything is amiss because - surprise surprise - none of them are spirited away to Heaven. But when earthquakes follow and demons are released from The Pit thats when things get dicey. The survivors hole up in Francos house and try to figure out how best to prepare for Judgment Day while doing things like divvying up food determining how to best use (and abuse) the lone porn magazine yelling at each other and making an unofficial sequel to Pineapple Express. While the six principles ruthlessly lampoon themselves by incorporating unflattering (to say the least) elements of their public images into their characters the standouts of This is the End are a couple of minor players neither of whom has more than about five minutes (total) of screen time. Those are Michael Cera who plays an ass-grabbing coke sniffing jerk whose contributions include a surprising bathroom scene and an ignominious end and Emma Watson who breaks the Hermione mold by spewing profanity at an amazing rate while wielding an ax. Watsons inclusion also results in one of the movies best lines (which is used in the promotional material) ""Hermione just stole all of our shit"" This is the End provides Rogen and Franco in particular an opportunity to riff off aspects of their personalities that have become tabloid fodder. Rogen is rarely shown without a joint in hand and theres a scene in which drugs fuel a ""Gangnam Style"" haze. Franco exaggerates the weird aloofness often attributed to him. Danny McBride embraces the dark side and goes into a really twisted place when he pulls out The Gimp. This is the End features a string of great and near-great moments with inspired instances that tumble into the unexpected. Theres plenty of laugh-out-loud material even if some of the connective tissue is a little lazy. The high quality of the production design enhances the effectiveness of This is the End. Normally in disaster comedies the sequences of destruction are brief and cheesy (to be fair there arent many comparisons unless you count unintentional parodies like Independence Day). Here however theyre surprisingly competent. The demons which bear a passing resemblance to the Balrog in The Fellowship of the Ring are somewhere between Grade A and Grade B CGI. Theres no evidence that the high quality of the disaster images detract from the films comedic focus. My sense is that This is the End may have started as a lark before growing into something bigger and more ambitious. Its an unorthodox motion picture that does what it promises in the trailers and promotional material. For those in search of 2013s answer to The Hangover (something not provided by the second sequel) This is the End may be it. The perverse brainchild of Rogen and Evan Goldberg offers something too many summer films are failing at an entertaining experience that exercises the funny bone while not completely deadening the synapses.

Apocalypse wow. Thats the gag for ""This Is the End"" and -- for whatever weird zeitgeisty reason -- its the joke du jour. The Julia Stiles comedy ""Its a Disaster"" already trod the same albeit non-celeb territory in April. ""Rapture-Palooza"" -- which also stars Robinson -- just opened last week. The advantage that ""This Is the End"" has is its shameless exploitation of its actors images. And I mean that in a good way. Everyone uses their real names and plays a tabloid version of themselves. So Rogen is a stoner and showbizzy climber; Hill is a slightly annoying hanger-on. Franco is a full-of-himself movie star; Baruchel -- by virtue of not having a readily defined persona -- is a nice schnook. And hilariously a few good-sport celebrities turn their images inside out. Nice girl Emma Watson shows up with an attitude -- and an axe. The perpetually neutered Michael Cera plays a cokeheaded sex addict. (There are surprise guests too -- but I wont spoil those.) The movie is directed by Rogen and frequent collaborator Evan Goldberg and has a gleeful sloppiness that seems to owe more to multiple rounds than multiple drafts. The best jokes feel like improvised riffs -- Danny McBride so at ease at playing obnoxious idiots gets the biggest laughs as he happily punctures his friends pretensions one by one. Hill and Baruchel get off some surprising out-of-left-field jokes. But the longest scenes are taken up with one of the actors -- usually Rogen or Robinson -- simply screaming and running away from something scary. Its as if the script simply said ""Seth and Craig do something funny here."" They dont always. And -- typically of these movies -- way too much of the humor depends on penises accusations of homosexuality and some sort of bodily fluid ending up somewhere it shouldnt. The most truly painful topics -- Rogens Barbra Streisand movie Francos Oscar-flop -- are carefully avoided. But I still laughed -- or at least I laughed more than I did at ""The Hangover Part III"" (although not quite as much as I did at ""After Earth""). I was impressed by the courage of one particular late-in-the-film celebrity cameo. I liked the knowingness of it all. And -- give the movie credit -- it actually makes a point of showing two totally wrecked characters taking a cab to their next party instead of trying to drive. In a film like this that practically qualifies as a public service announcement (and one I wish Lindsay Lohan who also gets namechecked sees some day.) Of course if the raunchy humor of previous Rogen-and-Goldbergs ""Superbad"" and ""Pineapple Express"" escaped you this movie is probably best passed by. But if like dude you are already saying Im-so-there -- this is one movie you definitely want to see late on a Saturday night and with a lot of friends. Just be careful about who you invite back to your house afterwards for drinks -- just in case. Ratings note The film contains full-frontal nudity strong language gory violence sexual situations and drug and alcohol abuse. This Is the End (R) Columbia (107 min.) Directed by Evan Goldberg Seth Rogen. With Rogen Jay Baruchel James Franco Jonah Hill.

"This Is the End movie review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies This is the End is rude crude -- and funny  1/2 Video This Is The End is crude funny; but not for everyone Chicago Tribune movie critic Michael Phillips and RedEye movie critic Matt Pais discuss their different takes on Seth Rogen and Evan Goldbergs This Is The End. (Posted on June 13 2013) Chicago Tribune movie critic Michael Phillips and RedEye movie critic Matt Pais discuss their different takes on Seth Rogen and Evan Goldbergs This Is The End. (Posted on June 13 2013) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune The ""Hangover"" movies even the third one no one defends barely qualify as comedies in the traditional sense. Theyre more like grimy action pictures with a joke or two tossed in to avoid the charge of false labeling. Their ugliness of spirit compounds a disinterest in verbal jokes and a reliance on brutality (which isnt the same as artfully violent slapstick) and nobody involved seems to care about making the talk snappy or keeping a scene moving forward. Whatever. Theyre hits. The public hath spoken even as the public groweth weary.""The Is the End"" is a different story -- outrageous-plus but often hilarious. I could pre-write some of the protest emails Ill be getting and save some of us some trouble. But that wouldnt be a free and fair exchange of opinions. Co-writers and co-directors Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen have acknowledged their surprise in getting away with an R instead of an NC-17 given the movies most out-there and in-there sexual sight gags along with some excessively gory details (Michael Cera impaled by a street light but coming up with a zinger regardless). ""Ludicrous"" Goldberg told the Los Angeles Times regarding the Motion Picture Association of Americas oh-whatever decision to give it an R without cuts. Rogen added ""Insanely (we) didnt have a ratings issue.""But you know? The thing really moves. Even the grottiest bits have a way of hitting their marks and darting onward the way they did in ""Borat."" This apocalyptic lark an extended bull session among various highly competitive comedians trying to be nice to each other under extreme pressure barely holds together as a movie. The central joke -- Rogen Jonah Hill Craig Robinson et al. playing pretend versions of themselves the way Bill Murray did in ""Zombieland"" -- is nothing new. Yet the best of the foul-mouthed byplay sounds improvised on the spot. At one point James Franco gets into it with Danny McBride also playing himself in an escalating dispute regarding the loutish ""Your Highness"" stars selfish mishandling of a porno magazine and the taunts are so relentless and stupid youre initially astonished at how long the scenes allowed to play out. Then it keeps going and the cutaways and the pacing actually make the effrontery funnier. I predict walkouts across America during ""This Is the End"" along with a healthy number of satisfied vaguely guilty-feeling customers who go along for the ride. It helps to have sweet-natured Jay Baruchel at the center. Hes our adenoidal stoner 21st century edition of Don Knotts and his golden-arches eyebrows suspended in permanent alarm are the perfect accessories for an End-of-Days first responder. Like everybody else in ""This Is the End"" he plays a version of himself. Rogen has invited his old pal and fellow Canadian down to LA; he and Baruchel waste a few hours getting high and gaming and then Rogen gives the insecure paranoid Baruchel the bad news. Theyve been invited to Francos party where lots of fellow comic actors and comedians will be in attendance including Hill whom Baruchel is convinced detests him. No less than Judd Apatows ""Funny People"" ""This Is the End"" speaks a lot of truth about the way comics joke around or dont in each others company even before people start dying.Bailing on Francos party (where Cera that nice kid from ""Juno"" turns out to be a gross-out skeeze on the order of Neil Patrick Harris portrayal of Neil Patrick Harris in the ""Harold amp; Kumar"" comedies) Baruchel and Rogen run down the street for some snacks and suddenly biblical-scale destruction and mayhem surround them Fellow citizens get sucked up into the sky the Hollywood Hills are in flames and a massive sinkhole leading to a fiery pit of lava appears on Francos lawn gobbling up party guests with impunity. For a good while ""This Is the End"" spins a variation on ""Panic Room"" with Franco hunkering down with Rogen Baruchel Robinson and Hill inside Francos modernist fortress. (""Designed it myself"" brags the actor/writer/director/Renaissance dude.) They squabble about the rations meet up with the occasional intruder. Emma Watson as herself drops in and then takes off because she doesnt like the ""rapey vibe"" of the situation. (If I never hear another rape joke especially in the context of a male-centric ensemble comedy Ill be fine.)This is the sort of comedy wherein someone yells ""Someone throw me a knife"" and even if you know where the gag is going it arrives a half-second sooner than expected. The audience-identification figure is Baruchel who (like the film itself) greets the End of Days developments with a reasonable amount of deadpan seriousness. The movies an expansion of a nine-minute short film Rogen and Goldberg made six years ago called ""Seth and Jay Versus the Apocalypse."" Unlike so many Hollywood comedies this one isnt squashed by the size of its budget or its digital effects. Its a one-joke movie full of smug blase comic figures poking fun at their own limited resources of courage and grace under pressure. But sometimes one joke is enough. mjphillipstribune.com This Is the End -- 3 1/2 starsMPAA rating R (for crude and sexual content throughout brief graphic nudity pervasive language drug use and some violence)Running time 147Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Entertainment Seth Rogen Movies Jay Baruchel James Franco This Is the End Jonah Hill This Is the End premiere Rogens laughter fills the air and thats not all This Is the End filmmakers We expected NC-17 not R rating Five movies to watch from Cannes Film Festival Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising77deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0610-this-is-the-end-20130611,0,1850936.column",200,thisistheend34,thisistheend,chicagotribune

The mood is exactly like what it was like at Sony when the grosses for ""After Earth"" came in. But as one survivor notes there are some bright spots to mass destruction ""If Michael Ceras dead its not a total loss huh?"" There are many hilarious ideas in the first movie directed (as well as written) by ""Superbad"" buddies Seth Rogen (who stars) and Evan Goldberg but there are also dead spots and the structure is weak Once you settle in with Rogen James Franco Jonah Hill Jay Baruchel Craig Robinson and Danny McBride -- all playing themselves as partiers at Francos house when apocalypse arrives -- it starts to sink in that theyre going to spend most of the movie in that house squabbling. ""This Is the End"" is so uneven that it amounts to maybe the most expensive home movie ever made; its destined to be watched by viewers with one thumb on the fast-forward button of the remote. James Franco (from left) Danny McBride Craig Robinson Jay Baruchel and Seth Rogen in ""This Is the End"" ( ) The stars play massively self-centered and clueless iterations of themselves as a satire on celebrity vapidity but this aspect seems a bit forced (like when the fat girl at the comedy club immediately starts with the fat-girl jokes). Baruchel meets Rogen at the airport and the two head over to Francos museum-size Hollywood Hills house for a crazy night that turns into a 70s disaster movie. Only a lot weirder. Beloved actors (and also Cera) get killed in the most gruesome imaginable ways played for shock laughter but the vividness of the effects detracts a bit from the humor and some gags get repetitive. When someone says ""You can hold onto my full weight right?"" Cue the guy getting dropped into the flaming maw of hell. When a man sticks his head in a window the decapitation is as predictable as the (many) dude-on-dude rape jokes. RELATED WHY THE GANG OF TOP COMICS DECIDED TO RIFF ON THEIR PUBLIC PERSONAS Great as it often is the movie falls short of being a classic. Rogen and Goldbergs problems also evident in their script for ""Pineapple Express"" are pacing plotting pruning That movie while funny went on way too long and confused itself with an action flick. Though this one is shorter it still seems dragged-out because we spend so much time stuck in one place. Trimming 10 or 15 minutes would have been easy. The randomly thrown-in fake trailer for ""Pineapple Express 2""? Belongs in the DVD extras department. And whats Emma Watson doing here? To my surprise though after an hour and a quarter in which the movie seems determined not to say anything (another reason it seems long) it comes up with a more conventionally satisfying third act with a safe Hollywood message (be excellent to each other). The closing 20 minutes are not only hilarious but also propel the story forward at the same time. If Rogen and Goldberg want a hit as big as ""Ghostbusters"" (another film along with ""The Exorcist"" and ""Rosemarys Baby"" that this one borrows from) they should remember that the Bill Murray comedy didnt keep putting the plot on hold for long stretches of improv. Still there is stuff in ""This Is the End"" that had me laughing so hard I sensed new body parts joining in to help out -- my pancreas was heaving my bile ducts ripped. The scene in which McBride and Franco discuss the etiquette of what gentlemen should do in the act of self-love might be the funniest thing Ive seen in a theater all year. Hill (who prays to God ""Please kill Jay. Thatd be so tight."") has a nighttime encounter with Satan thats so twisted it could have been on ""South Park."" ""Something not that chill happened last night"" he explains the next day in a rueful understatement. Once I made the mistake of trying to watch 15 Bugs Bunny cartoons in a row. Each of them was brilliant but it was too much of the same thing. I had much the same feeling at ""This Is the End"" but I want to see (most of it) again. McBride is so great that Im almost prepared to forgive ""Your Highness."" ""I cant believe we didnt make Your Highness 2 "" McBride says sitting around with the boys. Um I think Id prefer apocalypse.

Cast them as caricatures of themselves. Whip up a screenplay about Armageddon focusing it on the antics of said goofballs. Then explore what happens when these self-involved Stooges get Left Behind -- and oh how they deserve it -- in the City of Angels.Sounds like a recipe for another major comic disaster right?Surprise surprise. The cameo-laden extremely profane ""This Is the End"" is one of the brassiest crackpot comedies in years. Seriously I havent laughed with such reckless disregard for the poor sop seated next to me since last years ""21 Jump Street.""So take a bow Seth Rogen. Youre one of the big reasons this innovative often offensive comedic showpiece works. James Franco from left Jonah Hill Craig Robinson Seth Rogen Jay Baruchel and Danny McBride star in Columbia Pictures ""This is the End."" (Sony Pictures) After co-writing the DOA dud ""The Watch"" which similarly melded sci-fi with comedy but just came out stupid Rogen gets his comic groove back. The ""Pineapple Express"" actor and writer should share the high-fives with his equally deserving buddies. The main funny men in the cast -- Jay Baruchel James Franco Jonah Hill Craig Robinson Danny McBride -- make the animated zaniness look effortless. The six play a group of friends who hole up in Francos super-sized L.A.-area house after a party there gets interrupted by the apocalypse. From the cataclysmic events outside Francos abode -- in which celebs get sucked into the very hole of Hell -- to one of the raunchiest sendups of ""The Exorcist"" ever seen the writing and directing team of Rogen and Evan Goldberg fire off one outrageous off-the-rails bit after another.Advertisement In fact Rogens greatest assist comes from Goldberg his frequent collaborator who shares writing and first-time directing honors here. The duo also wrote the marvelous ""Superbad"" the demented ""Pineapple Express"" (that 2008 hit gets referenced often) and the just plain bad ""The Green Hornet.""With ""End"" they hit us with their best snickering shots. The six major actors have so much fun playing around with their assumed Hollywood personas its contagious. In fact if only Franco had been this off-the-cuff funny hosting the Oscars. Whether hes showing off his over-the-top art purchases or talking about movie keepsakes including the video camera from ""127 Hours"" -- which figures into the action -- hes having a grand time. Hill puts his nice-guy reputation through the ringer and even plays off his ""Moneyball"" Oscar nomination. The talented Robinson and Baruchel produce huge laughs with impeccable comic timing and facial expressions and McBride makes mincemeat out of the showiest role playing a troublemaker who shows up late in the film and upsets the balance of things in Francos home. Rogen even pokes fun at himself particularly his laugh and career.The cameos serve to complement and extend the laugh track further. Emma Watson (Hermione of ""Harry Potter"" fame) literally comes out swinging and packs one big potty mouth. Michael Cera (""Arrested Development"") offers up one of his cheekiest performances yet. Even one of todays hottest actors eventually shows up though it would be a crime to reveal who when and where.And thats part of the inspired genius of ""This Is the End."" You never know exactly what lunacy lurks around the corner or just how far Rogen and Goldberg will push the R rating.Sure some gags fare better than others and much of what happens ventures into the gratuitous -- including the absurd gore. But once you witness the audacity of the dance-inspiring musical number thats tossed into this clever ""Left Behind"" stew you know youre in the hands of filmmakers who know how to entertain the living hell out of us.

(Elsa Guillet-Chapuis) A This Is The End Genre Comedy; Starring Jay Baruchel James Franco Jonah Hill Danny McBride Seth Rogen; Director Evan Goldberg Seth Rogen; Release Date Wide 06/12/2013; Runtime (in minutes) 106; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Sony Pictures Entertainment Posted June 19 2013 -- 1200 AM EDT You could sit through a years worth of Hollywood comedies and still not see anything thats genuinely knock-your-socks-off audacious. But This Is the End (opening June 12) truly is. Its the wildest screen comedy in a long time and also the smartest the most fearlessly inspired and the snort-out-loud funniest. The movie opens with Seth Rogen at an airport where a passerby says ""Hey Seth Rogen what up man?"" So you immediately know that hes going to be playing a version of himself. In fact everyone in the film is playing a version of him-or herself. Rogen picks up his buddy Jay Baruchel (whos less of a star than anyone here -- a running gag) and after getting stoned they head to a party at James Francos house. Everyone from Jonah Hill to Emma Watson is there and what transpires looks so much like what youd expect a party with hip young actors and comedians to look like that its as if wed wandered into the ultimate episode of Entourage. The jockeying of movie-star egos the drugs and sex (Michael Cera is the groups libertine nerd) Rogen and Franco brainstorming a sequel to Pineapple Express -- its all cheekily plausible. Then Rogen and Baruchel venture out to a convenience store to feed their munchies and they hear a crack and blue light pours down from the heavens. Its not just an earthquake -- its the Rapture. The world is coming to an end The two hustle back to the party where most of the guests flee (or try to) and before long there are only five of them left in that house Rogen Baruchel Franco Hill and Craig Robinson. For a moment I feared that This Is the End might be a stunt that wears out its welcome in 10 minutes. But Rogen who co-wrote and codirected the film with Evan Goldberg does something incredibly sly. The movie doesnt play the end of days for laughs. Its an honest-to-God metaphysical disaster movie a fusion of Earthquake 2012 Night of the Living Dead and The Exorcist. With the apocalypse played straight the comedy can take off from it in a way thats all the more explosive as it was in the fantastic Shaun of the Dead. Sinkholes are sucking people into infernos but inside Francos house the movie-star self-absorption gets raised to an insane new pitch of competitive backbiting. The interplay is so fast and obscene that you feel like youre eavesdropping on the sorts of things comedians say to each other when theyre off camera. Then Danny McBride shows up tossing insults like cherry bombs and the hilarity just grows more scandalous. This Is the End pushes the envelope -- a severed head becomes a soccer ball and Franco and McBride turn a fight about masturbation into a confessional laugh riot. Yet through it all the movie is wonderfully deadpan about the ""reality"" its showing us. Is Jonah Hill really a narcissist who wears his nice-guy facade like the diamond stud in his ear? Is Rogen really a guilty sellout? This Is the End has great fun tweaking their public images even as its truly asking Do people like this deserve to go to heaven or hell? The answer will crack you up and lift you up high.

TWITTER James Franco Jonah Hill Seth Rogen and their friends play themselves in the apocalyptic horror comedy. The seemingly exhausted gross-out comedy genre gets a strange temporary reprieve with This Is the End an unlikable but weirdly compelling apocalyptic fantasy in which a bunch of young stars and stars-by-affiliation jokingly imagine their own mortality. A sort-of The Day of the Locust centered on successful comic actors rather than down-and-outers facing a conflagration in Los Angeles this is a dark farce thats simultaneously self-deprecating self-serving an occasion to vent about both friends and rivals and to fret about self-worth in a cocooned environment. With everyone here officially playing themselves the result is like a giant home movie and a reality horror show different enough from anything thats come before to score with young audiences. With the Hangover series outliving its welcome Judd Apatow moving on to quasi-serious stuff and Johnny-come-latelies like 21 amp; Over and Movie 43 falling short outrageous comedies arent what they used to be a few years back. Early on in This Is the End James Franco and Seth Rogen explore story ideas for a possible Pineapple Express sequel but its hard to know five years on what the public appetite would be even for that. PHOTOS 26 of Summers Most Anticipated Movies Man of Steel Wolverine The Lone Ranger Instead Rogen and co-writer/co-director Evan Goldberg reached back to 2007 for inspiration to a nine-minute short they and Jason Stone made called Seth and Jay Versus the Apocalypse. It is said to have cost 3000 and starred five of the six main actors from the present feature -- Rogen Jay Baruchel Franco Jonah Hill and Danny McBride. The full short was never shown publicly only the 85-second trailer which looks very low-rent indeed. The central conceit is that this is film about showbizs young and privileged thats supposedly being honest about their sense of entitlement their access to constant sex drugs and money neuroses and special bonds both professional and personal. This isnt Franco and Rogen and Michael Cera and everyone else playing characters getting completed trashed on coke and weed this is movie in which audiences can get off seeing actual movie stars behaving like stupid rich frat boys. At least thats the sense of special access This Is the End is purporting to afford the eager viewer. The occasion is a housewarming party at Francos dazzling new house (""Designed it myself"" the famously multitasking actor-writer-director-grad student modestly points out). In the films geographically eccentric scheme of things (it was shot on a set in Louisiana) the modernist mansion is just down the way from the Hollywood sign and yet within easy walking distance of convenience stores. The first 15 minutes are crammed with pretty funny party banter star sightings -- Emma Watson Rihanna Mindy Kaling Cera getting serviced by two babes at the same time -- and the overweening discomfort of Baruchel whos come down from Canada to visit his best bud Rogen and outdoes Woody Allen in his expressions of distaste for L.A. and the people who live there especially the hated Hill with whom hes now obliged to hang. PHOTOS 19 Movies for the End of the World But in a startling manner as if co-devised by Nathaniel West and Irwin Allen a Biblical-scaled disaster strikes in the form of explosions rumblings the ground opening up fires raging cars crashing and shafts of light beaming down from the heavens. Los Angeles is burning and many guests are swallowed up by a lava-filled sink-hole while others flee into the acrid night. In the end those left in the seeming sanctuary of Francos crib are Rogen Baruchel Hill Craig Robinson and Franco who arms himself with a World War I-vintage pistol left over from Flyboys. The cuddly sleeping arrangements assumed by the terrified man-boys cues plenty of predictable innuendo and the morning brings a set of surprises beginning with the presence of McBride who wasnt even invited to the party. Soon Watson barges in from the outside world which she reports has been invaded by zombies but she quickly decides to take her chances there rather than remain in the house once she overhears the guys discussing ""the rapey vibe"" the six men/one woman situation has introduced. Hunkering down into survivalist mode the guys keep joking around but also get serious McBrides the abrasive misfit inviting expulsion from the house by selfishly flouting rations restrictions while Baruchel goes seriously scriptural devotedly reading the Book of Revelation and announcing that ""I think its the apocalypse."" VIDEO Seth Rogens Star-Studded This Is the End Red-Band Trailer Debuts Taking this one step further Hill becomes a red-eyed demon requiring exorcism an interlude that becomes its own little movie prior to a monster-and-effects-dominated climax in which a bunch of nice Jewish boys dwell in an iconographically heavily Christian way on whether or not they are worthy of redemption after the conspicuously secular hedonistic but still guilt-ridden way theyve lived their lives. So This Is the End goes places you dont expect it to exploring the guys rifts and doubts and misgivings just as it wallows in an extravagant lifestyle that inevitably attracts public fascination. It also expresses the anxiety and insecurity of comics conscious of the big issues in life they are expected either to avoid or make fun of in their work. Rogen and Goldberg take the latter approach here in an immature but sometimes surprisingly upfront way one can interpret seriously. Or not.

Its a hilariously raunchy look at a house full of contemporary comedy superstars who are thoroughly unequipped to cope when the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse come a-knocking. Horror-comedy can be a tricky mix to pull off -- we wont take the terrifying situation seriously if its played too much for laughs and we wont be amused if things get too scary -- but Rogen and Goldberg (making their directorial debuts) get the balance just right with one gut-busting punchline and situation after another set against the escalating dread of the end of existence taking place just outside of James Francos house. Also read Man of Steel Review This Grimmer Superman"" Might Not Soar but It Flies The actors are all playing a version of themselves -- with Louisiana playing a version of the Hollywood hills -- and things get rolling when Jay Baruchel flies into town to stay with his old pal Rogen. In the movies universe Baruchel is one of Rogens old Canadian buddies and hes never quite jelled with his friends new Hollywood posse namely Franco Jonah Hill and Craig Robinson. Its that quintet however who manage to survive Francos party after the hills catch fire random citizens get pulled into the sky by a blue light and a giant sinkhole forms in the front yard. (The stars who get killed off early in the film -- this might count as a spoiler but hey its in the trailer -- include Jason Segel Mindy Kaling Rihanna Christopher Mintz-Plasse David Krumholtz Kevin Hart Martin Starr Aziz Ansari and Michael Cera the latter playing himself as a creepy coked-up sex fiend.) Also read Man of Steel Reviews Is This the Best Superman Movie Ever? Their meager food supply is mostly depleted the following morning by Danny McBride who awakes from a hangover unaware of the cataclysm and consumes nearly all of it for breakfast. As the ordeal continues personality clashes surface -- Franco hates McBride Baruchel is keeping secrets from Rogen Hill stops being particularly nice -- and these pampered man-boys have to figure out how to persevere once they run out of water (and pot). Rogen and Goldberg treat the end of the world with the respect that its due pushing their story to the limit and even daring to explore the deeper issues involved in the End of Days in a way that say religious-minded movies like ""Left Behind"" or ""The Omega Code"" havent tackled nearly as interestingly. None of the actors let their on-screen surrogates off the hook either; theyre all portrayed as venal and selfish pre-apocalypse bringing those traits even more to the forefront when theyre all desperately fighting for survival. (Theres also a lot of mockery of their own careers with ""Your Highness"" and ""The Green Hornet"" among others becoming targets for jokes.) The films humor trades very much in the R-rated raunch that fans of these writers and these performers have come to expect with large dollops of the post-panic jokes about man-on-man sex and male nudity that have become the trademarks of the Judd Apatow bromantic comedies. If the prospect of this ensemble thrills you youll get what you want out of ""This Is the End"" but if you didnt like them before this it probably wont change your mind. The films one flaw feels Apatovian as well -- its got an extra 10-15 minutes that could easily have been trimmed -- but even though the film sags a bit it never grinds to a halt. Perhaps the biggest gambit that ""This Is the End"" has up its sleeve is to sneak a message about morality and generosity into a show-biz satire-cum-disaster movie. Thanks to their audacity Rogen and Goldberg bring us the end of the world with a bang not a whimper. Video by Sydney Papenhausen Breaking News To Your Inbox.

The apocalypse generally seen as an occasion for sober reflection and perhaps deep despair instead provides an excuse for ostensibly grown men to drink their own urine kick around a guys severed head and have long drawn-out arguments about their autoerotic habits in ""This Is the End."" A sloppy sophomoric sometimes awfully funny horror-laffer hybrid that speculates as to how Seth Rogen Jay Baruchel and other members of the Judd Apatow comic fraternity would (mis)behave if forced to spend Armageddon in close quarters this directing debut for co-writers Rogen and Evan Goldberg offsets its slightly smug premise with a clever sense of self-parody and near-cataclysmic levels of vulgarity. Mid-summer competition aside commercial disaster seems unlikely.This story first appeared in the June 4 2013 issue of Variety. Subscribe today.See more. In making the decision to have well-known comedic actors play themselves regular screenwriting partners Rogen and Goldberg (elaborating on their 2007 short ""Jay and Seth Versus the Apocalypse"") clearly had fun playing up and/or working against different aspects of each stars persona. As written Seth (Rogen) is the guy everyone likes the good-natured goof who apart from shedding several pounds hasnt been changed much by his Hollywood fortunes. Jay (Baruchel) is the gangly awkward slightly neurotic one who doesnt quite fit in with Seths newer more famous friends. SEE ALSO This Is The End Red-Band Trailer Features Cursing Ax-Wielding Emma Watson These friends naturally include Seths ""Pineapple Express"" co-star James Franco whos hosting a star-studded party at his ridiculous cubist-style Hollywood Hills estate when catastrophe strikes without warning. Fiery sinkholes open up cars explode and numerous people are mysteriously beamed up into the heavens while others meet a much gorier fate down below. (Dont get too attached to Michael Cera -- or for that matter Rihanna Mindy Kaling and Christopher Mintz-Plasse.) As Los Angeles burns with no Internet or TV service to provide any insight into what the devil is going on Jay and Seth decide to take shelter at James house. There they must share their limited space water food and weed with three other survivors Jonah Hill very friendly and very creepy; boisterous life-of-the-party type Craig Robinson; and Danny McBride who gets the most interesting and presumably least accurate characterization as a borderline sociopath who has any number of unsanitary ways of making himself at home. (Special mention must be made of the brief appearances of Cera gleefully sending up a kinky coke-snorting nonexistent version of himself and Emma Watson temporarily halting the frat-house shenanigans with her ax-wielding turn.) Theres a mild air of self-satisfaction to all this inside-Hollywood spoofery and even a few self-deflating jabs (at the expense of career misfires like ""The Green Hornet"" and ""Your Highness"") cant entirely dispel it. Yet the conceit works nonetheless. The actors sense of fun is infectious (even when they panic they do so with a wink) and it feels in keeping with the movies general refusal to take anything here seriously which not only allows Rogen and Goldberg to get away with some of their more appalling setpieces but also paves the way for a surreally upbeat finale. Although doctored for the screen the characters relationships strike authentic relatable notes of male frustration and anxiety smoothly handled by actors who are clearly at ease grooving on each others comic rhythms. Simply by boasting the weirdest most diverse resume of the bunch Franco comes off as the best sport here; his characters house which serves as the pics primary backdrop is amusingly stuffed with garish modern artwork including a giant sculpted phallus straight out of ""A Clockwork Orange."" That particular sight gag is consistent with the decidedly groin-focused nature of the proceedings as when the house is suddenly invaded by a horned and visibly horny demon. These forays into outlandish supernatural territory even more than the booze the pot and the drawn-out banter sessions are what lend ""This Is the End"" its spiky comic energy even if the actual comedy feels haphazard and inconsistent much of the time. In some ways this is just a creepier slightly funnier horror-pic spoof than anything in the recently resurrected ""Scary Movie"" franchise; along with its references to ""Rosemarys Baby"" and ""The Exorcist"" the film spends a considerable amount of time elucidating prophecies in the book of Revelation often with an impressively straight face. The deliberately scrappy production was lensed by d.p. Brandon Trost on a nocturnal digital palette lit up by bursts of orange fire and smoke; cheesy-looking but serviceable f/x add to the low-rent charm. An obligatory appearance by ""Gangnam Style"" as well as a memorably bizarre contribution from the Backstreet Boys figure into the lively soundtrack.

Thankfully that blood-splattered bong-sanctioned Venn diagram has resulted in a frequently hilarious riff on the personalities of Rogen and many of his famous friends. Rogen plays ""Seth Rogen"" lifelong chum to ""Jay Baruchel"" (Jay Baruchel) and housewarming guest of ""James Franco"" (you get the idea) when the party is interrupted by nothing less than the end of the world ... or at least the Hollywood Hills. An expansion of Rogen and Goldbergs 2007 short ""Jay and Seth vs. the Apocalypse"" the strain on ""End"" to further elaborate on that high-concept small-setting premise is felt now and again as the star-studded ranks are swiftly culled to six survivors -- Rogen Baruchel Franco Jonah Hill Craig Robinson and Danny McBride -- and discussion then turns toward rations supplies one anothers careers sleeping arrangements waning friendships newfound alliances inevitable betrayals cannibalism and all-around rape vibes. World-ending urgency takes a backseat to a shaggier pace more amenable to both improv-heavy dialogue and overly juvenile digressions -- bodily fluids and Biblically proportioned genitalia make their respective appearances -- while a sequence of extended mock masturbation between celebrities threatens to serve as an entirely-too-apt metaphor for the film itself. Its all worth tolerating though for an eagerly self-effacing ensemble (a coked-out Michael Cera gets to steal his own handful of scenes) that also happens to share a credible chemistry (or in the case of Franco and McBride animosity) throughout. Furthermore Rogen and Goldberg ensure that gags like Francos obsession with collecting props from his own films actually play into the plot and their knowing incorporation of genre conventions makes for its own delights such as cinemas single most sarcastic exorcism scene. Improbably enough the fraying friendship between ostensible leads Baruchel and Rogen proves to be a sufficiently recurring emotional throughline without imposing enough blatant sappiness to slow up the gears of goofiness at work. Whenever the scope does broaden beyond the Franco household and the fragile egos holed up within Brandon Trosts lensing and Henry Jackmans score exude the same smoky sweeping grandeur of more straight-faced disaster flicks and just when the film seems to have blown its load of cameos the climax doles out some gleefully left-field reveals best unspoiled by yours truly. Lets be honest though; its not like finding out ahead of time would be the end of the world.
