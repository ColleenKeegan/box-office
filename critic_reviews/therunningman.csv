Pic based on a novel by Richard Bachman (Stephen King) opens in 2017 when the world following a financial collapse is run by a police state with TV a heavily censored propaganda tool of the government. Arnold Schwarzenegger is Ben Richards a helicopter pilot who disobeys orders to fire on unarmed people during an LA food riot. Hes slapped in prison and escapes 18 months later with pals Yaphet Kotto and Marvin J. McIntyre. Producer-host of the popular TV gameshow The Running Man Damon Killian (Richard Dawson) orders Richards up as his next contestant and he is duly captured and made a runner in this lethal (and fixed) gladiatorial contest for the masses. Format works only on a pure action level with some exciting but overly repetitious roller-coaster style sequences of runners hurtling into the game through tunnels on futuristic sleds. Bloated budget was 27 million. Schwarzenegger sadistically dispatches the baddies enunciating typical wisecrack remarks (many repeated from his previous films) but its all too easy despite the casting of such powerful presences as Jim Brown and former wrestlers Jesse Ventura and Prof. Toru Tanaka.

This is a sad stale tale of an African-American boy of great promise --- called simply Running Man --- whose life derails in crime and drugs and whose heartbroken family is left wondering what went wrong. After two Obies and a Pulitzer nom this chamber opera arrives on the regional circuit in grim beauty with a story as dark as its moody lighting and mournful music. This is a sad stale tale of an African-American boy of great promise -- called simply Running Man -- whose life derails in crime and drugs and whose heartbroken family is left wondering what went wrong. There is the whiff of sociological case study as a conjure woman called Seven shows Running Mans grieving sister Miss Look some truths of their family life a mother who pampered her son and taught him French and Latin and a father embittered by World War II who is cold and intolerant of his soft son (compounded by the implication of homosexuality in a scene in which he dons his mothers clothes and makeup). The sister who has enabled him too long finally rejects him in a cavalcade of mixed metaphors about snakes and birds living together. The upshot of the shows multiple perspectives is to show that both truth and blame are elusive although finally disturbingly the story suggests that Running Man bears no responsibility for his life that people are merely products of familial environments ""My mothers dreams/My fathers schemes/Pelted me like hail."" And the shows lack of originality is also a setback ""God made me pretty/God made me smart/God made me black."" The music played on a nearly bare stage behind the singers is bluesy and jazzy and operatic but despite this variety there is a rarefied sameness of tone and tempo just as the book is unrelieved by humor or joy. The voices are splendid uniting in a gorgeous finale ""Sail On"" and the singers expressive faces provide an emotional context (Roberta Gumbel is very beautiful and touching as Mother) despite the lack of physical movement. Running Man as a boy is silently performed by Johnny Jamison a local sixth-grader making an impressive debut.

In the fascist state that America has become Ben Richards (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a helicopter pilot with the Federal police. One night while on a routine patrol hes ordered to terminate a food riot in Bakersfield Calif. Some 1500 unarmed women and children are running amok in search of nourishment. THE year is 2019. In the fascist state that America has become Ben Richards (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a helicopter pilot with the Federal police. One night while on a routine patrol hes ordered to terminate a food riot in Bakersfield Calif. Some 1500 unarmed women and children are running amok in search of nourishment. When Ben refuses to obey someone else takes command of the craft and does the job. The state puts the blame on Ben who becomes known as the infamous butcher of Bakersfield and packs him off to prison. All this (and even more) happens during the opening credits of The Running Man which has the manners and the gadgetry of a sci-fi adventure film but is at heart an engagingly mean cruel nasty funny send-up of television. Its not quite Network but then it also doesnt take itself too seriously. The title The Running Man is the name of a hugely popular television program within the film. This is the ultimate game show by which the state-run television network keeps citizens docile and glued to their sets. Each week the Los Angeles-based presentation picks a notorious prisoner to be it in a game of hide-and-seek during which the prisoner is hunted to the death by professional stalkers. Steven E. de Souza (48 Hours) adapted the screenplay from a novel by Richard Bachman the pseudonym of Stephen King. Whatever the screenplays literary provenance the film most vividly recalls the various movie adaptation of Richard Connells story The Most Dangerous Game and Norman Jewisons ponderous sci-fi nightmare Rollerball. The Running Man which opens today at the Embassy 2 and other theaters is a good deal more fun in a ghoulish sort of way. The game itself played out in a section of Los Angeles devastated by the great quake of 97 features Mr. Schwarzenegger Maria Conchita Alonso Yaphet Kotto and Marvin J. McIntyre as they face a series of larger-than-life stalkers equipped with flame throwers electric saws and razor-edged hockey sticks. The stunts special effects and timely escapes are flashily directed by Paul Michael Glaser though fairly standard stuff. The chief contribution of Mr. Glaser (once the Starsky of Starsky and Hutch) and Mr. de Souza is their raffish backstage vision of television in 2017 which is not much different of course from 1987. It all comes together in the person of Damon Killian (Richard Dawson) the viciously cheery lady-kissing ratings-obsessed emcee of the television show. Mr. Dawson who was the host of televisions long-running Family Feud game show is wonderfully comic as a fellow whod star his own beloved dad as the running man if it would buy him a few points. His hair always perfectly blow-dried his haberdashery immaculate Mr. Dawson steals the movie as a personality composed of equal parts of Phil Donahue Merv Griffin and Maximilien Francois Marie Isidore (Mickey) Robespierre. He has a mean mouth but he smiles a lot and can think on his feet. When one of the musclemen on his staff doesnt respond fast enough to his orders he sneers Whats wrong steroids made you deaf? In the course of the show in which the butcher of Bakersfield is turning stalkers into mincemeat he hastily adds the innocent Miss Alonso to the cast of runners. Her crime She cheated on her college exams and had sexual relations with three different men in one year. Mr. Dawson is given the films best lines but Mr. Schwarzenegger goes through the movie with disarming dauntlessness. In the fight scenes there is as is usual in all Schwarzenegger vehicles a heavy emphasis placed on the vulnerability of male genitalia. One guy here is sliced up the middle by the buzz saw which doesnt easily fit with the good clean fun of the movies satire. The film tries to have it both ways not always successfully. Like many such sci-fi movies its also loaded with tantalizingly subversive reflections on the state of contemporary society. Its the supposition of The Running Man that we could advance from this era of blissful Government-approved deregulation to a police state within the professional lifetime of one Johnny Carson. You could almost say that The Running Man makes you stop and think. Next Contestant . . .

The Running Man Movie Review amp; Film Summary (1987) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-running-man-1987,200,therunningman4,therunningman,rogerebert
"The Running Man (R) The Running Man (R) By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer November 20 1987 Is it enough to stuff Arnold Schwarzenegger into a zip-up monkey suit surrounding him with light-show effects smoke and pounding music and have futuristic bruisers chase him with chainsaws stilletto hockey sticks and laser weapons? No. You want to know if ""The Running Man"" is a good-time macho show right? Stay at home and watch professional wrestling. Or ""Miami Vice"" (same director -- Paul Michael Glaser). Sure theres blood spattering and bullets riddling and Big Boys Banging Biceps. But through the dry-ice haze ""Running Man"" is surprisingly boring. The filmmakers want to create a futuristic backdrop (Los Angeles 2019) with serious sci-fi statements about TV as opiate of the masses and the evils of government propaganda. Ptui on this exposition. Schwarzenegger as ex-cop Ben Richards hardly has time to bust heads -- what with all this jabbering and all that jousting with Amber (Maria Conchita Alonso also in a monkey suit). And in those moments when hes about to splice a cranium or blow a thug sky-high and a sardonic world-weary wisecrack is called for screenwriter Steven E. de Souzas word processor wimps out. The plot sounds better than it is Ben Richards is framed for murder and goes to jail. He busts out with a buddy (Yaphet Kotto) and a coupla others. But they get caught. Meanwhile Damon Killian (Richard Dawson) hosts this TV show -- ""The Running Man"" -- where convicts get a chance at freedom if they beat a gang of psycho-killers. Ratings are low because the convicts get chopped into Hamburger Helper too easily. Damon needs better gladiators so he cuts a deal with Richards et al. They have to evade the following freaks of Hollywood nature Dynamo a Germanic human circuit board who zaps people to death; Subzero a Japanese fella with a mean slice n dice hockey stick; Buzzsaw who in one of the films more complex and quieter moments attempts to turn Schwarzenegger into Wiener schnitzel; Captain Freedom who just uses his human bulk; and the Stalker Fireball (Jim Brown) who cooks with napalm. But you know what? Theyre all pans-oids. Arnold hardly gets dirty. Theres better tussling and suspense in ""Bambi Meets Godzilla.""

"The Running Man (R) The Running Man (R) By Rita Kempley Washington Post Staff Writer November 13 1987 That titanic Teuton Arnold Schwarzenegger is back in action in ""The Running Man"" a fast-paced futuristic puree of ""Beat the Clock"" ""Max Headroom"" professional wrestling and ""The Most Dangerous Game."" Pumped and primed for self-parody the burly star proves as funny as he is ferocious in this tough guys commentary on Americas preoccupation with violence and game shows. Its set in a media-massaged totalitarian tomorrowland first envisioned in a novella by Richard Bachman (alias Stephen King). Screenwriter Steven E. de Souza of ""48 Hours"" and ""Commando"" adds familiar shtick and splatter to this kicky screen adaptation. As he did in ""Commando"" he supports Schwarzenegger with a gutsy broad and lots of macho-lingo -- rejoinders like ""He had to split"" of a villain he has halved with a chain saw. The deceased known as Buzzsaw had been stalking our hero a recalcitrant contestant on ""The Running Man"" a government-backed game show in which convicted felons run for their lives in lieu of trial. It is hosted by diabolical Damon Killian played by Richard Dawson the one-time kissing host of ""Family Feud."" He approaches this role with the same loony energy you see in screaming housewives whove just picked the right door on ""Lets Make a Deal."" He lampoons the role of game show maitre d billed as ""everybodys favorite human"" with unctuous polish. Just as Merv Griffin once picked the puzzles for ""Wheel of Fortune"" Damon handpicks the contestants with the guidance of the Justice Department. They are released then pursued and almost always caught by superstar assassins. Fabulous prizes include ""trial by jury suspended sentence or even a full pardon."" Lately the ratings have been dropping because the contestants have been wimps. Enter Schwarzenegger. Shrink-wrapped in a spandex unitard hes got more bulges than a tube sock stuffed with light bulbs. Chewing a stogie and sweating oily grit he is warrior not wimp. He plays Ben Richards a former police officer who has been framed for slaughtering 60 innocent civilians in a food riot. Recruited for the high-tech manhunt the so-called ""Butcher of Bakersfield"" is assigned ""a court-appointed theatrical agent."" He signs away all rights to residuals and spin-offs then pens the contract on the pushy agents back. The postapocalyptic setting is borrowed from ""Max Headroom"" and ""Blade Runner"" with giant billboard TVs and streetwise couch-potatoes warming themselves beside smoking oil drums. Its an unexpected look for director Paul Michael Glaser whos known for his pastel police on ""Miami Vice."" Though hes turned to techie dazzle and earth tones Glaser retains his small-screen savvy when it comes to pacing police action. Of course Schwarzenegger still sounds like he ought to be yodeling. His vowel sounds like the notes of a whiplashed bassoon are now an accepted part of his legend. His timing is improving but do we really need a bon mot for every death blow? However he does show us a new side -- the romantic galoot. And opposite spitfire Maria Conchita Alonso hes got more flex-appeal than ever before. Alonso a former Venezuelan soap star is as effervescent as Schwarzenegger is stolid and the two of them actually seem attracted to each other in a way that wont seem mushy to the testosterone cases who are Schwarzeneggers target audience. Alonso plays the hot-tempered Amber Mendez a network jingle writer who is kidnaped by Richards but later learns to love the big galoot. Their scenes are actually stronger than the mighty-man stand-offs which are filled with standard splatter. Nevertheless they feature an assortment of eccentric hulks including former running back Jim Brown as the napalm-powered Fireball; pro wrestler Toru Tanaka as Subzero a stalker armed with exploding hockey pucks; and my own personal favorite Erland Van Lidth a former U.S. wrestling team member as Dynamo who sings Wagner while electrocuting his prey. Yaphet Kotto and Dweezil Zappa become the heros lieutenants when he joins the underground resistance. ""The Running Man"" marks Schwarzeneggers first starring role as a revolutionary perhaps the first fallout from his marriage into Americas leading liberal family. Nah. The message is irrelevant. Its still the Olympian myth albeit in a Lycra leotard that counts with the Arn Man. ""The Running Man"" is rated R for profanity and violence.
