The original 2006 ""Cars"" -- though the least compelling of Pixars 11 previous features -- is a Lamborghini compared to the Edsel that is ""Cars 2."" Even worse Pixar didnt seem to learn its lesson from the first film. Which is Cars just dont anthropomorphize as well as say toys (the ""Toy Story"" trilogy) monsters (""Monsters Inc."") insects (""A Bugs Life"") fish (""Finding Nemo"") or even culinary-inclined rats (""Ratatouille""). Automobiles are clunky. Theyre metallic. They have four wheels and are low to the ground. Their faces (comprised of headlights grills and fenders) are less than expressive. Also Read Box Office Cars 2 Looks to Rev Up 60M Opening and Billions More in Toys Sales ""Cars 2"" inherits that stumbling block and then compounds it by shifting the spotlight from Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson) the shiny red race-car hero of the first film to his dim bulb sidekick Mater (Larry the Cable Guy whose mother calls him Daniel Lawrence Whitney) a rusted-out tomato red tow truck. But theres more. Pixar has opted to turn ""Cars 2"" a movie co-directed and co-written by chief creative officer John Lasseter into an international espionage thriller on wheels. Bad choice. The movie plays like a wannabe kiddie version cross between the ""Fast and Furious"" and James Bond franchises. Its not just on tires but tired. The opening sequence if it doesnt have young viewers running from the theater in terror will certainly leave them totally confused and poking parents to ask ""Whats happening?"" Its set on a deep-sea oil-drilling platform and murkily introduces Finn McMissle (Michael Caine) a British secret agent car. Under cover of night hes snooping around on the platform only to be pounced upon and nearly destroyed in a hail of gunfire by a bunch of villainous vehicles. From there we go back to Radiator Springs the small town setting of the first film to find Lighting and Mater tooling around. Their hometown sojourn ends when Lightning enters the World Prix an international race with segments in Tokyo Italy and London and he brings Mater along with him. At which point the plot kicks into high gear as Mater is mistaken in Tokyo by Finn and a fellow British agent Holly Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer) for a friendly American spy. They are hoping that Mater can help them figure out who is trying to destroy Lightning and otherwise perpetrate an evil plot to sabotage a new alternative fuel. Its all more than a little confusing and only fitfully engaging. Theres toilet humor (literally in an extended scene in a high-tech Japanese bathroom) automotive jokes and lots of spy jokes. The single best joke in Japan Mater mistakes wasabi sauce for pistachio ice cream and gulps down an extra large serving. (Then again how many small fry are going to get a wasabi joke?) ""Cars 2"" strikes me as a trainer film meant to prepare kid viewers to become future consumers of all the vroom-vroom genre crap that Hollywood is going to feed them in coming years. After all if you like gleaming fast cartoon cars as a 6-year old youre going to love shiny loud aggressive cars that turn into robots in ""Transformers 55"" when youre a 16 year old and youre going to flip for whatever James Bond is driving in the umpteenth 007 flick when youre 26 or 36 and beyond. All that said ""Cars 2"" is preceded by ""Toy Story Hawaiian Vacation"" a short that is a pure delight. In it Barbie and Kens planned tropical vacation gets canceled so Woody Buzz Lightyear and the rest of their toy buddies create a fake Hawaii for the two right in the playroom. This short has all the heart humor fun and sheer kick thats missing from ""Cars 2"" giving me hope that Pixar simply took a temporary detour off the right track with that clunking heap of metal.

One was hoping Pixars Midas touch would ameliorate the situation with the sequel to its admittedly lacklustre 2006 Hicksville lament Cars. But alas this follow-up - co-directed by head honcho John Lasseter - never really gets into gear. While wee fans of the franchise will doubtlessly revel at the sight of a fleet of new toy cars to pester mummy for the rest of us can only ponder the reasons behind a premise that mixes 60s globe-trotting spy-jinks and brash computer- game-style racing with humdrum messages about the eco virtues of alternative fuels and how important it is to respect the intelligence (or lack of intelligence) of ones peers.Much of the story revolves around a stiff-upper-lipped Aston Martin-esque super-spy called Finn McMissile (voiced by Michael Caine) who unearths a fiendish plot to destroy all petrol-driven vehicles. By sheer coincidence rickety hick pick-up Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) is taken for a fellow agent and unwittingly embroiled in the scenario. And thats pretty much it.Pixars technical expertise is not in doubt the animators elaborate vistas and extraordinary level of detail is a marvel. But creatively Cars 2 is a bit of a scene-hopping mess made worse by dint of a million car chases and hardly any gags.  The most obvious weakness is characterisation. Unlike those of say Toy Story which ooze individuality and make the audience feel emotionally connected here its just a bunch of shiny vehicles that sprout mouths and eyes from out of the blue. As a means to flog merchandise Cars 2 ticks all the boxes. But as a character-led film it doesnt work. Time perhaps for the franchise to be towed off to the scrapyard. Sorry Pixar. A Fan.

Photo Credit Disney/Pixar advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A small-town tow truck joins an international spy team. BOTTOM LINE An unexpected summer treat fun fast-moving and clever. CAST Voices of Owen Wilson Larry the Cable Guy Emily Mortimer WHEN/WHERE Area theaters some in 3-D LENGTH 147 If anyone makes sequels that actually seem worth the effort its the people at Pixar. Already theyve produced ""Toy Story 3"" one of the best films of recent years -- with or without a numeral -- and now comes the breezily enjoyable ""Cars 2."" Its an example of what a sequel should or at least can be. Returning from the 2006 animated hit ""Cars"" are the zippy red race car Lightning McQueen (voice of Owen Wilson) and his tow-truck sidekick Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) though they unexpectedly trade spotlights as they steer off the beaten track and into James Bond territory. McQueens race against Italian braggart Francesco Bernoulli (John Turturro in full ethnic fugue) is a mere backdrop to the central story in which bucktoothed Mater joins an international spy team. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Who was the Sons of Anarchy Homeless Woman? Maters mentors are Finn McMissile (Michael Caine) a sleek coupe with a debonair pencil grille and the prim but pretty Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer). The villainous Professor Z (Thomas Kretschmann) is of German design of course; Eddie Izzard voices millionaire Sir Miles Axlerod a cross between Richard Branson and a Range Rover. Its classic spy-comedy stuff with Mater as the bumbler mistaken for an undercover genius but co-directors John Lasseter and Brad Lewis fill nearly every minute with elaborate comedy (how would you torture a car anyway?) or split-second jokes (the Parisian mime-vehicle). Meantime Larry the Cable Guy brings new depth -- thats right -- to his redneck shtick while Caine and Mortimer are perfect as Brits whose chains are being Yanked. Does this mean well see a ""Cars 3""? To quote Mater ""Is the Popemobile Catholic?"" VideoTrailer Cars 2 advertisement | advertise on newsday Cars 2 director has auto motives John Lasseter directed the first all-computer-generated feature film 1995s ""Toy Story"" as well as 1998s ""A Bugs Life"" 1999s ""Toy Story 2"" and the original ""Cars"" movie in 2006. The boyish executive has changed little longtime Pixar colleagues say since taking on the key leadership role at Disney which now owns Pixar. ""He loves telling stories thats when hes happiest"" said Sharon Calahan who began working at Pixar on the first ""Toy Story"" feature film in 1994 and served as director of photography-lighting on ""Cars 2."" ""The corporate stuff hes incredibly good at but its not fun for him. Hes a big kid and his playbox is Pixar. The Cars characters in particular are his babies."" In fact automobiles are part of Lasseters origin story His father Paul who died in May at age 87 managed a Chevy parts dealership in Whittier Calif. As a teenager Lasseter worked for his dad as a stock boy and truck driver hauling auto parts around Southern California in the waning years of the muscle-car era. Today Lasseter collects classic cars -- a favorite is his black 1952 Jaguar XK 120 -- and attends auto races at the Infineon Raceway near his home.

By Peter Rainer Film critic June 24 2011 Save for later Saved Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson) is shown in a scene from Cars 2. Courtesy of Disney/Pixar          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Of all the many and mostly wonderful Pixar films the 2006 ""Cars"" with the possible exception of ""Up"" is my least favorite - although the second half of ""Wall-E"" lost me and the image in ""Ratatouille"" of all those supposedly cute rats pouring through the kitchen of a high-end French restaurant ranks right up there for me with the shower scene in ""Psycho."" ""Cars 2"" is marginally better than its predecessor but the same problem still remains Cars just arent very interesting as anthropomorphic animation vehicles (pun intended). The facial expressions are necessarily limited and so even more than with the other Pixar films the ""Cars"" series relies on voice-over characterization. If you close your eyes during ""Cars 2"" youll miss a lot of overbusy animated shenanigans but youll still get the gist of the story. This is not necessarily a good thing.Perhaps this explains why director John Lasseter who codirected with Brad Lewis from a script by Ben Queen relies too much on the countrified comedy of Larry the Cable Guys Mater a pickup truck who seems to have wandered in from a vaudeville sketch on the Grand Ole Opry. Returning again as well is Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson instantly identifiable by his drawl). Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? The helter-skelter story line has its ecofriendly side (as did ""Wall-E""). Eddie Izzards Land Rover magnate Sir Miles Axlerod promoting a clean fuel alternative to gasoline stages a Grand Prix-style auto race that pits Lightning against Italian favorite Francesco (John Turturro). Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Oil company spies and counterspies infiltrate the proceedings which often intentionally have the flavor of 1960-era ""007"" movies. Michael Caine voices a British spy called Finn McMissile an Aston Martin of course and Emily Mortimer is his accomplice Holley Shiftwell. They help tone things up especially when Larry the Cable Guy is around which is a lot of the time.The films message in the end is Be yourself. Im sure departing audiences will take this to heart as they drive into the traffic jams that likely await them. Grade B- (Rated G.)

Itas not that Cars 2 wonat get you (or really your average 9-year-old boy) from point A to point B somewhat entertainingly but by Pixaras outrageous standards of Oscar shoo-in virtuosity this sequel is a disappointment at best. Living up to Pixar fans spectacular expectations and sequelizing a toy-driven franchise thats earned over roughly a gazillion bucks in kids merch must be tough When youre taking commercial risks on a silent robot on a dead planet and a grizzled sad old man with a flying house theres some logic in taking an easy victory lap. Talking cars is an easier sell as it was with the first movie. And Cars 2 pits Lightning McQueen against the amusingly obnoxious F-1 racer Francesco (voiced by a John Turturro at his Dom DeLouise worst) in a three-city international race to promote a new type of green fuel. Undoubtedly theres some thrill to the bright cartoon postcard montages that introduce each city -- Tokyo Paris and London -- and McQueens fast sprawling races have the plastic pixel-count thrill of the Gran Turismo video games. But it soon becomes confused or at least confusing. The race is sponsored by a former oil magnate with a sketchy past giving rise to a James Bond-like subplot involving McQueens trusted rusted tow-truck pal Mater (voiced by Larry the Cable Guy in a voice that starts off galunking and just keeps on chugging out moronic clichA(c)s). Theres a reason he was a comic-relief sidekick in the first film Its like giving Jar-Jar Binks his own movie to see Mater tangle it up with a hot little coupe love interest (Emily Mortimer) and a 007-like superspy (Michael Caine who gets a bang-up introduction that is the films most elegant piece of storytelling). Still since Mater is such an annoying clunker this story line plays less like a spoof on Bond and more like a subpar episode of Chuck. Ostensibly the emotional through line is the evolving friendship between McQueen and Mater but the two are physically separated for much of the film as Mater gets lost in a miasma of clean fuels secret oil reserves secret agents and romance. Even for a film about autos this is a lot of plot machinery. Whats usually so exceptional about Pixar films -- that Miyazaki-like ability to tap into something universal and simple -- is absent. With three separate races to be run an international conspiracy to unravel and a crowded pit crew of supporting characters who each need their moment the films race-speed transitions come so fast and so suddenly that the films just grinding its gears trying to keep up. Will your kids have fun? Sure though the green-energy subplot is too intricate. As for the parents politically it feels like a focus-grouped cop-out. Lefties will be flattered by the cars environmental ideals; conservatives will cheer when it turns out that green energy doesnt work. Worry not Disney shareholders No automotive cross-branding opportunity was risked. Theres plenty of vrooom and zoooom but at two hours kids may be confused and even a little bored by Maters repetitive doofus humor and McQueens repetitive races. Maybe its been easier for Pixar to animate animals or cowboy toys or robots because we always imagined them to have their own personalities. As kids when we played with cars we raced them we crashed them we jumped them off couches -- and imagined ourselves inside them leaping off that staircase or looping around that flimsy plastic track. We wanted to drive cars not be cars. Maybe our vehicular fantasies will always remain mechanical -- empty without some humanity inside them.

Some are for youngsters though it never hurts the adults to be reminded. For instance Treat your friends well be humble and so forth. Other lessons speak to the multiplexs more jaded folk. For 25 years now animation titan Pixar has more often than not nailed the sweet spot between the two. So heres a lesson from ""Cars 2"" the follow-up to Pixar honcho John Lasseters 2006 auto-racing valentine You can take the tow truck out of Radiator Springs but its hard to take that fictional burg on Route 66 out of a battered vehicle named Mater. In this decidedly mid-octane story NASCAR-winning Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson) is nudged by his Porsche honey Sally (Bonnie Hunt) to take Mater along when he competes in the World Grand Prix. The globe-revving race is the brainchild of Miles Axlerod (Eddie Izzard) a former oil exec who has had a catalytic conversion to alternative fuel. Only someone is trying to take the air out of the race by zeroing in on the alt-fueled competitors. Stranger-in-a-strange-land mishaps ensue as Mater Lightning and the rest of the Radiator Springs pit crew visit Tokyo Paris the fictional seaside town of Porto Corsa Italy and London. (If Lightning didnt have a red paint job wed see his embarrassment.) Lasseter co-director Brad Lewis and writer Ben Queen supercharge a tale of a friendship under duress with an es pionage thriller. Only these days relying on genre (like resorting to sequels) seems to be the refuge of studios running low on fresh ideas. Animate it beautifully and no one will be the wiser they seem to think. In Tokyo Mater is mistaken for an American secret agent by two British spies. Michael Caine gives suave voice to Finn McMissile. Emily Mortimer portrays rookie Holley Shiftwell. Yes ""Cars 2"" is visually dynamic. The stunning neon spectacle of Tokyo is topped when Mater and Lightning take an aerial tour of London. (How they get airborne may be goofy but the view as they zip past St. Pauls Cathedral is truly something.) But the storytelling is strictly conventional. Theres a confab of mob types in Italy and a hinted-at romance between a mismatched pair. There is also a troubling scene of torture suited to the spy genre but a little dodgy in a G-rated flick. This ""Its just cars so its OK"" attitude makes for a conflicted message. Heres another paradox Without the accompaniment of his charming mug Wilson doesnt make a particularly likable hero. This was a plot point in the original. After all Lightning McQueen was the cocky upstart to Doc Hudson portrayed by a fella named Paul Newman. Now the beloved star and well-known racing lover has left the speedway and Lightnings plaintive whine has grown louder. On the other hand freed of his ""Blue Collar Comedy Tour"" naughtiness and slovenly get-up Larry the Cable Guy has helped make Mater one of Pixars sweetest creations. He just happens to reside in the studios least-magical franchise. Just how routine is ""Cars 2""? The animation titan provides an answer. As is its habit the studio offers a short before the feature. ""Hawaiian Vacation"" picks up where ""Toy Story 3"" left off with its box full of fabulous playthings living at little Bonnies house. Shes headed off on vacation and so are stowaways Ken and Barbie. Or so they think. ""Hawaiian Vacation"" is brief hilarious and touching which raises a question that nags once ""Cars 2"" gets underway What to do when the amuse- bouche is better than the main course? ""CARS 2.""

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jun. 24 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Thursday Jun. 23 2011 248PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Pixars 12th feature film begins as a James Bond spoof in a night-time raid at sea. Finn McMissile (voiced by Michael Caine) is a sleek English Austin with a line on the grille suggesting a David Niven-like mustache. Hes trying to photograph a top-secret camera on board a ship carrying the monocle-wearing German scientist Professor Z (Thomas Kretschmann). As semi-amusing as the idea of anthropomorphized cars acting out a 007 scenario is the opening teaser sets up a shadow of doubt that the otherwise bright fast and shiny Cars 2 never quite escapes. David Niven? Spy thrillers? Germans in monocles? Just who is Pixar aiming this movie at? Contemporary children or their great-grandparents? Over the past 16 years Pixar has enjoyed one of the great runs of movies in Hollywood history ( Toy Story The Incredibles Up and Wall-E) but they havent all been aces. Cars 2 is the sequel to what is perhaps the weakest film in the Pixar chain 2006s Cars. The new movie is more ambitious but in noise and visual dazzle rather than storytelling chops. The idea here seems to be that if youre making a movie about cars you should appeal to car fans. That means a fast-moving action thriller that hops around the world to Tokyo London Paris and the Italian Riviera and features plenty of chases explosions and gadgets. For the auto-buff dads there are animated Fiats Mini Coopers and Rolls-Royces (as well as some evil AMC Gremlins and Pacers). Apparently fuelled more by prospective toy sales than any intrinsic narrative purpose Cars 2 varooms right under Pixars usually high bar. Unlike most Pixar fare this isnt a movie you can imagine many adults wanting to see without their children in tow. Shortly after the opening Cars 2 makes a pit stop in the familiar ground of the more homespun first instalment in the small desert town of Radiator Springs where race car Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) is enjoying some between-race downtime with friends Sally (Bonnie Hunt) Ramone (Cheech Marin) and Tow Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) the motor-mouthed buck-toothed-hick tow truck. Mater in response to a radio call-in show gets Lightning signed up for the new World Wide Grand Prix created by British tycoon Miles Axlerod (based on Virgins Richard Branson voiced by Eddie Izzard). Axlerod wants to promote his new renewable non-fossil fuel Allinol. Lightnings main rival is the preening Italian Formula One champion Francesco Bernoulli (John Turturro hamming it up on all cylinders). On the advice of Sally Lightning decides to bring Mater along a decision he soon regrets when Maters hick ways prove a social embarrassment. In Tokyo (with a beautifully rendered skyline) Mater mistakes wasabi for pistachio ice-cream and leaks oil in public. He is mistaken for an American spy by Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer) a Miata-like agent who works with Finn McMissile. Theyre trying to thwart a dastardly plan to sabotage the race by someone working for Big Oil. As for the relationship stuff that usually forms the heart of Pixars films it feels almost extraneous here. Lightning disowns his rough-mannered friend who becomes the films protagonist and fires off a constant stream of auto-related puns and malapropisms. His blue-collar shtick grows increasingly tiresome as the pace accelerates. By the time the movie screeches across the finish line theres just time for the standard Pixar message about the importance of sticking by your friends - no matter how exhausting or full of exhaust they are.

"Cars 2 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; cars-2 ) Cars 2 (United States 2011) June 24 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli Seen in Disney 3-D. It was bound to happen a dud for Pixar. Making a sequel to 2006s Cars was always something of a head-scratcher. The original movie while possessing a certain charm was among the studios least inspired efforts and the death of Paul Newman (Cars was his final big-screen role) left a hole at the emotional center (the student/mentor relationship between Owen Wilsons Lightning McQueen and Newmans Doc Hudson). The development of Cars 2 seems to have been driven as much by merchandising wants as creative needs. After all its easier to sell cars than Ed Asner. The Disney/Pixar label assures box office success but especially in the case of a high profile family film that has minimal correlation with actual quality. And although it would be unfair to label Cars 2 as unwatchable it is surprisingly tedious in parts and not as satisfying as one might expect. To give the filmmakers credit at least they try to take Cars 2 in a new direction rather than making it a re-tread of Cars. For this installment the focus shifts to Mater the tow truck (voice of Larry the Cable Guy) and two new characters British spies Finn McMissile (Michael Caine) and Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer). Lightning McQueen has a significant role but this isnt ""his"" show. In fact the most important thing he contributes is to illustrate the importance of friendship through his relationship with Mater. Usually Pixar does an excellent job of representing emotion. In this case however it feels forced and the associated ""message"" is presented with a minimum of elegance (a speech about friends). Following Cars Lightning has become a big time champion on the racing circuit and now he is being courted to participate in the World Grand Prix - an event that will take place in three locales (Japan Italys Riviera and England) and pit Lightning against Francesco Bernoulli (John Turturro) who claims to be the fastest car on Earth. Accompanying Lightning on the journey is Mater who will act as a member of the pit crew. Cloak-and-dagger stuff is happening behind the scenes however as the race appears to be at the center of international criminal activities. Investigating these are Finn a 007-inspired Aston-Martin and his faithful sidekick Holley. When they mistakenly identify Mater as an American spy the stage is set for the rural rusty truck to save the world and get the girl. Little about Cars 2 feels fresh and more fun seems to have been had coming up with character names than developing the story. Even though the narrative broadens the scope to the wide world (in addition to Japan Italy and England there are scenes in Paris and America) and puts the race on the back burner the movie is more obligatory than inspired. With its frequent nods to James Bond and other spy thrillers the movie makes sure even the uninitiated will recognize the inspiration. The action scenes of which there are several are disappointingly pedestrian doing little to raise the pulse. The comedy is mostly parody although it falls considerably short of the over-the-top outrageousness of the Austin Powers series. Visually Pixar has not slipped. Whatever the motivation for making Cars 2 the animators did not skimp in their attempts to dazzle. The cars are lovingly rendered and the great cities of the world are represented in all their bright neon glory. The 3-D is irrelevant often used with such subtlety as to appear almost 2-D. Pixar veteran director John Lasseter understands how to avoid most of 3-Ds common pitfalls including motion blur and washed-out colors but the ""extra dimension"" adds so little to this movie that one has to wonder why bother? The major voice actors excepting Newman return for this installment although many (like Bonnie Hunt) have little more than cameos. Owen Wilsons Lightning lacks personality - something that was not a problem in the first film. And while Michael Caine is suitably suave as the British superspy one has to ponder whether any of the ex-Bonds (or even the current one) were approached. Imagine Connery as Finn or Roger Moore Timothy Dalton or Pierce Brosnan... (Plus I kept wondering whether the voice was really Caine or whether it was supplied by Steve Coogan or Rob Brydon who give a clinic on how to imitate the great actor in The Trip.) Cars 2 lacks Pixars normal two-level sophistication despite attempts to deepen things with a subplot about the folly of relying on fossil fuels. It will probably work for kids although some of the longer less exciting stretches could result in restlessness. Adults on the other hand may be searching for a mature subtext that never emerges. This is no Toy Story 3. For families in search of generation-crossing entertainment Cars 2 provides a passable two hours although its value lies more in providing a bonding opportunity for parents and children than in whats on screen. Note Cars 2 is preceded by a Toy Story ""quickie"" that lacks the usual panache of pre-feature Pixar shorts. At about seven minutes in length it has little opportunity to do more than re-introduce a host of familiar characters. The benefit - to the extent that there is one - is that the voices are provided by the actors who contributed to the features (Tom Hanks Tim Allen etc.). Still when all was said and done I preferred the brief Toy Story add-on to the full-length Cars 2.

"Cars 2 movie review Needs a tuneup |       NJ.com comments Cars 2 movie review Needs a tuneup Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on June 24 2011 at 726 AM View/Post Comments DISNEY/PIXARAnimated characters Lightning McQueen voiced by Owen Wilson foreground left Mater voiced by Larry the Cable Guy center and Finn McMissile voiced by Michael Caine right are shown in a scene from ""Cars 2."" Cars 2 movie review It should be obvious -- although it shouldnt have to be immutable -- that studios and audiences look for different things in sequels. Fans want familiar characters returning in different circumstances. They want favorite catchphrases revived old jokes given a new twist and maybe a long-standing conflict resolved. The moviemakers want more money. In the past Pixar seemed to be different. They resisted sequels except for the ever-inventive ""Toy Story"" franchise. They were the people for whom ""good enough"" rarely seemed to be. Compared with ""Finding Nemo"" or ""Up"" the first ""Cars"" released in 2006 was an only-average effort. It became however the companys biggest merchandise-mover ever. And in the family-film business isnt selling toys what its all about? Well it never seemed to be the first thing on Pixars mind but its hard to come up with any other reason to make ""Cars 2."" As in the first film were in an alternate auto-driven world where there are no people -- just anthropomorphic machines racing around with big eyes and shiny grins. (The character designs remain for Pixar uncomfortably cutesy and broad.) And once again our supposed hero is race car Lightning McQueen voiced by perpetual dude Owen Wilson -- who you can be sure will learn a be-true-to-yourself lesson before the credits roll. Except this time the story is cluttered up with two major plots -- a retro-007 spy thriller (which the same company already spoofed and much better in ""The Incredibles"") and a round-the-world race. And neither really takes off because the film spends the vast majority of its time on the series least likable character -- the slow-on-the-uptake tow truck Mater. I guess someone must like Mater whos already had his own spinoff TV show. Just as someone must like Larry the Cable Guy who voices him. But that someone isnt me and if it isnt you youre in for one very long matinee. The backgrounds (which often include automotive details in the landscapes) are fun as are the details (at the car casino patrons play with fuzzy dice). And its nice to hear the chipper Michael Caine here voicing an old spy and Emily Mortimer who plays his assistant. But Mater steals the majority of the screentime and squanders it slowly drawling out the kind of corn-pone ""Now what in the Sam Hill wuz that?"" lines I thought went out with the first season of ""Petticoat Junction."" Listening to him is like watching molasses dry. There is one wonderful part that all on its own raises this to a two-star movie. Unfortunately its not actually in the movie but in the short that plays before it -- ""Hawaiian Vacation"" a ""Toy Story"" vignette that has Woody and Buzz trying to engineer a romantic trip for Ken and Barbie. Its inventive nicely animated and very very funny. Just like Pixar usually is. And will be again Im sure once they move a few million more plush tow trucks. Ratings note The film contains one very mild joke about automotive ""leaks."" Cars 2 (G) Disney (116 min.) Directed by John Lasseter and Brad Lewis.

As lovable as Mater is lets face it A little bit of Larry the Cable Guy goes a long way. Starring Owen Wilson Larry the Cable Guy Michael Caine Emily Mortimer Bonnie Hunt Tony Shalhoub Cheech Marin Jason Isaacs Joe Mantegna Peter Jacobson Director John Lasseter Brad Lewis Running time 153 Release Opened Jun 24 2011  Editorial Review Lightning Mater on the road againBy Michael OSullivanFriday June 24 2011""Cars 2"" features a lot more of two things Mater the rusty rednecky tow truck voiced by Larry the Cable Guy and car racing. On the surface this sounds as though the appeal of the sequel to the animated ""Cars"" might be limited somewhat to the NASCAR demographic or at least a whole lot more than the first film was. While there were a few racing scenes in the original 2006 film most of that story centered on the distinctive ""personalities"" of its talking-car characters -- hotshot stock car Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) cranky vintage racer Doc Hudson (Paul Newman) sexy Porsche Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt) -- and their relationships with one another. As lovable as Mater is lets face it A little bit of Larry the Cable Guy goes a long way.Fortunately ""Cars 2"" is a long looong way from Talladega not to mention from Radiator Springs the remote Southwestern town where Mater lives and where the first movie took place. Set in Tokyo London and a picturesque Italian village during a three-part international race to determine the fastest car in the world ""Cars 2"" boasts eye-popping scenery of far-flung locales and thrilling race sequences. Its a visually stunning film. Unfortunately the sequel shortchanges the very relationships that gave the first movie its surprising heart. The overly complicated plot of ""Cars 2"" centers on a mystery -- specifically a secret weapon that threatens Lightning and his fellow racers and the identity of the shadowy figure whos using it. Two British secret agents are on the case Finn McMissile (Michael Caine) and Holly Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer). McMissile unsurprisingly bears more than a passing resemblance to James Bonds tricked-out Aston Martin if designed by Inspector Gadget. Its very cleverly done.In general so is the entire film. But cleverness is no substitute for emotion. The intrigue -- in which Mater gets mixed up when hes taken for an American spy -- excites but does not engage. A subplot involving a rift in Mater and Lightnings friendship feels perfunctory like an attempt to tack a moral onto a thriller. Many of the films best gags have to do with the comic culture shock Mater experiences abroad as when he encounters a high-tech Japanese toilet during the leg of the race in Tokyo. Actually its part toilet part repair bay complete with hydraulic lift and automatic parts washer. As in the first film the car-centric world brought to vivid life by directors John Lasseter and Brad Lewis writer Ben Queen and the Pixar animation team is beautifully imagined. The film is full of wry automotive takes on human life such as the quick almost throwaway shot of cars moving through airport security -- with their tires removed. As he did with ""The Incredibles"" and numerous other film scores chameleonic composer Michael Giacchino beautifully evokes the jazzy jet-setting music that propelled old spy thrillers and their subsequent spoofs. (Think Burt Bacharach in ""Casino Royale."")But as smart-looking and as sharp-sounding as ""Cars 2"" mostly is the central mystery about the identity of the villain -- a car whose engine has been identified but whose body is never shown and whose voice has been electronically altered -- just isnt much of a mystery. At least not for anyone who has seen more than one or two ""Scooby-Doo"" cartoons. That said theres enough to like about ""Cars 2"" to make for a pleasant ride. It may not be fully loaded but theres still enough gas in the tank to get you around the track one more time.Contains nothing offensive.

They said it couldnt be done. But Pixar proved the yaysayers wrong when it made its first bad movie ""Cars."" Now it has worsted itself with the even more awful ""Cars 2."" This international toy fair and pun emporium billed as a movie relies painfully on the redneckery of Larry the Cable Guy an alleged but not proven comedian whose country corn-pone act makes Jeff Foxworthy look like Gore Vidal. Mr. The Cable Guy inexplicably has the lead role as the broken-down old tow truck Tow Mater (one of many not-good puns -- its supposed to sound like a hillbilly saying ""Tomato"" I guess). Owen Wilsons Lightning McQueen easily the blandest Pixar hero ever but not as actively grating as LCGs character spends the movie in the background trying to win a worldwide Grand Prix split into races in London Italy and ""Towkyo"" (ouch). Mater keeps embarrassing Lightning with his cracker-barrel goof-ups but eventually becomes the critical element of a spy plot. He is carrying information sought by a debonair British secret agent car Finn McMissile (Michael Caine by far the best thing in this mess) and his assistant Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer). Meanwhile an eccentric billionaire (Eddie Izzard) who has invented a new alternative fuel he supplies to all of the Grand Prix racers is dismayed to find all the cars that use the new carbon-free fuel blowing up. All of this has something to do with a prologue in which Finn discovers shady goings-on at a deep-sea oil platform. Much of the comic energy is generated by those dumb puns (karate is ""carate"" a sportscaster is Brent Mustangburger) and the strangulating central whim about what would happen if cars ran the world. Occasionally this yields mild amusement -- I liked the 10W-40 martinis -- but it shouldnt rule the movie. ""Cars"" and its sequel are the only Pixar offerings that are based on a gag rather than a story. A lot of the bits dont even make sense (a cigarette girl who sells air fresheners?) and some of them sound like they could have been written by the average 9-year-old in the audience such as ""Youll be finished at the finish line"" When Mater is carrying a bomb Lightning tells him ""Youre the bomb"" But a London billboard reading ""Lassetyre"" a reference to the films director John Lasseter looks like a typo. Surely they meant Lassetired? In much the same way that a pleading nightclub comic might say ""Is anyone here from a foreign country?"" ""Cars 2"" makes a show of its globalism zinging around the planet to mollify important markets -- sorry countries But any movie that makes you sit through all of (a cover of) the Cars ""You Might Think"" should be cited with international human-rights charges. (Nor does the song have anything to do with cars.) Almost as appalling is the closing number about colliding worlds in which Brad Paisley and Robbie Williams sing the merits of coffee versus tea and gasoline versus petrol but wind up proving that cliche knows no nation. The various culture check-ins yield nothing more interesting than sumo-wrestling cars guard-cars wearing bearskin helmets at the entrance to Buckingham Palace and John Turturros Luigi Risotto accent as Lightnings arrogant Italian rival Francesco. The message of the film is (ultimately) that Mater should be himself and not worry about how badly he makes everyone around him cringe particularly in cosmopolitan places. But apart from one moment of improbable brilliance Mater really is an insufferable moron. In Japan he ingests heaps of what he thinks is pistachio ice cream (actually wasabi). ""Dump trucks is dumb"" he says and boasts of his martial-arts skills ""I got me a black fan belt"" He accidentally activates secret spy weapons by saying ""Shoot"" With his whistle-through-the-teeth delivery LCG makes such lines transcendentally irritating. The one clever notion is that the lemons of the world (the Pacer the Gremlin the East German Trabant one of which was once photographed after the fall of the Berlin Wall sitting comfortably and justly in a Dumpster) are jealous villains trying to sabotage the dream machines. But this idea is awkwardly affixed to the plot about controlling global oil supplies -- could rust buckets really master the world? -- and anyway the most prominent clunker on-screen is the main character. Things are so dull rote and humorless that when signboards in a European scene read ""Mondiale Grand Prix"" I at first thought they said ""Mondale Grand Prix"" which sounds like an unwanted award this movie could easily win. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Sean Kingston released from hospital Read Next Sean Kingston released from hospital Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 24724 How Hillary blew her big moment 15238 Malia Obama skipped the DNC for Lollapalooza 10179 Cop in bikini tackles bad guy Now On Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary Jill and Joe Biden stop traffic on Fifth Avenue SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Joe Neumaier Friday June 24 2011 400 AM Title Cars 2 Animated adventure involving a tow truck caught up in international intrigue. With the voices of Larry the Cable Guy Owen Wilson Michael Caine. Director John Lasseter. (153). G. At area theaters. With Porsches and Jaguars rolling out of Pixar annually you can excuse some occasional clank and knock. So ""Cars 2"" cruises in looking polished and if theres very little under the hood its surely because this savvy and sensitive company has unapologetically made a movie for (very) young moviegoers. Does that translate into less subtlety with storytelling underbody thats a bit exhausting? Sure but that wont matter to the kids buckling themselves in for a movie just for them. To that crowd - mostly boys who have watched the grooves off their DVDs of the original ""Cars"" -- this is a ride theyll sit still for. When last seen in the 2006 hit Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson) was embracing life in sleepy Radiator Springs. Now a local celebrity he reluctantly takes his best pal Mater the Tow truck (Larry the cable guy) into his pit crew for big races despite Maters talent for messing up even the most simple situation. When Lightning is challenged by a supersmooth Italian sports car (John Turturro) to a World Grand Prix sponsored by alternative-fuel industrialist Sir Miles Axelrod (Eddie Izzard) he brings Mater along. Then the dopey tow is mistaken for a secret agent by Finn McMissile (Michael Caine) the spy car -- an Aston Martin of course -- tracking mysterious goings-on at the race and looking to stop a devious German coupe known as Professor Z. Pixars decision to make the corny Mater their main character rather than McQueen tilts this great-looking but unchallenging movie fully into kiddie territory. With Larry the Cable Guys grating Gomer Pyle-ish delivery and a wide-eyed innocence that drives him from one misadventure to the next Mater is only a few gears above the typical cartoon creation. And whereas the first movies lessons about appreciating a slower pace and the way the world once lived contained Pixars trademark subtlety -- junior division -- the sequels message about standing by friends and remaining true to yourself is nice but well standard. Nonetheless director John Lasseter and his teams pitch-perfect way with genre cliches revs up the espionage subplot. And if these talking autos have less soul than the toys robots superheroes and soaring senior citizens that populate their other worlds that wont matter to the grade-school lot. What they want and what they get is more fuel for car-themed imagination. Magic moment Lightning McQueens arrival in a Tokyo-like city with more auto-themed neon signs than you can shake a stick shift at.

It was a feature steeped in nostalgia crammed full of mawkish city-slicker-learns-to-appreciate-life cliches and a cast full of small-town archetypes. Gone was the sense of ingenuity that usually counterbalanced the studios standard sentiment; even with gorgeous animation it was a lazy movie lovingly assembled not to mention a slam-dunk for toy sales. Now Pixar has done the seemingly impossible they made a better film and did so while also making redneck tow truck sidekick Mater (voiced by Larry the Cable Guy) the lead. Yes the fish-out-of-water tables have turned with champion race car Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) offering to show Mater the world outside of Radiator Springs as McQueen competes in a globe-trotting grand prix organized by oil tycoon-turned-environmentalist Miles Axelrod (Eddie Izzard). However sabotage is in the air and as the crew travels from Tokyo (here Towkyo) to Italy to London the typically aloof Mater becomes increasingly mistaken for a deep cover agent by British intelligence operatives Finn McMissile (Michael Caine) and Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer). At the total expense of the first films noble ""slow down"" message Cars 2 is Pixars loving attempt to emulate the adventures of James Bond and an excuse to work in full-blown chases and fights alongside Lightnings proper races (themselves as devotedly detailed as ever -- check the exhaust vapors on the track). The opening escape sequence is a doozy and although its surreal to see anthropomorphized automobiles wielding weapons at one another director John Lasseter and co-director Brad Lewis treat the stakes as highly as they would in any other action film. The plot itself grows a bit convoluted leading to patches of wheel-spinning (sorry) but its a generally inspired espionage riff all the same bolstered throughout by Michael Giacchinos game score. The lessons at hand are typically pat as Lightning learns to appreciate a friend hes grown to resent (for acting like a complete buffoon) and Mater comes to understand how others perceive him (as a complete buffoon). Cable Guy still lays on his yeehaw mentality a little thick but maybe its just the absence of lugnut jokes the presence of lowered expectations or the constant support of the always sage Michael Caine that makes his character slightly less insufferable than before. As for the logic of a world where cars eat sushi as well as conventional fuel and are forced to enter metal detectors at the airport (an initially amusing sight gag that invites more disturbing implications) forget it. Either the concept works or it doesnt. I do consider Cars 1 to be decidedly minor in the span of the Pixar canon and despite its pleasures Id rank Cars 2 similarly. If anything its the closest the studio has come so far in cranking out something like a DreamWorks effort a cartoon that is inspired in the moment and yet inconsequential in the scheme of things. Like many DreamWorks efforts of late its a worthwhile diversion. The 3-D while well-rendered mutes the vibrant color palette -- but lets hope that Lasseter and friends soon return to the emotional ambition that has made Pixar such a reliable brand to date.

EnlargeClose Disney/Pixar Up in the air The race car Lightning McQueen left (voiced by Owen Wilson) and tow truck Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) take flight. Though many of the visuals are winningly vibrant and sleek what is lacking here is Pixars most notable characteristic a compelling clever story and boundless heart. The characters -- talking living cars -- are nowhere near as likable emotionally rich or complex as the playthings of the Toy Story movies the rodents of Ratatouille the undersea creatures of Finding Nemo or the endearing robot of WALL-E. Where the original Cars (2006) lagged somewhat behind the rest of the exceptional Pixar pack Cars 2 in computer-animated 3-D seems to idle in neutral. PHOTOS Cars race to the box office MORE Michael Caine loves technology VIDEO Preview Cars 2 The news that the film was directed by John Lasseter the affable Pixar mastermind who gave us the first Toy Story raised hopes that this would be another Up or Toy Story 3. Pixar movies are so much more evolved than most other fare -- animated or live action -- that watching Cars 2 feels like stumbling on a Neanderthal amid a corps of advanced Homo sapiens. Cars 2   1/2 out of four Voices Owen Wilson Larry the Cable Guy Michael Caine Emily Mortimer John Turturro Bonnie Hunt Directors John Lasseter and Brad Lewis DistributorWalt Disney Pictures Rating G Running time 1 hour 53 minutes Opens Friday nationwide Race car champ Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) has just returned to Radiator Springs to spend some time with his hometown pals. But almost as soon as he arrives hes challenged to race overseas in the first World Grand Prix a contest to determine the worlds fastest car. He takes his pit crew buddies along and adds rusty tow truck Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) who means well but botches things up for Lightning. Mater is such an overgrown toddler that he leaks petrol in excitement. (This gussied-up bathroom humor seems a rare effort to pander to very young viewers.) Lightning faces an archrival Italian race car Francesco Bernoulli (John Turturro) and Mater gets embroiled in a top-secret spy mission at the behest of British super-spy Finn McMissile (Michael Caine) and his cohort Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer). Lightning and Mater face a bump in the road when it comes to their long friendship but the message about loyalty is a sound one. In contrast to the nostalgia-drenched original this retread is an amalgam of spy movies sort of James Bond-lite on auto-pilot. Though the locales are more far-flung than Radiator Springs the movie doesnt benefit from the exotic spots and polyglot voices. A lot of locations are raced through but the events happening in them are less than fascinating. A few ingenious action sequences benefit from the 3-D technology but too much emphasis is placed on explosions high-octane road races and watered-down global intrigue. Mild humor is interspersed. But will young kids follow the convoluted mystery surrounding an oilfield and possibly compromised alternative fuel? Something Pixar animation has never been is formulaic. But Cars 2 teeters on the brink. Its not that its a bad film. But the bar is high and its lackluster and predictable missing that alchemic blend of humor pathos and indelible characters that give Pixar movies their brilliant shine.

"Movie review Cars 2 - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review Cars 2Pixars inventive sequel brings back its familiar characters and throws in a spy thriller plot with secret weapons sinister villains and clandestine agents. It also teaches kid-friendly lessons about friendship and being yourself.June 24 2011|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Its Pixar Animations 25th anniversary and the studio has kicked back and given a present to itself and its ever-expanding audience with the genially entertaining ""Cars 2."" A movie that loves autos and doesnt care who knows it ""Cars 2"" is so close to the heart of John Lasseter that he carved out time from being the creative czar of both Pixar and Disney animation to direct it himself the first time Lasseters done that since well the original ""Cars"" five years ago. But to expect simply a revisiting of the gang from Radiator Springs is to underestimate the Pixar philosophy. ""Cars 2"" takes the studio into unexpected new territory by bringing its familiar characters to a ""Bourne Identity""-type spy thriller complete with secret weapons sinister villains and clandestine agents calling frantically for backup. Though it spends time in familiar Carburetor County ""Cars 2"" also goes far afield geographically unleashing racing whiz Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson) and his best pal Tow Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) on the rest of the world as Lightning travels to Paris and competes in the World Grand Prix in Tokyo London and the fictional Italian Riviera town of Porto Corsa. More than visiting these metropolises ""Cars 2"" is able to do what Pixar calls ""car-ify"" them. It reimagines these places in a remarkably detailed way as if cars (the film boasts 145 unique car characters) were the people who built and lived in these cities putting ""car-goyles"" on Notre Dame and turning Londons Big Ben into ""Big Bentley"" complete with Bentley grills and hood ornaments. ""Cars 2"" also makes entertaining and inventive use of 3-D technology. With a plot that includes life-and-death action sequences thrilling auto races and panoramic scenic vistas the opportunities for enhanced perspective are considerable and the Pixar team makes better use of them than most live-action films. Despite all these technological wonders ""Cars 2"" never forgets the heartfelt sensibility that is its dramatic heritage. Written by Ben Queen (the creator of Fox TVs ""Drive"") from a story by Lasseter and Brad Lewis ""Cars 2"" teaches gentle kid-friendly lessons about the importance of friendship and being yourself and introduces some great new characters in its parallel spy drama and auto racing plots. ""Cars 2"" opens in the middle of its spy drama and introduces suave sophisticated secret agent Finn McMissile. Impeccably voiced by Michael Caine McMissile is totally unflappable in all situations even being pursued on the top of an oil platform by the dreaded Professor Z (Thomas Kretschmann) and his merciless automotive minions. Back in Radiator Springs Lightning McQueen is looking forward to spending an off-season kicking back with best friend Mater and best girl Sally (Bonnie Hunt). But he gets drawn into that World Grand Prix the creation of billionaire Sir Miles Axlerod (Eddie Izzard) a reformed oil tycoon who now is pushing an alternative fuel called Allinol. Also a factor in McQueens decision to race is his irritation at the sky-high smugness of his chief rival Italian Formula One car Francesco Bernoulli hilariously voiced by John Turturro as a self-involved individual given to saying things like ""when I want to go to sleep I watch one of McQueens races."" At the instigation of Sally McQueen takes Mater along on the world tour and the clueless tow trucks bumbling irrepressible innocence proves to be a problem from stop one in Tokyo where he mistakes a dish of red-hot wasabi for a helping of pistachio ice cream. Things get even more complicated when in a ""North by Northwest"" case of mistaken identity everyone including McMissile and his inexperienced colleague Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer) not to mention the nefarious bad guys assume Mater is an ace secret agent with one heck of a cover. As if. With engaging characters a plot that ensures energy and such a wealth of auto references (it even features a song originally performed by the Cars a ""You Might Think"" done here by Weezer) ""Cars 2"" has a smooth easy way about it. These creations have become like family to Lasseter as well as to each other and they never fail to make us smile. kenneth.turanlatimes.com Cars 2 MPAA rating G Running time 1 hour 46 minutes Playing In general release MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESDisneys Pixar planning Incredibles sequel and a third...March 19 2014The real Route 66 inspirations behind Disneys Cars LandJanuary 5 2013El Capitan rides high with Cars 2 World Grand Prix...July 14 2011For John Lasseter Pixars boyish visionary Cars 2 is a...June 21 20112011 Movie Preview Cars 2January 16 2011MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesPixarCarsEntertainmentCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-cars-2-20110624,0,2158087.story?track=rss",200,cars215,cars2,latimes

Photo Courtesy Of Pixar/Disney Cars 2 review Spy plot revs up sequel 1 / 1 Back to Gallery ""Cars 2"" the latest from Pixar is the sequel to the 2006 ""Cars"" from the same studio but its a much different movie. It mostly keeps the same lineup of characters and maintains the conceit of a world in which people dont exist and cars talk and have emotions. But in terms of story and atmosphere and overall feeling ""Cars 2"" is a brand-new experience - and a distinct improvement. The previous ""Cars"" was pretty much a coming-of-age drama in which an ambitious young car (Owen Wilson) learned life lessons. Inevitably it was sentimental. But ""Cars 2"" is a spy story taking place against an international background. Its lively and packed with incident and serious consequence and even without the cars gimmick - with a few adjustments to convert the script from cars to people - the movie would work. Its solid enough to stand on its own and the car aspect is just a plus a charming whimsical embellishment. This time out the cars no longer seem so earthbound so locked into being heavy hunks of metal that can barely touch. The cars as physical entities have been reconceived as more pliable and interactive and one gets the sense that technology - that is movie technology - has aided in this. The whole visual atmosphere of ""Cars 2"" is more expansive and free than its predecessor and more of a delight to watch. Related Stories Cars 2 Owen Wilson is back as Lightning McQueen now established as one of the worlds premier race cars. Larry the Cable Guy is the voice of the rusty tow truck Mater who becomes central to the story and in shrewd ways. New to the scene is Michael Caine as a car working for the British secret service along with his assistant (Emily Mortimer). The British agent discovers that some kind of diabolical international conspiracy is afoot and soon the players all converge on Europe where a series of races will determine who is the fastest car in the world. It might seem strange that locations should play an important role in an animated film and yet ""Cars 2"" really does benefit from the glamour of its settings which tells you just how well theyre realized. The movie travels to Paris to Italy and to London and the re-creations of these cities are hardly perfunctory. The detailing is specific but with subtle and clever alterations made to accommodate that these are cities for cars not people. In ""Cars 2"" we meet some of the legendary lemons of yesteryear - Gremlins Yugos Pacers - cars you might have regarded as forlorn or unlucky but here theyre villains with chips on their shoulders angry that no one makes parts for them any longer. Like a lot of things in this movie that notion is funny in the abstract but it also works as part of the storys psychological grounding. Among the many nice touches is the soundtrack with its hint of 60s-era British spy movies. Incidental and yet very much a part of the background is an underlying message about the relative morality of big oil companies and major conglomerates. Thats not something you expect to get in what is essentially a kids film but its not uninteresting and not unwelcome. Owen Wilson has a recognizable earnestness in his voice and Larry the Cable Guy gets some of the best laughs. But the treat of ""Cars 2"" is Michael Caine who seems quite at home in his car incarnation. If he were a car this is precisely the kind of car he would be. Cars 2 Animation.

Satiric surreal fun; Bad Teacher and star Diaz make no grade Watch a clip from the film ""Cars 2"" courtesy Walt Disney Pictures. By Joe Morgenstern June 24 2011 Five years ago when ""Cars"" proved to be Pixars first less-than-stellar animated feature an animator friend offered his theory about why. Cars he said can have faces but they dont have hands; theres only so much you can have them do. To make up for their lack of hands the cars in ""Cars 2"" do all sorts of cool things with their front tires and the 3-D animation as a whole is spectacular. But the movie has its own deficits--a lack of variety originality subtlety clarity and plain old charm. The law of averages has finally caught up with the most remarkable studio in modern movie history the dream factory that lived up to Buzz Lightyears joyous cry of ""To infinity and beyond."" This frenzied sequel seldom gets beyond mediocrity. ENLARGE Lightning McQueen and Tow Mater in Cars 2. Disney/Pixar Theres certainly no lack of clarity in the calculations behind Pixars swerve. In the five years since ""Cars"" was released the movie has sold something in the neighborhood of 10 billion in merchandise--cute little cars trucks and other vehicles that keep rolling off the toymakers assembly lines in epic numbers. To sustain such financial numbers--and to pave the way for next summers opening of a 12-acre Cars Land at Disneys California Adventure Park--Pixar and Disney the animation studios relatively new owner needed a hard-sell crowd-pleaser with exactly the sort of high-octane action and high-decibel soundtrack that energizes--or blights depending on your point of view--""Cars 2."" This is something new for Pixar a movie in which characterization and deep feelings take a back seat to breakneck pace and something new for Pixar lovers including me who may find themselves wondering if Disneys master merchandisers are starting to call the tune for Pixars master storytellers. The story here concerns a pair of American innocents abroad--Lightning McQueen the bright-red race car brightly voiced by Owen Wilson and Tow Mater the buck-toothed good-hearted tow truck who speaks in the cornpone tones of Larry the Cable Guy. Taking their leave of Radiator Springs the time-warpy desert town that served as the setting for ""Cars"" the two buddies head for Europe where Lightning enters the first of several competitions in the World Grand Prix and Mater is mistaken for a spy. The repetitive race sequences--vroom vroom vrooming at warp speed--are intercut with a James Bond spoof that centers on Finn McMissile a supercar with superweapons voiced by Michael Caine and that starts the action in a preface set on a giant oil platform at sea. (The preface to ""Toy Story 3"" which was absurdly and delightfully over the top turned out to be Andys fantasy. This one elaborate but clumsy is part of the narrative.) From one moment to the next ""Cars 2"" comes up with plenty of visual zingers a Parisian marche aux pieces (as in spare parts); a plunge into the giant clockworks of Londons Big Bentley; a Japanese toilet designed to pamper any chassis; exotic cars galore including such exotic lemons as the Pacer the Gremlin and what the movie calls the Hugo. And as cool as the story tends to be on a scale of emotional temperature it does evoke an affecting friendship between Lightning and Mater one thats tested by driving ambition and a deadly bomb. Still this is a Pixar animated feature were talking about a film from the people who brought genuine enchantment into our lives with tales of toys come alive of beguiling bugs fantastical fishies impassioned robots and self-reflective superheroes. Whats more its a film co-directed (with Brad Lewis) by John Lasseter the man who more than anyone else has embodied the studios spirit from the days when he used a computer to create a pioneering Pixar short about a couple of desk lamps. By now its a commonplace that Mr. Lasseter whose father was a parts-department manager in a Chevy dealership in Southern California was prompted to make the first ""Cars"" by profound car love. That film for all its odd mixture of tedium and frenzy operated within recognizable Pixar parameters. But in this one cars seem unconstrained by the laws of physics and writers seemed unconcerned with developing character as opposed to belaboring it. (Mater gets to be as maddening as that old Hollywood yodeler Andy Devine.) For Pixars sake and for ours lets hope that the fast track of ""Cars 2"" is a temporary detour. Watch a clip from the film ""The Names of Love"" courtesy Music Box Films. ENLARGE Sara Forestier and Jacques Gamblin in The Names of Love. Music Box Films The Names of Love ""Our two families embody France"" says Baya Benmahmoud the delightful heroine of Michel Leclercs sharp-witted sometimes surreal and largely autobiographical French-language comedy which he directed from a script he wrote with Baya Kasmi. So they do in many ways though not necessarily in the amorous way one might infer from the misleading English title. Baya who is played by Sara Forestier has an earnest Algerian father and a screwy French mother. The filmmakers surrogate Arthur Martin (Jacques Gamblin) has a Jewish mother of immigrant parents and a father who served in the Algerian war. The political intricacies on both sides are too complex to detail here while the comedy flows with daunting fluency from the ostensibly mismatched lovers. Baya a sentimental left-winger who is as volatile as she is alluring sleeps with conservatives in order to convert them; she considers her body a weapon with which to destroy the right wing. Arthur a middle-age middle-of-the-roader studies bird flu as a scientist; at one point he cant sleep with Baya because he must perform a necropsy on suspect geese. ""The Names of Love"" isnt a completely misleading title since love along with lovemaking does prevail. Still the original title ""Le Nom des Gens""--literally ""Peoples Names""--comes much closer to conveying the storys essence. Mr. Leclercs movie in French with good English subtitles often plays like romantic comedy but its really a sophisticated burlesque about the significance of surnames (his is comically common hers misleads people into thinking shes Brazilian) plus some quintessentially French obsessions the trap of racial identity; the politics of ethnicity and the fateful power of the past populated as it is for Baya and Arthur by ancestors who suffered for them dreamed for them and loved them. ENLARGE Cameron Diaz in Bad Teacher. Columbia Pictures Watch a clip from ""Bad Teacher"" starring Cameron Diaz Justin Timberlake and Jason Segel. Bad Teacher From the evidence on screen no one who made this alleged comedy ever noticed that no one in it was remotely likable. The heroine Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz) has been teaching at a middle school to kill time until her impending marriage to a rich guy. Her academic qualifications are never in evidence but she is manifestly a lazy cynical oversexed unprincipled foul-mouthed pot-puffing booze-slugging gold-digging slut who is not only dislikable but unfunny. Then her marriage plans go awry and her flaws multiply. Have talented actors ever struggled so much to so little avail? Ms. Diaz sells her lines like a street vendor peddling fake Timexes. Lucy Punch mugs and pouts as Elizabeths rival Amy Squirrel. Justin Timberlake plays the creepily fey Scott Delacorte a rich substitute teacher who sings a ghastly song called ""Simpatico."" (""Ask me how much I love you. A lottico."") Only Jason Segel finds a few fugitive flashes of likability--yes Im backtracking a bit here--as a gym teacher named Russell Gettis. (Lots more gravitas in that name than in Squirrel.) How did ""Bad Teacher"" which was directed by Jake Kasdan come into being? Maybe someone having seen Jack Black in ""The School of Rock"" decided to do something even raunchier with a female teacher (and failed to notice that both the star and his material were terrifically funny.) Or maybe the production began--as it should have ended--with the clever risque poster that shows among other things Ms. Diaz with her booted feet on a teachers desk. How much do I loathe this film? A lottico is putting it mildico. DVD FOCUS A Bugs Life (1998) The second Pixar feature this animated fable teems with vivid creatures standing on their own countless feet. The ant hero Flik (Dave Foley) wants to throw off the tyranny of the grasshoppers who led by the malevolent Hopper (Kevin Spacey) demand a huge cut of every harvest. Journeying forth to the big city in search of help Flik mistakes the members of a broken-down flea circus for puissant warriors brings them back home and presents them as the colonys saviors. The clowns redeem themselves but only by helping fearful antdom find the courage to get real and hang tough. Amelie (2001) Jean-Pierre Jeunets French-language fable isnt about racial identity or any of the other preoccupations of ""The Names of Love."" As a stylistic tour de force though it has been hugely influential on many filmmakers of varied ethnicities. First the film conjures up a telepathic but touchingly fragile heroine played by Audrey Tautou who rearranges other peoples lives even though shes terrified to live her own. Then the movie puts this elfin do-gooder/do-badder at the center of a fanciful world that looks like everyones idealized notion of Paris no crowds no dirt no traffic no permanent grief. Any Given Sunday (1999) Thinking about Cameron Diaz may not put you in mind of Oliver Stones movie about human worth vs. net worth but its entertaining all the same. Al Pacino is an aging coach who still thinks the game should be fun. Ms. Diaz is Christina Pagniacci a steely young franchise owner and Jamie Foxx is Willie Beamen a headstrong quarterback who brings Christinas team a star quality that she covets. If the field is tilted toward traditional values thats the fun of this fantasy version of the NFL in which morality finally proves a smoother lubricant than corporate moolah.

Every movie looks immaculate. Every character movement is precise. Most important the storytelling is drum-tight and eager to jump into grown-up themes -- the bond between father and son (Finding Nemo) the path to childhoods end (Toy Story 3) -- that all audiences can embrace.Only occasionally does a Pixar movie feel more like product than pleasure. The 2006 racing vehicle Cars is the companys most successful brand; its also the rare effort that comes up short of sublime. The new Cars 2 falls into the same category gorgeous sporadically fun sure to please your kids but short of Pixars own high standards.Heres the generous perspective Cars 2 is the best noisy action movie youll see this summer. It has super-spy cars (including a suave Aston Martin voiced by Michael Caine and tricked out with all manner of Bond-like gadgetry). It has international espionage including a Hitchcockian wrong-car mix-up involving Mater (a little Larry the Cable Guy goes a long way). It has some stunning race sequences one of them set in a neon-lit Tokyo reminiscent of Blade Runners Los Angeles.But that Mater mix-up starts spinning its wheels before long. The life-lesson subplot wherein Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) rejects his tow-truck friend from the sticks and suffers pangs of regret feels extraneous as does the prolonged intrigue surrounding a new petrol alternative. The 3-D like most 3-D these days serves no discernible purpose. Cars 2 eventually takes on the action beats of a Transformers movie (in case you forgot weve got another one of those around the corner).And yet On a visual craft level Cars 2 ranks near the top of the Pixar heap. The painterly Italian villa where one race unfolds is gasp-worthy. The swank Japanese party where Mater acts the rube and embarrasses his buddy is a marvel of design detail. Pixar never has a problem being clever and feeding the cineastes in the audience. The chief villain Professor Z is a German scientist modeled on a beat-up Zundapp Janus; he wears a Fritz Lang-style monocle over one eye. His lemon goon squad includes a Gremlin and a Pacer.Thats the crazy thing about Pixar Thanks to the grace notes and the obvious time and care invested the rare misfires or concessions to summer box office demands are as good as most outfits best work. It smarts a little when the gods descend to mere mortal levels. But when theres so much to look at and so many timely chuckles to enjoy you have to take the good with the bad. Cars 2 often acts like a lemon but the results still taste like lemonade.Cars 2B+ With the voices of Owen Wilson Larry the Cable Guy Michael Caine John Turturro Emily Mortimer Bonnie Hunt Thomas Kretschmann Eddie Izzard Joe Mantegna and others.

By Dana Stevens After youve seen Cars 2 check out our Spoiler Special discussion You can also download the program here or you can subscribe to the Spoiler Special podcast feed via iTunes or directly with our RSS feed. Lightning McQueen and Mater are back in Cars 2 Cars 2 (Disney) directed (like several great Pixar films of the last two decades) by John Lasseter finds itself in the unlucky position of the not-so-bright kid in a brilliant family. No matter if his performance in school is comfortably average; hell always be seen as a disappointment compared to his stellar siblings. Theres nothing really objectionable about Cars 2 although parents of young children should be warned that a few evil vehicles meet violently inauspicious ends. Its sweet-spirited visually delightful (if aurally cacophonous) and it will make for a pleasant enough family afternoon at the movies. But weve come to expect so much more than mere pleasantness from Pixar that Cars 2 feels almost like a betrayal. In an alternate world where motorized vehicles are the worlds sole inhabitants the tow truck Mater (voiced by the blue-collar comedian Larry the Cable Guy) welcomes his best friend Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson) back to their beloved town of Radiator Springs. Lightning having become a world-famous racecar in the interval since the first Cars movie in 2006 is returning home for some R amp; R. But when hes mocked on a sports show by a vain Italian racecar Francesco Bernoulli (John Turturro) the outraged Lightning signs up for the World Grand Prix an international race created by an oil tycoon whos introducing his newest alternate fuel. Advertisement Lightning Mater and the rest of the racing crew take off together for Japan France Italy and other destinations where theyre pursued both by a pair of sleek British spies (Michael Caine and Emily Mortimer) and a gang of resentful junkheaps--Gremlins Pacers--who have united under a mysterious and sinister leader to thwart the World Grand Prix from within. Their collective shenanigans make for a lot of plot. A little girl near me kept asking her dad ""Which cars are the bad guys? What are they doing?"" Her father shushed her politely but he would have done his fellow audience members a bigger favor by loudly and accurately answering her questions since we were just as stumped. So Cars 2 is incoherently plotted loud and overstuffed with big action set pieces--some of which like the opening chase scene on an offshore oil rig are spectacularly well-staged. That doesnt place it far below the average summer animated movie for kids with a little added value for adults in the form of clever visual (and less reliably verbal) jokes. Pixars ever-inventive designers have fun reimagining European landmarks for a car-based universe the Notre Dame cathedral with sculpted automotive saints in its porticoes was a lovely touch as was the kabuki show performed by Japanese subcompacts. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Maybe the biggest problem with Cars 2 comes down to the fact that the rustic rustbucket Mater rather than the neurotic nice-guy sportscar Lightning McQueen serves as the films protagonist and dominates nearly every scene. Amusing enough as a sidekick foil in the first Cars the buck-toothed intellectually challenged Mater begins to grate when allowed this much screen time. Mater is a cheerfully subcompetent rube with a minuscule learning curve not unlike Jim Nabors in Gomer Pyle. After being encouraged to spend the first three-quarters of the movie laughing at his negligible IQ and Amelia Bedelia-like propensity to take figures of speech literally were served a heavy-handed message about learning to accept our friends as they are. When we finally join Lightning McQueen again for the climactic last leg of the auto race weve almost forgotten what his motivations are for winning or why we should care. As disappointing as Cars 2 may be I cant join the ranks of critics hastening to rend their garments over the imminent decline of Pixar. Maybe Cars long acknowledged as one of the studios lesser efforts didnt need or deserve a sequel; maybe the screenwriter Ben Queen should have gotten an assist from the rugby team of writers who worked on the first film. But with 25 years of terrific films to their credit and multiple projects in the works--including Brave the first Pixar film to feature a female protagonist Monsters University a follow-up to the 2001 hit Monsters Inc. and an aviation-themed Cars spinoff called Planes--the Emeryville magic factory has earned the right to an off movie at least once every quarter of a century.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + This feels like the review in which Im supposed to report that it has finally happened Pixar has belched out a disaster and expects us to call it art. That ""Cars 2 is the animation auteurs running on fumes that its stuck in neutral that its a gas guzzler that its wrapped itself around a tree albeit a big astonishingly real-looking impossibly well-detailed tree. But Pixar already did that. It was called plain old ""Cars. ""Cars felt very much as if another company had followed a Pixar starter skit. It was what you thought DreamWorks would have done with access to all that rival visual wit but little of the vision. It was far from bad yet too close to ordinary.By 2006 the company had no one to blame but itself. After the mountain range comprising the first two ""Toy Story movies ""Monsters Inc. ""Finding Nemo and ""The Incredibles how dare it add only a molehill A story about the inner lives of automobiles feels like a cheap imitation of the inner life of Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head. The color and light had a pinball-machine pop. But cars with the teeth tongues and the sliding eyes of Pac-Mac hosts were not inherently appealing. Do you think more about carbon emissions when the vehicles are made to seem human? Or less? And couldnt you feel Pixar rolling its eyes at its own formula? Another lost hero another adventure another Randy Newman song another hit another animation Oscar nomination.With Pixar you dont taste a formula until you do. Then you cant taste anything else. ""Cars was the only time Ive tasted formula then thought God Im not an infant. Its worth noting that the following summer brought ""Ratatouille a movie about the joys of not serving formula and one imbued with daring a nominal childrens movie about a cooking rat The next summer was ""WALL-E loosely about junkyard life after the end of the world. The cars there were in a scrap heap.Its possible that Pixar thinks ""Cars is perfect. But the company isnt based in Hollywood. It hails from Emeryville Calif. which is just north of Silicon Valley and a philosophical universe away from Hollywood. Thats not a part of the world that rests on its laurels. Its a place that specializes in sequels not because it cant think of anything else but because it can think of nothing else. If Version One was good wait until you see Version Two.""Cars 2 isnt ""Toy Story 3 -- my soul never got in on the action. Conversely neither is it ""The Hangover Part II -- I at least had a soul when I left. The original movie has been debugged and rethought. Its funnier and sharper. Its just as long yet leaner and not anymore about the value of friendship over the thrill of winning. Well its no longer solely about that. ""Cars 2 is a summer movie about summer movies. It begins with a scene of espionage in which a sky blue Aston Martin/Peerless superspy (whose voice belongs to Michael Caine) watches murky doings at a dockyard warehouse. Warehouse sequences always feel like a setting of either last resort or least creativity -- its cheap to film there and no one will ever complain about the noise of shootouts or explosions. The Jason Stathams of the world might call it home. How amusing to see a cartoon go out of its way to play up a desperate live-action cliche. In any case the car and the spying are new and suggest that something more dynamic will occur than watching a stock car that spoke in Owen Wilsons drawl speed around racetracks and tour the open road. Indeed the stock car Lightning McQueen shares the foreground as opposed to dominating it and the movie widens its story. Lightning and his hick friend Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) a dilapidated bucktoothed car-repair tow truck have a falling out. Lightning is a superstar racer. Mater is the sort of embarrassment you cant take anywhere.At a party before a Grand Prix event with races in Tokyo London and the Italian Riviera Mater eats a bento of wasabi thinking its ice cream. In the mens room he winds up involved in one of those action sequences that is the only reason movie bathrooms exist. That leads to accidental field-agent work with the superspy and his partner (Emily Mortimer) a sleek purple car that looks like a Jaguar. Theyre trying to foil a terrorist-level conspiracy to discredit an alternative fuel called Allinol.Its a clever reshuffling of priorities. The sidekick of the first film becomes the hero of the second. And it must be said that pairing the lugubrious Waffle House twang of Larry the Cable Guy with the accent of Michael Caine might constitute the bravest sound effect you hear all summer.Pixar is a company that makes Crayola seem monochromatic. Why it continues to bother with 3-D is a mystery since the films often look better without it. Theres a wonderful climactic scene set along the Thames that is so sleek and well designed that it feels criminal to watch it through cheap plastic glasses. The same goes for a late lite-Hitchcock dream sequence. Really though as much as ""Cars 2 is a coloring book colored better than anything in the history of crayons its also pleasing to the ear. The director John Lasseter with his codirector Brad Lewis and the screenwriter Ben Queen has filled it with snazzy puns (a theater is playing ""The Incredimobiles) pivotal homonyms (""shoot versus ""chute for instance) stunt accents and language gags. Jenifer Lewis resumes her bit part from the first movie and I promise that no one has ever said ""coolant in a way that makes you want to both smoke a cigarette and cover your childs ears. The movie honors the senses by tickling them.Perhaps I wasnt entirely fair before. ""Cars wasnt just a movie from a kit. It was the purest approximation of the experience some kids have with their Hot Wheels. It was a little boys movie. A lot of vroom woo-hoo weee. But the thing about that experience is that its truly fun only if youre holding the cars. Theres more to ""Cars 2 than that. It better conducts and disperses the fun.This is an action movie that nods to Hayao Miyazaki and those sleeky dumb European chase thrillers with guys like Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson. There are lessons of self-acceptance (love your inner jalopy) reminders of old Hollywood capers like ""Charade and a knowing foray into bromance. If the references fail to delight you if they strike you as merely derivative the glee behind them is nonetheless palpable. Pixar seems to know that if its not broken it shouldnt be fixed -- I at least dont anticipate sequels of ""The Incredibles ""Ratatouille or ""WALL-E. But they also know theres always an excuse for a tuneup. The star of this sequel isnt the race car. Its the mechanic.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint With ""Cars 2"" Pixar goes somewhere new the ditch. Reprising its least-inspired effort (albeit one that has spawned a 2 billion aftermarket in toys T-shirts and lunchboxes) the studio has rolled out an inferior encore. ""Cars 2"" is one ""Cars"" too many. Is it awful? No just humdrum. Does it look astonishing? Yes but so do ""Transformers"" movies. Will children like it? Yes; they are children. Is it up to Pixars standards? It is so-so by DreamWorks standards. Saddled with a hectic story flat-lining character arcs and action sequences apparently conceived as levels for a video game ""Cars 2"" is all motion and no emotion. The film was directed by John Lasseter who oversees the entire animated output for both Pixar and Walt Disney Studios. Lasseters usually resonant approach of strong storytelling and memorable characters is sidelined here; maybe hes stretched thin. An aura of creative fatigue hangs over the film like diesel fumes. As we recall from his 2006 debut Lightning McQueen the speedy red racer voiced by Owen Wilson was once a stuck-up sophisticate. When fate trapped him in the sleepy desert town of Radiator Springs he lamented ""Im in hillbilly hell. My IQ is dropping by the minute. Im becoming one of them"" By the end of ""Cars"" the hotshot had learned to take life at a slower pace enjoying the homey burg and its amiable hicks. CARS 2  out of 4 stars Rating G. For their second outing Lightning takes a world tour with sidekick Tow Mater (a rusty salvage truck voiced by Danny Whitney aka Larry the Cable Guy). They pack plenty of clamor and shtick but scarcely any soul. With his lowbrow pal in tow to provide dumb jokes Lightning enters a globe-hopping Formula 1 race sponsored by an alternative-fuel magnate. With its elaborate international settings the film feels more bloated than big. At every stop Mater embarrasses Lightning with comments like ""Is the Popemobile Catholic?"" and mishaps with the toilets in Japan (there are numerous potty gags here besmirching Pixars reputation). In a second plot strand superspy Finn McMissile (Michael Caine) and his aide Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer) use their spy gear and firepower to bring down a cabal of clunkers scheming to sabotage the race. The first film was a gentle satire of salt-of-the-earth Americans -- and by extension the audience -- that was executed with aw-shucks charm. The sequel piles on scenes of Maters inappropriate idiocy as he becomes the lead character and Lightning recedes to the background. The country bumpkin is pulled into the spy thriller subplot through -- sigh -- mistaken identity and there we all are trapped in hillbilly hell our IQs eroding by the second. After brilliant films like ""The Incredibles"" and ""Ratatouille"" celebrated excellence and sophistication it stings to see a Pixar release champion a narrow ignorant worldview. We expect more than perfunctory time-wasters from the wizards who brought us ""Up"" the ""Toy Story"" series and ""Wall-E."" Heck we expect more than entertainment. We view their films to experience enchantment. This time we get disenchantment. The good news is that Pixar hasnt lost its touch. Before ""Cars 2"" begins theres ""Toy Story Hawaiian Vacation"" a playful short about the toys turning Bonnies room into a tropical paradise when Barbie and Kens plan to hitch a ride to Waikiki in Bonnies backpack goes awry. In under 6 minutes it delivers more laughs heart and art than the two-hour film that follows.

The visual and verbal puns break all land-speed records. Cars 2 the sporty sequel to the 2006 release widely considered the lemon in the Pixar cornucopia celebrates the little tow truck who could. More about Cars 2 >> But despite the bucktoothed charm of the truck named Mater and a plot that pays lip service to alternative fuels the John Lasseter-directed animation does not turn the lemon into lemonade. Speed can be a good thing in a car or a movie - but not when the scenery goes by too fast to understand where you are. Mater (voice of Larry the Cable Guy) a bucktoothed dented and rusty tow truck with an encyclopedic knowledge of all things automotive leaves the sleepy town of Radiator Springs N.M. to be the pit-crew boss for his pal Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson). The cherry-red racecar is favored to win an International Grand Prix that will take Mater and him to Tokyo Paris and London. Lightnings sponsor is Allinol an eco-friendly gas substitute developed by Sir Miles Axlerod (Eddie Izzard as the voice of a Land Rover) out to prove that clean fuel can win the race. Unbeknownst to Lightning and Mater British spies Finn McMissile (Michael Caine voice of an Aston-Martin) and Holley Shiftwell (a snappy convertible with the voice of Emily Mortimer) are investigating the ownership of mid-Atlantic oil rigs that may have a sinister connection with the Grand Prix. At the Tokyo meet Holley mistakenly identifies the slow-talking unworldly Mater as a brother spy. This has the effect of turbocharging the plot. The only sensible response is to fasten seat belts and not inhale the exhaust. While the plot may be too twisty for most kids (and adults) to follow the art of Cars 2 is as imaginative as anything Pixar has ever done. The cars are anthropomorphically envisioned with front wheels as hands and rear wheels as legs (Mater and Lightning give each other wheel bumps rather than fist bumps). The landmarks of Tokyo London and Paris are reimagined with charming automotive details. (And tributes to prior Pixar films with a Parisian mechanic called Gastows a nod to Gusteaus in Ratatouille.) But what good are all these details and inside jokes when the filmmakers speed past them so quickly that viewers will have to wait for the freeze-frame on their home-viewing system to catch them? Finally this Pixar effort has an engine where its heart should be. Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

(AP Photo/Disney/Pixar) <<123>>For many movie critics -- and more than a few film fans -- ""Cars"" is the closest thing to a pothole on the Pixar highway of success. When it first opened in 2006 the film was sliced and diced for being visually uninspired having characters that didnt have the same resonance one had come to expect in a Pixar movie and being just a bit too derivative in its storytelling (its plot resembled the 1991 live-action film ""Doc Hollywood"" a little too closely).Now five years later the studio is taking a second whack at ""Cars"" with the same director Pixar-Disney creative boss John Lasseter in charge. And everything has gone into hyperdrive for the sequel with the limited desert town setting of Radiator Springs abandoned for some serious globe-trotting and visually stunning set pieces (""Cars 2"" is so richly detailed that it reportedly used three times as much computing power as Pixars previous movie ""Toy Story 3""). In Theaters This Week Get showtimes watch movie trailers Bad Teacher Buck Cars 2 Cars 2 3D Cars 2 IMAX Conan O Brien Can t Stop Viva Riva Interviews with the stars hot new trailers But the heart of any Pixar film -- ""Toy Story"" (all three of them) ""Wall-E"" ""Up"" ""The Incredibles"" -- is storytelling with wit and emotion and characters that are instantly appealing. And like the original that is where ""Cars 2"" blows a tire.""Cars 2"" certainly opens with a bang a dazzling brilliantly-conceived chase sequence involving the films main new character British spy Finn McMissile (voiced in high style by Michael Caine). It is just the kind of breathtaking high-octane scene that jump-started the best of the James Bond movies with McMissile and the bad guys racing around a floating oil rig and eventually on ocean waters rendered with so much detail that you half expect to get hit by a crashing wave. The smart jumpy score by Michael Giacchino (now Pixars go-to guy for music) manages to suggest the opening music of the Bond films without being a copycat.Advertisement The film then jump-shifts to Radiator Springs the dusty sleepy town off Route 66. The place has undergone a decided face-lift since the first movie as it is now the home of race car champion Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson). But no sooner has Lightning returned to the town and his gang of friends then he is sucked into joining a World Grand Prix being staged by billionaire Miles Axelrod (Eddie Izzard) to promote a new revolutionary alternative fuel called Allinol. Lightnings chief rival Formula One champion Francesco Bernoulli voiced by John Turturro who serves up a heavy slice of ham (but at least its prime ham).Since his regular pit crew isnt available Lightning recruits some of his Radiator Springs posse to fill in -- including the unsophisticated but sweet Mater the tow truck (Larry the Cable Guy channeling his inner Jim Nabors from ""Gomer Pyle""). And at that point ""Cars 2"" turns into Maters movie with the rusty truck moving from comic sidekick to protagonist.At the first Grand Prix stop -- a superbly-executed Tokyo that is all neon and glitter -- Mater proves a real fish out of water embarrassing Lightning at a lavish party and damaging their friendship. But he also finds himself cluelessly caught up in a nefarious plot to sabotage the race and destroy the reputation of Axelrods alternative fuel as Finn McMissile and his associate Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer) mistake him for an American spy. (They keep complimenting Mater on the brilliance of his disguise as a dimwitted tow truck.)With that ""Cars 2"" zooms off to the roads of seaside Italy and the streets of London and Paris as Lightning continues his battle with Bernoulli in the Grand Prix and Mater McMissile and Holley try to stop the gang of bad guys (entirely made of such ""classic"" lemons as the Pacer and the Yugo). The details and animation in these sequences are so beautifully conceived and executed that you almost forget youre really not getting involved in the story or with the characters. Eventually Lightning and Mater reaffirm their friendship Mater becomes a hero and the dastardly plot is foiled in a final fight through London. But there is simply no emotional payoff or punch and you may well end up leaving the movie talking about the mechanics of animation and not the story itself which is awfully preachy at times. You certainly wont get the deep satisfaction that enveloped the end of ""Toy Story 2"" or the warm feeling in the final scenes of ""Wall-E"" and ""Up.""Pixar it seems has become its own worst enemy. It has set such a high bar with what it has done with animation and storytelling over its 25 years that when it falls short -- and it does fall short with ""Cars 2"" -- the disappointment can make a perfectly good entertaining movie seem like a letdown.For any other group of filmmakers this film would be a major achievement. For Pixar its a bump in the road.Cars 2H 1/2 Rating G (good for the whole family)Voice cast Owen Wilson Larry the Cable Guy Michael Caine and Emily MortimerDirector John LasseterRunning time 1 hour 52 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Talend Silicon Valleys latest tech IPO has a strong debutSource Tesla looking at cameras radar in Florida crashCartoons Hillary Clinton makes history Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Its never easy coping with the death of an icon especially for a franchise as intimately associated with that icon as Cars was with Paul Newman. Yet in a shocking miscalculation the usually brilliant folks over at Pixar coped with Newmans death in the stupidest possible way--by transforming John Lasseters shiny love letter to the automobile into an unabashed vehicle for the hayseed comedy stylings of Larry The Cable Guy. Larry The Cable Guys hillbilly tow truck Mater must have sold a lot of toys and played like gangbusters for focus-group respondents because Cars 2 makes the vehicular redneck its proud centerpiece. That leaves Owen Wilson the films ostensible star to fret about the state of his relationship with his best friend Mater. Itchy amp; Scratchy Studios didnt push Poochie on audiences the way Cars 2 does Mater. Cars 2 sends Mater and Wilsons Lightning McQueen on a globe-trotting trek to compete in an international Grand Prix that doubles as a showcase for an amazing new wonder-fuel. In Europe Mater unwittingly lives out the plot of The Man Who Knew Too Little when he gets entangled in a web of intrigue involving a James Bond-style car voiced by Michael Caine and his more-than-capable associate Holley Shiftwell. Yes in Cars 2 Mater even gets the girl. The first Cars was pitched at a much younger audience than the rest of Pixars oeuvre; the sequel is pitched even more directly at an even younger audience. Its difficult to insert scatological humor into a film devoid of human bodily functions but Cars 2 nevertheless manages to smuggle some in via Mater ""leaking fluids"" and at one point ending up in a lavatory truck. Cars 2 is so enraptured with Larry The Cable Guys persona that it even has Mater spout the comedians catchphrases though the more Mater insists something is just funny right there the less funny it becomes. This being Pixar Cars 2 looks fantastic but the studio has never given audiences--especially audiences over the age of 10--less reason to be emotionally invested in the beautiful shiny things flying across the screen. (Preceding the film is a clever short from the Toy Story universe involving Ken and Barbies crudely improvised Hawaiian vacation. This provides an unflattering reminder of what a really good Pixar sequel looks like.)

"Cars 2 review - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Pixar hits the wall with humorless charmless Cars 2Cars 2 a 2 starsJune 23 2011|Michael Phillips | Movie critic""Cars 2"" had every chance to improve upon the leisurely 2006 animated feature from Pixar Animation Studios and Walt Disney Studios. Yet here we are stuck with a merchandising assembly line in lieu of a movie. Despite its technical and design finesse this ranks as Pixars weakest project to date as well as the first from the animation powerhouse that can be described as craven.Twelve films into the life and times of Pixar its clear the ""Cars"" pictures are best assessed as the Disney stockholders pals skewing young and younger the ones that pay for less easily marketed masterworks such as ""Ratatouille"" ""WallE"" and ""Up."" Director John Lasseters sequel smooshes the vehicular ensemble of the first ""Cars"" into a nefarious James Bond universe heavy on the missiles and ray guns and Gatling guns and electrocutions. Sound peculiar? It is peculiar.It is also gabby. For a film so clearly dependent on its racing and chase sequences which have their moments certainly in 3-D ""Cars 2"" never seems to shut up. Yet its virtually joke-free beyond the sort of easy cultural stereotypes that recall the live-action road-rally outings of my youth ""The Great Race"" or lower down the quality pole ""Those Daring Young Men in Their Jaunty Jalopies.""Lightning McQueen once again voiced by Owen Wilson spends much of Ben Queens chaotic screenplay idling in the corner while his Radiator Springs pal Tow Mater (Larry the Cable Guy delivering every line with the exact same cadence) takes the story lead. McQueen competes in three separate World Grand Prix races one in Tokyo one along the Italian Riviera coastline (John Turturro voices McQueens egotistical Italian rival) and the third in London. Meantime Mater -- a good ol boy embarrassment to his friend -- is mistaken for a cunning American secret agent by the Aston Martin superspy Finn McMissile voiced by Michael Caine. McMissile and his field operative Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer) risk their steering columns trying to crack a global conspiracy set up by the ""Thunderball""-like prologue set on a series of petroleum derricks at sea. Here and later the exposition makes the live-action ""Speed Racer"" movie look like a model of streamlined storytelling.The tone and emphasis of ""Cars 2"" veers off course from the start. Too many guns for one thing. The whole thing is too weapons-dependent to be charming. Theres plenty to watch here and preteens who found the first ""Cars"" a bit pokey wont have the same reaction to this frenetic globe-trotting follow-up. But I got little pleasure from seeing these cars (plus boats and a plane) thrown into the spy thriller genre. Its an intriguing story risk at best a protracted stunt at worst. The greatest Pixar films have sampled free-form an unpredictable variety of moods and styles. Here the mash-ups refuse to jell and even Michael Giacchinos score sounds like someone less talented than Michael Giacchino composed it.""Cars 2"" is preceded by a zippy ""Toy Story"" cartoon ""Hawaiian Vacation"" in which Woody and Buzz and friends treat Ken and Barbie to a faux-tropical getaway. In sharp contrast to ""Cars 2"" it reminds you how durable and ingratiating the ""Toy Story"" gang remains well into its franchise.mjphillipstribune.comMPAA rating GVoice cast Owen Wilson (Lightning McQueen); Larry the Cable Guy (Mater); Michael Caine (Finn McMissile); Emily Mortimer (Holley Shiftwell); Bonnie Hunt (Sally); John Turturro (Francesco Bernoulli)Credits Directed by John Lasseter; written by Ben Queen; produced by Denise Ream.

Disney-Pixar ""Cars 2"" (Disney-Pixar) Pixar had never produced a clunker but with ""Cars 2"" the animation studio has not only stalled its gone into reverse.The original ""Cars"" with its anthropomorphic automobiles and sugar-rush race sequences was geared toward a younger audience than Pixar prizewinners such as ""WALL-E"" and ""Up."" Yet the Route 66 sequences had a mature message about community values that was heartfelt and even valiant.Shockingly the sequel takes a 180-degree turn as if the boys who accumulated all the Lightning McQueen merchandise posted a sign saying ""No grown-ups allowed"" while they spitballed the script themselves. At the exit where the first movie stopped to smell the roses this one peddles gluttony and globalism. The premise is that stock-car champion McQueen (voice of Owen Wilson) is goaded into racing overseas against an arrogant Ferrari named Francesco Bernoulli (John Turturro). The event is the World Grand Prix a trio of races in Japan Italy and England sponsored by alternative-fuel manufacturer Sir Miles Axelrod (Eddie Izzard).Naturally McQueens entourage includes most of the characters we remember from the first movie; but instead of finding a useful role for girlfriend Sally (Bonnie Hunt) this juvenile-male fantasy focuses on dimwitted tow truck Mater (Larry the Cable Guy).In Japan Mater makes a fool of himself and is mistaken for an undercover spy by British secret agents Finn McMissile (Michael Caine) and Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer) who are investigating the sabotage of the race cars. Much of the movie is a parody of the James Bond flicks with explosive action sequences and even gunfire something that seems utterly foreign in a Pixar cartoon. The only trace of the family lineage is in the beautiful computer animation. From the candy-color neon of Tokyo to the rocky coastline of the Italian Riviera to the stately landmarks of London the settings are richly detailed and witty.The same cant be said for the script which coasts on the fumes of automotive puns and a wheezy moral about forgiveness. Its hard to forgive co-director and co-writer John Lasseter the Pixar chief executive who built the beloved brand on sophisticated storytelling.

The humor even felt Dreamworks-ish. They had a ""Your Mom"" joke in it for gods sake I thought Pixar was above that Daddy Guysaid on Wednesday June 29 2011 113037 PMI do not agree. I enjoyed this movie as fun light entertainment worthy of the Pixar name. It seems Mr. Roeper cannot fairly evaluate this movie since he simply does not like the idea of talking animated cars. I also thought Mater was a great choice as the main protagonist as he is the most likable character in both movies. Jasonsaid on Monday June 27 2011 111946 PMActually I thought C+ was very generous. I really did not like this movie. The story is really two stories that were not really told well. The first movie was at least about cars... and what cars do best which is to drive/race. Seems like this movie touched on racing and then went off on tangents for the Spy Game story. This movie is probably the worse Pixar Movie yet. You know it is bad when the Toy Story Short is actually better than the entire feature film. J Chrissaid on Sunday June 26 2011 103247 PMI found the lines to be much more childish especially in the beginning. There did seem to be an agenda against big oil and the need for alternative energy. I understand children are the future but this is something that needs to be handled now and handled by adults.

The rusty tow truck Mater (voiced by professional rube Larry the Cable Guy) was desperate to be friends in a semistalkery way. I always assumed that on his return to civilization McQueen (Owen Wilson) would gently detach from needy dopey Mater. Just because the former braggart learned humility on Route 66 didnt mean he had to be a martyr. Somehow thats what Pixars high-gloss thinly premised Cars 2 wants. This globetrotting spy adventure treats the race-car-rube match as a love affair to be nurtured and cherished. After taking Mater to the World Grand Prix in Tokyo McQueen loses his first heat to a flashy Italian (John Turturro) because of one of Maters innocent flights of idiocy. Theres a scolding (""Maybe you should just act a little different"" McQueen says) and a chastened Mater rolls away. (See a TIME Qamp;A with Cars 2 director John Lasseter.) But no one pauses long to pout. Mistaken for an undercover agent by British spy cars Finn McMissile (Michael Caine) and Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer) Mater is whisked off on a mission. An alternative-fuel conspiracy is afoot and an amusing crew of mobsters (Yugos Gremlins Pacers) is out to promote Big Oil. A Pixar movie is always lively and this might be the studios liveliest (and loudest) yet -- but its leanest in terms of warmth and heart. The movie coasts on endless puns and visual gags. Its delight in an alternate reality in which cars go to discos and aim blowtorches at one another is as golly gee whiz as Mater himself. Fitting since this is Maters movie. Its a Materthon. I would call it Materific if he didnt leave me longing for WALLEs robot to crush him into a silent cube. Such is the sincerity of the Pixar vision and the marvel of its visual execution that I feel guilty about this urge. Such is my childs devotion to the franchise that I can hear him saying ""Mommy thats mean. Maters nice."" Well yes he is nice. But friendships must include give and take and the premise of Cars 2 -- that it is a cardinal sin to ask a friend to alter his behavior -- is a lemon. See pictures of great animated movies.

Besides without the great Paul Newman around anymore as the voice of Radiator Springs doctor judge and racing legend Doc Hudson the place was a little too quiet. Thats my theory anyway as to why Cars 2 leaves the town so far behind so quickly for most of this very busy globe-trotting sequel. At some point in the years since champion race car Lightning McQueen (voiced once again by Owen Wilson with his trademark hotdog drawl) settled down in Radiator Springs Cars 2 director John Lasseter got a notion For the follow-up to 2006s Cars hed graft the appeal of the nostalgic American road-trip values and automotive pride established in the first movie onto the foreign-accent high jinks of an international spy caper. Hed get no more kicks from Route 66; hed see the world The resulting sequel is as forced and overloaded as the premise suggests -- a rare display of narrative and tonal struggle on the part of Pixarians famous for their attention to the nuances of story line and character development. But at least Cars 2 looks as expertly sleek and sturdy as audiences have come to expect from the standard-setting animation company which is celebrating its 25th anniversary. Now a celebrity and revved up to snag the title of worlds fastest car Lightning McQueen sets off to race in the World Grand Prix a multicontinent-spanning competition that takes him to Tokyo London and fictional Porto Corsa Italy. McQueen had no plans to include his Radiator Springs helpful-hick friend Mater in his traveling pit crew since Mater is an unsophisticated tow truck with a heart as bulgy as that of human hayseed Kenneth ? the Page on 30 Rock. Still long story short Mater makes the cut. And away from home his accidentally effective made-in-America naivete attracts the attention of the James Bond-ish British spy vehicle Finn McMissile (Michael Caine at the ready) and sidekick Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer) who are on a complicated undercover mission of their own. Convinced that Mater must surely be dumb like an undercover fox rather than just an American idiot they rope him into their spy operation. (Lucky truck he gets to go to Paris too.) McQueen meanwhile runs his races facing off against a world-class Italian rival voiced with full bologna by John Turturro. As an animated cartoon travelogue Cars 2 features the usual sights and cultural differences Tokyo for instance is a welter of neon Hello Kitty sensibility with capsule hotels for cars. (At a buffet reception Mater makes the grabby Western mistake of shoving a mound of sinus-stinging green wasabi horseradish into his grill mistaking it for a free mound of pistachio ice cream.) In Italy families eat-a and dance-a the night away. Im trying hard to forget the scene in which German automotive meanies on the side of the bad guys in the spy portion of all this entertainment round Mater up in a cargo truck and gas him. (To quote Seth Meyers on SNL Really?) Not to get all Dorothy about it but when it comes to Cars theres no place like home. The emotional punch of the original is inextricably rooted in the movies appreciation of off-the-beaten-track America and all that homegrown vintage car culture signifies. Abroad on a tourist visa in Cars 2 Lightning McQueen Mater and the rest of the fleet do their tricks and as responsible corporate citizens of Pixar do them well assisted by the voices of a lot of famous actors. But theyre really just spinning their wheels. B? Check into this and our other highly anticipated summer movies at GetGlue to earn EW Summer Movie stickers.

Cars 2 Fair Directors John Lasseter Brad Lewis. Cast Larry the Cable Guy Owen Wilson Michael Caine. Rating G. This weeks new movie releases Spotlight Michael Caine Disney/Pixar movies Movies about racing ""Cars 2"" proves an exception to that rule. Its sometimes funny often silly but never really transcendent though the same could probably be said of the original as well. Its a race movie as well as a spy caper on wheels and at its heart lies a central mystery Who decided to make Larry the Cable Guy the star? I dont know but his Mater the dopey good-hearted tow truck from the first ""Cars"" is the focus of the sequel which is sort of like basing a fourth ""Toy Story"" on Slinky Dog. The star of ""Witless Protection"" among other delights can only carry a film so far. This time out Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) is goaded with Maters help into entering the World Grand Prix to face the cocky Francesco Bernoulli (John Turturro). The series of three races is both an international competition and a showcase for alternative fuels (yes) put on by Sir Miles Axlerod (Eddie Izzard) a former oil guy er car who has gone green. Lightning decides to take Mater along but his oafish behavior embarrasses Lightning on and off the track which paves the way for a lesson about being yourself and true friendship. But that lesson gets put on the back burner for a time because Mater somehow gets himself involved in international espionage. Someone is trying to sabotage the Grand Prix and spies Finn McMissle (Michael Caine) and Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer) are trying to figure out who and why. Mistaking Mater for a fellow spy - the idiot act is flawless Finn tells him - Mater is soon wearing disguises and working undercover haplessly bumbling his way to success. Youll note that I havent mention Lightning for a while. He disappears from the film in similar fashion for long stretches. This is very much Maters movie so your feelings about Larry the Cable Guys act will go a long way toward coloring your feelings about the film. On the plus side its a great-looking movie. The animation is fantastic particularly during the race sequences and the opening scene a direct nod to James Bond films with Finn involved in an action bit that would make 007 proud. What ""Cars 2"" lacks is that moment the best Pixar films have when parents and children alike stand slack-jawed with awe at something wonderful happening on-screen - when the films move beyond mere entertainment and become something more something better. ""Cars 2"" doesnt have that moment and seems content with merely making us laugh. Perhaps its unfair to expect anything more but for Pixar thats the price of success.

Nonetheless if this shift cant stave off monotony its still welcome as the series at least dispatches with conservative cultural pandering in favor of be-yourself platitudes and--following WALL-Es lead--pro-environment messages all delivered via high-octane chases over land sea and air. Those high-speed pursuits revolve around hot-rod Lightning McQueens (Owen Wilson) participation in a globe-trotting world grand prix during which his redneck tow-truck BFF Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) is mistaken for a spy by a British secret agent (Michael Caine) becoming embroiled in a plot involving outmoded auto ""lemons"" and alternative green fuels. Director John Lasseters 3-D-enhanced animation sparkles but it cant energize centerpieces lacking in suspense and shoving bumbling sidekick Mater--here cast as a Southern-fried Inspector Clouseau--into the spotlight does little to offset the dullness of these cloak-and-dagger machinations. Notwithstanding John Turturros amusingly smug Italian F1 speedster and a few lighthearted jabs at Japanese TV and technology Cars 2 generally remains stuck in neutral.

If ""Cars"" was perhaps the least engaging of Pixars hugely successful animated features John Lasseter and his team have hit the creative accelerator with the unexpectedly delightful ""Cars 2."" The rare sequel that improves on its predecessor this lightning-paced caper-comedy shifts the franchise into high gear with international intrigue spy-movie spoofery and more automotive puns than you can shake a stickshift at handling even its broader stretches with sophistication speed and effortless panache. High-performance B.O. is assured but as with ""Cars"" ancillary/merchandising is where this expertly souped-up entertainment will leave others in the dust. As it recently reaffirmed with ""Toy Story 3"" Pixar never ventures into the bottom-line-driven sequel market without the essentials of a good story and a clear artistic purpose. Working from a whip-smart script by Ben Queen (a relative newcomer with the salient TV credit ""Drive"") Lasseter has not only invigorated his original concept but enabled the viewer to appreciate and share his passion for this unique corner of the Disney toon-iverse. With 2006s ""Cars"" the helmer fashioned a lovely lackadaisical piece of Americana evoking a bygone world of pit stops and open roads inhabited by anthropomorphized automobiles. This time Lasseter abandons Route 66 nostalgia to deliver a giddily escapist action-thriller that moves too swiftly and assuredly for the viewer to do anything but sit back and enjoy the ride. Result may look like a more conventional assembly-line product than its soulful predecessor but ""Cars 2"" is nothing if not personal; not a frame goes by where you cant hear Lasseters inner child squealing with pleasure. The adjustments are clear from the brilliant opening chase sequence in which suave British spy Finn McMissile (voiced by Michael Caine) outguns and outruns the minions of monocle-wearing German scientist Professor Z (Thomas Kretschmann). Its characteristic of the films cleverness that it never winks at the absurdity of enacting such a standard spy-thriller setup with cars; yet that unacknowledged element is what makes the pastiche feel so fresh and witty and the deliriously inventive manner in which the sequence keeps topping itself sets a thrilling pattern for developments to come. But first the story slows down for a quick stopover in Radiator Springs the now-thriving home of Piston Cup-winning racecar Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) and his best friend rusty-brained tow truck Mater (Larry the Cable Guy). When Lightning is invited to compete with arrogant Formula champion Francesco Bernoulli (a hammy John Turturro) in the World Grand Prix he decides to bring Mater along unaware of the trouble the easily distracted socially embarrassing truck will stir up. ""Cars 2"" in fact is really Maters movie expanding the first films friendship-driven themes from the moving perspective of a character whom others are quick to dismiss as a dumb sidekick. The first big setpiece in Tokyo offers marvelous fish-out-of-water comedy as Mater cluelessly chugs his way through this bewildering neon-colored metropolis; he also crosses paths with Finn and fetching associate Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer) who mistake Mater for an American spy. Soon the hapless truck finds himself at the center of an international conspiracy to sabotage the race which is being sponsored by Miles Axlerod (Eddie Izzard) chief proponent of an alternative fuel called Allinol. Super-fast cars cosmopolitan settings sustainable energy -- whats not to love? Critics and columnists should have fun parsing the deeper political messages of ""Cars 2"" which never allows its gas-guzzlers-vs.-hybrids topicality to overpower its exhilarating sense of play. As the film zips from Tokyo to Paris to the Italian Riviera to London Lasseter co-director Brad Lewis and their crack team of animators unleash the sort of wizardly action sequences most live-action directors would envy powered by the brassy James Bond-style riffs of Michael Giacchinos score. Pic allows the viewer to relax into a pleasurable groove even as its abundant in-jokes and peripheral details encourage the mind to stay actively engaged. Set in a world where cars are outfitted with machine guns rockets parachutes holographic displays and in perhaps one innovation too far insta-disguise mechanisms ""Cars 2"" is as close to a pure boys movie as the toon studio has yet made -- though all boys movies should be so universal in appeal. More so than the Pixar norm pic possesses a certain lowbrow streak entirely consistent with its vroom-vroom milieu handily demonstrating that the often-aggravating staples of so much kid-friendly animation -- nonstop banter ethnic accents goofy wordplay (mileage may vary) even bathroom humor -- can be executed with wit and class. Larrys vocal turn lifts Mater to the pantheon of endearing Pixar creations even as he gets occasionally gets on the viewers nerves as he should; with their more elegant diction Caine and Mortimer provide a wonderful contrast as his formidable new allies. Almost every member of the original ""Cars"" gang gets at least a line or two with the poignant exception of Doc Hudson wisely not recast after the death of Paul Newman. Pic will require frame-by-frame DVD scrutiny to fully appreciate the sheer number of creative choices that must have gone into its lensing lighting and production design (informed by live location scouting) though the topnotch 3D treatment makes for an immersive experience best savored on the bigscreen.

Daily Edition Login to download Cars 2 Film Review 1200 AM PDT 6/19/2011 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Disney/Pixar Lightning and Mater mix it up with Formula 1 and spies in yet another Pixar winner. TWITTER Cooler cars and more action follow Lightning and Mater as they mix it up with spies and Formula 1 racers in yet another Pixar winner writes Todd McCarthy. Pixars 2006 release Cars is widely regarded as among the less dazzling of the animation houses dozen sterling titles so its fair to imagine that John Lasseter and his pit crew felt motivated to use a little extra elbow grease in order to deliver an improved new model. On the whole they have as Lightning McQueen and the loyal pick-up truck Mater quickly vamoose from sleepy Radiator Springs to join the Grand Prix circuit in a succession of world capitals where they become entangled in some related international spy intrigue. Featuring cooler cars and more action than Fast Five Cars 2 is notably less refined and more rambunctious than Pixars recent run of artistic gems. But commercially itll be off to the races this summer with even bigger international prospects assured on this lap than on the first spin. No special knowledge or memory of the original is required to get ones bearings as this beautifully designed sequel stands easily on its own four tires. A self-professed car nut from his youth Lasseter takes advantage of the global locations to jam the cast with an auto shows worth of vintage international motorcars from an amply armed Bond-style Aston Martin to the humble East German Trabant; in the bargain he even further adorns Big Ben the Eiffel Tower and in the end credits Pixars own campus to charming effect. Perhaps as much as in any animated film one could cite theres always something beautiful or clever or funny to look at and as often as not to listen to as the anthropomorphized automobiles zip about in high and determined spirits. The story cooked up by Lasseter co-director Brad Lewis and Dan Fogelman and scripted by Ben Queen is both simple and not always entirely discernible on a moment-to-moment basis. At the outset in fact the coordinates are geographically and dramatically inscrutable; physically the action begins literally at sea amidst an ocean of sinister oil rigs infiltrated by British spies Finn McMissile (an Aston Martin voiced by Michael Caine) and Miata-like Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer) who make use of all their special extra-automotive endowments -- wings heavy weaponry underwater capability -- to make a nocturnal escape with their dignity and paint jobs intact. A world away in the American desert the spiffy red Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) is hot-rodding around with tow-truck buddy Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) when hes persuaded to enter an upcoming series of races in which big shot Land Rover Sir Miles Axlerod (Eddie Izzard) hopes to prove the viability of his revolutionary clean fuel Allinol as a substitute for gasoline. Here as elsewhere the visual verbal and musical jokes practically exceed the speed limit; one blink-and-you-miss-it gag shows the marquee of the local drive-in promoting ""The Incredimobiles."" First stop is Tokyo where cars engage in sumo wrestling and the lights of the Ginza district look so bright youre glad for the slight dimming effect of the 3D glasses (Pixar typically amps up the brightness of its images to compensate for the darkening). During a pass through Paris the old Les Halles is wondrously reconstituted as a spare parts bazaar Gusteaus from Ratatouille is part of the cityscape the tops of the Eiffel Tower and the Arch de Triomphe are automotively reimagined and Mater who went home after Tokyo makes a too-soon return. Inoffensive in small doses Maters ""Hee-Haw"" routine gets old pretty quickly and comes to excessively dominate the film with his saddlesore witticisms. Next stop is fictional Porto Corsa an Italian seaside jewel that resembles a theme park version of Monaco. The Italian champion Francesco (John Turturro) intends to assert his dominance over Lightning McQueen here while a disguised Mater tries to infiltrate a gang of low-end Euro cars working on behalf of unknown bosses out to discredit the Allinol vehicles so as to maintain the demand for oil. The message is clear. The in-fighting becomes downright vicious during the final race in London in front of the Queen while the picture itself becomes rather more antic and frantic than it needs to as the ultimate villain is exposed the British spies are vindicated and the Americans while happy in their achievements typically decide that theres no place like home. Even as recent Pixar films have benefited from increased simplicity and modulation of mood and effect Lasseter keeps Cars 2 running at close to the red line from start to finish with nary a pit stop to refuel. On balance its more exhilarating than exhausting but there are moments when sensory overload threatens to set in. More is better seems to be the by-word but a bit less aw-shucks humor and Looney Tunes-like madness over the long haul would have made for a more agreeable balance. The vocal talent assembled for the voices is impressively varied and deep; even for small roles one finds enlisted such estimable actors as Vanessa Redgrave Jason Isaacs Jenifer Lewis Franco Nero Katherine Helmond and Paul Dooley not to mention Cheech Marin Brent Musburger Deadliest Catch star Sig Hansen and race car drivers such as Darrell Waltrip David Hobbs and Jeff Gordon. Michael Giacchinos score has the effect of a super-charger on the film as if it needed one.
