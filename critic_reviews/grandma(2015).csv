""Grandma"" may be technically a relationship rather than a description but we have collectively our assumptions about what the person who occupies that role is like She is probably sweet. She is probably docile. Shed probably really love to bake you some cookies. She is ""Grandma"" and that--not just according to Google but according to movies and novels and comic strips and TV shows across the culture and with very little exception--is her most relevant feature.Not so Grandmas Elle Reid who manages to be both a grandmother and a complicated human at--against all odds--the same time. Elle (Lily Tomlin in a performance that is oddly and tellingly a breakout) is loud and opinionated and stubborn and ornery and angry. (""Mom says that youre philanthropic"" her granddaughter Sage tells her. She quickly corrects herself. ""I mean misanthropic."") A poet who was renowned in the 1970s and who has ridden her success to a life of academia-adjacent bohemianism--Adrienne Rich seems to have been a rough model--Elle is also a resolute feminist who has a first edition of The Feminine Mystique that she actually reads. She is quick with casual insults (""your face looks like an armpit"" she informs a young man who has displeased her) and even quicker with deeper ones. (""You were a footnote"" she spits at her girlfriend Olivia (Judy Greer) while breaking up with her in the first scenes of the film.) And thats largely because a year and a half after her partner of 38 years Violet died of an unnamed illness Elle is also grieving and hurting and lost. The pain--the phantom limb of a lost love--permeates everything she does whether the thing is breaking up with Olivia or coming to terms with long-held family secrets or helping her teenage granddaughter to get an abortion.Related Story Grace and Frankie A New Kind of Divorce Comedy Grandma--written and directed by Paul Weitz whose resume includes such diverse pictures as About a Boy In Good Company Little Fockers and American Pie--follows a single day in the life of Elle her daughter and her granddaughter. Things begin in the morning when Elle is interrupted from the quietly misanthropic day she had planned for herself by Sage--who is 18 and pregnant and desperate to not be--knocking on her door. Her granddaughter (Julia Garner imbuing her character with a subtle wisdom that fits the name) has made an appointment at a nearby abortion clinic. For 545 that evening. Her boyfriend has failed to get the money--630--he had promised to scrounge up to cover the cost of the procedure. Being broke and also hoping to keep her situation a secret from her domineering mother Sage turns to her decidedly non-grandmotherly grandmother for the money and for more general support.The only (well the other) problem? Elle has recently paid off her debts cutting up her credit cards in a symbolic attempt to simplify her life. So she too is broke. But shes also determined to help Sage. And so the two set out on a road trip thats a little bit Terms of Endearment and a little bit Thelma and Louise. They encounter in their quest to gather the 630 before 545 a series of people who double as specters from Elles life--making the whole thing also just a teeny bit Ghosts of Girlfriends Past.Which sounds pretty terrible right plot-wise? Cliched cloying smug forced generally bizarre? And it so easily could have been all of those things. The small miracle of Grandma though is that the film is in the end none of them. Its a character study and morality play and bildungsroman subtly executed and lovingly performed. The characters who could all veer into empty tropes (the aging lesbian the cold career-driven mother the irresponsible teen) pulse in the end with quirky humanity. Theyre given room in the space of a single day to live and breathe and grow. Judy Reid (Marcia Gay Harden) the daughter Elle raised with Violet may be introduced to viewers as an over-caffeinated executive who works at a treadmill desk and goes through assistants as if they were toothbrushes but she grows. Sage may pivot convincingly between adolescent meekness and adolescent arrogance; she too grows. Deciding not to become a mother for her itself confers a kind of maturity.Elle is a resolute feminist who has a first edition of The Feminine Mystique that she actually reads. But the character who grows the most in all this is the one who per the traditional conventions of the pop-cultured Grandma has no growing left to do. This is Elles story her (literal) coming-of-age tale. Grandma indeed insistently disentangles ""age"" from ""maturity"" and that distinction finds Elle with seven decades of living under her belt engaged in stereotypically young-person activities getting a tattoo (from her friend Deathy played by the wonderful Laverne Cox) beating up the kid who got her granddaughter pregnant getting punched in the face by a 5-year-old outside of an abortion clinic. It finds her throwing tantrums and testing her limits and vacillating unpredictably between sweetness and self-absorption. You get the sense that Violet wasnt just Elles partner but a parental influence--stabilizing calming enabling--and that in her absence Elle has reverted to a kind of late-life adolescence. Elle herself is only partially aware of this. ""I like being old"" she muses. ""Young people are stupid.""Elles feminism too is young. Her icons are Betty Friedan and Simone de Beauvoir--she pronounces their names with reverence and love and in Beauvoirs case an exaggeratedly guttural ""r""--and she seems baffled that their iconography could have dissipated in the years between her youth and her granddaughters. ""You dont know The Feminine Mystique?"" Elle asks Sage mystified and horrified. Her granddaughter replies ""Mystique is a character in X-Men.""I wont spoil anything more but its enough to say that the family road trip ends in its way happily. It ends maybe more to the point humanly. Grandma doesnt offer an overt message about the hot-button politics inherent in its plot--about same-sex partnerships about womens reproductive rights about feminism--so much as it offers a gentle appreciation for political ideas as infrastructures of peoples lives. It refuses to judge its characters and it refuses to reduce them to caricature. Elle is a lesbian; that is not all she is. She is a poet; that is not all she is. She is a feminist; that is not all she is. She is a senior; that is not all she is.And she is yes a grandmother. That too is not all.

Twitter Email previous10 Questions for President Obama About Iran nextThe Normalization of Iran Another View From Israel Most Popular Presented by Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Gary Cameron / Reuters Trump Time Capsule 62 A Man Who Can Be Baited With a Tweet James Fallows None Last night in her overall very successful acceptance speech Hillary Clinton said with ruthless precision about her opponent Ask yourself Does Donald Trump have the temperament to be Commander-in-Chief? Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride. Continue Reading Tom Pennington / Getty Images The Mind of Donald Trump Dan P. McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

At the end of 2013 in the low-slung industrial Taiwanese city of Kaohsiung a bevy of officials came to attend the ribbon cutting of a huge former hotel that had undergone a top-to-bottom multimillion-dollar renovation. Speaking before the throngs of celebrants who blocked the flow of traffic Taiwans deputy director of the Ministry of the Interior praised the group that funded the renovation and presented them for the 10th year straight with the national ""Excellent Religious Group"" award. ""For years you have dedicated your time and lives to anti-drug work and human- rights dissemination"" said the director echoing praise offered by the mayors office and the presidents national-policy adviser.

Graham A federal appeals court finds the impact of the states voting law can only be explained by ""discriminatory intent."" Updated on July 29 at 930 p.m. DURHAM N.C.--The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down key portions of North Carolinas strict 2013 voting law on Friday delivering a stern rebuke to the states Republican General Assembly and Governor Pat McCrory. The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting. ""In what comes as close to a smoking gun as we are likely to see in modern times the States very justification for a challenged statute hinges explicitly on race--specifically its concern that African Americans who had overwhelmingly voted for Democrats had too much access to the franchise"" wrote Judge Diana Gribbon Motz. Continue Reading Mark Kauzlarich / Reuters How Chelsea Beat Ivanka at Being a Candidate Daughter Michelle Cottle The comparatively less flashy less spirited former First Kid managed to show her moms softer side at the DNC on Thursday. Yes yes yes. Chelsea Clinton is not the most charismatic orator--as the Twittersphere was happy to point out during her brief address on Thursday night. She is like her mother that way. Theres something not quite natural about her self-presentation. Shes not stilted exactly. But she can come across as too cautious too reserved too conscious of other peoples eyes upon her. But lets face it as the lead-in to Hillarys big nominating speech a little bit of boring was called for. Unlike some of this conventions high-wattage speakers there was zero chance Chelsea was going to upstage Hillary with a barnburner or tear-jerker. Chelsea wasnt there to pump up the crowd. Her role was to comfort to explain to cajole with an eye toward giving Americans a glimpse of her mothers softer side. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion. Continue Reading Charles Mostoller / Reuters Can Personality Be Changed? Scott Barry Kaufman Psychologists have long debated how flexible someones ""true"" self is. Almost everyone has something they want to change about their personality. In 2014 a study that traced peoples goals for personality change found that the vast majority of its subjects wanted to be more extraverted agreeable emotionally stable and open to new experiences. A whopping 97 percent said they wished they were more conscientious. These desires appeared to be rooted in dissatisfaction. People wanted to become more extraverted if they werent happy with their sex lives hobbies or friendships. They wanted to become more conscientious if they were displeased with their finances or schoolwork. The findings reflect the social psychologist Roy Baumeisters notion of ""crystallization of discontent"" Once people begin to recognize larger patterns of shortcomings in their lives he contends they may reshuffle their core values and priorities to justify improving things. Continue Reading Channel 4 The Prescience of Brass Eye 15 Years Later David Sims Chris Morriss brutal satire aired its last and most controversial episode in 2001 but its skewering of the news media feels more relevant than ever. A sex offender is thrown in the stocks presented with a small child and asked if he wants to molest him. A mob of protestors is thrown a ""dummy full of guts"" that is stomped to pieces within seconds. A radio host insists that pedophiles have ""more genes in common with crabs"" than the rest of humanity insisting ""Theres no real evidence for [that] but it is scientific fact."" Its hard to pinpoint the most cringe-inducing moment on ""Paedogeddon"" a special episode of the British TV satire Brass Eye. But 15 years after the episode aired it remains a totemic terrifying satirical vision. Few comedies since have dared to cross the boundaries of taste with such impunity. ""Paedogeddon"" aired in the U.K. in the summer of 2001 a year after the murder of a young girl had sparked national hysteria over the countrys sex-offender registry. Britains most-read newspaper led a campaign to publish the names and locations of all 110000 convicted sex offenders prompting a riot in which an angry mob ransacked the home of an ex-con. Brass Eye a parody of a 60 Minutes-like newsmagazine show had been dormant after airing one season in the UK in 1997. But it returned four years later for this surprise broadcast one that saw its furious (fictional) anchors barking from a dark studio about the plague of seemingly super-powered child molesters stalking the nation holding a funhouse mirror up to the climate of paranoia and fear that had built up around the country. It was a bold wildly insensitive piece of comedy but one that captured the growing madness of the 24-hour news media and foreshadowed some uglier aspects of its future. Continue Reading AP/The Atlantic What ISIS Really Wants Graeme Wood The Islamic State is no mere collection of psychopaths. It is a religious group with carefully considered beliefs among them that it is a key agent of the coming apocalypse. Heres what that means for its strategy--and for how to stop it. What is the Islamic State? Where did it come from and what are its intentions? The simplicity of these questions can be deceiving and few Western leaders seem to know the answers. In December The New York Times published confidential comments by Major General Michael K. Nagata the Special Operations commander for the United States in the Middle East admitting that he had hardly begun figuring out the Islamic States appeal. ""We have not defeated the idea"" he said. ""We do not even understand the idea."" In the past year President Obama has referred to the Islamic State variously as ""not Islamic"" and as al-Qaedas ""jayvee team"" statements that reflected confusion about the group and may have contributed to significant strategic errors.

Photo Aaron Epstein MOVIE REVIEW Grandma Running time 80 minutes. Rated R (profanity drugs). Legend Lily Tomlin -- who hasnt had a lead role in a movie since 1988s ""Big Business"" -- gives the performance of her career at age 75 in Paul Weitzs ""Grandma"" as an acerbic lesbian poet on a mission. First seen coldly dismissing her much-younger lover of four months Olivia (Judy Greer) as a ""footnote Tomlins Elle reveals a well-hidden warmth when her granddaughter Sage (Julia Garner of TVs ""The Americans) shows up with an urgent request for 600. Sage 18 wants to abort a pregnancy -- something her pro-choice Grandma an ardent feminist thinks would be an excellent idea under the circumstances though she stresses it will be a choice that Sage will have to live with for the rest of her life. But the semiretired and once-famous Elle who has worked as a writer-in-residence at various colleges doesnt have the money. And shes just shredded all her credit cards to celebrate getting out of debt. So Grandma and Sage set out in the balky 1955 Dodge Royal that belonged to Elles late longtime partner (in real life its owned by Tomlin) to raise the money in less than eight hours because Sage wont be able to get another appointment for an abortion for weeks. Along the way Grandma uses a hockey stick on the loutish boyfriend (Nat Wolff) who has gotten Sage pregnant but that yields only a pittance. Elle also verbally abuses a bookstore owner (the late Elizabeth Pena) who wont pay what Grandma thinks a first-edition copies of ""The Feminist Mystique and other feminist bibles are worth. Elle also turns her wrath on a barista (John Cho) who takes exception when Elle loudly complains to his customers that his coffee shop used to be a free abortion clinic. Tomlin is hilariously misanthropic in all of these scenes snapping (as only she can) to someone who asks why Elle stopped writing that ""people stopped reading. But shes on better behavior with a transsexual tattoo artist (a nice cameo by Laverne Cox of ""Orange is the New Black) who sympathizes with Sages plight but isnt in a position to repay a debt to Elle on the spot. Writer-director Weitz (who co-helmed ""American Pie and ""About a Boy with his brother Chris) gradually steers Elle and the film from comedy into potent dramatic territory. That reaches its full flourish during a fund-raising visit to Karl (Sam Elliott) a handsome older gentleman who played an important role in Elles very distant past. This sequence lasts less than 15 minutes but its positively heartbreaking in its intensity. Tomlin and Elliot revisit their characters pain and anger over long-ago events with such commitment that they could very well both end up with Oscar nominations. The final stop on the way to the clinic is one both Grandma and Sage would prefer to avoid -- breaking news of the pregnancy to Sages high-strung businesswoman mom Judy (Marcia Gay Harden). Even the feisty Elle (who conceived Judy with a sperm donor) finds Judy -- who barks out orders to underlings from a standing desk mounted on a treadmill -- frightening. ""Grandma is extremely well-acted full of delightful surprises and effectively the pro-choice ""Juno. With not a wasted frame in its taut 80 minutes this is deserving of your attention as one of the years best movies even if its being released in the middle of August.

(Sony Pictures Classics) Article Tweet Change text size for the story Print this story Report an error Grandma 4.0 stars Starring Lily Tomlin Marcia Gay Harden Sam Elliott Julia Garner Directed by Paul Weitz Written by Paul Weitz Duration 80 minutes Id like to be Lily Tomlin when I grow up. Tomlin is all razor-sharp wit and zero B.S. in Grandma a wonderful film from Paul Weitz (Little Fockers) about three generations of women in the same family. Its tempting to speculate that Tomlins character here is but a lightly embroidered version of the actress herself. Tomlin stars as Elle an acerbic poet and academic of about 70. Elle is a lesbian and an outspoken feminist and she doesnt suffer fools gladly. Shes still capable of wonder of course but what she mostly marvels at is the stupidity of the general populace. As Grandma opens Elle is breaking up with her much-younger girlfriend (Judy Greer); our sarcastic poet has never quite got over the love of her life a woman named Violet. Elle is obviously still in mourning for her late partner. Elles teenaged granddaughter turns up at her house one morning. Sage (Julia Garner) is pregnant and has decided to have an abortion but she doesnt have the 600 necessary for the procedure. Sage doesnt want to go to her perfectionist mother Judy (Marcia Gay Harden). Elle is likewise intimidated by Judy her only child ""Ive been afraid of your mom since she was five years old"" Elle tells Sage. Watch the trailer for Grandma The two women go on the road to find the money. They stop at a cafe that used to be a free clinic -- Elle is shocked by the current cost of an abortion -- and move on to visit Sages boyfriend (Nat Wolff). He doesnt come out of the meeting with grandma very well. Then theres a visit to a hip cafe where Elle intends to sell her first editions of Betty Friedan and Simone De Beauvoirs books; filmmaker Weitz captures an entire generation gap in one quick exchange between Sage and Grandma that features The Feminine Mystique and X-Men in a cultural head-on collision. Later in the story comes Elles visit with Karl (Sam Elliott) a guy from her distant past. These two veterans revisit their mutual history in a few minutes of screen time thatll slap you right back in your theatre chair -- this bit alone is worth the price of admission. For all that the subject matter makes Grandma appear to be hugely political its really a story about the passage of time and the various roads not taken in life -- and how that all looks from a perspective of 50 years. The movie is both hysterically funny and heartbreaking but Weitz somehow makes you laugh without making light of serious issues. Its interesting to see in the same week how two different filmmakers handle vaguely similar subject matter involving age generational differences and the war between men and women. The fluffy Hollywood version is available in Nancy Meyers film The Intern which seems to suggest a genial patriarchy is feminisms best hope. Hmm ... The sharp brilliant insightful take -- all terrific writing and performances -- is on offer in Grandma. Decisions decisions.

"Mini reviews of Grandma Unbranded Mississippi Grind Hellions Listen to Me Marlon | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesMini reviews of Grandma Unbranded Mississippi Grind Hellions Listen to Me MarlonQuick takes on some of this weeks new releases. Chloe Rose and Robert Patrick take aim at a pumpkin-headed creation in Hellions.The documentary Listen to Me Marlon opens on Friday.  (Courtesy of Abramorama)  Unbranded follows a cross-country journey.  (Cory Richards)  Lily Tomlin is the title character in Grandma.  (Sony Pictures Classics)  Ryan Reynolds stars in Mississipi Grind.By Linda BarnardStaff Reporter and Bruce DeMaraEntertainment and Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Sept. 24 2015UnbrandedDocumentary directed by Phillip Baribeau. 105 minutes. Opens Friday at Bloor Hot Docs Cinema VOD same day. STCWinner of the Audience Award at Hot Docs 2015 Phillip Baribeaus visually stunning documentary Unbranded follows four recent Texas Aamp;M grads who hope riding mustangs from Mexico to Canada will make a point about how to save the wild horses.After all if they can train 16 of the some 50000 unwanted animals (including a few burros) held in government pens awaiting adoption and prove their worth perhaps others will follow suit. Article Continued BelowThe horses surprise even their champions taking to their gruelling task with more heart than anyone imagined. Its the likeable but somewhat naive twenty-something guys who have some lessons to learn on their 5000-kilometre quest.The scenery is gorgeous especially in the Grand Canyon while echoes of Western mythology and cowboy lore forged by John Ford and Zane Grey are often present. The riders come to the end of the trip changed -- not always for the better. And while there is an unwelcome surprise ahead theres also wisdom. Like this remember when your horse needs a buddy to ease him along the road you cant do better than a wilful little burro.Linda BarnardGrandmaStarring Lily Tomlin Marcia Gay Harden. Written and directed by Paul Weitz. 79 minutes. Opens Friday at the Varsity. 14ALily Tomlin plays Elle a lesbian poet currently in straitened financial circumstances who finds herself in a bind when granddaughter Sage shows up unexpectedly and in desperate need of 600 to pay for an abortion and with the appointment set only a few hours to come up with the cash.That leads to an eventful daylong road trip in Elles old clunker visiting old haunts and old friends and lovers -- both male and female -- in search of a short-term loan. If only it were that simple. Or rather if only Elle was a sweeter person whod be willing to put on a happy face. Fat chance.One remarkable thing is how casually the film deals with the issue of abortion in a country where even now it remains such a hot-button issue and no Republican candidate for U.S. president can hope to win the nomination with pro-choice views.Tomlins performance as the irascible but compassionate Elle is superb even as one wonders if the role isnt much of a stretch from Tomlin herself. Toss in some lovely great supporting performances especially Marcia Gay Harden as Judy -- as the scrappy mom caught between mother and daughter -- and youve got a film that is both funny and unexpectedly moving. Bruce DeMara Mississippi GrindStarring Ben Mendelsohn Ryan Reynolds. Written and directed by Anna Boden Ryan Fleck. Opens Friday at TIFF Bell Lightbox VOD same day. 108 minutes. STCAustralian actor Ben Mendelsohn plays Gerry a down-in-out gambling addict whos hoping his luck will change when he encounters a friendly stranger Curtis (Ryan Reynolds). It had better since he owes money to Sam (Alfre Woodard) and despite a beatific smile her patience in wearing thin.""Some guys are born to lose"" Gerry observes but Curtis with his fast talk and swagger seems like something of a good-luck charm. Starting in Dubuque Iowa the two head south along the Mississippi River stopping in St. Louis Memphis and Little Rock on their way to New Orleans where Gerry hopes to cash in big at a poker tournament. For Gerry its the ultimate gamble but suffice to say not everything goes according to plan.Mendelsohn and Reynolds share great screen chemistry although its never clear whats motivating Reynolds character Curtis to go along for the ride which makes their partnership all the more intriguing.The script by directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck is loaded with great dialogue and an assortment of seedy characters. The filmmakers also create a mood that alternates between desperation and hope as the unlikely duo wend their way southward.The ending is both unexpected and satisfying. Bruce DeMaraHellionsStarring Chloe Rose Robert Patrick Rossif Sutherland and Luke Bilyk. Directed by Bruce McDonald. Opens Friday at Cineplex Yonge amp; Dundas. 82 mins. 14ATrick-or-treaters are out but whos really at the door in Bruce McDonalds Halloween spooker? Pregnant teen Dora (Chloe Rose) must fight to survive the night in her own home which happens to be in a small town that takes the day of pumpkins and ghouls very seriously. Perhaps too seriously.Theres not much that could top the shock from Chloes doc (Rossif Sutherland) that shes four weeks pregnant something neither she nor her boyfriend (Luke Bilyk) were planning on. But nightfall cometh.While her mother (Rachel Wilson) and little brother (Peter DaCunha) go out in quest of shellouts Dora is left at home to deal with her psychic demons -- and also some kid-sized real ones who keeping banging at the door chanting and demanding. Dont expect the town sheriff (Robert Patrick) to know whats going on.The reality vs. insanity script by Pascal Trottier (The Colony) knock-knocks with effective dread but its at odds with McDonalds shotgun approach to horror visuals something he didnt need for his superior fright flick Pontypool. The Toronto filmmakers use of digital infrared lensing for most of the film sounds cool in theory but on the screen the pinkish glow makes it seems as if cinematographer Norayr Kasper bought expired celluloid.Some of the horror tropes being played with here -- Rosemarys Baby is a clear touchstone -- are staying up way past their bedtime.Peter HowellListen to Me MarlonWritten and directed by Stevan Riley. Opens Friday at TIFF Bell Lightbox. 95 minutes. STCMarlon Brando in his own words. Biopic about great actors are a dime a dozen. But Stevan Rileys opus to one of the most legendary thespians of modern times has something others dont; access to hundreds of hours of private audio recordings by Brando that Riley cannily uses to tell the story of the two-time Oscar winners charmed and turbulent life. Theres also a digitized hologram created by Brando himself that Riley uses to startlingly eerie effect.Theres plenty of archival photos of the young Brando and footage from his films (including a stinker or two) that helps us to understand his troubled youth with an alcoholic mother he loved dearly and a brutal alcoholic father he despised and a career that soared sunk and then soared again.The film also touches on Brandos activism on behalf of the environment and Native Americans. It looks at the troubled lives of his two children Christian who went to jail for shooting his half-sister Cheyennes abusive boyfriend and Cheyenne who later committed suicide.But it is Brandos own words that mesmerize throughout as he undergoes a lifelong existential struggle to understand his own purpose.It makes for a fascinating and extraordinary journey.Bruce DeMaraThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

EntertainmentMovies Grandma a road-trip showcase for Lily Tomlin Originally published September 17 2015 at 300 pm Updated September 22 2015 at 1101 am Lily Tomlin as Elle foreground goes on a road trip with her granddaughter Sage played by Julia Garner in ""Grandma."" A quirky road movie thats a comedy with moments of wrenching drama led by the great Lily Tomlin. Rated 31/2 stars out of 4. Lincoln Square Guild 45th. Share story By Moira Macdonald Seattle Times movie critic Short tart yet unexpectedly sweet Paul Weitzs ""Grandma"" is a small-scale character study -- and because that character is played by the great Lily Tomlin its mesmerizing right up until its final frame. Tomlin who has an uncanny way of making her characters all of a piece (the same low wry voice; the same fierce squint; the same funny twist of a line like squeezing a lemon) and yet utterly distinctive plays Elle Reid a California poet and failed academic whos having a pretty bad day. First thing in the morning she cruelly breaks up with her much-younger lover Olivia (Judy Greer); calling her ""a footnote."" Then after sobbing in the shower (we know immediately these tears arent for Olivia) Elles 18-year-old granddaughter Sage (a terrific Julia Garner) shows up at the door needing 600 before the end of the day for an abortion. As the film progresses ""Grandma"" becomes a road movie with Elle and Sage visiting various people in their lives in the hope of scrounging up the money. (Elle who just paid off all her bills cant give it to Sage as shes cut up her credit cards and made a wind chime out of them. ""Im transmogrifying my life into art"" she says in gruff self-mocking.) And we learn along the way that Elles still in desperately sad mourning for her longtime partner Violet who died a year and a half ago; that Elle never hesitates to speak her mind no matter who might get hurt along the way; that shes estranged from her businesswoman daughter Judy (Marcia Gay Harden) for a number of complicated reasons; and that Elle loves her granddaughter deeply though she wouldnt dream of saying it. Its a comedy but there are moments of wrenching drama most notably with Sam Elliott as a flame from long ago whos never forgiven Elle -- or forgotten her. (He also in this films quirky fashion greets Elle and Sage with a breezy ""Want some zucchini?"") But this is Tomlins movie -- Weitz wrote the character of Elle for her -- and its a rare pleasure to watch her front and center telling a story with every line. This woman is a misanthrope and revels in it; but watch how Tomlin through a touch on the back a microscopic smile a look of quiet regret makes Elle something richer and more complicated. By the end she hasnt become any nicer but shes made a few things a little more right and shes laughed -- and we laugh with her. Movie Review 1/2   Grandma with Lily Tomlin Julia Garner Marcia Gay Harden Judy Greer Laverne Cox Sam Elliott Nat Wolff. Written and directed by Paul Weitz. 80 minutes.

As the film opens Elle is gruffly dumping her recent much younger girlfriend (Judy Greer) telling her she amounts to nothing more than a footnote in her life.Then Elles teenage granddaughter Sage (Julia Garner) drops by. Shes pregnant and needs 630 for an abortion she has scheduled later in the day. Elle who recently cut up her credit cards in some show of political independence only has about 40 cash.So Elle and Julia set out in Elles old car to find some cash. Which is pretty much the entire movie as writer-director Paul Weitz (""About a Boy"") steers Elle through a series of encounters with acquaintances old and new each revealing more about the cantankerous poet.Theres a stop by a tattoo parlor where a transgender friend (Laverne Cox) owes Elle some money; she ends up with a free tattoo and a little cash. Theres a visit to the guy (Nat Wolff) who impregnated Sage; he ends up moaning on the floor. Theres a misguided attempt to sell some ragged first-edition books Elle thinks are valuable.And theres a powerful scene in which Elle visits an old friend (a superb Sam Elliott) who turns out to be much more than that. In the end Elle and Sage are forced to face Sages mother (Marcia Gay Harden) and the family dynamic becomes clear.Through it all Tomlin is worn and wearying storming through scenes and then sagging only to storm again. Its a touching real and intimate performance that lingers in the mind and heart.tlongdetroitnews.comtwitter.com/toomuchTomLongGrandmaGRADE B+Rated R for language and some drug useRunning time 79 minutes 130 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1F0o3q2 MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2015/09/11/movie-review-tom-long-lily-tomlin-shines-complex-cantankerous-grandma/72042420/,200,grandma(2015)6,grandma(2015),detroitnews
"Grandma (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Grandma (R) Lily Tomlin is the main attraction in this slight but engrossing comedy about a prickly grandmother on a mission. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezmiamiherald.com9/10/2015 Editor rating 2.5 Grandma is a modest old-fashioned star vehicle built to show off the talents of and pay warm homage to a veteran movie star. Paul Weitz (About a Boy The Golden Compass The Twilight Saga New Moon) wrote and directed the movie specifically for Lily Tomlin who is playing a fictional character intended to reflect well-known personal and professional facets of her life Her penchant for balancing poignant drama with acidic comedy her intelligence her feminism and her long relationship with the writer-producer Jane Wagner (theyve been a couple since the early 1970s). The only thing Tomlin doesnt get to do in Grandma is sing. She plays Elle a prickly 70-something who has just dumped her much-younger girlfriend (Judy Greer) with a preemptive strike of cruelty. ""Youre a footnote"" Elle snaps at her trying to hurt her partner bad enough to make her leave although the way Tomlin delivers the line we immediately know she doesnt mean it. Elle is a poet and academic who hasnt written much since the death of her former girlfriend (they had been together for 38 years). Shes paid off her home cut up her credit cards and rid herself of all financial debt. Shes digging in to spend her autumn years alone and in mourning with no emotional attachments. Then her teenage granddaughter Sage (Julia Garner) shows up at her door one morning revealing shes pregnant and needs help paying for the abortion shes scheduled to have later that afternoon. Except Elle only has 48 and a clunky old car to her name. So the pair sets out on a quest to raise the modest sum by a variety of means Collecting an old debt from an old friend a transgender tattoo artist (Laverne Cox from Orange Is the New Black); selling first editions of feminist books to a lesbian coffee shop owner (the late Elizabeth Pena); dropping in on her ex-husband (Sam Elliott) who is still smarting from their breakup but just might still be harboring enough affection to help her out. Episodic by design Grandma moves along from one encounter to the next like a slim novel comprised of chapters (Marcia Gay Harden plays Elles still-bitter estranged daughter). Tying the film together is Tomlin who spouts lines that are self-reflective (""I was marginally well-known 40 years ago."") or born out of personal experience (""I like being old. Young people are stupid.""). The movie is slight and at 75 minutes without end credits barely qualifies as a feature-length film. But Tomlin is a wonder the embodiment of a woman who has lived a full life experienced triumphs and suffered great losses and isnt at all melancholy or remorseful as she slides into her golden  years. ""Thats the way it goes"" Elle says about getting old. Its not ideal but theres nothing you can do except embrace it. Cast Lily Tomlin Julia Garner Marcia Gay Harden Judy Greer Sam Elliott Laverne Cox Elizabeth Pena. Writer-director Paul Weitz. A Sony Pictures Classics release. Running time 79 minutes.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Dont let that comforting title fool you. ""Grandma"" is no sugary-sweet smoothie for viewers of a certain AARP age. It would hit that target audience like a hurled brick. Instead it hands Lily Tomlin the first leading role she has played since the 80s reveling in every drop of the sharp-tongued sarcasm this consummate comedic actor conveys like no one else. Bland it is not. The word ""Grandma"" has barely faded from the opening visual when Tomlins irascible Elle Reid shows shes no fountain of senior citizen wisdom and warm hugs. A retired Los Angeles college professor who embodies the activist feminism of the 60s she likes her privacy even when she gets a surprise visit from her 18-year-old granddaughter Sage (Julia Garner). Sage and her dope-head boyfriend have been bumbling in the sack. The high school girls pregnancy tester has revealed shes with child. She knows that her mom Elles all-controlling Type A daughter Judy (Marcia Gay Harden) a product of the career-woman mind-set of the 80s wont give Sage the 600 she needs that very afternoon to end her condition. When Elle learns of Sages situation does she soothe her with cuddles? No she growls condescendingly that its ""nothing to dance a jig about."" On the other hand its not the sort of thing a self-confident specialist in feminist poetry sees as the taboo end of the world. If Elles daughter wont help her own kid she will. Sure she doesnt have a dollar to spare out of her miniature pension but where theres a will there are five or 10 ways. Maybe the womens bookstore nearby would give her a premium price for her first edition of Betty Friedans ""The Feminine Mystique"" which is she must inform Sage a pioneering feminist bestseller not a character from Marvels X-Men. Climbing into a rattletrap Dodge she inherited from her late lesbian partner combative Elle takes her offsprings offspring on a daylong pilgrimage around Los Angeles. Their trip is part adventure part womens history lesson and part treasure hunt each segment stuffed with sharp character insights and barbed humor. In a trim 82 minutes writer/director Paul Weitz (""About a Boy"") has created an edgy sophisticated comedy that fits his star like a designer gown. And he has brought in a marvelous supporting cast. There are superb contributions by Judy Greer (as an ex-girlfriend glum because Elle dropped her after just four months) Sam Elliott (as Elles only male lover still regretting their identical split-up after she misled him decades ago to give her the gestation she wanted) and Nat Wolff (as Sages baby daddy who Elle lambastes with a hockey stick). In each new turn of the plot Elle reveals herself as an equal-opportunity misanthrope as ready to attack women or men strangers or relations. Grandma 1/2 out of 4 stars Rating R for language and some drug use. Theater Uptown. And yet its hard to direct the characters sneers back at her. Tomlins wisecracking firebrand has an admirable streak of self-criticism. Elle begins every argument with a faint smile that says ""This is going to be fun."" She sums up her own bridge-burning history by declaring ""Yeah well Im a horrible person"" in the same tough-as-nails tone as she uses against everyone else. An awful person played by a terrific actress with pure pizazz in a film worthy of her gifts.

Lily Tomlin is an offbeat matriarch in Grandma By Calvin Wilson St. Louis Post-Dispatch Calvin Wilson Sep 10 2015 (...) Sony Pictures Classics Julia Garner (left) and Lily Tomlin in ""Grandma."" Elle (Lily Tomlin) isnt the first person who would come to mind when one envisions a grandmother. Shes not sweet and shes not exactly adorable though some might find her outspokenness charming. Yet when it comes to her granddaughter Sage (Julia Garner) shes capable of a surprising vulnerability.That much is clear when Sage turns up at Elles home with a pressing problem Shes made an appointment to get an abortion but she doesnt have the necessary cash. Elle a feminist poet who at one time was in vogue among the literary elite is as nonjudgmental as Sage had hoped. The problem is Grandma is strapped for cash. And the appointment is just hours away.So she and Sage take to the road with the goal of getting a loan. Along the way they encounter some of the key people from Elles past. Among them is Olivia (Judy Greer) who until recently was her girlfriend and hasnt quite gotten over the breakup and Karl (Sam Elliott) who offers to lend the money until he learns information that proves to be a deal-breaker. Then theres Sages workaholic mom Judy (Marcia Gay Harden) who seems to have designed her life as a repudiation of Elles.Written and directed by Paul Weitz (""Being Flynn"") ""Grandma"" is an ideal showcase for Tomlin who brings to the film a winning blend of contrariness and effervescence. Her performance deftly balances Elles complexities resulting in a portrait of a woman who may have a multitude of regrets but just cant help but be who she is. As Sage Garner is a perfect foil for Tomlin. And Elliott makes the most of a role that along with his recent turn in ""Ill See You in My Dreams"" may signal a career renaissance. ""Grandma"" is a small film but one with huge things to say about the meaning of family and the value of living on ones own terms.What ""Grandma""  Three stars out of four  Run time 120  Rating R  Content Language drug use  Calvin Wilson  314-340-8346calvinwilsonstl on Twittercalvinwilsonpost-dispatch.com Tags Grandma Lily Tomin Calvin Wilson St. Louis Post-dispatch Calvin Wilson Calvin Wilson is an arts writer for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

Elle breaks up with a new much younger girlfriend named Olivia (Judy Greer) but her uncreative solitude is disturbed by the arrival of her teen-age granddaughter Sage (Julia Garner) who is pregnant and has an appointment for an abortion that very day but no money to pay for it. Neither does Elle who as a result packs Sage into her old car and goes on a local odyssey through her circle of acquaintances past and present in quest of the funds. The tightly constructed small-scale comic drama written and directed by Paul Weitz puts Elle face to face with a lifetime of bittersweet memories involving the transgender tattoo artist Deathy (Laverne Cox) and Karl (Sam Elliott) the man whom Elle left when she came out as a lesbian. But Weitz leaches the tough situations of emotional difficulty; the sentimental drama is a superhero movie for liberals. Elles faux crustiness gleams with her heart of gold and the movies heroes and villains line up as obviously as in a blockbuster.      --Richard Brody Goings On A free New York City events app What to do tonight Follow goingson About Us FAQ Strongbox Customer Care Cartoon Bank On The Town RSS Contact Us The New Yorker Store Careers Reprints/Permissions Press The New Yorker Media Kit Conde Nast Digital Subscribe to a magazine View All Titles - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Allure Architectural Digest Bon Appetit Brides Conde Nast Traveler Details Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ Lucky Self Teen Vogue The New Yorker Vanity Fair Vogue W Wired Other Conde Nast sites - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Allure Architectural Digest Ars Technica Bon Appetit Brides.com Conde Nast Traveler Concierge Details Epicurious Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ Hotel Chatter Jaunted Lucky NutritionData Reddit The Scene Self Style Teen Vogue Vanity Fair Vegas Chatter Vogue W Wired Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement (effective January 1 2014) and Privacy Policy (effective January 1 2014).

Randy Cordova The Republic | azcentral.com 248 p.m. MST August 28 2015Uneven comedy-drama about a poet (Lily Tomlin) and her granddaughter (Julia Garner) searching for cash to fund the teens abortion. Tomlin acts up a storm in the hit-or-miss film.Lily Tomlin is an acerbic misanthrope an unlikely source of comfort for her pregnant granddaughter in ""Grandma.""(Photo Sony Pictures Classics)Story HighlightsCritics review 3.5 stars out of 5Elle Reid the protagonist of ""Grandma"" is an unfiltered poet and teacher who confronts life with a ferocity that often overrides her common sense. Shes played by Lily Tomlin and its hard to imagine another actress in the role.Some reservations come with that statement. At times Elle feels more like a collection of Tomlins greatest hits than a character. The tics the mannerisms the feistiness? It all seems familiar glimpsed in such varied projects as ""Grace and Frankie"" ""Nine to Five"" ""Malibu Country"" and ""Admission."" The latter was directed by Paul Weitz who writes and directs ""Grandma"" and he apparently tailored this role very specifically for Tomlins quirky talents.Viewers first encounter Elle as she is ending a four-month relationship with a much younger lover Olivia (Judy Greer). ""Youre a footnote"" she snarls at Olivia and its a smart shorthand that tells you that (A) Elle can be cruel; and (B) shes still grieving the loss of her longtime partner who we later learn has died.Elle quickly gets a visit from her granddaughter Sage (Julia Garner from TVs ""The Americans""). The teen is pregnant and needs 600 for an abortion. In a convenient plot device Elle had cut up her credit cards in a rage and turned them into wind chimes. The two wind up hitting the road looking for cash.In addition to the lousy ""Admission"" Weitz resume veers from junk like ""Little Fockers"" and ""American Pie"" to the excellent ""About a Boy."" Perhaps indicative of his uneven filmography ""Grandma"" also is a tad schizophrenic. There is dumb unfunny physical comedy such as Elle getting punched by a little girl or angrily assaulting Sages boyfriend. Other bits simply feel off Elle is annoyed that Sage isnt familiar with Betty Friedan but how many teenagers are?AZCENTRALGrandma (2015) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsThose scenes absolutely dont work but then comes a wrenching moment in which Elle hits up an old boyfriend (Sam Elliott) for the money. Tomlin dials it down and the scene is electric as layers of regret pain and affection are all quickly peeled away. Its subtle and heartbreaking (Elliott should be remembered come award season) and shows how good the movie can be.Most of the time though ""Grandma"" cruises at a middle ground that is neither great nor terrible. The acting is uniformly fine -- Greer is terrific and the wonderful Elizabeth Pena gives one of her last performances as a cafe owner. But the film lacks the consistency to be truly memorable.Reach the reporter at randy.cordovaarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8849.

Lily Tomlin has always been an old soul playing characters either too world-weary to open up (Robert Altmans extraordinary Nashville) or too precocious to care (tyke Edith Ann in her comedy routines). By any measure Tomlin should be killing it right now since the growl of her voice has kept her young. Grandma gives her a promising role built out of feisty habits verbal showdowns and a sneaky sense of compassion--movingly projected toward her Angeleno characters granddaughter Sage (Julia Garner) who shows up in desperate need of an abortion. The plot is as simple as that as Elle (Tomlin) yanks the kid toward her ancient Dodge and the two of them take off in search of scraped-together funds and you already sense a little tough love. Director Paul Weitzs original story wobbles though between satisfying moments of Elles lefty defiance (shes shocked that Sage knows X-Mens Mystique but not The Feminine Mystique) and gestures that are depressingly obvious Of course Sages brusque lawyer mom (Marcia Gay Harden) works at a treadmill desk and berates her assistant. The movie presents Sages predicament matter-of-factly and thats to be applauded but the family dysfunction is way too easily resolved. Would that Grandma had given rascally Sam Elliott more time to express his magnificent unease as Elles old flame still wounded by her own choices. Single-handedly he saves the film from its cutesy instincts.

Comments Grandma Recommended Video Rated R  78 minutes  2015 The pistol-packin granny has been a comedy archetype for years but it turns out to be the role of a lifetime for Lily Tomlin whose tour de force performance lights up this well-written escapade by Paul Weitz (About a Boy). Her character Elle Reid is an irascible poet whose straight marriage ended long ago and whose more recent romance with an academic colleague (Judy Greer) she terminates in the movies raw opening scene. Shortly thereafter Elles school-age granddaughter (Julia Garner) comes to her needing money for an abortion and the pair set off on a comic odyssey involving both Elles former lover (Sam Elliott) and the girls mother (Marcia Gay Harden) who has hard feelings for Elle. The three generations of women are all nicely drawn but this is Tomlins show--her acerbic Elle ranks with Ernestine and Edith Ann among her greatest characters. By J.R.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it Elle (Lily Tomlin) receives a surprising visit from granddaughter Sage (Julia Garner) in ""Grandma."" (Glen Wilson/Sony Pictures Classics) By Ann Hornaday August 27 2015 Follow AnnHornaday Lily Tomlin -- comedian activist national treasure and natural wonder -- deftly balances a dazzling star turn and deeply felt character study in ""Grandma."" Like its unassuming title this small closely observed movie is deceptively modest in scope and tone. Tomlin plays Elle Reid a feminist poet and retired college professor whose comfortably secluded life is momentarily upended by a visit from her granddaughter Sage (Julia Garner). The 18-year-old has discovered that shes pregnant and she has an appointment for a termination later that day. But the girls mother recently confiscated her credit card. Sage needs 600 by the afternoon and her grandmother is the only friend she can turn to. ""Grandma"" follows the two women as they call on friends and acquaintances throughout Los Angeles a classic journey made all the more schematic by the fact that theyre traveling in a vintage Dodge once owned by Elles late partner Violet. Still mired in the spiky angry slough of grief Elle refuses to give Sage any cuddly reassurance in the face of her plight. ""Its nothing to dance a jig about"" she snaps when Sage seeks a comforting word. Later when she takes her granddaughter to a free womens health care clinic only to discover its become an upscale cafe she goes into a coffee-spilling tirade. ""Where can you get a reasonably priced abortion these days?"" she barks angrily. Although reproductive choice is one theme of ""Grandma"" this is not an abortion comedy in the tradition of ""Citizen Ruth"" or ""Obvious Child."" Rather in the sensitive hands of writer- director Paul Weitz it becomes a wry even melancholy meditation on aging self-knowledge and acceptance. Theres an amusing subtext having to do with the morphology of feminism over the past 40 years When Elle tries to sell a first-edition Betty Friedan book at a womens bookstore Sage thinks ""The Feminine Mystique"" is a character from the X-Men. But the clue to the movies core meaning can be found in its very first scene when Elle is breaking up with her much younger girlfriend Olivia (Judy Greer). After an impressively literary shouting match (""Solipsist"" ""Writer-in-residence"") Elle confesses ""Yeah well Im a horrible person."" Its a sarcastic remark but a telling one that becomes fully explained in a shattering scene when Elle visits a mysterious man from her past named Karl played with laconic soulfulness by Sam Elliott. Up until this point ""Grandma"" has been a funny somewhat bittersweet tour through Elles anger and prickly resignation. But when Tomlin and Elliott talk over a shared joint an entire world opens up and ""Grandma"" takes on unexpected emotional depth and force. As definitive scenes go its right up there with the greats a delicate finally devastating two-hander that holds its own as a one-act play or short film with a lifetime of rue and regret culminating in a moment of utter heartbreak and contained fury. Just when you think ""Grandma"" can never match that energy it does when Marcia Gay Harden delivers just as assured and nuanced a performance as Sages mother and Elles daughter Judy. As well served as she is by her supporting players though theres no question that Tomlin owns ""Grandma"" as she was meant to. Weitz wrote it for her after she appeared in his 2013 dramedy ""Admission."" Like all of her greatest creations Tomlin brings Elle to life with compassion and candid sometimes withering knowingness. Weitz begins his movie with an epigram from the poet Eileen Myles ""Time passes / Thats for sure."" Tomlin embodies that difficult damnable truth with a sharp tongue and sharper elbows that only she could pull off and still be unquestionably lovable. Weitz has done Tomlin her fans and the viewing public an enormous service reminding us all that the woman weve come to think of fondly as Ernestine and Edith Anne is also the superbly expressive actress of ""Nashville"" ""The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe"" and from now on ""Grandma.""

"Grandma review Modern family - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Grandma review Lily Tomlin shines in story of modern family Grandma Sony Pictures Classics Lily Tomlin plays a cranky LA poet helping her granddaughter in Paul Weitzs slight effective picture. Lily Tomlin plays a cranky LA poet helping her granddaughter in Paul Weitzs slight effective picture. (Sony Pictures Classics) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune A slip of a movie but Lily Tomlin leads a pip of a cast. We dont get to choose when or where we fall in love with a performer; sometimes it happens when theyre doing Ingmar Bergman and sometimes its ""Rowan amp; Martins Laugh-In."" Lily Tomlin joined the cast of that cherished relic of a sketch comedy TV show in 1970 and very quickly millions became her comedy slaves thanks to Ernestine her purse-lipped telephone operator and to Edith Ann the fidgety wonder of a 5-year-old in the oversize rocking chair.In short order Tomlin now 75 shone in more dramatic roles on the big screen particularly in Robert Altmans ""Nashville"" and Robert Bentons ""The Late Show."" Lately in a pretty good variety of series television she has brought a sort of natural eccentric charisma to all sorts of roles. Shes having a robust third act. So few actresses get the chance. Tomlins comic and dramatic resources are mined for all theyre worth in writer-director Paul Weitzs ""Grandma."" Its very slight and very short (barely 75 minutes minus the end credits) but the material is just effective and affecting enough to make up for its own schematic quality. Its a matter of watching a series of actors led by Tomlin tag off on their respective scenes.Weitz divides his story of an enormously prickly Los Angeles poet named Elle Reid into vignettes with titles such as ""Ink"" and ""Ogre."" Elles lover of 38 years has been dead for a year or so and her latest girlfriend Olivia (Judy Greer honest and sharp) has borne the brunt of Elles residual hostility and grief. The movie begins with their breakup followed by a visit paid to Elle by granddaughter Sage (Julia Garner). The high school senior needs 630 for an abortion and shes too scared to ask her own fearsome mother (Marcia Gay Harden). Weitzs film unfolds in a single eventful day as Elle and Sage search out whats left of Elles circle of friends. Weitz strips everything down for efficiency in ""Grandma."" The writing is relentlessly on point and often lacks breathing room but some films settle for being workable showcases for their interpreters. When Sam Elliotts Karl shows up as an old flame of Elles the stage is set for scenes we may well see highlighted early next year on Oscar night if Tomlin and Elliott get the nominations they deserve. In just a few minutes Weitzs script affords Elliott an unusually wide emotional range as old resentments and wounds are exposed and Tomlins character acknowledges the damage she did decades ago simply by not being honest -- with him or with herself. Its the films highlight. Check out the latest movie reviews from Michael Phillips and the Chicago Tribune. The audience-baiting material falls to Tomlins character as she goes from confronting Sages loser sometime boyfriend (Nat Wolff in a bluntly written joke of a role) to making uneasy amends with her own daughter. The least predictable laugh in ""Grandma"" takes place outside the family planning clinic just after Elle lectures a very young anti-abortion protester. The truest revelation of character comes earlier in a private moment after Elle has just ejected Olivia from her insular life. Elles in the bathroom looking at herself in the mirror and she lets loose with a growl of regret anger and teary laughter all in one nonverbal flourish. It may well have been scripted but Tomlin makes it her own. The movie would be far less without such moments.Michael Phillips is a Tribune critic.mjphillipstribpub.com Twitter phillipstribune ""Grandma"" -- Three starsMPAA rating R (for language and some drug use) Grandma (Trailer) Grandma is about the relationship between a grandmother and her granddaughter in a funny situation.

Courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics Lily Tomlin portrays Elle a grief-stricken woman who finds her way in ""Grandma."" Courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics Photo Courtesy Of Sony Pictures Classi Tomlin gives tour de force performance in Grandma 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Lily Tomlin has been one of our best comedic actresses for the past 50 years and shes at the height of her powers in the beautifully observed dramedy ""Grandma."" Her performance is funny acerbic touching -- and ultimately exhilarating. When we first meet Elle a poet who reached her creative zenith during the flower child days she is dumping her new younger girlfriend Olivia (Judy Greer very good) brutally calling her a ""footnote"" to the 38-year relationship that she had with her late lover. No sooner has she shown Olivia the door than Elle throws herself a pity party dressing up in her old graduation robe and sorting through mementos. But her wallowing in grief gets interrupted with a knock at the door Its her sweet yet unfocused granddaughter Sage (Julia Garner excellent) who needs 600 for an abortion. So begins a somewhat contrived road trip for cash (Elle conveniently tore up all her credit cards and she has no savings) but theres nothing contrived about the characters who will inhabit Elles world on this day. At first writer-director Paul Weitz (""About a Boy"") lulls us into thinking that his film will be a series of broad comedy sketches as Elle acts up at a coffee shop and then confronts Sages loser boyfriend Cam (Nat Wolff hilarious). These bits are amusing but Weitz has much more on his mind as Elle will have to face the mistakes of her past during visits to an old hetero flame and to her estranged daughter. There is no one better than Tomlin in conveying a deadpan weariness at the absurdity of life yet at the same time embracing life all the while avoiding cheap sentiment and making us laugh. Weitz in a script clearly written for Tomlin has given her the best role of her career -- and she runs with it. Yet ""Grandma"" is not just a star vehicle. Tomlin gets plenty of help with an excellent ensemble cast that includes John Cho (as an unhip cafe owner) Laverne Cox (as a reliable yet broke friend) and the late Elizabeth Pena (as a lesbian pal whos no shrinking violet herself). Even the most minor of characters makes an impression. But the film really soars when an increasingly desperate Elle pays a house call to gruff good old boy Karl (Sam Elliott astounding) the man she dumped years ago as cruelly as she did Olivia earlier that day. Analyzing this scene would be giving too much away but its a complex skillfully executed encounter as Tomlin and Elliott spar on a sublime scale. Its glorious. Not to be outdone Marcia Gay Harden soon enters the picture as Elles distant and high-strung daughter Judy. Both Elle and Sage see Judy as a last resort and for good reason. Though like all of Weitzs characters here Judy is much more complicated than we first think. As usual Harden shines and its a hoot to see these three generations of women -- Elle Judy and Sage -- on the same canvas. ""Grandma"" handles the abortion issue in a low-key manner though the films feminist undercurrent is unmistakable and organic to both the humor and the drama of the story. However this is a movie about dealing with grief and finding our place in the world when it seems to have passed us by. As Elle utters her trademark laugh in the final frames we know that she has done exactly that. David Lewis is a Bay Area writer. Grandma Dramedy. Written and directed by Paul Weitz.

"Small(er) Movie Roundup Lily Tomlin-Jennifer Aniston Comic Genius Edition << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Small(er) Movie Roundup Lily Tomlin-Jennifer Aniston Comic Genius Edition Sundance Institute Movies August 26 2015 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Grandma directed by Paul Weitz The difference between this comedy actually working and being disposable comes entirely from the delicacy intuition and professional wisdom thats gone into making it. The story seems like more of the kind of myopic gimmicky family dysfunction thats infected lots of midtier American independent moviemaking in the last 20 years from Pieces of April to Little Miss Sunshine to Winters Bone. A pregnant teenager named Sage (Julia Garner) looking for money to have an abortion drops in on Elle (Lily Tomlin) her cantankerous lesbian-feminist-poet grandmother. They spend the hours before the appointment scouring Los Angeles for 630 in Elles ancient Dodge Royal. Momentarily broke Elle shakes down Sages belligerent boyfriend (Nat Wolff) old friends (Laverne Cox the late Elizabeth Pena) and her ex-husband (Sam Elliott). They run into the former student (Judy Greer) whom Elles just dumped and evicted and eventually have no choice but to pay a visit to Sages mother (Marcia Gay Harden) another of Elles estrangements. Weitz wrote this movie and he isnt content to knock out a mediocre sitcom. Theres life in the mapping of the situation and easy calibration in the engineering of the comedy. After 20 minutes his 80-minute road movie opens into an emotional odyssey with Tomlin blowing hot and cold all over that map. Her partner of a zillion years died not long ago so theres that. But even when things are good this woman seems like an armadillo dry and brittle and a little nuts. The community health clinic Elle remembers is now a cafe run by John Cho that serves coffee she thinks is terrible. She says so dumps coffee on the floor and curses the existence of the shop as though it were built on sacred land. Her righteousness is obnoxious to the people around her but Tomlin pitches it so that the performance never gets on your nerves. Shes insulting one minute warm the next. Tomlins face is strangely smooth now -- its lost its range of expression. But that alto voice and sense of timing are still powerful comedic tools. She has a laugh line here -- ""Oh boy. She does not need an espresso"" -- thats witheringly deadpan and so tossed off but in her delivery you can hear decades of skill. For us its a hilariously punctual observation. For her its another free throw. Elles quest seems very much in keeping with what your grandmother would do for you -- were your grandmother a tattooed stoned Betty Friedan acolyte anyway. Her sniping and tirades are done in the desperate service of love. The ease of the writing hits a snag in the last two scenes but there even the actors -- namely Greer and Judy Geeson as her mother -- erase the elements of the story that are hard to believe. This and Danny Collins and Welcome to Me are the three comedies from this year that have great subtle lived-in acting in which none of the cast is scared of being too loud or manic or insane. In Grandma the actors are using the same playbook to do different things so that even people who have a single scene -- or if youre Colleen Camp begging for your plate at Penas feminist coffee shop just two or three lines -- get to be funny human unexpectedly moving. This is especially true of Elliott who might never have been more emotionally supple (or sexier) than he is in 10 or so minutes here. (He was pretty good too with more screen time with Blythe Danner in Ill See You in My Dreams which is basically AARP porn and on FXs Justified. The man is having a year.) But the best thing here is Harden who gets the most strongly written part with the highest degree of difficulty. She has two scenes to hit a dozen notes without tipping the movie over into melodrama (she can be shameless when allowed). Given the financial urgency youre expecting a very different woman from the one before whom Elle and Sage have dragged themselves. Its not worth ruining the surprise of who she is. Basically these are comfortable women who have grown uncomfortable with each other and perhaps themselves. Harden and the movie go so far in the opposite direction of where youd expect a story like this would go that its breathtaking watching them discover a way to surprise you. The movies called Grandma but Harden expands the scope to include her conflation of motherhood and daughterdom too. Lionsgate Shes Funny That Way directed by Peter Bogdanovich The entire time I was with this sad limp stale arthritic bag of cliches I kept thinking Im surprised its not worse. It opens with Imogen Poots as a starlet named Isabella Patterson being interviewed by a skeptical journalist (Illeana Douglas) and Poots whos English speaks in one of those stomach-roiling Noo Yawk accents about Bogie and Bacall and how the oldies are better than the crap currently on TV. ""Who needs to watch shows on teenage pregnancy and people in a house screaming at each other? In my neighborhood that was called Wednesday."" And at my house Wednesday is Mr. Robot night so suck it Izzy. But the reason I didnt give up is probably the same reason Owen Wilson Will Forte Kathryn Hahn Jennifer Aniston and more than half a dozen other people including Michael Shannon and Quentin Tarantino agreed to appear in this movie Bogdanovich. Were all deluding ourselves. He left his best stuff in the 1970s. But were rooting for him while hes still rooting around. What hes come up with this time is early-to-mid-2000s Woody Allen (Poots seems made up to evoke Scarlett Johansson which just makes you think that Johansson said no). Wilson is a theater director whose thing in bed is delivering one line of dialogue from Ernst Lubitschs Cluny Brown and paying call girls tens of thousands of dollars to stay off the market after they slept with him. Izzy was a recent purchase who happens also to be an actress and to be auditioning for his latest show which also stars Wilsons wife (Hahn) who had an affair with the leading man (Rhys Ifans). Meanwhile the plays author (Forte) has a thing for Izzy whose therapist (Aniston) is his girlfriend. This is a shrink farce stuffed inside a boudoir farce stuffed inside a backstage screwball comedy -- think the Marx Brothers at a department store with a broken elevator. The whole movie is tantrums and meltdowns and pitiful nostalgia -- at some point even for Bogdanovichs own fine performance as Dr. Melfis therapist on The Sopranos. And yet every once in a while something funny will happen. Lucy Punch will show up as an untraceably accented dingbat escort or Hahn will hit the roof. The movie is up to about a half-dozen things and Bogdanovich -- who wrote this with his ex-wife Louise Stratten -- lacks the dexterity to get it going. But what youre reminded of yet again is that Aniston is one of the great screen comedians. Shes in the bright sexy Goldie Hawn mode but can gather clouds faster and more convincingly than Hawn. Good directors must know this. Most of her scenes here are extraneous but her vulgarity and tartness are so sharp that the movie needs them. She and Austin Pendleton as a patient also obsessed with Izzy have one good scene together in her office. He asks her out and her response (""What kind of food do you eat?"") is a lightning strike. That line is followed with something vulgar and its hilarious too. This isnt just Aniston having the best stuff (theres no ""best"" here). Its her having the most fun with her talent. Unlike Bogdanovich she can multitask doing about six things in one close-up with a few lines. Shes funny in every way. Focus Features Sinister 2 directed by Ciaran Foy There comes a point when you have to say no to these horror sequels. Theres no skill or idea visible anywhere just the sound of money being sucked from your pockets -- and because noise design is the genres strongest suit now the sucking sounds like a million bucks. The original movie from 2012 was haunted-house horror with an out-there-ish performance by Ethan Hawke and a sick immoral twist He was a true-crime writer who moves his family into a house he suspects is possessed. The filmmakers didnt know what to do with that moral problem so it just become Diet Shining but even that wasnt so bad. This time the sheriffs deputy from that movie (James Ransone) has been trying to stop more of these cursed-house killings by burning them down. Hes happened upon one that he cant destroy because its occupied by a woman (Shannyn Sossamon) and her two sons and they cant leave because theyre on the run from her abusive husband. One boy (Robert Daniel Sloan) is jealous that the ghosts of dead children show Super 8 movies of their respective familys grisly ritual murders to his brother (Dartanian Sloan) and not to him so he beats him up to get their attention. Their bogeyman master (a dude with long hair and no mouth) needs one of the brothers to kill their family. Its not reality youre looking for with a movie like this. Its terror tension primacy and hopefully some internal logic. This one the latest to fall off the producer Jason Blums near-weekly assembly line just picks through recent trends -- found footage handheld panic parental dysfunction -- and throws them against the wall. It gets off on evil kids played by actors directed for maximum brattiness. (Are there no timeouts in hell?) The son who calls his mother the ""c"" isnt even possessed -- hes just a psycho-bully. And Sossamon is stuck playing one of the dumbest characters Ive ever seen in this sort of film a free-spirited furniture restorer who lacks the strength and wit to stay gone from her husband and has the insouciance to come on to Ransones deputy who appears to be truly trying to get them out of this horror house. When one of the actors playing her sons curses her out all she can say is ""Go to your room."" Whereupon the movie goes from horror to fantasy for most black audiences Go to your room? For real lady? But Ransone has a natural worried air in these movies. This one is almost worth watching for what paltry bits of acting and cleverness hes allowed to play. As for the kidss Super 8 films which of them is paying composers tomandandy for their knockoff Trent Reznor soundtrack? There is something fascinatingly despicable about the pleasure the children get in watching people watch them commit murder and I cant wait for a psychology graduate student to unpack that narcissism and wed it to an abuse narrative. This feels like a job for a director who knows how to conflate domestic tragedy with bedtime nightmares the way say Jennifer Kent did with last years The Babadook. That persons not making this movie. The original films director Scott Derrickson is off making a Dr. Strange movie for Marvel Studios (both Sinister scripts are credited to him and C. Robert Cargill). This means the duty of concocting bogus excuses for us to jump out of our seats falls to Foy. But even the last gotcha shot here -- in which our bogeyman actually bends over just to stick his head into the frame -- feels like a cry for help. Thats this movie -- not horror but a bunch of photobombs.

"Review Lily Tomlin gives bittersweet performance in Grandma - Mercury News Entertainment Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Lily Tomlin gives bittersweet performance in GrandmaBy Jocelyn NoveckAssociated Press Posted 08/25/2015 054606 PM PDTUpdated 08/26/2015 030511 PM PDTA movie about a wisecracking grandma and her teen granddaughter racing around in a beat-up car to find 600 by nightfall. ... You might think that sounds like any number of mediocre road comedies full of trite generational gags that lead to a sappy all-is-forgiven ending. Youd be very wrong. ""Grandma"" is a brisk moving bittersweet film that displays the singular talents of Lily Tomlin -- especially her ability to fuse acerbic and cranky with empathetic and sincere and to find an essential lovableness at the core of a superficially unlikable person.The film opens today in San Francisco and throughout the rest of the Bay Area Sept. 4. Directed and written for Tomlin by Paul Weitz it also deals with abortion a theme that easily could have taken over every line and frame of the film. But somehow Weitzs treatment of the subject leaves us thinking even more about what it means to be someones mother someones daughter someones granddaughter -- and what it means to grow old. Credit for that last part goes to Tomlin and Sam Elliott who darned near steals the show as her old lover Karl in a scene with Tomlin that could be shown in acting classes to demonstrate how much two actors can convey in just a few minutes about a lifelong relationship.Advertisement Tomlin plays Elle a brilliant poet and professor who perhaps due to her facility with words doesnt mince them. We meet Elle in her living room while shes breaking up with a younger girlfriend (Judy Greer). ""You were a footnote"" Elle tells her lover with more resigned honesty than spite. But later alone in her shower she weeps. We soon learn that Elle is still suffering from the loss of her longtime romantic partner Violet which explains much of her bitterness. She is also clearly at odds with her stressed workaholic daughter Judy (a pitch-perfect Marcia Gay Harden). But when teen granddaughter Sage (Julia Garner appealingly natural) comes knocking Elles ready to help.Sage needs an abortion and fast. The only open appointment time is that evening and the cost is 600 -- which gets Elle ranting about it being impossible to get a reasonably priced abortion these days.Sage has no money but wants to avoid bringing her judgmental mother into the picture. Elle herself is barely scraping by on a college writer-in-residence gig. Shes recently paid off her debt and cut her credit cards into scraps that now serve as wind chimes.Elle is also angry -- as we see in a funny mini-breakdown she has in a coffee shop -- but not at Sage. First shes angry at Sages obnoxious good-for-nothing boyfriend who has no intention of contributing to the abortion until Elle pretty much beats him physically into submission and grabs the few dollars he has. They also try Elles old friend Deathy (Laverne Cox of ""Orange Is the New Black"") a tattoo artist who can offer only a free tattoo. Elle has one more idea Karl an old flame. She shows up on his doorstep and at first it seems hell be an easy solution. But then the layers of the onion get peeled back. Karls laconic demeanor and sexy drawl make it all the more shocking when his rage resentment and more come gushing forth. Of course Judy (Harden) eventually must emerge and shes a trip She works at a treadmill desk and has espresso running through her veins. But Judy isnt the shrew she initially seems. In one of the better scenes the three generations of women come together for a moment in which it becomes clear that even in the nuttiest families there are bonds that supersede all the craziness. We wont spoil the story but in the end just Elle is on the screen as she should be. Tomlin. Operating full throttle at 75 she deserves that final solo shot.Grandma    Rating R for language and some drug useCast Lily Tomlin Julia Garner Marcia Gay Harden Sam Elliott Judy Greer Writer/director Paul WeitzRunning time 1 hour 19 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

Photo Sony Pictures Classics Grandma written and directed by Paul Weitz is both a pedestal to Lily Tomlin -- who finally gets to play a gay woman -- and an elegy for figures of the feminist and gay-rights eras who still dont quite fit in even in places like California. Its protagonist Elle Reid (Tomlin) is a sour abrasive and deeply unhappy woman a poet whom no one reads anymore and who has little contact with her daughter or other old friends. In part thats because shes still in mourning for her partner of more than three decades (the nice one of the pair apparently). But its also because she makes colorful scenes wherever she goes. In the opening she purges herself of Olivia (Judy Greer) her lover of four months hissing that the young woman was nothing but a ""footnote."" (Olivia ""Thats a horrible thing to say."" Elle ""Well Im a horrible person."") Elle is pulling away from the world. When her teenage granddaughter Sage (Julia Garner) shows up at her door needing money for an abortion Elle explains that she has just paid off all her debts and turned her credit cards (""they infantilize you"") into mobiles. But Sages appointment is late that afternoon and so Grandma takes it upon herself to drive around and find the cash. Though its loaded with laugh lines Grandma is saturated in melancholy and an irreversible sense of loss. Its as if Weitz -- director of American Pie and Little Fockers among other slapstick comedies -- has finally decided to let his bleak flag fly. The film has a modest unfussed-over feel and a sense of place thats at once familiar and alienating Even a homey lesbian cafe-bookstore can turn suddenly cold. Elle has lived her life her way not only marching to her own tune but helping to write it. And now shes a near-tragic figure. Tomlin has certainly earned Weitzs pedestal and its fun to watch her charge into places shes not welcome and rattle off insults in her distinctive croak -- her timing is killer. But a lot of the part is one-note and her face is a bit of a mask. Tomlins genius has always been for mixing tones -- anxious exuberant hopeful dashed -- in ways that you could never predict. But even Elles moments of vulnerability are predictable. Its a very schematic movie. Schematic but heartfelt -- and full of wonderful moments. Theres a crowd-pleasing scene in which Tomlin incinerates the feckless punk (Nat Wolff) who knocked Sage up. (""Your face looks like an armpit."") The delightful Judy Greer at last gets a decent movie part though its little but tremulousness and tears. (A scene in which Elle meets Olivias parents is deliciously awkward.) Weitzs tone is just right for the late scenes in the clinic sad but resolute. Grandmas dramatic high point is a scene that features Sam Elliott as Karl who lives on a ranch amid the mountains and once featured prominently in Elles life. Elliott rarely gets a chance to show something underneath the movies most charismatic basso drawl and his final notes of grief are something to behold. He still has surprises in him. The studio thats releasing Grandma is sponsoring the NPR morning program on my local station this week and it was odd to hear its description of the film. I didnt get it down word for word but the gist is that Tomlin -- the announcer says -- plays a woman who drives around seeing old friends and dredging up secrets from her past while trying to raise 600 for her granddaughter. What was left out was every single hot-button element--that she plays a widowed lesbian who drives around seeing old friends -- among them the three-decades-younger female lover she just dumped -- while trying to raise 600 for her pregnant underage granddaughter to have an abortion. The NPR timorousness (born of fears of incurring the wrath of people who dont actually listen to NPR but love denouncing it to their elected officials) is in splendid contrast to the matter-of-fact treatment of the movie itself. All those hot buttons are touched lightly the way they are in the world that exists beyond the Duggars the Republican primary and in pockets of the country where four-times-married county officials refuse to marry gays because their lifestyle runs counter to the Christian Bible. Whatever else Grandma marks a new era in gay cinema -- ones that confident and mature enough to acknowledge regret.

She is a proud feminist. She is a once-famous now mostly forgotten poet. She is a lesbian. She is someone who does not take any nonsense from anyone. But to Sage shes something else. Shes ""Grandma."" And so when the teenager gets into the sort of trouble she cant easily confess to a parent she goes to her grandparent. And Elle as she always has quickly jumps into the fray. ""Grandma"" a purposefully modest character study from Paul Weitz (but more the Weitz who made ""About a Boy"" than the Weitz who made ""American Pie"") is a little bit of a road movie a little bit of a pro-choice drama and more than a little slight. But mostly its a great role for Lily Tomlin as Elle. Shes not working in a vacuum here. Shes surrounded by terrific actresses - Marcia Gay Harden as her adult daughter the wonderful Judy Greer as her much-younger (ex-)lover. There are quick bits by Laverne Cox and the late lamented Elizabeth Pena. And theres also a marvelous turn by Sam Elliot who shows up - in what turns out to be the heart of the film - as the one heterosexual experience Elle had in a moment of weakness. (If youre going to have any moment of weakness Elliots probably the one to have it with.) Hes fine - raw wounded and angry - and his scene with Tomlin is electric. But this is - even despite the deft co-starring work of young Julia Garner as Sage - Tomlins movie. And she brings real ornery life to Elle a woman whos so convinced the world is out to get her shes determined to get it first - and so barrels through every day ready for a fight (and sometimes finding it in unexpected places.) Its a great portrait although sometimes it feels a little broadly drawn - if Elle were really always as brusquely insulting as shes portrayed here its hard to believe she would have managed to make it to this age let alone still have at least a few people willing to talk to her. Weitz shows us glimpses of her tenderness. It would have been good to see more. Tomlin however who hasnt had a part like this in years is wonderful as this aging warrior. And whenever Weitz goes a little soft - the script getting too obviously anecdotal the soundtrack too studiously endearing - she tries to bring things back regarding the latest idiocy she has to deal with through narrowed eyes wasting as little of her breath as possible on the new moron whos just cropped up in her path. ""Grandma"" isnt a movie for audiences looking for group hugs or pat endings. But if you want a real picture of an intimidating uncompromising and sometimes unbearable woman - and a chance to see a veteran actress bring her to life - its a good place to start. Ratings note The film contains strong language brief violence and substance abuse. Grandma (R) Sony Pictures Classics (80 min.) Directed by Paul Weitz.

"Review With Lily Tomlin leading the way Grandma grows into a meaningful journey - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review With Lily Tomlin leading the way Grandma grows into a meaningful journey Review With Lily Tomlin leading the way Grandma grows into a meaningful journey Sony Pictures Classics Julia Garner as Sage seeking an abortion sparks a road trip into the past and present with Lily Tomlin as her grandmother Elle. Julia Garner as Sage seeking an abortion sparks a road trip into the past and present with Lily Tomlin as her grandmother Elle. (Sony Pictures Classics) Michael Sragow As fearless cantankerous poet Elle Reid Lily Tomlin explains to her teenage granddaughter Sage (the luminous Julia Garner) why she sliced up her credit cards and turned the pieces into wind chimes ""Im transmogrifying my life into art"" Elle quips airily.Tomlins casualness makes the moment classic. She has a genius for embodying tough individuals incisively without fuss or sentimentality. ------------For the record 215 p.m. Aug. 21 2015 An earlier version of this post misstated actress Judy Greers first name as Julie. ------------The chance to see Tomlin in a starring role is the prime attraction of ""Grandma"" a dizzyingly uneven comedy-drama written and directed by Paul Weitz (""About a Boy"" ""In Good Company""). For too long this film renders a portrait of a feminist artist in clown paint though Tomlin hangs in with a veracious multidimensional performance. Indie Focus podcast Paul Weitz shares the story of how Lily Tomlin inspired him write and direct GrandmaOpen link SIGN UP for the free Indie Focus movies newsletter gt;gt;""Grandma"" pivots on Sages search for 600 to fund an abortion. She knocks on Elles door at 9 a.m. hoping she can borrow the money and avoid coming clean with her forbidding mother (Marcia Gay Harden). Sages 545 p.m. appointment at an outpatient clinic provides some ticking-clock suspense and Elles lack of cash sets up a road trip that doubles as an obstacle course in a 1955 Dodge Royal -- the car that belonged to Elles longtime lover Violet who died a year and a half ago. Only one award away from being a member of the exclusive EGOT club Lily Tomlins showbiz legacy runs from ""Rowan and Martins Laugh-In"" through her work with Robert Altman to Netflixs new hit ""Grace and Frankie"" and the upcoming film ""Grandma."" Take a look at her award-winning career here. Early on the action feels overcalculated and under-felt. During Elles acid breakup with her younger lover Olivia (Judy Greer) Elle says that their four-month affair was ""a footnote"" compared with her 38-year relationship with Violet.Such vignettes pigeonhole Elle as a lethal putdown artist. It may be fun to see Elle level Sages feckless ex-boyfriend (Nat Wolff) who represents everything that went wrong with the sexual revolution. But the laughs are cheap. He and other characters pop up and go down like figures in a midway shooting gallery easy targets for Elles righteous sarcasm. They include a brittle coffee-shop owner (John Cho) who caters to ""Ozzie and Harriet"" clientele on the former site of a womens free health center and a no-nonsense lesbian cafe owner (the late Elizabeth Pena) who bristles at paying Elle exorbitant prices for worn first editions of feminist classics.The film U-turns halfway through when Elle visits a much-married grandparent named Karl (Sam Elliott) who glints with curiosity and wit and has a bloodhounds nose for truth. Their history emerges in a mini-marvel of emotional compression. Irreverent humor about Karls patriarchal status -- ""Im biblical"" he proclaims in Elliotts deep dry crackling tones -- gives way to an avalanche of secrets and lies.Elliott imbues Karl with slyness and urgency. Hes initially disarming then heartbreaking as he discovers why Elle needs the money. Tomlin proves how much stronger a stringent heroine can be when forced to face her existential stumbles. In this duet of equals they explore the confusion that surrounds an unbalanced marriage an ill-planned abortion and the emergence of sexual identity. That scene provokes arguments that cant be resolved with a wisecrack.Elle who lived before Roe vs. Wade ponders Sages choices -- and her own -- in an abortion clinic. Tomlin is marvelous as a rueful self-awareness seeps into her characters angry eyes. Her granddaughters neediness forges a rapprochement between Tomlins character and Sages mother (Harden is first rate) and the quest to help Sage becomes a journey of self-discovery.This fierce poet ultimately embodies Wordsworths definition of their craft ""Emotion recollected in tranquillity."" Weitzs film moves from clunky domestic dramedy to genuine feminist odyssey.------------GrandmaMPAA rating R for language drug useRunning time 1 hour 20 minutesPlaying Arclight Hollywood Landmark Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Reviews Movies Entertainment Lily Tomlin Feminism John Cho Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad71deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-grandma-movie-review-20150821-story.html,200,grandma(2015)25,grandma(2015),latimes

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Theres a long tradition of films treating scrappy and lively older characters as a punchline as if its inherently hilarious to see anyone above 65 swear drink fight acknowledge sex with positivity or enthusiasm or otherwise indicate theyre still alive below the neck. Its taken the aging of the American population and the splintering of the film industry into specialty audiences to move cinema away from that trend. Old folks behaving badly are still a go-to stereotype but theyre being offset by films like Paul Weitzs Grandma which touches on the sentiment and scorn of big prestige-like family dramas like August Osage County but only in the lightest way possible. On paper Grandma may sound like a drama given how it revolves around lost loves life lessons and unwanted pregnancy. In practice it finds the human side of the cussin granny character and turns serious issues and sappy plot developments into a playful only mildly melancholy romp.A good chunk of the credit goes to Lily Tomlin in her first starring film role since 1988s Big Business. Tomlin plays aging poet and ""unemployed academic"" Elle Reid a septuagenarian whos snappish and so ruled by defensive pride that shes alienated many of the people in her life including her estranged daughter Judy (Marcia Gay Harden) and her current lover Olivia (Judy Greer). When her teenage granddaughter Sage (Julia Garner) turns up on her doorstep looking for the money for an abortion she scheduled for the end of the day Elle doesnt have the cash and has just cut up her credit cards to make yet another reckless statement about her independence and freedom. So the two of them go on a road trip hitting up Elles old acquaintances for the money. Along the way Tomlin makes it abundantly entertainingly clear that Elle has never taken shit from anyone in her life. And she wants Sage to follow suit especially when dealing with her sneering immature baby daddy (Nat Wolff). But the same attitude thats brought Elle freedom and some artistic respect has also left a trail of broken relationships behind her and Grandma is more about revealing the limits and regrets of complete independence than about Sages situation or even the evolving relationship between grandmother and granddaughter.Writer-director Paul Weitz could have handled this material in a thousand ways including the broad loud exclamation-point-filled comedy he brought to Little Fockers or the wry restrained grief he brought to About A Boy. But as with in 2012s Being Flynn he navigates awful-sounding material with a gentle sympathetic touch neither overplaying the violent-granny gags nor overselling the moments where the characters bond. Grandma is a rare chance for Weitz to work from an original script instead of adapting a book or sequelizing characters he didnt originate and while Grandma isnt as elaborately worked and narratively complicated as Being Flynn it does bring across Elles story in an innovative way as her small-range trip around town becomes a journey into the past she doesnt want to acknowledge. Instead of exposition about Elles 38-year relationship with her recently deceased partner Violet Weitz offers characters commenting on Elles tattoo of Violets name or how Violet affected their lives. Elle doesnt tell Sage who theyre putting the bite on next or what hazards might come up in the interaction; her history unfolds through action as she visits old acquaintances played by Elizabeth Pena Orange Is The New Blacks Laverne Cox and a shockingly facial-hair-light Sam Elliott.Tomlin and Elliotts scene together is worth the price of admission on its own; hed steal the movie if it wasnt so firmly in her hands. Its a classroom-worthy study in narrative efficiency bringing up information only as its needed but making each progressive evolution of the emotion between them into a new revelation. Both characters underplay a core of fury and sorrow that manifests as human emotion so often does in ways that dont immediately suggest anger or sadness. The sequence is emblematic of the rest of the film--both the restraint and talent that makes it work and the brevity and jumpiness that limits it keeping the story and the emotions small and moving events along with regrettable speed.Grandma is a bottle episode of a movie restrained not in space but in time and incident. It only covers about eight hours in a familys life. The abortion--treated gently and without judgment by the film--may stick with Sage as Elle says for the rest of her life. But the film isnt designed for that kind of large-scale impact. Its an artful funny endlessly surprising little acting and writing showcase that shows just how far its possible for writers to take tired cliched characters by treating them as human beings and caring what goes on underneath the surface of the easy jokes.

Writer-director Paul Weitz after a string of duds that includes ""Admission"" and ""American Dreamz"" officially gets his groove back by teaming up with Lily Tomlin on ""Grandma"" which allows the actress a rare opportunity to paint with all the colors in her seasoned palette. As Tomlins Elle spends a day driving around Los Angeles and catching up with friends and estranged family members she and Weitz bring a rich character to full life. Elle used to be a poet back in the 1970s but its been ages since shes written anything new. (In an argument with her just-dumped ex-girlfriend Olivia played by Judy Greer the younger woman spits ""Writer-in-residence"" as a cutting insult.) Years after the death of her wife Elle drives Olivia away and doesnt talk much with her own daughter Judy (Marcia Gay Harden) so its a surprise when granddaughter Sage (Julia Garner ""The Americans"") comes calling to ask to borrow 600 for an abortion. Watch Video Laverne Cox Tattoos Lily Tomlin in New Grandma Trailer (Video) Having just paid all her debts - and having made a wind chime out of her cut-up credit cards - Elle doesnt have the cash on her and both she and Sage know that while Judys good for the money a scolding from her sharp tongue is best avoided at all costs. After its clear that Sages idiot boyfriend Cam (Nat Wolff ""Paper Towns"") isnt going to cough up the scratch Elle and her granddaughter set out in Elles vintage Dodge to get the money together before Sages appointment later that afternoon. Among those Elle approaches unsuccessfully are Deathy (Laverne Cox) a tattoo artist; feminist diner owner Carla (the late Elizabeth Pena); and Karl (Sam Elliott) who played a larger role in Elles past than is immediately apparent. ""Grandma"" is a tightly conceived road picture one that allows us a glimpse into Elles past while showing us how and where her relationships went wrong (and occasionally right) over the years. Watch Video Sam Elliot Thinks Hollywood Is Hard on Women (Video) Its not fair to say that Tomlin has never been better but its accurate to note that few roles have given her this much to perform. Shes a consummate scene-stealer and her comedic rapport with Jane Fonda is about the only reason to watch her Netflix series ""Grace and Frankie"" but Weitz lets Tomlin loose on the architecture of a complicated lovable hate-able exasperating irascible and ultimately dependable woman and its extraordinary to behold. Also given more to do here than usual is Elliott - for several decades now hes been the kind of reliable supporting actor whose success has more to do with presence than anything else He turns up in a movie we know were going to get a moment of Sam Elliott being Sam Elliott and its going to be great just like it was when Gary Cooper or Cary Grant showed up to play the recognized screen version of themselves. Here Elliott actually gets a character to play - a funny wounded angry longing character and he totally nails it. In just a few scenes he creates one of the richest screen personae hes ever been given. The whole ensemble makes the most of their opportunities Greer finally gets a three-dimensional character in a Summer 2015 movie Garner more than holds her own against her seasoned co-stars Harden finds the humanity in a character that could easily have been a two-dimensional harpy and even veteran Colleen Camp creates comic gold from the bit part of a customer trying desperately to get waitress Olivias attention during a spat with Elle. Also Read Jane Fonda Lily Tomlin Dismiss Talk of Retirement Its a Foreign Concept Cinematographer Tobias Datum (""Smashed"") eschews L.A. cliche giving us an urban landscape thats capable of both great beauty (Karl has a gorgeous house in the hills with a huge lawn) and bland blight and he manages to blot the sun out of this grey day filled with complications and setbacks. ""Grandma"" is both smart and sweet mature and bawdy knowing its characters flaws yet open to the possibilities of people acting upon their best instincts. It is without a doubt one of the years best films even as it lands in theaters amidst the late-summer doldrums. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

(spc) BY Katherine Pushkar NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday August 19 2015 127 PM Title Grandma Film Info Grumpy oldster on a road trip with her granddaughter. Director Paul Weitz (120). R Adult themes language. Lincoln Plaza Angelika. In the slight but sprightly ""Grandma"" Lily Tomlin flips the bird to all of Hollywoods sweet old Nanas and Bubbes. Elle is a different kind of film grandma -- shes a feminist poet. Shes also blunt unapologetic and kind of a jerk. When we meet her shes breaking up with her much younger girlfriend and still mourning her longtime partner Violet. By the time granddaughter Sage (Julia Garner) shows up looking for 600 to pay for an abortion its clear that Elle is not your grandmas ... well you get it. Having cashed out to pay off medical bills Elles strapped herself. So she and Sage pile into Violets 55 Dodge to go hit up old friends and lovers. If thats a flimsy excuse to go on a tour of Elles life complete with pit stops at second- and third-wave feminism well there are worse ways to spend an hour and a half. The light-handed pacing belies all that writer-director Paul Weitz packs in abortion politics aging health care sexuality economics and the radical notion that a woman can be the subject of her own life. As Elle Tomlin is Tomlin which is to say great. Garners Sage is whiny wise and winsome which is to say an excellent 18-year-old. And what a treat to see the late Elizabeth Pena looking rather luminous in her last role as one of Elles human ATMs. Lily Tomlin stars as an irascible elder in ""Grandma."" (spc) ON A MOBILE DEVICE?

"Grandma with Lily Tomlin reviewed American Pie director Paul Weitzs new movie is a deft story about a septuagenarian lesbian widow. Slate Sign In Sign Up Lily Tomlin Stars as a Septuagenarian Lesbian Widow in the Deft Touching Grandma Lily Tomlin Stars as a Septuagenarian Lesbian Widow in the Deft Touching Grandma Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Aug. 19 2015 600 AM Grandma Lily Tomlin stars as a septuagenarian lesbian widow in this deft touching story about grief and moving on. By June Thomas Julia Garner as Sage and Lily Tomlin as Elle in Grandma. Photo courtesy of Sundance Institute/Sony Pictures Classics In Grandmas opening scene Lily Tomlins Elle Reid breaks up with her girlfriend of four months in the cruelest way she can think of ""Youre a footnote"" she tells Olivia (Judy Greer) a minor postscript to the 38-year relationship that ended with the death of Elles partner Vi or Violet 18 months earlier. Olivia burbles on about love but Elle pays her no mind. ""Leave your keys on the coffee table"" she tells the younger woman cold as ice. Then she heads to the shower where she dissolves into tears. June Thomas June Thomas is a Slate culture critic and editor of Outward Slates LGBTQ section. A little later as Elle conjures happier memories by flipping through old photos and perfectly preserved childrens artwork she receives an unexpected visitor Its her teenage granddaughter Sage (Julia Garner) whos pregnant has an appointment to get an abortion in just under nine hours and needs 600 to pay for it. Since Elle a poet and occasional academic writer-in-residence has just 43 to her name and has made a charming if unmelodic wind chime from her chopped-up credit cards theres only one possible course of action The two of them whip the cover off Vis amazing old Dodge and hit the road hoping to find a friend wholl lend them the cash. Advertisement That what follows is transparently a string of guest-star vignettes doesnt make the road trip any less enjoyable to watch. What could have been an abbreviated version of 24 with Tomlin in the Jack Bauer role turns into something far less frantic. Theres no countdown clock on the screen as Elle and Sage ride around Los Angeles. Instead its a gentle journey of enlightenment as Sage gets to see Elle at her worst--when she childishly acts out in a pretentious coffee shop--and at her best when she stands up to dopey young guys and lovesick old men in order to safeguard Sages future. Garner memorable as the lonely high-schooler whose openness to seduction freaked out Matthew Rhys Philip Jennings on The Americans is curious and observant keen to know more about her grandmother than crazy angry misanthropic--the simplistic adjectives her mother uses to describe her. From the kid who knocked up Sage who is objectively an impudent waste of DNA Elle swipes a few bucks and some choice weed; from tattoo artist Deathy (Laverne Cox as a tatted-up Bettie Page type) she receives a small monetary contribution and some fresh ink. A visit to a lesbian-run cafe--where true to life the employees interpersonal drama is far more interesting than the food--provides a reminder that although she claims to have a plan to raise the money Elle has a poets impracticality. The way Grandmas female characters--many of them queer--dress decorate their homes and most importantly talk to each other is so beautifully observed I was sure that Paul Weitz who wrote and directed this movie must be a sixtysomething lesbian rather than the guy who wrote Nutty Professor II The Klumps and directed American Pie. Thats unfair though. Weitz has made fine movies about the challenges of intergenerational communication (In Good Company) estranged parents and children (Being Flynn and Admission) and the loneliness of single parenthood (About a Boy and once again Admission)--and his experience on those projects shines throughout the film but especially during a bravura scene between Tomlin and Sam Elliott as Karl a man from deep in her past. For most of the movie Elle acts like the aggrieved party mumbling complaints about the friends and family members who disappeared when Vi got sick but in her interactions with Karl shes the one who must make amends. Elle and Karl who havent set eyes on each other for three decades move swiftly from polite chatter to real talk. ""You wronged me"" Karl declares with a force that shows the hurt is as raw as it was 49 years earlier when the injury occurred and for once Elle doesnt try to deflect with anger or humor. As you get older Karl says ""old shit just bubbles up."" In confronting her past with Karl Elle finally seems able to let go of mistakes shes been feeling guilty about for almost 50 years. The scene with Karl is so cathartic and Tomlin and Elliotts chemistry is so intense that subsequent events the movie has been building toward--our eventual introduction to Sages mother Judy (Marcia Gay Harden wonderful as an impatient overcaffeinated superlawyer) and the appointment at the abortion clinic--seem slightly anticlimactic. In part thats because the spotlight drifts away from Tomlin who this movie makes clear has been criminally underused in the supporting roles shes typically cast in. Given our cultures tendency to avoid the subject of abortion Grandmas frank treatment of Sages response to her unwanted pregnancy feels revolutionary. The decision to terminate is treated with utmost seriousness and the responsibility is spread around--Sage for making reckless decisions; Judy for paying more attention to work than to her daughter; and Elles generation for failing to make abortion widely available at a reasonable price. But the film isnt about abortion or even really about Sage. Its about grief and the importance of moving on. When Sage forces Elle to ask others for help Elle has to let down her defenses and allow her loved ones to see that her misanthropy is mostly an act. She pushes people away so she can be alone with her memories of Vi. But shes also someones grandma--and at the end of the movie she seems ready to recommit to that role.

Sony Pictures Classics A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Young people are the only ones who ever talk about growing old gracefully. For those actually in the thick of it the romance of that notion burns off pretty quickly and wrinkles and creaky joints are the least of it Growing old gracefully or otherwise means becoming the person you were always meant to be only more so. After days months and years of gradual transformation you wake up one day to find that youre 1000 percent you. Your good qualities have entwined so fixedly with the bad that its hard to distinguish which are which. By the time you feel wholly comfortable in your own skin everyone around you may find you unbearable.Tomlin brings tart grandeur to the role.Film DetailsCritics Pick Grandma RatingR GenreComedy Running Time82 min. More Info Trailer Lily Tomlins performance in writer-director Paul Weitzs Grandma doesnt just hint at that idea -- it lives in it. The movie gets off to a shaky start working too hard to establish the unrepentant prickliness of Tomlins character a widowed poet named Elle. But it gradually settles and deepens into something nuanced and moving a character study thats not so much about aging specifically as it is about the great and awful process of getting to know yourself. As Elle finds out even when you think you know everything theres always more to learn.Grandma opens with a breakup a rather vicious one The seventy-ish Elle is calling it quits with a younger woman we quickly ascertain is her girlfriend -- its the sort of breakup where believing you know where a relationship is headed you drive the knife in farther and deeper than you need to preemptively wounding your partner more than he or she could ever hurt you. The girlfriend Olivia (Judy Greer) stands dumbstruck. As Elles tirade escalates we learn that the two have been seeing each other for only four months but that Elle has always known the age difference would eventually become a problem. We learn that although shes been writing poetry lately shes been lazy about getting it published. Writing poetry is all about paring language to the essential minimum and we learn just how good Elle is at cutting people down too. After making reference to a previous partner one shed been with for nearly 40 years Elle tells Olivia ""Youre a footnote.""Related StoriesWhat Could Beat Cruising With Grandma Star Lily Tomlin?Who says a thing like that? Usually a person who doesnt mean it but that never lessens the sting. Once Olivia understandably hurt and angry takes her leave we learn that Elle isnt as brittle and heartless as she thinks she is a truth that Tomlin imparts to us resolutely but with her back to the camera as if she were guarding Elles privacy.This is just the beginning of the tart subterranean grandeur Tomlin who has always been a marvelous actress but who hasnt had a leading role in nearly 30 years brings to Grandma. This is her second film with Weitz -- she also appeared in his last movie 2013s Admission -- and though the director has said that hed had the basic idea for Grandma for years it wasnt until he met Tomlin that he knew exactly how to write the character. Tomlin fills out the role like a tree spreading its branches and roots though she brings a superb lightness to it too Elles acidity often has a comic kick -- for her wisecracks arent just a defense mechanism but a means of surviving the worst.And she needs those wisecracks perhaps now more than ever Her granddaughter Sage (Julia Garner) shows up on her doorstep announcing that shes pregnant and needs 600 for an abortion. Sage is so ethereal-looking you almost cant quite believe she could conceive a human child -- with her halo of pale-blond curls shes like an Arthur Rackham fairy. But shes all too human and Elle after briefly berating her for her carelessness agrees to help even though having recently cut up all her credit cards shes low on funds herself. The two pile into Elles car a bumptiously elegant 1955 Dodge Royal (Tomlins own bought in 1975) in search of the money Sage needs to solve her problem.During this road trip the thorny multi-dead-end map of family resentments is laid out. Sage doesnt dare tell her distracted businesswoman mother Judy (played with both sharpness and subtlety by Marcia Gay Harden) about the pregnancy. Elle isnt speaking to Judy either -- the two have had a falling-out. Whats more all three women are still in mourning for Violet Elles longtime partner Judys mom and Sages other grandmother She died not so long ago after suffering through an illness. Grandma is a multigenerational story in which men are side players though theyre not completely negligible. In one of the movies finest and most piercing scenes Elle and Sage seek out one of Elles old friends who it turns out was at one time something more. Karl (Sam Elliott) is happy enough to see Elle but hes puzzled too. What follows is part tender reconciliation part brutal showdown. Its also a point of reckoning for Elle who has a seemingly endless ability to inflict damage on other people. (Elliott was recently seen in Brett Haleys intimately magnificent comedy-drama Ill See You in My Dreams and hes just as terrific here.)Elle seems not to care that she has caused pain -- and yet she betrays in the smallest of ways that she does care. In one of the movies slyest moments Elle a woman whose beauty is of the no-makeup and uncombed-hair variety adds a swipe of lipstick just before she and Sage head off to see Karl -- there is no woman who doesnt occasionally feel the need for some sexual armor. But Elles calculation is all right there on the surface not just on her lips but also in her quips and her barbs. Her tenderness runs much deeper as she shows in a late scene where she reconnects with Olivia perhaps showing her erstwhile lover more kindness in ten minutes than shed shown during the course of the duos brief relationship.Temperamentally Tomlins character in Grandma is nothing like the one she played so long ago in Robert Altmans Nashville a dutiful married mother of two who succumbs to the seductive charms of Keith Carradines singer-songwriter Casanova. But watching Tomlin here as a woman who is 1000 percent herself and could perhaps use a little dilution I kept thinking of that scene in Nashville -- possibly its most beautiful -- where Carradine sings to Tomlin from the stage of a packed club. She listens her face immobile but as filled with feeling as a cupful of tears. She knows that even if he has dozens or hundreds of lovers this song is only for her. The song is everything and not just for the moment -- its something to be carried forward for the rest of life even after the lover is long gone. Tomlin packed a lifetime of future feeling into those few moments of Nashville. In Grandma she shows us the aftermath of the song. The short version Life went on. It was terrible. It was wonderful.Grandma Written and directed by Paul Weitz Sony Pictures Classics Opens August 21 Lincoln Plaza Cinema and Angelika Film CenterWritten and directed by Paul Weitz.

So he wrote a script with her in every scene. The resulting film is just that some truly entertaining quality time in the company of this legend. If youve ever wondered what it might be like to have Lily Tomlin as your straight-shooting grandmother ""Grandma"" is the fix you need for the lack of that in your real life. Tomlin is Elle a poet and in the opening scene we get to know her brutally honest personality as she dumps her much younger girlfriend Olivia (Judy Greer) in the harshest of ways. Elles a softie though she just doesnt really show it to anyone else. Its a difficult scene to introduce our lead but we know what were going to get with her. Throughout the course of the film we get know Elle as she really is a salty rabble-rousing free spirit who doesnt give a whip about what other people think. The best possible onscreen role model basically. The plot is set in motion when Elles granddaughter Sage (Julia Garner) shows up on her doorstep in a family way and needing money for the abortion. The two set off on a day-long journey to scrounge up the cash in time for the 545 appointment. As Elle attempts to suss out just who in her life she might be able to borrow money from we get a bit of a ""This is Your Life"" plot where she seeks out old friends old flames and finally her ferocious daughter (Marcia Gay Harden) a hard-charging and over-caffeinated executive who has taken all of the hard bits she got from her mother and honed them to a razors edge. The best part about ""Grandma"" is the sensitive and insightful script by Weitz--every line is instantly quotable little nuggets of sardonic life wisdom that should be needlepointed onto a pillow. Tomlin is obviously a delight and truly its a treat to spend the time with her. Garner is a winsome waif who holds her own against Tomlin a thoroughly modern foil to Elles second-wave feminism. Still its clear that Sage as much to learn from Grandma and Grandmas still learning herself. A true standout performance comes from Sam Elliott who plays Carl an old friend of Elles and one of their stops along the way. Elliott who often is playing some version of ""Sam Elliott"" gives a truly stripped down and vulnerable performance  in his short time on screen. Hes charming seductive and heartbreaking in that order and its the finest work weve seen from him recently. His presence supports the films unshowy thesis that asserts the humanity and personhood of older people--they are sexy and flawed works-in-progress even if they are also ""Grandma"" and ""Grandpa."" The films title is a cheeky nod to this because this grandma aint like any other grandma thats been on screen; this one is tough and violent and sassy and scared a fully developed fully realized person whose company it is a pleasure to be in. On the surface ""Grandma"" is a simple story but the script imbues it with deep reserves of emotional depth and meaning that are slowly organically revealed over the course of the plot. Its a ""day in the life"" film that manages to portray a whole life in one day. Paul Weitz had good instincts about his leading lady and the two make the perfect pair.

Elle Reid a tart-tongued septuagenarian author who charges through life like a bull in a china shop is the sort of character Lily Tomlin might have created decades ago and added to her repertoire alongside Ernestine the indiscreet telephone operator and Edith Ann the philosophical 5-year-old in her oversized rocking chair. But its doubtful the 75-year-old Tomlin could have played Elle then with the same deep reserves of anger and sorrow she brings to ""Grandma"" an initially breezy family comedy about mothers daughters and abortions that slowly sneaks up on you and packs a major wallop. A most impressive detour into low-budget DIY filmmaking for writer-director Paul Weitz (""American Pie"" ""About a Boy"") this constantly surprising character piece should spark deserved awards chatter for Tomlin and at least one of her co-stars as well as solid (if far from ""Juno""-sized) indie box office. Weitz (who first worked with Tomlin on the middling 2013 campus comedy ""Admission"") has clearly written a lot of the actress herself into Elle and like Michael Keaton in the recent ""Birdman"" Tomlin plays the part with a certain air of knowing self-regard and the gratitude of a performer who long ago aged out of Hollywood leading-lady roles. A poet whose work is catnip to womens-studies majors and the like Elle hasnt written much since the death of her longtime partner Violet and has only sharpened her acerbic defenses against the world. When we first see her shes in the midst of breaking up with her new and much younger girlfriend Olivia (Judy Greer) -- one of a few early scenes in ""Grandma"" that feel a bit rushed and underwritten. Then Elles teenage granddaughter Sage (frizzy-haired Julia Garner) shows up out of the blue and announces that shes pregnant and needs Elles help to terminate it. Weitz has a lot of expositional baggage to unload and for a while ""Grandma"" doesnt engender much audience confidence. Sage has made an appointment at an abortion clinic for that very afternoon and they dont have another slot available for days. But shes flat broke and her mother Judy (Marcia Gay Harden) whom she doesnt really want to bring into this anyway has recently confiscated her credit card. Elle meanwhile has just finished paying off all her credit-card debt -- an accomplishment she celebrated by cutting them up and turning the plastic pieces into a wind chime. (""Im transmogrifying my life into art"" she proudly declares.) The only possible solution of course is to take to the streets of L.A. in Elles vintage Dodge Royal and go door-to-door in search of the 600 Sage needs for the procedure (an amount that prompts outrage from Elle who exclaims ""Where can you get a reasonably priced abortion these days?"") That gently contrived premise -- a gynecological ""Nebraska"" if you will -- is enough to get ""Grandma"" on the road literally and figuratively. And as the characters crisscross the city over the course of the day their journey becomes an unforced but unmistakably political survey of three generations of independent womanhood in America. Like Tomlin herself Elle was an out lesbian long before it was widely accepted and her daughter Judy had Sage through an anonymous sperm donor. And now it is Sages turn to make a critical decision about her own body and the life of her unborn child -- a decision ""Grandma"" unambiguously argues it is hers and only hers to make. The first act of ""Grandma"" plays out in fairly broad strokes with the ill-tempered Elle wreaking predictable havoc in a gourmet coffee shop (unforgivably built on the former site of a free womens clinic) a hipster womens cafe (where she tries to sell her prized first editions of ""The Feminine Mystique"" to the disinterested proprietress played by the late Elizabeth Pena) and the living room of Sages deadbeat boyfriend (Nat Wolff) whom she attacks with his own hockey stick. Such scenes are lightly diverting and often very funny thanks to Tomlins wonderfully cutting delivery the spunky Gerners agog reaction shots and Weitzs smart barbed dialogue. (This is surely the first movie in history where ""solipsist"" and ""writer-in-residence"" become epithets in a jilted-lover screaming match.) But where ""Grandma"" takes an unexpected turn and really hooks you is in a long mid-film sequence that finds Elle and Sage alighting at the home of Karl (Sam Elliott) a mystery man Elles past whose deep pockets just might save the day. What follows is probably the single finest scene Tomlin and Elliott have ever played onscreen -- a knowing tender and finally devastating reunion between two old friends whose lives intertwined once upon a time and who have been irrevocably scarred by the decisions they made back then. Still slender and tan and dry as the desert wind Karl tallies up ex-wives kids and grandkids while Elle rolls a joint and joins him on a stroll down memory lane. And gradually as we come to understand who these two people have been to each other and what happened to cleave them apart the scene accrues a stunning emotional power. The 70-year-old Elliott who has played countless cowboys lawmen and tough guys has never opened himself up like this in a movie before or seemed so fragile and vulnerable beneath the flinty macho facade. In about 10 minutes of screen time he creates a fuller richer character than most actors do given two hours and Tomlin is every bit as good as the woman who understands his pain but is helpless to relieve it. ""Grandma"" continues to negotiate a nimble balance between the poignant and the ribald all the way to the finish of its brisk 78-minute running time including a terrific bit where Elle and Sage finally confront the workaholic Judy in her office (where she works at a moving ""treadmill desk""). Though likely to be variously praised and pilloried as a pro-choice film Weitzs film is really a movie about choice in both the specific and the abstract -- about the choices we make for good and for ill and how we come to feel about them through the prism of time. ""Time passes. Thats for sure"" reads an onscreen epigram at the start of ""Grandma"" a quotation from the poet Eileen Myles (another model for the Tomlin character) and like Myles Weitz suggests there are few other certainties in life. We will grow older maybe wiser perhaps a bit more tolerant but no closer to understanding the stirrings of the human heart.

Reply Warner905 says October 6 2015 at 150 pm To be fair to the filmmakers they do cover the long term mental and emotional consequences of women who make the choice to have an abortion. Reply devisschLynn says January 31 2015 at 459 pm Yes  Reply Scott MacDonough says January 27 2015 at 1125 pm My highest praise to Mr. Foundas for the most eloquently intelligently written review I have read from any film critic in years. He makes me anxious to see a movie I otherwise would have had little interest in and in doing so reminds us that movie criticism can be an art in itself.

Daily Edition Login to download Grandma Film Review 346 PM PST 1/26/2015 by David Rooney FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Julia Garner and Lily Tomlin in Grandma Courtesy of Sundance Film Festival A sublime match of performer and role TWITTER Paul Weitz casts Lily Tomlin as a misanthropic poet on an embattled quest to help her granddaughter in this warm character-driven comedy-drama. Lily Tomlin pretty much stole all her scenes as Tina Feys acerbic radical feminist mother in the otherwise patchy Admission and it appears that director Paul Weitz thought so too as hes hand-tailored her a honey of a role in Grandma. Playing an ill-tempered lesbian on an all-day odyssey to raise the money her granddaughter needs for an abortion Tomlin is in her glorious element. It doesnt hurt that there are numerous other expertly gauged performances to savor plus a bundle of heart in this small-scale but consistently funny and poignant comedy-drama. While its very much Tomlins show the movie is actually about three generations of women -- the forces that shape and scar them the thorny histories and divergent life choices that distance them the lessons they absorb or ignore and the ties among them that weaken but seldom break. And though the termination of a pregnancy is what drives the plot that sorrowful step is treated with the gravity it warrants in a story thats also about the many imperfect paths of motherhood. Grandma is not as self-congratulatory and in-your-face as the recent Obvious Child about its evolved position on abortion as a regrettable but necessary option in many young womens lives. But theres admirable frankness intelligence and sensitivity here. Additionally the film is a thoughtful funny reflection on the gains and losses of growing old. A once-celebrated poet now barely scraping by on the academic beat Elle (Tomlin) is introduced refusing to soften the breakup with Olivia (Judy Greer) her younger girlfriend of the past four months. ""Youre a footnote"" she tells Olivia -- its dismissive but also sadly true given Elles still-fresh grief over her 38-year partner Violets death a year and a half earlier. While Elle is sitting around getting maudlin about the past her granddaughter Sage (Julia Garner) a high school senior rolls up to her Los Feliz house and drops the bomb that shes pregnant. Unwilling to tell her bossy mother whose relationship with Elle is strained to say the least Sage has scheduled an abortion for that afternoon and needs 600 to pay for it. The film makes a sweet joke about lesbians and their wind chimes by having Elles made out of the pieces of her cut-up credit cards. Her strapped financial state means she has to call in favors to raise the cash and her sour nature means there are few friends to whom she can turn. Even when bridges havent been burned like with transgender tattooist Deathy (Laverne Cox) the latters economic pinch limits how much she can help out. There are some hilarious early opportunities for Elle to vent her foul-mouthed irascibility and zero tolerance for ""assholes"" notably with an uptight barista (John Cho) in a coffee shop that was formerly a free womens health center and at a cafe where she tries to sell some first editions to the flinty owner (the late Elizabeth Pena in one of her final roles). Sage stands by dumbstruck while Grandma hurls invective and though the girl is no dummy she does think The Feminine Mystique is an X-Men character amusingly underlining the canyon-wide generation gap. An attempt to pressure the babys deadbeat father Cam (Nat Wolff) yields minimal gains but it does serve for Elle to sort him out with an ice hockey stick and score a bag of weed that comes in handy later. Where the film really kicks in and gains emotional weight however is in a beautiful scene with Karl (Sam Elliott just perfection) a mellow old romantic with four ex-wives and a tribe of grandchildren who hasnt seen Elle in 30 years. He agrees to lend her the money but their painful unresolved history gets in the way before the deal is done. As their trail of frustration continues against a ticking clock it becomes clear that taking the dilemma to Sages mother Judy (Marcia Gay Harden) is their best option. A power lawyer with a trembling assistant (Mo Aboul-Zelof) Judy is a fire-breathing chip off the old block and the marvelous Harden nails her every brilliant barb as well as the whole frazzled history with her mother. But as Sages appointment draws nearer with other setbacks second thoughts and fears along the way the three women reach a tentative mutual understanding. Not every scene benefits from flawless timing especially early on and Weitz arguably pushes the sentiment buttons by indicating more often than is necessary the specter of the much-mourned Violet hanging in the air. The sappy string score could also have been improved upon. But this is a refreshingly modest no-frills movie that is character-driven in the most rewarding possible sense with an ample share of priceless dialogue played for truth not for jokes. The performances are lovely including that of up-and-comer Garner who has many touching moments as Sage alternates between recoiling from and reaching for her mother and grandmother. However everything in the movie revolves around the irreplaceable Tomlin and rightly so. Her entire history as an actor a comedian a feminist and a pioneering voice for LGBT rights comes into play in this formfitting role. Anybody who loves her -- and if you dont why are you even reading? -- wont want to miss this.
