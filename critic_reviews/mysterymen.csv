Comments Mystery Men In this 1999 action comedy based on Bob Burdens comic books Ben Stiller nearly steals the show as a low-profile superhero whose greatest weapon is his temper--which occasionally gives him the power to do minor property damage or hurt bad guys slightly but usually just prevents him from getting dates. But he has stiff competition from his cohorts including Hank Azaria whos armed with pounds of flatware and a fake accent; William H. Macy whose wife cant bear to watch him leave the house each day to fight crime wielding only a shovel; and Janeane Garofalo whose aggression is fueled by unresolved issues with her dad. This slapstick and effects vehicle depends on poker-faced performances production design that enhances the story partly because it doesnt have to compensate for it and a premise that provides seemingly inexhaustible opportunities for pratfalls and clever lines. The characters have been designed to make fun of themselves disguising the craft of writer Neil Cuthbert and director Kinka Usher in getting us to laugh at them. With Kel Mitchell Paul Reubens Greg Kinnear Geoffrey Rush Claire Forlani Wes Studi and Tom Waits. 111 min.

Starring Hank Azaria Janeane Garofalo Greg Kinnear William H. Macy Paul Reubens Geoffrey Rush Ben Stiller Wes Studi and Tom Waits. Directed by Kinka Usher. (PG-13. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Someone ought to give the casting director of ""Mystery Men"" a prize. Maybe its no mystery how they did it considering the aggregate comic talent but this bunch achieves peaks of sublime nuttiness. Just look at this gallery of ordinary joes who want to make it big in the superhero game despite the handicap of having no super powers -- Janeane Garofalo as the Bowler with her uncanny dead-on delivery both of her enshrined-skull bowling ball and her lines. -- Ben Stiller entirely in black right up to his dont-mess-with-me-mister glare as Mr. Furious a biker who rides a Harley Compatible. -- Hank Azaria as the Blue Raja a ""master of cutlery"" who wears green and can throw spoons but not a knife. -- William H. Macy as the Shoveler a straight arrow in a hard hat who whips out his spade with the aplomb of a cowboy drawing his six-gun. Thats just for starters. Then theres Greg Kinnear Geoffrey Rush and Paul Reubens. Waits. Theres more. Tom Waits -- thats right as a grizzled mad genius -- and Claire Forlani who may be the most familiar to the independent souls who had the good sense to see ""Meet Joe Black"" and the actor who may just steal the show from them all Wes Studi. The opening shots of ""Mystery Men"" based on the cult comic book created by Bob Burden feel like a Terry Gilliam (""Brazil"") time warp. Champion City is presented as a futuristic urbanscape with thingies flying through the air but the women wear 1940s hats. A party at an old-folks home is invaded by the Red Eyes who have red hair too and its time for the Mystery Men working-class stiffs who moonlight as heroes to go into klutzy action. There is one full-time superhero Captain Amazing played with an off-kilter crazed look by Kinnear. Amazing is also something of a worrywart. A superhero needs a super-villain he broods and theres none left in Champion City. Amazing whose uniform is covered with product logos is by no means as dense as he may seem. He has flashes of profound understanding of how the superstar business works. ""I thought it was all about publicity and keeping your sponsors happy."" There is one great villain Casanova Frankenstein (Rush) but he is in prison. Amazing who has a Clark Kent-like double life as bespectacled Lance arranges to get Casanova paroled so his alter ego will have a worthy enemy. The scheme backfires and the Mystery Men must recruit other would-be heroes to save Amazing. When they all gang up to attack Casanovas car with their various shovels spoons and bad attitudes the audience gets giddy with delight. ""Mystery Men"" the best big-production comic fantasy since ""Addams Family Values"" was directed by a TV commercial director Kinka Usher. Dont knock it. He knows how to get in and get out quickly and make strong visual points. There is a have-your-cake-and- eat-it-too parody of pyrotechnic climaxes. Cliches get a double-spin that gives them new life such as the seen-it-all diner waitress (Forlani) giving encouragement to Stillers insecure angry guy (""Right now Im kinda like a powder keg"" he declares) or Macy delivering an inspirational speech. All sorts of sacred cows are roasted. The Shoveler has a perfect interracial family the blond African American Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell) has the movies biggest moment (and Garofalo the coolest reaction to it). The Spleen (Reubens) has a se cret weapon that wipes out people when they get wind of it. The skull in the Bowlers bowling ball is that of her beloved bowling champion father. The iconic-faced Studi (""Dances With Wolves"" ""The Last of the Mohicans"" ""Geronimo"") is the guru the Sphinx. He has an endless supply of clunky kung fu aphorisms and gobbledygook tautologies. He gives ""leadership training"" to the would- be heroes including slogans (""You must be like wolf pack not six- pack"") and ugh group hugs. ..

"Mystery Men (PG-13) Related Item ""Mystery Men"" showtimes Best Part of Film No Mystery By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday August 6 1999 William H. Macy Kel Mitchell Ben Stiller Hank Azaria Paul Reubens and Janeane Garofalo play superheros in ""Mystery Men."" (Universal) Director Sam Raimi Cast Hank Azaria; Ben Stiller; Greg Kinnear; Geoffrey Rush; Janeane Garofalo; William H. Macy; Kel Mitchell; Paul Reubens; Claire Forlani Running Time 2 hours Contains a couple of mildly bad words bathroom humor sexual innuendo and cartoon violence A full forty-five minutes into ""Mystery Men"" the sputtering spoof of comic-book superheroes seems about to conk out under the weight of the worlds longest most tedious exposition. But then faster than a speeding script doctor more powerful than a William Morris talent agent and able to leap tall plot inconsistencies in a single bound Paul ""Pee-wee Herman"" Reubens rushes in to rescue the foundering film and carry it to goofy glorious victory. Reubens (the former Groundlings actor best known for the demented man-child he played on TV and the silver screen in the 80s) is a national treasure of whom we have seen far too little since he was arrested for indecent exposure in 1991. In ""Mystery Men"" hes one of the best things - along with the ever-astringent Janeane Garofalo - to bounce across the screen. Keeping their loopy characters called the Spleen and the Bowler out of the first half of the movie is a major miscalculation. Yes I know how the formula works how the tease is all part of the narrative build. How a ragtag band of underdog superheroes - in this case a trio of whining dysfunction known as Mr. Furious (a tantrum-throwing Ben Stiller) the Shoveler (a spade-wielding William H. Macy) and the Blue Raja (a turbaned Brit-accented Hank Azaria armed with forks and spoons) - must first be beaten down before they can seek reinforcements. How they must first be humiliated before they attempt to rescue Captain Amazing (Greg Kinnear) defeat arch-villain Casanova Frankenstein (Geoffrey Rush) and redeem themselves in the eyes of the Champion City citizenry. As in a host of cinematic precursors assembling a cadre of warriors - even delusional and incompetent ones - takes time. Right. Except this aint ""The Seven Samurai"" and director Kinka Usher is no Akira Kurosawa. After a clumsily choreographed battle scene in a nursing home and almost an hour of slowpoky set-up ""Mystery Men"" finally hits its stride with the requisite and for the most part droll audition montage - so familiar to viewers from ""The Commitments"" ""The Full Monty"" and movies of that ilk. Featuring tryouts by such superhero wannabes as Pencilhead Son of Pencilhead (""We erase crime"") and my personal favorite the PMS Avenger (""I only work four days a month. Do you have a problem with that?"") the scene generates the films first real sustained laughter and sets the frothy lowbrow tone for the rest of the story. Once the team is assembled ""Mystery Men"" kicks into high gear with a steady blast of sophomoric humor (a sassy fusion of the sharp and the stupid from writer Neil Cuthbert) that rarely lets up. In addition to Furious Shoveler and Raja the team of seven - six mystery men and one woman - includes the Bowler (Garofalo with a Lucite ball containing the skull of her dead father) Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell who may or may not have the ability to become well you know) the Sphinx (Wes Studi as a caped and masked crusader spouting aphorisms poached from 12-step recovery programs) and the aforementioned Spleen. Reubenss uproarious impersonation of a toon made-up with a face full of warty skin eruptions and a ""Spinal Tap""-style wig splashes through his sibilant dialogue with a Daffy Duck speech impediment that turns every ""ess"" into a saliva-soaked sputter. His secret weapon - something that should not be elaborated upon in detail in a family newspaper - can best be described as Silent But Deadly (but truth be told its not all that silent). Yes thats the long and the short of it. As incisive as a loud wet raspberry and about as full of topical gravitas as the Dark Horse comic book on which its based (despite a bad guy called Big Tobacco) ""Mystery Men"" is one half of a very funny movie and as we enter these dog days of August half a funny movie is better than none.

That the reigning superhero of Champion City employs a flack and that the flack is indeed played by Americas greatest magician Ricky Jay says a lot about this larky gig Directed by ""Yo quiero Taco Bell"" adman Kinka Usher as if Joel Schumachers Batman blueprints had been left out to bleach and crinkle in the L.A. sun the movie throws together a hipster cast in the service of deconstructing the superhero lifestyle. And as with most hipster projects this ones got a bunch of great bits from a group of eccentric talents and not enough bourgeois discipline to see the story through. The irresistible notion of Mystery Men is that while Captain Amazing is held captive by his evil hearty-partying nemesis Casanova Frankenstein (Geoffrey Rush) a band of nudnick superhero wannabes seize the moment to show their stuff and improve their media profiles. Their stuff though is ludicrously dubious The Blue Raja (Hank Azaria divinely faux-British) throws cutlery -- but never knives; Mr. Furious (apoplectic Ben Stiller) lives up to his name as a ""ticking time bomb of fury""; The Shoveler (William H. Macy) an earnest Everyman wacky only in his obsession (a great Macy specialty) wields digging implements; The Spleen (Paul Reubens recycling Pee-wee Herman faces) produces near-lethal flatulence; Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell) becomes transparent only if no one looks at him; The Bowler (Janeane Garofalo) strikes down adversaries with a ball containing the skull of her dead-but-still-nagging father. Its a mystery that Mystery Men ever wrapped at all given the performers involved each probably loath to stifle ad-libbed zingers even after Usher yelled ""Cut"" Of course Usher could have ditched shtick in the editing too. But what to lose? The nutty too-long bit in which Wes Studi as a bargain-basement Yoda teaches cooperation by reciting inane aphorisms? The goofy too-long superhero audition sequence? The clunky plot-propelling transitions staged on obsessively ornate sets? ""We fight crime. Call it what you will"" The Shoveler says of his teams claim to superhero status. Call Mystery Men a sketchbook in search of a movie; its still a super idea in a summer of flackery.

Sharply written pic achieves a nice balance of fondness and satiric snap character laughs and goofy action. An amiable spoof of comic book heroes ""Mystery Men"" may well contain more total yuks than the summers other big pop sendup the second ""Austin Powers"" but it also spreads them over an ultimately tiresome two hours. Sharply written with a lavish look and top-drawer effects adding to the appeal of its large and talented cast pic achieves a nice balance of fondness and satiric snap character laughs and goofy action. Its too bad then that its numerous virtues are undercut by a signal failure to follow the leave-em-wanting-more rule so crucial to comedy. Pic is easily 20 minutes too long and its overstayed welcome will likely confine it to so-so B.O. Paean to the worlds super-underachievers kicks off in futuristic Champion City with a large-scale robbery that draws the would-be derring-do of three earnest but unlikely saviors. The Blue Raja (Hank Azaria) sports a turban and Brit accent and tries to subdue his enemies by flinging forks and spoons. The Shoveler (William H. Macy) wears a hard hat and wields a shovel while blustering leather-clad Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller) attempts to level opponents with his bad temper. Its not a good night for the team of fearless freelancers. Once again their bumbling heroics are overshadowed by the arrival of the citys pre-eminent superhero the gleaming-toothed Captain Amazing (Greg Kinnear). But the good captain is not as secure as he seems; his success has put all the citys great supervillains out of commission. Anxious to retain his renown he secures the prison release of one his archnemeses Casanova Frankenstein (Geoffrey Rush) who promptly sets himself up in a disco-equipped castle and begins plotting citywide mayhem. Once Frankenstein manages to turn the tables on Amazing and imprison him in his dungeon the Blue Raja the Shoveler and Mr. Furious realize what a challenge faces them and decide to stage a recruitment drive to beef up their team. A citywide talent search turns up all manner of sad-sack hero hopefuls but eventually they settle on three new members who seem a cut above average. Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell) hasnt yet made himself invisible but sounds determined to do so. Pimple-faced Spleen (Paul Reubens) targets villains with his precision-aimed flatulence. And the Bowler (Janeane Garofalo) has her fathers skull encased in a supernaturally effective bowling ball. Under the tutelage of a gnomic hero coach called the Sphinx (Wes Studi) and aided by grizzled Doc Heller (Tom Waits) the six heroes -- who never decide on a name for their group -- gear up to save Champion City from the nefarious Frankenstein. Though pic boasts several action sequences that are expertly handled and laden with dazzling effects its most engaging passages by far are the ones focusing on the central sextets banter and interaction. Scripter Neil Cuthberts dialogue is hip and consistently funny and provides the basis for appealing flavorful perfs by pics expert ensemble. Macy Stiller Azaria and Garofalo all are as distinctively droll as ever while Reubens (almost unrecognizable in long hair and makeup) makes a pleasing return to form and newcomer Mitchell registers solidly as the all-too-palpable Invisible Boy. Rush and Kinnears spirited supporting work adds to the fun. Main flaw here is a familiar case of too much of a good thing. That the script needed careful focusing in the pre-production stages is indicated for example by the short shrift given co-star Lena Olin in the end product. It seems that some bits already have ended up on the cutting-room floor but for the whole not to seem overlong many more needed to land in the same place. Debuting helmer Kinka Usher gives the production strong pacing and polish though his reliance on extreme wide-angle lenses tends to make pics look a bit monotonous. Tech credits are all first-rate.
