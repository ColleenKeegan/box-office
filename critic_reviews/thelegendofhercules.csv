Comments (2) The Legend of Hercules Video Rated PG-13  99 minutes  2014 Essentially a Monday Night Raw episode with mythological dressing this tacky sword-and-sandals production focuses almost exclusively on Herculess ass-kicking abilities. I found it rather watchable for a sadistic bonehead fantasy; the inept dialogue is good for at least a few belly laughs and Renny Harlin (an erstwhile A-list action director whos been scraping rock bottom for some time) keeps the violence moving swiftly enough. With Kellan Lutz Johnathon Schaech Rade Serbedzija and direct-to-video star Scott Adkins trying his best to deliver an actual performance as King Amphitryon.

Share Tweet Whether intentionally or not The Legend Of Hercules plays like an attempt to revive peplum the sword-and-sandals genre that dominated the Italian B-movie industry from the late 1950s to the mid-1960s. Shot on the cheap in Bulgaria (which has superseded Italy as Europes premier producer of B-films) the movie inadvertently recreates a key part of peplums camp appeal its inherent phoniness. There are muscle men with modern hairstyles and perfect electric-beard-trimmer stubble squaring off against each other in recognizably Eastern European forests. There is cut-rate 3-D which recalls the low-budget effects work of yesteryear; in one scene a green-screened-in background appears completely flat like a painted backdrop. The dialogue isnt dubbed but is written and delivered so indifferently that it might as well have been.The script credited to four writers dispenses with most of the Hercules myth instead inventing a conflict between the hero (Kellan Lutz) and his adopted father King Amphitryon (direct-to-video action star Scott Adkins). Adkins who excels at playing brooding loners is woefully miscast; hes also far too young to be playing a middle-aged character and his paste-on beard doesnt exactly contribute to his credibility in the role. Lutz however would be miscast in just about any role. He simply cant act and spends much of the movie looking like a confused Labrador retriever his head slightly cocked eyes communicating a willingness to please the audience combined with an inability to understand what hes being asked to do.While The Legend Of Hercules offers plenty for viewers whove acquired a taste for the fake and incompetent (not the least of which is the dialogue which finds characters saying each others names at the end of every other sentence) its unlikely to please anyone who wants entertainment in the conventional sense. Neither cinematographer Sam McCurdy (best known for his work with Neil Marshall) nor director Renny Harlin invest the film with much personality. Harlin was once one of Hollywoods biggest blockbuster directors but has since become a gun for hire; his last two films were 5 Days Of War (2011) a movie about the 2008 war between Russia and Georgia financed by the Georgian government and Devils Pass (2013) a found-footage horror movie financed by Russian investors. Since re-inventing himself as a sort of international co-production mercenary Harlin seems to have lost much of the visual sense that distinguished films like Die Hard 2 Nightmare On Elm Street 4 The Dream Master and The Long Kiss Goodnight. Style-wise The Legend Of Hercules peaks with its first shot a ""single take"" (actually a combination of digital effects and several shots stitched together) that starts underwater and then flies over a battlefield toward a besieged city as arrows fly toward the camera. Its a striking opening but it sets a high bar that the movie never reaches again. Instead Harlin sticks to a combination of slow and sped-up motion (a la Zack Snyder) in subsequent battle scenes. The technique only occasionally effective has a tinge of sadness to it. Harlins own style once guaranteed box-office success; now hes been reduced to imitating other filmmakers.

"Review The Legend of Hercules is weakened by cliches - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review The Legend of Hercules is weakened by cliches (By Oliver Gettell) Martin Tsai Unspooled in the January dumping ground and not screened for critics Renny Harlins ""The Legend of Hercules"" has preemptively conceded defeat in its duel with Brett Ratners ""Hercules"" the other Hollywood project based on the same Greek hero due this year.One of the best-known figures in Greek mythology Hercules has yet to receive serious cinematic regard. Besides serving as a bit player in films such as ""Immortals"" and ""Jason and the Argonauts"" Hercules has been the subject of one wisecracking animated musical from Disney and numerous live-action features straight out of the ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" canon. FULL COVERAGE Winter movie sneaks 2014No matter how absurd though the 1958 Steve Reeves starrer the 1983 Lou Ferrigno vehicle and the 1997 cartoon -- all titled ""Hercules"" -- at least nodded at classical mythology. Harlins boasts a Hercules in name chiefly and banks on moviegoers ignorance. Sean Hood and Daniel Giats script-by-number screenplay hits every obligatory plot point of the genre imaginable illegitimate child sibling rivalry love triangle slave trade mud wrestling public lashing and epic battles. In other words its ""47 Ronin"" transported from feudal Japan to ancient Greece.If you admire Kellan Lutzs chiseled body ""The Legend of Hercules"" does offer plenty of that in 3-D glory.calendarlatimes.com------------------------------ The Legend of HerculesMPAA rating PG-13 for sequences of intense combat action and violence and for some sensualityRunning time 1 hour 38 minutesPlaying In general release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Movies Animation (Movie Genre) Arts and Culture Reviews Hercules (movie) Immortals (movie) Two by two including the arks used to film Noah Lone Survivor carries out its mission reviews say Transcendence into directing for cinematographer Wally Pfister Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad83deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-hercules-review,0,1705577.story#axzz2qECYQ2BX",200,thelegendofhercules2,thelegendofhercules,latimes

Twas ever thus since Jason and his Argonauts sailed Ray Harryhausens wine-dark seas through the krakens release in Clash of the Titans.Do not the gods deserve the best special effects we can lavish upon them? By Heras hairy lip they doThey also probably deserve a cohesive plot and dialogue that clarifies rather than confuses but in The Legend of Hercules theyll have to settle just for the special effects.Heres the CliffsNotes version (which they really should pass out as you enter the theater) Its 1200 B.C. and Hercules (Kellan Lutz who looks like the late Paul Walker on industrial-strength steroids) is banished to Egypt by evil King Amphitryon (Scott Adkins). There he is taken captive and must fight as a gladiator in order to make his way back to Greece before his beloved (Gaia Weiss) is forced to marry another man.It would seem director Renny Harlin has been watching Spartacus on cable because the battle scenes borrow the shows slow- and stop-action style. The copious bloodbath of the TV series is avoided entirely. In fact you wont see a drop spilled in The Legend of Hercules though many people die violent deaths.You will however see Liam McIntyre the actor who replaced Andy Whitfield as the hero in Spartacus. Here he plays Sotiris Hercs wingman and tag-team partner.Except for one rampage at the end Hercules doesnt really display much raw strength. Mostly he seems indestructible taking three arrows in the chest as a minor annoyance. But his father Zeus does give him a crackling electric whip like the kind Mickey Rourke had in Iron Man 2.The Legend of Hercules may not track but Harlin still knows how to set up a rousing circus.

"The Legend of Hercules half star Article Comments () Things to do >> Movies >> Article The Legend of Hercules half star SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments By Randy Cordova The Republic | azcentral.com Mon Jan 13 2014 1147 AM There are two movies featuring the character of Hercules set for release this year. The good thing about that newsy little tidbit Julys ""Hercules"" will have to be an improvement over this weeks ""The Legend of Hercules."" Thats not mere optimism. It would be nearly impossible to make a movie more dreary and tedious than this entry in the Greek demigod sweepstakes. Imagine the second feature at a Saturday kiddie matinee with all the fun sucked out and youll get some idea of the level everyone here is working at. This movie stars charisma-free Kellan Lutz from the ""Twilight"" movies as Hercules. Most of the other leading actors in the film are (A) British or (B) speaking with convincing British accents which leaves Lutz sticking out like a frat boy at King Arthurs court. Director and co-writer Renny Harlin (""Die Hard 2"") makes Hercules (the son of Zeus in case youve forgotten) a lunk-headed stud with a nebbish brother Iphicles (Liam Garrigan). Both have the hots for Princess Hebe (Gaia Weiss) but because the movie isnt ""The Legend of Iphicles"" its not hard to predict how things will wind up. Hercules gets sold into slavery and exiled to Egypt then essentially works as a gladiator to return to Greece. A pal helps him on his journey; ""Ill make you a guest of honor at the wedding"" Hercules exclaims. The dialogue rarely gets better than that. The films action sequences all land with a thud. Harlin constantly uses ""Matrix""-style slow-motion effects like a kid playing with a new toy. The CGI is unconvincing often bordering on the cartoonish and the 3-D prompts yawns. The whole thing is a total bore; even the supporting players arent motivated enough to attract attention. Thats good news for Lutz; he cant be blamed for torpedoing the project because everyone is doing subpar work here. Reach the reporter at randy.cordovaarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8849.

And although some of its more imaginative plot details would make Edith Hamilton blanch Renny Harlins Legend of Hercules fulfills every silly flimsy promise that it makes in the first place There are lots of battles (albeit rather jerkily rendered ones) some grand-looking horses decked out in handsome metal headdresses and lots of well-oiled beefcake. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - You could ask for more -- an actual script maybe? -- but Harlin covers most of the basics. Or perhaps more accurately he leaves them uncovered.Brawny Hercules (Kellan Lutz Emmett Cullen of the Twilight Saga) son of the comely Queen Alcmene (Roxanne McKee) is sent off to battle by the resentful man who is not his real father King Amphitryon (Scott Adkins).Film Details The Legend of Hercules RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time99 More Info Trailer Because the god Zeus as we know is Herculess real daddy which is even better than having Frank Sinatras DNA in your gene pool. Theres also a jealous half-brother Iphicles (Liam Garrigan) and a radiant willowy love interest Hebe (Gaia Weiss).Every actor muddles along valiantly with the movies stiff dialogue and most of them -- especially Australian Liam McIntyre who plays Herculess buddy Sotiris with an almost Shakespearean nobility -- get by. In fact of all of them Lutz has the smallest measure of screen presence He looks like a frat boy headed to a post-graduation job at Brown Brothers Harriman and his voice is less a mighty roar than a throaty croak. In the pectoral department however he does not disappoint. And if thats not at least part of what brings you to The Legend of Hercules well youre at the wrong movie.2 Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Stephanie Zacharek Follow szacharek Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

In the film Hercules falls in love with a princess who is engaged to his evil borhter Iphicles played by Liam Garrigan. (Summit Entertainment) By Stephanie Merry January 10 2014 Follow stephmerry When two similarly-themed movies come out in quick succession its usually better to be the first one out of the gate. In 2013 ""White House Down"" had better marketing a bigger budget and the Channing Tatum factor but it couldnt escape the shadow of the other terrorists-kidnap-the-president movie ""Olympus Has Fallen"" which came out a few months earlier and brought in more money domestically. But theres good news for Brett Ratner the director behind ""Hercules"" which comes out in July. Its hard to imagine that the summer blockbuster could be worse than ""The Legend of Hercules"" which should fade quickly into obscurity as so many January releases do. Dwayne Johnson who takes the title role in Ratners rendition has more charisma in one raised eyebrow than Kellan Lutz can muster during an entire pre-battle speech in ""The Legend of Hercules."" Lutz has the muscles to play the powerful demigod offspring of Zeus and the mortal queen Alcmene but he could have skipped a few grueling weight-lifting routines to take some acting lessons. In his defense the script does him no favors. The movie tells the creation story of Hercules as his mother falls out of love with her husband King Amphitryon (a spectacularly overacting Scott Adkins) and his warring ways and prays to Hera for peace. The goddess comes up with a plan which involves letting her husband the almighty Zeus sleep with Alcmene (Roxanne McKee) and father a child who shall bring peace to the land. This scheme leads to one of the most unintentionally funny sex scenes in memory as Alcmene is visited in her bed one night by the invisible god who expresses pleasure by mooing like a cow. But the meat of the story is this Hercules falls in love with a princess who is betrothed to his evil brother Iphicles (Liam Garrigan) and the equally vile King Amphitryon sends his supposed offspring to co-opt distant lands where certain death awaits him. Of course he doesnt die and he and another Greek Sotiris (Liam McIntyre) become best bros as they journey back to Argos to foil the nuptials that are to take place three moons hence. Recurring visions of the fake moon were just some of the moments that caused outbursts of incredulous laughter during a recent screening. Another such instance came when Hercules kills the Nemean lion a computer-generated monster that looks like an animatronic stuffed animal. Aside from bad dialogue and worse special effects one of the most frustrating features of ""Legend"" is its shortage of lingering shots. Quick cutting is an epidemic in modern movies but in this case when scenes end -- usually with some one-liner -- theres no time to process the words before were thrust into some new action. The movie is the cinematic equivalent of a run-on sentence that never pauses for a breather. It doesnt appear that a lot of time or effort was put into the script but with this kind of cutting director Renny Harlin (who also is one of the writers) makes clear what little value he places on words. Some of the fight scenes are genuinely exciting and McIntyre who clearly has acting ability well beyond this type of work manages to keep a straight face. But the only thing epic about ""The Legend of Hercules"" is what a failure it is. 1/2 star PG-13. At area theaters. Contains intense combat action violence and some sensuality. 99 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Director Renny Harlin (139) PG-13 Violence sexuality. Area theaters. Its amazing to think there were grown-ups behind the making of ""The Legend of Hercules."" This ludicrously written buffoonishly acted irritatingly filmed sword-and-sandals epic hasnt half the sand sweat or saltiness of other titles in the genre be they cult (""Hercules Unchained"" with Steve Reeves) curious (""Conan the Barbarian"" Sergio Leones ""The Colossus of Rhodes"") or acclaimed (""Gladiator""). Here we have Kellan Lutz -- aka one of The Other Guys in the ""Twilight"" saga -- as the grown son of Amphitryon (Scott Adkins) the warmongering king of Greece and a mom (Roxanne McKee) whose one night of passion with ""God of Gods"" Zeus resulted in Hercules whom she names Alcides to keep him safe. Yet as the kid hits 20 and cant be hurt defeated mom reveals his true nature to him. Hercs none too happy -- the big lugs lovelorn you see because his dad promised Hercs true love Hebe (rhymes with ""Jeebie"") daughter of the king of Crete to Hercs jealous pinched-face brother Iphicles. Hebe is played by Gaia Weiss a poor mans Keira Knightley. Iphicles by Liam Garrigan who mostly pretends hes Tom Hiddleston as Loki in the ""Thor"" movies. The Legend of Hercules wont join the pantheon of worthy sword-and-sandle flicks. (SIMON VARSANO) Those Marvel comic-book flicks must have been in the back of director Renny Harlins mind though its hard to tell what was in the front of it. As Herc is sent on a mission his father hopes hell die on the beefcake with the bread-basket breasts is taken hostage forced to fight gladiator battles against guys who look like refugees from ""The Road Warrior"" and pines for Hebe. All roads lead to dullness. The action photography stops and starts with herky-jerky slow-motion. During these mid-fight pauses poor Lutzs face is all screwed-up and toothy making him look a bit like Bugs Bunny. Then the videogame-inspired visuals - complete with junky 3D - get back to normal which is to say unexceptional. But no scene is safe from the slo-mo be it horseplay foreplay or lion-wrestle. The Twilight cant fight off a bad script in the Renny Harlin-directed stinker. (SIMON VARSANO) Herc makes it back to Greece rallies the people in a sloppy attempt at rebellion and accepts his half-God half-man status. Harlin who for the briefest of moments in 1990 likely thought the same thing about himself (His ""Die Hard 2"" and ""The Adventures of Ford Fairlane opened within a week of each other in July of that year) went on to make exactly one good movie (""Cliffhanger"") and here demonstrates that he can basically press ""Play"" and ""Pause"" on his Wii. ""The Legend of Hercules couldnt survive 5 minutes in an arena with ""Spartacus"" or ""Red Sonja"" for that matter. Its only saving grace may be that itll make director Brett Ratners ""Hercules"" due this summer and starring Dwayne (the Rock) Johnson look better. It cant look worse.

Still the film manages some nifty visuals and fight sequences that occasionally make you forget dialogue as rickety as a junk chariot.Kellan Lutz (Immortals the Twilight franchise) plays our title character the stepson of evil King Amphitryon (Scott Adkins). The ruler is a tyrant jealous of Hercs god-like DNA and determined to play favorites with his sniveling son Iphicles (Liam Garrigan).Adkins (Zero Dark Thirty The Expendables 2) stands out among a bland cast that does much bleeding shouting and flexing if little emoting. He gives the films first half-hour some crackle as he consolidates power by brokering a peace with neighboring Crete.Hercules may have inherited Zeus strength but he could have used some of stepdads fury. Lutz is a likable presence a grinning beefcake who has some of the easy charm of Chris Hemsworth star of the Thor franchise (another series that left its impression on director Renny Harlin).But Hercules needs presence to match his girth and hes such a sheepish hero that its hard to get that concerned with his battles across the Egyptian desert or his pining for the love of his life Princess Hebe (Gaia Weiss).Credit Harlin (Cliffhanger Die Hard 2) with passable action scenes accentuated by 3-D. The stylized slow-motion violence comes straight from the 300 playbook though its watered down to maintain a PG-13 rating.And theres a fun retro camp to Hercules with nods to classics such as Ben-Hur and Spartacus as Hercules finds himself rowing slave ships and crossing desert expanses.But this is mythology-light geared for kids who dont have time for Wikipedia. Our stars are buff beautiful and wise-cracking. And theres not much in the way of tension Pitting Hercules against mortal Romans is like an arm-wrestling match between Clark Kent and a real reporter.Still Hercules makes no bones about being being anything more than popcorn fare and manages to tell a passable story however puny. 30 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDIN 7 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1eKHIse",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/01/10/legend-of-hercules-review/4403799/,200,thelegendofhercules8,thelegendofhercules,usatoday

Photo Credit MCT advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The origin story of the Greek demigod. Rated PG-13. BOTTOM LINE This painfully feeble version of the strongman story fails on every level from Lutzs wooden acting to the styrofoam special effects. At least thats one less sequel to worry about. CAST Kellan Lutz Gaia Weiss Scott Adkins LENGTH 139 Come back Taylor Kitsch ""John Carter"" is forgiven thanks to the Kellan Lutz vehicle ""The Legend of Hercules."" Lutz the fashion model and actor best known as the strapping Emmett Cullen in the ""Twilight"" franchise takes the title role in ""The Legend of Hercules"" a movie so gruelingly terrible it makes the 2012 bomb ""John Carter"" look like 1960s ""Spartacus."" Lutzs performance is so wooden he makes Kitsch look like Kirk Douglas. Lutz isnt solely to blame but its difficult to pinpoint what exactly makes ""Hercules"" so awful. Each aspect of this movie seems magically worse than all the others. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Its presented as an origin story of the demigod strongman Hercules the product of a quickie between Queen Alcmene (Roxanne McKee) and Zeus. Why the heartless King Amphitryon (Scott Adkins) raises Hercules alongside his own son Iphicles (Liam Garrigan) isnt clear especially since hes later willing to send him on a fatal military mission to Egypt. Hercules survives however hoping to return and claim the hand of Hebe (Gaia Weiss). ""The Legend of Hercules"" is a swords-and-sandals epic retrofitted for the modern superhero era and nothing about it jibes. Director Renny Harlin who in the 1990s turned out fine popcorn flicks like ""Die Hard 2"" and ""Cliffhanger"" seems to be grabbing at various styles the craggy landscapes and lusty speeches of ""Clash of the Titans"" the treacherous brother-figure from ""Thor"" the slow-mo fight sequences of ""The Matrix."" At times the cliches become self-parody One idyllic love scene is filled with so much floating sun-dappled pollen that the actors nearly disappear. With a dearth of memorable dialogue interesting characters and decent acting (Lutzs pectorals can fill a screen but they unfortunately cant overdub his lines) the only remaining reason for this film to exist would seem to be the special effects. These too are bad. At one point Hercules flings around two giant chunks of stone that look as light as Styrofoam (odd since theyre actually made of pixels). Its as good a metaphor for this hollow movie as any. 215 MoviesThe Legend of Hercules trailer PLOT The origin story of the Greek demigod. advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING PG-13 CAST Kellan Lutz Gaia Weiss Scott Adkins LENGTH 139 BOTTOM LINE This painfully feeble version of the strongman story fails on every level from Lutzs wooden acting to the Styrofoam special effects.

Renny Harlin was one of the signal action auteurs of the nineties with such disposably stylish fun movies asA The Long Kiss Goodnight Deep Blue Sea and Cliffhanger (his masterpiece). Rambling yet irreverent these were decadent action epics that somehow never took themselves seriously. Because action to one side Harlin could also do comedy and his timing was often impeccable. Think of John Lithgows goofy bad guy in Cliffhanger or the unforgettable scene where Samuel L. Jackson gets eaten in Deep Blue Sea. But the director never could do romance. To his credit he rarely tried aside from the abortive Geena Davis-Matthew Modine love story in Cutthroat Island. So naturally Harlins new film The Legend of Hercules has zero humor and lots of romance. Starring second-string Twilight hunk Kellan Lutz as the legendary Greek demigod/hero Hercules refashions the myth into a tale of love thwarted. Changing the Hercules story is nothing new since the classic version of the tale is a downer involving him killing his own children. This time around Hercules the illegitimate child of queen Alcmene of Tiryns (Roxanne McKee) and Zeus (Factory VFX) is set up and sent off on a purposely ill-fated mission by his foster father King Amphitryon (the never-not-intense Scott Adkins). Hercules dreams of getting back home not to rule or take revenge but to claim the hand of his lover Princess Hebe (Gaia Weiss). She in turn is also coveted by his dastardly neurotic older brother Iphicles (Liam Garrigan) the legitimate child of the brutal Amphitryon and the long-suffering Alcmene. Thats a lot of love triangle but the acting is so wooden and the interactions between Hebe and Hercules so unimaginative (basically he just shows her how strong he is) that we never really buy any of it. Everybody seems to have been cast based on their ability to either stare blankly or to scream often at the heavens. The film then settles into a cross between Gladiator and the Christ tale as Hercules is ambushed sold into slavery competes his way back to Greece and once back in his kingdom becomes a kind of renegade savior for his long-suffering people with weirdly Christian overtones. (""Your father has always been there you were just not ready for him"" an angel a servant tells him at one point.) The only one of Herculess mythical labors that we see this one accomplish is the slaying of the Nemean Lion early on. A shame because I was looking forward to seeing Kellan Lutz clean some stables. Yes yes but hows the action? Its predictably stylish -- Harlin has clearly put his DVD of 300 to good use -- but in a thoroughly hollow way. He goes wild with speed-ramping which is useful for anyone who wants to more closely examine the slo-mo man-meat on display but as a way of creating excitement its a bust. The 3-D though is effective The film throws lots of things in our face -- arrows swords spears bulging arms etc. -- without forsaking clarity. But its hard to care about action scenes when you know whos going to win every single time. More important its hard to care about action scenes when theres nothing worthwhile at stake. Lutzs complete lack of charisma is certainly part of the problem Hes got shoulders that seem to stretch on for infinity but his face only registers a couple of emotions. He seems frankly out of his element. Thats not so bad for his early scenes where he has to play a naive trusting figure but later on his limited range starts to wear on us. At the very least you wish hed have fun with the part. Theres little humor in the script but theres potential for humor in the visuals At one unintentionally goofy point Hercules whips an army with two giant chunks of pillars tied to chains; later he whips them with a thunderbolt. I kept wondering what a young pre-crazy Mel Gibson might have done with scenes like that maybe playing up the slapstick aspect of it. But like so many of todays action films The Legend of Hercules is too busy peddling slick stone-faced portent to ever bother making us laugh or engaging us in any way.

A cash in sure. But in an effort to strip the Greek myth of any ""silliness"" --displays of uber-strength and the man-on-monster beatdowns one might expect from the mythical guy who bested Eurystheus Twelve Labours -- writers Sean Hood and Daniel Giat turn ol Herc into Beefcake Jesus (actor Kellan Lutz) a savior of the people challenged by his own godliness. ""Legend of Hercules"" is a companion piece to ""The Bible"" mini-series in both tone and scope; sporadic action breaks up endless amounts of epic speak gobbledygook the whole thing packaged with CG surroundings that wouldnt pass as Lord of the Rings animatics. When Hercules finally embraces his heritage finally Hulks out with a lightning sword the welcome absurdity is too little too late. ""I Claudius"" has bigger thrills then this would-be tentpole. ""The Legend of Hercules"" invests in drama that it clearly has no interest in exploring. A political threat to his father King Amphitryon (the mighty Scott Adkins) and just too damn heart-throbby for his older brother Iphicles (Liam Garrigan) to bear Hercules is sentenced to life on the front lines the fastest way to a stint in the gladiator arena -- and the grave. But Hercules is driven to stay alive in hopes of returning to his blonde gal pal Hebe (Gaia Weiss) slaying his horny bro and freeing the background extras from a run time over 90 minutes. Before he owns the mantle of ""Zeus Son"" Hercules is a warrior of unimaginable force. After he remains infallible with the added bonus of picking up rocks and hurling them at bad guys. It might not seem so stagnant if Lutz could turn Hercules into anything beyond a anthropomorphic sack of t-bone steaks. In ""Legend"" hes a cross between Rocky Horror and Weird Als spoof of Kurt Cobain; its edge-of-your-seat entertainment waiting to see if marbles spill out of Lutzs mouth. The actor can hold while duking it out with his roided-out opponents (enhanced by a lions roar that bellows out of Hercules mouth whenever he screams) but ""Legend"" is a movie of walk-and-talks and Lutzs jaw muscle isnt ripped enough to do the heavy-lifting. ""Legend of Hercules"" lacks that pillar of gravitas a casting choice like Liam Neeson in ""Clash of the Titans"" or John Hurt in ""Immortals"" designed to chew up scenery when the picture cant find the money to stuff in another action set piece. Hollywoods favorite Euro-Russian Rade Serbedzija appears briefly as Hercules guidance counselor Chiron a disposable exposition-barfing side player who the writers cant even throw a delicious monologue or two despite the films dialogue requirements. To kill time ""Legend"" doughnuts around the parking lot returning over and over to Amphitryon and Iphicles empty threats and Hercules wake-up-already journey to understanding. Theres no reason Herclues shouldnt understand that hes not a demigod but if he just wont have it then hey thats a dramatic thrust. Adkins and Garrigan are staple villains for Herc to pursue adding to the films been-there-done-that stench. Surprisingly Harlin who has been forced to sink his teeth into TV and direct-to-DVD actioners after a string of bombs makes the most of his meager budget and scrapbooked script. The guy has an eye for bombastic set-driven action on full display when Hercules finally gets around to encountering his father. Cutting through 21st century stylistic tropes (which feel like demands to be worked around) Harlin opens up the fight scenes zips to the right angles at the right moments and delivers actual brutality. Lutz and Adkins dont need to be hidden by shaky cam and hyper-editing; they come alive with the choreography. Harlin takes the same approach with the fantastical elements; in one moment Hercules is weaponized with stone pillars on chains bashing soldiers to thunderous accompaniment. While the art of action filmmaking depreciates Harlin remains steadfast in his classicism even if the movie doesnt have the foundation to support him. Someone throw this guy ""Thor 3"" Judging from the production design costumes and post-production crafts ""Legend of Hercules"" didnt have the pockets to be ambitious. Talk of quarreling armies and godly interference are undermined by the suffocating scale (somehow half-baked CG backgrounds still dont a candle to good ol fashioned matte paintings). Theres nothing mythic about this ""Hercules."" The filmmaking seems all too aware of that fact.

A towering figure of Greek mythology the half-human half-god strong man Hercules has always been something of a schlock icon where movies are concerned from the wave of Italian-made sword-and-sandal cheapies that broke upon these shores in the 1950s and 60s to their 1980s Cannon Films derivants starring Lou Ferrigno. The song remains very much the same for ""The Legend of Hercules"" the first of two dueling 2014 tentpoles to reach theaters and every inch the one that might have been commissioned by the late impresario Alexander Salkind in his ""Santa Claus The Movie"" period. Costly in price (75 million) but totally kitsch in execution from its wooden dialogue to its low-rent international cast and its very CG-looking CGI ""Legend"" is ideal fodder for undiscriminating 12-year-old boys on a lazy weekend afternoon though even they may opt to wait for the Rock in MGM/Paramounts Brett Ratner-directed ""Hercules"" due in July. As with last summers Beltway demolition derby of ""Olympus Has Fallen"" and ""White House Down"" the canny B-movie magnate Avi Lerner (who produced through his Millennium Films banner) is once again betting that the early bird will catch the box office worm. But lacking ""Olympus"" star wattage and facing stiff competition from Christmas season holdovers ""Legend"" will be hard-pressed to match its predecessors commercial heft. Still the movie is not without its incidental pleasures -- chiefly a 90-minute running time (sans credits) that alone makes it preferable to the bloated spectacle of ""47 Ronin."" Back at the helm of a large-scale action picture for the first time since his Sylvester Stallone auto-racing turkey ""Driven"" in 2001 Renny Harlin kicks things off with a thunderous battle scene in which hordes of CG warriors under the command of the Tirynthean King Amphitryon (Scott Adkins) storm the gates of neighboring Argos circa 1200 B.C. 3D arrows raining down on the audience in old-fashioned comin-at-ya style. But while Amphitryon is an undisputed victor on the battlefield we soon see that things havent been kosher for a while between him and his beleaguered wife Queen Alcmene (Roxanne McKee) who longs for peace in their war-torn land. Having exhausted all other options she prays to the goddess Hera for help and receives a surprising response It seems that Heras s.o. Zeus has always coveted Alcmene from afar and if Alcmene agrees to let him sire her child that boy Hercules will lead his people to salvation. (Lurking around the edges of these early scenes is Rade Serbedzija as the queens Gandalf-like mentor Chiron.) This leads to a conception scene that resembles a cross between an expensive perfume ad and an exorcism -- all thunder lightning and billowing curtains -- which probably explains why Amphitryon suspects something foul from the start and vows to always treat this bastard son whom he christens Alcides as inferior to his firstborn Iphicles. The pic then flashes forward 20 years where we find the bronzed and bulgingly muscular Alcides (Kellan Lutz) in love with the Cretan princess Hebe (the blankly beautiful Gaia Weiss) and openly loathed by both Amphitryon and Iphicles (Liam Garrigan) who fancies Hebe for himself. So the king and his heir apparent plot to rid Alcides from the picture by sending him off to war -- and certain death -- in Egypt. If ""The Legend of Hercules"" takes most of its visual cues from ""300"" and the ""Lord of the Rings"" series (albeit without anywhere near the same level of seamless craftsmanship) it borrows most of its narrative beats from ""Gladiator"" following Alcides/Hercules on his journey into the bowels of slavery his discovery of his true parentage and god-like abilities and his return home to confront his betrayers. Along the way the movie happens upon its two most engaging episodes -- one a close-quarters ambush in an Egyptian cave that leaves Hercules and fellow soldier Sotiris (Liam McIntyre) the only survivors the other a Sicily-set gladiatorial bout in which Hercules squares off against a giant mutant known fittingly as Half Face. Both serve as reminders that Harlin can still execute a solid action sequence with an attention to perspective and spatial continuity that many of his contemporaries lack even if hes a bit too fond of freeze-frames and slow-motion that threaten to trun every fight scene into its own instant replay. But ""Hercules"" sinks into torpor whenever something other than hand-to-hand combat takes centerstage. As he demonstrated in the ""Twilight"" series Lutzs acting muscles arent nearly as well developed as his pectorals and deltoids and while the role may not call for a master thespian it at least begs someone who can emote without looking like hes straining to execute a deadlift. Relative newcomer McIntyre who assumed the lead role in ""Spartacus"" on TV from the late Andy Whitfield gives by far the most affecting and nuanced turn here as a man driven to extraordinary lengths by the hope of someday reuniting with his family. Shot in Bulgaria (where Millennium now has its own studio) ""Legend"" isnt as distractingly cheap looking as other Lerner productions with decent set and costume work though the CGI is always more high-end videogame than anything approaching photorealism. Sam McCurdys 3D camerawork is mostly effective but was marred at the screening reviewed by the conspicuous dimness that afflicts so much 3D projection.

Diane Holder says January 13 2014 at 352 pm You really have to work very very had to make a bad Scifi/Fantasy movie. Some of the really bad ones that dont take themselves to seriously can become cult classics. Expectations tend to be so low that so long as you have good actions scenes and a reasonably good story one can still enjoy even a bad Scifi/Fantasy movie. This one was really bad taking itself too seriously to become a cult classic but so bad that you cant even just sit back and enjoy the action. At one point I said to myself ""I thought that was Samson not Hercules? "" and ""Are we really back to movies defining the good characters with blond hair and the bad ones with black hair?"" and ""I could walk out but there is hope this could get better"" to (and I know that I have reached the point of no return when I hope the heroes/heroines die) ""Oh please just jump..drat he saved her"".

TWITTER Directed by Renny Harlin Millennium Entertainments epic stars Kellan Lutz as the son of Zeus. If the strapping but hardly muscle-bound lead actor in The Legend of Hercules Kellan Lutz were to engage in hand-to-hand combat with the star of this summers Hercules Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson the fight would likely be over in less than a minute. Along the same lines Brett Ratners MGM/Paramount epic due in July would have to be very bad indeed to feel threatened by Renny Harlins quarter-pounder layered with many slices of cheese. Just as it did last year when it rushed Olympus Has Fallen into the marketplace three months before the far more expensive and starry White House Down -- to the latters commercial detriment -- Millennium Films is trying to steal the bigger films thunder with a cut-rate version of the same thing. But this first major release of 2014 functions only to help insure that this January will be no different from Januaries past as the customary worst month of the year for new movies. PHOTOS The Redemption of Brett Ratner Photos of the Hercules Helmer Although it clearly aspires to the 300 style of hyper-inflated attenuated action this Bulgaria-shot pseudo-epic is marked by CGI sequences so patently phony particularly toward the beginning that it could often be mistaken for a mediocre animated film rather than live action an affliction only magnified by the arbitrary and unimaginative use of 3D. A lion wrestled by the hero into submission early on is so fake looking that it would appear more at home on a childrens cartoon show. Nor does the script by Sean Hood and Daniel Giat have much to do with the more commonly known aspects of the Hercules mythology such as the famous twelve labors. Rather it quite optimistically positions itself as a sort-of origins story cursorily charting early adventures of its hero by making liberal use of scenes and situations from famous films about antiquity; among those sampled are Ben-Hur (the captive hero being put to work as a boat rower) Gladiator (his enslavement only redeemable in the arena) and Spartacus (the prisoner rising up to lead a mass revolt against the barbarous regime). And going very much against the grain this Hercules is portrayed as a one-woman man a fellow whose fighting spirit is roused principally by the fear that if he doesnt get back to Greece from Egypt within three moons his modelish blond girlfriend Hebe (Gaia Weiss) will marry his treacherous rival. VIDEO The Legend of Hercules Trailer 2 If The Legend of Hercules were just a little more inept or over-the-top it might have been ridiculous fun. As it is unfortunately Harlin embraces the mediocrity of the screenplay with a dour straight face draining it of any enjoyably camp possibilities. He also covers and edits sequences in arbitrary ways that betray no awareness of how to present much less build scenes dramatically. Nor is there a sensibility here with any evident sympatico for the epic format. When Argos is overrun in 1200 B.C. Amphitryon (Scott Adkins nothing if not intense) takes over as king and takes the queen Alcmene (Roxanne McKee giving a lonely good performance) as his own. Sympathetic to her plight the great Zeus impregnates her in order to sire a hero who may two decades hence avenge his mother. Just after the birth Amphitryon is informed that Alcmene has had ""a large boy."" Large he is so much so that once he turns twenty theres not enough room in town for him and Amphitryons yellow-bellied son and designated successor Iphicles (Liam Garrigan). Taken prisoner in an Egyptian cave after a battle Hercules and his cohort Sotiris (appealing Liam McIntyre the last Spartacus on TV) in a rush to get home hustle a fight-game entrepreneur (Kenneth Cranham as a poor cousin to Peter Ustinov in the film Spartacus) to pit them in long-odds combat concluding in a homecoming match in which Hercules takes on six of Greeces finest fighting men. Even when Hercules seems to incur injuries they dont slow him down or cause any real damage; it must be that god gene. But even the fight and battle scenes are unexciting because theyre bogus contrived and derivative; are we supposed to ooh and aah at twists and turns and stutter-action moves that began seeming old a year after The Matrix came out and have been outdone by countless video games? The productions scale like everything else is unimpressive. About the only line that gets a good laugh comes late on when the Herculess legend leads to shock and awe among downtrodden peasants and besieged villagers when they actually see him. ""Is it true you are Hercules the god?"" a man inquires. ""No Im just a man"" comes the reply. Hes also the star of two movies this year at least one of them lousy.
