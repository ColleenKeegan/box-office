Plus Were the Millers comes close and The Canyons crash-lands. by Wesley Morris on August 8 2013 Elysium is a smart handsome severely conscientious intermittently entertaining diversion that wants you to think without having to overthink to feel but not too much to achieve timeliness without you looking down at your watch. It wants you to be irate at such abstract injustices as social and economic inequality while perhaps not noticing that the movie itself is situated upon a version of that very imbalance. Its adventurous and aggravatingly conventional at the same time full of both allegorical ideas about revolution and cute kids pulling at the coattails of grown men. The writer and director Neill Blomkamp seems sad having to set to his movie in the Los Angeles of the future in a 2154 thats dusty and dehydrated strewn with trash and debris and graffiti. He seems sad that he has to make this movie that we still arent the world. Hes crying Why arent we? In Elysium everyone is Latin off-Latin or Boerish. More than once the camera floats up above the earth and gives you dilapidated shacks for as far as the eye can see. It looks like Soweto or parts of Rio de Janeiro on infinite repeat. In the opening minutes titles explain that those images stand in for the entire planet which is ""diseased polluted and vastly overpopulated."" They tell us that the wealthy -- whites and one Indian president whos revealed to be virtually powerless -- have decamped to a not-too-distant spoked wheel called Elysium which hangs mockingly visible from the streets of Los Angeles like an astral hood ornament. The people of L.A. stagnate while residents of the synthetically verdant-looking wheel resemble figures in most architecture mockups. Rebellious Angelenos hop into spaceships that speed up toward the wheel only to have its defense secretary -- the steely owner of a platinum-blonde bob named Delacourt whos played by Jodie Foster -- arrange to shoot them down. Madame Secretary phones down to L.A. and instructs a vicious (and viciously bearded) military agent called Kruger (Sharlto Copley) to launch guided missiles at the so-called illegals. Its strange that she hasnt found a way to weaponize her haircut. At least two of the invaders of Delacourts air space -- a Latina and her ill daughter -- wanted access to a bed that heals the sick simply by scanning the body. Its a device even more sophisticated than the more gruesomely depicted versions in Prometheus and The Wolverine. In less than 20 minutes Elysium presents itself as a movie depressed about socioeconomic wrongs that the poor live in City of God and the rich live in a land whose theme music is ""Pachelbels Canon."" How does anyone down there successfully get up there? Blomkamp presents a young laborer named Max Da Costa as a possible bridge. Max was raised by Spanish-speaking nuns one of whom tells him in a childhood flashback ""You will do something important."" (Yes like grow up to look like Matt Damon) His Max is a poor ex-con factory worker accosted and attacked by robocops who target him because perhaps hes the only white guy in sight. He must be guilty of something. Indeed Max cant catch a break unless of course the break is of his arm. In the hospital his boyhood friend Frey (Alice Braga) happens to be both his nurse and a lifelong crush. She accepts a date but before love can happen Max suffers a terrible workplace disaster that leaves him fatally radioactive and suddenly of interest to a band of radical illegals led by Wagner Moura whove been trying to make it to Elysium. The plan to get there -- so Max can hop into one of those health-reversal machines -- requires both surgery for a neurally interfaced exoskeleton and stealing from an Elysium citizen (in this case a powerful CEO played by William Fichtner who happens to also have very important codes that a power-mad Delacourt desperately wants). Blomkamp has overwritten this movie -- Frey has a daughter with leukemia; would Max please please get her to Elysium too? -- but you watch curious about where hell take it and you and these actors. Damon doesnt have far to go. Hes given some tattoos and dangerous backstory but hes playing a saint and as fearless as hes become as an actor this is not a part that asks him to put much on the line. Thats fine but once the movie has offered another flashback or plea for pity on Maxs behalf you know that Blomkamp could have made this movie with just about any actor. He doesnt need a star to propel the material. Damon is as much a hood ornament as Elysium is. Meanwhile Foster attacks her scenes with a kind of menace -- Blomkamp encourages her to use French as a typical demonstration of exclusive refinement and to speak English with a kind of vaguely British hardness. Its as if Blomkamp took the movie away before Foster finished figuring out her performance. At least once her lips are moving in the opposite direction of her dialogue. Is the character malfunctioning or is the actor? The movie also has a thankless part for Diego Luna and Braga a Brazilian who was in City of God seems stuck as the restorative sci-fi love interest -- as she was in I Am Legend and Repo Men. She might be a terrific actress but if this is all Hollywood will let her do -- flinty girlfriend-mothers -- I dont think I can watch. Its Moura whos the best thing in this movie but he does so much barking that at some point what youre really admiring is his vocal stamina. Blomkamps previous film District 9 from four years ago was a more explicit if more obvious science-fiction apartheid allegory (it was set in the South African townships). There the non-whites were literal aliens called ""prawns"" who were bound to shanties and chronically persecuted. Mostly the story (an inspired act of empathy) concerned the mutation of a white bureaucrat played by Copley from person to prawn. In Elysium surgery turns Max into a ghetto-deluxe prawn metallic and full of USB ports. (One character calls him a favela ninja. Im calling him the Toxic Avenger.) Blomkamp at the moment is neither a dramatist nor -- despite whatever it is that Copley is doing in his films -- a natural comedian. He was born in 1973 grew up white in apartheid-era Johannesburg and has opted for moralist action spectacles. Elysium seizes on the more global woe of apartheid but Blomkamp doesnt give any specificity to his sense of injustice. The movie is political without ever risking being mistaken for a polemic. Theres a desert brawl at the films midway point and some climactic combat up on Elysium thats set in the same kind of power plant/science laboratory as a lot of the rest of these movies -- Star Trek Into Darkness and The Wolverine being two recent examples. (So much thought has gone into how Elysium should look that the film seems terrified to touch anything. This place is the production-design equivalent of your grandmothers plastic-encased couch no spills.) Any thematic audacity is snuffed out by action sequences that you can now buy at Dollar General. What also are we to do with the many flashbacks to when Max and Frey were young and with the scenes in which Freys little girl addresses Max with a parable or the audience with her sad-puppy face? Is this a work of empathy or outrage or guilt? Its too vague about too much to know for sure. Blomkamp recently told Entertainment Weekly that he dislikes the science fiction label. This movie is now he said meaning that setting Elysium in 2154 is what? A red herring? A marketing ploy? An excuse to spend a lot of money? Obviously he meant that the film cant be dismissed as mere science fiction. Hes going after the 1 percent. Hes going after government neglect and venality. Apparently hes also going after the Tijuana police who not long ago nabbed Blomkamp on the U.S.-Mexico border and dropped him and a producer in the middle of nowhere. This time alas its personal -- and yet not nearly enough. Blomkamp is also going after other movies ones starring Charlton Heston say. Theres also George Millers Mad Max trilogy John Carpenters Escape From ... films and the museum-ready miserablism of Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu. If you saw Oblivion from the spring with Tom Cruise and remember it youll know where Elysium wants to tread and youll ask whether a better less biblical solution was available. If Blomkamp is mad as hell thats not what you feel. You feel marketplace concerns. Crazier guns More evil Copley to shoot and be shot at Blomkamp is a talented loosely visionary director but after two movies it appears to be a limited vision. Hes stuck between real rebellion and real marketability. So the new movie is a mess of violence and parental devotional but rarely at the same time. Depending on the audience one is meant to make the other palatable. And Damon is here to make Elysium palatable to everyone. If youre TriStar Pictures some delicacy might be in order. Maybe you dont want your socioeconomic-justice action blockbuster to pit a Braga or Luna or Kerry Washington or Will Smith alone against Planet Country Club. You dont want your first movie out of the gate to look like a race riot. But you cant help but wonder whether some people will see Damon anointed the chosen one while surrounded by indigent affronted capable brown people and think We dont need another hero. People are really laughing at Were the Millers. I told a friend after I saw it a couple nights ago that I didnt find it that funny. ""OMG youre crazy"" she said. ""Different strokes"" she went on praying for my soul. The movie has Jennifer Aniston Jason Sudeikis Emma Roberts and Will Poulter as four lowlifes who fake being a family to smuggle drugs from Mexico to the U.S. in an RV. Sudeikiss character needs a bigger dealer (Ed Helms hopefully doing a parody of Ed Helms) to forgive his debt. So he recruits Aniston who has quit her job as a stripper and needs to pay her rent; Roberts who needs to stay out of trouble; and virginal Poulter who wants to get into some. There are several run-ins with a Christian family in an RV headed by Kathryn Hahn and Nick Offerman. One encounter happens inside a tent and culminates with Hahns hands on Anistons breasts. Theres a beat missing in this movie. I wasnt sure what it was and then Aniston and Roberts show Poulter how to kiss in the RV. The scene works because it builds to a punch line that you can see coming but whose arrival you dread. The director Rawson Marshall Thurber keeps an increasingly dazed Poulter oscillating between the younger woman and other older one between the mother and the daughter so long that its funny. The movie thinks it has anarchic spirit but only in that scene is it real. True comedic anarchy for this movie requires the phony family to subvert real family values without winking at us. Aniston and Roberts get so much pleasure out of showing Poulter what to do with his tongue -- not sexual pleasure but the maternal and filial satisfaction of imparting a lesson to a son or a brother. And Poulter who was so good as a tween Brit filmmaker in Son of Rambow has a great American accent and deserves a movie of his own cant process the lessons fast enough. Thurber (Dodgeball A True Underdog Story) tries to make a farce out of a script credited to four writers (Bob Fisher Steve Faber Sean Anders and John Morris) but the comedy comes sporadically. He oversees a good bit with some Mexican stowaways at the border checkpoint but too much of the movie feels compromised. At some point Pretty Woman comes up in relation to Anistons character whos not -- so not she doth protest -- a prostitute and you remember that that movie was once a downer that became a Garry Marshall upper. Were the Millers also feels as if it began as a much darker film and was gradually lightened up by a fear of going too far. Instead the movies lingering close-ups on yearning faces and heart-to-heart conversations force the fake Millers into real familial longing thats more bogus than the family itself. But nobodys laughing at that. Theyre laughing at Aniston doing an Im-still-hot-dammit striptease that is not her finest comedic (or kinetic) moment. Theyre cracking up at the big furry spider that bites Poulter on the nuts and make his eyes go as big as his swollen scrotum. That stuff brings down the house. But I must have been Buster Keaton because the house came down around me. As meek as Elysium and Were the Millers might be neither is the embarrassment of bashfulness that is The Canyons a Los Angeles sex movie directed by Paul Schrader written by Bret Easton Ellis and starring Lindsay Lohan and the prolific adult-movie actor James Deen. No one here risks enough to achieve disaster. Its worse than that. It believes its taking risks it actually has no interest in taking that its seeing profundity in the showbiz shallows. Lohan and Deen are a couple festering with distrust. Hes some kind of movie producer who thinks shes banging the lead (Nolan Gerard Funk) in his upcoming movie because she is. How long until he calls her on it? How long until she concedes? How long until one of the actors does some acting? Lohan languishes and broods and lashes out. As a screen presence she has become a spectacle of ruined glory like the dilapidated movie palaces in the vacuous montage that opens the film. You trust in powers that she has yet to use as though playing Elizabeth Taylor in that terrible TV astonishment has nonetheless imbued her with Taylors stature. This must be what a fool believes since dialogue like ""Im really sorry I havent congratulated you on starting your own PR company"" are scarcely ""Mama face it. I was the slut of all time."" No man who once wrote a novel as lyrical and lacerating as The Rules of Attraction should ever admit to having written this. In some of the lighting and music cues you can feel the movie straining to evoke doom and the ominous atmosphere and erotic saturation of David Lynch whos an obvious point of reference (so for me were Henry Jaglom and Alan Rudolph). If Lynch specializes in movie-minded fun houses and sublimated waste The Canyons is unsalvageable rubbish. Schrader is no dummy though. Hes a brilliant intellectual director who perhaps was looking for the easy hit hes never had. This is all highly watchable but so are fires car crashes and humping dogs. Very few of Schraders artistic ideas about sex and masculinity come through this time only Lohans orchestration of some homoeroticism during a Christmas-lit four-way. Every scene here has the potential to be taken to some higher power the way Lynch used the knowingly terrible first half of Mulholland Drive as a portal to the hallelujahs of the second. There are moments in this film that imply that Schrader is looking for somewhere to hang his artistic hat and the only hook he can find is Deens cock.

Credit Michael Tackett/Warner Bros. In Theaters Wednesday August 7/4 You know youre in for a delightfully off-kilter comedy when Jennifer Aniston -- as a small-fry stripper -- writhes around a pole in lingerie and a wig within the first five minutes. After putting her clothes back on shes persuaded (er bribed) by her pot-dealing neighbor Jason Sudeikis to take an RV to Mexico and smuggle weed back to the U.S. His reasoning? If they pose as suburbanites on a road trip nobody at the border will be suspicious. (Emma Roberts and Will Poulter round out the ""family."") PHOTOS Jennifer Anistons on-set PDA Naturally there are roadblocks galore on their journey home -- but the breezy film stays one mile ahead in terms of plot and punch lines. It helps that Sudeikis has an appealing smarminess about him as he name-drops Dexter and Pretty Woman and Wiki-searches ""drug smuggling"" on his smartphone. PHOTOS Jennifer Anistons hair through the years His snappy SNL-honed delivery meshes well with Aniston. At age 44 she gives her teen ""son"" French-kissing lessons then performs a Flashdance-style dance to stymie drug goons. This is easily some of her best comedic work since Friends. Speaking of which Stay for the credits There will be clapping.

I cant think of another half-decent explanation for her desperate-looking strip tease half-way through Were the Millers (no nothing to do with the plot). Aniston is Rose a stripper who reluctantly agrees to help her drug-dealer neighbour (Jason Sudeikis) smuggle marijuana over the border from Mexico. Their high-risk strategy is to go deep undercover - disguised as wholesome midwestern American tourists. A couple of delinquent teenagers (Emma Roberts and Will Poulter) are roped into playing their fake kids. Theyre the Millers. This could have been so much funnier. The Millers act is going great guns until they meet the genuine article on the road a Bible-bashing family in beige slacks and fanny packs. But with jokes cloned from bad taste movies (the lamest of all is when Poulter gets bitten on the balls by a tarantula) and off-kids-telly villains it doesnt even qualify for dumb fun.

Mostly critics nerds whose lame job is watching movies and reviewing them but never a creator or contributor of films at any rate. Just like what an ornothologist does for the birds. Movie is witty and hilarious satire. Therere some parts I dont like but overall great. And for those who say this movie is predictable try to be honest with yourselves next time. As for your not having much humor sense I doubt youre gonna catch up with Emma Roberts wits or Jasons. Bitch please. To the reviewer 2 comments below mine what comedies are you talking about exactly? Critics are prone to like incredibly shitty movies. By far their favorites are L.A. Confidential a Streetcar named desire and in 2013 the hunger games catching fire. This highly verify them as pretentious boring fucks.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 3 2014ChaisFeaturedAlthough inappropriate on several occasions this movie was hilarious from beginning to end.

Therefore I dropped a starHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreDec 27 2013lettyFeaturedThis films biggest issue was that it was disgustingly boring. It was predictable and you could forsee exactly what would happen next because its full of tired jokes other comedies have done much better and for at least the past decade. It tried to be all edgy what with Anistons awful stripping (it was like watching a stick-man animation- it was just stiff and awkward and I understood why they cut away from her amazing dance mentioned at the start of the film) and what not but truth was it was cheesy (and not in the goodfun way.) They tried to have this cynical family guy-esque humour that just falls flat and as the other characters are pretty nice just makes the main cast dislikeable and you dont want them to win. The cast were decent but completely wasted. The storyline was lazy and the jokes lame and grating.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreDec 26 2013ikeFeaturedTanorexic mom no seatbelts ever used in the RV but the other couple wore them.

Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreSep 1 2013Matt on the TyneFeaturedThis is an extremely funny film and had me in tears of laughter at times. Thats all you really need to know if what you want is pure entertainment. In terms of plot and characterisation I would have to say that it does slip up a few times with the story taking its course in ways that stretch your suspension of disbelief beyond all credible limits. Theres the way the foursome first physically join up as a group which seems scarcely practicable; theres how they reunite at one point in a way that depends on one of them acting in an inexplicably out-of-character way; theres also the stupidity beyond words of the son of the family in a pivotal scene. I also have trouble with the concept of Jennifer Aniston (aged well over 40) being a stripper even though she is still very attractive. The laughter isnt constant sometimes making way for sentimentality or unremarkable plot twists. But these are just quibbles. Its very funny a lot of the time in places eye-wateringly so. A good watch.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreAug 30 2013Annabelle FeaturedThis is a great film - theres plenty to laugh about its quite gentle and fun.

"Were the Millers - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire Were the Millers Posted by Christy Lemire on August 10 2013 1 Comment Warner Bros. Pictures Rated R for crude sexual content passive language drug material and brief graphic nudity. Running time 110 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four. Jennifer Aniston is beautiful and stylish and envied with her trend-setting hair and yoga-toned body and the ability to achieve longevity in a fickle industry with her girl-next-door likability. But man is she terrible at picking movie roles. For the most part that is. When shes dared to go small and dark in indie dramas -- as a miserable store clerk in 2002s ""The Good Girl"" or a miserable maid in 2006s ""Friends With Money"" -- shes gotten a chance to stretch and flex and its been exciting to watch. Who knew that was in her all this time when she was playing girlfriends and wives and magical women who make things better for the men in their lives? I actually had to go onto IMDb just now to remind myself what ""Love Happens"" was. Thats how forgettably bland some of her big-studio choices have been. All of which makes her performance in ""Were the Millers"" so welcome and so refreshing for its dirtiness. Aniston co-stars as Rose a stripper (with a heart of gold of course) who gets roped into helping Jason Sudeikis small-time drug dealer transport an enormous supply of pot into the United States from Mexico. She is reluctant to do this at first. She cant stand Sudeikis cocky quick-talking David her grungy neighbor in the apartment building where shes on the verge of being evicted. Naturally this means theyll fall for each other. (Youve seen a movie before right?) David lands in deep trouble with the drug kingpin he works for (Ed Helms looking slick and skinny as he plays against type) when a bunch of street thugs steal his weed and cash. To make it right he must travel across the border and bring back a ""smidge"" of marijuana. He comes up with a plan to pretend hes part of a wholesome American family on vacation complete with a flashy tricked-out RV -- which comes in handy when he finds out how much pot hes really picking up. But first he needs a fake family so he recruits Rose to play his loving wife along with runaway street urchin Casey (Emma Roberts) and eager-beaver virgin Kenny (Will Poulter) to pose as his clean-cut teenage children. Will this fake family end up functioning as a real family in time? Of course they will. Its pure formula -- you can tell where ""Were the Millers"" is going from the billboards alone. But to its credit the comedy from director Rawson Marshall Thurber (""Dodgeball A True Underdog Story"") from a script by small army of writers stays mean and maintains a bit of an edge even when it threatens to go all soft and gooey. Scattered scenes produce laugh-out-loud moments up to and including the ad-libbed outtakes during the closing credits (which frustratingly suggest an even better movie was possible if the actors had been given even more room to roam). A scene in which Casey and Rose take turns teaching the innocent Kenny how to kiss is a prime example of the films subversive instincts. Actual tension builds even though the punch line is pretty predictable. Sudeikis and Aniston also have some amusingly awkward exchanges with a legitimately wholesome American family on a road trip with their daughter played with prim goofiness by Nick Offerman and Kathryn Hahn. And Mark L. Young proves himself to be a scene-stealer as a gangsta rapper/Kid Rock wannabe named Scottie P. who brazenly hits on Casey and makes the ersatz Miller parents feel very old and stodgy in their disapproval. Yes the ethnic stereotypes are cliched and borderline offensive. Yes the myriad pop culture references are hit and miss as they are always wont to be. But there are enough laughs throughout to make ""Were the Millers"" worthwhile as we enter the dog days of summer. As for Anistons abilities as a stripper -- er exotic dancer She looks spectacular but she is incredibly stiff. But thats part of the joke and shes clearly in on it with no apologies.

The movie was alright but could have been funnier. The kid that played Kenny stole the show. I like Jason As a leaf comedic actor. Nick offerman and his wife were the best parts. B-.

PICTURES By MICHAEL SRAGOW / ORANGE COUNTY REGISTE Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF Were the MillersStarring Jennifer Aniston Jason Sudeikis Will Poulter Emma Roberts Directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber Rating R for crude sexual content pervasive language drug material and brief graphic nudity Running time 1 hour 50 minutes Playing Throughout Orange CountyThe quick hitA high concept low farce about a quartet of young and old losers posing as a family to smuggle two tons of weed out of Mexico; all the humor is below the belt in more ways than one. Grade D The baseline for American movie humor sinks once again in this sentimentally cynical and cynically sentimental farce. It carries a message like an old-style PSA ""The family that smuggles dope together finds hope together."" Of course the Millers are not a real family. Theyre a wisecracking bachelor drug dealer (Jason Sudeikis)  an honorable stripper on the rebound (Jennifer Aniston) a plucky runaway teenage girl (Emma Roberts) and a bighearted abandoned teenage boy (Will Poulter). They impersonate a family to smuggle two tons of Mexican weed past border guards in a humongous RV. By the time they share crises such as the boys genitals getting bit by a tarantula and showdowns with a Mexican drug lord (Tomer Sisley) and his one-eyed enforcer (Matthew Willig) they become a dynasty of nincompoops. A white picket fence awaits them albeit with marijuana in the flowerbeds. The director Rawson Marshall Thurber along with a quartet of screenwriters adorns that arc with a subplot about an actual RV-riding family the Fitzgeralds (Nick Offerman and Kathryn Hahn as the parents Molly Quinn as the teenage daughter). The straight-arrow mom and pop are would-be swingers. What traumatizes the girl is the sight of the Miller females teaching her first crush - their ""brother"" and ""son"" - how to kiss. Except for the thrice-repeated sight gag of an enormous swollen testicle the humor comes off as a blend of Tourettes and TMI particularly when the two families come together. The Millers are always blurting out obscenities they must know will upset the Fitzgeralds - but hey its good for a crowd-pleasing laugh just like Mama Fitzgerald sharing data about her privates. Where are the Mexican-American lobbyists who got rid of the Fritos Bandito a few decades ago? The Mexican crooks here are routinely and uniformly loathsome. To be fair equally scummy are the double-dealing drug kingpin (Ed Helms) who forces our antihero to turn from dealer into drug mule and the strip-club owner (Ken Marino) who orders his dancers to prostitute themselves with customers. He says the move will make his club competitive with the new business across the street -- an Apple Store. Thats the most strained of the movies pop culture shout-outs. Sudeikis dialogue is peppered with late-night comedy riffs. His drug-dealer is a man who has barely updated his college activities. Now while he packs weed and makes sales he watches YouTube videos. The best and worst part of ""Were the Millers"" is that no matter how scrubby the material the cast is always ""on"" as if they know their high-concept low comedy will be a hit. Sudeikis almost manages to transform self-satisfaction into a style while Aniston brings an air of haughty determination to her big scene - a butt-slapping strip. Her proud glare says ""look dont touch."" Its a sign of how white-milk weird this movie is that she gets the most action from Mrs. Fitzgerald.

Mind you ""Were the Millers"" in which Aniston and Jason Sudeikis play feuding lowlifes who have to play husband and wife in order to smuggle two metric tons of weed across the Mexican border is full of jokes that dont connect. Watching Aniston do a striptease routine that begins with her dressed in suburban-mom garb - khaki Capri pants and a sleeveless flower-patterned blouse - ought to be funny or sexy or both but is mostly just uncomfortable. And maybe youre a kinder and more mature person than I am and wont laugh at director Rawson Marshall Thurbers shameless attempt to out-gross the ""Hangover"" franchise by showing us what a tarantula bite on the testicles looks like.""Were the Millers"" is a raunchy hard-R comedy with almost no plot worth recounting. (Shocker Amateurish drug-smuggling scheme goes awry) It doesnt try to deliver any sort of positive social message and suggests that people with real marriages and families are faking it too pretty much the way dead-end dope dealer David (Sudeikis) and broke jilted stripper Rose (Aniston) do. Maybe thats why I liked it. To the extent that the ersatz Miller familys journey through a bunch of sketch-comedy gags and ludicrous mishaps expresses any kind of worldview - there are four credited writers on this movie and God knows how many others behind the machinery - it boils down to the idea that men and women alike yearn for what they dont have and that making your way through life is about seizing the bizarre opportunities it thrusts at you.Aniston is now 44 years old and has made a string of undistinguished and often interchangeable failed comedies. I have a high tolerance for her films and I know for sure I saw both ""Just Go With It"" and ""The Switch."" Damned if I can remember a single thing about either of them. (OK one of them is an Adam Sandler movie which explains why Ive blocked it from memory.) But that age is no longer the dead zone it used to be for American actresses - Hollywood is outgrowing its sexism little by little - and Aniston still has that peculiar Everywoman charisma that made her a star in the first place. In ""Were the Millers"" she follows the course she semi-successfully pioneered in ""Horrible Bosses"" playing a damaged snappish cynical and foulmouthed version of Americas sweetheart but one who underneath it all - big surprise - is looking for love. You cant call Rose a hooker with a heart of gold even though David compares her to the Julia Roberts character in ""Pretty Woman"" because she doesnt turn tricks and denies having a heart of gold. You Might Also Like As for Sudeikis I often find him bland and overly smarmy on TV - the fact that his ""Saturday Night Live"" repertoire includes Joe Biden and Mitt Romney speaks for itself - but he and Aniston have interesting off-kilter chemistry and playing a down-and-out self-loathing drug dealer lends him just a little edge. After getting rolled by street kids David owes a big pile of money to a highly implausible drug lord played by Ed Helms and agrees to the latters patently ridiculous plan to transport an enormous load of pot inside a rented RV. (The deeply strange Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz road-trip classic ""The Long Long Trailer"" is somewhere in this movies DNA.) He talks Rose into coming along only because shes being evicted and is desperate for money. Their ""daughter"" is Casey (the terrific Emma Roberts) a street runaway with disastrous taste in boys and their ""son"" is Davids nebbishy semi-abandoned neighbor Kenny (the odd intense young English actor Will Poulter something of a revelation here). Hes the one who winds up with a tarantula in his briefs. Dont say you were not warned. Almost nothing that happens in the story is worth describing in detail except for the extended shaggy-dog interlude with a square-bear RV-drivin family (headed by the hilarious Nick Offerman and Kathryn Hahn) that keeps threatening to devolve into perverse group sex. And we understand from the first time Rose and David cross paths that this is yet another Aniston rom-com no matter how cleverly disguised and that two people who seem to hate each other so thoroughly have a quite different destination ahead. What makes ""Were the Millers"" not just watchable but funny and ultimately rewarding is the ferocity with which this central foursome go after each other the way they reject and ridicule the notion of family but hunger for it desperately at the same time. I can relate Dampen your expectations blunt your intellect - see what I did there? - and dont read anybody elses review. ""Were the Millers"" has just the right stupid humane vulgarity for the dog days of August. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

In her striptease scene she moves around as stiff as a Christian college graduate at a pole-dance class. That was my main caveat with ""Were the Millers"" a decently amusing R-rated comedy about a small-time weed dealer named David (Jason Sudeikis) who gets robbed of his cash and stash and must make a trip over the border to Mexico and smuggle a ton of pot back for his boss. (Ed Helms as smarmy as ever plays the super-rich Brad who bought an orca for his office just because he could.) In order to appear wholesome and harmless to Border Patrol David rounds up a pretend family aforementioned stripper Rose dorky virgin Kenny (Will Poulter) and hostile teen runaway Casey (Emma Roberts). After a quick makeover they look just like any khaki-clad Midwestern troupe bumbling through the Mall of America. Naturally the road trip doesnt go smoothly; how could it with such a ship of fools carrying a huge freight of marijuana in an RV? All sorts of high jinks ensue from a tarantula bite to a bust-up with two Mexican drug lords. Said shenanigans and traumas bind the ragtag group like a real family despite the sly jokes about the existential crisis of the ""American Dad."" (At a Great Clips-style salon pre-makeover David requests a haircut that will make him look ""like I wake up at 530 to commute an hour to a [crap] job to keep my kids clothed in Dora the Explorer."") On their way back to Denver the Millers meet the Fitzgeralds a wacky couple played by Nick Offerman (whom I cannot separate from Ron Swanson try as I might) and Kathryn Hahn. Hahn is relatively brilliant as the stereotypical square small-town mother whose idea of ""swinging"" is getting a handful of Anistons clothed breasts. They stick around just long enough to begin wearing on your nerves much like the friendly neighbors at your local RV park. WERE THE MILLERS 1/2 out of 4 stars Rated R for crude sexual content pervasive language drug material and brief graphic nudity. Though incredibly predictable from start to finish ""Were the Millers"" did make me laugh. The humor is fast-paced more often than it is shticky rude and ribald with more than a few incest jokes. Sudeikis is charming with his toothpaste-commercial smile. His ""children"" Roberts and Poulter are fun to watch. Aniston seems far more comfortable in her ""Mom"" disguise of Capri pants than she does in stripper-wear thus proving my point. Is Jennifer Aniston funny or does she just have great hair? I guess thats the eternal question. Kara Nesvig is a Minneapolis writer.

Were the Millers review Awkward laughs 1 / 7 Back to Gallery Were the Millers Comedy. Starring Jennifer Aniston and Jason Sudeikis. Directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber. (R. 110 minutes.) Comedies are getting more and more vulgar which is not necessarily a bad thing. Fifteen years ago just about every comedy was rated PG-13 and anything to do with families ended on some fake sentimental uplift straight out of an old TV sitcom. New comedies are a relief from that but when theyre vulgar for the sake of vulgar thats just another form of dishonesty ""Were the Millers"" is right down the middle sometimes crude to be crude sometimes finding humor in the crude world we live in. Sometimes its labored sometimes its funny. Sometimes it feels like four people worked on the screenplay and not one of them loved it and sometimes it sneaks up and finds a laugh or two. Get past the comedy and theres something almost weird at the movies core - a deep cynicism about family and a longing for family both at the same time. But the screenplay is too much of a patchwork to express anything deep or unconscious. Still the setup has something Jason Sudeikis is David a small-time drug dealer who is forced to go to Mexico to pick up several tons of marijuana and drive it across the border. Because a lone scruffy guy crossing the border is more likely to get stopped than a wholesome American family he recruits a stripper (Jennifer Aniston) to pose as his wife and hires a runaway (Emma Roberts) and a neighbor (Will Poulter) to impersonate their kids for the drug run. That adventure and its aftermath make up ""Were the Millers"" and along the way we find the usual personality clashes and gunplay - yes gunplay; its a comedy about drug smuggling after all. A big weakness of the movie is that its characters are constantly doing things against their own interests. Comedies dont need to be believable but they do need to be logical. Just one example of many At one point with enough drugs in their RV to send them up the river for decades Rose (Aniston) and David decide to rob a DEA officer. Why would they do something so incredibly insane? Because as it turns out theres a comic bit at the end of that chain that someone wanted to cram in. Its that kind of thing again and again Awkwardness character distortion and strain followed by almost enough laughs to be worth it. Playing a stripper is outside Anistons usual zone allowing her to be a little more coarse than usual. Thats fine and she makes the most of it though the stripping scenes arent flattering. Its not that she doesnt look good - actually she looks great - but theres an age at which silly and flamboyant display makes emotional and aesthetic sense and whatever that age is its really really young. However on her resume Aniston can now check off pole dancing. As befitting a movie written by a committee ""Were the Millers"" is too long with everyones bits included. But the cast carries it a long way. Sudeikis is appealing if a little too nasty at times though thats partly the role. The young actors Roberts and Poulter are comically skilled. And Kathryn Hahn and Nick Offerman are fairly funny to the extent they get a chance to be. All these mild virtues dont quite add up to a recommendation but if you said you wanted to see ""Were the Millers"" I wouldnt block the door.

"Were the Millers | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; we-re-the-millers ) Were the Millers (United States 2013) August 07 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli Of all the cast members of the former Friends Jennifer Aniston is by far the most successful. But theres no correlation between ""success"" and ""quality."" For a while Aniston showed a willingness to try different things and experiment (her high point being The Good Girl) but in the past decade she has fallen into a depressing rut. Theres a sameness to her films and her characters rarely show any range or depth. A ""Jennifer Aniston movie"" has become synonymous with ""derivative lackluster mediocrity"" and its a shame. We know she has both talent and charisma but nothing on her recent resume has allowed her to display those qualities. So were stuck with films that are at best forgettable and at worst painful. Were the Millers falls in between those two extremes closer to the latter than the former. Were the Millers is a comedy and to say something nice about it it contains its share of worthwhile moments and tiny pleasures. Some of the jokes are funny. If one was to compile all the good snippets and scenes into a highlight reel it might run about six minutes. Unfortunately the movie as a whole has a running time of 110 minutes. That means that accounting for credits theres close to 100 minutes of tedium to endure which results in a mathematical ratio of 161 in favor of the drab the monotonous and the just plain boring. I think of a number of better ways to spend 10. Sorry but the sight of Jennifer Aniston in translucent underwear imitating Jennifer Beals from Flashdance (to the wrong music) just aint worth it. The film doesnt have a good handle on what it wants to be. Theres some sense that it covets the naughty tone of those raunchy expletive-laden comedies like The Hangover but it never commits fully. Aside from Aniston and co-stars Emma Roberts and Jason Sudeikis dropping the f-bomb every few minutes theres nothing extraordinary about the profanity. The only nudity is a shot of prosthetic male genitalia. Its supposed to be funny and maybe 11-year old boys will think it is. But the humor lacks an edge and seems strangely unwilling to offend. Take for example the scene in which a gay policeman wants a sexual favor as a bribe. The film plays with this for a while but eventually finds a way out. The problem may be that Were the Millers is trying to be a ""comedy with a heart"" but the sentimental aspect is inelegantly grafted on and comes across as artificial and scripted. Its possible to have a feel-good raunchy comedy but the formula if there is one eludes director Rawson Marshall Thurber and his team of writers. The premise is thin. David (Sudeikis) is a small-time drug dealer who ends up in a bad situation when thugs steal his stash and cash. Now hes in debt to the tune of about 40000 to his supplier (Ed Helms) without an obvious way to pay up. The solution is for David to do a drug-run enter Mexico pick up a ""smidge"" of high-grade weed and bring it back across the border. For his trouble his debt will be paid off and hell get 100000. David reluctantly agrees. Since vacationing families are routinely ignored at border crossings he decides to ""adopt"" a temporary wife and kids for the trip. Joining him are a stripper Rose (Aniston); a homeless girl Casey (Emma Roberts); and a boy with an absentee mother Kenny (Will Poulter). Posing as The Millers they head south get the drugs then cross back into the U.S. Thats when their difficulties begin. Its obvious the movie is in some trouble when the smuggling has been completed 45 minutes into the proceedings. The rest of Were the Millers is occupied by desperate attempts to postpone the ending. We get angry drug lords overly friendly campers interested in exploring their boundaries (this is another scene that could have been hilarious had the filmmakers been willing to push limits rather than pull back) and the obligatory bonding between ""family members."" By the time the end credits rolled I was eager to get out of the theater even if it meant missing the obligatory outtakes. A case could be made that Were the Millers might be suitable for home viewing where expectations are low and the atmosphere is more relaxed. Even then however a little fast-forwarding might be necessary to get through some of dead spots. Aniston fans are once again treated to a tease - this is yet another movie stripper who keeps her underwear on. Sudeikis fans may have the dA(c)jA  vu feeling of watching a bad SNL sketch that never wants to end. Nick Offerman and Kathryn Hahn inject a little energy but it doesnt last. Were the Millers is as generic as R-rated comedies get a perfect vehicle to enhance Jennifer Anistons motion picture reputation. Its not good enough to recommend nor bad enough to attract sadistic curiosity seekers in search of a train wreck. The budget was reportedly a skinny 30 million and while thats not much by Hollywood standards it still could have been better spent in any number of other ways like paying the catering bill for the next James Cameron blockbuster.

Comments click to enlarge Were the Millers Video Rated R  110 minutes  2013 A small-time drug dealer (Jason Sudeikis) poses as a suburban dad to smuggle an RV full of marijuana across the U.S.-Mexican border recruiting a washed-up stripper (Jennifer Aniston) and two pathetic teenagers to pose as his family. This is surprisingly mean-spirited for a mainstream comedy; the filmmakers seem to regard every moronic supporting character with contempt and many of the gags are predicated on sexual degradation. Those qualities could yield a bracing satire but the filmmakers lack the courage of their convictions falling back on moments of egregiously false sentimentality whenever the material threatens to turn dark.

Can somebody please explain Jason Sudeikiss appeal? He always seemed like one of the weaker links in an already-weak Saturday Night Live lineup - the bland sorta-handsome guy used mostly as a straight man who displayed little comic ingenuity when left to his own devices. The most promising aspect of his comic persona is his insincerity; hes good at giving off the sense that he never really means what he says. But compared to a guy like Will Arnett or Chevy Chase in his prime Sudeikiss disingenuousness is a very impoverished one his surface blandness masking merely more inner blandness. Its that insincerity that probably led to Sudeikis getting cast as David Clark a Denver slacker and pot dealer who after getting 43000 worth of drugs and money stolen from him is forced to smuggle some pot across the border from Mexico. His ingenious scheme is to hire several fellow down-and-outers to pretend to be his family as he correctly assumes that an annoying all-American tourist family crossing the border will arouse less suspicion than one solitary dude doing so. So he convinces Rose (Jennifer Aniston) a stripper who lives in his building Kenny (Will Poulter) a painfully-straitlaced geek who idolizes him and Casey (Emma Roberts) a street kid to pose as his family. They hop in a gigantic RV and go off to retrieve what turns out to be a massive amount of weed from some Mexican drug lords whose relationship to Davids own kingpin boss proves a tad more complicated. Its a predictable setup but it has potential. And it does yield some occasionally solid laughs mainly thanks to the supporting cast. As Davids impossibly corporate scuzz of a boss Ed Helms gets the films best scenes and has the most energy Hes enthusiastic and bewildered by all the money and power he has. As the two oddball kids pretending to be the Millers offspring a refreshingly profane Roberts and the cringingly dorky Poulter also have their moments; shes appropriately loose and jaded hes eager-to-please and adorably tense. As the stripper/mom Anistons report card is a little more mixed She does fine pretending to bring her ""family"" into a prayer circle or giving out casserole tips but whenever she has to get wild or unpredictable she falters. Theres a pretty funny charades scene where Kenny attempts to draw a skateboard and all Rose sees is variations on a penis. But its not funny because shes a stripper who cant hide her stripper-ness; its funny because she still seems kind of square as she yells out ""Big black dick ... black cock ... black hawk ... Black Hawk Down"" Watching her you keep thinking that the movie would make more sense the other way If she were playing an actual suburban mom forced to do terrible things like run drugs or strip to save her life. Part of the problem here is that at heart Aniston and Sudeikis are both foils looking for their wilder more volatile counterparts. What the movie needs is someone who can effectively convey a hint of the degenerate -- Melissa McCarthy say or Jim Carrey in his prime. And in Sudeikiss case quite aside from not being particularly funny he also doesnt convince on any level Not as a guy who never grew out of his college career dealing weed not as a selfish cheat who lies to his fake family to get them to go along with his scheme and certainly not as the changed man who realizes that maybe he does want a real family after all. The result is a loose conglomeration of jokes that never really holds together Funny in parts but overwhelmed by the bland emptiness where its protagonist should be.

View Caption About video ads View Caption of The 25 best movie comedies of all time Monitor Movie Guide ""Were the Millers"" tries to be a more dirty-minded version of those old ""National Lampoon"" family road trip movies. Jason Sudeikis plays a small-time dope dealer Jennifer Aniston is his stripper neighbor Will Poulter is a virginal teen living in his apartment building and Emma Roberts plays a homeless punkette. In order to smuggle 1500 kilos of marijuana across the Mexican border Sudeikiss character rents an RV and bribes this warring trio into pretending to be one big peachy-keen family.Sudeikis reportedly did a lot of joke enhancement on the script (credited to multiple writers) but not nearly enough. Even tastelessness needs to have some taste. The blue humor in ""Were the Millers"" is just bland. And yes Aniston performs a (modified) striptease. Thats pretty bland too.

(Michael Tackett/AP) By Ann Hornaday August 6 2013 Follow AnnHornaday ""Were the Millers"" a raunchy druggy profanity-laced comedy starring Jason Sudeikis and Jennifer Aniston is a dog-days movie the kind of left-handed programmer that slips easily onto screens in August makes a few bills and exits without much notice. Theres nothing special about it -- this is a movie made to exploit the hard-R successes of ""The Hangover"" and ""Bridesmaids"" -- but it would be dishonest to claim it isnt funny. The laughs may come in fits and starts usually by way of sight gags and set pieces but they do come. And then they go. Sudeikis plays David a middle-aged pot dealer whose career as easygoing weed man takes a turn when his boss (Ed Helms) forces him to travel to Mexico and bring back ""a smidge"" of ""marriage-ya-wanna."" At first stymied by the prospect of evading border security David lights on the idea of making the run in an RV while impersonating the clean-cut dad of an all-American family. He enlists a stripper named Rose (Aniston) a local runaway named Casey (Emma Roberts) and his young neighbor Kenny (Will Poulter) to scrub up paste on Pepsodent smiles and for 72 hours pretend they can all stand each other. Written by Hollywood technicians too numerous to mention ""Were the Millers"" hasnt been crafted as much as expertly machined for maximum exploitation whether its Aniston showcasing her killer bod in not one but two steamy strip scenes or Sudeikiss bland affability -- which in this case is juxtaposed with a nearly unbroken stream of f-bombs and coarse crass one-liners. The humor derives from the misdirect of such wholesome characters doing and saying such vile things and several times it works One of the funniest sequences features Kenny -- who really is as innocent as hes pretending to be -- being taught how to kiss by his ""sister"" and his ""mother."" Later David and Rose fall into an amusingly staged ""swinging"" encounter with fellow RVers played by Nick Offerman and Kathryn Hahn. The movies signature sight gag involves an errant tarantula and its unfortunate aftermath -- a joke that seems to have been pulled off a shelf groaning with similar outre bits lined up and classified like so many widgets (gigantically swollen body part check). ""Were the Millers"" features some memorable performances including Offerman Mark L. Young as Caseys hilariously dim hip-hopped-up suitor and Poulter who proves to be a sweetly game straight man (in every sense of that word) and knows his way around a TLC song. ""Were the Millers"" may not send the audience into any soaring highs but it does produce a mild buzz. Were the Millers 1/2 (109 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for crude sexual content pervasive profanity drug material and brief graphic nudity. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

RELATED NEWS Interview Will Poulter Interview Aniston and Sudeikis By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Tue Aug 6 2013 207 PM ""It plays like a Saturday Night Live skit that goes on too long."" Weve heard that phrase used so often to describe former ""SNL"" members disappointing movies that its become a cliche. But you know what? ""Were the Millers"" plays like a ""Saturday Night Live"" skit that goes on too long. Cant be helped. And Jason Sudeikis is the former cast member holding the bag this time around. This isnt to say that there arent some laughs in the movie. There are and a few are huge. But theyre just sort of strung together one set up after another with a story not strong enough to support them. Sudeikis plays David a small-time marijuana dealer happy selling to housewives and friends until hes beaten and robbed by some thugs. David has to make a payment to his supplier Brad (Ed Helms) an unctuous jerk. But Brad has a proposal If David will go to Mexico and bring just a tiny little bit of pot across the border Brad will forgive his debts and pay him for his troubles. David isnt thrilled at the prospect as international drug smuggling wasnt really on his list of life goals. But he doesnt have much choice. Then he hits upon an idea A family wouldnt be nearly as likely to arouse suspicion. The only problem is that he doesnt have one. So he recruits one. For his son he gets Kenny (Will Poulter) a goofy awkward kid who lives in Davids building. For a daughter he goes with Casey (Emma Roberts) a smart-aleck runaway whose troubles led to David getting robbed in the first place. Finally for his wife David recruits Rose (Jennifer Aniston) a stripper who also lives in his building and has no use for him. But the lure of a payoff proves too great. So theyre off in a tricked-out RV. And theres your ""SNL"" skit. ""Fake Family"" or something like that. Things dont go as planned of course. If they did there wouldnt be much of a movie. There are twists and double-crosses and a pretty great night out with super-straight-laced Don and Edie Fitzgerald (Nick Offerman and Kathyrn Hahn always funny) and their daughter Melissa (Molly C. Quinn). Much of the humor derives from dysfunction and shock value. Its funny to hear a kid curse. Sorry it just is. (Ahem. As long as its not your kid.) But only for a while. The same goes with the dysfunction. A group of floridly mismatched people is kind of funny but director Rawson Marshall Thurber eventually heads toward safer ground and thats not as funny. Oh and this If you have Jennifer Aniston playing a stripper then you evidently must have her you know strip down to bra and panties. In a hot garage. In Mexico. Under a shower of water. And steam. People would probably ask for their money back otherwise. (Note Whatever exercise program shes doing its working.) Its easy to see this movie hitting big on cable and DVD. Its built for taking out specific lines and bits and reciting them over and over because then you dont notice if they dont all fit together neatly. So yes its funny but not particularly clever. The smartest joke in the movie is actually one shown in the outtakes at the end at Anistons expense. Thus if you dumb down your expectations youll be OK. The thing is you shouldnt have to.

Entertainment)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY 1/2 out of fourStars Jason Sudeikis Jennifer Aniston Nic Offerman Emma Roberts Ed Helms Will PoulterRated R; runtime 1 hour 50 minutes; opens Wednesday nationwideWere the Millers is a twisted road trip worth avoiding. Not only is it not funny its offensive.Case in point a scene in which a father is willing to pimp out his teenage son to perform sexual favors on a corrupt policeman in order to avoid arrest. He urges the boy to do it for the good of the family.Granted the ""father"" is a drug dealer and his ""son"" is not related to him but a clueless neighbor kid posing as his child. Still its an adult jovially pushing an unusually innocent boy to prostitute himself. Even in raucous R-rated comedies theres a line that is best not crossed. In its zeal to be outrageous Were the Millers ( 1/2 out of four; rated R; opens Wednesday nationwide) is tone-deaf mistaking the cringe-worthy for edgy humor.REVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersFormer Saturday Night Live regular Jason Sudeikis plays David a small-time pot dealer with mostly suburban customers. One evening as hes jumping to the defense of his neighbor Kenny (Will Poulter) hes attacked and robbed by some not terribly imposing-looking punks who take thousands of dollars worth of weed and all his cash. Davids supplier Brad (Ed Helms) orders him to pay back the value of what was stolen and offers a way to erase his debt Drive to Mexico and smuggle a shipment of marijuana over the border.David decides he should take along a ""family"" to appear less conspicuous to the border authorities. So he recruits Kenny and a street-smart girl named Casey (Emma Roberts) to pose as his teen kids. It takes some work but he persuades his neighbor Rose (Jennifer Aniston) a cynical stripper to pose as his wife. Hijinks ensue.STORY Jennifer Aniston gets dirty with Jason SudeikisPHOTOS Aniston and Sudeikis together againPREMIERE Jennifer Aniston gets naughty in The MillersThe ""family"" is equipped with a huge RV to lumber down to Mexico. They go to the appointed drug compound and load up with marijuana.This expedition occurs over the Fourth of July weekend. En route the two teens act briefly like siblings whining to stop for fireworks. And of course Rose and David begin to sound like parents. When its not trying for laughs Millers aims to be heartwarming. The audience is meant to conclude that this foursome has come to care about each other like a family but the manipulation is even less successful than the fruitless stabs at humor.Sudeikis and Aniston have no chemistry though they supposedly fall for each other. An encounter with another family in an RV offers the movies only laughs courtesy of Nick Offerman and Kathryn Hahn.Aniston performs a couple of clumsily filmed scenes with stripper moves leaving viewers to wonder if the movie exists solely for her to show that at 44 shes still in fantastic shape.Given that laughs are so few and far between there must be an ulterior motive to this dreadful excuse for a comedy. 353 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 80 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1cF6DhzSummer Movies Calendar AugustTake a look at the films heading to the box office this August complete with trailers reviews clips related stories and more.

The hit black comedy Horrible Bosses which had three angry underlings plotting murderous vengeance against their you-know-whats should have been a master class in that distinction. The film roiled with barely restrained rage but director Seth Gordon seemed not to care whether his characters desperate turn to killing made them despicable human beings--Gordon was content to let his viewers know hes had those feelings too.Horrible Bosses co-stars Jason Sudeikis and Jennifer Aniston team up again as reluctant drug mules in Were the Millers. But this films eagerness to please functions as a slow poison draining The Millers of its vitality by rendering its characterization uneven its potential undeveloped and its plot predictable and stupid. Sudeikis cant find a center amid the scripts erratic tonal whims while Aniston so thrillingly sexy as a man-eating dentist in Bosses disappointingly reverts back to Americas Sweetheart Stripper Edition.Sudeikis plays David a small-time Denver dope peddler whos not going to let marriage or parenthood harsh his life--nor will he let anyone forget it. (This is how you know hell end up a hubby and daddy later in the film.) Davids the Mr. Rogers of drug dealers--hes neighborhood-friendly enough not to sell to a kid (Will Poulter)--but also the kind of amoral schmuck wholl exploit that kids sense of chivalry to convince him to fellate a bribe-seeking Mexican cop (Luis Guzman). (Dont worry the kids of age and the films too tame to let the boy go through with it.)Film Details Were the Millers RatingR GenreComedy Running Time110 More Info When some street punks steal Davids stash and cash hes kidnapped and forced by his own horrible boss (Ed Helms in his sunny douchebag persona) to drive across the border and bring back ""a smidge and a half"" of product from Mexico. Hoping to avoid suspicion he recruits his lap-dancing neighbor Rose (Aniston) abandoned teenager Kenny--the gentlemanly dude from the near-miss blowie--and underage runaway Casey (Emma Roberts) to pose as the Millers his hunky-dory family. Despite being broke David rents an RV sumptuous enough to be the first floor of Will Smiths trailer and its off to the cartel compound they go.You can fill in the rest. As the road trip progresses sitcom-style family dynamics set in. The Millers are forced into repeated contact with another RV family (Nick Offerman Kathryn Hahn and Molly C. Quinn) exactly the kind of Velveeta-flavored squares David and Rose loathe to their bones. (Hahn makes the best of her underwritten frumpy mom; she pronounces ""tampon"" to rhyme with ""dampen"" and curses ""Oh Klahoma"") A mix-up back in Mexico makes the Millers the target of a drug lord (Tomer Sisley) though he and his melty-eyed henchman (Matthew Willig) pursue them so leisurely they might well be taking siestas every few hours.The film earns its R rating with quick shots of misshapen male genitalia and an extended kissing gag where Kenny makes out with both his fake sister and his fake mother building to a true uproar. Yet it doesnt compare with the small character-driven moment when the dorkalicious Kenny thanks an old Mexican woman with the only Spanish he knows ""Namaste."" Unfortunately such pleasures occur rarely as the film resorts too often to the kind of lazy humor in which a string of curse words plugs in the blanks where the jokes are supposed to go.Its become a cliche for critics to call a films actors themes or topicality ""wasted"" but its especially true for Were the Millerss one area of natural sympathy the characters downward mobility. Three of the four Millers hinge their social and moral identities on somewhat idiosyncratic distinctions a dealer not a smuggler; a stripper not a prostitute; a runaway but not homeless. They only become frantic enough to try something incredibly stupid--like risking a 25-year prison sentence for 10000 or even just a grand--when circumstances compel them into crossing the fine lines that separate them from the qualities they define themselves against. The characters are on the margins but the movie itself is too cowardly to explore what those margins mean how nice people end up in them and how life there can lead to crime.Separately and together Davids Roses and Caseys economic insecurity also manifests as a kind of lame hipness an unthinking condescension toward the people in the income bracket just above them. Those Miller members roll their eyes at the well-heeled white-bread nuclear families around them in their yellowing RVs--the people who are physically close enough to sneer at but too socioeconomically out-of-reach to ever join. In the face of chronic loneliness and financial precariousness the Millers cling to their carefully cultivated coolness because antisocial snobbery is all theyve got left. Instead of self-awareness and growth though the script gives the characters what it thinks they really need a big house to hide from all their friendly neighbors. A family that hates together stays together.Subscribe to the Voice Film Club podcastFollow VoiceFilmClub Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Inkoo Kang Follow thinkovision Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

"Were the Millers tears strip off family values review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesWere the Millers tears strip off family values reviewWere the Millers stars Jennifer Aniston Jason Sudeikis in gross-out comedy about drug smugglers passing as all-American family.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterWed. Aug. 7 2013Were the MillersStarring Jennifer Aniston Jason Sudeikis Emma Roberts Will Poulter Nick Offerman Kathryn Hahn and Ed Helms. Directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber. 110 minutes. Opening Aug. 7 at major theatres. 14AWere the Millers asks you to believe that somewhere in this world theres a pot dealer who prides himself on not selling to kids and a stripper who never takes her bra off.Its all in the service of gross-out comedy (how many times must I write this descriptor this year?) that sends David (Horrible Bosses Jason Sudeikis recently departed from SNL) on a fools errand to try to repay his gleefully nasty drug lord Brad (The Hangovers Ed Helms) whom he owes after a spot of bother with some thieving thugs made off with his stash and his cash.Article Continued BelowBrad tells Dave a quick jaunt to Mexico to ferry ""a smidge or mary-juana"" across the border will erase his debt plus result in a cash incentive. Its an offer Dave cant refuse but how to organize the haul without a trip to the slammer?Dave hits on the bright idea that no border guard would look twice at an all-American family heading south for some authentic chimichangas on the Fourth of July then coming back to the land of the free and the brave.But where does a lone dealer find a family?Enter his sarcastic stripping neighbour Rose (Jennifer Aniston aka the peeler that doesnt) snide street kid Casey (Emma Roberts) and loveable innocent teen from his building Kenny (the magnificently eyebrow-endowed Will Poulter). David offers to share the wealth with the crew reminding a reluctant Rose this isnt drug dealing its a higher calling smugglingSoon theyre scrubbed buffed and puffed and re-branded as the Millers.Directed by Dodgeballs Rawson Marshall Thurber the screenplay by Bob Fisher and Steve Faber (Wedding Crashers) and Sean Anders and John Morris (Hot Tub Time Machine) initially offers some comic promise as we watch these trash-talking low-lifes struggle to get all American.But the wheels fall off the Winnebago rather quickly as the story takes the same bumpy road as the newly minted Millers massive RV getting off at easy gags instead of taking a more scenic story route. Do we need to see the results of a spider bite to Kennys testicle? Why yes we do. In fact lets show them the whole kit and caboodle as long as were down there. The red-band trailer pretty much does the entire movie in under three minutes if time is tight this week. Or rent 2012s Wanderlust with Aniston and Paul Rudd. Its pretty much all there.Still Sudeikis is certainly the most likable drug dealer youre ever going to meet. He and Aniston who is not without comic talents and is rocking an admirable hot body shes obviously worked hard to acquire despite her no-nudity clause have solid chemistry onscreen especially with a running gag revolving around a decoy baby.The problem with Were The Millers is the fun times never last.A trailer park meet-up with fellow RVers the Fitzgeralds (Nick Offerman and Kathryn Hahn) a pair of uptight campers curious about taking a walk on the wild side is fun if not predictable. But a no-its-not incest make-out scene is so creepy it may make you want to stick your head in the popcorn bucket.

Were The Millers attempts to demonstrate that principle at feature length using as a case study the tale of a debt-ridden Denver pot dealer (Jason Sudeikis) whos tasked with smuggling a massive stash from Mexico for a college friend (Ed Helms) who is now a killer-whale-owning importer/kingpin. Seeking decoys Sudeikis recruits a fake family that includes a stripper (Jennifer Aniston) a runaway (Emma Roberts) and a kid from his apartment building (Will Poulter) counting on the illusion of harmlessness to deter the border guards from the giant cache of ganja in their RV. Weed plus raunch plus road trip plus stereotypes equals surefire laughs right? Alas the sentimentality that marred Rawson Marshall Thurbers otherwise freewheeling Dodgeball A True Underdog Story is omnipresent here. Come for the tarantula-bitten testicles or Luis Guzman soliciting sexual favors as a corrupt police officer (in a truly cringe-inducing bit); stay for the ""unexpected"" bonding lessons in how to talk to a girl and a moral that might as well have been sponsored by Partnership For A Drug-Free America. Just dont leave before the end credits which feature the cast playing a prank on Aniston thats at least as funny as anything in the film. On the basis of the outtakes the four screenwriters (whove variously worked on Married...With Children Wedding Crashers and Hot Tub Time Machine) have left it to the actors to devise many of the jokes. In lieu of these punchlines the screenplay offers a surfeit of plot slowing down would-be screwball pacing with a lot of excess... stuff. Too many story strands need to pay off (is it absolutely essential that Roberts fall for a spelling-challenged motorcycle rat?). Too many contrivances become necessary to steer the movie back on course (because naturally the head of a cartel preparing to murder four people would be dumb enough to allow Aniston a few minutes to distract him with a striptease). Oh theres also a DEA agent (Nick Offerman) and his wife (the normally more reliable Kathryn Hahn) keeping pace with the main foursome facilitating lame swingers gags and preserving the threat of discovery long after any real fake family would be in the clear. Loud and annoying? Occasionally. Funny? Sometimes. Likely to be noticed by filmgoers six months from now? Not really.

In Snitch Dwayne Johnson tries bringing a cartel kingpin to justice - but when ""El Topo"" loses his top look out. And what about that lunatic hombre in The Smurfs 2? OK maybe not. More about Were the Millers >> The image of contrabanding Latin American businessmen takes another hit in Were the Millers an innocuously smutty road comedy starring Jason Sudeikis and Jennifer Aniston. Sudeikis is Dave a small-time pot dealer and all-around under-achiever. Aniston is Rose a stripper with money problems. A pot dealer a stripper - wholesome family values here we come Which is actually what the intermittently funny Were the Millers is about Dave is in a jam thanks to unctuous big-time dealer Brad Gurdlinger (Ed Helms) and the only way to fix things is to head down Sonora way and pick up a ""smidge"" of marijuana. When Dave brings the weed back to Denver his debt will be forgiven. But how to get across the border without drawing the attention of customs agents? Pretend youre Mr. and Mrs. Miller a happy husband and wife with two squeaky-clean kids in tow thats how. And so a gawky lost boy (Will Poulter) and a ""homeless gutter punk"" (an amusingly snarky Emma Roberts) are rounded up and thrown in the RV. Drive they said. The drug lord the ""Millers"" make their pickup from is Pablo Chacon (Tomer Sisley). When the huge shipment of grass gets into the wrong hands Pablo is understandably upset. He grunts and sneers jumps in his sports car and the chase is on. (He also demands Rose prove shes a stripper thereby allowing Aniston the opportunity to show off her sculpted bod.) Another couple Don and Edie Fitzgerald (Nick Offerman and Kathryn Hahn) traveling with their teenage daughter (Molly C. Quinn) roll up in their RV forcing Sudeikis and Anistons characters to amp up their charade. The families share a campsite - and the couples share a tent for an exploratory round of ""swinging."" Were the Millers is one of those R-rated comedies where it feels redundant to even bother noting that the humor hinges on scenarios more commonly associated with porn. That Sudeikis can even keep a straight face as he urges his ersatz son - a virgin by the way - to sexually accommodate a corrupt Mexican cop (Luis Guzman) is something of a feat. The gags dont stop there. Were the Millers 1/2 (Out of four stars) Directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber. With Jason Sudeikis Jennifer Aniston Emma Roberts Will Poulter and Nick Offerman. Distributed by Warner Bros. Running time 1 hour 50 mins.

To read the whole story subscribe to BostonGlobe.com Were the Millers Share Comment For a movie about a group of drug smugglers pretending to be an all-American clan ""Were the Millers"" hogs the middle of the road like the big farty RV at its center. Its an August dog-day special A few easy laughs one or two flashes of inspiration and enough sentimentality to ensure that no one actually gets hurt. Jason Sudeikis plays a Denver-based pot dealer who hires a fake family to get his weed across the border from Mexico Stripper ""wife"" (Jennifer Aniston) geeky ""son"" (Will Poulter) and teen runaway ""daughter"" (Emma Roberts). The casting alone tells you how edge-free the movie is. Poulter Nick Offerman and Kathryn Hahn are the wild cards here; otherwise ""Were the Millers"" is a limper less funny version of its own trailer. Full story for BostonGlobe.com subscribers.

As hes already into his distributor for 40 large he is now looking at a bullet in the back of the head. Until his boss comes up with a solution Work off the debt by bringing in two tons of dope from Mexico. And David comes up with a plan -- smuggle it across the border by pretending to be the least suspicious character possible the dad in a mythical suburban American family he dubs ""the Millers."" Theres only one problem -- David doesnt know any suburban Americans mythical or otherwise. David only knows aging strippers and teenage runaways. Can he really pass them off as the Brady Bunch? Well anyway on with the show. And on with ""Were the Millers"" a raunchy hit-or-miss comedy offering one of the last big studio films before we start slipping into the clear-the-shelves everything-must-go part of the summer release season. The movie comes with a bit of a comedy pedigree. Two of its four credited screenwriters also gave us ""Wedding Crashers""; director Rawson Marshall Thurber made the oddly appealing ""Dodgeball."" The idea of the masquerade is a good one and Thurber keeps up the pace. Its the casting thats a little off. Jason Sudeikis is David and hes an actor whos simply hard to warm to; he can play the horn-dog coward (and does in film after film) but hes not good at conveying sincerity or winning sympathy; while hes fine in the first half of the film when hes required to soften later it doesnt play. (Jason Bateman an earlier choice for the part would have nailed it.) Jennifer Aniston meanwhile has the opposite problem -- shes too sympathetic and too determined to stay that way to let herself get really raunchy. While shes clearly having fun talking dirty thats as far as the sweetheart of the supermarket mags is willing to go; the club she works at shows less skin than a Saturday afternoon at Wildwood. Basically he never convinces as a good guy; she never convinces as a bad girl. Aniston and Sudeikis are both pros though and they have a pleasant chemistry as the fake couple; the film also gets a jolt from a supporting cast of such comic troupers as Ed Helms Thomas Lennon Ken Marino and the marvelous Nick Offerman and Kathryn Hahn as a pair of genuine RV-ers whose paths clumsily cross with the Millers. Each one is terrific -- Offerman and Hahn pretty much steal the show -- and there are a few surprises too like Mark L. Young who plays a dim carny worker or Lee Poulter who plays the Millers fictional son and looks as if he stepped right out of a comical Norman Rockwell cover. (Less believable is daughter Emma Roberts who does little but roll her eyes after every other line.) But in the end Sudeikis is a little too smarmy and Aniston a little too clean-cut to really sell these characters and while like all R-rated comedies the movie feels obligated to include both a shot of male genitals and a gross-out gag (it actually combines the two) its never as gleefully naughty as ""This Is the End"" or even ""The Heat."" As one of Davids own disappointed clients might complain itll give you a little buzz all right. But its not really primo product. Ratings note The film contains full-frontal nudity sexual situations strong language drug use and violence. Were the Millers (R) Warner Bros. (110 min.) Directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber.

From ""Heathers"" to ""The Hangover"" seeing our deepest character flaws thrown out on the table laid bare and played for chuckles can be a massively cathartic film-viewing experience. The ""moral"" angle on this method is constantly being played out in our society. As in does playing ""Grand Theft Auto"" cause residual real-life violence? Or simply reflect it? My view is that it doesnt cause violence instead allowing us to expunge the random deviant thoughts we all have in a safe way. For a recent example consider ""Pineapple Express"" a movie that puts you into the mind of a slightly off-kilter drug dealer knowing full well youd never become one due to it. Yep escapist dark comedy when done right is nothing less than awesome. Which brings us to ""Were the Millers"". This is a film that starts as if it were ""Grosse Pointe Blank"" but soon stumbles and devolves into something more closely approximating ""The Brady Bunch"". To figure out why this misstep is so frustrating we must consider the opening premise. The central character David (Jason Sudeikis) is a drug dealer who has fallen on hard times. Hes strong-armed by his boss ostensibly a drug kingpin (played with gusto by Ed Helms) into agreeing to smuggle pot across the Mexican border. What could go wrong? Clearly everything which is why David opts to enlist the help of an exotic dancer (Jennifer Aniston) and two teens (Will Poulter and Emma Roberts). The hope is that under the guide of being a family the border crossing guards will pay the ""Miller"" clan scant attention. So far as plans and movie premises go thats certainly a sturdy enough foundation. One could make a great movie out of that set-up though sadly ""Were the Millers"" isnt it. Now to be fair ""Were the Millers"" has some nice moments. When the film is allowed to indulge its (clearly) darker side it hums along with brutal efficiency. After all this is a film about drug smuggling wherein a drug dealer cons a fake daughter (who is seemingly a homeless runaway) into helping him realize ill-gotten gains. Additionally the son its hinted at has been abandoned by his mom left to fend for himself. Plus Jennifer Anistons character Rose is a born hustler as one would have to be to survive in the adult entertainment business.This is the stuff dark comedies and/or tragedies are made of drawing laughs entirely from the premise of flawed individuals doing terrible things and behaving badly. Here is where the successful marrow of the film can be tapped when no one cares about anyone else when everyone is trying to get ahead at the expense of all the others. Think ""Seinfeld"" but with copious amounts of pot. Violence incredible amounts of bad language and extremely adult themes will have you laughing out of both surprise and discomfort. Much like ""Bad Santa"" or ""Horrible Bosses"" before it one tunes in for the darkness which is why its so disappointing when ""Were the Millers"" decides its something else altogether. It decides its a comedy with heart and this is the choice that ultimately dooms it from being anything other than average. Approximately an hour into the film its revealed that why these people who have never spent any real amount of time together (and who are engaged in breaking the law in so many ways) are actually fine and decent human beings And suddenly the movie begins to deteriorate into a nearly unwatchable glimmer of its former filthier self. Why the lessons and sermonizing? Why the tonal shift thats almost certain to have people rolling their eyes? If youre a bear in the woods be a bear in the woods foraging attacking hibernating and generally being a bear Do bear stuff dont all of a sudden attempt to be a kangaroo because thats just silly talk. Unfortunately ""Were the Millers"" doesnt come close to understanding this very simple equation which is precisely why its half of a good movie and another half that no one asked for or wanted. SCORE 5.0 / 10 Laremy wrote the book on film criticism and doesnt have a strong feel for what bears do all day.

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A pot dealer and a crew of misfits pose as a suburban family to make a cross-border drug run. Rated R BOTTOM LINE This family-values comedy in disguise could have been edgy and even endearing -- so why all the icky sexual humor? The charming cast particularly Aniston is ill used. CAST Jason Sudeikis Jennifer Aniston Emma Roberts LENGTH 150 In ""Were the Millers"" Jason Sudeikis plays David Clark a familiar man-boy still sporting the jeans sneakers and backpack of his youth -- but with a twist. In that backpack are the days marijuana drops. While his friends have moved on to spouses kids and minivans David is still an unattached carefree pot dealer. Its an interesting setup for what turns out to be a family-values comedy in disguise. When Davids supplier (Ed Helms playing against type as a sneering fat cat) forces him to haul an RV full of drugs over the Mexican border David recruits a fake family as his disguise. A stripper named Rose (Jennifer Aniston) becomes his wife while latchkey kid Kenny (Will Poulter) and teen runaway Casey (Emma Roberts) will be their kids. A few Supercuts later the ""Millers"" are born. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? ""Were the Millers"" directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber (""Dodgeball A True Underdog Story"") has many good ideas beginning with the counter-casting of Aniston Americas sweetheart as a stripper (surely a widespread male fantasy). Poulter as a naive teenager and Sudeikis playing a flippant hipster in the Bill Murray mold form something like a father-son bond. As our misfit heroes form their own cohesive unit there are one or two endearing moments. But the movie too often goes for icky sexual humor. David sacrifices Kenny to a predatory gay cop Casey kisses her ""brother"" and Rose is frequently slurred as ""cheap"" and ""dirty."" Nick Offerman and Kathryn Hahn play a seemingly straight couple with various kinks. We would still care despite all the raunch if ""Were the Millers"" werent so thinly written (by two comedy duos from ""Wedding Crashers"" and ""Hot Tub Time Machine""). Whats accidentally interesting about ""Were the Millers"" is its politics. Like most romantic comedies it pushes a conservative agenda of romance and the nuclear family as everyone subconsciously falls into ""normal"" patterns of behavior. (""Ill turn this RV around and drive straight home"" David threatens. ""No drugs for anyone"") But the movie also takes a laissez-faire view up to a point of narcotics with David portrayed not as a sleazeball but as a kind of friendly neighborhood milkman (one of his customers is a suburban mommy). A smarter more thoughtful comedy could have made something interesting out of this material but ""Were the Millers"" takes the easy route. PLOT A pot dealer and a crew of misfits pose as a suburban family to make a cross-border drug run.

CRAZY Jennifer Aniston plays a stripper playing a mom alongside Jason Sudekis in Were the Millers (Michael Tackett) B Were the Millers Genre Comedy; Starring Jennifer Aniston Ed Helms Jason Sudeikis Emma Roberts; Director Rawson Marshall Thurber; Release Date Wide 08/09/2013; Runtime (in minutes) 109; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted August 19 2013 -- 1200 AM EDT Maybe leaving Saturday Night Live wasnt such a bad idea for Jason Sudeikis after all. In the raunchy road-trip comedy Were the Millers the actor best known for his gonzo late-night riffs on Mitt Romney and Joe Biden proves that he can do more than just mug through five-minute skits. He may never become an A-list force at the box office on par with Adam Sandler or Will Ferrell but hes unlikely to pull a Joe Piscopo vanishing act. It certainly doesnt hurt that in his first starring role hes paired with a hit-the-mark pro like Jennifer Aniston who delivered one of her best -- and bawdiest -- turns alongside Sudeikis in 2011s Horrible Bosses. Directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber (Dodgeball A True Underdog Story) Millers centers on an aging Denver pot dealer (Sudeikis) whos on the hook to his weaselly supplier (Ed Helms) for 43000. To settle the debt he has to smuggle a ""smidge"" (in reality several hundred pounds) of weed over the border from Mexico. As a cover he enlists his stripper neighbor (Aniston) a gutterpunk teen (Emma Roberts) and an Opielooking dork (scene-stealer Will Poulter) to pose as a square RV-driving Cleaveresque family. Before it fizzles out with a predictably redemptive ending Millers serves up some delightfully lewd laughs such as Roberts teaching her ""brother"" how to kiss as ""Mom"" and ""Dad"" cheer her on. While Aniston shows that shes as deft on a stripper pole as she is with her sitcom-honed timing Sudeikis wields his smart-ass sarcasm like a barbed weapon. And more often than not it kills.

"Were the Millers Review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Were the Millers stripped of humor  1/2 Elysium is sharp and atmospheric; Were the Millers not so much ""Reel Thursdays with Michael Phillips.""Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips praises ""Elysium"" and names ""Were the Millers"" one to avoid. (Posted on August 8 2013) ""Reel Thursdays with Michael Phillips."" Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips praises ""Elysium"" and names ""Were the Millers"" one to avoid. (Posted on August 8 2013) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune When Jason Sudeikis and Ed Helms appear in the same movie theres a significant threat of clean-cut sameness. Mediocre material makes them like two halves of the same comic actor Ed Jason Helms-Sudeikis.This is true even when they are playing different sorts of characters. In the strenuous new comedy ""Were the Millers"" which sounds a little too close to ""Did You Hear About the Morgans?"" for comfort Sudeikis plays David Clark an easygoing Denver marijuana dealer the envy of all his pathetic married friends. He lives in the same apartment building as a pristinely hard-bitten stripper Rose portrayed by Jennifer Aniston. She receives top billing; she looks nice as a stripper; she continues to take movie roles that very likely make her long for the days of ""Friends."" Helms character tiptoes around the edges of the story as one of the dealers big clients who strong-arms Clark into becoming a drug mule. To cross the U.S./Mexico border undetected the dealer not wanting to work alone hires the stripper and two teenagers -- wised-up runaway Casey played by Emma Roberts and wide-eyed naif Kenny played by Will Poulter -- to pose as a model family of four. Theyre the Millers and the pot theyre lugging is Mexican cartel pot which means trouble. This being a 21st-century ""action comedy"" it also means the usual amount of ill-considered violence that takes away from the funny rather than adding to it.Its not a bad setup; its ""2 Guns"" retold as a second-rate ""National Lampoons Vacation"" sequel. But theres something a little (or a lot) off with nearly everything in ""Were the Millers"" directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber who did ""Dodgeball"" and the watery indie ""The Mysteries of Pittsburgh."" The crux of the humor depends on the Sudeikis and Aniston characters bickering in a way that spells l-o-v-e but the screenplay spells it a-g-g-r-a-v-a-t-i-o-n instead. The hoped-for big payoffs of brazen comic effrontery fall eerily flat. One features Nick Offerman and Kathryn Hahn (no slouches) as a square-seeming vacationing couple who end up in the Millers tent for what they think will be a foursie with Hahns hands on Anistons component parts while the men ogle. The other finds Poulters virginal teen (the freshest element in the film) receiving make-out lessons from both his fake mother Aniston and his fake sister Roberts. Watching this bit you think Huh?

Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated Tuesday August 6 2013 1201 AM Title Were the Millers Film Info R Sexuality language drug humor. Area theaters. Opens Tuesday night. Summertime. Road trip. Jennifer Aniston as a stripper. What could go wrong? Plenty as it turns out in ""Were the Millers"" the latest attempt by the former ""Friends"" star and patron saint of rom-coms to sauce up her image. Luckily our Miss Jen has Jason Sudeikis smarm-smile to aid her along with her own willingness to be sassy. But the ""Millers"" script -- it took four writers to cobble together something that seems so slight -- hits too many obvious notes between the moments when Aniston can strut her stuff. Sudeikis plays Dave Clark a low-level dope dealer who seems to have successfully avoided growing up by perpetually acting like a college kid. Now solidly in his 30s hes an easy mark for some kids who roll him one night stealing his stash. His supplier (Ed Helms going goofy-dark) makes Dave work off what he owes by driving to Mexico to bring back a huge delivery of weed through customs. Since he has an RV to carry it Dave has to fill the ride with humans to provide cover. So he rounds up a rogues gallery of neighbors in his apartment building and turns them into a fake family with stripper Rose (Aniston) as his wife and a dork and a runaway (Will Poulter Emma Roberts) as their kids. Jennifer Aniston and Jason Sudeikis star in Were the Millers. Family vacations are bad enough to begin with but Dave has no idea how much this phony one will get on his nerves. The movie gets on ours eventually. Though it sometimes can outrun gags you see coming a mile away (whod have guessed this dysfunctional ""family"" would squabble like a real one? Or that theyd develop a depth of feeling for each other?) the trip gets irritating. A few supporting performances shine including Nick Offerman and Kathryn Hahn as two would-be-swingin vacationers and Roberts whose turn as a sneery punkette is enjoyably tossed-off. And there are fun small touches to push through like a clueless Dave reading a Wikipedia entry on ""drug smuggling"" on his iPhone. Aniston seems a little beyond this stuff. She was similarly too willing to bust loose in ""Wanderlust"" ""The Bounty Hunter"" and ""Horrible Bosses."" While shes best when off-kilter (""The Good Girl"" and ""Office Space"" remain her big-screen high points) ""Millers"" uses her skill at being petulant-proud toward an edge thats not there. Emma Roberts and Will Poulter play the kids in the Millers faux family with Jennifer Aniston and Jason Sudeikis. Whereas the mellow Sudeikis doesnt need to go far to find his inner mock-slime Aniston -- once and forever Americas favorite ex-girlfriend -- is doing the movie equivalent of a pole dance after too many drinks. She has about one and a half scenes of stripper action and while she looks great the self-parody kills the fun. You may not want her to stop right away but chances are shell regret this down the road. On mobile?

Do you find insults revolving around the words Marky Mark churros and/or YOLO hilarious? How about the notion of a dorky white kid flawlessly rapping TLCs ""Waterfalls""? (Poulter sells the gag beautifully though; the young British actor is the movies single bright spot.) When you watch most mainstream comedies do you find yourself thinking Man this really needs way more gratuitous profanity? Are you still under the impression that Aniston is A-list movie-star material? Would you be able to tolerate most anything just so you could watch the Friends actress do a striptease to Aerosmiths ""Sweet Emotion"" in a grimy spark-filled auto shop like some sort of 80s music-video vixen? Or put up with any of the above to see a close-up of a testicle swollen from a tarantula bite? Should you have answered yes to any of those queries then by all means enjoy this cavalcade of road-movie conventions digs at square RV owners and gay Mexican cops late-act life lessons and conspicuously obscene bantering. (Memo to filmmakers I love vulgarity and bad words as much as the next motherfucker but can you please stop mistaking crassness for actual comedy?) The rest of us will just be left to puzzle over Anistons exhibitionism obsession and pray that Sudeikiss smirking-douche leading-man shtick wont constitute his entire post-SNL career.

Michael Tackett This film image released by Warner Bros. Entertainment shows from left Jennifer Aniston Will Poulter Emma Roberts and Jason Sudeikis in a scene from ""Were the Millers."" (AP Photo/Warner Bros. Entertainment Michael Tackett) Its been an especially bad season for Mexican movie villains. South-of-the-border banditos have endured a burglary by Mr. Chow in ""The Hangover Part III"" the humiliation of running a mall restaurant in ""Despicable Me 2"" and a double-cross by buddy cops in ""2 Guns."" Now Mexican drug lords are forced to tussle with wannabe suburbanites in the wretched road-trip comedy ""Were the Millers.""The titular family isnt really a family at all but a small-time drug smuggling operation. David (Jason Sudeikis) is a 30-something pot dealer in Denver whose cash and his stash are stolen by muggers.His cartoonishly corporate supplier (Ed Helms) offers to forgive Davids debt -- and spare his life -- if he transports a load of marijuana across the border from Mexico. For the role of an inconspicuously wholesome family in an RV friendless David recruits some equally rootless acquaintances principled stripper Rose (Jennifer Aniston) nerdy virgin Kenny (Will Poulter) and cynical runaway Casey (Emma Roberts).The script by the once-promising writers of ""Wedding Crashers"" is in such a hurry to reach the scene where Aniston strips to get the gang out of trouble that it barely mentions the teenagers real parents. It also detours around the ostensible climax where the nervous smugglers pass through the U.S. border checkpoint with a ton of weed.Yet theres an interminable scene where the two males in the vehicle negotiate whos going to gratify a corrupt cop (Luis Rodriguez). And the segment of the movie in which a vacationing DEA agent (Nick Offerman) his wife (Kathryn Hahn) and their daughter (Molly Quinn) experiment sexually with the Millers lasts longer than a bad acid trip. But in the end this otherwise forgettable film is all about the booty -- specifically Anistons which she shimmies and shakes to distract the Mexican kingpin (Tomer Sisley) whose merchandise the Millers misappropriated.For her ""Flashdance""-inspired striptease Aniston clearly worked a lot harder than anyone else associated with this slacker catastrophe. Wed have to be stoned to be interested in these characters or to be surprised when they form a surrogate family just in time for the blooper reel.

"Review Were the Millers cant fake the laughs - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Were the Millers cant fake the laughs Were the Millers Michael Tackett / Warner Bros. Emma Roberts Jennifer Aniston Jason Sudeikis background right and Will Poulter in a scene from ""Were the Millers."" Emma Roberts Jennifer Aniston Jason Sudeikis background right and Will Poulter in a scene from ""Were the Millers."" (Michael Tackett / Warner Bros.) Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Lets start with the story behind ""Were the Millers"" the new comedy starring Jennifer Aniston and Jason Sudeikis.The writers of the very funny ""Wedding Crashers"" Bob Fisher and Steve Faber came up with the idea and wrote the first drafts of ""The Millers"" about a small-time drug dealer who uses a fake family as cover for one major score. Sean Anders and John Morris who crafted ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" -- also funny also raunchy -- finished the script. Whats mystifying is why anyone thought combining these two writing teams sensibilities made sense.PHOTOS Jennifer Aniston gets her Hollywood star Each pair has different ways of constructing a comic moment. ""Wedding Crashers"" emerged from the philosophy that you are responsible for your own havoc. ""Hot Tub"" amused by putting its characters at the mercy of unfortunate events.Its true that director Rawson Marshall Thurbers high point thus far 2004s ""Dodgeball"" is something of a hybrid of the styles. But ""Were the Millers"" is full of moments that feel as forced as the marriage of convenience -- and contrivance -- in the movie.That doesnt mean ""Millers"" is not occasionally funny -- it is. Or that the performances are awful -- they arent. The idea of a road trip in an RV loaded with high-octane pot and a pretend family certainly has some R-rated comic promise.The film starts small in Denver where David (Sudeikis) is still selling drugs out of his backpack years after his college dorm start. Hes got the same look too -- longish hair day-old scruff worn jeans -- and an equally laid-back clientele of soccer moms and the like. Rose (Aniston) is a stripper with yes a heart of gold who lives in his apartment building. They snipe at the mailbox over the money her boyfriend owes him for drugs so you can see right away the road-trip fights possible with these two.VIDEO Upcoming summer filmsKenny (Will Poulter) the nerdy teen who lives downstairs sets things in motion. Hes ill-equipped for life and hardly ready for battle and his attempt to rescue a street kid named Casey (Emma Roberts) demands David step in and save the day. Instead his drugs and money are snatched and his supplier a big-deal jerk played by Ed Helms offers to wipe the slate clean if hell make a quick run to Mexico to pick up some weed.David may be a low-level dealer but hes not an idiot. As the movie finally gets underway hes feeling hopeless Caseys homeless Kennys clueless and Rose is about to be jobless.Until David alights on the idea that an ""all-American"" family is the perfect front for drug smuggling. Now he just has to get one.The dealer the stripper and the punk-pierced runaway are soon cleaned up and repackaged as a white-bread clan on a family trip. Kenny already fits the bill.The movie quickly settles into the well-covered terrain of most road movies -- the friction that comes with putting humans in confined spaces for long hours especially when the RV breaks down.The smuggling twist is there to theoretically add some tension. It does succeed in putting two bad guys -- One-Eye (Matthew Willig) and Pablo (Tomer Sisley) -- on their trail and provides an excuse to throw in every south-of-the-border stereotype imaginable.PHOTOS Movie Sneaks 2013The underlying idea is that in pretending to be a family the Millers will actually become a real family. The comedy is embedded in all the various conflicts theyre forced to work through.Unfortunately many of the jokes implode. The one that involves Rose proving she really is a stripper vies with Kennys spider-bite incident for most absurd. The running gag with a little bundle of joy provides the most laughs. The detour to deal with the wife-swapping couple is downright weird.Some of the family-bonding bits are nice -- Aniston is good at soothing ruffled feathers particularly when the kids are involved. And Roberts is believable as a kid whod love a real family. But the relationships arent developed enough to cover the shortcomings.The movies biggest problem is in its central casting choice. Sudeikis and Aniston are likable in such similar ways -- their self-deprecating charm understated comic delivery girl- and guy-next-door good looks fundamental decency. Its as if the actors actually came from the same stable sweet heartland family. But they are definitely not the Millers.Funny man Sudeikis is still in need to a film role that improves on or differs from the ""Saturday Night Live"" gig he only recently left. And for Aniston if you were hoping for a well-crafted comedy that suits and stretches the popular ""Friends"" alum creatively -- more along the lines of 2002s ""The Good Girl"" or 2006s ""Friends With Money"" than 2010s ""The Bounty Hunter"" or 2011s ""Horrible Bosses"" (which didnt serve Sudeikis well either) -- the wait continues. If however youve been dying to see how Aniston would handle a stripper pole ""Were the Millers"" might be just what youre looking for.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com ---------------------------------Were the MillersMPAA rating R for crude sexual content pervasive language drug material and brief graphic nudityRunning time 1 hour 39 minutesPlaying In general release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Organized Crime Entertainment Movies Jennifer Aniston Jason Sudeikis Were the Millers Sports Were the Millers Jennifer Aniston Jason Sudeikis on twisted road Jason Sudeikis trades TV for film with Were the Millers Jennifer Aniston strips in Were the Millers trailer Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad84deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-were-the-millers-20130807,0,2619079.story",200,we'rethemillers32,we'rethemillers,latimes

Youd think Jennifer Aniston would be familiar with the command ""Never go full retard"" since it appeared in ""Tropic Thunder"" a movie co-written by her boyfriend Justin Theroux. In ""Were the Millers"" though everyone goes full ""retard"" while playing famously brain-damaged folk Ordinary suburban Americans. In other words Hollywoods customers. Well see whos the genius when the grosses come in I guess. The film is about three unrelated dirtbags and a dork who find themselves playing (i.e. hugely overplaying) a normal suburban family while carrying a load of marijuana back from Mexico in an RV. But -- Jason Sudeikis in the lead? As a drug dealer who could never hope to pass for a picket-fence type? Please the man looks like he was born in a Lands End catalog. And to be his pretend wife a skank who would seem hopelessly out of place in a sitcom? They picked Aniston. Hiring a thieving runaway (Emma Roberts) and a flustered boy (Will Poulter) to play their kids David (Sudeikis) and Rose (Aniston) agree to pick up (2 tons of) weed in Mexico and drive it to Denver to placate a scary drug lord. Hes played by -- who else? -- Ed Helms. I can picture Ed Helms climbing to the top of the drug business about as easily as I can picture him in the Victorias Secret catalog. The movie directed by the formerly promising Rawson Marshall Thurber (the hilarious ""Dodgeball"" and the awful ""The Mysteries of Pittsburgh"") thinks its subverting the conventions of the sitcom with a revolutionary new idea which is Do everything exactly the way a sitcom would plus lots of swearing and dirty jokes. So Carrying 2 tons of pot naturally the ""Millers"" find themselves getting chatted up by another RV couple (Kathryn Hahn Nick Offerman). Guess what? The hubby is a DEA agent. And due to a wacky misunderstanding theres almost an orgy. Were only halfway through the movie when the capital-M sitcom Moments begin -- strummy guitar music ""Dad"" teaching ""Son"" about how not to be shy with girls. As for Anistons much-hyped stripping routine (down to her undies) which befuddles a fierce drug dealer who has apparently never seen boobies before its as sad as her hula dance in ""Just Go With It."" For young actresses to disrobe in exchange for attention is tradition. For 44-year-olds its desperation.

""Were the Millers"" is about four unfortunate individuals tricked into going on an excruciating road trip in exchange for a hefty payday a description that is offered here less as plot summary than as a possible explanation for why the actors look so trapped. Probably the worst movie to prominently feature an RV since ""RV"" this tiresomely vulgar outing throws together a drug dealer a stripper two teens a testicle-biting tarantula a gaggle of gun-waving Mexican stereotypes and scarcely a single laugh amid all the ensuing pot-smuggling booty-shaking heart-tugging shenanigans. ""Were the Filler"" might have been a more apt title for Warners mid-August dud which should run out of B.O. gas once word gets out.This story first appeared in the August 06 2013 issue of Variety. Subscribe today.See more. Jennifer Aniston and Jason Sudeikis barely shared any screentime in the much funnier ""Horrible Bosses"" a situation that has been rather dubiously rectified in this vehicle helmed by Rawson Marshall Thurber (the much funnier ""Dodgeball"") and written by the dual duos of Bob Fisher and Steve Faber (the much funnier ""Wedding Crashers"") and Sean Anders and John Morris (the much funnier ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" but also the similarly unfunny ""Sex Drive""). Sudeikis plays David Clark a smart-alecky Denver bachelor who makes a living selling marijuana out of his backpack to a largely upper-middle-class clientele. His job gets a lot tougher when he loses 43000 worth of cash and contraband to local thugs leaving him at the mercy of his slick obscenely wealthy supplier (Ed Helms) who orders him to go down Mexico way pick up his latest shipment and bring it safely across the border -- or else. David concludes the only way hell make it past the border guards and their pot-sniffing pooches is by renting a motor home and pretending to be a squeaky-clean all-American family man passing through on his way home from a trip with his wife and kids. To pull this off hell need a convincing-looking family and so with the promise of mucho moolah he gets his neighbor down-on-her-luck stripper Rose (Aniston) to pose as his adoring wife -- which proves a challenge since the two can barely stand each other. Casey (Emma Roberts) the surly teenage runaway who agrees to play their daughter isnt crazy about them either. The only one genuinely happy to be along for the ride is their ""son"" Kenny (Will Poulter) a sweet awkward kid who naturally endures the brunt of the pics humiliations once the Millers as they call themselves fly down to New Mexico and head south of the border. These include encounters with the aforementioned spider necessitating some hideously convincing swollen-scrotum prosthetics as well as a portly gay cop (Luis Guzman) who demands a bribe in exchange for overlooking the two metric tons of marijuana they have stashed aboard their RV. And then theres Don and Edie Fitzgerald (Nick Offerman and Kathryn Hahn) an ingratiatingly folksy salt-of-the-earth couple who are on vacation with their daughter (Molly Quinn) and who insist on spending as much time with the Millers as possible. Even a premise this stupidly contrived stands a fair chance of working if there are a few decent yuks to be had but absent any such inspiration ""Were the Millers"" falls back on the sort of lazy but desperate sexually fixated non sequiturs that have become de rigueur in studio comedies jabbing repeatedly at the human groin in hopes of eventually hitting something funny. Thus Edie offers up unsolicited information about her odd genital condition and mispronounces the word ""tampon"" a bit of comedic foreplay leading up to a mirthless cringe-inducing scene in which she and her husband mistake Mr. and Mrs. Miller for a couple of swingers. Just as misguided is the scripts suggestion that these four mismatched misfits are in fact lonely hurting individuals who wouldnt you know just need some semblance of a family unit in order to meet their neglected emotional needs. As they shoulder the burden of turning this wannabe-dark comedy into a strained exercise in uplift the actors become especially sympathetic -- none more so than Aniston who proves far more game than the material deserves especially when shes forced to deliver a slow-motion striptease for the benefit of a Mexican drug lord (Tomer Sisley) a weirdly conflicted scene in which the film seems to be pitying mocking and exploiting her all at once. Hahns high-pitched squeals and Offermans soft-spoken sensitivity come off as more sweet and endearing than creepy in the long run; Roberts is unremarkably sullen and British thesp Poulter proves a very good sport with his eager-to-please routine. As the resourceful jerk who sets everything in motion Sudeikis brings his usual energetic fast-talking comic bravado to the party though Davids snarky one-liners about everything from LeBron James to Banes voice in ""The Dark Knight Rises"" feel hardly worth the actors efforts. Elsewhere the pics pop-culture references tilt decidedly 90s perhaps signaled by the presence of Aniston (""Friends"" gets a shoutout in the end-credits bloopers) and borne out by an impromptu but depressingly forced group sing-along to TLCs ""Waterfalls."" Shot in North Carolina and New Mexico the pic is adequately assembled. Film Review Were the MillersReviewed at Warner Bros. Studios Burbank Calif. July 31 2013.

This was HILARIOUS for 100 minutes with the crowd laughing its heart out... You guys need to be back to Earth ... Your supposedly bad word-of mouth is giving first place to the Millers over M. Damon this week stateside.... Reply terry says August 13 2013 at 910 pm I read in a few places where Angelina Jolie who definately has the connections and power will have media and film critics print unfavorable comments reviews etc. about anything that has to do with Jennifer Anniston. Are you one of those? Reply honeybunn says August 9 2013 at 905 pm the same creeps on this blog that think 40 is over the hill need their heads examined. there are plenty of actresses over forty and I dont see these ugly comments about them. youll are jealous jen haters. I just saw we are the millers and it is definitely a hit comedy. Jennifer and jason s performance was superb. this comedy is the hit of the summer. jennifer is so gorgeous and her body was flawless. why are some people so ignorant. Reply Slim says August 7 2013 at 1209 pm Jchang you must be tired of all the cgi and cartoon movies youv watched. This is a fun summer movie enjoy it for what it is. Reply Bill says August 7 2013 at 147 am Whats going on in Justin Changs life that makes him so ornery? All I can say is a saw this film earlier tonight with a reasonably full theater of other people and everyone seemed to enjoy it immensely laughing throughout. It wasnt perfect but I suspect it should do reasonably well and make a tidy profit if the production budget wasnt allowed to spin out of control. For anyone who thinks Aniston is ""too old"" to play a stripper there are millions of men who think otherwise; she looks absolutely incredible here. Reply Mark O says August 6 2013 at 725 pm Just putting Jennifer Aniston on the screen does not make something interesting. Just being vulgar does not make something funny. Reply dee says August 6 2013 at 211 pm So Anniston plays a 40 year old stripper? ok......Only in Hollywood Reply Patrice Atiee says August 6 2013 at 839 am The marketing alone was repulsive enough to detour ticket sales. Reply jansa says August 6 2013 at 619 am love to be a critic sit on the side line and crit everybody but cannot do any thing themselves. just like a fan at soccer or rugby all mouth but would get his ass kicked on the field. thank heavens people pay little attention to critics always found movies they say are bad to be fun and interesting to the general public. as for the jen haters get a life and see if you can do better if you dont like her movies dont watch . love comedy and maybe the american public only like violent movies and have no sense of humor will wait and see for myself not a mindless zombie that listens to other people. . Reply CF says August 28 2013 at 143 pm jansa The guys a movie critic and as such watches movies and critiques them. Youre not owed a good review. Get over it. Reply Renee Weisband says August 6 2013 at 427 am I felt that way just looking at previews Reply Just Confused says August 5 2013 at 1041 pm I have to agree with GRACE. It gets harder and harder to be ""HOT"" after 40...and SHE IS isnt she NOW how about getting INTERESTING.....would that be too big a challenge? or am I..... Reply Spike says August 5 2013 at 1031 pm Sounds like the 4 writers smoked too much dope when they wrote it. they would probably laugh at a yellow pages house painting ad. As to pot theres nothing funny about it. The THC in dope these days is 100 times stronger than the THC content of dope in the 60s. So now even smoking one joint causes brain damage. Pot comedies are the last resort of writers out of ideas. If theyre hacks let them write MacDonalds commercials. Save the millions of studio bucks for something worthwhile. Reply grace says August 5 2013 at 1015 pm How does Aniston keep getting cast in these roles? She is no longer pert or cute she is not sexy in a Megan Fox way. Her acting skills are rehashed and retrashed in the same type of role over and over again. Either she needs new representation or someone needs to sit her down and explain the role of a cable series in her future. Reply honeybunn says August 9 2013 at 913 pm And why do you keep commenting on blogs for Aniston if you are a hater. I guess I just answered my own question you are just a hater. She has never been cute she is and always have been gorgeous. Reply The Kingslayer says August 6 2013 at 1218 pm Millions of men across the world disagree with you. Reply Rom M. says August 14 2013 at 209 pm +1 Mick says August 7 2013 at 841 pm And tens of millions of men and women agree with grace. Jen has passed her sell by date.

Daily Edition Login to download Were the Millers Film Review 1000 PM PDT 8/5/2013 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS Rote comedy of lowlifes posing as a happy family to smuggle drugs can hope its crudeness will spark late summer interest. TWITTER Jason Sudeikis and Jennifer Aniston star as neer-do-well bottom-feeders posing as a couple in an effort to smuggle drugs into the U.S. Were the Millers is vulgar vanilla a ""family"" comedy about a bunch of would-be golly-gee squares who talk dirty and get involved with Mexican drug dealers because its 2013 instead of 1953. An inane little time-killer with enough low laughs to placate undemanding audiences this Warner Bros. release could rake in some decent quick returns and good ancillary results if at least part of the public that made The Heat such a hit becomes convinced that this is just the R-rated romp it needs to bookend the summer with another shot of crude comedy. The whole joke here is that ""the Millers"" are an invention a white-bread middle-class RV-dwelling family of four that represents the traditional American ideal when in fact theyre a bunch of neer-do-well bottom-feeders thrown together in the hopes of righting the capsized ships their lives have become. PHOTOS 26 of Summers Most Anticipated Movies Not that theyre really bad sorts of course just victims of their own low horizons and not getting their acts together. David (Jason Sudeikis) is still the loosey-goosey neighborhood pot dealer he was in college. After being robbed of all hes worth hes also susceptible to the entreaties of his loaded old pal and supplier Brad (an over-the-top Ed Helms) to work as a mule to bring a ""smidge"" of drugs back to Denver from south of the border. The idea as concocted by two separate screenwriting teams Bob Fisher and Steve Faber (The Wedding Crashers) and Sean Anders and John Morris (Hot Tub Time Machine) is for David to recruit three likely suspects who will help him form a straight-arrow family so normal and Norman Rockwell-looking that authorities will wave their spiffy motor home right over the border without a thought. According to time-tested romantic comedy formula the woman he finds to pose as his wife must hate him the better to warm to him later so of course the job falls to local stripper Rose (Jennifer Aniston) who may well be the least convincing down-and-out bump-and-grinder in screen history. All of about five seconds are devoted to showing Rose at work going through her motions wearing far more than most soccer moms usually wear at public swimming pools and the idea that a woman this well groomed and so obviously middle-class would have been plying this trade for 20 years and still look like this defies even a generous extension of disbelief. This is the sort of role -- a woman whos had some hard knocks but still retains her smarts and sass -- that Barbara Stanwyck excelled at in the old days and lets just say that Aniston is no Stanwyck. Also scrubbing up for the ride are snide street punk Casey (Emma Roberts) and a teenage sad sack from Davids apartment building Kenny (Will Poulter). The women on board can barely stand to be around the interminably upbeat David who after a haircut is very convincing as a Midwestern-style dork. As predicted theyre practically given a royal escort into Mexico and shortly find the fortress compound of their contact (Tomer Sisley) and his towering one-eyed henchman (Matthew Willig). The heat is finally turned up a notch when the smidge theyre to transport turns out to be a stash that would have kept The Dude aloft for life. With drugs packed into every corner and crevice of the RV they head back on a perilous journey thats moderately enlivened when theyre helped out by a solicitous Middle American family the Fitzgeralds (Nick Offerman and Kathryn Hahn) to whom the ""Millers"" have to be convincing as a real family. Shy virgin Kenny gets some amusing coaching on how to romance the Fitzgeralds equally bashful daughter (Molly Quinn) while the funniest stuff stems from a misunderstanding that initiates an almost-group encounter among the four adults that has Hahn doing to Aniston what Leslie Mann did to Megan Fox in This Is 40. VIDEO Were The Millers Trailer Jennifer Aniston Smuggles Drugs The films slyest performance comes from Offerman as Don Fitzgerald a DEA veteran whos as straight-shooting and affable a guy as you could want to meet unless you happen to be transporting millions in drugs. Like many a classic farce this trifle swings on concealed identities people not being what they seem a myriad of close calls and as many plot twists and turns as it takes to make everything work out in the end. Returning to the broad comedy strokes of his debut feature Dodgeball A True Underdog Story after a detour with the seriously under-realized The Mysteries of Pittsburgh director Rawson Marshall Thurber adequately manages the mechanics demanded here but adds no finesse or grace notes. Sudeikis is very broad and one-note as a Waspy schlub whose enthusiasm is equaled only by his obnoxiousness. Without a breath at the end the film breaks into a succession of not very funny outtakes. ""Oscars for all of you"" Hahn roars to the others at one point. Theyd better not start hoping. Opens Aug. 10 (Warner Bros.)

By ending with outtakes that wind up being the funniest part of the film ""Were the Millers"" basically confesses that its talented cast - led by Jason Sudeikis Jennifer Aniston Emma Roberts Nick Offerman and Kathryn Hahn - would have been much better off untethered from the pedestrian screenplay. It took four writers to labor over this unremarkable piece of work and somehow not one of them could figure out a way to mine laughs from a tarantula biting a teenagers scrotum. See video Jennifer Aniston Strips Her Way Out of Trouble in Were the Millers Red Band Trailer The premise shows promise Small-time drug dealer David (Sudeikis) gets robbed of his cash and his stash after he and his nerdy neighbor Kenny (U.K. actor Will Poulter) try to come to the rescue of homeless teen Casey (Roberts). Davids druglord boss Brad (Ed Helms) may be a total nerd but hes not amused over the money David owes him; he does however offer to let David off the hook if the dealer will become a smuggler and bring a ""smidge and a half"" of marijuana back to Denver over the Mexican border. Figuring that white-bread families never attract the attention of the law David recruits Kenny and Casey to pretend to be his kids while hiring Rose (Aniston) - the stripper next door who hates him but needs the money - to throw on some capri pants and sensible shoes to pass as his wife so the ersatz ""Millers"" can drive an RV packed with dope through customs with no one giving them a second look. Also read The Canyons Review A Hollywood Tale Tailor-Made for Todays Lindsay Lohan Naturally nothing goes as planned but almost none of the catastrophes the group encounters are particularly funny whether its a horny Mexican cop (Luis Guzman) or a seemingly bland couple (Offerman and Hahn) with some secrets of their own. The movie flaunts its R-rated-ness in a few moments of daring (an innocent bystander catches Rose and Casey giving virginal Kenny kissing lessons and assumes its incest) but ""Were the Millers"" has its heart firmly in the Eisenhower-era nuclear family with David Rose Casey and Kenny learning that they need each other and that playing house is stirring all their pangs for suburban domesticity. Aniston gets a few moments of comic flair switching gears from hard-bitten bar girl to you-betcha housewife in the blink of an eye but her character exists in that bizarro movie world (previously seen in ""The Internship"" and ""Rock of Ages"" among many others) where all strippers wear bras throughout their routines. Journeyman director Rawson Marshall Thurber (""Dodgeball A True Underdog Story""  ""The Mysteries of Pittsburgh"") shows no feel for timing with scenes running well past their point of expiration and the movie as a whole lasting a seemingly endless 110 minutes. At a total of 15 respectable laughs thats a sad average of one chuckle every seven or eight minutes. If August is when the studios do a summer-clearance-sale purge of their least marketable product do yourself a favor and leave ""Were the Millers"" on the rack. Breaking News To Your Inbox.
