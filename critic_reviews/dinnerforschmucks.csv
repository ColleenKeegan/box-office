But a good dickey joke? Now theres a rarity. There are actually two stellar dickey jokes -- both visual gags involving the bib-like false shirt-fronts and funny man Zach Galifianakis -- in ""Dinner for Schmucks."" They are the best and only subtle jokes in the entire movie. Of course theres a dick joke built right into the title of the film given that the literal translation for ""schmuck"" a Yiddish word is ""penis."" Schmuck is not at least where I grew up a word you toss around in polite company. Its use in the title of the movie is indicative of both this particular films mandate and Hollywoods in general when it comes to adapting a foreign comedy Make it broader and preferably cruder. ""Dinner for Schmucks"" is the latest in a long line of French comedies that have been retooled for American audiences. It is an adaption of director-writer Francis Vebers 1998 film ""Le Dinner de Cons"" (""Dinner With Idiots"") which was released in the U.S. as ""The Dinner Game."" (Vebers film was based on his own play of the same name.) Most of these French films including ""Dinner Game"" werent masterpieces to begin with. Dumb is dumb no matter which side of the Atlantic you live on. (Sidenote I grew up reading Vincent Canby in the New York Times but learned quickly after following his enthusiastic recommendations regarding several truly dumb French comedies that this usually discerning critic had a notable weakness for giddy Gallic farces. Every critic has an Achilles heel; this was his.) The English-language remakes of dumb French comedies usually only make matters worse by liberally applying yellow hi-lighter to every character and joke. The sexy femme fatale in the French version becomes a predatory lunatic nymphomaniac in the Hollywood one. For every ""Down and Out in Beverly Hills"" (the clever 1986 adaptation of Jean Renoirs 1932 classic ""Boudu Saved From Drowning"") there have been a half dozen lesser attempts at American-izing comedies of French origin. Anyone remember ""The Man With One Red Shoe"" (pictured) ""Three Men and a Baby"" ""The Woman in Red"" ""Cousins"" ""Jungle 2 Jungle"" and ""Fathers Day"" all made in the last quarter century? Not a one is worth seeing a second time though ""Three Men"" certainly impressed at the box office. Then again neither are the French originals with the exception of 1975s ""Cousine Cousin"" the appealing French film of which ""Cousins"" was a remake. That goes for ""Dinner for Schmucks"" as well made even dopier and more mawkish. Paul Rudd plays Tim Conrad an investment advisor on the make whose boss invites him to a dinner where each guest is instructed to bring along -- without revealing why theyve been invited -- a spectacularly foolish person. At the end of the evening a mocking award will be handed to the biggest ""idiot."" Tim soon runs into (literally with his car; subtle this movie is not) Barry Speck (Steve Carell) an IRS employee who spends his spare time creating twee tableaux using dead stuffed mice dressed up as humans. Obviously Barry a true naif is the perfect guest for Tim to bring to the dinner. Many allegedly hilarious adventures ensue during which Barry with the best of intentions but the worst of instincts manages royally to mess up Tims life. It all culminates at the titular dinner party a scene full of food fights slapstick humor and general mayhem little of it very funny. Tellingly in the French movie the hero and his foolish pal never make it the actual dinner. Director Jay Roach (""The Fockers"") who has never boasted an especially light touch seems particularly heavy-handed here. Jokes are laboriously set up for pay-offs that rarely seem worth the bother. Not even the food looks particularly appetizing. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Dinner for Schmucks (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Dinner for Schmucks (PG-13) The cast cant save feeble comedy. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald7/28/2010 Editor rating 2 Supper comes surprisingly late in Dinner for Schmucks. This loose - extremely loose - remake of Francis Vebers French-language 1998 farce The Dinner Game radically departs from the original film which took place almost entirely during the eponymous meal. The change was not necessarily bad. Funny as it was Vebers film became a bit claustrophobic after a while. But the scenarios screenwriters David Guion and Michael Handelman have created for Dinner for Schmucks director Jay Roach (Meet the Parents Austin Powers) are weak and uninventive. Although the cast tries mightily to keep the humor spinning the laughs are disappointingly sparse. Paul Rudd reprises the same type of character hes been playing for years Tim a nice easygoing guy eager to land a recently vacated job at his investment-analyst firm. But first he must win over his boss (Bruce Greenwood) by attending the company executives monthly dinner party to which each employee brings a gigantic moron. The guests dont know they are being judged for their ingrained stupidity. The guy who invites the biggest idiot wins - and for Tim winning means getting that promotion. In one of the films funniest scenes Tim finds his guest when he accidentally hits Barry (Steve Carell) with his car. Barry is a divorced IRS accountant whose hobby is creating elaborate dioramas from dead mice. He is also so far as common sense intelligence and intuition go more than a little lacking. I laughed uncontrollably when Barry tries to buy off Tim so he wont call the cops after the accident (the scene is a lot funnier than it sounds) and Carell and Rudd mesh so well that Dinner for Schmucks initially promises to be a riot. But then the movie goes off on a number of tangents such as a belabored detour involving Tims girlfriend Julie (Stephanie Szostak) who is curating the work of a ridiculously self-important artist (a game Jemaine Clement). The film spends an inordinate amount of time with bits of business such as Tims bad back that slow the pace with wan results. The sudden reappearance of Darla (Lucy Punch) an old one-night stand Tim regrets should have been uproarious - the woman is a relentless stalker and sexual dominatrix who simply wont take no for an answer - but most of her scenes seem forced and borderline misogynistic (I know this is a silly comedy but still). After almost 90 minutes Dinner for Schmucks finally gets to the awaited meal which doesnt exactly disappoint (theres an ingenious bit involving a blind fencer who fancies himself a champion) but it doesnt feel worth the wait either. Tims character is so wishy-washy and easy to manipulate he ends up irritating you despite Rudds considerable charm. Carell has few peers at playing dolts but Barry has nothing on The Offices Michael Scott a role that may end up sabotaging the actors career (hell probably never find a part that fits him so well). The most amusing thing about Zach (The Hangover) Galifianakis as Barrys bizarre boss is his strange sweater. The hands-down funniest elements in Dinner for Schmucks turn out to be the mice dioramas which become increasingly clever - even touching - as the film unfolds then laugh-out-loud hilarious over the end credits. But you know youre in trouble when the best thing in your movie is a bunch of dead rodents. Cast Steve Carell Paul Rudd Zach Galifianakis Jemaine Clement Stephanie Szostak Lucy Punch Bruce Greenwood.

Middle-ranking corporate investment exec Tim (Paul Rudd) is angling for a promotion but to seal the deal he has to run along with his blokey bosss invitation to a meal at his mansion to which every guest has to bring an out-and-out idiot. Lucky for Tim he almost runs over Barry (Steve Carrell) a humourless thick-skinned tax-office nobody and fan of small stuffed animals. The meal itself which comes late in the day feels like an afterthought with more attention paid to low-grade farcical larks involving Tims fiancee Julie (Stephanie Szostak) her self-possessed artist boss (Jemaine Clement) Tims ditzy blonde stalker (Lucy Punch) a potential Swiss investor (David Walliams) and Barrys cruel boss (Zach Galifianakis). Few gags hit the mark and the ultimate parade of idiots is a failure especially as someone mistook stupid for eccentric.

So it makes sense -- even in a summer of comedic disappointments -- to have ones popcorn hopes up. Alas its not to be. Directed by Jay Roach the movie has a slew of goofball moments that dont add up to a consistently hilarious outing. Instead ""Schmucks"" falls into a growing category of comedies compelled to be unpleasantly nasty then too-hastily nice. And you wont have to spend much time at the fictional firm of Fender Financial to know which folks the title really refers to. Hint Its not the eclectic group of oddsters rounded up for a dinner meant to humiliate. In fact theres little in this minor comedy that you wont see coming. Its too bad. The movie was inspired by French writer-director Francis Vebers more deftly handled farce ""The Dinner Game"" (1998) about a haughty intellectual who invites an ""idiot"" to a party for sport only to get quite the comeuppance. This version spins a morality tale about a fairly decent guy named Tim Conrad (Rudd) who gives into indecency as he tries to hoist himself up another rung of the corporate ladder by finding an ""extraordinary person"" to bring to a party. Fender is the sort of shark-infested workplace where being called ""chum"" is not a comfort. Bruce Greenwood is toothy and sleek as Lance Fender the lord of this corporate frat house. Also in sync with the bullying vibe are Caldwell (Ron Livingston) and Williams (Larry Wilmore) all too pleased to round up unusual suspects for a night of smug fun. Tim has ideas and ambitions. Ideas get him in the door. The ambitions lead him astray. Hes also got lovely girlfriend Julie (Stephanie Szostak) who has hopes of curating museum shows and has yet to accept Tims marriage proposal. A subplot deals with Julies artist the polymorphously adventurous Kieran Vollard (Jemaine Clement). His ridiculous paintings underline with exclamation points the ""self"" in self-portrait. The movie begins charmingly enough. It ends nearly as well. The Beatles lilting ""Fool on the Hill"" plays as staged scenes of stuffed mice go by each more delicately wrought than the one before. Barry Speck (Carell) has a peculiar hobby. He makes these dioramas. Lunacy it appears is in the details. Tim befriends Barry and invites him to a dinner where hell unknowingly compete for biggest loser honors. The karmic payback is swift. The comedy comes as Tim gets his just deserts long before the banquet. Barry upends his romantic and work life. Lucy Punch portrays a one-night stand invited into the mix. Carell and Rudd did a fine jig of the sweet and the crude when they co-starred in ""Virgin."" Their physical humor has its moments here. Barry likes to play possum. Rudds pantomime of back pain is Lucille Ball funny. And their chemistry isnt forced. But Jay Roach directs them for broad gags. A greater problem lies in the sense that writers David Guion and Michael Handelman couldnt decide what kind of dolt to make Barry. At times he appears a savant then a naif. Still other times hes boorishly clueless especially about matters sexual. They seem to struggle against making Barrys boneheadedness a product of some biological glitch or educational disaster. Instead hes dumb -- or accidently insightful -- whichever suits the next laugh. As is his habit burly bearded Zach Galifianakis (""The Hangover"") arrives to inject maximum absurdity into the proceedings. He plays Therman Barrys boss at the IRS who has his minion convinced that he can control his mind. Their final showdown makes for the movies grandest silliest delight.

Steve Carell and Paul Rudd in Dinner for Schmucks. Movie Review Dinner for Schmucks Stuffed but not satisfied Add to ... Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jul. 30 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 312PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Dinner for Schmucks Directed by Jay Roach Written by David Guion and Michael Handelman Starring Steve Carell and Paul Rudd Classification 14A A remake of a French farce Dinner for Schmucks is a meal more for gluttons than gourmets. With moments of fitful hilarity the pairing of Paul Rudd Steve Carell and a talented cast of secondary actors theres plenty here to keep summer comedy fans satiated if not entirely satisfied. Consistent with the writing style that dominates contemporary movie comedy this new comedy from Jay Roach ( Meet the Fockers Austin Powers) is a trade-off between moments of improvised comic inspiration (reportedly cut from 900000 feet of film) and perfunctory dramatic bridging. Far too often Roach and his writers (David Guion and Michael Handelman) settle for stretches of slapstick inanity that even Larry Curly and Moe might excise as needlessly lowbrow. The movies premise comes from the 1998 hit movie The Dinner Game by Francis Veber (screenwriter of La cage aux folles) in which a group of wealthy businessmen compete to see who can invite the biggest fool to dinner. Rudd (hes restricted here to his straight-man-in-a-business-suit mode) plays investment analyst Tim Conrad who longs to move up to the coveted seventh floor of his firm. His pretty art curator girlfriend Julie (Stephanie Szostak) keeps postponing their engagement and Tim decides a promotion might convince her. When a colleague is sacked Tim has an opportunity to impress his boss (Bruce Greenwood) but first he has to pass the distasteful dinner test which he recognizes is ""a bit messed up."" He has the good luck to run into Barry Speck literally when he knocks him down with his Porsche. When the victim promptly offers to pay for damages Tim knows hes found a keeper but he quickly regrets the encounter. In a short time Barry (Carell) has insinuated himself in Tims life threatening to ruin his career relationship and fashionable condo. Buck-teethed bespectacled with the Jerry Lewis bowl cut and vacant wide-eyed smile Carells character seems borderline mentally disabled or perhaps a parody of the stock-comic moron that political correctness was supposed to have buried. (Heres one residual element of the French original; the over-cultured Europeans love holy idiots like Jerry Lewis.) Barry has a job as an IRS agent though his behaviour makes it seem improbable he could be functionally employed at all. The more grating aspects of the character are alleviated by Carells flights of whimsy and nimble comic timing. Also Barry has been bestowed with a gift for creating historical dioramas out of dead mice. (The imaginative ""mouseterpieces"" were created by the same team responsible for the puppets in Team America World Police and are so endearingly detailed its hard to imagine anyone laughing at them.) In an inspired touch Barry finds a natural kinship with an actual artist played by Jemaine Clement ( Flight of the Conchords) a randy conceited self-portraitist who threatens to steal Julie away from Tim. Clements grandly narcissistic performance is just one example of how much comic talent Dinner for Schmucks is willing to throw at the screen. Other secondary stars include Zach Galifianakis ( The Hangover) who appears as Barrys sadistic boss and mistakenly believes he has hypnotic powers. Theres also Little Britains David Walliams as a kooky Swiss millionaire The Daily Shows Kristen Schaal as Tims ferociously ambitious secretary and Larry Wilmore as a giggling sadistic executive. The only real misfire is statuesque English comedienne Lucy Punch (who stars in the upcoming Woody Allen film You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger) as Tims psychotic old flame. You have to enjoy the generosity of seeing so many good performers punching home their few moments of screen time but Roach chokes us with excess. The culminating dinner introduces a new roster of delusional eccentrics ending in a spiral of mayhem that looks and feels more like chaos than comedy. To paraphrase the words of the hungry orphan protagonist from Dickenss Oliver Twist ""Please sir we want less.""

We wonder who wins. Starring Paul Rudd Steve Carell Zach Galifianakis Stephanie Szostak Jemaine Clement Director Jay Roach Release Opened Jul 30 2010  Editorial Review Make a date with a lovable loserBy Ann HornadayFriday July 30 2010""Dinner for Schmucks"" has already raised hackles in the Yiddish-speaking community for the breathtakingly offensive epithet in its title (and its not ""dinner""). But it turns out that this comedy of humiliation starring Paul Rudd and Steve Carell isnt nearly as off-putting as it might have been. Rudd plays Tim an ambitious young executive desperate to impress his art-dealer girlfriend (the fetching Stephanie Szostak) who is invited by his icy boss (Bruce Greenwood) to attend one of his regular ""dinners for idiots."" Each guest is supposed to bring the dumbest most pathetic idiot he can find; the most pitiful plus-one wins. (""No mimes; its a cliche"" one co-worker warns.) When Tim literally collides with Barry (Carell) the game is afoot. Buck-toothed and goggle-eyed Barry makes neurotically detailed tableaux with stuffed dead mice. When he meets the blandly affable Tim he becomes as creepily bromantically inclined as Jim Carrey in ""The Cable Guy."" But instead of going dark ""Dinner for Schmucks"" keeps it breezy with Barry embroiling Tim in a twisty-tangly series of ever-more-mortifying mishaps. The fallout includes a debilitated back a sundered romance a reunion with a sexually predatory stalker (played with burlesque brio by Lucy Punch) and an IRS audit. Thats all before dinner. Jay Roach has adapted Francis Vebers 1998 French farce ""Le Diner de Cons"" with the same tired close-up close-up medium-shot rhythm that characterizes his ""Meet the Parents"" movies. Theres no doubt that the raggedy narrative propels what is essentially one broad set piece toward another. But Rudd and Carell have just the charisma alertness and dexterity to make ""Dinner for Schmucks"" work. (Rudd is particularly winning especially when he battles that bad back.) And the movie benefits from piquant spice by way of scene-stealing supporting players including ""Flight of the Conchords "" Jemaine Clement as a fatuous artist and Zach Galifianakis as a telepathic IRS agent. In truth ""Dinner for Schmucks"" is misnamed since most of the movies antic slapstick energy derives from the eventful run-up to the main event. The climactic party itself often feels like an awkward unevenly paced come-down. Thats also when the cruel premise of the film threatens to curdle into mean-spirited toxicity. But cheery humanism prevails in ""Dinner for Schmucks"" as does the cast as they overcome undistinguished direction an unsavory premise and some painfully forced material involving computer mishaps mistaken identities and at least one petty crime. ""Dinner for Schmucks"" may be as broad as the proverbial groaning board but Rudd and Carell bring out its most toothsome delights. They transform an otherwise disposable meal into something worth savoring.Contains sequences of crude and sexual content partial nudity and profanity.

By Peter Rainer Film critic July 30 2010 Save for later Saved Steve Carell left and Paul Rudd are shown in a scene from the movie Dinner for Schmucks. Merie Weismiller Wallace/Paramount Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of In the ho-hum comedy ""Dinner for Schmucks"" the odd couple pairing of Steve Carell and Paul Rudd is supposed to be an instant laugh riot - a Laurel and Hardy matchup for our time.True they look funny together. Rudd is so blandly clean-cut that just about anybody playing opposite him would seem like an oddball. Just in case Carell has been outfitted with a mangy hairpiece and buckteeth and wears a windbreaker even indoors. But once we get over the visual contrast between these two theres very little else to fall back on.Rudds Tim is an ambitious low-level financial analyst at a cutthroat private-equity firm in Los Angeles. He lives beyond his means drives a Porsche and has a sweet girlfriend Julie (Stephanie Szostak) who loves him but isnt quite ready to settle down. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? When Tims boss Lance Fender (Bruce Greenwood) presents him with a chance to zoom up the corporate ladder he jumps at the opportunity. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? A new office and a bigger paycheck are Tims if he takes part in a cruel ritual put on by Lance for the delectation of his fellow fat cats. Each guest invited to Lances mansion for a dinner party must bring with them an ""idiot"" - the more clueless and hapless the better. The bearer of the biggest idiot wins the bosss favor.(Just for the record and because the title of this film has stirred up some controversy it should be pointed out that an idiot is not the same thing as a schmuck a derogatory Yiddish term for to be polite about it ""a jerk."" The point I suppose is that the fat cats here are the real schmucks and not the ""idiots."" End of language lesson.)Tims guest who accidentally enters his life when Tim almost runs him down with his car is Carells Barry Speck a tax man and amateur taxidermist whose hobby is dressing up dead mice in tiny outfits and arranging them in cute tableaux. (The only graceful note in the movie is the opening credits when we see some of Barrys miniaturist handiwork in progress.) Pretty soon Barry in all his bucktoothed innocence is making a muck of Tims job and marriage prospects.Director Jay Roach and his screenwriters have loosely adapted the so-so 1998 Francis Veber French comedy ""The Dinner Game."" Vebers comic conceit which stopped short of actually showing the dinner doesnt really cross the Atlantic intact. For one thing the notion of sadistic rich people lording it over middle-class morons isnt exactly a sidesplitter. (Interestingly no wealthy ""idiots"" are brought to the dinner.) Class-oriented comedy has never been a big staple of American movies.Perhaps in recognition of this fact the filmmakers play down the nastier aspects of their material. Instead of truly being a go-getter for example Tim is only interested in advancement in order to win the glowing heart of his girlfriend - who of course cares nothing for luxury. And Barry who is made an object of ridicule not only by the other characters in the movie but also by the filmmakers turns out to be a sweet-souled saint. Just in case we felt bad about laughing at him.The characters who come off best in ""Dinner for Schmucks"" are those dead mice.

In other words the perfect dinner guest.       Photo Jay Roachs ""Dinner for Schmucks"" is the first comedy satirizing that well known if deplorable American institution of businessmen inviting low-IQ individuals to parties where they are openly mocked. Just kidding -- this isnt really an American custom. But the idea has been borrowed in greatly dumbed-down form from ""The Dinner Game"" a far funnier 1998 French movie by the prolific Francis Veber whose works have long been adapted by Hollywood with results ranging from hilarious (""The Birdcage"") to painfully unfunny (""The Toy""). Thanks to some belly laughs supplied by the likes of Steve Carell Paul Rudd Jemaine Clement and Zach Galifianakis the overlong overproduced and decidedly misogynistic ""Dinner for Schmucks"" is somewhere in the middle of the pack even though it will likely strike even those unfamiliar with the original as vaguely foreign. Thats not for lack of trying. The protagonist of the scathingly funny original was a philandering publisher an enthusiastic longtime participant in the dinners. For American consumption our far more sympathetic hero Tim (Rudd) only reluctantly accepts an invite from his boss (Bruce Greenwood) to help secure a promotion -- hoping his girlfriend will finally accept his marriage proposals. Tim strikes pay dirt when he meets Barry (Carell) an IRS employee and amateur taxidermist who creates elaborate miniature dioramas featuring dead mice. Barry is so stupid -- he makes Carells dim-witted character on ""The Office"" look like a genius by comparison -- that he offers to pay when hes struck by Tims car. Barry shows up at Tims the night before the dinner and proceeds to wreck among other things Tims apartment and his relationship with the girlfriend. Also in the run-up to the dinner Barry creates chaos involving the girlfriends new client a self-important artist (Clement) who invites the new odd couple to join him in a threesome while hes dressed as a half-animal. At Tims business brunch with an eccentric Swiss billionaire (David Walliams[mda CQ ] Barry arrives with a woman whos been stalking Tim (Lucy Punch) and proceeds to pass her off as our heros girlfriend. Like most of the other women in the movie including Barrys grotesque ex-wife shes a cruel caricature. And the sexual talk is far raunchier than youd expect from a film rated PG-13. The only normal woman is lovely Stephanie Szostak as Tims girlfriend who appears infrequently. The 80-minute ""The Dinner Game"" adapted from Vebers stage play and pretty much confined to the main characters apartment did not depict the much-discussed idiots dinner. The lavishly budgeted remake half an hour longer devotes most of that extra time to an elaborate staging of the event complete with a climactic fire. Its suprisingly flat with the notable exceptions of Barrys presentation of his dead mice as historical characters -- and Barrys idiot face-off with his amateur mentalist boss (Galifianakis) who is being sponsored by Tims business rival (Ron Livingston). ""Dinner With Schmucks"" may actually be the funniest movie currently in the marketplace -- but thats pretty much by default. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Get the baby in 3D Read Next Get the baby in 3D Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 44665 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 21991 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops 16058 Cop in bikini tackles bad guy Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

They glance at the new boy with a practiced contempt -- as if theyd majored in sneering at Yale -- and exude the smugness of people belonging to a club whose membership list is now closed. Does Tim really want to join this piss-posh crowd? God yes. So he will participate in an activity that to them is good malicious fun to him an ugly hazing ritual. He will attend a dinner party hosted by his boss (Bruce Greenwood) and like the others bring some doofus who can be relied on to make a fool of himself. Biggest idiot/lamebrain/schmuck wins. A tangle of ambition and decency Tim is both excited by his chance to break into the big time and troubled by the entry dues he has to pay. His girlfriend Julie (Stephanie Szostak) disapproves of the dinner game to the point of threatening to leave him and spend time with randy performance artist Kieran (Jemaine Clement). That worries decent Tim; but ambitious Tim can hardly pass up the savory sordid chance because hes just run into -- nearly run over in fact -- the perfect schmuck Barry (Steve Carell) an amateur taxidermist who constructs elaborately sad dioramas of his life peopled by stuffed mice. The briefest exposure to Barry shows how his inanity has screwed up his life. The rest of Dinner for Schmucks will demonstrate how Barry can screw up Tims. (See TIMEs Summer Entertainment Preview 2010.) A very sit-throughable comedy Dinner for Schmucks is a remake of Francis Vebers 1998 French film Le Diner de Cons (The Dinner Game). Veber a kind of Gallic Neil Simon worked on the script of the original La Cage aux Folles -- later Americanized as The Birdcage with Robin Williams and Nathan Lane. Seven other Veber movies have been remade in Hollywood most of them blips on the resumes of their high-powered stars --Williams in The Toy and Fathers Day Tom Hanks in The Man with One Red Shoe -- and directors Billy Wilders final film Buddy Buddy. (Le Diner de Cons also inspired a Bollywood comedy the 2007 Bheja Fry.) Dinner for Schmucks is the best of the Veber retread lot and a little better than it should be. (See the 100 best movies of all time.) Le Diner de Cons (which translates gently as Dinner for Idiots) has the agenda of a morality play to reveal that the seemingly normal guy is the emotional moron whose failings the seeming moron will expose. Pierre (Thierry Lhermitte) is a successful publisher who cheats on his wife and is an eager participant in the dinner game. Hes everything his American doppelganger Tim fears becoming; hes the other guys at the executive meeting. Vebers idiot Francois (Jacques Villeret) -- a forlorn tax collector whose hobby is creating matchstick sculptures of the Eiffel Tower the Golden Gate Bridge etc. -- is less schmuck than schlemiel he has exactly the sweet-souled klutziness and knack for disaster to teach Pierre the lesson he deserves. With the diagrammatic help of a few supporting characters (Pierres girlfriend; Francoiss chum at the Ministry of Finance) Veber constructs the matchstick antihero kicks him to pieces and rehabilitates him. The whole things over in a brisk 80 minutes and without ever getting to the big dinner. An unlikable protagonist being both too simple and too bold an idea for a Hollywood comedy screenwriters David Guion and Michael Handelman make Tim more conflicted and Barry way weirder. The two characters might be occupying different movies; they make Schmucks an Ivesian symphony in cleverly clashing tones. Director Jay Roach of the Austin Powers and Meet the ... franchises gives Tims early scenes an understated precision with a rolling accelerating tempo and a pleasingly anxious performance by Rudd and for all the glowering from the equity execs a general absence of mugging reaction shots to cue the audiences rooting interest. Just as Roachs Meet the Parents delivered more than its one-line synopsis promised (ooh the guys surname is Focker) Dinner for Schmucks transcends the grossness of its title and trailers. This may not be the highest achievement of the directors art -- to exceed minimal expectations -- but its an honorable one and Roach makes the grade. Then Carell takes charge in Moe Howard haircut and young Jerry Lewis affect and the movie pirouettes -- also expertly -- into slapstick mode. Barry is so socially maladroit as to be criminally clueless; Francois from the Veber original would take one look at Barry and say ""Cet homme est un vrai con"" Carells function here is to get viewers instantly and constantly cringing in apprehension of how he will next humiliate Tim. The movie isnt so much schizophrenic as playing both sides of its coin -- acutely observed comedy and flat-out farce -- in hopes of attracting both the older and the younger demographic. Youre meant to endure whichever parts you dont like and savor the ones you do. (See pictures of cinemas best-loved costumes.) Even in its grueling sections (choose one) Dinner for Schmucks has ample diversions in some lovely supporting roles. Zach Galifianakis who has been in six features since The Hangover a year ago has mesmerizing fun with the one-note role of Barrys co-worker and wife stealer. Clement (Bret McKenzies slightly loopier bandmate in The Flight of the Conchords) gives Kieran a satyrs preening menace -- a delicious turn thats not far from Clements bogus fantasy-novel author Dr. Ronald Chevalier in Gentlemen Broncos. I also was mad for Lucy Punch as Tims ex-girlfriend a vengeful stalker with nymphomaniac tendencies and a naughty tongue. In her one long scene Punch who has a similar (though less amusing) role in Woody Allens new You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger displays a gift for physical comedy as high art. I kept hoping shed return to torture Tim and Barry and elevate the movies game. And the dinner game yes Dinner for Schmucks does finally get there so the pompous guys can get theirs. Its the familiar moral that crazy is better than normal because anarchy liberates from confining social norms -- and because without the crazies a comedy would have no one to trip over furniture or play with dead mice. But on the way to this predictable conclusion the movie offers plenty of smart entertainment. Youd be a schmuck to miss it. See pictures of Steve Carell. See TIMEs Pictures of the Week.

"Dinner for Schmucks more jerk less chicken | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesDinner for Schmucks more jerk less chickenYoure out of luck if you seek scathing satire in Dinner for Schmucks unlike the French film it is based upon. Director Jay Roach wants everyone to feel good about himself.Steve Carell and Paul Rudd wheres the schmuck?  (Merie Weismiller Photo)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. July 29 2010Dinner for Schmucks (out of 4)Starring Steve Carell Paul Rudd Bruce Greenwood Jemaine Clement Stephanie Szostak and Zach Galifianakis. Directed by Jay Roach. 110 minutes. At major theatres. 14AThere might actually be a schmuck or two in Dinner for Schmucks but its debatable. There are jerks clowns and idiots plus one conflicted doofus (Paul Rudd) and one sweet-natured fool (Steve Carell).But schmucks? Not if you go by the intended meaning of the term which is highly derogatory Yiddish slang for ""penis."" Its not used in polite company. Not that long ago it would have been banned as a movie title. Its reserved for guys who really are well schmucks.Article Continued BelowAnd thats the dilemma of this very soft comedy by Jay Roach (Austin Powers Meet the Parents). Having won the battle of the suits and censors to use a risky label like Dinner for Schmucks Roach declines to push his luck any further. Like a kindergarten teacher organizing a kids footrace he wants everyone to win and feel good about himself.In adapting Francis Vebers 1998 French farce Le Diner des cons (The Dinner Game) Roach and his writers David Guion and Michael Handelman have completely defanged it.Vebers film was a scathing satire of the brutal French class system venal intellectuals seeking sport on innocent fools hold a weekly dinner contest to see who can bring the biggest moron as a guest. The real winner of course is whoever first realizes that possessing a high IQ doesnt make you a good person.Veber had such strong material and a great cast he didnt need to actually show one of these demented dinners. He made his point in the preparations for the event. He wasnt afraid to be cruel as the best comedy frequently is.Roach makes the near-fatal mistake of having both Rudd and Carell play nice guys. Rudds financier character Tim who is supposed to be the villain of the piece as per the Gallic original is more put-upon than predatory. The only thing he has in common with his French predecessor is a bad back.Tim gets roped into participating in the ""schmucks"" dinner to please his demanding boss (Bruce Greenwood) who is not easily pleased and his artsy girlfriend (Stephanie Szostak) who is not the least bit impressed. Rudd is so much better when hes in control of a situation and actually displays some malice.Carells foolish Barry meanwhile is almost too cute for words. With his bowl haircut toothy grin and rumpled lavender jacket he looks as if he just rambled out of a Beatrix Potter story. Barry works as a taxman for the U.S. government but the hobby he pursues with far greater zeal is taxidermy he collects dead mice which he stuffs dresses and poses in elaborate romantic tableaus.These ""mousterpieces"" as Barry calls them become such a big part of Dinner for Schmucks it almost makes you wonder if Roach would really rather have made a childrens movie. The endless display of Barrys creations first glimpsed in the opening credits as The Beatles ""Fool on the Hill"" plays on the soundtrack (for a reported 1 million U.S. licensing fee) helps bloat the movie to an unconscionable two-hour running time. As with most modern comedy filmmakers Judd Apatow being another prime offender Roach seems never to have heard or understood the maxim that brevity is the soul of wit.Barrys mice arent the only weird artworks given far too much emphasis in the film. Jemaine Clement (TVs The Flight of the Conchords) once again plays a narcissistic artiste painting huge portraits of himself in various animal guises and poses. His shtick is funny the first time but quickly wears.Dinner for Schmucks makes for such enervating entertainment it even manages to sap the strength of Zach Galifianakis who plays a rival fool and Greenwood who has become the go-to guy to play corporate weasels. Greenwood is probably the closest thing to a schmuck the film has since hes to blame for the dinners but here hes curiously hard to hate.This being a literal American comedy rather than a droll French one we actually get to see one of these schmuck-free dinners which also fails to satisfy.The reliable Carell does provide a few chuckles. Hes the only one who is supposed to be cuddly and he has become a master of idiocy. He locates his Barry somewhere between his weatherman Brick of Anchorman who really is thick and his oafish Michael Scott of TVs The Office who is probably not as dumb as he seems. More eccentric than anything else Barry is like a chattier version of Mr. Bean or Monsieur Hulot a bumbler you root for in spite of everything.Carell is smart enough to know how to play stupid. He also has the cojones to push thing to extremes when given the chance -- two things that Roach appears to lack.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

It isnt merely that he looks like a demonic Walt Whitman or carries an ax handle or is graced with all the social skills one might accrue by living alone for 40 years in the backwoods of Tennessee. Its not even the layer of filth hes accumulated. Its the verdigris of myth. Old Man Bush is a killer people say a barbarian a God-knows-what. Watch a clip from the new film ""Get Low"" starring Robert Duvall. Courtesy Sony Pictures Classics. In the liturgy of American history and literature Felix--played by national monument Robert Duvall--is something of a convention the ostracized loner the demonized eccentric. So the idea that ""Get Low""--director Aaron Schneiders ambitiously atmospheric dramedy of the 30s South--is ""based on a true story"" is really beside the point. Its about myth creation--and sin and memory. Further Reading Speakeasy Robert Duvall Talks About His ""Get Low"" Beard Playwright Horton Foote Speakeasy Aaron Schneider on Directing Duvall Murray Spacek Felix comes to town because he wants someone to help him throw a ""living funeral party."" He wants to attend his own wake so he can hear what all those people hes been avoiding for 40 years have to say about him. Outlandish they say. Really? Tom and Huck attended their own funeral and ""The Adventures of Tom Sawyer"" is even older than Felix Bush. Felix simply wants to host his own goodbye maybe have a band and the reasons why are the reasons ""Get Low"" is essential viewing. That and the acting. Sometime around ""Lonesome Dove"" Mr. Duvall went into quasi-codger mode and he still serves up crusty cranky disarmingly frank and outright rude with a twinkle in his eye. But Felix even in his cootness represents a golden opportunity for an actor who too often now gets shoehorned into one-dimensional parts that only suggest (or exploit) what he brings to a movie as both actor and icon. In Felix Mr. Duvall has a character of few words and large feelings mostly the guilt and regret that have driven him out of society. None of it is very obscure. The movie opens with a flashback of a house engulfed in flames; a lone figure running from it; Felix awakening from a sweaty dream and staring at an antique picture of a bygone beauty pinned to a bare wall. His bedside lamp is still lit suggesting both hellfire and eternal love. Schneider tells us the whole story right there but Mr. Duvall whos probably looking at another Oscar nomination next year gives it a heart. ENLARGE Robert Duvall in Get Low. Sony Pictures Classics; The movies soul however arrives via another avenue entirely namely Bill Murray as struggling undertaker and probable ex-felon Frank Quinn. Frank seems dismayed that hes gone legit and still cant make a living--and in a business everyone needs. ""People are dying in bunches"" he says tossing aside the newspaper. ""Except here."" For Frank Felixs morbid plan is like a birthday cake with candles. He smells a score Told about the ball of untidy cash Felix has been displaying in his attempt to buy that funeral Frank gives a knowing response ""Ooooh"" he says. ""Hermit money. Thats good."" Where his underling Buddy (Lucas Black) is painfully honest and uninteresting Frank is inherently larcenous and a laugh a minute. Ill certainly be seeing ""Get Low."" Robert Duvall is a national treasure. --Stephen Landes Hes also the personification of a certain kind of virtue precisely because ordinary virtue is against his nature. After Felix goes on the radio to invite the public to his funeral--and announces a raffle for the posthumous possession of his 300-odd unspoiled acres--Frank is gleeful. But once the cash starts arriving in the mail we feel Franks near-physical pain at not being able to throw it in a bag and flee--as hes likely done once or twice before. Franks sense of morality isnt born of geography or community or religion. His is an existential struggle in a place where uttering ""existential"" might have gotten you arrested. And Mr. Murray as usual has better timing than a getaway car. Like the music that percolates through ""Get Low""--the rollicking nouveau-bluegrass of Dobro virtuoso Jerry Douglas which is used at points to amp up a sluggish pace--""Get Low"" has a dichotomous nature personified by Mr. Duvall and Mr. Murray. Back around the time Mr. Duvall was starring in ""Network"" (1976) Mr. Murray was debuting on ""Saturday Night Live."" It would be tempting to concude that their artistic trajectories have finally intersected but its not quite true. ""Get Low"" (as in under the earth) never really wants to be the total period piece and thanks to Mr. Murray it always has one foot on modernist/absurdist turf. Hes not alone in being an anachronism. Felixs onetime love Mattie Darrow played by a wonderful Sissy Spacek isnt your usual 1938 movie woman. Shes self-possessed assured and theres a sauciness about her too--much like Chris Provenzano and C. Gaby Mitchells script. ""He was beautiful"" Mattie says of the younger Felix and you can hear all the bygone longing rippling like a brook in a Tennessee wood. Watch a clip from the film ""Life During Wartime"" from filmmaker Todd Solondz. Courtesy IFC Films. Life During Wartime In Woody Allens ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" the insufferable TV producer played by Alan Alda declares ad nauseam that comedy ""is tragedy plus time."" Tragedy plus time. Its certainly an idea with merit but one thoroughly subverted by director Todd Solondz and ""Life During Wartime."" A sort-of-sequel to 1998s scandalous ""Happiness"" and Mr. Solondzs first feature in six years ""LDW"" derives its blackly comedic bite from being both tragic and immediate. What is said by its cast of anguished angry clueless and fearful characters is often so fleetingly casually appalling that laughter becomes almost reflexive. What does take a bit of time to arrive is the realization of how brutally honest so much of it is. ENLARGE Dylan Riley Snyder and Allison Janney in Life During Wartime. IFC The theme of ""Life During Wartime"" is forgiveness and Mr. Solondz stealth provocateur sets up characters who deliberately test the limits of tolerance and charity. The gravest of these is Bill (Ciaran Hinds) a convicted pedophile who is being released from prison and traveling toward his former home in search of his older son Billy (Chris Marquette). He experiences troubling dreams along the way and a tryst with a woman named Jacqueline (a brilliant harrowing Charlotte Rampling) who engages him in a Pinteresque war of wits and frighteningly needy night in bed. Bills embittered wife Trish (Allison Janney) meanwhile has met an unlikely new man Harvey (Michael Lerner) and fallen absurdly in love. Her sister Joy (the terrific Scottish actress Shirley Henderson) has left her husband Allen (Michael Kenneth Williams) because of his problematic sexual proclivities and is visited in her dreams by a dead boyfriend (Paul Reubens) who still wants her back. Their other sister Helen (Ally Sheedy) is an Emmy-winning TV writer ""feeling crushed by the enormity of my success"" who is dating someone named ""Keanu."" Helen is the only one whos flat-out funny. Others require more consideration. When the love-besotted Trish explains her new feelings to her younger son Timmy (Dylan Riley Snyder) its the height of indiscretion. But Trish is representative of all Mr. Solondzs characters. They want forgiveness and yet are blithely blind to their real flaws; they cant forgive because they cant see far over the walls theyve built around themselves. The common problem of Solondzs characters is an inability to see the world in shades of grey which is fitting in a film where color--garish boring or just plain ugly--is so important and the actors are working off palettes of such extreme emotions. A few of them--notably Ms. Rampling Mr. Hinds and Ms. Sheedy--are as good here as theyve ever been. ENLARGE Marian Seldes and Paul Dano in The Extra Man. Magnolia Pictures The Extra Man Kevin Kline is a beloved actor who has made some odd choices (""De-Lovely"" ""Life As a House""). But hes never had a movie stolen right out from under him which is exactly what happens in ""The Extra Man."" The perpetrator is Paul Dano who plays fledgling writer Louis Ives in this adaptation of a Jonathan Ames novel. Ives rents a room from Mr. Klines down-at-the-heel socialite Henry Harrison whose main occupation is escorting various wealthy and elderly women to dinner and the opera. Its a new and alarming world that Henry opens for Louis who is painfully naive unschooled in life and has to cope with a few demons of his own. Mr. Kline is his usual engaging self but its a supporting role hes playing by virtue of the script but also Mr. Danos presence in this potent charmer of a film. Directors Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini show the same appreciation for eccentrics and humanity they brought to ""American Splendor"" and Mr. Danos Louis is a delicately wrought wonder. Watch a clip from ""Dinner for Schmucks"" a new film starring Steve Carell and Paul Rudd. Courtesy Paramount Pictures. Dinner for Schmucks The centerpiece of this Jay (""Meet The Parents"") Roach comedy starring Steve Carell and Paul Rudd is an elaborate event at which attendees are amused by idiots--not unlike the experience of ""Dinner for Schmucks."" Pathetically unfunny most of the time its also a case of studio bait-and-switch Despite what the ads suggest at least an hour goes by before the movie gets to the actual dinner which is clever enough in the make-fun-of-morons fashion currently in vogue. But most of the film is devoted to the misshapen ""friendship"" of Tim (Mr. Rudd) an ambitious financial analyst and Barry (Mr. Carell) a mouse-taxidermist and all-around geek whom Tim invites along to curry favor with his boss Larry (Bruce Greenwood). The point of the movie is how miserable Tims life is made by Barry and audiences will know exactly how he feels. --John Anderson contributes film criticism and coverage to a variety of publications. Joe Morgenstern returns next week. DVD FOCUS ENLARGE The Conversation (1974) Robert Duvall gave an uncredited performance as The Director the mysterious figure who commissions surveillance specialist Harry Caul (Gene Hackman) to record his wife and her lover (Cindy William and Frederic Forrest) in Francis Ford Copollas masterpiece of intrigue and paranoia. Made by Mr. Coppola between the first two ""Godfather"" films ""The Conversation"" wound up a Best Picture nominee in competition with ""Godfather II"". When the 70s are cited as a golden age of American cinema ""The Conversation"" is Exhibit A. ENLARGE Tootsie (1982) Bill Murray gave an uncredited performance as Jeff Slater roommate of Michael Dorsey (Dustin Hoffman) and one of the few characters in Sydney Pollacks classic gender-bending comedy who knows that Michael is masquerading as Dorothy Michaels overnight soap star. ""That is one nutty hospital"" Jeff says as he watches matters fly completely out of control on ""Southwest General"" the show in question. The show also stars Julie Nichols (Jessica Lange) Ron Carlisle (Dabney Coleman) and John Van Horn (George Gaynes). ENLARGE Andy Warhols Trash (1970) Sissy Spacek gave an uncredited performance as ""Girl at the bar"" in this 60s counterculture landmark written and directed by Paul Morrissey (as were many of the so-called ""Warhol"" features such as ""Dracula"" and ""Frankenstein""). Starring Warhol regulars Joe Dallesandro and Holly Woodlawn it followed a heroin addict named Joe (Mr. Dallesandro) as he tries to score drugs while also dealing with his dissatisfied girlfriend played by female impersonator Ms. Woodlawn. Legendary Hollywood director George Cukor was so impressed by Ms. Woodlawn that he tried to get her nominated for an Academy Award. --John Anderson Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Most Popular Articles Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Donald Trump Lashes Out at Michael Bloomberg GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Though it bears no resemblance to John Steinbecks classic gussied-up rodents and inane male antics come together in funny and inspired ways in this screwball farce. Based on the 1998 French comedy The Dinner Game Schmucks is one of the rare remakes that improve upon the foreign-made original. Francis Vebers version was a more mean-spirited affair with humor that bore a strong Gallic inflection. Director Jay Roach (Meet the Parents) has cleverly reimagined the idea for an American comic sensibility softening the edges without removing the essential bite. TRAILER Your invitation to Dinner for Schmucks PHOTO GALLERY The many faces of Steve Carell Where the French leads were nasty Steve Carell and Paul Rudd have an inherently likable quality even when playing a foolish sap and a cutthroat businessman. Carell and Rudd are both at the top of their comic game here with an odd-couple chemistry. The concept is simple -- and undeniably cruel Smug moneyed executives hold a monthly dinner to which each brings a megafool to dinner telling him hes an honored guest. The one who brings the biggest idiot wins. But as reimagined by Roach the executive has a conscience and the dumbbell is a loopy innocent with a big heart. Tim (Rudd) is an ambitious financial analyst who gets roped into the aforementioned dinner by his boss (Bruce Greenwood) who insists he attend as he dangles a promotion. Tims art curator girlfriend Julie (Stephanie Szostak) is appalled by the idea and Tims decency makes him initially resist attending. But an unexpected encounter with Barry (Carell) as he retrieves a dead mouse from a busy street provides Tim with his ideal dinner companion. Rudd is a deft straight man with subtly humorous moves and deadpan reactions. Carell strikes comic gold as a bucktoothed taxman always clad in a windbreaker and sporting a bad toupee of indescribable hue. Hes unpredictable and strange popping off with bizarrely funny comments at inopportune moments. Barry slathers himself in bad aftershave to cover up the stench of formaldehyde that dogs him as a result of his hobby fashioning intricate mouse dioramas. Though he works at the IRS his mouse passion defines him. These ridiculously detailed mouse tableaux are the movies funniest running gags and the ""Tower of Dreams"" Barry demonstrates at the dinner party elicits some of the biggest laughs. Jemaine Clement (Flight of the Conchords) nearly steals the movie as a pretentious artist who works with Julie. His off-the-wall remarks bizarre costumes and animalistic tendencies are absurdly comical. Dinner for Schmucks is more weirdly silly than hugely funny. There are no hilarious bursts of humor. Instead it offers consistent if occasionally cringe-worthy amusement. Whether focusing on men mice or mousy men its one of the summers most enjoyable comedies.

"Dinner for Schmucks movie review Carell strains for laughs |       NJ.com comments Dinner for Schmucks movie review Carell strains for laughs Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on July 30 2010 at 805 AM View/Post Comments Paramount Pictures/DreamWorks Pictures/Spyglass Entertainment. (MCT) You can tell Steve Carell plays a schmuck in ""Dinner for Schmucks"" because he has glasses and a bad haircut. Paul Rudd Not a schmuck. Tim is a bright-eyed and eager financial analyst who really should be 10 years past having to be bright-eyed and eager. But finally -- finally -- that promotion to mergers-and-acquisitions is in sight. Theres just one catch. His boss wants him to come to his regular ""dinner for losers"" where each guest brings an unsuspecting moron to ridicule. So heres the question Can Tim really hurt another human being just for personal profit? Hey he wants to be in mergers-and-acquisitions remember? This is the set-up for the crudely titled ""Dinner for Schmucks"" an adaptation of a French film from the one-man farce factory Francis Veber (among his hits the original nonmusical ""La Cage Aux Folles""). But it loses something in the translation. Part of that is in the adaptation by David Guion and Michael Handelman which introduces the moron -- Barry an annoying IRS man and amateur taxidermist -- and then keeps him hanging on so that he wears out his welcome long before the climactic dinner. Most of the problem is in the performance of Steve Carell. Carell can be very funny but hes been asked to be too funny too often recently. A run of ""The Office"" a voiceover for ""Despicable Me"" the comic ""Date Night"" -- all have already come out this year and by the time of this film he seems stretched thin. At the same time though he has a director -- Jay Roach whose fondness for vulgar titles took him through all the Austin Powers movies and both ""Fockers"" films -- whose only apparent instruction to his actors is ""Again -- but bigger"" So Carell goes real big here. His mouth is split in a constant toothy grin. His eyes are perpetually wide. His hair sticks up like a haystack. He is the kind of comic caricature that even circa-1963 Jerry Lewis would wave away with ""Nah too schticky."" Movie Review Dinner for Schmucks (PG-13) Paramount (114 min.) Directed by Jay Roach. With Paul Rudd Steve Carell. Now playing in New Jersey. Ratings note The film contains sexual situations strong language and comic violence. Stephen Whittys review TWO AND A HALF STARS But in this film too much is never enough. Paul Rudd American comedys constant unheralded MVP helps a great deal by underplaying as Tim rooting things firmly in reality (so firmly alas that you quickly dislike Carells Barry even more). And there are great guest turns by Jermaine Clement as a pompous artist (although its a bit close to his pompous writer in ""Gentlemen Broncos"") Lucy Punch as a voracious vixen and Zach Galifianakis as a Kreskin-worshipping taxman. They however are only in the film for several scenes. Carell is in the whole movie and his determination to be bigger better and funnier only ironically results in deflating his own performance. Hes like the guitar hero who puts everything he has into that first solo and then has nothing left for the rest of the gig. There are a couple of good laughs. And the sight of Ron Livingston lurking about the executive cubicles brings back fond memories of ""Office Space"" an ahead-of-its-time strike at 9-to-5 wage slavery. Rent this film in a few months and you may have a decent time. But pay 12 to see it now? You might just be nominating yourself for a place at that dinner.

A human hand can be seen in several of the shots delicately applying paint or fixing an article of clothing on the cute but decidedly dead rodents.Whoever that hand belongs to has got to be weird.And indeed as we soon learn he is. Barry - played by Steve Carell with a nerdy overbite and well a mousy mien - is an IRS employee who builds elaborate miniature scenes in his spare time. And since he lives alone and has few friends theres lots of time to spare.And then one fateful day Barry bumps into Tim (Paul Rudd) - or more accurately Tim runs into Barry with his Porsche. A mid-level finance exec with designs on a bigger paycheck and a corner office Tim has just been invited to a dinner party hosted by his boss. Its a dinner with a theme each guest must bring along someone mockable - a fool a jerk a deluded twit. The guest with the biggest buffoon wins.Et voilA  Barry - like a gift from the gods.Adapted from Francis Vebers 1998 French farce The Dinner Game the sometimes very funny sometimes not Dinner for Schmucks takes this squirmy conceit - the original was a more sour and cynical affair - and turns it into a mismatched buddies life-lesson comedy.Jay Roach (the Austin Powers movies Meet the Parents Meet the Fokkers) has cast his picture with standout comic talents Jemaine Clement as a preening modern-day Dionysian art world star; Zach Galifianakis as Barrys IRS superior and a man who believes he has psychic powers; Lucy Punch as Tims stalker ex; and Kristen Schaal as Tims blunt bossy secretary.As it turns out most of Dinner for Schmucks transpires in the time leading up to the actual soiree as Barry both terribly naive and a terrible pest worms his way into Tims life. Rudd of course is the straight man in all this his Tim is smart and likable up to a point but with the potential to turn into soulless yuppie scum.His girlfriend Julie (Stephanie Szostak) a gallerist with a soft Gallic accent senses this and is rightly offended by the idea behind the dinner. Watching Rudds Tim try to rationalize his way around the moral dilemmas that the invitation presents produces some of the films most charged comedic scenes. And Barrys blundering efforts to help Tim patch things up with Julie leads to entertainingly excruciating mistaken-identity silliness. Enter the tall and terrifying Ms. Punch.Dinner for Schmucks suffers in sections where the improv-y riffing calls attention to itself. And the dinner alas is anticlimactic. Roach and his writers opt for a cinematic variation of Raymond Chandlers famous counsel ""When in doubt have a man come through the door with a gun in his hand."" Instead of a gun however its a guest who starts a fire.Dinner for Schmucks goes up in flames. Amusingly perhaps - but creatively too.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com. Read his blog ""On Movies Online"" at www.philly.com/philly/blogs/onmovies.

Starring Paul Rudd and Steve Carell. Directed by Jay Roach. (PG-13. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Dinner for Schmucks"" is lumbering inconsistent and about 20 minutes too long but its funny. Its funny from the beginning and it stays funny even as it beats scenes to death and overstays its welcome. Funny in a comedy is like a loving nature in a parent Without it theres nothing. With it much can be forgiven. So to see ""Dinner for Schmucks"" is to forgive it then enjoy it. The film is a remake or rather a re-conception of an elegant French comedy released 11 years ago and known here as ""The Dinner Game."" That film told the story of a spiteful big shot who has an ongoing contest with friends to bring idiots to a dinner party. Whoever brings the biggest idiot wins. The French film was tightly structured and extremely funny - much funnier than ""Dinner for Schmucks"" - but there was one thing about it that was a little frustrating The promised dinner never took place onscreen. ""Dinner for Schmucks"" tries to correct that omission. It also makes additions and softens edges which in some cases alters the delicate balance upon which the comedy rests. Paul Rudd as Tim is not an arrogant big shot at all here just a nice guy gunning for a promotion. He gets a chance to join the companys inner circle when the boss (Bruce Greenwood) invites him to bring an idiot to their upcoming dinner game ... And so he finds Barry (Steve Carell) a complete idiot whose hobby is stuffing dead mice and arranging them into domestic tableaux. Carell is perfectly in his element as a sweet-natured well-meaning guy who becomes a tornado of destruction in Tims life and the script comes up with clever ways for him to cause this trouble without meaning to. But theres a problem not a huge or fatal one but something that tempers the intensity of the comedy throughout Because Tim is not powerful not rich and not a terrible person and because hes played by Paul Rudd who is about as likable as a beagle puppy the spectacle of seeing his property destroyed and his relationships damaged is not one we witness with abandoned glee. We laugh. We enjoy it but without the sadistic giddiness that might have put this one over the top. The scale of the movie allows for the filmmakers to try things. The introduction of an artist character (""Flight of the Conchords "" Jemaine Clement) who fancies himself a satyr and depicts himself in all his paintings becomes an ongoing source of fun. The women are good too - Stephanie Szostak in the straight role of Tims girlfriend and Lucy Punch (""Being Julia"") quite funny in a nightmarish way as a woman whos stalking him. However a running gag involving Zach Galifianakis as an IRS agent practicing mind control sucks up about 15 minutes of screen time and should have been left on the cutting-room floor. In true American style ""Dinner for Schmucks"" ultimately strives for a pathos it doesnt achieve - except surprisingly enough in those mouse tableaux. Theyre meticulously done rather sweet and look more like respectable folk art than the work of a true idiot. -- Advisory This film contains sexual situations.

The movie is a satire of Euro snobbery; leave it to the French to turn condescension into a bourgeois parlor game. Movie Information Dinner for SchmucksRatingShowtimes | Official site and trailerDirector Jay RoachStarring Steve Carell Paul Rudd Stephanie Szostak and Zach GalifianakisRun time 110 minutesMPAA rating PG-13 (sequences of crude and sexual content partial nudity language)Synopsis A remake of The Dinner Game with Paul Rudd as an executive and Steve Carell as the schmuck.More movies from GuideLive.comBut why would anyone think this premise might translate to America a country whose citizens are perfectly in touch with their inner slobs? Dinner for Schmucks is more than just sour and mean-spirited; its lurching desperate and borderline incomprehensible - a movie whose characters act according to no known precept of recognizable human behavior.Paul Rudd stars as Tim an ambitious stock analyst angling for a promotion. Tims boss (Bruce Greenwood) invites him to join the companys regular ""dinner for idiots"" in which the participants are each asked to bring someone whom the rest of the group can silently mock.As corporate retreats go this sounds like a whole lot of effort for little reward and Tims first inclination is to skip the dinner. But when he literally crashes into a strange IRS agent named Barry (Steve Carell) whose primary hobby involves making elaborate dioramas featuring stuffed mice Tim thinks its a sign from God.Or some such nonsense because before we can arrive at the titular event Dinner for Schmucks forces us to endure a series of increasingly contrived and inexplicable sequences as Barry latches onto Tim and wreaks havoc on his life.On and on it goes as the plot keeps drifting off in more inane directions. The movie presumably should be about Tims comeuppance He learns that the people he might regard as fools really have a great deal of wisdom to offer. But Rudd is much too sweet-natured a presence. You never buy for a moment that hed be willing to subject anyone to the humiliation of a ""dinner for idiots.""More to the point Barrys behavior is so weirdly passive-aggressive and sadistic that you start to fear for Tims physical safety. The movie would be over much sooner and would be more dramatically satisfying if Tim just called the police and demanded a restraining order.Wearing round-framed glasses a too-short-for-his-head haircut and tripping over every prop in sight Carell seems to be trying to invoke the spirit of Jerry Lewis in The Nutty Professor which makes sense considering the French provenance of the material. Its far and away the worst performance of Carells career (Evan Almighty all is forgiven) but then again no actor alive could have salvaged the ghastly screenplay by David Guion and Michael Handelman.As it turns out the only interesting things here are Barrys mouse dioramas a series of lovingly rendered obsessively detailed riffs on historical events (a mouse re-creation of the Wright Brothers first flight); paintings (a mouse Mona Lisa); and so forth. (They were made by brothers Stephen Edward and Charles Chiodo.) Yet even these charming art objects make no real sense in the context of the movie; were supposed to think people would regard Barry as a ""schmuck"" for creating them when its more likely theyd be offering him a gallery show and tens of thousands of dollars. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

"Movie review Dinner for Schmucks - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review Dinner for SchmucksNot even Steve Carell and Paul Rudd can save this story of misunderstanding and humiliation from being distinctly unfunny.July 30 2010|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic What do you get when you combine a swell French comedy concept a top American comedy director and two of the best comedy actors around? Against all reason and expectation the result is a distinctly unfunny film. That would be ""Dinner for Schmucks"" starring Steve Carell and Paul Rudd and directed by Jay Roach. The films noticeable lack of laughs is as baffling as its choice of a once-taboo Yiddish word for its title. Certainly Carell and Rudd whove worked together in ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" and ""Anchorman The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" are actors who know their way around humor. As does director Roach who has the ""Austin Powers"" films as well as the beautifully done ""Meet the Parents"" on his rA(c)sumA(c). And there is certainly nothing wrong with the concept for the film especially as formerly executed by the excellent French writer-director Francis Veber who won a Cesar (as did two of his actors) for his 1998 ""Le DA(r)ner de Cons"" translated as ""The Dinner Game."" The only French film to rival ""Titanic"" at the Gallic box office ""The Dinner Game"" starts with the concept of supper parties in which heartless co-conspirators are charged with bringing complete fools to the table so that everyone else can laugh at them behind their backs. Its a classic French verbal farce in which inch by imperceptible inch things get beautifully and hysterically out of control. Officially only ""inspired by"" the French film which started life as stage play ""Schmucks"" understandably expands on the original and in some ways exceeds it. While the French idiot built a scale-model Eiffel Tower completely out of matchsticks this films Barry Speck (Carell) uses tiny dead mice dressed as humans to create elaborate dioramas from art and history. As designed by Joel Venti and actually created by Charles Edward and Stephen Chiodo these ""mouseterpieces"" have an ability to make you smile that is largely absent from the rest of the movie. Any film (""Ratatouille"" excepted) in which the mice are more appealing than the human protagonists is in more than a bit of trouble. That trouble is not in evidence at first as the script by the team of David Guion amp; Michael Handelman sets the scene of the crime by introducing us to ambitious young Tim Conrad (Rudd). Eager for promotion at the private equity firm of Fender Financial he catches the eye of boss Lance Fender ( Bruce Greenwood) who invites him to a weekend soirA(c)e where not to put too fine a point on it ""you invite idiots to dinner to make fun of them."" Unhappy at this notion is Tims beautiful gallery-owning girlfriend Julie (Stephanie Szostak) who has dilemmas of her own dealing with her star artist the hairy and very primal Kieran Vollard ( Jemaine Clement of HBOs ""The Flight of the Conchords""). Aside from those mice the best thing about ""Schmucks"" is the skill and care with which Roach and his casting team have peopled the films supporting parts. Aside from Greenwood Szostak and Clement those smartly cast folks include Kristen Schaal as Tims secretary David Walliams as a Swiss billionaire and Zach Galifianakis and Christopher ODowd as fellow dinner guests. But just when ""Dinner for Schmucks"" should be kicking into gear just when it should start making you really laugh because Carell enters the picture thats the point at which the whole enterprise starts to fall apart. Carell is of course one of the funniest people working today but his Barry Speck character seems misconceived. Yes as a man with no insight no self-awareness no irony and no sense of humor Barry is no bright light but the problem is that instead of being comedic he comes off as a genuinely crazed and dangerous individual. And once Tim involves Barry in his life by inviting him to the idiots dinner things get worse in more ways than one. The situations that Barry precipitates a alienating Julie encouraging a stalker getting Tim in trouble with the IRS and jeopardizing his job a are too hostile and humiliating to be funny. A pest on a colossal scale ""a tornado of destruction"" in Tims words Barry is the least amusing nominally comic character in memory. Making things worse is ""Dinner for Schmucks "" determination to add both sentimentality and raunchy dialogue to the mix. Writing about the possibility of a ""Dinner Game"" remake more than 10 years ago I worried that ""its doubtful that anyone anywhere can do this story better justice than is done right here.""

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Observation No. 1 Previews kill comedy. ""Dinner for Schmucks the new movie from Jay Roach (""Austin Powers ""Meet the Parents) is far from a classic of precision farce but its funnier than the trailers make it seem. The ads highlight the dopiest crassest gags; theyre there all right but as part of a nonstop flow of silliness that doesnt build so much as continually renew itself. A number of bits dont work some of the characters wear out their welcome but the whole suckers you into an agreeable state of idiot bliss. I felt a little unclean afterward but thats my problem.Observation No. 2 Steve Carell doesnt need glasses and funny teeth. Carell plays the schmuck of ""Schmucks a cheerily moronic walking disaster named Barry who is befriended by Tim (Paul Rudd) a rising businessman seeking to get ahead with his boss (Bruce Greenwood). As in the 1998 French film ""The Dinner Game on which the new movies based the boss holds parties where each employee brings a twit; the best twit wins a prize without knowing hes actually the evenings biggest joke. The movie pretends to be appalled at the cruelty of this notion but its heart isnt in it; these days mocking the afflicted and the affected is an established source of profits for Hollywood in general and Roach in particular.Barry is Tims chosen twit and within hours of their meeting he has reduced his new friends life to itty-bitty pieces of rubble. He mistakes Tims levelheaded art-curator girlfriend (Stephanie Szostak astonishingly graceful under the circumstances) for his deranged ex-girlfriend (Lucy Punch) trashes Tims apartment throws out Tims back -- things like that. At times it feels like a Neil Simon play cast by Judd Apatow.The movies full of raving lunatics with best-in-show honors shared by Zach Galifianakis (the big baby of ""The Hangover) as Barrys monomaniacal rival in love and mind-control and Jemaine Clement as an avant-prat of an artist a Russell Brand-style role that the ""Flight of the Conchords star makes giddily his own. The misfits who turn up at the climactic title dinner on the other hand are one-dimensional freaks and not funny in the least.In this company Carell gets his laughs but seems rather lost and its not hard to figure out why Barrys a character part that saddles the star with a clownish makeover -- spectacles a blond bowl cut and so on. Carells great strength as a comedian is the gap between his physical normality and the wonderfully stupid things that tumble out whenever Michael Scott of ""The Office or Brick Tamland of ""Anchorman opens his mouth. (By contrast Carells great strength as an actor in films like ""Little Miss Sunshine and even ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin is his put-upon sanity.)Barrys just a nincompoop from the get-go though and while there are decent gags involving his hobbies (making dioramas with stuffed mice) and observations (misquoting John Lennons ""Imagine ""You may say that Im a dreamer but Im not) theres no tension to the part and far too much sentimentality. Carells too smart a performer to have to roll over for our sympathies.Observation No. 3 Paul Rudd is ready to go solo. The truth is Rudds the funniest person in ""Dinner for Schmucks. Tims long patient slow burn as he contemplates his life laid to waste becomes the punch line to each scene and in the movies low-farce highlight -- a business brunch featuring Tim Barry a fatuous Swiss executive (David Walliams) his hotsy-totsy wife (Lucy Davenport) the real girlfriend and the ex -- we laugh less at Barrys endless screw-ups than at Tims frantic efforts to roll with them. Enough of pairing Rudd with other messier comic actors in movies like ""Role Models and ""I Love You Man. In the happy debased landscape of post-Apatow comedy culture Rudds practically Cary Grant. He deserves a movie of his own.(Speaking of debasement by the way heres Consumer Advisory Observation No. 4 ""Dinner for Schmucks is PG-13 but take the younger kids at your own risk. Unless like the woman sitting behind me at the screening you really want to be asked to define a particular lady part -- the one that rhymes with ""Dolores -- by your 7-year-old daughter. That must have been some car ride home.)Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. Follow him at www.twitter.com/tyburr. (c) Copyright 2010 Globe Newspaper Company. Thought you might like ...

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Francis Vebers 1998 French black comedy The Dinner Game is relentlessly mean-spirited heaping one karmic payback after another on a callous philandering businessman who hopes to exploit a well-meaning dolt for his own personal gain. Jay Roachs American adaptation Dinner For Schmucks softens things considerably siccing an earnest but destructive idiot (Steve Carell) upon a well-meaning go-getter (Paul Rudd) whose only crime is making a couple of bad judgment calls. Thanks to Rudd and Carells dependable likeability and a tacked-on warm-and-fuzzy ending Dinner For Schmucks is leagues ahead of its forebear in terms of mass appeal but its laughs are more silly than scathing. The unraveling of Rudds charmed life begins when in order to land a big promotion he agrees to attend a dinner party where his smarmy boss (Bruce Greenwood) and his sycophants compete over who can bring along the most hilariously idiotic plus-one. After his perfect-in-every-way girlfriend (Stephanie Szostak) voices her displeasure at the cruel game Rudd agrees to back out but when he literally runs into Carell and discovers his hobby of creating intricate dioramas featuring taxidermied mice he cant help but renege on his promise. Within hours Carells aggressive stupidity wreaks havoc on Rudds relationship home and body with every attempt to repair the damage exacerbating it further. Unlike the original in which the titular party never happens Schmucks culminates in an absurd dinner highlighted by the appearance of Zach Galifianakis as Carells delusional foe. The dinners flailing noisy antics are a good representation of the films comedic M.O. over-the-top silliness that on more than one occasion devolves into characters just making funny noises and pulling faces. Carell is more adept than most at making awkward man-child antics endearing but it often becomes exhausting particularly when combined with Lucy Punchs screeching psychotic performance as Rudds violence-prone stalker. Jemaine Clement provides some relief as a self-absorbed photographer and Rudds romantic competition; the character is more than a little reminiscent of Russell Brands character in Forgetting Sarah Marshall but Clements deadpan obliviousness is a nice counterpoint to Carells over-the-top stupidity. Gags are deployed at such a rapid pace and high volume that its easy to get caught up in the films manic energy though with a couple of exceptions--such as the repeated sight gag of Carells mice dioramas--none of the jokes stick after their initial impact. Instead they dissolve into a vague notion of humor without any sharp edges.

"Dinner For Schmucks A comedy for idiots about idiots. Slate Sign In Sign Up Dinner For Schmucks A comedy for idiots about idiots. Dinner For Schmucks A comedy for idiots about idiots. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.July 29 2010 1004 AM Dinner for Schmucks A comedy for idiots about idiots. By Tom Shone Also in Slate read Elbert Venturas appreciation of Paul Rudd. Amid all the septic-tank gags Meet the Parents had one standout scene--at De Niros dinner table where a nervous Ben Stiller delivers an excruciating soliloquy about cat-milking. Its one of the age-old tenets of farce--goofy stuff said at the dinner table sounds twice as goofy--but director Jay Roach was obviously so enamored of his discovery that he has sought to turn it into an entire movie. In Dinner for Schmucks (Paramount) a group of L.A. financiers meet regularly for dinner each bringing along an idiot for everyones amusement. The one with the best idiot wins. The idea is lifted from the 1998 French film Le Diner des Cons directed by Francis Veber in which a snobbish publisher befriended a fool for the purposes of civilized mockery only to see the fool visit chaos upon every corner of his life. It wasnt Feydeau but it delivered a neat kick to the shins of Parisian literary snobs--boo hiss. Im not sure what you get from shifting the whole thing to the world of Los Angeles private equity not a field that is world famous for its air of intellectual brinkmanship; or from giving the lead role to Paul Rudd who happens to be one of the most affable easy-going invertebrates on the planet. Advertisement ""Thats messed up"" he protests when he first hears about the scheme--and just in case we miss his principles the first time here they are again ""Thats messed up"" says his girlfriend Julie who is played by French-born actress Stephanie Szostack presumably on the principle that if you are to ransack a countrys most venerable farceur traditions you may as well grab their most winsome button-nosed actresses while youre at it. Once a new job is waved in front of him as bait Rudd succumbs thus turning the film from a story of comic deliverance visited on a snob who richly deserves it into a story of comic deliverance visited upon someone who isnt a snob but pretends to be one although really--truthfully?--he should know better. Now Im not the biggest fan of Hollywoods insistence that everyone on-screen be the proud recipient of a gleaming character arc leading them from the error of their ways into a well-lit carefully irrigated world of moral beneficence but even I could tell you that if you start introducing characters who should know better into the equation all the fun goes out of the thing. Driving down the street one day Tim run his Porsche into a sad sack in a windbreaker called Barry Speck (Steve Carell) who dusts himself off--Carell actually brushes his palms as if getting up from push-ups--and takes the occasion to show off his collection of stuffed mice dioramas. Tim has his idiot. Or does he? Steve Carells movie career has been so fitful of late that his fans have been forced into retrospection revisiting the delights of The 40-Year-Old Virginas the film that both minted and perfected the Carell persona--a fortysomething late-starter with a streak of old-fashioned gallantry behind his collection of comic-book figurines. Carell alone among the current crop of comedians doesnt play stupid--hes way too quick a venal schemer in The Office whose fine features twitch with intelligence--so I would be fascinated to learn what thinking lay behind casting him as a stone-cold dumbkopf. Carell dons some rabbity false teeth and a pudding-bowl wig the same worn by Jim Carrey in Dumb and Dumber but Carell has not thus far modeled his career on the plasticine antics of Carrey so why start now? ""Hes a tornado of destruction"" says Rudd and you think ""No hes not."" Carell is and always will be the guy standing in the path of the tornado his hand raised and a stapler attached to his tie. Actually Barry is less a character and more a series of labored comic set pieces crammed into human form. Lets see. Barry turns up to the dinner a day early taps into a line of e-communication with Rudds stalker-ex and invites her round for a spot of spanking just in time for Julie to witness the whole thing and walk out in a huff. Funny no? OK try this. Rudd has to impress a Swiss banker at lunch so Barry turns up pretending to be his brother and the stalker-ex pretending to be Julie so that he can propose marriage to her just as the real Julie enters stage left and walks off in an even bigger huff. Isnt that just a hoot? Whats Rudd doing hanging out with the guy if hes such trouble? Ah well you see he forgot his bus pass so he cant get home. Why doesnt he catch a taxi? He forgot his house keys too ... You get the picture. Roach may be the least organic director of comedy currently working in Hollywood. Other directors strive for svelte invisibility teeing up their setups so imperceptibly that all the actors have to do is roll up and take a clean spike at the ball. Roach is down in the sand pit furiously digging his way out passing off the sweaty contrivance of his set pieces as comic zaniness. Its more like a form of comic epilepsy; He whips up the performances to almost unendurable levels of frenzy and then discards them for someone new like a bored child riffling through toys. In addition to Carell we get Zach Galifianakis as a mind-reading IRS officer Jemaine Clement as a goatish artist-satyr; and thats before we even get to the dinner itself which features a blind fencer a pet psychic a guy who regurgitates food for his vulture ... This tawdry freak show is a telling substitution for the actual stupidity mocked in Vebers original. Roachs remake manages both mean-spiritedness and timidity the same time.

You know like Waiting for Godot only in reverse. Because the schmucks start showing up right as the damn movie starts and they never go away. Its like a schmuck parade marching through your head for two hours. But the only even mildly amusing moment comes at the end when we finally get to the damn dinner for schmucks and the movie at last manages to ramp up the absurdity and dispense with the sentimentality. And then that lasts only ten minutes or so and its back to exactly the same crap Hollywood has been trying to sell us for years in which characters who have been behaving intolerably and disgustingly antisocially for two hours suddenly turn on the puppy-dog eyes and were supposed to feel bad for them. The same overall effect of Dinner for Schmucks could be achieved by intercutting Three Stooges shorts with YouTube videos of adorable kittens rolling around with baby bunnies perhaps while a cute baby biting his own toes looks on. And then at the finale using some CGI magic Curlys lip suddenly quavers as he picks up a kitten and we realize were supposed to now accept him as an actual human being instead of as a live-action cartoon. The Three Stooges on their own? Fine. Kitty videos on their own? Fine. But it takes a masterful filmmaker to blend them in any way that makes sense. Jay Roach is not a masterful filmmaker. He did once manage to whip up some pure absurdity minus the sap his Austin Powers movies. But then he moved on to the likes of Meet the Parents and Meet the Fockers. Any time you can get Fockers into a movie title youre set. Or Schmucks. Look for The Fockers Meet the Schmucks the hilarious and heartwarming family film coming Christmas 2012 and the circle will be complete and the idiocracy will have arrived. Dont let hearing that Schmucks is based on the French film Le Diner de Cons mislead you into wondering if this might have a smidgen of value. This is about as arthouse foreign as Swiss Miss. It is not a deceptively genteel but deeply biting comedy of manners about human cruelty. It is Paul Rudd (Year One I Love You Man) as a corporate android getting kicked in the balls and deservedly so for two hours by Steve Carell (Despicable Me Date Night) as a sweet dolt- no wait maybe hes a dangerous sociopath- no wait hes a sweet dolt after all at which point Paul Rudd gets to live happily ever after when really he deserves to be exiled to Siberia to live out the next forty years of his life lonely and miserable. See Tim invites Barry to a dinner party/game Tims boss (Bruce Greenwood Star Trek National Treasure Book of Secrets) at the Bank of Evil hosts every month. The jerks in suits compete to see who can bring along the biggest ""idiot"" and if Tim wins he gets a corner office. Hoorah But the plan backfires when Barry shows up at Tims place a day early and ends up throwing multiple wrenches into Tims life because Barry is it seems completely unaware of how human beings interact with one another. But its all okay because Tim ends up learning a lesson along the way. The lesson that Tim learns is of course ""Dont be mean to people."" Were meant to believe that this is not a lesson Tim was capable of learning long ago but now bizarrely at the tender age of Asshhole About to Get That Corporate Promotion Hes Been Working as an Asshole to Get for Years he suddenly has an epiphany? Bullshit. Mostly the movie wants us to feel sorry for Tim who is the last person we should feel any sympathy for whatsoever. (That the very likeable Rudd is deployed as this character is perhaps the worst example of the depths of emotional manipulation to which the film will stoop.) Even the film doesnt seem to know whether Tim deserves our sympathy. Its as confused about Tim as it is about Barry. Because Tim is a schmuck you see. In case you didnt grasp that after the film has been pointing its finger and laughing not at Tim but at Barry for two hours its Tim and his corporate cronies who are the real schmucks Tim helpfully explains it for us. Except that for all the desperate meanness of this flick Tim and his buddies are not ultimately on the receiving end of any genuine punishment for their schmuckiness. All the meanness is cast at the ""weirdoes"" -- such as Barry and his boss at the IRS a would-be mesmerist played with amusing cluelessness by Zach Galifianakis (Up in the Air Youth in Revolt) who is only amusing within the context of the film because the movie treats him as the cartoon character he is and no more invites us to feel sorry for him than the Road Runner cartoons invite us to feel sorry for Wile E. Coyote. (Ditto the ludicrous artist played by Jemaine Clement who may be present to underline the theme Tim and his buddies create Its okay to be a schmuck if youve got lots of money.) This is why the actual far too brief dinner-party-for-schmucks scene within the film works Its a cartoon. Its utterly ridiculous. Its wildly nonsensical. Those are good things. But they cannot be said about the rest of the movie which doesnt seem to understand the Elmer Fudd was not a tragic hero and never would have worked as one.

And it has Paul Rudd in it too... Left_Wing_Fox But they cannot be said about the rest of the movie which doesnt seem to understand the Elmer Fudd was not a tragic hero and never would have worked as one. Ouch. stchivo This really struck with me as something I hate in movies though I cant seem to think of a another good example of this right now. stchivo oops I meant to include this quote ""characters who have been behaving intolerably and disgustingly antisocially for two hours suddenly turn on the puppy-dog eyes and were supposed to feel bad for them."" This really struck with me as something I hate in movies though I cant seem to think of a another good example of this right now. MaSch But they cannot be said about the rest of the movie which doesnt seem to understand the Elmer Fudd was not a tragic hero and never would have worked as one. Cmon Elmers ""What have I done"" moment in ""Whats Opera Doc?"" is pretty touching - in a comedic absurd way of course. And arent Wile E. Coyote and Elmer Fudd Variations of the Sisyphus type thereby representing essential existential longings and emptinesses all of us face? (Cmon MaryAnn started with bringing existentialism to this debate.) However the movie sounds rubbishy rubbish. Kat Umm...am I a bad person for admitting that I actually did feel sorry for Wile E. Coyote and that I was constantly waiting for him to finally snag that obnoxious Road Runner once and for all? The same way that I wished that Tom would finally catch Jerry whom I also found annoying? Maybe its because my favorite animals have tended to rank at the predator level (wolves foxes bats cheetahs etc.) but for some reason I usually identified with them. RogerBW stchivo I think perhaps that this is a development of the canonical Hollywood approach to falling in love (they fight for two hours then she suddenly swoons into his arms). Why bother to write actual developed characters when you can just sketch in the outlines? Human relationships are hard. Lets go shopping. Sara Glad I read this review before going to the movie. The Dinner Game-Le Diner de Cons (French movie) is clever biting ""comedy of manners"" is a favorite of mine and I feared the American version would dumb it down do away with the wit with the biting sarcasm with all the clever stuff and it seems thats the case. Perhaps the best thing would be to find a copy of The Dinner Game (French) and watch it. Ive loaned mine out to so many friends I no longer have it. Time to order another copy from amazon. (Its difficult to find.) Ill skip the American Schmucks. Sara J. J. Hunsecker An insightful review but like Kat I felt Wile E. Coyote was a sympathetic character too. Sure he was trying to kill the Road Runner but it was only to sate his hunger and not out of any malice. I felt for Wile E. because he was such an expressive character especially when he registered despair as each contraption backfired on him. (Who hasnt had a bad day where everything seems to go wrong?) The Road Runner on the other hand was a one dimensional character. However Ms. Johanson might have been referring to the few cartoons where Wile E. Coyote was paired up against Bugs Bunny (i.e. ""Operation Rabbit""). In those cartoons Wile E. was portrayed as an egotistical condescending character who seriously underestimated Bugs. In those cartoons the coyote deserved his comeuppance. Muzz Lucy Punch is in this. Id almost check it out just for that. Almost. I hope it doesnt slow her career down any. MaryAnn I felt Wile E. Coyote was a sympathetic character too. You might not have felt that way if the cartoons had felt the need to smack you in the head with all manner of cliches meant to force you to feel sympathy. Tonio Kruger Cmon Elmers ""What have I done"" moment in ""Whats Opera Doc?"" is pretty touching - in a comedic absurd way of course. Poor Elmer never got his due as a dramatic character. I would have loved to have seen him play a more serious role like say the Grandfather in Ibsens The Wild Duck. Or Pontius Pilate in Life of Brian. Now there was a role he was born to play. ;-) You might not have felt that way if the cartoons had felt the need to smack you in the head with all manner of cliches meant to force you to feel sympathy. Cough Marley and Me Cough Okay Ill go ahead and smash my broken record... Blank Frank Im probably not gonna go see this so I wont know for sure but from the review it sounds a bit like a comedy version of those horror movies that scold you for watching them. ""Lets laugh at these stupid people doing stupid things for two hours. Wait Shame on Tim and his fellow bigwigs for exploiting these losers for their entertainment."" Am I missing something or is the film really that hypocritical? Left_Wing_Fox Poor Elmer never got his due as a dramatic character. I would have loved to have seen him play a more serious role like say the Grandfather in Ibsens The Wild Duck. Or Pontius Pilate in Life of Brian. Replacing Elmer Fudd for John Travolta in a looney-tunes remake of ""Puwp Fwiction"". It writes itself. EF You know what they caw a qwarter pownder with cheese in fwance? YS No what do they call a quarter pounder with cheese? EF A Woyale with Cheese. YS A Woyale with cheese? Why those rassin frassin no good... The car shooting would be recreated with Daffy Duck and a creme pie the part of Uma Thurman would be played by Bugs Bunny in drag. Im trying to decide whether Porky Pig should replace Tarantinos cameo for a drawn out comic substitution of his infamous line or Tim Roths character with Petunia as ""Honey Bunny"". MaryAnn Am I missing something or is the film really that hypocritical? Thats pretty much it. Samantha L. I get why you say this is something youd skip because it doesnt have an intellectual plot line but thats WHY someone should go see a movie like this. For the laughs for the lulz you know? Just to go laugh your head off. I sure did. smarterthantherestofyou man is this really why people arent enjoying this film? because theyre getting wrapped up in all the sympathy theyre supposed to have for the characters or whatever the hell you were talking about? what the hell is wrong with the way you all watch movies? just laugh at the comedic aspect of it who gives a shit about the ethical treatment of FICTIONAL CHARACTERS follow search FlickFilosopher.com author   everything here is written by MaryAnn Johanson contact maryannflickfilosopher.com latest stuff new and ongoing theatrical movie releases US/Can/UK from Jul 27-29 2016s films ranked Miss Sharon Jones documentary review get up get on back up Into the Forest movie review end of the world not as weve known it Jason Bourne movie review Bourne again but why? new and ongoing dvd amp; streaming releases US/Can/UK from Jul 25-26 Disorder (aka Maryland) movie review security blank from Facebook life in the trenches from Facebook Ghostbusters passes all the tests from Facebook a few thoughts on the Wonder Woman trailer Train to Busan (Busanhaeng) movie review delays due to zombies from Facebook John Barrowman cosplays Zapp Brannigan get the daily digest by email   One quick email once a day (sent at 11pm GMT) with links to all the days new posts.

Joe Neumaier Thursday July 29 2010 400 AM Title Dinner for Schmucks Despite its schticky title the trick to ""Dinner for Schmucks"" isnt the schmucks although director Jay Roachs funny comedy adapted from a 1998 French film makes sure every group of oddballs is represented. Its how the movie plunks its characters into a normal setting and makes the jackassery into a sort of parallel world.Of course who is a jackass and who isnt is part of the storys conceit. But by dealing with corporate politics and relationship insecurity Roach sets ""Dinner for Schmucks"" firmly in a rom-com-style world. We initially see its shaggy weird and wacky characters along the edges until they come flying out of the woodwork.Tim (Paul Rudd) is an executive at a venture capital firm striving to climb the corporate ladder. He thinks if he hits it big his art-gallery worker girlfriend Julie (Stephanie Szostak) will agree to marry him. After securing a meeting with an elusive European aristocrat Tims boss (Bruce Greenwood) gives him the invite thatll get him to the big leagues A seat at his monthly dinner party.Make that seats since Tim has to bring a random eccentric person to compete in a secret biggest-loser contest. Thats where Barry comes in after being hit by Tims car while picking up a dead mouse. Barry builds elaborate cardboard dioramas featuring rodents swinging on swings and frolicking at picnics and he shoehorns himself into Tims life over two days that would make anyone envy a dead rodent.Rudd is nicely straightforward for the first half letting us see Tims conflict between his better self and the manipulative striver he thinks he should be. Yet as things get nuttier -- subplots involve Barrys supervisor at the IRS (Zach Galifianakis) who thinks he can control minds; an alpha-male artist (Jermaine Clement) and a one-night standee (Lucy Punch) with a screw loose -- Tim needs Barrys windbreaker-clad calm to help weather the storm.While the climactic dinner is a bit too much like a circus audition Roach -- who helmed the ""Austin Powers"" movies as well as ""Meet the Parents"" and ""Meet the Fockers"" -- knows how to enjoy each sideshow. And its handled with a chuckle-inducing deadpan with Rudd using his nice-guy appeal to navigate past his snarky business associates played with perfect pissant-ness by Ron Livingston and Larry Wilmore.The movie stumbles only because Carell doesnt so much play a character as a conceit. The star of ""The Office"" is in rare form but the out-there Barry wasnt written to bridge the strange and the sweet the way his dioramas do in an inspired opening montage set to the Beatles ""The Fool on the Hill."" We have to make that connection ourselves which is a little lazy if not exactly schmucky.

Comments (2) click to enlarge Dinner for Schmucks Video Rated PG-13  109 minutes  2010 In a New Yorker profile of Steve Carell writer Tad Friend described the endless filmed improvisation that goes into the average big-studio comedy these days and his piece goes a long way toward explaining why so many of these movies stink once written by wits like Ruth Gordon Garson Kanin and I.A.L. Diamond American comedies are now ad-libbed by lightweights like Jason Segel and Owen Wilson. This remake of the French farce The Dinner Game (1998) is a perfect example of the modern comedy mill gone wrong a prolonged muddle whose plot specific situations and improvised quips never line up. Corporate climber Paul Rudd invited to an exclusive dinner where each guest is required to bring along a fool for ridicule recruits prize dork Carell who makes little dioramas with stuffed rodents.

"Dinner for Schmucks Remake waters down the venom - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs 1 1/2 starsDinner for Schmucks Remake waters down the venomJuly 29 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticPaul Rudd plays Tim in ""Dinner for Schmucks.""1 1/2 stars ""Dinner for Schmucks"" is a remake for schlemiels or at least easy marks when it comes to formulaic Hollywood comedy. But the films peculiar sluggishness and nagging hypocrisy probably wont get in the way of its popularity. It has a lot of funny people going for it. The most valuable is Jemaine Clement the sonorous New Zealander who slayed in HBOs ""Flight of the Conchords"" and who even managed to make a sustained Michael York impersonation pay off in the recent ""Gentlemen Broncos."" Here he plays a supporting role as an outlandishly pretentious artist whos catnip to the ladies and whose self-regard is like a ZIP code unto itself. Also in the supporting ranks Zach Galifianakis plays a mind-reading Internal Revenue Service schmuck who wears a dickey with inappropriate clothing (though of course the dickey is not easy to pull off in any instance). In the leads the guys on the poster Steve Carell and Paul Rudd. Take a moment to review all these two have done to make us laugh in everything from ""Anchorman"" to ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" often without anything more than a sly vocal inflection. They are two of the wittiest performers in movies today. So whats my problem? We have here not a remake but a stupidization of a very good French farce Francis Vebers ""The Dinner Game"" (1998). In ""Dinner for Schmucks"" the head of a private equity firm hosts a monthly soiree in which his employees must bring an idiot to dinner and the best idiot wins. Rudds character a junior member of the firm trying to make good feels conflicted about this but into his life (and off the front of his car) bounces a pluperfect dolt played by Carell in capped teeth ""Dumb and Dumber"" hair and strangulated voice. His pathetic nature is signified by his obsession With dead mice he creates diorama-like scenes from history or his own relational train wrecks and presents them as highly personal works of art. Schmuck In Vebers original version the victim cluelessly yet systematically destroyed the life and social standing of his victimizer and the comeuppance was richly deserved. The tone of the French original was dry yet sharp skating a fine line between embracing the humiliation of its premise and exposing the cruelty of its proponents. The remake trips all over itself trying make sense of the characters and a new storyline. The character played by Rudd is a little schmucky but basically nice wanting only to give his undemanding fiancee (Stephanie Szostak) everything she ever wanted even though she says love is enough. So. No tension there. Carells performance is all tension a rare strenuous misstep. The character hes trying to play in director Jay Roachs film isnt a consistent comic creation; hes simply a collection of rubelike behavioral tics. Whats an actor to do with Roach hammering home the obviousness at every turn while failing to propel the scenes forward? Carell pulls every variation he can on the theme of social brainlessness but its an uphill battle. ""The Dinner Game"" was based on a stage play; that didnt slow down the French film version. ""Dinner for Schmucks"" runs a half-hour longer than ""The Dinner Game"" and you feel every stagey minute. I think Ill be in the minority on this one but you know comedy Nothings more personal. I found the heart-tugs at the climax almost grotesque. The French original wasnt afraid to find subtlety within cruelty. The schmucked-up American edition does the chortling for us and then as an afterthought scolds us for laughing. Or in my case not. MPAA rating PG-13 (for sequences of crude and sexual content some partial nudity and language) Cast Steve Carell (Barry Speck); Paul Rudd (Tim Conrad); Stephanie Szostak (Julie); Jeff Dunham (Lewis); Bruce Greenwood (Lance); Jemaine Clement (Kieran); Lucy Punch (Darla); Zach Galifianakis (Therman) Credits Directed by Jay Roach; written by David Guion and Michael Handelman based on the French film ""The Dinner Game""; produced by Walter F.

Dinner for Schmucks Director Jay Roach. Cast Steve Carell Paul Rudd Jemaine Clement. Rating PG-13 for sequences of crude and sexual content partial nudity and language. Exclusive Qamp;A with Steve Carell | Spotlight Translated from the French | Spotlight Paul Rudd Eccentrics in the movies | Movies about food Goofy buddy movies Check Dinner for Schmucks showtimes Bold words perhaps. But he single-handedly made ""Despicable Me"" worth watching. Now he elevates ""Dinner for Schmucks"" far above what it would have been without him making the tricky character central to the film more fully dimensional than it has a right to be. Its outstanding work. Its also a really funny movie. ""Dinner for Schmucks"" based on the French film ""Le Diner de Cons"" could easily have been dismissed as the typical ugly American remake - you know the kind of thing people warned about the American version of ""The Office"" the NBC show Carell stars in before it aired. In both cases he prevents that from happening. The American embassy ought to hire the guy for cultural relations or something. Carell plays Barry an IRS employee whose hobby is creating little dioramas with mice that he dresses and poses (he also practices taxidermy evidently on an amateur basis). Hes a sweet little dweeb of a man overeager to please hiding wounds that will become apparent over the course of the film. Of course hes also a schmuck which is exactly what Tim (Paul Rudd) needs. Why? Because Tim is an ambitious young executive on the rise and he has been invited to the monthly dinner hosted by the upper-level honchos in which each brings a schmuck to dinner. The biggest loser wins. Tim is humane enough to see the base degradation in such a game - his girlfriend Julie (Stephanie Szostak) makes sure of it - but not so much that he doesnt go through with it anyway. The problem is until he runs into Barry (literally) he has no schmuck to bring. It doesnt take long for him to realize he has found his man. But it takes him a while longer to shake Barry. Through a mix-up in which he shows up a night early Barry gloms onto Tims life with a certain desperate enthusiasm and wont let go. He puts into jeopardy Tims job his relationship with Julie his health and just about everything else in his life. At this point youre probably thinking ""I hate that kind of character."" And Im right there with you. The clueless buffoon who haphazardly destroys everything around him is typically a bane so off-putting it takes you out of the film. But thats why Carells so good here. For one thing hes really funny which helps. But he also gives Barry a sort of bruised humanity thats not usually found in these roles. Dont misunderstand hes still pathetic which is one of the better choices director Jay Roach makes. But we find out a little about what goes into making him such a lonely fellow. This is helped by the use of the dioramas some of which are laugh-out-loud funny. One in particular is so hilarious - and sad explaining much of Barrys life in a furry little miniature - that it approaches a sort of dingbat brilliance. Rudd is reliably good as a straight man as is Zach Galifianakis playing Barrys co-worker and tormentor who doesnt realize hes as much a sad sack as Barry is. Jemaine Clement meanwhile is fantastic as a wild-man artist for whom Julie works pure untamed id who justifies his decadence by calling it all part of ""process"" (pronounced with a long O which for some reason makes it hilarious). The dinner itself also is better than such a thing might sound although it follows a predictable route. Are we supposed to laugh at the schmucks or does that lower us to the level of the callous executives? If this sounds like a moral quandary Roach makes the answer clear laugh. And he has Carell to mop things up if we feel bad about it. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm. Twitter goodyk.

Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; dinner-for-schmucks ) Dinner for Schmucks (United States 2010) July 27 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli Theres something a little ""off"" with Dinner for Schmucks. The premise borrowed from Francis Vebers 1999 French farce The Dinner Game hasnt improved significantly as a result of its translation into English. The film is sporadically amusing but gives the impression it should be generating more laughs than it does. In the end it goes for the ""warm fuzzy"" feeling that so many comedies make their goal thereby undermining any potential Dinner for Schmucks might have as a dark and cynical endeavor. Director Jay Roach is the man behind two highly successful comedy franchises working with Mike Myers he created and helmed the Austin Powers saga and his collaboration with Ben Stiller resulted in the birth of the Fockers. Certainly Roach has sufficient credibility in Hollywood to pick and choose his projects so one wonders why The Dinner Game remake struck his fancy. Perhaps he believed he could do better with an English-language translation especially with the likes of Steve Carell and Paul Rudd on board. However as is typically the case with even mediocre foreign comedies Hollywood remakes rarely improve on the original. At least in this case it isnt worse. As the story opens upwardly mobile executive Tim Wagner (Paul Rudd) is angling for a major promotion. His boss Fender (Bruce Greenwood) likes his aggressiveness - not to mention the potential financial windfall that could accrue from one of his suggestions - but Fender wants to see how ruthless and creative Tim can be and this results in a dinner invitation. Its not just any dinner party however. Each guest must bring an ""idiot"" with him and the biggest idiot earns a trophy. For Tim the stakes are higher - if his guest wins he gets the promotion. His girlfriend Julie (Stephanie Szostak) finds the concept morally reprehensible and temporarily talks Tim out of participating - until he encounters the perfect idiot. IRS employee Barry (Steve Carell) enters his life when Tim accidentally hits him with his car. Barrys hobby is taxidermy - he makes Hummel-like scenes using dead mice as the central characters - but he has an even more impressive talent. After knowing Tim for only a few hours he has nearly ruined the mans life. Its not that Dinner for Schmucks isnt funny but that the humor is less consistent than one might hope. It represents an adequate night out for those in search of a few good laughs but it fails to enter the upper echelon of top-flight comedies despite the involvement of several talented performers. Steve Carell does something interesting with Barry. The character starts life as repugnance personified but Carell spends the bulk of the movie redeeming him; when the inevitable ""feel good"" scenes arrive late in the proceedings the audience is on his side. Paul Rudds task is thankless - hes the straight man the guy to whom all the bad things happen. The Hangovers Zach Galifianakis fills a supporting role as Barrys off-the wall co-worker and Brit Lucy Punch has what may be the films most memorable part as the Samp;M-loving stalker who targets Tim. The scenes featuring Punch while sit-com-ish in nature offer a sampling of outrageous humor (at least insofar as anything in a PG-13 rated motion picture can be considered ""outrageous""). Although it initially seems that Dinner for Schmucks might be headed for a dark comedy zone - some of its early material is off-putting - it eventually settles for middle-of-the-road screwball territory. Its less interested in alienating viewers with excessive cruelty than it is in taking the characters along a familiar odd couple/buddy movie journey. So despite a seemingly fresh beginning it doesnt take long before Dinner for Schmucks starts to feel like 75% of the comedies out there that feature mismatched males as the leads. It would be easier to overlook the films rather uninspired trajectory (not to mention its too-long 115 minute length) if it was funnier but the material perhaps constrained by the need to keep it teen-friendly never gets raunchy enough or barbed enough to take flight. Like a lot of what the summer of 2010 has had to offer this movie comes close to justifying a matinee price for those who arent too demanding about what they see but its hard to see it being worth paying much more.

Thats the problem. The promising crudeness of the title along with the combined talents of stars Steve Carell and Paul Rudd suggests that at some point surely someone will rise to the occasion and behave with unrepentant obnoxiousness. But in a rare tonal misfire director Jay Roach (Austin Powers Meet the Parents) delivers a bland summer-sloppy comedy that never risks actually swimming with schmucks and letting characters bruise themselves on outcroppings of mean fun. Instead he has decided to sand away all the sharp edges. Whats left is a nice safe comedy of tolerance and repentance -- a subpar Carell-and-Rudd odd-couple buddy movie. Thats quite a feat considering that Dinner for Schmucks is about heartless businessmen scum who gather to see which one can bring the biggest unsuspecting ""idiot"" to a recurring dinner party. For what its worth Le Diner de Cons -- the award-winning 1998 French movie on which this American version is based -- never needed to stage the dinner party itself so adept was veteran director Francis Veber at letting idiots be idiots and scum be scum. (Semantic aside Having done its work as an attention grabber in ad campaigns the word schmuck is never uttered in the movie itself; the feckless snobs playing the game including Bruce Greenwood Ron Livingston and The Daily Shows Larry Wilmore all refer to idiots.) But then Roach is a sharp dude who is on record saying that Vebers film is ""nearly perfect."" So Ill wager a snobs meal that its the studio execs who are the real schmoes here. Either way in a sign of comedy aesthetics to come a wannabe player named Tim (Rudd) literally runs into Barry (Carell) The former is behind the wheel of his spiffy sports car and the latter is crossing the street in pursuit of a mouse. Barry you see is an IRS civil servant and amateur taxidermist whose obsessive artistic hobby is dressing stuffed dead rodents in handmade outfits and posing them in fanciful tableaux. Never mind that Barrys exquisite installations are gallery-quality creations of great charm. (Coolio filmmaker Wes Anderson would be wise to appropriate the wee figures for a follow-up to Fantastic Mr. Fox.) Were meant to laugh because the artist calls them ""mousterpieces"" and the medium is the message. Rudd is a reliably appealing screen presence who excels at playing funny-handsome-smart-exasperated guys who flirt with weaseldom. Hes one of the few hip comic actors around who can easily play mean and still not alienate his fan base. But Rudd has little to do besides rotate facial expressions of frustration vexation and in the end reconciliation. Tim has moral qualms about going along with the dinner game but theyre temporarily overridden by a desire to get ahead in business so his gallerist girlfriend (Stephanie Szostak) will be impressed enough to marry him. The logic is lousy from the get-go as the GF is immediately established as an artsy humanist horrified by shark-tank business practices. In an effort to spice up the unsalted stew Dinner for Schmucks gives a lot of room -- a desperate amount -- to two pungent comedians in minor roles. In a subplot adapted from the French film Zach Galifianakis lays down his deadpan stares to little effect as Barrys IRS colleague with self-proclaimed powers of mind control. And in a subplot that in altered form wisely took place off camera in the original Flight of the Conchords Jemaine Clement bulldozes the film as a preening artist-of-the-moment whom Tim mistakenly believes to be his girlfriends lover. (The guy is such a pompous ass that her fidelity is never in doubt.) Similarly Tim is himself being pursued by a former lover (Lucy Punch). And to prove that shes no real threat to conservative monogamy either the production takes pains to demonstrate that the lady is a coarse casually misogynist joke of a sexually voracious crackpot. Of course Tim is in the clear having dumped the ex before he met the lady he loves. Otherwise hed be a real schmuck.

Steve Carell plays Barry a schmo (yes you need Joys of Yiddish to read this story) who makes dioramas featuring dead but cute mice. Hes invited to dine by a group of self-satisfied businessmen who hold a regular contest to see who can bring along the most obnoxious dinner guest. Barrys competition for freak of the week includes a blind fencer a ventriloquist with a dirty-mouthed puppet and a pet psychic who communes with the spirit of the lobster entree. The scene which was largely improvised has the feel of a ""Dueling Banjos""-style throwdown as each actor strives to out-funny the next. Its tailor-made for Carell and his compatriots in unbridled lunacy including costars Paul Rudd and Zach Galifinakis. The funny thing is Schmucks is actually a remake of the French comedy The Dinner Game. Even funnier the French version ends before the freak-show dinner can take place.Thats because as the French version makes clear the dinner is not the point. Schmucks is putatively about the relationship between ""normal"" businessman Tim (Rudd) and his freak and tweaking our idea of which one is the actual schmuck (tagline Takes One to Know One). But the American version is about more than just male bonding its a glimpse into how truly conservative our comedy has become.Dinner for Schmucks is directed by Jay Roach who made Meet the Parents and along with Adam McKay Judd Apatow and others specializes in comedies featuring normal nice guys--shmoes not schmucks--who are pushed to their limits. (Think of Paul Rudd and Seth Rogens psychedelic-mushroom freakout in Knocked Up.) But these movies are much safer than they appear. In Dinner for Schmucks it is quickly and firmly established that the only reason nice-guy Tim agrees to participate in the rope-a-dope dinner is because he wants to get ahead at work and the only reason he wants to get ahead at work is so his girlfriend will marry him. Of course we know that his logic is flawed his girlfriend cant really care about how much money he makes; otherwise we wouldnt root for him to wind up with her. But it allows his character to remain sympathetic. In the French film Pierre (the Tim character) is unconflicted about the dinners--he finds them hilarious. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week The imperative of modern American comedies is that the protagonists change and grow and that growth always takes place in the direction of societal norms. In Knocked Up Ben becomes a responsible father. The 40 Year Old Virgin and Forgetting Sara Marshall conclude with their protagonists in happy relationships while I Love You Man and The Hangover end in weddings. Though the premise of Dinner for Schmucks is deeply cruel we are supposed to laugh because we trust that by the closing credits the characters will have matured into upstanding men. Too bad Hollywood doesnt give the audience credit for being mature too.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

"Movie Review Dinner for Schmucks - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Girlfriend Movie Review Dinner for SchmucksJuly 30 2010|By Roger Moore Sentinel Movie CriticDinner for Schmucks kills an awful lot of time getting around to its titular dinner. Like the French film (The Dinner Game) it is based on it takes a leisurely gambol up to the party in which a bunch of arrogant rich each bring a dolt to dinner so that they can mock them. But like a four-star desert at the end of a hit-or-miss four-course meal the finale is worth the wait. Paul Rudd stars as Tim a go-getter at his investment firm a sixth floor ""analyst"" ready to move up to the top floor to making the deals and earning the money to pay for his Porsche and art dealer girlfriend (Stephanie Szostak) girlfriend. The boss ( Bruce Greenwood) may be interested. But Tims got to pass a test. He needs to meet and recruit a dope -- the bigger the dope the better -- for the companys monthly dinner party the Dinner for Schmucks. Tim is still weighing the moral implications (the girlfriend doesnt approve) of this when --thump -- he bowls over a dazzling candidate with his car. Barry played by Steve Carell with a vacant stare and a malignant giggle was in the street to ""save"" a dead mouse. He stuffs them dresses them up and poses them in dioramas -- scenes from life recreations of famous paintings. And lest you think hes simply certifiable -- hes got a job as an IRS agent. He was once married. Hes mastered his cell-phone. ""My password is P-A-S-S-W-O-R-D."" He just wears clip-on ties and a windbreaker cannot pick up a social signal for the life of him mis-remembers song lyrics and butchers the language (""Im an eternal optometrist""). And since Tim believes ""Everything happens for a reason"" its a date. His accident victim will be his guest at dinner. But Barry shows up a day early and proceeds to wreak havoc. In a day Tims lost his girlfriend had his car and apartment trashed faces an audit by by the IRS and has almost lost the deal that got him the promotion in the first place. All this and the dinner hasnt even been served. Director Jay Roach (Austin Powers Meet the Parents) keeps the tone more naughty than raunchy. He doesnt fret over the films sluggish pacing. The overlong opening credits set us up for a movie that takes a while to get up to speed. But my stars and garters -- the laughs friends. The laughs build and build and the little character turns by everyone from Little Britains David Walliams (as a dorky Swiss millionaire) and Flight of the Conchords Jemaine Clement (as a pretentious dim and oversexed artiste) to Octavia Spencer (as a psychic who talks to dead pets and the lobsters who are the main course at dinner) are an embarrassment of comic riches. And as funny at playing the kind-of-innocent/kind-of-obnoxious game as Carell can be wait until Zach Galifianakis shows up. The breakout star of The Hangover is the icing on this dessert cart -- a demented believer in his powers of ""mind control"" whose delusion is fed by Barry who believes this guy really does control his mind. ""Demented"" works for the whole movie from its bizarro art show and performance art stunts (featuring Clement) to the crazed and kinky ex-girlfriend ( Lucy Punch a scream) and the vast collection of Barrys twisted little ""mouseterpieces."" The situations are painstakingly set up and downright painful to sit through. So enjoy or endure the appetizers because with this Dinner dessert is truly the topper.

Scott like David Brent before him was cruel and obtuse a nightmare of a boss who thinks hes a leader of men.But in the United States audiences didnt take to so bleak a comic vision and soon Michael Scott was transformed from a monster into a genial buffoon--a lovable lovelorn doofus who may behave badly at times but whose heart is generally in the right place. The tone of the series evolved from harsh satire to affectionate gentle comedy. Ratings success ensued. Thats a lesson well learned by the filmmakers behind Carells new movie Dinner for Schmucks an American reworking of the 1998 French comedy Le Diner de Cons.Francis Vebers original a short sharp comedy of manners was ostensibly about a weekly dinner party to which wealthy businessmen bring carefully selected idiots. But in fact the movie never makes it to the dinner party in its 80 minutes. Instead it punishes its ostensible protagonist--a jerk of a book editor who revels in the delights of the dinner with idiots--with an escalating series of indignities and tortures most of them innocently perpetuated by his moron for the night. That is to say for all the fun poked at short goony Francois Pignon (Jacques Villeret)--who makes maquettes of world landmarks out of matchsticks--the film hates his asshole tormentor so much that it is fundamentally on the side of the idiots.Not so Dinner for Schmucks directed by Jay Roach which takes the snobbish cruel editor of the original and turns him into Paul Rudd the nicest young man youre ever likely to meet. Rudd plays Tim an analyst at a private-equity firm who is only gunning for a corner office to convince his girlfriend that hes marriage-material. ""Thats messed up"" Tim says upon hearing about the dinner for schmucks and hed never do it if he wasnt forced into it by circumstance. He quotes Baudelaire for goodness sakeMeanwhile bowl-cut windbreaker-wearing Barry (Carell)--the schmuck in question--is not just an unctuous bumbler like Francois Pignon but is in fact borderline mentally disabled. That is the only conclusion I can reach after watching credulous Barry 1) admit that he has no idea what a clitoris is; 2) take the admonition ""Dont leave that chair"" so seriously that he carries the chair with him wherever he goes; and 3) gleefully smash bottles of wine against the walls of Tims apartment. The only thing he is good at is making intricate little dioramas out of taxidermied mice--dioramas that are thanks to this films impeccable technical credentials so lovely and miraculous that you dont understand why everyone in the movie thinks theyre so stupid.Casting my mind back over Carells career for an analog to Barry I was reminded not of Michael Scott or Andy Stitzer the blithely virginal 40-year-old Carell played in his breakout role. Instead Barry seems like a close cousin to Brick the near-incoherent weatherman (""I love lamp"") with an IQ of 48 whom Carell played in Anchorman The Legend of Ron Burgundy. So essentially what we have here is a mainstream comedy in which a totally nice guy has his relationship and career nearly ruined by Brick Tamland but then at the end has to make a speech about how Brick Tamland is really the best--and not an idiot at all. I hope you can see why maybe that story wouldnt be as touching as the filmmakers apparently think it is.Dinner for Schmucks is funny sure. How can it not be with good comic actors like Carell and Rudd--plus Zach Galifianakis Jemaine Clement Kristen Schaal and Ron Livingston? (Stephanie Szostak who plays Tims girlfriend isnt funny at all but dont worry Shes extremely pretty.) Even if some bits fall flat--the carnivorous ex-flame of Tims played by Lucy Punch for example is aggressively unfunny--any movie starring that many talented comedians knitted of the funniest stuff in a reported 900000 feet of film is bound to have its share of laughs.And rest assured no American comedy is going to call itself Dinner for Schmucks without showing us the actual dinner for schmucks which is naturally this movies comic apogee. Theres a blind fencer and a ventriloquist whos married to a slutty dummy and a guy who French-kisses his vulture. Theyre all idiots or possibly mentally ill. Paramount Pictures and director Jay Roach would like to invite you to a dinner theyre hosting at which you are welcome to laugh at these poor jerks. Thats a little messed up.

Paul Rudd plays the straight man while Steve Carell charitably tackles the lonely loser who stumbles into his humiliation scheme in ""Dinner for Schmucks"" an uproarious odd-couple remake of Francis Vebers hit French farce ""The Dinner Game"" (once second only to ""Titanic"" at the Gallic B.O.). American adaptations of Vebers works have been all over the map from ""The Birdcage"" to ""Fathers Day"" (when DreamWorks optioned ""Dinner"" it too was intended to star Robin Williams). Here helmer Jay Roach takes the wickedly un-PC premise and renders it positively benign emerging with a nutty crowd-pleaser in the process. The setup is simple Find a schmuck bring him to dinner. The guy with the biggest idiot wins. (Also no mimes. Too obvious.) The films goal established over the course of one disastrous evening is to demonstrate that the idiot isnt necessarily the guy you expected going in. Except Carells Barry really is an idiot -- a bumbling yet blissfully unaware imbecile in the grand tradition of such Steve Martin characters as Navin R. Johnson (""The Jerk"") Ruprecht (""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"") and Clouseau (""The Pink Panther"") -- which makes the silliness that ensues all the more entertaining. The poor sod is a buck-toothed badly toupeed taxman who wears his windbreaker even when indoors smells like a mix of aftershave and formaldehyde (or so were told) and spends his free time making detailed dioramas with dead mice. (These elaborate creations very nearly steal the show designed by Joel Venti and executed by the Chiodo brothers the cult effects trio who crafted the puppets for ""Team America World Police."") Barrys appeal is a question of taste really Either such a goofy caricature never grows old or he proves unbearable from the moment he first appears onscreen. (In the case of the pics trial-by-fire Montreal premiere before a room of Veber-philes he had the crowd in stitches.) The real wild card is Tim (Rudd). In the original version the characters cruelty rubbed American auds wrong but here screenwriters David Guion and Michael Handelman (who together scripted ""The Ex"") make him a reluctant participant in boss Fenders (Bruce Greenwood) tacky dinner plans. As it happens Rudds just the sort of sad-sack star who can have you rooting for such an otherwise unconscionable scheme. (Its one thing for Sacha Baron Cohen to turn up to for dinner and humiliate his hosts as the ""Schmucks"" exec producer did in ""Borat"" but another for well-heeled Americans to make fun of unsuspecting morons. Such a thing simply isnt done.) The social tension underlying the whole equation suggests an opportunity for some truly provocative comedy (in the vein of Lars von Triers ""The Idiots"" perhaps) but ""Schmucks"" plays it safe sticking with screwball and thats just as well. Other Veber ideas have translated rather naturally in past American remakes (consider ""Pure Luck"" ""Three Fugitives"" and ""The Man With One Red Shoe"") but ""The Dinner Game"" features a number of culturally specific Frenchisms including fear of tax audits and the ultimate faux pas of allowing ones wife to meet ones mistress. Thus Roach and the writers take plenty of liberties in the adaptation particularly in expanding the scope of the film (""Game"" adapted from Vebers own play seldom left the main apartment) but they still manage to hit an impressive number of the originals key points along the way. The most notable addition is the mean-spirited dinner itself which provides the outrageous finale the original lacked. The fact that Barry can keep up with the larger-than-life characters around him is a testament to Carells wide-eyed appeal. The movie is a veritable whos-who of comedic talent boasting formidable cameos from Zach Galifianakis (as the boss who stole Barrys wife) ""Little Britains"" David Walliams (as an eccentric Swiss millionaire whose account could save Tims job) Kristen Schaal (who plays Tims secretary like an extension of his id) Lucy Punch (a psychotic old flame from Tims past) and Jemaine Clement (as a hirsute Damien Hirst-style art fraud). Theres no shortage of schmucks to go around in other words. If any part of the equation feels anemic its the relationship between Tim and his would-be fiancee Julie (Stephanie Szostak). Barry arrives mid-spat and inadvertently drives them apart but the truth of the matter is the story is so focused on him and Tim that theres not much room left to worry about romance. Roach (""Meet the Parents"" ""Meet the Fockers"" the ""Austin Powers"" movies) handles the rest quite ably keeping things pitched at such a preposterous level its hard to imagine anyone being genuinely offended -- no small feat given the gross-out nature of most contemporary comedies. Bright lensing and Theodore Shapiros peppy score help strike an appropriately aloof tone.

TWITTER ""Dinner for Schmucks"" mocks its central buffoon as mercilessly as the soulless execs it would scold for doing the same thing. NEW YORK -- A tale of new-friend stalkerdom so extreme it makes ""The Cable Guy"" look tame ""Dinner for Schmucks"" mocks its central buffoon as mercilessly as the soulless execs it would scold for doing the same thing. Though not as guffaw-rich as previous efforts by the talents involved it comes close enough to the mark to please their fans spelling strong boxoffice appeal if not comic edge. Though titled for the novel premise it borrows from the French film ""Le Diner de Cons"" -- wealthy businessmen hold a party in which their bizarre guests are unwittingly competing for a ""biggest idiot"" trophy -- ""Schmucks"" is actually more interested in the tortured relationship between one of the idiots in question Steve Carells Barry Speck and the young striver Paul Rudds Tim Conrad who invites him to the function against his better judgment. After the two meet accidentally Speck latches onto Conrad and refuses to let go upending his love life and career in a matter of hours with lapses in judgment viewers must strain to accept. Where Carells ""The Office"" character Michael Scott combines outrageously bad judgment with vanity and self-delusion Barry Speck is enough rungs down the IQ ladder that laughing at him is nearly unpleasant. If not for an occasional bit of good schtick (Speck playing dead in the face of danger for instance) we might be inclined to shake our heads in sorrow and walk away. Speck is however an idiot savant as a hobbyist creating utterly charming dioramas out of stuffed mice wearing tiny costumes. Conrads co-workers may find them pathetic but these creations supply the film with some redeeming moments of soul. Though Carell and Rudd are both saddled with characters that just arent as interesting as many theyve played in the past the movie benefits from having drawn many gifted comedians to supporting roles. Screwy performances from actors like ""Little Britain"" vet David Walliams provide surprising pleasure alongside those (by Zach Galifianakis and Jemaine Clement) we already expect to be comic highlights; each adds a note or two of weirdness that is much needed here. Director Jay Roach shows more restraint than he did in ""Meet the Parents"" and its sequel. Even in its free-for-all climactic sequence (where inevitably curtains go up in flames and the mighty are brought low) the action never reaches the point of stimulus overload. A good thing given how broadly the screenplay has been lobbing indignities at the target pinned to Carells hapless but innocent schmuck.
