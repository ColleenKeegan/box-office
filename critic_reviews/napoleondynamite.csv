Comments Napoleon Dynamite Recommended Rated PG-13  86 minutes With its horribly geeky and painfully needy characters this black comedy by Jared Hess bears a certain resemblance to Todd Solondzs Welcome to the Dollhouse but steers clear of Solondzs punishing nihilism allowing its hopeless misfits some genuine comfort in one anothers friendship. Jon Heder plays the title character a furious spaz who trudges the halls of his Idaho high school wearing moon boots and wildlife T-shirts; his home life is dominated by his nerdy older brother (Aaron Ruell) whos carrying on an Internet romance with a Detroit ghetto girl and his frustrated uncle (Jon Gries) whos constantly reliving his high school gridiron career. Toward the end the freak-show humor begins to yield diminishing returns but for most of its length this delivers a steady stream of uncomfortable gut laughs. By J.R.

Made for under 500000 Hesss debut feature has to date taken more than 43 million at the US box office. Its a handsome payout and proof that there is hope for small American filmmakers looking to compete with their big budget compatriots.Not that any such cynical profiteering informed 25-year-old Hesss original gameplan to turn his hit short film Peluca a zero-budget comic take on his small hometown of Preston Idaho into a full-length subversive skit on the typical high-school comedy. Napoleon (Jon Heder) is our focus a teenage boy so unattractive so awkward so out-of-sync so damn wrong that he ultimately endears himself as an outlaw and fully-fledged hero. The obvious parallel is Dawn Wiener in Todd Solondzs much superior Welcome to the Dollhouse. Like Dawn Napoleon does himself no favours. He wears moon boots and bad T-shirts; he likes to sketch unicorns and ligers (an imagined hybrid of a lion and a tiger); and he doesnt know the first thing about friendship or romance. His dysfunctional family is equally bad older brother Kip has the worst moustache in history and spends all day on internet dating sites while Uncle Rico is a failing door-to-door salesman whose big dream is to return to 1982 and resurrect his stalled football career. Its a cast of brilliant caricatures and as such recalls the films of Wes Anderson especially Rushmore.Admittedly much of the humour is very silly - feeding on sight gags and slapstick - and not all of it hits the mark. But theres a serious side too. The embarrassments of school and teenage life are up there to squirm at in both shame and horror.

Jon Heder in NAPOLEON DYNAMITE Photo taken on 4/7/04 in  CA. Publicity photos from the Fox Searchlight film ""Napoleon Dynamite."" Jon Heder in NAPOLEON DYNAMITE Photo taken on 4/7/04 in  CA. Photo Aaron Ruell Napoleon falls too much in love with its own nerdiness 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Napoleon Dynamite Comedy. Starring Jon Heder Efren Ramirez. Directed by Jared Hess.Written by Jared Hess and Jerusha Hess. (PG. 82 minutes. At Bay Area theaters). The geek comedy ""Napoleon Dynamite"" has to be enjoyed in spurts. Theres no cohesive story just a series of opportunities for the title character (Jon Heder) to strut his gawky stuff. Watch Napoleon handle an unruly chicken. See him perform a sign-language translation of Bette Midlers ""The Rose."" Witness him sucker-slap his equally dorky brother. Married filmmakers Jared and Jerusha Hess seem to have let their love for Heders performance cloud their storytelling judgment. You can see how it happened. Heders Napoleon might wear the lopsided fro of screen nerds before him but hes a singular presence demanding respect instead of seeking acceptance. Hes a mouth-breather with a quick temper who would fight the school bully if his antihistamine werent holding him back. The comic setups are rather geek-movie conventional for a picture that keeps trying to announce its differentness. ""Napoleon"" is unique only if you gauge uniqueness by an inability to tell the era in which a film is set. Napoleons Idaho high school classmates seem to be living in 2004 but they slow-dance to Cyndi Laupers ""Time After Time."" The house where the boy lives with his grandma is replete with fake wood paneling a top-load VCR and ticky-tacky decor that nobody within 300 miles of a Wal-Mart would still have. The filmmakers want to evoke the ""Sixteen Candles"" era of geekdom without committing to a period movie or acknowledging whats happened in the intervening years. Napoleons three-piece 1970s thrift-store suit was unfashionable in 1984 but today it looks like something a San Francisco hipster might wear. The films best moments happen between Heder and Efren Ramirez as a Mexican immigrant student whos innately cooler than Napoleon but mellow enough to appreciate him. One deft exchange hints at what might have occurred had the Hesses worked harder to buck convention. Spying a pretty girl in the cafeteria Napoleon asks his pal ""Do you dare me to go talk to her?"" The Ramirez character responds with a very mild ""sure"" as if reluctant to follow the teen movie cliche of the deluded fellow geek. Key questions are left unanswered.

"Nerdy and peculiar Napoleon turns on charm - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Nerdy and peculiar Napoleon turns on charm By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  June 18 2004 ""Napoleon Dynamite"" was the big buzz hit at the Sundance Film Festival in January but honestly any movie that shows at midnight at 7000 feet above sea level has already had much of its work done for it. Now that this shoestring oddity has descended to the lower altitudes it can be seen for what it is an inspired dead-end stunt that keeps delivering snarky laughs far longer than it has any right to. The films attitude remains high and it probably wouldnt hurt if the audience was too.Directed by Brigham Young University film graduate Jared Hess and written with his wife Jerusha ""Napoleon"" suggests Todd Solondzs ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" stuffed into the confines of an MTV interstitial skit. In segments so deadpan as to seem disconnected the film sketches out the dire adolescent life of the title character (Jon Heder) a gangly Idaho Brillo-head whose nerdiness has achieved cosmic proportions.Napoleon lives in ranch-house misery with his dirt-biking grandma (Sandy Martin) her pet llama Tina and his 32-year-old brother Kip (Aaron Ruell) a scrawny ankle-sock-wearing shut-in who spends all day chatting up ""babes"" on the Internet. (The brothers sissy-fights are a highlight of the films early scenes). Hes a figure of derision to his schoolmates -- especially queen of mean Summer Wheatley (Haylie Duff already well on the road to becoming sister Hilarys evil B-movie twin) -- but Napoleon is too ornery to be a sad sack. His eyes screwed shut behind aviator glasses arms and legs jutting out like a grasshoppers the character just seems deeply and comically exasperated. How was school? someone asks. ""Worst day of my life"" Napoleon barks in response. ""What did you think?""Hes a cartoon in other words but so peculiar and unique as to be nearly heroic. Plus he has a way with women. ""I see youre drinking 1 percent"" Napoleon tells a girl. ""Is that because you think youre fat? You could probably drink whole milk.""""Napoleon Dynamite"" keeps bringing on the freaks to the point where the estate of Diane Arbus should arguably have been cut a check. In addition to Napoleon and Kip theres their Uncle Rico (Jon Gries) a toupeed ladies man whose latest shady business venture is selling herbal breast enhancers door-to-door; new kid Pedro (Efren Ramirez) another cafeteria outcast who mounts a surprising bid for student council; Ilene (Ellen Dubin) a Tupperware-obsessed housewife; and Deb (Tina Majorino) Napoleons possible love interest and a portrait photographer whose instructions to her subjects run along the lines of ""Imagine youre in the ocean surrounded by tiny seahorses.""Theres a lot more of this -- every scene is a brightly lit 1950s postcard of precision kitsch -- but Hess keeps the laughs coming with timing worthy of Jim Jarmusch and a narrow but controlled performance by Heder as the films King Geek.Be warned though Some people find this movie cruel in the extreme -- an exercise in empty style that pins its misfits to the wall like captured butterflies. By contrast its fans (and Im one with reservations) know that what makes Napoleon a hopeless spazzola is also what makes him better than all the Summer Wheatleys. He just hasnt realized it yet.Similarities to ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" are obvious not to mention the entire oeuvre of Wes Anderson. ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is the more optimistic film though and also the lesser one. What remains to be seen is whether Jared Hess has another movie in him -- a real movie about real people.

His red frizzy hair looks like wire brush bristles that have been stretched and tortured into the shape of an ice cream scoop. (Theres a side parting as if Napoleon occasionally makes half-hearted stabs at coiffure.) His mouth sags open as if its closing mechanism has a permanent malfunction. And his cool swagger -- complete with body-hugging jeans and T-shirt as well as soft-leather shin-high boots -- blissfully ignores his obvious nerditude. He claims to own nunchucks. He pretends to have a girlfriend. He refuses to surrender to anyone even the bully that regularly strangles him and bashes his head against his locker door. And his monotonal patter is given to sudden exclamations of ""Goooosh"" and ""Idiot"" directed at whoevers annoying him lately. ""What are you going to do today Napoleon?"" A kid asks one morning as Napoleon makes his way to the back of the school bus. ""Whatever I feel like I want to -- goooosh"" he says peeved. He throws a little plastic figurine attached to a long thread through the window. Holding on to the string he watches it bump and bounce on the road behind the bus all the way to school. And another Napoleon day begins. Directed by Jared Hess (and co-written with his wife Jerusha Hess) ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is definitely a one-shtick movie. And there is the nagging thought that laughing at these characters amounts to ridicule. But then theres the counter feeling that this is no different than watching a live-action version of say Mike Judges TV cartoons (""Beavis and Butt-head"" ""King of the Hill"") or a hinterland spin on Todd Solondzs suburban geek-epic ""Welcome to the Dollhouse."" And I wonder if it isnt just as condescending and elitist to refrain from laughing at characters in Americas cow-pasture land as if they are beasts in a wildlife preserve that need our sanctimonious protection. I laughed. And I laughed primarily over Heders hilarious performance. You aint seen nothing till youve seen Napoleon attack that tether ball. Napoleon spends most of his time weathering the weirdness of his family. His grandmother likes to drive fast on her dune buggy. Her injury resulting from this pastime forces Napoleons incredibly bizarre Uncle Rico (Jon Gries) to watch over Napoleon and his reclusive thirty-something brother Kip (Aaron Ruell) who spends his life exploring Internet chat rooms. Rico who loves to admire his biceps and make home videos of himself throwing a football is Napoleons biggest scourge. Is there a story? Sort of. Napoleon befriends a new student named Pedro (Efren Ramirez) whose withdrawn heavily accented demeanor makes him a social outcast. But as we learn he is completely self-respecting and doesnt care what the unenlightened think. (There is no scorn here; quite the opposite.) In fact Pedro decides to run for school president against the overwhelmingly popular Summer Wheatley (Haylie Duff -- Hilarys sister). Despite what seems to be a miserable existence -- the ""normal"" world (like all those Judge cartoons and ""Dollhouse"") is just too horrible to deal with -- Napoleon has a sort of indefatigable life energy. And when he decides to work for Pedros campaign (his suggested campaign slogan ""Vote for me and all your dreams will come true"") he shows no fear of standing up against the majority. And theres some hope that hell get it together to become romantic with sweet shy Deb (Tina Majorino). But in this kind of a movie who knows? Thats the charm of it. You have no idea whats next. Napoleons final act to save Pedros flagging campaign is the movies big punch line. It doesnt amount to much in the dramaturgical scheme of things. But theres something so funny and liberating about the performance it doesnt matter. You find yourself laughing at Napoleons antics but youre definitely rooting for him. Ultimately you realize hes cooler than everyone. NAPOLEON DYNAMITE (PG 86 minutes) -- Contains some sexual innuendo. At Landmarks Bethesda Row and Cineplex Odeon Dupont Circle.

"Napoleon Dynamite Misfits Like a Glove washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Movies Napoleon Dynamite Misfits Like a Glove Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 18 2004 You havent seen anything till youve seen Napoleon Dynamite do the funky chicken. Well all right its not the funky chicken. You can see some funky chicken buried in it if you look carefully though most of the moves show the influence of the Los Angeles dance masters Popin Pete and Kool DJ Herc. Napoleons freezes do need some work and his back swipes and corkscrews could be a little smoother. Still you cant miss him. Not because hes a great dancer but because hes about seven feet tall he has a red Afro his mouth is half open and his eyes are half shut and most of the other boys like to beat up on him. And hes the most E.T.-looking white kid you ever saw. Napoleon is big but weak so soft he cant ball his hand into a fist. That makes him the clown prince of Preston Idaho and as played by Jon Heder in the magnificent ""Napoleon Dynamite"" hes one of the most winning movie creations in years. Of Napoleon it cannot be said that he marches to a different drummer. No what he marches to is an instrument so unique it has no name and its melodies are beyond the capacity of the human ear to receive. Napoleon maybe 17 (though Heder turns out to be 26) has a stretched-out pillowy body that he cannot quite control and that keeps ramming into things. He has the eye-hand coordination of a Ukrainian weightlifter pickled in a vat of vodka. When he runs -- slowly tragically like a glacier melting -- he holds his elbows close to his body as if theyre made of porcelain and will break. No wonder its so much fun to crush him against a locker on the way to math class. As a consequence of his advanced studies in exile loneliness and disconnection exacerbated by a family whose dysfunction is epic Napoleon has cultivated a rather thorny personality. Hes extremely acerbic; hes cruel and unsupportive; hes a chronic liar a teller of self-aggrandizing tales so lame you wonder why he tries. (""My girlfriends in Cleveland and she was going to fly in but she had a modeling assignment."") Hes also transparently needy throwing himself at those he suspects are snacks in the high school food chain. So whats not to love about a misfit so galactically misfitted as this? Its a signal irony that a movie shot for 200000 by a Mormon couple (director Jared Hess and his wife Jerusha Hess also the co-writer) in Idaho opens nationally on the same day as Steven Spielbergs 100 million ""The Terminal"" and that ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is every inch the superior product. Its tight resonant funny as hell seriously bent and whacked and also wonderfully healing. Thats because its about diversity really. Its text may be whiteness but its subtext is blackness. Its about a couple of mutant white kids pushed to the margins of their own tribe who embrace black culture and find liberation peace and dignity to say nothing of emotional nourishment. It ends up saying quietly and without strutting this great American thing We are each other and we are more alike than different and we can profit so much from that connection. Napoleon and his even more pathetic brother Kip (hysterical Aaron Ruell) a 32-year-old bespectacled pervert in Bermudas and knee socks trolling the chat universe for undercover officers to talk dirty to live in a tiny house in a West so vast and barren it makes you yearn for a friendly McDonalds. The far-off mountains are picturesque but between here and there lies a Siberian plain the color of dead goats. The brothers are nothing they have nothing they do nothing they are going nowhere slow. Their one connection to the galaxy is grandma who in the early going breaks a bone in a dirt-bike accident (Granny has a life) and so Uncle Rico (Jon Gries) -- a loser so big his hobby is videotaping himself throwing a football to recall the glory day in 1982 when he almost got into the game -- moves in for the free lodging. As a director Hesss specialty is the deadpan announcement. He sets the camera down lets his characters enter the frame at their own pace make an announcement freighted with serious dementia and then he cuts rapidly away so that youre really laughing not at what was said but at his refusal to underscore it in a conventional way. Plot? Not a lot. But enough. Napoleon desperate for friends but too repressed to be friendly clumsily engages Pedro a transfer played equally deadpan by Efren Ramirez; his outstanding trait is that he owns the only mustache in school. Pedro is also either foolhardy or clueless as he tries to date girls way up the social ladder and then finally runs for class president against Summer Wheatly (Haylie Duff) the coolest of the cool girls. So you might say that the film is about the revenge of the nerds how Napoleon and Pedro usurp the high school pecking order. But it doesnt concentrate on that. The Hesses storytelling style is whimsical episodical in the end anecdotal and almost but not always winning. We follow Kips attempts to woo a woman in a chat room who turns out to be the savior of his life; we go with Kip and Uncle Rico as they try to sell Tupperware to farmers wives; we go with Napoleon to a new job at a chicken farm and behold the horror of a million squawking eggbirds in a stalag of mesh wire under a corrugated tin roof. Mistakes are made. A riff about a time machine that Uncle Rico orders off the Internet to get back to 1982 is ridiculous even if Gries (son of the excellent director Tom Gries) is always funny with his hairpiece and his entrepreneurial delusions and his eternal overestimation of his charm. The manipulations by which it turns out that Napoleon must dance before the whole school in order to deliver the election for Pedro are quite thin though its organically rooted in the plot as part of Napoleons secret plan to de-geekify himself by studying a hip-hop dance tape. But the movie builds to the moment when Napoleon in his space boots and T-shirt with his red foam of hair and his tiny eyes blown up by his aviators must do the thing itself . . . the music comes on . . . the feet begin to twitch the legs begin to shimmy the hips begin to pump. At that moment you realize how expertly Heder has hidden his true grace and how hard he has worked on finding a body and a style of movement for Napoleon and how totally convincing the artifice has been. Now shedding it he finds the magic. Its really the best six minutes of movie Ive seen this year the big ungainly boy seizing the moment giving himself up to the music and transfiguring before our very eyes into something that although still damned strange is utterly compelling and even poignant. ""Napoleon Dynamite"" rules. Napoleon Dynamite (86 minutes at the Cineplex Odeon Dupont Circle and Landmark Bethesda Row) is rated PG for what the MPAA calls ""thematic elements"" whatever that means.

"Napoleon Dynamite is a charming ode to nerds. Slate Sign In Sign Up Napoleon Dynamite is a charming ode to nerds. Napoleon Dynamite is a charming ode to nerds. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 14 2004 513 PM My Own Private Waterloo Napoleon Dynamite is a charming ode to nerds. By David Edelstein Quirkiness ... Mormon-style Napoleon Dynamite (Fox Searchlight) was this years up-from-nowhere hit at Sundance where ""quirky"" regionalism plus a sort of East Village zombie deadpan goes over big with the folks who are too cool for school. To me it looked like a Mormon stab at Wes Anderson--which might be for some people an enticement. The director Jared Hess (who devised the script with his wife Jerusha both recent graduates of Brigham Young) uses the Idaho farm landscape cannily as a great blank stage on which affectless nerds move in horizontal lines like sleepwalkers or stagger back into the empty landscape toward the horizon line. The movie has some indelible moments but it tends to put your brain at half-mast. Half-mast is how the movies teenage protagonist moves through the world. Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder) is neither Napoleonic nor dynamic which is I guess the joke. (The name an Elvis Costello alter ego makes Hess the second Mormon after Neil LaBute in The Shape of Things to use Costello to no particular end recently.) Hes tall and skinny with frizzy hair and he breathes through a sea-anemone-shaped mouth nearly filled by two giant front teeth. What you notice though are his eyes--or rather the lack of them. Most of the time Napoleon stares under lids three-quarters closed at a spot several inches to the east of his lap. When the new kid at school Pedro (Efren Ramirez) turns out to be a mouth-breather who stares dopily in the same direction you know its a love match. They can look at nothing and trade monotonic non sequiturs all day. Advertisement The director loves those non sequiturs. This is the sort of movie where theres a shock cut from the placid farm of Napoleons grandmother (Sandy Martin) to a buggy speeding toward a sand dune then an insert to show you its grandma in the buggy. Then grandma realizes shes about to hurtle into oblivion. While she recovers from a cracked coccyx the resourceful hustler Uncle Rico (Jon Gries) comes to look after Napoleon and his older brother Kip (Aaron Ruell) a 30-year-old stay-at-home bed-wetter who spends hours in an online chat room with a Michigan woman named LaFawnduh. Uncle Rico has never gotten over a football loss in 1982 and he makes the brothers watch a video in which he throws one football after another in the direction of the camera. ""This is pretty much the worst video ever made"" says Napoleon. ""Like you would know that"" sneers Kip. I loved that exchange. And after about 40 minutes (of 86) I began to enjoy the one-thing-after-anotherness and the minimalist wit of the actors embodying many different species of nerd. Soon a plot sort of half kicks in and Napoleon finds himself half-working to get a date for the prom and the unassertive Pedro elected school president. The wit is in what isnt said--in the paralyzing horribleness of Napoleons courtship the revulsion of the girl when he sketches a supremely unflattering portrait and the sight of the pair entering the prom to the strains of ""Forever Young"" as if anyone would want to be watching this. Well there are blessings. Just when were sinking into a Todd Solondz morass Napoleon Dynamite becomes a sort of half-romance when Napoleon half-expresses affection for the shy Deb (Tina Majorino) by presenting her with a large frozen bass. The climax is the only all-out moment a triumphant dance number in which the tension between Napoleons frozen face and suddenly elastic bopping body is jaw-dropping. Napoleon Dynamite is too low-wattage to be a true nerd anthem but its charming in retrospect when youre freed from the narcoleptic pace to think back on the queerly beautiful tableaux and well-timed gags. Its like Wes Anderson on Quaaludes. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air.

The cats pajamas Garfield takes luxurious breaks from his task of searching for the missing dog Odie. Rhythm amp; Hues Garfield The Movie   Not even Bill Murray could save Garfield. Perhaps the comedian -- so pitch-perfect as the sardonic actor in Lost in Translation -- got too deeply into character. In voicing the lazy fat cat he didnt draw upon his own distinctive wit to add heft (or subtlety) to the felines one-liners. Instead Murray delivers bland recitations. Visually the lasagna-loving feline comes to life capably enough via computer. Every other creature is human or animal and the humans do a much less professional job than their four-footed counterparts. Garfield is loving his lackadaisical existence until his owner (the blandly pleasant Breckin Meyer) brings home a dog Odie whom fans of the comic strip will remember as Garfields nemesis. The slyly clever Garfield casts the lovable mutt out one night then is struck by guilt and drags himself off the couch to hit the streets in search of the peppy pooch. But Odie has fallen into the clutches of a conniving local TV show host (an over-the-top Stephen Tobolowsky). There are chases fights and a host of adorable and noble beasts coming to Odies rescue. Still the movie falls flat. Garfields tagline is ""Its all about me-ow"" The emphasis should be on the ""ow"" (PG brief mild language) -- Claudia Puig Napoleon Dynamite   1/2 There isnt much Napoleonic grandeur in this Idaho-set high school comedy which in spite of its most condescending instincts does have its moments. It helps to approach this debut feature and Sundance hit in the context of being shot on a small-town dime. When we watch geeky Napoleon (Jon Heder) get shocked by a so-called time machine (mostly metal batteries and headwear) one does have to concede an attitude often missing from pricier screen endeavors. Yet husband-wife team (Jared and Jerusha Hess) apparently have no love in their hearts for the no-hopes theyve created. Napoleon is socially maladroit and is a constant pummeling target for standard-issue jocks. His uncle (a funny Jon Gries) is a jock wannabe convinced he should have been an NFL quarterback instead of a salesman of plastic dishes. Meanwhile Napoleons pal Pedro (Efren Ramirez) is in over his head running for class president against a vapid school queen (Haylie Duff Hilarys sister).). The Hesses who are only in their mid-20s know how to set up gags and even capitalize on them. But their opening salvo seems outrageous just for the sake of it. In Fourth of July terms its pop is less dynamite than firecracker.

Mostly though its a catchy catchphrase in search of a movie -- a thrift-shop Wes Anderson pastiche masquerading as the latest in cult-film haute couture. Hess film arrives more or less fresh from Sundance where it was acquired by Fox Searchlight during the festivals first weekend for an estimated 3 million but judging from the reaction there -- and at a local screening I attended two weekends ago -- the movie seems destined to divide audiences. Either you find Napoleon Dynamite the epitome of all thats right with American independent cinema today or exactly the kind of movie by which independent movies may sow the seeds of their own demise. Set in Hess hometown of Preston Idaho Napoleon Dynamite is about its titular supergeek (Jon Heder) and how his fondness for one-man tetherball games and sub-Jackass stunts performed on an undersized bicycle do little to endear him to the other kids in school. Neither does Napoleon harbor much fondness for his 30-something older brother (Aaron Ruell) who whiles away his days in online chat rooms nor for his ATV-racing grandmother (Sandy Martin) who insists that Napoleon care for her pet llama. And when Napoleon speaks the words come out in an exasperated huff as though the world and all its denizens were just one big cruel burden placed on his shoulders for the devils amusement. Of course similar things could be said of the iconoclastic misfits at the center of almost any youth picture that prefers oddballs to prom kings including three fine entries from earlier this year -- Noi The Girl Next Door and Mean Girls -- and in particular Andersons Rushmore a film on which Hess seems to have overdosed. (Like Anderson Hess is a detail fetishist and while he lacks anything resembling Andersons fluid sense of visual direction hes packed Napoleon Dynamite with the hideous relics of his own coming-of-age knee socks moon boots Velcro-sealed Trapper Keepers top-loading VCRs.) But those movies had outsider heroes we could actually relate to -- we could get behind their Sisyphean struggles to make their voices heard in the world and break out of their socially dysfunctional prisons. Napoleon Dynamite conversely does nothing but hold Napoleon (and his entourage of eccentric friends and relatives) up for ridicule; theyre a bit like the sissy characters in pre-Code Hollywood films or almost any characters in the lazier exercises of the Coen brothers. Up to and including a breakdancing finale that some have mistakenly identified as the movies compassionate turning point Hess is so eager to make us guffaw that he solicits only our crassest instincts asking us to revel in the misfortunes of those who look or talk ""funny"" or -- in what makes for an unsavory underpinning to much of the films alleged humor -- who live somewhere in the neighborhood of the poverty-line. If Napoleon Dynamite really is as reported a semiautobiographical exercise it is one of the most astoundingly self-hating such exercises in memory. Yet the trick works for some as it did for the throngs of college-age moviegoers who burst their appendixes laughing through a recent promotional screening. And indeed theres a sense in which Napoleon Dynamite is more promotion than movie -- from Foxs agreeing to distribute the film to more than 1000 theaters to its aggressive Internet advertising campaign even to a Napoleon Dynamite frequent-viewer club that rewards repeat ticket buyers with eligibility for prize drawings. And so it may be that Hess has passed with flying colors through his own initiation ritual delivering the sort of mass-marketable crossover product that helps make the indie-film world seem ever less like a creative universe unto itself and more like a lobster tank full of aspiring Hollywood hacks ripe for the boiling.

And many establish their updated identities at new addresses by laughing at the places they pray to God theyve left safely behind. Sometimes dorkdom is a function of geography (""Fargo"") sometimes of mind-set (TVs ""Freaks and Geeks""). But whatever its genesis geekitude requires wounded anger (""Welcome to the Dollhouse"") confident style (""The Royal Tenenbaums"") or bleak compassion (""Ghost World"") to advance the attitude from that of fashion statement to affecting art. At this point in the cinema of psychological slacking we ought to demand more from a story about how its hip to be square than deadpan faces and thrift-shop decor. But judging from this years slick faux-cornpone comedy Napoleon Dynamite affectless laugh-at-the-locals humor has become the easiest way for an indie filmmaker to cash in on his past while preparing for a lucrative Hollywood studio comedy career. Set in the vaguely extraterrestrial Preston Idaho the 2004 Sundance crowd-pleaser has got the tableaux suitable for Diane Arbus photos down pat but no real interest in the people negotiating those life situations. The title character (Jon Heder) a gangly high school alpha nerd is notable for his head of frizz reminiscent of a heartland Frederick Douglass and his tendency to mutter ""ID-iot"" at the iniquities of daily existence at Preston High School. Napoleon - the name suggests parentage of some wit although no Dynamite parent makes an appearance - would have been a piquant extra in the background of a ""Mean Girls"" lunchroom scene. But filmmaker Jared Hess (who cowrote the script with his wife Jerusha Hess) installs Napoleon front and center as a punchline in and of himself - and as that dispiriting product of narrative defeat a symbol. But of what? Is Napoleons life really so miserable in the snug brick anywhere-in-America house he shares with his grandmother (Sandy Martin) and equally noodly older brother Kip (Aaron Ruell)? Granny enjoys dirt-bike racing and keeps a pet llama; Kip acquires a girlfriend in an online chat room a vavoomy black woman named LaFawnduh (Shondrella Avery) who arrives by bus and appears to truly dig her milquetoast man - why is that worth laughing at? Napoleon befriends a sad-eyed Mexican classmate named Pedro (Efren Ramirez) who asks the schools snippiest queen bee (Haylie Duff sister of Hilary) to the prom and dares to run for class president Why is that so hilarious? Where school life in ""Election"" and ""Rushmore"" becomes a crucible out of which character is forged ""Napoleon Dynamite"" treats lifes humiliations and triumphs as interchangeably insignificant. This leaves audiences free to laugh without caring - a defense that indeed detracts from a better appreciation of Heders marvelously singular performance in the title role. The 26-year-old Brigham Young University graduate assumes the Gumby posture of the socially challenged so believably that when Napoleon busts out in a climactic snake-hipped dance sequence in front of the whole Preston High population the sight is a sexy shock. Frizzy sizzle like this has got to come from someplace. Geek-chic movies that dont bother mapping the route are nowheresville.

"Napoleon Dynamite | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; napoleon-dynamite ) Napoleon Dynamite (United States 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli Napoleon Dynamite should be required therapy for anyone with a self-image problem. No matter how much of a loser a person believes himself to be he couldnt possibly be in worse shape than the protagonist of Jared Hess wickedly funny high school comedy. With a low-key sense of humor and without the slightest whiff of sentimentality Hess delivers a film about geeks that makes Revenge of the Nerds look like the Hollywood tripe that it is. Napoleon Dynamite isnt about a cute cuddly inoffensive movie nerd; the main character is morose antisocial and has a working understanding of what happened in Columbine. Theres plenty of humor in the film but the movie is often a little uncomfortable to watch and Napoleon is not an easy guy to like. Rooting for him takes effort. One of the reasons why Napoleon Dynamite works is because of its tone. Hess and his actors underplay everything. Similarities to the work of Wes Anderson may be coincidental but they are present. In many ways the comedy is funny because the actors arent playing the material for laughs. These individuals believe in their characters and that conviction comes across. And if Napoleon and his friends arent entirely likeable who says they have to be? As were laughing at these characters were warming up to them. John Heder plays Napoleon like a teenager who doesnt quite fit into his long lanky body. The performance is dead-on. I dont know if Heder was a nerd in real life but he certainly makes us believe. He subsists on a farm with his Uncle Rico (Jon Gries) a 30-something ex-jock who lives in the past and his freaky older brother Kip (Aaron Ruell) who spends most of his waking hours in Internet chat rooms. Despite looking like hes old enough to have completed college Napoleon is still in high school where he occupies the lowest rung of the social pecking order (getting slammed into a locker by someone bigger and more self-assured is a daily occurrence). Napoleons only friend is Pedro (Efren Ramirez) the ""new kid."" Napoleon doesnt have a girlfriend but he has his eye on Deb (Tina Majorino) - until Pedro beats him to the punch by asking her to the upcoming dance. So Napoleon has to settle for going with the daughter of one of his uncles clients. Not much happens during the course of Napoleon Dynamite. This is essentially a meet-and-greet movie where we spend about 85 minutes getting to know the smart sullen socially maladjusted Napoleon. The biggest events are the dance and the school election in which Napoleon becomes Pedros campaign manager. And as in all movies about losers theres a chance for a measure of redemption and Napoleon Dynamite shows its good heart by allowing for a ray of hope at the end. Director Hess (who wrote the film with his wife Jerusha) has a dry wit and is unconcerned about mocking his characters but he doesnt let the end credits come without showing them some affection. So although Napoleon Dynamite may not be the most immediately endearing protagonist to grace the silver screen this summer theres something memorable about him and the motion picture that bears his name.

An absurdist piece about a rural community of clueless cretins who careen through life like poorly played pinballs ""Napoleon Dynamite"" represents the definition of the comedy of condescension and ridicule. There are lots of laughs for those who enjoy the sight of bottom dwellers doing stupid things that make them look even more idiotic and pics fans and detractors may be very strictly separated by a generation gap with viewers in their teens and early 20s repping its prime enthusiasts. Still this rare Idaho-made effort which was picked up after its Sundance first screening by Fox Searchlight could easily be the latest example of the ""Happy Texas"" syndrome a picture that hits big at Sundance but cant find its way in the real world. Exhibiting a style that makes Todd Solondz look like an exemplar of big-hearted generosity toward his characters director-cowriter Jared Hess studied film at Brigham Young University where he met his co-writer and wife Jerusha and producer Jeremy Coon. Hess short ""Peluca"" showed at Slamdance last year. Tall gawky bespectacled gape-mouthed and capped with a frizzy carrot-top Napoleon (Jon Heder) bumps around high school with his eyes barely open and speaks in a whiney tone of perpetual and angry exasperation. Girls steer clear of him other boys hammer him at will and life generally sucks. Things arent any better at home a plain little place he shares with Grandma and much older brother Kip (Aaron Ruell) the latter a wimpy nerd who spends most of his day chatting on-line with a faraway romantic soulmate. When Grandma lands in the hospital after a dune buggy accident the boys are looked after by Uncle Rico (Jon Gries) an aging macho man tormented by thoughts of how his life would have been different had his team won the state football championship back in 82. In fact except for a few tell-tale signs like the Internet and certain musical cues these characters could easily be living more than 20 years ago; fashion-wise thats definitely where theyre at and everyone is made to look so completely out-of-it that it seems a miracle that anyone in Preston Idaho -- Hess hometown where pic was shot -- can get even get through school hold down a job or pay taxes much less become a cultured or civilized creature. But story and plausibility dont constitute the glue that provides ""Napoleon Dynamite"" with its sense of continuity. Credit for that goes to the consistently uncouth gross dim and anti-social behavior that Napoleon and all those around him indulge in. Hess gets off quite a few surprising gags that have an effect simply because they come so suddenly and so completely out of left field; people throw things like steak at each other for no reason Uncle Rico begins hawking herbal breast enhancements door-to-door Napoleon gets a date by sending the girl a grotesque drawing of her and Kips soulmate when she shows up in the flesh turns out to be a hot black mama from Detroit who immediately transforms her whitebread correspondent into a kerchief-and-chains-wearing gangsta. Compounding the arbitrary anything-for-a-laugh approach is pics eagerness to take cheap shots whenever possible to belittle the characters distant hopes of ever getting a life. When Napoleon decides to help new friend Pedro (Efren Ramirez) the schools lone Latino in his campaign to become class president against a popular blonde ones elemental rooting interest is thwarted because they have nothing going for them nothing to say. Napoleon pulls a rabbit out of a hat by performing an unexpectedly rousing dance at the school assembly but this seems more than anything like a calculated feel-good moment meant to pave the way toward an unearned happy ending for the most downtrodden of the towns losers. In their own deadpan way thesps are winning with the awkward long-limbed Heder in the title role providing undeniable gravitational weight at pics center. Gries and Ruell have their comic moments as well even if the material theyre working with is not to ones taste. While the films cheapness cannot be disguised production values are respectably professional for a work by kids right out of school. Napoleon DynamiteProductionA Fox Searchlight release.
