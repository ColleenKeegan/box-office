Brothers Marlon and Shawn complete the Wayans comedic dynasty - the publicity for Little Man calls them the most successful African-American filmmakers in cinema history (Spike Lee and John Singleton take note).Little Man like Wayans previous film White Chicks fails as check-your-brain-at-the-door entertainment and for the same reason its a concept not a movie. The concept is that Marlon Wayans face looks really funny shrunk down and digitally attached to the body of child actor Linden Porco. Together theyre Calvin Simms a midget gangster on the lam who disguised as a baby hides himself and his loot in the household of newly-engaged Darryl (Shawn Wayans) and Vanessa (Kerry Washington). They take him in. Eventually little pumpkin butt gets unmasked but not before endearing himself to the couple by making out with their busty white friend sexually harassing a busty beer-girl at a hockey game and watching the couple have sex. Its adult slapstick comedy for children apparently. Keenen Ivory Wayans loved the nine-year-old Porco because Linden got every joke. I couldnt shake the image of Porco wandering around without a head. Marlon Wayans achieves an occasional laugh using only his face helped by a series of really cute baby hats. He did his scenes within the solitary confinement of a green screen stage - sad no?

Starring Shawn Wayans Marlon Wayans Tracy Morgan and Kerry Washington. Directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans. (PG-13. 99 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Historians will remember 2006 as the summer movie season when everyone got urinated on by dogs. ""See No Evil"" ""Garfield A Tale of Two Kitties"" and now ""Little Man"" have all featured a canine-on-man golden shower as a punch line. Among Hollywood scriptwriters guys getting peed on appears to be the new testicle kick or maybe the new getting-hit-on-the-head-by-a-frying-pan. Actually the latest movie by the Wayans brothers features all of these things plus 20 or 30 more gags that youve probably seen in scores of other films. The makers of ""White Chicks"" must be counting on their audience not getting out to the movies a lot or suffering from low-grade amnesia. Or maybe the gap is widening between mainstream filmgoers and movie reviewers. Two other critics in my aisle appeared to walk out before ""Little Man"" was half over and yet the rest of the audience burst into spontaneous applause at the end as if this were the latest Pedro Almodovar movie premiering at Cannes. Im absolutely positive that this is not a good film and equally confident that it will make twice as much money as ""Poseidon."" The one piece of originality in ""Little Man"" is the premise. Marlon Wayans is Calvin Sims a tough-guy jewel thief who is also a little person. (Wayans actually plays the head while two little-person actors play the body and computers do the rest.) When his attempt to steal a huge diamond goes bad he poses as a baby in the suburban home of Darryl and Vanessa Edwards portrayed with little humor by Shawn Wayans and Kerry Washington. The script was written by Marlon Shawn and director Keenen Ivory Wayans -- all formerly of the ""In Living Color"" team and the amount of disbelief that the Wayans brothers expect the audience to suspend is mind-boggling. In just the way that the white chicks in ""White Chicks"" looked like burn victims Marlon Wayans is so unconvincing as a baby that it becomes infuriating. He has molars He can beat up a grown man The rickety lean-to of a story ensures that key events in the movie -- such as the decision to drop the diamond in Vanessas purse -- happen for no other reason but to further the plot. Basically its a bunch of gags most of which youve seen in the trailer strung together by any means necessary. This could still be sort of funny if those gags were particularly good or even slightly original. But most of the jokes fall in one of two creepy categories -- slapstick having to do with the babys superhuman strength or slapstick involving the babys sex drive. Meanwhile the brothers rip off everything from Looney Tunes cartoons to ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" -- even going down the lets-make-fun-of-Barney-the-Dinosaur road one more time. (After ""Death to Smoochy"" youd think this joke was retired for good. And yet here we are.) Adding to the sense of moviegoer deja vu Chazz Palminteri shows up as a mob leader Rob Schneider shows up as a goofball loser and theres a violent family football game just like the ones in ""Meet the Fockers"" and ""Wedding Crashers."" At least no one gets urinated on during the end zone dance. -- Advisory This movie contains strong language violence and sexual situations. Moviegoers should also be warned that the Wayans brothers have expressed interest in building a movie studio in the East Bay. Make sure you see one of their films before deciding whether this is a good idea.

You three whoever you are and dont even tell me your job is to make a movie as good as Little Man directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans and written by Wayans and his two brothers Shawn and Marlon who actually star. You have one year."" Cut to The Academy Awards 2008. ""Ladies and Gentlemen it is my distinct pleasure to announce that the Best Picture of 2007 is Little Man The Remake directed by Three Random People on a Bus. Folks please come up and get your Oscars and well see you at the big party at Chasens."" No it wont happen. But it could. Theres no reason why it couldnt if someone just had the gumption to make it happen. Meanwhile in the real world ""Little Man"" is about what youd think a movie in which a man masquerades as a baby would be. Every orifice is covered and the product of every orifice is also covered and the vocabulary that describes both the orifice and its product is detailed. Hmmm thats about it. The gimmick features Marlon Wayans -- actually Marlon Wayanss face -- magically computer-painted on various aspects of two little persons named Linden Porco and Gabriel Pimental who jointly get the strangest film credit in history ""Calvin (body)."" Marlons face and Linden and Gabriels body play the jewel thief Calvin who in the confusion of a major job dumps his loot in a womans purse and must therefore penetrate her house to reacquire it. He pretends to be a baby in order to get into it. The woman played by super good sport Kerry Washington takes him to her bosom and her bed (the one good joke). Meanwhile her husband (Shawn Wayans) frets and dithers in the background while Calvin (body and face) tries to get the jewel -- and outside the house various thinly imagined criminal types try to also get the jewel. As I said orifices and their products and thats about it. Little Man is an extremely hard PG-13 (for sexual innuendo). It is 90 minutes long and playing at area theaters.

"Little Man is inanely entertaining - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Little Man is inanely entertaining By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  July 14 2006 Frankly the prospect of a movie starring Marlon Wayans as a 36-inch-tall ex-con pretending to be a toddler did not excite me but the films enthusiasm for the lowest imaginable humor and Marlons seemingly boundless skill at bringing it off are contagious. (His head has been digitally snapped on the lively little bodies of Linden Porco and Gabriel Pimental.) Everybody looks like theyre having fun in ``Little Man"" another inane outing from the Wayans brothers. And with some ineptly made comedies thats good enough.I laughed at the Wayanses movie and I dont even hate myself for it. The truth about the familys brand of comedy -- Keenen Ivory directs Marlon and Shawn act and all three usually write the script -- is that they like their audiences. Were not insulted and were not pandered to either. One major surprise in ``Little Man"" is how it quietly takes up the cause of proud black paternity -- Shawn plays the guy eager to adopt Marlons impostor baby -- without saying ``Look were taking up the cause of proud black paternity"" A heart beats beneath the obligatory collection of breast-milk spit takes toys to the groin and urine and flatulence gags.When Marlons 3-foot thug Calvin steals a huge diamond that ends up in a handbag carried by Kerry Washington he acts like the child she and her fiance Darryl (Shawn) sort of want. Shes an upwardly mobile career woman; hes ostensibly careerless -- and broke too. (The pitiful engagement ring he gives her has a vacant setting.) When Calvin arrives dropped off by the uniquely funny Tracy Morgan as Calvins vividly stupid right-hand man they cant help falling in love with him. Washington is especially good at registering baby Calvins freakish qualities (that tattoo that shank wound those muscles) then forgetting about them in the very next scene. Thats bad moviemaking. But it could also just be pure love.With the Wayans es  its hard to tell the difference. 2000s ``Scary Movie"" was as close to a masterpiece as bad filmmaking is likely to come. Ugly and haphazard as it was (Keenen Ivorys style is ruthlessly point-and-shoot) the original ``Scary Movie"" was part Mad magazine spoof part acute social bulletin the best film ever made about black people experiencing popular culture. There was nothing haphazard about its sense of perception -- the Wayanses knew how to tell a joke. (They dumbed the movies up.) ``White Chicks"" from 2003 should have been even better but the gags never rose to the level of the conceit -- Marlon and Shawn dismantle ``white culture"" by going undercover as Beverly Hills ditzes. ``Little Man"" is superior to ``White Chicks"" because its not really going for anything. Its brazenly mindless farce.The brothers get antic support from Molly Shannon and Alex Borstein from Wayans regulars Lochlyn Munro and Brittany Daniel as a roid-raging dad and his bodacious wife and from ``In Living Color"" vets Kelly Coffield Park and David Alan Grier. Playing Washingtons Calvin-suspicious father the expertly grizzled John Witherspoon in his least crass film role steals the movie. But the Wayans es are disarmingly egoless comedians. They want everybody in their films to be funnier than they are.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

"Little Man comes up a little short - USATODAY.com SearchHow do I find it?Subscribe to paper Home News Travel Money Sports Life Tech Weather Movies Cars  Event tickets   Jobs Real estate  Shop   Online degrees ABOUT THE MOVIELittle Man  1/2 Director Keenen Ivory Wayans Stars Marlon Wayans Shawn Wayans Kerry Washington Tracy Morgan Distributor Sony Pictures Rating PG-13 for crude and sexual humor throughout language and brief drug references Running time 1 hour 30 minutes Opens Friday nationwide Little Man comes up a little short Posted 7/13/2006 940 PM ET E-mail | Print | By Scott Bowles USA TODAY Almost in spite of itself Little Man manages to deliver big laughs. Its not enough to make it a consistently funny movie but this one-trick pony from the Wayans brothers has flashes of humor and sincerity that almost save it from its disastrous ending. Calvin (Marlon Wayans) is a criminal as tough as a 2-by-4 and not much taller. At just under 3 feet the half-pint thug wants to shake his criminal past after of course one last big score. The movie directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans begins solidly enough particularly with a jewelry heist that ends in a scuffle in a duffel bag between Calvin and a Chihuahua. When the heist goes bad Calvin leaves a 100000 diamond with an unwitting suburban Chicago couple (Kerry Washington and Shawn Wayans). After trying to sneak into their home disguised as a baby Calvin is taken in by the couple who want to try their hand at child-rearing. The plot is as paper-thin as it sounds. That the couple isnt troubled by Calvins tattoo bridge work and mature genitalia is a pretty good sign that they should never have children of their own. But the Wayans brothers have shown serious chops as writers with their Scary Movie franchise and they find some solid footing here. Calvins accomplice played by Tracy Morgan is an aspiring singer who gives a hilarious rap about luncheon meats. The Wayans also give the film moments of real heart with scenes about men who desperately want to be fathers -- and others who never had one. And visually Man pulls off one of the top technical effects of the year. The 6-foot-2 Marlon Wayans acted the role entirely in front of a green screen and his face was digitally imposed on a 9-year-old actor. The effect is utterly convincing. But there are only so many ""ga-ga goo-goo"" jokes a film can maintain and ultimately Man collapses under its own shaky premise. When the film runs out of clever parenting scenes it resorts to gross-out jokes and humor that borders on offensive such as when Calvin tries to breast-feed with a neighbor and sleeps with his adoptive mother. By movies end Man becomes a pale imitation of Home Alone with bumbling thugs and slapstick humor that even Macaulay Culkin would find juvenile. Still give the Wayans brothers some credit. For a movie that could have fallen flat on its infantile face Man scores some points for thinking big. Posted 7/13/2006 940 PM ET E-mail | Print | Enlarge Revolution Studios Calvin (Marlon Wayans) opens wide for his pediatrician as his adoptive parents (Kerry Washington and Shawn Wayans) look on.

Everyone else should steer clear. Not without its share of inspired crudities this vulgar violent comedy should provide decent counterprogramming during a blockbuster-heavy frame drawing the usual overlap of urban audiences and Wayans brothers devotees. There are probably some moviegoers who can laugh at the sight of a groin-punching breast-grabbing baby possibly even find it cute. Everyone else should steer clear of ""Little Man"" which welds Marlon Wayans head to a diminutive body double offering up the creepiest bigscreen dwarf since the last David Lynch movie. Not without its share of inspired crudities this vulgar violent comedy should provide decent counterprogramming during a blockbuster-heavy frame drawing the usual overlap of urban audiences and Wayans brothers devotees. The brothers work on the ""Scary Movie"" franchise notwithstanding ""Little Man"" may just be their scariest movie yet with credit going entirely to its mesmerizingly freaky title character. Played by Marlon whose head has been digitally grafted onto the body of 9-year-old thesp Linden Porco (Gabe Pimental is also credited as a double) Calvin is a hardened thug who stands exactly two-foot-six in height (a cousin perhaps of Tony Coxs pint-sized burglar in ""Bad Santa""). Fresh out of prison Calvin teams up with his hapless accomplice Percy (Tracy Morgan) to steal a diamond from a jewelry store. In the course of their clumsy getaway the gem winds up in the possession of an unsuspecting married couple Darryl (Shawn Wayans) and Vanessa (the appealing Kerry Washington). Darryl is eager to start a family with his wife and Calvin thinking quickly (which is to say not at all) dresses himself up as a baby and has Percy leave him in a basket on the couples doorstep. Confused yet touched Darryl and Vanessa decide to keep the foundling until they can get in touch with social services. This immediately strains credibility as the only plausible reaction to Calvins monstrously un-babylike appearance -- as a result of some obvious visual effects work Wayans face looks too big even as his head looks too small -- is to laugh or recoil. (Hes about as convincing as the white chicks in ""White Chicks"" the Wayanses previous feature.) As the ""Baby Geniuses"" pics have firmly established theres nothing remotely charming about the sight of tots talking fighting or otherwise behaving like mini-adults and ""Little Man"" takes the conceit to hideous extremes. The film at least seems aware of how grotesque its central creation is as evidenced by the reactions of Vanessas cranky instantly suspicious dad (John Witherspoon) as well as Darryl and Vanessas friends -- played by Alex Borstein Fred Stoller Brittany Daniel and Lochlyn Munro -- who are barely able to conceal their revulsion. But not even Calvins tattoo his knife scar or his very active libido convince his besotted new parents that something is wrong with their little bundle of joy. Helmed by Keenen Ivory Wayans from a script he wrote with brothers Marlon and Shawn the comedy hinges on Calvin being subjected to every possible indignity while also enjoying the benefits of his pampered new lifestyle. The recurring comic motif is sexual humiliation with Calvin serving as both unwilling recipient (hes probed by a rectal thermometer) and horny assailant (he gropes a woman bouncing him up and down in her lap). At one point he crawls into bed with Ma-ma and Da-da in a skin-crawling scene that invites the viewer to laugh at what amounts to a rape. Mostly though the pic falls back far too often on Calvins propensity for violence specifically his habit of punching those body parts within his reach. Brutal slapstick reaches an unfunny climax when a stereotypical Italian mobster (Chazz Palminteri) and his cronies force their way into Darryls home in search of the diamond resulting in scenes that play like a wisely discarded alternate version of ""Home Alone."" Marlon Wayans accessorizes his weirdly committed performance as baby Calvin -- all bug-eyed lip-jutting facial expressions and nauseating goo-goo-gah-gahs -- with an impressively embarrassing wardrobe of bonnets bibs beanies and booties courtesy of costume designer Jori Woodman. Some additional levity is provided by the brief isolated appearances of Molly Shannon and Rob Schneider (both ""Saturday Night Live"" alums along with Morgan). Also worthy of mention is the sound design which contains one of the most gurgly and grotesque renderings of gastrointestinal distress ever captured.
