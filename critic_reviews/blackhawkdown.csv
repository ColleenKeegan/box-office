Comments Black Hawk Down Rated R  143 minutes Reviewers often talk about whether a war movie shows war as it is; I wouldnt know and Im not sure how some of my colleagues could either. I also dont know how well this 2001 drama--based on journalist Mark Bowdens book about a U.S. military action in Mogadishu Somalia--represents the events of October 3 and 4 1993 though I can see that it represents them in a realist vein referring to other war movies without becoming frivolous. A mission goes so badly that the brave and overwhelmed soldiers have to rescue one another but the movie though passionate doesnt pity or flatter the rank and file. Nor does it pass judgment on the brass--or ultimately even on offscreen ""characters"" Mohamed Farrah Aidid and President Clinton. Ridley Scott directed a screenplay by Ken Nolan; with Josh Hartnett and Sam Shepard.

Pic is based on journalist Mark Bowdens bestselling account of the 1993 fiasco in Mogadishu Somalia which left 18 American soldiers dead and more than 70 badly injured. War is hell for 100 continuous minutes of screen time in ""Black Hawk Down"" a relentless immersion in combat strikingly realized but none too pleasurable to sit through. Based on journalist Mark Bowdens bestselling account of the 1993 fiasco on the streets of Mogadishu Somalia which left 18 American soldiers dead and more than 70 badly injured this grim piece of work forcefully puts the viewer in the middle of the action in a harrowing way. But it crucially lacks almost everything but fighting most particularly characterization making Ridley Scotts second picture this year after ""Hannibal"" almost entirely about logistics. Very well judged in its philosophical stance toward the material this collaboration between Revolution Studios and Jerry Bruckheimer at Sony goes down like stiff medicine leaving one feeling exhausted relief when its finally over. War film buffs and Scott fans will turn out but general audiences and women in particular will approach with extreme caution. Of the war films that have come out since ""Saving Private Ryan"" ""Black Hawk Down"" most closely resembles ""Enemy at the Gates"" about the siege of Stalingrad in that both are cold accounts of remorseless urban warfare marked by constant sniping in abjectly squalid settings. The new films protracted detailing of door-by-door block-by-block fighting may also remind viewers of portions of ""Band of Brothers"" but that comparison only serves to underscore the present features shortcomings in that the epic HBO series was able to develop interesting characters in the service of dramatic involvement and tension elements conspicuously missing here. Straightening out the fragmented and time-jumping structure of Bowdens heavily researched book into a conventional chronological narrative script by first-time scenarist Ken Nolan and vet Steve Zaillian (""Schindlers List"") focuses tightly on the events of Oct. 3 1993 when members of the United States elite Delta Force and Rangers went into Mogadishu to ""extract"" two top associates of a dominant Somali warlord whose thuggery was making life even more miserable for the citizens of his country. Expository titles lay out the essential background in a dry concise manner that the U.S. was in the East African country as part of a larger United Nations peacekeeping mission; that the warlord Mohamed Farah Aidid slaughtered 24 Pakistani members of this multinational force and that Aidid was only furthering the suffering of a starving nation where 300000 people had already died by snaring relief packages for himself and killing others who attempted to collect them. With Aidid himself proving elusive and patience in Washington growing thin as the mission dragged on without results the Americans took advantage of a tip regarding a high-level Aidid clan-meeting to accomplish something concrete. As the film gets under way the young American soldiers stationed at an airbase just outside seaside Mogadishu are ready for some action. But one of the pictures best scenes undercuts any sense of rah-rah enthusiasm as a seen-it-all Somali businessman (George Harris) informs the American commanding officer Maj. Gen. William F. Garrison (Sam Shepard) ""I think you shouldnt have come here. This is civil war its our war."" However briefly the Somali view is represented and however much (the almost exclusively white) American lives may be ""valued"" over those of the (black) natives more than 500 of whom died in the firefight the film manages to pull off the remarkable tightrope walk of remaining scrupulously noncommittal in its attitude toward the conflict. Naturally it extols the highly trained American soldiers bravery loyalty and expertise but beyond that the film smartly abstains from gung-ho heroics patriotism or endorsement of policy. From one perspective this could be viewed as timid reluctance to express a point of view. In practice however the film is strictly interested in presenting the situation as it unfolded on the ground and in the air and its most impressive accomplishment lies in how it shows exactly what happened and then leaves it to every viewer to decide whether or not this sort of well-intentioned intervention and sacrifice is worth it. In this respect pic is unusually mature in that it doesnt tell you what to think. Unfortunately it also refrains from giving you anything to feel other than general revulsion for war. Token attempts are made to differentiate the Delta Force the aristocrats of U.S. military from the only somewhat less exalted Task Force Rangers but with their buzz cuts buff bods and similar ways of talking its not easy to tell the soldiers apart nor is one encouraged to think that its going to be worth the effort given how little attention Scott and the script give to the matter. Perhaps receiving marginally more screen time than most of the others is Staff Sgt. Matt Eversmann (Josh Hartnett) who is unexpectedly put in command of one of the ""chalks"" that will secure the area around the Mogadishu building being raided by the Deltas. Also standing out from the pack from time to time are Ranger Lt. Col. Danny McKnight (Tom Sizemore) a fearless older soldier who comes across as a more human version of Robert Duvalls Kilgore in ""Apocalypse Now;"" Delta Sgt. First Class Jeff Sanderson (William Fichtner) a resourceful pro; and Ranger Spec. Grimes (Ewan McGregor) a desk man who finally gets his shot at combat. After a half-hour of preliminaries Operation ""Irene"" begins and the sight of 19 helicopters buzzing over the desert beaches toward the bleached-white city in the afternoon sun is stunning to behold. The 160 men some of whom arrive on 12 Humvees and trucks expect to be in and out within an hour and indeed it takes only 20 minutes for the Deltas to land assault the building and take the two ""Tier One"" targets and numerous other prisoners. But then things begin to go wrong. One soldier is severely injured when he misses his descent rope and at 20-minute intervals two big Black Hawk helicopters are shot down by heavily armed street fighters. These disasters suddenly require the Rangers whose policy it is never to leave a man behind dead or alive to try to rescue their fallen comrades by making their way several blocks through the forbidding city where snipers move from roof to roof and gangs of angry locals can materialize from around any street corner. A solid hour consists of little but constant shooting and shouted dialogue making it tough to engage with characters you barely know. It may well have been Scotts aim to keep the men basically anonymous and interchangeable -- to further the point that this is what war is that it has always been thus and always will be. And while the specific historical setting of Mogadishu is stunningly evoked via an amazing blend of location shooting mostly in the city of Sale Morocco near Rabat and on production designer Arthur Maxs utterly realistic sets there is a simultaneous generalized feeling to the action that makes the film an expression of resignation over humankinds need to play out these fatal scenarios over and over. Perhaps at somewhat shorter length these points could have been made more effectively but the pummeling viewers get -- which can be rationalized intellectually as ""putting them through"" the firefight as vividly as possible -- makes the film more rewarding to think about afterward than to actually experience. Pic will have a decidedly limited pool of repeat viewers. Polish lenser Slawomir Idziaks images have a raw vital quality that heightens the urgent you-are-there quality of the action and all the equipment effects and military-related details are superb. Editor Pietro Scalia has made an enormous contribution both in keeping the vice screwed tight in individual sequences and in organizing the chaotic pieces into a coherent whole although one wishes that there had been a few cutaways to establish the disposition of the prisoners who disappear for very long periods. Hans Zimmers score effectively juggles numerous different modes from World Music sounds and choral work to source material.

"Shock Troops washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Shock Troops Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday January 18 2002 Dont turn to Ridley Scotts stunning ""Black Hawk Down"" for lectures on geopolitics the tarnished Clinton foreign-policy legacy or theories of terrorist conspiracy. The movie reflects not a public intellectuals view of the world but Sgt. ""Hoot"" Hootens. Hoots the guy with the M-16 who doesnt make decisions but only tries to survive them. The movie then may disappoint pundits and op-ed cowboys and all the men in gray suits and black shoes who so self-confidently throng this citys streets over the lunch hour. It teaches stuff they dont know only the smallest and most bitter of lessons that ammunition is more important than water that cover is more important than concealment and that the good die young. ""Black Hawk Down"" re-creates war at the micro level as experienced by Army Rangers and Delta Force commandos on the ground in Mogadishu Somalia Oct. 3 1993. On that day a routine if dangerous mission slated to last an hour fell apart in the worst possible way. The young soldiers found themselves the targets of what can only be described as a citywide homicidal rage in which every angry Somali with a Soviet-bloc assault rifle or a rocket-propelled grenade launcher petitioned his grievance in lead and warheads. The soldiers initially deployed to represent their countrys humanitarian instincts toward famine relief had by this time become policemen hunting a powerful warlord who usurped United Nations food supply efforts. Now they found themselves in a pitched battle. For 15 hours they sheltered in the ruins of the city scampered to consolidate rescue their wounded and collect their dead shot at everything that was shooting at them and prayed for deliverance. When it finally arrived early the next morning 18 Americans and an estimated 1000 Somalis were dead and the city had been turned into a warscape resembling Stalingrad. It was the worst single day of combat for American soldiers since the Vietnam War and even if the job the young men had been sent to do was accomplished that achievement - in the way these things always seem to go - turned out to be largely meaningless. You may be impelled to ask What was the point? But you probably wont have time while the film is onscreen. The movie doesnt moralize and its political meanings may be arrived at only by laborious inference. Its too intense to let the rational part of your brain gear up; instead you are simply there scurrying ducking wishing you had more ammunition luck or courage and wishing the whole thing would end. You come out shaking and weak. Shot in Morocco with an unusual amount of Pentagon cooperation ""Black Hawk Down"" re-creates the events of that day with the full technical resources of modern cinematic technique. It helps to have a few Black Hawk helicopters to play with of course and a 90 million budget a Pico Boulevard club-full of hot young actors and in the role of the Somali militia the Royal Moroccan Army. But its still possible to have all that and screw it up; Scott an experienced big-movie maker (""Gladiator"" for example wasnt too shabby in the size department) tries to keep the phony movie moments to a minimum and the sense of frantic professionalism to a maximum. It works. Task Force Rangers mission - to arrest two men said to be the warlords lieutenants in a building in a teeming market district - seemed to go well enough at the start. As planned the Delta commandos choppered in by small helicopters assaulted the building and ""extracted"" the men; the Rangers arriving minutes later in heavier Black Hawk helicopters fast-roped down and set up a perimeter. Meanwhile a lightly armored convoy headed through the city to rendezvous with them and take everybody back to base three miles away. But - spontaneously it seems - the citys militia rallied and began to bring fire on the hated Americans; the whole thing went south when one then another of the big Ranger helicopters were shot down and troops had to be diverted to the crash sites. Each one became an Alamo or a Little Round Top as the Americans took up defensive positions while rescue convoys attempted to reach them. So focused on the experience of the fighting is ""Black Hawk Down"" that it doesnt bother much with context or with character something that could never be said of reporter Mark Bowdens original book. Bowden took the time to explain not merely the politics involved but more important the culture of the new volunteer Army. Theres not a whiff of Vietnam-era sullenness and resentment; these arent draftees but volunteers in it for the fun travel and adventure. They aspire to be or are solid professionals; they dont see themselves as victims but as warriors. They are gung-ho Number One and RA (regular army) all the way. But they werent interchangeable; there were essentially two American military cultures on the streets of the Mog that day and while Scott evokes them visually he never explains them. The Rangers are shock infantry basically conventional in all military respects; their hair is trimmed or shaved their ranks low their ages young (most are in their first enlistment). An institutional vanity requires that they bark ""HOOOO-AGH"" in place of ""Yes sir"" or ""Yes Sergeant."" Most ""want action"" or joined to fight; theyre full of the bravado of a JV football team on its first road trip.

"Black Hawk Down | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; black-hawk-down ) Black Hawk Down (United States 2001) A movie review by James Berardinelli 1998s Saving Private Ryan introduced a new era of war movies. Gone are the bloodless tales of gallantry which portrayed the battlefield as a place where the fruits of bravery are victory. Replacing them are stories steeped in the gritty reality of combat - violent bloody horrific and chaotic. Images of severed arms fountaining blood and spilled intestines have replaced the sterile romanticized images of so many black-and-white war movies. For those who are not easily sickened by such visceral cinematic assaults films like Black Hawk Down can deliver a powerful indelible impact. In the years following Vietnam the United States military has kept a low profile (insofar as the profile of a superpowers strong arm can be termed ""low"") typically making its presence known (via television news) in ""sure-fire"" operations like the takeover of Grenada or the extraction of Noriega. More recently the stunning success of the campaign in Afghanistan has re-affirmed the American publics faith in the armed forces. But there have been failures - and one of the most glaring occurred on an October day in 1993. Only a few years after the triumph of the Gulf War the United States military machine was reminded that its perceived invulnerability was an example of self-delusion. The screenplay of Black Hawk Down written by Ken Nolan is based on the book by Mark Bowden. Bowden a staff reporter for the Philadelphia Inquirer first detailed the disastrous 1993 raid into Mogadishu in a serialized 29-part story that appeared in the paper during November and December of 1997. A year later the book which took the Inquirer series and expanded it appeared in stores around the world. The final product attracted the interest of two marquee Hollywood names - uber-producer Jerry Bruckheimer and producer/director Ridley Scott who was in search of something to follow-up Hannibal and Gladiator. The two paired up and Black Hawk Down got off the ground. This is not an easy film to sit through but it does what it sets out to do and brings the audience deep into the heart of combat. Its noisy messy and repetitious. There are probably more bullets and explosions than in any recent picture. Yet the illusion of ""being there"" is so real that at one point I involuntarily ducked my head to avoid being struck by something. Amazingly Scott manages to convey the chaos of the experience without losing the narrative. There is a story to be told here - one based largely on the accounts of the survivors - and it comes across clearly not muddled. Some have argued that not enough background is given but I would counter that the introductory crawl is sufficient to set the stage. Black Hawk Down is not an attempt to analyze what happened in Somalia - its concern is dramatizing 24 hours of hell that killed 18 United States servicemen and injured 70 others while racking up a Somalian body count that numbered in the hundreds. The movie is about combat not politics. Its about heroism and courage amidst unspeakable brutality. Black Hawk Down opens with a quote by Plato ""Only the dead have seen the end of war"". Then over a color-desaturated series of images we are presented with a brief history of why the United States was in Somalia in the early 90s. The story begins on October 2 1993. Characters are introduced - Major General William Garrison (Sam Shepard) who is in command of the U.S. military presence in the region; Staff Sergeant Matt Eversmann (Josh Hartnett) recently promoted to commanding a team; Company Clerk John Grimes (Ewan McGregor) who is about to exchange paperwork for a gun; Lt. Colonel Danny McKnight (Tom Sizemore) in charge of a segment of the ground troops; and Master Sergeant Paul Howe (William Fichtner) who will challenge orders if he thinks they are ill-advised. Together these men and many others are about to become involved in a seemingly routine mission that will go disastrously wrong. The objective is to capture several key advisors to Mohamed Farrah Aidid the warlord who controls Mogadishu. The United States wants Aidid out of the way and this seems to be the best opportunity to advance that goal. But the troops both on the ground and in the air encounter stiffer resistance than expected and this results in the downing of two black hawk helicopters. The ground troops then become divided as the raid turns into a rescue mission and in part because of poor planning and in part because of bad luck the fire fight turns into a debacle. Scotts movie is fast-paced and riveting. The film will keep the average viewer on the edge of his or her seat with eyes fixed on the screen. Cinematographer Slavomir Idziak (best known as a frequent collaborator of the late great Polish filmmaker Krzysztof Kieslowski) makes frequent effective use of filters to dampen hues and enhance the ""grittiness"" of Black Hawk Downs appearance. Hans Zimmers music is generally effective although there are times when it calls attention to itself a little too much. The performances are all effective because each of the actors knows how to downplay his part. Lead man Josh Hartnett appears far more comfortable in this role than he did as one of the romantic duelists in the overblown Pearl Harbor. Ewan McGregor temporarily turning in his lightsaber manages a reasonably convincing American accent as the films least likely hero. But the real stars of Black Hawk Down are character actors Tom Sizemore and William Fichtner both of whom create vivid personalities with limited screen time. Sizemore is no stranger to war movies having appeared in both Saving Private Ryan and Pearl Harbor. Fichtner is one of those guys whose name a lot of people wont recognize but whose face strikes an immediate chord of familiarity (the very definition of a ""character actor"") - he is perhaps best known for roles in Contact and Armageddon and like seemingly half of the cast he was also in Pearl Harbor. For Jerry Bruckheimer who is most easily recognized for his involvement in big-budget high-testosterone low-intelligence projects this is an opportunity to upgrade his image. (For the first time pundits are mentioning ""Bruckheimer"" and ""Oscar"" in the same sentence.) And at the moment Ridley Scott is riding the highest wave of his career. Critical plaudits for Black Hawk Down are as high as they were for Gladiator - and rightfully so. This is a singularly effective motion picture. Sure it could have had more character development and there are times when the gore verges on being gratuitously extreme (in particular during the ""operation"" to clamp an artery) but those are minor quibbles. On the whole Black Hawk Down is one hell of a ride. For better or for worse it will leave you stunned and reeling.

Grimes is played by Ewan McGregor in the Columbia Pictures/Revolution Studios Presentation Black Hawk Down. Photo HANDOUT Mission accomplished / Black Hawk Down a brutally effective depiction of Somali battle 1 / 3 Back to Gallery BLACK HAWK DOWN War action. Starring Josh Hartnett. Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. Directed by Ridley Scott. (R. At Bay Area theaters. 140 minutes.) The entire mission re-created so graphically in ""Black Hawk Down"" was supposed to take place in much less time than the two hours and 20 minutes it takes to watch this movie. The mission was doomed. This movie is not. It is an exceptional accomplishment -- and in certain ways that could not have been foreseen. I can think of no other instance when a country at war has presented on its movie theater screens such an excruciating account of battle or such a sobering one. The only proper response when this brutal and heartbreaking experience ends is thoughtful silence. The camera does not turn away from the gore. It is far more unrelenting than even ""Saving Private Ryan."" War stories that returning fighting men used to tell only in private about the horrors they have witnessed are here put up on the screen for all to see. ""Black Hawk Down"" deals with a U.S. Army assault by Black Hawk helicopters and Humvees on a building in the center of the East African city of Mogadishu Somalia on Oct. 3 1993. It was a ""snatch-and-grab"" operation by Army Rangers and Delta Force commandos to remove two key figures associated with a local warlord who was interfering with U.N. humanitarian efforts. The country dominated by Sunni Muslims was torn by famine and civil war and Mogadishu itself was divided into friendly and hostile camps. Sound familiar? Like Americans in the 70s who watched the dark Korean War-era comedy series ""MASH"" on television and read Vietnam into it we cannot help but see this 1993 excursion in light of whats happening today. NOT EXPLOITATIVE There is no need to praise this Jerry Bruckheimer production at the expense of his others designed as popular entertainments and thought by some to be overbearing from ""Con Air"" to the romanticized ""Pearl Harbor."" He does what he does. This time he and co-producer-director Ridley Scott (""Blade Runner"" through ""Gladiator"" to ""Hannibal"") have come through with something that still hits at gut level but far transcends exploitation. Josh Hartnett (""Pearl Harbor"") gets top billing. He plays the idealistic Staff Sgt. Eversmann who had never even shot at a man before but was put in charge of one of the Ranger invader groups. Ewan McGregor a long way from ""Moulin Rouge"" is an office-bound coffee-making soldier plucked at the last minute to replace a Ranger who has an epileptic seizure. More than a dozen other soldiers are introduced some so briefly that early on it appears the emotional connections might not come through and ""Black Hawk Down"" might become no more than a gory chess game. It is an unfounded concern and certainly not the case by Hartnetts beautifully delivered final scene. ""Black Hawk Down"" tells the story of regrouping and rescue after a failed mission. Scott lays out the logistics often with aerial shots placed at exactly the right moment in a pattern of rising tension confrontation and then disarray. Headquarters begins by relying on surveillance contact with an informant in an automobile who was supposed to stop in front of the target building. A sense of dread builds. Misperceptions occur from the start. Copter pilots who think a child is waving dont know he is actually a communications link for the enemy. The Black Hawks look incongruously like flying dolphins with their low- slung snouts. The crash sequences go beyond stunning craftsmanship. They evoke tragic pity and terror. The first copter does not go down in a street intersection until spinning crazily out of control. When a second one goes down the pilot (Ron Eldard) in shock continues describing whats happening in dispassionate terms. Things fall apart tempers erupt but the men desperately try to maintain military discipline of speech. Sam Shepard plays the field commander who watches everything unravel on aerial surveillance. The elite Rangers many of them in their late teens were bonded not only by their training but also by their clannish looks -- shaved heads that rise to a cap of bristles -- and private slang. They sign off with a ""who-ah."" 18-HOUR BATTLE The American invaders were supposed to be in and out of there in less than an hour and the men on the ground did not take night-vision equipment. But the battle of Mogadishu will stretch on for 18 hours and the green-screen overhead night views of confusion that Scott shows us are not like the sanitized ones released for CNN and MSNBC. Scott tells much of the story purely in visual terms. The dialogue is sparse but telling. ""Theyre shooting at us"" a soldier exclaims. ""Well shoot back"" says the old hand played by Tom Sizemore. On another occasion ""Wheres the rescue squad?"" ""Were it."" After the first Black Hawk goes down huge crowds of armed Mogadishu civilians go on the rampage. A point will come when the American forces lose the initiative. Truth is stranger than fiction but at least fiction is bearable. Elements of ""Black Hawk Down"" are almost too much to endure. A battlefield surgery is done without morphine. A severed hand is picked up from the ground. A fatally wounded soldier seems almost unaware he has been blasted in half. There are bizarre encounters between Americans and Somalis not all of them combatants and sometimes equally confused. But there is one Somali officer who tells a captured American ""Without victory there can be no peace. The killing will never stop. This is how things are in our world."" In ""Black Hawk Down"" rescue becomes a heroic substitute for victory. Advisory This film contains extreme violence and gore.

Black Hawk Down Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2002) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/black-hawk-down-2002,200,blackhawkdown12,blackhawkdown,rogerebert
"Black Hawk Down and Dirty washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids On Screen Black Hawk Down and Dirty Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer Friday January 18 2002 ""Black Hawk Down"" isnt just brutal for its multiple deaths and grisly woundings blood spritzing into the dusty African air. Or that shot of a severed hand lying absurdly on the ground. That last ones hard to forget. Ridley Scotts blood-and-guts opera is also a frontal assault on American confidence and that once-unshakable belief that what the world needs is our freedom our democracy and our Coca-Cola. But thats not all. This compelling account of the 1993 Battle of Mogadishu adapted from Mark Bowdens ""Black Hawk Down A Story of Modern War"" is about arrogance too. Its also a cautionary tale about the importance of military preparedness. Its about watching for scorpions underfoot. And packing infrared goggles and extra water before you climb into that helicopter. And hoping against hope youll get home alive even if your innards are hanging out. And wishing to God youd never set foot in Somalia. And theres still more to be drawn from Scotts chronicle of this 15-hour skirmish between U.S. elite forces (Army Rangers and Delta Force) and seemingly countless followers of the Somali warlord Mohamed Farah Aideed. The ancient truths for example That sense that death on the battlefield as all warriors know leads to the Elysian Fields Valhalla or Arlington National Cemetery. And perhaps theres this barely perceptible message (at sheepdog-whistle pitch) War is always thus. Know it. Take your place with the valiant and dead. Like others before you. And theres this too What were we thinking? Sent into Mogadishu Somalia in October 1993 as part of a United Nations peacekeeping operation the soldiers mission is to abduct two of Aideeds top lieutenants. Its supposed to be a good-guy endeavor. Aideed and his militia have been intercepting international food supplies causing thousands of Somalians - the foods intended recipients - to starve. Get the food to the hungry. Feed the world. Gentlemen start your Humvees. Almost immediately that higher purpose is dragged like Hectors body through the dirt. When two Black Hawk helicopters Super Six One and Super Six Four are brought down by Somalian gunfire Mogadishu becomes a military rescue operation. But when the troops sent to save the stranded flight crew become pinned down themselves that rescue turns into an all-points-bulletin Get out of Hell but bring every soldier with you dead or alive. Watch out for that shoulder-fired missile streaking toward you. The faces of the actors including Josh Hartnett (the closest to a central character in the movie) Sam Shepard Ewan McGregor Tom Sizemore and William Fichtner are almost indistinguishable from one another. Their hair is shorn jaws set helmets strapped. Theyre Army. As the movie spirals into tighter downward coils those faces become even more alike covered in blood dust and grime. Their eyes are wide with terror disbelief and confusion as they try to make sense of the commands and cross commands screaming into their walkie-talkies. As if part of some nightmarish video game the Somalians (nicknamed ""skinnies"") rush out from behind buildings or from shadowy doorways guns blazing. Occasionally they use women as shields. Sometimes there are three or four of them on a truck with mounted artillery performing some East African form of drive-by. And theres another one standing atop a construction site aiming his missile. Despite having the worlds greatest warmaking technology and best-trained fighters the Americans are powerless. At one point a badly wounded Lt. Col. Danny McKnight (Sizemore) is barreling through Mogadishu in a Humvee trying to get away from the deadly rain of bullets. His purpose is to get to the other end of town and rescue the downed flight crew. But hes dependent on overhead surveillance for directions. Hes driving too fast say the helicopter guides overhead. By the time directions are relayed down to him for any particular road or intersection he has already driven past it. Hes going to have to slow down. But if he does he spits into the radio hes dead. Everyone is losing and losing badly. And in Scotts hands this grand defeat is almost embarrassingly spectacular. Aesthetically youre in heaven thanks to Slawomir Idziaks exquisite cinematography Pietro Scalias stunning montage and Hans Zimmers pulsating score. Of course Scott is the orchestrator. When a soldier sees that hand for example the music stops. Theres a moment of silence. The soldier is having a reality shift. Then the music returns. And were back again. Back in hell. And youre drawn in like it or not. You cant get away from the immediacy. Or the feeling that youre getting sucked in too. At the beginning some of the flight crew - unaware of the bad day theyre about to have - are streaking over the Indian Ocean. The shark-infested Indian Ocean that is. Theyre like good old boys or California surfers whooping it up from above. Theyre young eager and yes arrogant. And theyre playing a song loud. Its Elvis. ""Were caught in a trap . . .

The light in which those pictures were made casts shadows too - the darn-clear stakes of World War II informed beacon-of-hope GI sagas in the 40s and 50s the damn-muddy jungles of Vietnam produced equally furious pictures in the 70s and 80s. And if every generation gets the ""Apocalypse Now"" - and ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" - it needs then the generation defined by 9/11/01 is seeing a very different Black Hawk Down from the one it might have seen on 9/10/01. I say this even though whats on the screen wasnt reedited after U.S. troops were sent to Afghanistan only released sooner than had been intended. Certainly those who troop to theaters for Ridley Scotts square- jawed gung-ho-istic combat saga about a real-life 1993 U.S. military mission gone horribly wrong in Somalia now watch this story about American soldiers fighting and dying in a land they may not understand with reformatted hearts and minds. But even an audience moved to tender patriotism might wonder how Scott a proven master of ""Gladiator""-size visual showmanship could have bombed away the personality of every man fighting until hes left with nothing more than pure combat. ""Black Hawk Down"" is driven by scenes of gripping unflinching battle touched by the directors talent for communicating through the colors he chooses even in the spray of mud on a wounded mans face. Its powered by extended stretches of pummeling adrenalized battle that are perhaps the stylistic contributions of Scotts Delta Force of a producing colleague Jerry Bruckheimer. But no one deserves censure even in conservative times for asking Who are these guys with guns? And for requesting more from a war drama than images of blood and guts. ""Black Hawk Down"" is based on Mark Bowdens intense newspaper reportage ultimately part of his best-selling book about the U.S. militarys single most costly firefight since Vietnam in which 18 Americans died. (In the course of the siege two Black Hawk helicopters were shot down.) Bowden had more space of course to explain who the Somali fighters were and why even women and children were willing to attack the stranded Americans. (More than 500 Somalians died by battles end.) But in all the 143 minutes of Scotts movie and Ken Nolans screenplay the black enemy remains virtually faceless. The handsome fighting Americans are white meanwhile but for the most part interchangeable themselves. Josh Hartnett Ewan McGregor Tom Sizemore Ron Eldard - they load their ammo they blast away. As a man each matters little in Scotts war; only as a man-shaped mass that shoots shouts and survives do they register. At a time when almost 2000 of The New York Times daily thumbnail profiles of the Sept. 11 dead have moved readers to tears over the months a little recognition of individual souls - Somali Afghan American - may be what a war movie needs most to win.

But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

USATODAY.com - Black Hawk turns nightmare into great cinema Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 12/28/2001 - Updated 0911 AM ET Black Hawk turns nightmare into great cinema By Mike Clark USA TODAY Black Hawk Down (out of four) Stars Josh Hartnett Ewan McGregor Tom Sizemore Sam Shepard William Fichtner Director Ridley Scott Distributor Columbia Pictures Rating R for intense realistic and graphic war violence and language By focusing without distraction on the mission at hand Black Hawk Down breaks out of the pack in Hollywoods long history of combat movies. It does so in ironic screen timing by reminding us of a battle that turned many against American troop commitment. Ridley Scotts likely Oscar nominee adapted from Mark Bowdens same-name book extols the sheer professionalism of Americas elite Delta Force -- even in the unforeseen disaster that was 1993s Battle of Mogadishu. In relating the conflict in which 18 Americans died and 70-plus were injured the standard getting-to-know-you war-film characterizations are downplayed. While some may regard this as a shortcoming it is in fact a virtue given the nuts-and-bolts movie Gladiator/Hannibal director Scott and company have elected to make. If ever there were a story in which logistics should dominate this is it -- and besides smart casting fills in the personality gaps. Its clear the movie is going to have all the human element it needs when we see that commanding Gen. William F. Garrison is played by Sam Shepard who could have been a superstar in Hollywoods golden age of screen heroes. The midtown U.N. peacekeeping mission intended to capture two lieutenants of Somali warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid was billed as maybe an hours assignment. Following debacles that afflicted both air and ground forces the ensuing firefights escalated that time frame 15-fold. The movie runs an uncommonly intense and fast-moving 144 minutes with the final 100 devoted exclusively to what happened when bad luck confusion and technological limitations converged. No war movie I have ever seen so vividly shows battle from differing perspectives combatants on the ground and on rooftops; others hundreds of feet above them under whirling blades; and officers in protected areas watching the debacle on video monitors trying to figure out what to do. Plunked in the middle of all this are donkeys cats and even childrens swing sets as if what is happening isnt surreal enough. Black Hawks knockout photography editing and sound are all state of the art while the ensemble performers (Tom Sizemore Josh Hartnett Ewan McGregor William Fichtner) in contrast are effectively subordinate to the material. Were not used to Jerry Bruckheimer movies released late in the year for awards consideration but the producer of Armageddon and Pearl Harbor has gotten the last laugh on his many detractors with a solemn achievement. Scott too has finally directed a movie as memorable as the ones that established his reputation Alien Blade Runner and Thelma amp; Louise.

Producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Ridley Scott have pooled their always-questionable cinematic tastes to bring us ""Black Hawk Down"" a war movie that pound for pound is one of the most violent films ever released by a major studio (Columbia Pictures in case youre keeping score). However unequalled slaughter is only one element of this films considerable insult. The most distasteful part is that its being presented as an unflinching tribute to fallen heroes rather than the realistically rendered game of ""Doom"" that it is. Forget the American military this is more an homage to the visceral thrill of exploding arms heads and legs.
