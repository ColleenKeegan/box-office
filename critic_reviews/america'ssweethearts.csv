Clowes gets loneliness down on paper the way Degas once did on canvas. In the painters cafe portrait Absinthe a woman in a wilted hat sits at a table with a glass of puke-colored liquid. Its an unforgettable image of aloneness that takes you beyond the table beyond the cafe even beyond the museum and makes you think about those moments when you too drunk or stone-sober have been alone in the world. The thing is its all incredibly beautiful -- the stupid hat the foul drink the sour downward curve of the womans mouth -- and its the fact that beauty can live in such ugliness in despair that gives the painting its larger truth. Theres that same ache and beauty in Clowes work and remarkably given that this is his first try at fiction director Terry Zwigoff has managed to capture it in his film. Best known for his documentary about cartoonist Robert Crumb Zwigoff pulls off something in Ghost World that seems a minor miracle -- he creates someone with a complex inner life. That may not surprise anyone whos seen Crumb a prickly film about a prickly subject but its a relief at a time when action and gleaming surfaces count more than the murk and mystery of being. The lack of good characters and decent writing is a familiar enough complaint about the movies but whats really gone missing is a sense that anyone has an internal world a yearning searching consciousness. Enid and Rebecca (Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson) the teenagers at the center of the film arent just searching -- theyre stabbing away at the world with the inchoate touching fury of children choking on their own rage and tears. Just graduated from high school the girls are too smart to fit in but not so smart that they understand why it hurts when they dont; surly and caustic they cling to each other as if to life preservers. And while Zwigoff who wrote the screenplay with Clowes clearly doesnt want them to drown he has the integrity to know better than to just bail them out. Its early summer and the girls are facing the rest of their lives. Enid dark in coloring and mood soft in shape but brittle-hard is one of those adolescent curmudgeons with a ""Do Not Disturb"" sign tattooed on her soul. Rebecca a willowy question mark is Enids Eve Arden -- blond with a dry wit and an infinite sympathy for her friend. As with so many stories about girls Ghost World begins with a suggestion of unrequited love then drifts into something else as the pair separate. Rebecca wants them to get their own apartment but Enid cant face leaving the refuge of her bedroom not because she doesnt want to grow up but because the world out there -- the 9-to-5 married-with-children low-cholesterol mortgaged franchised rationalized sublimated world -- is a horror. So Enid burrows deeper inside and after a fashion begins to find herself both in her art (shes a cartoonist) and in a friendship with Seymour a collector of old-time ephemera and a terminal outsider who as played by Steve Buscemi is a riff on Crumb himself from his forlorn old-man clothes and posture to his jazz 78s and delight in tumescent women. Zwigoff never tells us if Enid ever leaves her room and we never do find out what the title Ghost World actually means only that its something melancholic and a little heartbreaking. Enid and Rebecca may be living in a ghost world or they themselves may be ghosts perhaps both. You cant even tell what it is theyre haunting a town or a suburb since their external reality is indistinguishable from thousands of other anonymous zones across the country. The girls find oases in a local cafe in a retro diner called Wowsville in a zine store patronized by slouchy young men with the pasty distracted look of serial masturbators. Mostly though they live in a world of their own making. As in Clowes cartoon not a lot happens to them and it doesnt matter -- theres a yard sale an art show some wistful sexual flailing. If Zwigoff doesnt always make his movie move (hes overly faithful to the concept of the cartoon panel) he has a gift for connecting us to people who arent obviously likable then making us see the urgency of that connection. When Enid lies in her bedroom listening to the blues putting down the needle on ""Devil Got My Woman"" again and again and floating into the ether its a measure of this films gentle power that we dont want to leave her room either.

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm The most interesting thing about the new romantic comedy Americas Sweethearts is that the very individual whos likely most responsible for getting it made in the first place -- director and studio head Joe Roth -- is also the least important part of the final product. The film is so anonymous so corporately conceived and executed that the director is incidental. What matters here are the big stars the little guys who ran the cameras and did the sound and if only because of his genuinely oddball delivery as a lisping Spanish lover named Hector Hank Azaria. Less memorable are Catherine Zeta-Jones and John Cusack as Gwen and Eddie a movie-star couple on the marital outs forced together by the studio thats set to release their latest feature. The two stars look pretty good and move through the scenery like professionals as does Julia Roberts who as Gwens long-suffering doormat sister Kiki proves her worth as Time magazines recently anointed ""best movie star"" in America by pretending to play second banana to Zeta-Jones. Billy Crystal who plays the publicist masterminding a press junket thats meant to launch the new Gwen and Eddie movie wrote the screenplay with Peter Tolan. The script is studded with bits of amusing shtick but as with those long Academy Awards nights theres far too much dead time in between the jokes. (The best stuff is a tantalizing glimpse of Zeta-Jones tap-dancing alongside Christopher Walken -- its the only moment in the film that doesnt feel canned.) Devoid of an authorial voice or a semblance of individual style Americas Sweethearts is a run-of-the-mill compilation of throwaway laugh lines strained caricature movie-star allure and perfectly fine craft and none of it would be worth bothering about if the movie wasnt also smug about its own mediocrity. But theres the rub. The film isnt just banal its aggressively arrogantly banal. Its awash in a miasma of Philistinism which is why its entirely predictable that the character of an eccentric director (Walken) would inspire Crystal and Tolan to take potshots at Godard and Kubrick. Still youd think that Roth --whos supposed to be the smart one the guy who gets it -- would have had better sense especially since his films under-30 demographic probably doesnt know who these geezers are. Then again maybe Roth actually believes that all these actors signed up to work for him because they saw through his power right to his irrepressible thirsting talent.GHOST WORLD | Directed by TERRY ZWIGOFF | Written by ZWIGOFF and DANIEL CLOWES | Based on the graphic novel by CLOWES Produced by LIANNE HALFON JOHN MALKOVICH and RUSSELL SMITH Released by United Artists | At Sunset 5 and Westside PavilionAMERICAS SWEETHEARTS | Directed by JOE ROTH Written by BILLY CRYSTAL and PETER TOLAN | Produced by SUSAN ARNOLD DONNA ARKOFF ROTH and CRYSTAL Released by Columbia Pictures | Citywide Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

Unfortunately former Disney head Joe Roth (who last directed ""Revenge of the Nerds 2"" and ""Coupe de Ville"") is at the helm proving how easily screwball can get all screwed up. Crystal (who produced co-wrote and co-stars) plays Lee a veteran movie publicist who must orchestrate the movie junket from hell Eccentric director Hal Weidmann (Christopher Walken having a ball) has snatched the only print of his latest film which stars feuding movie-star spouses Eddie (John Cusack) and Gwen (Catherine Zeta-Jones). Lee asks Kiki (Julia Roberts) Gwens mousy sister/assistant to facilitate an Eddie/Gwen reunion to distract the media -- complicated by the presence of Gwens current lover (Hank Azaria). Kiki whos long carried a torch for Eddie agrees. See an ending coming? ""Americas Sweethearts"" 1/2 With Julia Roberts Billy Crystal Catherine Zeta-Jones John Cusack. Directed by Joe Roth from a screenplay by Crystal and Peter Tolan. 100 minutes. Rated PG-13 for language and some crude and sexual humor. Various theaters. The problem here isnt the material; its a perfectly fine setup for romantic-comedy capering with enough good one-liners to satisfy. But Roth seems a bit at sea with his powerhouse cast. Funny characterizations abound but the pace is uneven the chemistry feels off -- we cant imagine Eddie and Gwen ever having been together -- and some performances are so broad (particularly Azaria who seems to be playing a heterosexual version of his character from ""The Birdcage"") that they seem to belong in another movie. Also the film (shot in a rush to make its release date) looks terrible -- flat poorly lighted faces; muddy coloring; awkward camera work. The press kit notes that the filmmakers ""didnt want the lighting to be overly glamorous"" -- well they certainly succeeded. But this is a movie-star-glamour kind of movie guys -- why is Zeta-Jones looking waxy and tired and Roberts pale and washed-out even when she emerges from her frumpy cocoon? So its all kind of a mess but time passes fairly pleasantly. The always scary Zeta-Jones charges through the film with a shoulder-swinging walk and a funny mixture of imperiousness and petulance. (""Did we brush my teeth?"" she whines to an assistant.) Cusack brings laconic charm to his understated role. Roberts in cat-eye glasses and a fanny pack does her usual nice-girl vulnerability thing which works just fine. And Crystal fluttering between them like a bearded moth shows his usual crackerjack comic timing. Fine supporting work comes from Walken as the gonzo director Alan Arkin as Eddies leaf-sniffing ""wellness guide"" and Stanley Tucci as a devious studio head. All are a pleasure to watch -- and all deserve better treatment. Moira Macdonald can be reached at 206-464-2725 or mmacdonaldseattletimes.com.

Julia Roberts is Zeta-Jones sister and personal assistant a doormat who comes into her own after bedding Cusack. Sweet nothing / Julia Roberts latest romantic comedy is as empty as the movie industry it portrays 1 / 2 Back to Gallery AMERICAS SWEETHEARTS Romantic comedy. Starring Julia Roberts Billy Crystal Catherine Zeta-Jones and John Cusack. Directed by Joe Roth. Written by Billy Crystal and Peter Tolan. (PG-13. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Julia Roberts should be reason enough to see any romantic comedy -- her batting average is peerless -- but in her latest efforts ""The Mexican"" and the just-opened ""Americas Sweethearts"" the Golden Girls luck seems to be running thin. A slice of overpackaged overslick twaddle ""Americas Sweethearts"" offers an insiders look at movie-star egos press-agent chicanery and an easily duped press corps. It takes place at a press junket where actors are brought together with reporters for a volley of interviews and it stars Roberts as Kiki Harrison the personal assistant and sister to movie diva Gwen Harrison (Catherine Zeta-Jones). Gwen spoiled and narcissistic is separated from Eddie Thomas (John Cusack) her husband and frequent co-star. Gwen is loath to spend time with Eddie but agrees to one final appearance in order to promote their last movie. Thats where Kiki comes in Without her gentle interference press agent Lee Phillips (Billy Crystal) hasnt a prayer of making this junket work. ""Sweethearts"" was directed by Joe Roth the former head of 20th Century Fox and Disney whose new company Revolution Studios produced the film. It was written by Crystal whos obviously attended his share of junkets and is predicated on the assumption that viewers will be just as amused by movie- industry machinations as the people who experience them firsthand. Theres arrogance in that assumption but thats not reason enough to dislike this movie. Whats offensive about ""Americas Sweethearts"" is that it doesnt contain a single genuine emotion. Its just as bogus and hollow as the movie business it portrays. Romantic comedies are supposed to engage our sympathy make us care about the characters and root for their happiness. ""Americas Sweethearts"" presents two monsters (Zeta-Jones and Crystal) one flake (Cusack) and one doormat (Roberts) and then expects us to be feel soft and cozy when the doormat beds the flake (who after all is her sisters husband). Suddenly after years of fetching and groveling Kiki realizes that shes been used and metamorphoses into a feisty rebel. Such are the benefits of shagging a family member What was cloudy for decades becomes brilliantly clear. (Im not giving away anything here -- its all revealed in the movies trailer.) This kind of material works well in farce where everything is played broadly and couched in absurdity but ""Americas Sweethearts"" doesnt do that. It wants us to applaud Roberts and Cusacks creepy love match and tries to melt any resistance we might feel by underscoring their pillow talk with tinkly piano music. Crystals script co-written with Peter Tolan (""Analyze This"") not only stretches our credibility but also falls back on adolescent humor for cheap laughs. Maybe I see too many movies but it seems as if masturbation and small- penis jokes are so ordinary now like the f-word that theyve lost their power to shock or amuse. Theyre silly and dull -- proof of a screenwriters lack of imagination. Roberts is a radiant comic performer but ""Sweethearts"" is an ensemble piece that upsets our expectations by giving her a supporting role and placing the primary focus on Zeta-Jones. It also casts her as a frump -- in flashbacks shes camouflaged by a fat suit -- and the result is curious but flat. This is the downside of Roberts giant success and her dazzling ability to charm Every time she goes plain as she did in the little-seen ""Mary Reilly"" and ""Michael Collins"" our princess simply fizzles. Advisory This movie contains raunchy humor and sexual situations.

"CNN.com - Review Sweethearts generic from get-go - July 20 2001 MAIN PAGE WORLD U.S. WEATHER BUSINESS SPORTS POLITICS LAW SCI-TECH SPACE HEALTH ENTERTAINMENT TRAVEL EDUCATION IN-DEPTH QUICK NEWS LOCAL COMMUNITY MULTIMEDIA E-MAIL SERVICES CNNtoGO ABOUT US CNN TV whats on show transcripts CNN Headline News CNN International askCNN EDITIONS CNN.com Asia CNN.com Europe set your edition Languages --------- Time Inc. --------- Time.com People Fortune EW Review Sweethearts generic from get-go By Paul TataraCNN Reviewer (CNN) -- Its been hypothesized that modern movies are so poorly constructed because the people who run todays studios have no hands-on screenwriting or directorial experience. ""Americas Sweethearts"" a film industry satire starring John Cusack Catherine Zeta-Jones Julia Roberts and Billy Crystal remedies that situation -- to a degree. Joe Roth who directed the movie is also the head of Revolution Studios the brand new company that financed it. Unfortunately Roth directs the way a film executive thinks. He relies on mega-watt movie star charm to smooth over a stringently so-so script. VIDEO Actress Julia Roberts discusses her character in Americas Sweethearts with CNNs Bill Tush (July 19) Play video (QuickTime Real or Windows Media) Julia Roberts and John Cusack star in ""Americas Sweethearts"" (July 16) Play video (QuickTime Real or Windows Media) MORE STORIES Sour on Americas Sweethearts EXTRA INFORMATION  Sweetheart Julia Roberts  Julia Roberts profile A box-office queen hits her stride This is actually Roths second directorial effort. The first is a forgettable 1990 Daniel Stern comedy called ""Coupe de Ville."" Like its predecessor ""Americas Sweethearts"" is generic from the get-go. It only rises above the commonplace when Roberts and Cusack share the screen. But even then theres a monotony to the scenes a sense that youve seen it all before and will probably be seeing it again before the movies over. Roberts is Kiki Harrison the put-upon personal assistant to Gwen Harrison (Zeta-Jones) a beautiful spoiled movie star who also happens to be Kikis sister. Gwen and her actor husband Eddie Thomas (Cusack) are a wildly popular screen duo but theyre going through a difficult break-up. Gwen has unceremoniously dumped Eddie and latched onto their thick-tongued Spanish co-star Hector (Hank Azaria.) Eddie who seems like a decent enough guy is thrown into a tailspin by the sudden collapse of his marriage. As the story opens hes in a New Age mental health clinic receiving self-help instructions from a nonsense-spewing therapist (Alan Arkin in an amusing cameo.) Meanwhile back in Los Angeles Lee Phillips (Billy Crystal who co-wrote the script with Peter Tolan) the couples publicist has been recruited by a panicked studio head (Stanley Tucci) to throw up a smoke screen at an upcoming press junket. Gwen and Eddies latest film is being held hostage by its radical hippie director (Christopher Walken in another funny cameo.) He refuses to show it to anyone until its unveiled for the gathered press. That means scores of TV reporters will be holed up for a long weekend waiting for the film to arrive. Theyll have nothing to do but interview Gwen and Eddie which will almost certainly reveal a nasty vibe. Lees job is to make sure the two stars seem like theyre still good friends despite their very public falling out. Once the junket gets underway at a secluded hotel it becomes obvious that Kiki (whos recently lost 60 pounds and discovered her inner-Julia Roberts) is smitten with poor freaked-out Eddie. Though Kiki spends her day making sure Gwen is continuously pampered and mollified she prays that Eddie will see her sister for the self-serving bitch that she is. Why Eddie hasnt already gotten his fill of Gwen is one of the movies great mysteries. A lot has been made of Roberts turning down the larger role in favor of gentle loving Kiki but its basically a no-brainer. Zeta-Jones spends the entire picture in a whimpering huff taking advantage of everyone around her. Shes so consistently unpleasant you half wish that Eddies fantasy of shooting Gwen full of holes would come true and end the story on a high note. The script is full of half-considered character stances. Crystals Lee is a mess of contradictions. One minute hes covering up Gwen and Eddies shattered relationship then hes leaking it -- in excessively embarrassing ways -- to the national media. Its all he says in the name of free publicity even though its been established that the last thing the film hes promoting needs is that kind of exposure. Tucci also vacillates between hiding his stars personal problems and growing giddy with excitement when theyre uncovered. You get the feeling Roth was shooting for a sort of screwball comedy breathlessness in the latter part of the film but he hasnt got the rhythm to pull it off. Azaria shows up at the hotel spitting out dialogue in nearly unintelligible broken English and diving for Eddies throat. All hell is supposed to be breaking loose from there on out but its nowhere near as hellish as thinking that a nice guy like Eddie is actually trying to win back such a conniving unlikable manipulator. Crystal is a brilliant live performer and a fine comic actor. But ""My Giant"" ""Forget Paris"" ""City Slickers II"" ""Mr. Saturday Night"" and ""Memories of Me"" should be enough proof that hes only a mediocre a screenwriter. Team him up with a film executive whos not much of a director and the end result is an especially rickety romantic comedy. Even Americas real-life sweethearts cant save it. ""Americas Sweethearts"" contains a bit of profanity of course and one ineffective sight gag hinging on masturbation. Whatever you do dont expect a film-world skewering as sharp as ""The Player"" or ""Barton Fink."" ""Americas Sweethearts"" opens nationwide on Friday July 20 and is rated ""PG-13.""

"USATODAY.com - Youll love Julia but Sweethearts is merely likeable Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 07/19/2001 - Updated 0227 PM ET Youll love Julia but Sweethearts is merely likeable By Susan Wloszczyna USA TODAY Americas Sweethearts (out of four) Stars Julia Roberts Billy Crystal Catherine Zeta-Jones John Cusack Director Joe Roth Distributor Columbia Pictures Rating PG-13 for language some crude and sexual humor ""Life is a cookie"" pronounces Alan Arkins wellness guru near the start of the underachieving romantic comedy Americas Sweethearts. Let us take that deep thought a step further and say this movie is a cookie. A slightly stale generic-brand cookie. Too often it crumbles especially given the powerhouse talent (Julia Roberts Catherine Zeta-Jones Billy Crystal John Cusack) striving to keep this screwball confection from falling apart. Read more Video Americas Sweethearts trailer Photo Galleries Julia Roberts Runaway startlet John Cusack on film They succeed for a while because the premise concocted by Crystal and his Analyze This partner Peter Tolan is such a nibble-licious goody laced with Hollywood acid. A kook of a genius director (Christopher Walken) holds hostage the film thats the final teaming of split-up couple Gwen and Eddie (Zeta-Jones Cusack). And the studio panics. As schmoozy press agent Lee Crystal must fool the media into thinking the bickering pair have reconciled. He gets an assist from Roberts who plays Kiki Gwens personal slave and sibling. (Shes a frump but a darn sight prettier than that dreadful Mary Reilly.) That way reporters might not notice that the film is MIA during a junket at a desert resort isolated -- ""like the one in The Shining"" Lee specifies -- so they cant leave. Ex-Disney exec and production company honcho Joe Roth who hasnt directed in 11 years is somewhat out of practice and out of touch. Sophistication eludes him. Why the need to bonk Seth Green otherwise fine as Crystals clueless toady on the head with a flying golf ball? Where outside a Bugs Bunny cartoon does one hear birdy tweets after a character is smashed in the face with a tray? The spare insider info in this showbiz satire can be summed up this way Reporters ask stupid questions and even stupider stars sometimes answer them. On the plus side Stanley Tucci is frighteningly good as the type of heartless studio chief who considers suicide the ultimate PR opportunity. Crystal hogs most of the good lines and why not? His delivery is as reliable as Fed Ex. At least he unselfishly tosses a few choice morsels Cusacks way. Asked why he doesnt have an entourage Eddie whose psyche has been shredded by Gwens two-timing with a Spanish stud (Hank Azaria with an accent so broad that ""junket"" comes out as ""honket"") explains ""Im a paranoid schizophrenic. I am my own entourage."" Stunning as always an icy Zeta-Jones either shrieks ""Kiki"" or ""Me me."" At least her brief tap-dance routine during the otherwise mirthless movie-within-a-movie finale proves she would be dynamite in a film version of Chicago. But the main reason anyone is going to see this forced farce is Roberts whos on the sidelines pining for her brother-in-law. Youll see her encased in a fat suit in flashbacks. Youll see her binge on breakfast starch like no ones business. Youll see her once again be a Cinderella who gets her prince. Too bad shes sandwiched in a cookie thats half-baked.

More topical about Hollywood celebrity culture than it ever intended -- and perhaps a bit discomfiting right now for its uber-celebrity leading lady -- ""Americas Sweethearts"" begins as a smartly promising gently farcical comedy of manners and ends as sourly and haphazardly as the lives it is poking fun at. Repping the return of former Disney chief and current Revolution Studios head Joe Roth to a perch he occupied a decade ago behind the camera pic is the ultimate in contemporary Hollywood self-awareness and to its detriment self-ridicule even as it assembles the kind of cast perhaps only a studio topper could manage. While the premise of a studio-contrived reconciliation of the towns biggest star couple (separated after being married to each other) in order to promote their latest co-starring vehicle is redolent with potential this showbiz affair first gracefully and then desperately tries to revive parts of various classic Hollywood comedy traditions from Preston Sturges on-the-road character adventures to Ernst Lubitschs elegant wars between the sexes to Elaine Mays brand of moxie. The list of influences offers only a sense of how far pic is positioned from the nearest gross-out comedy barf bag and though toplining Julia Roberts ensures a fine opening tally the emphatically mature (though never salacious) tone and style plus uninspiring word of mouth will dampen B.O. for the sort of in-crowd Hollywood comedy the public has never embraced. The project is best seen as the work of Billy Crystals various skills as the writer of neurotics on the edge; as the actor who ensures that he both plays the slightly straight man and gets many of the choicest lines; and as the producer who can bring together the talent like his best nights as the Oscar show emcee. Crystal has almost become synonymous with Hollywood its Borscht Belt roots and its knack for needling itself in some kind of endless charity-sponsored roast. But this is also why Crystals latest (co-written with comedy vet and ""Analyze This"" partner Peter Tolan who has skewered TV as a main scribe for ""The Larry Sanders Show"") is a comic dead-end of navel-gazing infuriatingly shallow characters and uneven set pieces that range from the fresh to the ludicrous. Undoubtedly several thousand folks from Burbank to Malibu will be fascinated and tickled by this movie about movie egos and sellers but most of them will ponder by the time the third act plays out what went wrong. Storybook opener graphically designed in the mode of 30s and 40s romances sums up the vivid Liz n Dick-like joint career of Gwen Harrison (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Eddie Thomas (John Cusack) stars of movies that look even worse than several Taylor-Burton ventures and hardly have the whiff of verisimilitude. Top PR flack Lee Phillips (Crystal) has been canned by insecure studio boss Dave Kingman (Stanley Tucci) and told to hand over the reins to young Danny Wax (Seth Green). Dave though has a huge problem and he desperately needs the expertise of Lee -- who has promoted Gwens and Eddies last six pictures -- to solve it Their latest 86 million biggie a sci-fi time-travel epic titled ""Time Over Time"" is being held under apparent lock and key by the movies hairy unkempt half-maniacal helmer Hal Weidmann (Christopher Walken). Hals in final edit in the same cabin once occupied by Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski and wont screen it until the press junket. Even worse Gwen whos taken up with swaggering Spaniard Hector (Hank Azaria) isnt talking to Eddie after his apparent attempt on her life with his motorcycle. In pics surest capture of the mindgames and wheedling that transpire on a backlot Dave lures Lee in with the promise of his job back if he gets the stars together for the junket weekend. While Lee kicks into promo gear devising a remote Nevada desert resort locale to keep the press in tow until the mystery film arrives he tries to gently coddle Gwen toward the idea of reuniting with Eddie for the junket. The flacks real ally is Gwens sister and personal assistant Kiki (Roberts). Lee also must handle withering Eddie who doesnt look helped by a retreat at a ""wellness"" center run by his ""guide"" (played by Alan Arkin as a mix of Deepak Chopra and J. Krishnamurti). Eddies release from the retreat is negotiated by Lee and through this establishing section theres the feeling of a strong comedy of observed behavior taking shape. Once action leaves L.A. strength gives way to a bothersome weak string of situations such as Eddie trying to catch a peek of Gwen at night at the resort falling into cacti and being caught on security cameras in a badly compromised position. Nonsense and seriously under-crafted farce begin to reign supreme except for one promising development Kiki who even with the glowing Roberts playing her has gotten lost in this busy shuffle catches Eddies eye and renews a spark he first felt when Gwen had split and Kiki was 60 pounds heavier. (Roberts in fattening makeup is the very picture of subdued screwball comedy.) After a night in the sack though Eddie runs to Gwen when she needs him -- and the dawning recognition in Roberts eyes is not only the movies most human moment but the promise of great things to come. Sadly after a fine knockabout scene where Kiki finally gets to vent years of frustration to both big-headed empty-hearted stars a comic train wreck occurs in the form of awkward rooftop hijinks with Cusack and Crystal and especially with a monumentally unfunny climax where Walkens Hal -- made up to resemble in pics most bizarre touch the late director Hal Ashby -- arrives and presents the finished movie. Beyond the problem of the comedys promise failing to deliver is the storys muddy sense of whose tale its telling. While its wonderful to see stars operating in ensemble form it is also more than curious that Roberts character though finally arising as the central concern is kept under wraps for so long. The result isnt the case of clever narrative and theatrical trickery though but of indecision about who to turn to next and even why since Crystals Lee establishes such a canny witty hero from the opening sequences. Industry observers will surely pick apart ""Sweethearts "" errors in accurately observing Hollywood life and business for even granting farces license for exaggeration the errors are legion Hal would have to be the new Stanley Kubrick (whom he indeed cites at one point) in order to keep the film from the studio; Danny is obviously unqualified to assume a studios top PR post; Eddie would also have his own personal assistant clever explanatory jokes notwithstanding; mega-stars like these even ones who get along almost never sit side by side for on-camera junket interviews; and on and on. Taking the anti-star pose to the limit Roberts visibly has the most fun in the cast with a role that positions her in a way to observe stardom itself and she pulls it off with comic elan. Even though his writer side whittles down his own role Crystal is in ideal mode as the backroom arranger dealer and soother of frayed nerves. Zeta-Jones moves through the movie like a well-coifed ice queen and as such shes far too remote to care about for an instant while Cusacks Eddie is himself in too much of an identity fog to ever get to know well. Tucci and Azaria skillfully steal scenes and then exit but Walken is badly mishandled. Roth shows no signs of rust in his 10-year directing layoff and his steady almost waltzlike pacing is a welcome respite from insanely driven comedies. Production values are first class capped by Phedon Papamichaels glistening lensing and designer Garreth Stovers elegant dressing of main locale Hyatt Regency on Lake Las Vegas. James Newton Howard contributes one of his rare subdued underscores. In a sign of more shameless promotion several TV entertainment interviewers including Byron Allen and Sam Rubin appear in cameos.
