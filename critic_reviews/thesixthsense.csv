Though he is hardly a discovery the 11-year-old Osment is a revelation in The Sixth Sense an unnerving and astonishing thriller written and directed by Philadelphia native M. Night Shyamalan and entirely shot here.While the film about a troubled boy tormented by visions and by schoolmates stars Bruce Willis as a child psychologist The Sixth Sense rests squarely on Osments hunched little shoulders.He carries the movie a lyrical and eerie meditation upon loss and hurt and healing like Atlas swatting away ghosts with his free hand. So transparent is Osment as an actor and so rare that the pain on his face stabs you in the heart.Cole Sear (Osment) age 8 is a child of divorce. So Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Willis) initially figures that Cole is punishing himself for his fathers abandonment of the family.But the more Crowe observes the profoundly disturbed boy who wont admit much except that he sees dead people the more the doctor figures it was Coles possessed behavior that caused his father to bolt.Fortunately Cole has a loving and committed mom (Australian actress Toni Collette is excellent as the thorny rose of South Philly) who wants him to talk about the unspeakable horrors that rattle him and shatter the windows.Though Cole is too frightened to comply his mother and his doctor are the only people in whom he confides. He has no friends for his schoolmates think him a freak and treat him no better than his spectral tormentors. (Since they are far scarier unseen the ghosts make only an occasional appearance.)Shyamalan whose previous film Wide Awake likewise dealt with a youth facing loss has an extraordinary gift both as a screenwriter and a filmmaker in evoking how the world looks and feels to those four feet high.The looming figures of grown-ups sounds that are exaggerated because they are unfamiliar the gut-roiling fear that the things that scare you scare adults even more are so keenly observed here that the normal is more frightening than the paranormal.No surprise that a film carrying such a title works powerfully on the five senses. Although the film is saddled with a score by James Newton Howard who is to movie music what the pacifier is to infants much of the anxiety induced by The Sixth Sense is achieved through sound. Is that rustle the sound of a vultures wings or of an angels?As photographed by Tak Fujimoto the autumnal city is windswept by forces other than the chilly gusts of October. Rowhouses in Society Hill and South Philadelphia are mined for their historic (and potentially ghostly) echoes rather than merely for the warmth of their red-brick facades.The delicacy with which Fujimoto captures the textures of a bedspread that makes an improvised tent in a childs room or the architectural detail on a cornice gives the film a palpable sense of place rather than the digitized unreality of The Haunting.Willis? Hes unusually quiet and modulated in this movie the catalyst of change but not the essence of the story. In this regard hes not unlike the Judd Hirsch figure in Ordinary People a psychologist who is there more to listen than to talk.Of the many themes this resonant film echoes with most profound is that a seeming curse can be a gift if you arent afraid of it.Finally Coles hypersensitivity to the dead is much like the average childs hypersensitivity to life. Maybe the dead are just like the living Theyll hurt you if you let them but if you help them theyre likely to befriend you.This theme might get obscured by the films startling ending about which nothing more should be said. Go see it.THE SIXTH SENSE    1/2 Produced by Frank Marshall Kathleen Kennedy and Barry Mendel written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan photography by Tak Fujimoto music by James Newton Howard distributed by Hollywood Pictures.Running time 1 hour 46 mins.Malcolm Crowe......Bruce WillisCole Sear..........Haley Joel OsmentLynn Sear..........Toni ColletteAnna Crowe.........Olivia WilliamsParents guide PG-13 (discreet violence terror profanity)Showing at area theaters Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""http//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> comments powered by Disqus Commenting policy | Comments FAQ FEATURED ARTICLESTiffany Trump and Naomi Biden graduate Penn dad and granddad looking onApothecary gardens fuel farm-to-medicine-cabinet movementCruz pledges to unify GOP AmericansMoreDe Mazia Art Brings 2.38 MillionLeader Of Jbm Sentenced To Life Aaron Jones Was Convicted Of Conspiring To Distribute 100 Million In Cocaine.

"CuteFella Slate Sign In Sign Up CuteFella CuteFella Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Aug. 20 1999 930 PM CuteFella Hugh Grant reaches a new pinnacle of adorableness in Mickey Blue Eyes; TheSixth Sense is sentimental but it has its wrenching moments. By David Edelstein Mickey Blue Eyes Directed by Kelly Makin Warner Bros. The Sixth Sense Directed by M. Night Shyamalan Buena Vista PicturesTwin Falls Idaho Directed by Michael Polish Sony Pictures ClassicsBowfinger Directed by Frank Oz Universal Pictures After his notorious arrest by the Hollywood vice squad in 1995 Hugh Grant showed up on talk shows to promote a new film and--it couldnt be avoided--offer an explanation for his ""crime."" Well not an explanation precisely. Asked about the incident hed wince bite his lip bat his eyelashes shrug sheepishly and look adorably abashed. His contrition was so winning that one cartoonist suggested he could make big money as a spokesman for governments accused of human rights abuses. (On Saddam Husseins gassing of the Kurds ""Rather a bad move ... terribly sorry."" On the Serb-led slaughter in Sarajevo ""Most embarrassing ... frightful lapse in judgment."") Advertisement In the gangster farce Mickey Blue Eyes Grant takes adorable abashment to delirious new heights. He plays Michael Felgate an English executive for a Sothebys-like New York auction house who proposes to his girlfriend a teacher named Gina Vitale (Jeanne Tripplehorn) and then discovers shes the daughter and niece of powerful crime bosses. Suddenly forced to keep company with men named Vito and Vinnie to bury a corpse beside the East River and to make like a gangster with a voice thats a cross between John Wayne and Tweety Bird the squeamish Englishman winces bites his lip bats his eyelashes shrugs sheepishly and looks--yes--adorably abashed. The shtick would be irritating as hell if it werent so ... adorable. Grant does abashed the way Bogie smoked the way Marilyn flared her lips. Hes not an actor of range (to say the least) but his charismatic discomfort--his breezy uneasiness--makes him a marvelous romantic-comedy star. And the first two-thirds of Mickey Blue Eyes give him an excellent pedestal. Its the stuff of classic farce which puts the wrong man in the wrong place at the wrong time and then fiendishly ups the ante. Pressured by Ginas spooky uncle (a superbly restrained turn by Burt Young) into auctioning off a paranoid sons painting--a resurrected Jesus putting holes in disloyal disciples with a submachine gun--Michael must simultaneously keep the gangsters happy his fiancee (wholl pull the plug on the engagement if she finds out hes enmeshed in the family business) in the dark the FBI from discovering the collusion and--most important in farce--a semblance of dignity. His upper-crust boss is forever escorting a potential investor around the company so that the two can walk in on him in poses that the Hollywood vice squad would find suspect. The director Kelly Makin hits the gags hard--he turns punch lines into slug lines--but his timing is crackerjack. The trick in pulling off this kind of comedy is to wind a lot of jack-in-the-boxes in full view of the audience yet still make it a surprise when they start--at moments of peak pandemonium--springing up. The screenwriters Adam Scheinman and Robert Kuhn have boned up on their Feydeau and Fawlty Towers--not to mention the slew of mobster movies to which they cheerfully make reference (and from which the filmmakers have hired most of the supporting cast). What goes wrong? In the last half-hour the farcical pulse gets lost amid the crosses and double-crosses and triple-crosses and erupting blood squibs and dud psychology. James Caan begins hilariously as Ginas hearty lunkish father but then has to get all noble under the weight of the pictures dumb melodramatic contrivances. Worse Grants linguistically hapless gangster--Mickey Blue Eyes--never makes a climactic reappearance so the filmmakers waste their best invention. As long as Im carping even the movies first third has problems. I found the basic setup--that Michael has no inkling of Ginas family ties--implausible since where I come from you dont ask a woman to marry you (you dont even get past the first date) until youve explained to her the ways in which your family screwed you up and have expressed tender sympathy for the ways in which her family did likewise. Am I the only one who thinks Alice Millers The Drama of the Gifted Child is the dating manual of the 90s? W hile I was on vacation several readers wrote to say that The Blair Witch Project hadnt scared them but oh boy did they freak out at The Sixth Sense. Here they said was one skeeery movie Backlash shmacklash; The Blair Witch Project messed up my head more than anything since Night of the Living Dead (1968) so The Sixth Sense had me shivering in anticipation from its opening credits. Two hours later I emerged with tear-stained cheeks and a lot of admiration for the ""gotcha"" ending (the clues are there but one shakes them off as arty mannerisms) but not especially frightened. The ghosts were seen too clearly--I could practically smell their greasepaint and mascara. The larger point is that the movie directed and written by M. Night Shyamalan belongs to a different genre than Blair Witch which traffics in the irrational the unseen the terror of malevolent nothingness. The Sixth Sense uses the supernatural for reassurance. For all its bogey-man shenanigans it wants to leave you with faith in a higher order--in the possibility that even after death wrongs may be avenged innocents protected and the loose ends of ones life tied up. Ultimately it has less in common with Blair Witch than with such quivering lumps of sentiment as Ghost (1990) and Field of Dreams (1989). The film could be subtitled Field of Nightmares. Its often wrenching anyway. Bruce Willis damaged child psychologist wanders through an autumnal universe from which the warmth has been bleached (the pale yet deep-toned cinematography is by Tak Fujimoto) social intercourse is vaporous and sounds seem piped in from another dimension. (A bus accelerating and decelerating is like a lonely groan.) As the haunted boy in his charge Haley Joel Osment regards the therapist sadly as if seeing into his (lost) soul. Osments pinched old-young face suggests an ancients insight without an ancients defenses--a sensitivity so exquisitely morbid that you worry more for his emotional than physical well-being. You worry too for his mom played with tremulous fierceness by the wonderful Toni Collette. ""Look at my face"" she says when her child ventures the idea that she must think hes crazy. ""I would never think that."" Maybe Ive spent too much time with The Drama of The GiftedChild but that part reduced me to a puddle of mush. More post-vacation catching up The rave reviews for Twin Falls Idaho and Bowfinger made me eager to see them but neither really floated my boat. The first is an absorbing low-budget art movie about conjoined twins the weaker of whom is dying and mordant the other torn (so to speak) between loyalty to his brother and a tenuous connection to the external world--embodied in part by a prostitute (Michele Hicks) who looks like Bridget Fonda as Vampira and acts like a slightly less wooden porn star. You cant exactly say ""Ho-hum another sentimental Siamese-twin flick"" but somehow I felt as if Id been here before. It isnt just the willful echoes of Basket Case (1982) and Dead Ringers (1988). Its the way the twins (played by co-writers Mark Polish and Michael Polish who also directed the film) are photographed to look so wanly beautiful and dear like the hero of the play (not the David Lynch movie) The Elephant Man. They seem enigmatic when whispering in each others ears but when you actually hear what theyre saying its so humdrum that you wonder why they even bother to talk. There are brilliant moments--a flickering black-and-white dream in which theyre separate and riding bicycles is like a gorgeous home movie from the 20s unearthed from someones basement--but the mixture of Diane Arbus freakiness and heart-tugging bathos finally feels a little cheap. Cheaper still is most of Bowfinger a one-joke movie thats like Ed Wood (1994) without the poetry or emotion that Tim Burton managed to coax out of re-creations of Grade Z genre flicks. The one joke--a bunch of untalented impoverished filmmakers devise a movie around a paranoid action star (Eddie Murphy) who has no idea that hes even in it--is occasionally a hoot but it also requires Murphy to act like a scaredy-cat Negro out of a 30s ghost movie. I laughed but I came out depressed. On the basis of his script and performance Steve Martins vision of moviemaking is of a scam perpetrated by hustling morons. Has he been spending too much time with David Mamet? David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air.

But this time hes not in a huge spectacular high-budget action flick. There are no torn T-shirts carefully placed grease marks or fake sweat in his current film. Instead hes chosen to star in a dark and murky psychological thriller called ""The Sixth Sense."" Theres an old adage when it comes to basic storytelling. If you grab your audiences attention at the beginning and hook them into the story -- and then provide a memorable and exciting ending -- you can be forgiven for a lot of less-then-thrilling material in between. ""The Sixth Sense"" is a case in point. Willis plays child psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe. At the beginning of the film he and his wife Anna played by Olivia Williams are celebrating an award hes received for his work with children. One of those troubled children -- all grown up now and played by a totally unrecognizable Donnie Wahlberg -- appears out of nowhere shoots the good doctor in revenge for not being cured and then turns the gun on himself. VIDEO Theatrical preview for ""The Sixth Sense"" Windows Media 28K 80K Bang We flash forward to the following autumn. Now apparently on the road to recovery a still-shaken Crowe is given the case of a extremely troubled 8-year-old named Cole Sear played with exceptional talent by 11-year-old Haley Joel Osment. It seems young Cole is seeing and hearing ghosts -- while both asleep and awake -- and he lives in fear that others will find out about his terrifying secret. Scaring up some publicity The fact that Cole is being hounded by dead people isnt completely revealed until halfway through the film but the trailer for the film -- seen in theaters for months -- already has given up the ghost so to speak by making it clear that the kids spooked by spooks. This revelation of major plot points in trailers and television commercials is becoming an annoying fact of life in Hollywood. After Cole finally confides in Willis they try to discover the truth about his visions. Their search throws them both into a waking nightmare with harrowing consequences and a stunning conclusion. This is the second directorial effort by M. Night Shyamalan who also wrote the script. For the most part ""The Sixth Sense"" is crafted fairly well in terms of mood and production design. But ultimately its a slow-moving story about the paranormal. Its also a lot less scary than it could be. But this film primarily is all about Osment who gives an outstanding performance as the centerpiece of the movie. Hes been acting since the age of 5 and audiences may remember him from five years ago when he appeared as the title characters son at the end of ""Forrest Gump."" Without him this film would be far less compelling. Willis turns in a measured and understated performance. And Toni Collette -- who played the title role in the 1994 Australian film ""Muriels Wedding"" -- is believable as the boys confused and frightened mother although her character offers her a limited range of emotion. ""The Sixth Sense"" may be worth seeing for many if only for its surprise ending. Its a finale that could make you think long and hard about death and an afterlife. ""The Sixth Sense"" opens nationwide on Friday. Rated PG-13 for intense thematic material and violent images. 114 minutes.

"When It Comes to Creepiness This Project Has a Sixth Sense - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMovie Review When It Comes to Creepiness This Project Has a Sixth SenseAugust 06 1999|JOHN ANDERSON | FOR THE TIMES It would be rash--foolhardy even--to imply that summer 99 has seen anything like a renaissance of the horror genre. ""Lake Placid"" and ""Deep Blue Sea"" were beached whales. ""The Haunting"" had all the psychological terror of a jury notice (far less actually). ""American Pie"" probably offered some chills if you were a pastry. Otherwise it hasnt been a vintage season.On the other hand ""The Blair Witch Project"" continues to frighten and befuddle in new and unusual fashion (its not a documentary). ""Eyes Wide Shut"" in its own way is an experiment in disequilibrium. And now ""The Sixth Sense"" which has crept up onto summer 99 like a clammy chill has arrived proving if nothing else that there are avenues of terror still open to a filmmaker with nerve.""Sixth Sense"" is certainly a nervy film one that director M. Night Shyamalan (""Wide Awake"") has made so disarmingly eerie its virtually guaranteed to rattle the most jaded of cages. Set in Philadelphia--hometown of its director and coincidentally near-home to New Jersey native Bruce Willis--the film concerns Malcolm Crowe (Willis) honored child psychologist and husband to Anna (Olivia Williams of ""Rushmore"") whos confronted in his home one night by a patient who slipped through the cracks Vincent Gray (a convincingly unhinged Donnie Wahlberg) blaming Crowe for the ""possible mood disorder"" thats still plaguing him puts one bullet in the doctor and another through his own brain.A few months later a recovered but clearly chastened Crowe is sitting on a bench watching the comings and goings of Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) a kid with oversized glasses and the posture of a beaten puppy. Cole we learn also has a ""possible mood disorder."" And Malcolm intends to do for Cole what he couldnt do for Gray.But the creepiness has already set in. Mixing weird rhythms and gothic-Catholic iconography--static shots of church friezes petrified statuary and the Latin muttered by Cole when he seeks sanctuary among the pews. ""Sixth Sense"" is off-kilter from the start rich in a kind of matter-of-fact horror. Because what Malcolm doesnt know what he cant possibly suspect until Cole eventually bares his soul are the depths and echoes of the boys possible ""disorder.""These days trailers are less often ads for movies than their abridged versions so while we havent actually seen any for ""Sixth Sense"" were hoping they tell you nothing. Theres little to say about the story that wont ruin some twist or turn other than to say that the various lapses in logic will either be explained away or essentially wont matter because the film goes so deftly about what it does.So do the actors for the most part. Toni Collette who plays Coles single and slightly brassy mother is a virtual revelation (she was this good in ""Velvet Goldmine"" too). Williams consigned to the small role of distanced wife is also fine. Willis as hes been in some of his better movies is essentially a supporting player here. Its Osment whose Cole is such an intelligent tortured child who easily gives the best kid performance of the year. In fact if he were to get an Oscar nomination it would be both historic and just.Shyamalans script is a clever construct but also contains a great deal of sensitivity to the plight of the ""different"" child. When he drew pictures of a man with a screwdriver through his neck Cole tells Malcolm they called his mother into school. So he started drawing rainbows. ""They dont have meetings about rainbows"" Cole says.If theres a complaint to be had with the film its that the ending goes on far too long belaboring the points that have been made so alarmingly and well. It is as if someone wanted to reinforce the idea that this is a Bruce Willis Film which its not. He can however be proud he was in it. MPAA rating PG-13 for intense thematic material and violent images.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Before The Sixth Sense 29-year-old writer-director M. Night Shyamalans most famous movie was the Rosie ODonnell vehicle Wide Awake. Bruce Willis has made his share of disappointing films one of the most recent of which has him befriending a gifted child. This years other studio ghost story The Haunting is terrible. But forget all that for a moment and give The Sixth Sense the chance it deserves. Willis stars as a Philadelphia psychologist who shortly after receiving an award for his work with children is confronted in his home by a disturbed former patient (Donnie Wahlberg) who feels Willis failed him. A year later he encounters a child (Haley Joel Osment) who reminds him of Wahlberg a boy who eventually reveals he has some traffic with the supernatural. Though not without some genuinely frightening moments The Sixth Sense is less a horror film than a moody piece of magic realism. Shyamalans approach composed largely of Kubrickian extended takes has a sense of purpose and an artful construction that respects both its story and its audience allowing both to take their time sorting things out. Its a style that also brings out the best in its cast; Willis has rarely been better and both Olivia Williams (as Willis wife) and Toni Collette (as Osments overworked deeply concerned mother) turn in convincing performances. Also great--and had he not been the film would have been ruined--is Osment whose unrelenting gravity and ability to convey sadness beyond his years threatens to give a good name to child actors. The Sixth Sense teeters on the brink of New Age ludicrousness but it never goes over Like Kieslowski and others Shyamalan knows that what makes for lousy metaphysics can make for powerful metaphor and in the end he creates a deeply surprisingly affecting film out of a little bit of smoke and brimstone.

By Andrew Sarris  08/23/99 1200am M. Night Shyamalans The Sixth Sense materializes on the screen as an effectively understated and moodily engrossing ghost film with a surprisingly satisfying jolt at the end. Bruce Willis reminds me once again that despite his generally bad press he is the most reliable character lead in the business perhaps lacking Gene Hackmans range and Kevin Spaceys flash. But I have lost count of the number of Bruce Willis vehicles that would have been unwatchable if he hadnt been in them. Indeed he reminds me of nobody so much as Robert Mitchum in his unappreciated heyday when he was dismissed as dull and expressionless simply because he didnt tear a passion to tatters at every opportunity. With Mr. Mitchum as with Mr. Willis less was never more. But take a look sometime at Mitchums masterly acting in The Story of G.I. Joe (1945) Out of the Past (1947) and Heaven Knows Mr. Allison (1957) and tell me if he was ever given his due. In The Sixth Sense  Mr. Willis plays a child psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe who is sitting at the top of his profession in Philadelphia the home base also of Mr. Shyamalan writer-director of Praying With Anger and Wide Awake  two films I have never seen though the titles alone reflect a mental-spiritual predilection that may explain some of the quiet strangeness of The Sixth Sense in the currently noisy and overstated movie scene. Thus after an initial burst of violence in which Dr. Crowe is shot by a former child patient grown up into homicidal and suicidal madness who then kills himself the rest of the movie heart and soul is devoted to the slow recuperation of Dr. Crowe from the traumatic loss of self-confidence. He takes on the doubt-ridden treatment of an 8-year-old boy named Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) whose divorced mother Lynn Sear (Toni Collette) is concerned about the boys strange antisocial behavior both in school and at home. The theme of divorce and its disruptive impact upon children is echoed in Coles case history by that of Dr. Crowes adult assailant and suicide Vincent Gray (Donnie Wahlberg). Yet the two cases diverge spectacularly when Cole finally reveals that he sees and hears dead people whose bizarre grimaces and movements terrify him. We get to see these ghosts as well with a minimum of special effects trickery. Meanwhile Dr. Crowes marriage to art gallery owner Anna Crowe (Olivia Williams) is gravely threatened by his lack of attention. What Mr. Willis brings to his role is an extraordinary patience and stillness illuminating the mental processes of Dr. Crowe in his laser-beam penetration of a troubled little boys psyche. The gaining and keeping of trust is uppermost in Dr. Crowes mind and method. In the end the little boy is helping his doctor as much as the doctor is helping him and their necessary final parting is indeed sweet sorrow. Along the way however the dimensions of the two female characters keep shrinking almost to the vanishing point and the very gifted Ms. Collette and Ms. Williams as Coles mother and Dr. Crowes wife are left almost completely in the dark about what has transpired between Cole and Dr. Crowe. A process of healing is implied for both women but their emotional warmth is inadequately projected. Still at least The Sixth Sense is one of the rare current movies about healing rather than harming. The Second Time Around Is Never Like They Say It Is John McTiernans The Thomas Crown Affair  from a screenplay by Leslie Dixon and Kurt Wimmer based on a story by Alan R. Trustman comes out at a time when people are so starved for old-fashioned glamour and elegance that theyll embrace this feature-length coming attraction as the real thing. Not that the original 1968 version with Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway was any world beater but McQueen and Ms. Dunaway (a psychiatrist in the remake) at least had a smidgen of chemistry together even without the toplessness and nudity of the 90s to throw some logs on the fire. Pierce Brosnan is as always so lightweight as a screen personality that he makes Roger Moore look substantial. As for Rene Russo so appealing in action movies she is unable except in one nightclub scene with a virtually see-through gown to project the effortless ease of the stylishly shady lady. She has received a great deal of publicity for daring to do sex scenes at the ripe old age of 45. The implication is that the moguls of the sexist 90s have been unusually cruel and inhuman to middle-aged actresses. Yet if you look back to the supposed Golden Age of womens pictures in the 30s and 40s few actresses on the far side of 40 played anything but mother roles and many achieved that status by the age of 35. Life magazine marveled in 1943 that a 38-year-old Jean Arthur could convincingly play a heavy petting scene on a Washington D.C. stoop with Joel McCrea in George Stevens The More the Merrier . The cream of the jest was that McCrea himself was 38 years old. Yet double standards and all what makes todays movie moguls sexist is not so much the age-casting of actresses but the advanced ages of the male stars who still play bedroom scenes on the screen. Lets face it The camera is cruel; it makes everyone look 10 years older and 10 pounds heavier. Thats why the most sensual actresses look in real life as if they lived entirely on carrot juice. Denis Leary takes top honors in the cast for acting a little while the two leads spend most of their time posing with a variety of luxury items. Mr. Brosnans gentleman thief seems to exalt needless virtuosity over larcenous efficiency. I hate show-offs particularly when it comes to something as crucial to the capitalist system as stealing. What Did Deep Throat Ever Do to Hollywood? Andrew Flemings Dick  from a screenplay by Mr. Fleming and Sheryl Longin plops down on the screen as a thoroughly misguided terminally unfunny fantasy-farce-satire of the Watergate scandal. I cant help suspecting that the only reason that the script got the go-ahead from the powers that be was that someone in the decision-making process decided that todays kids would get orgasms from the obscene ambiguity of the films title with extra mileage from the ""true"" identity of ""Deep Throat"" from the Woodward-Bernstein journalistic saga of the dethroning of Dick Nixon. And sure enough the last sentence of the script manages to combine ""Dick"" with ""sucks."" Dick Nixon resigned from office in 1974 and this is 1999. Twenty-five years is a long time for a topical satire to keep its freshness and snap. The kids dont remember the names of all the players and we graybeards still chuckle over the hilariously glowering Nixon of Dan Aykroyd the heavily and commandingly accented Kissinger of the late John Belushi and the thoughtfully fatuous David Eisenhower of Bill Murray on the70s SaturdayNightLive shows that were contemporaneous with the Watergate frolics in Washington. Dan Hedaya makes a good Nixon until the script makes him out to be not merely guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors but mean to his dog his wife and his daughters. This excess of satiric overkill made even this yellow-dog Democrat a bit uneasy. As much as I rejoiced at Tricky Dicks downfall at the time I regarded Julie Nixons unwavering devotion to her father as worthy of an Antigone. The biggest problem with Dick  however is that its two ditsy teenage heroines are played by Kirsten Dunst and Michelle Williams with so much tongue-in-cheek smugness that they kill all the laughs. Their exploits are performed with such embarrassing clumsiness that the plot collapses around them. To top it off they manage to giggle their way into political correctness on the Vietnam War and on the benevolent effects of the hippie drug culture on American life and even on the cause of world peace. They are faux-naifs to a fault even to the point of mocking the euphemisms of all authority figures. To put a point to it Dick is no Election . It is as mean-spirited between the generations as Election is fair-minded. What remains a little surprising is all the ridicule heaped on Bob Woodward (Will Ferrell) and Carl Bernstein (Bruce McCulloch) with the one overly extended sight joke of the exaggerated Mutt-and-Jeff pairing of the two journalists Woodward towering over the diminutive Bernstein. Out of the Closet And Onto the Screen Patrice Chereaus Those Who Love Me Can Take the Train  from a screenplay by Daniele Thompson Mr. Chereau and Pierre Trividic based on an original idea by Ms. Thompson unwinds as one of the most forceful reminders that what Oscar Wilde once designated ""the love that dare not speak its name"" has now burst out of the closet onto the screen with more and more challenges for critics of all sexual persuasions hitherto permitted to be politely ""tolerant"" and ""understanding"" in mealy-mouthed variations of Terences ""nothing human is alien to me."" This wont do anymore for an intelligently uninhibited confrontation of sexual diversity and carnal warfare like Those Who Love Me Can Take the Train . Having gotten that off my chest I dont know what else to say about a film I had trouble following and understanding. There are 16 characters involved in a funeral cortege from Paris to Limoges for the burial of a famous painter named Jean-Baptiste and briefly seen in flashbacks in the acting persona of Jean-Louis Trintignant who also plays the painters very much alive shoe-merchant brother Lucien. There is a house in Limoges that becomes a bone of contention. There is a troubled marriage. There are noisily volatile homosexual triangles bisexual intrigues an H.I.V.-positive diagnosis and far above the fray is the mischievous and malignant spirit of the painter who continues to torment his supposed friends lovers and admirers from beyond the grave by herding them together into a brawling band of betrayers and betrayed. I must beg off being more specific. The film is too floridly demonstrative and diffuse for my taste. The neuroses of its characters are too exotic. The narrative is too muddled the mise en scene too furiously busy. I pass. May I Recommend Instead If youve never seen Jean Renoirs Grand Illusion (1937) Billy Wilders Some Like It Hot (1959) and Mel Brooks Young Frankenstein (1974) see them at once ahead of all current releases. If youve seen them once or more I dont have to tell you that these imperishable classics can be seen again and again over the years with undiminished enjoyment.

Provided though you havent seen The Sixth Senses trailer. More on that later. Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and his wife Anna (Olivia Williams) return home one evening to find one of his former patients in their bathtub in his jockey shorts and with a gun. Malcolm is a psychologist who treats children. The former patient now a deeply disturbed young man says Malcolm failed him. Then he shoots Malcolm in the belly and then kills himself. Some months later Malcolm still feels the need for redemption. So he looks for another child to help. He finds him in 8-year-old Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment). Coles being raised by single mom Lynn (Toni Collette). It could be divorce trauma that is causing the little boy to obsess over toy soldiers deploy religious figurines as protectors write alarming things in his notebooks and to see and to hear a certain thing where others see and hear nothing. This thing Cole says he sees is revealed in the trailer for the film kneecapping an extremely creepy moment an hour into the film. Writer-director M. Night Shyamalan must surely have resented that. If youre in a theater when this trailer starts -- react when you see Willis talking to an adorable little boy -- close your eyes clap your hands over your ears and say ""lalalalalala"" until its over. We start to see what Cole sees -- Malcolm doesnt -- but that isnt conclusive. Shyamalan could just be letting us into Coles disturbance to show us and Malcolm how difficult will be the task of helping the child. Shyamalan has a genuine shock for us at the end of the film a surprise which is honestly obtained when we mentally rewind the film and inspect it. There are no cheats. Its an unusually intimate film. Shyamalan keeps the camera close to the actors. Much of the dialogue is performed in less-than-conversational tones. Its a very successful tactic. We find ourselves leaning toward this film not just because we feel we need to pay special attention but because we have bonded with sad Malcolm and especially sad little Cole. Willis is quite good and 11-year-old Osment -- he was Forrest Gump Jr. and the little boy in Bogus -- is a marvel. Our heart goes out for this frightened little boy and his resignation to what afflicts him. It is when we are leaning in toward the film that Shyamalan springs his scare stuff; when we are focused like that it doesnt take much scare to get a lot of reaction. For the same firepower the makers of The Haunting would just rattle some more shutters. Real fright comes from the fear that something will happen to someone you care about.

"The Sixth Sense (PG-13) Related Item ""The Sixth Sense"" showtimes A Chillingly Intense Sense By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer Friday August 6 1999 In ""The Sixth Sense"" Bruce Willis tries to uncover Haley Joel Osments dark secret. (Hollywood) Director M. Night Shyamalan Cast Bruce Willis; Haley Joel Osment;Olivia Williams; Toni Collette; Donnie Wahlberg Running Time 1 hour 54 minutes Contains disturbing material and garish wounds ""The Sixth Sense"" is a ghost story and a psychological thriller. But theres something finer to it than that. Perhaps its the deliberate pacing the almost contemplative timbre to the whole thing. And the chilliness the sheer coldness in the air It uses stillness implication and silence in ways that reminded me of ""Seven."" Writer/director M. Night Shyamalan knows how to build atmosphere - this is clear. And he does it painstakingly brick by brick. By the end of the picture a very powerful design becomes clear with a twist that will put your head in a swirl. And launch some spirited discussion Id hope. That final section - in which everything is ""explained"" - may not work for some people. Personally I bought it hook line and sinker because I was so connected to the drama by that point. That was thanks to subtle work from Bruce Willis who plays a child psychologist and a remarkable performance from Haley Joel Osment - as the child he tries to help. The story is this Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Willis) who practices in Philadelphia gets the challenge of his life when he becomes acquainted with Cole Sear. The boy who is 8 has a dark secret. But hes loath to give it away. Malcolm has to make himself available to the boy until he opens up. Its hard not to reveal a little of the movie here Im afraid Cole claims to see ghosts. Just what kind of ghosts they are and what they are seeking - well thats Malcolms mission. And yours. Theres another problem. Cole does not want to talk about this supernatural phenomenon. And his mother (Toni Collete) despite her best intentions seems unable to understand her son let alone believe him. The boy also has abrasions on his body. Could this be a case of child abuse? Malcolm has to pursue this last question with great care and precision. The only way to find out everything he realizes is to get the boys trust. To become his greatest friend. This is an entrancing film which dabbles in profound character revelation and the paranormal - something you dont often see in a movie. And the 11-year-old Osment evokes the boys terror and awful predicament so memorably youll never forget him. Its a great pleasure too to watch Willis playing a restrained role without the usual torn T-shirt smirky quips and battery of firearms. Heroism in this story takes an entirely different set of reflexes. Ultimately my greatest praise goes to Shyamalan whose previous credits include his low-budget 1992 debut ""Praying With Anger"" and the 1997 ""Wide Awake."" His direction is superb and the writing wonderfully mystical. And just when youre feeling spooked theres always a little room for passing humor. At one point Cole explains to Malcolm that his teachers at school became aware that he was a special child when he drew a picture of a man being stabbed in the neck by a screwdriver. ""Everyone got upset. They had a meeting"" says the boy. ""I dont draw like that anymore.""

Starring Bruce Willis Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette. Directed by M. Night Shyamalan. (PG-13. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Everyone who sees ""The Sixth Sense"" will come out talking about the kid. The kid is Haley Joel Osment and hes extraordinary. If this isnt the single best performance ever by a preadolescent male in a motion picture then its tied for whatever is first. Young Osment (hes 11) plays an 8-year-old who sees dead people and hes not hallucinating. Invisible to everyone else dead people present themselves to the boy and without so much as a hello pour out their frustrations. They died violently. They were murdered. Theyre angry. The most distressing thing is as the boy says ""they dont know theyre dead."" Writer-director M. Night Shyamalan wrote himself into what easily could have been a hopeless situation. He created a screenplay that depended on finding a child actor as talented as the 50-year-old James Stewart. Shyamalan needed a kid who could convey the outer limits of inner anguish and torment a kid whose manner suggests that he already knows more about human extremes than a priest a doctor or a front-lines soldier. Bruce Willis as a sympathetic child psychiatrist has more screen time but his role is reactive. Osment carries the drama. Whether one credits precocity intuition or a freakish natural gift the boy gets every drop out of this character. He plays Cole a boy who is more than scared. He doubts his sanity feels guilty and insecure and hes in despair knowing that no one will believe him. In the first scene Willis is shot by a now-adult former patient who then kills himself. Once recovered Crowe sees in Cole a chance to succeed where he failed with the first boy. Willis plays Crowe in a soft-spoken mode. No smirking. His acting is subdued heartfelt and full of loneliness. Never has psychiatry been presented as such a melancholy calling. Crowe devotes all his resources to making a connection with the boy and his personal life suffers. He works all day and when he comes home his wife doesnt talk to him. She is becoming interested in another man. About the only sign that she still cares about Crowe is that she watches their wedding video incessantly. When the dead appear to Cole they come with great urgency as though theyve finally managed to establish a line of communication and need to talk fast before the line cuts out. This element adds to the frightening aspect of these visions not just for the boy but for the audience. A dead girl appears before his eyes vomiting. A dead woman stands in the kitchen screaming about her husband. When Cole turns his head in school he sees hanging victims from 100 years earlier staring at him. ""The Sixth Sense"" is scary in two ways. Its scary in its suggestion of a world within our world one that our minds choose to ignore. Cole tells his psychiatrist that when the hair stands up on your neck that is the dead trying to connect. Theres no doubting Osment when he says these lines. But just as scary or at least as unsettling is the films presentation of human existence as an endless series of tragedies and agonies relieved only by foolish distraction. Shyamalan (""Wide Awake"") in his first major feature builds and sustains an eerie mood made up of equal parts tension and despair. Unlike 90 percent of films ""The Sixth Sense"" gets better as it goes along. Willis and Osment are beautifully supported by Toni Collette as Coles mother. After years of being known for being heavy Collette has pulled a Maria Callas and turned svelte. She plays a working-class mom without the usual Hollywood notes of condescension or nobility. Shes just a matter-of-fact good mom and Collette plays her with every nerve frayed every emotion on the surface of her face. ..

Night Shyamalan; Author M. Night Shyamalan; Runtime (in minutes) 107; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Buena Vista Pictures Posted July 3 2002 -- 1200 AM EDT Cinema literates know when to expect the unexpected in a thriller. Without giving the slightest bit away then let me say that the coolest thing about The Sixth Sense is how this twisty ghost story about a child who sees dead people all around him circumvents all such instincts. Its a psychological thriller that actually thrills. The reluctant medium is Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) a sad little hamster of a boy in atmospherically overcast south Philadelphia. His visions terrify him especially since the folks still look as they did when they died horrible deaths. Cole lives with his mother (Toni Collette); shes empathetic but hes afraid to tell her about his terrors. Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) though is different -- a gifted child psychologist who unlocks Coles secrets. Much of The Sixth Sense is about the slow building of trust between the boy and the man who carries his own sorrows; they bond in a process as shadowy as the passing of a spirit through a room. And Willis is sensitively attuned in a nice quiet performance establishing a touching connection with his costar -- who not to put it too spookily utterly carries the movie with his unnerving talent. The Sixth Sense which is about X-Files-ishly ""believable"" fears and coincidences enjoys setting up X-Files-ish moments of pleasurable anxiety. To that end writer-director M. Night Shyamalan (Wide Awake) working with cinematographer Tak Fujimoto (The Silence of the Lambs) creates a coolly askew visual style investing everyday sights -- doorknobs staircases -- with unexplained menace. While the story unspools and sometimes flags these clues and recurring images amount to little. Running the scenes over in your head afterward though -- and you will forward and back -- uncovers a construction that rewards wide-awake attention.

Charles Taylor Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies Thrillers Entertainment News Movies that play on our fears of a child in peril have a tricky time of it. Push things too far and the suspense becomes unpleasant. The supernatural thriller ""The Sixth Sense"" about a little boy cursed with the gift of seeing the dead never goes over the edge in exploitation. But because the movie never fully engages us it never quite manages to allay our queasiness about watching the boys distress. And thats compounded (unintentionally) by Haley Joel Osments intense performance as Cole the young seer. For all the attention M. Night Shyamalan pays to the look and mood of the movie hes a klutz when it comes to plotting and characterization. And because his clumsiness keeps us outside Cole he never achieves the empathy the character deserves. So the movie becomes the vaguely unpleasant task of watching a childs suffering from arms length.The core of ""The Sixth Sense"" is Coles relationship with Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) a child psychiatrist whos never recovered from being unable to help a particularly troubled patient. Malcolm sees Cole as his second chance (havent we all earned a break from redemption movies?). But he becomes distracted from his wife (played by Olivia Williams who was the best thing in the inexplicably overrated -- and just plain inexplicable -- ""Rushmore"" and has nothing to do here) and an unaccountable distance begins creeping into the marriage.There are some horror movies like ""The Innocents"" poetic enough to get by on mood. Shyamalan though is a pedant. He appears to think hes creating an eerie atmosphere layer by layer with the movies unrelievedly dingy look (it was shot by Tak Fujimoto) and the funereal pacing of each scene. But the tempo only makes you wonder where the movies connective tissue has gone. Some scenes are nonsensical. When Cole is locked in a crawl space at a birthday party and screams to get out while his mother (Toni Collette) pulls frantically at the locked door I couldnt figure out why Shyamalan had directed the actresses playing the rest of the mothers to just stand around and watch her. And though were told Coles talent is seeing the dead he appears in one scene where he humiliates a school teacher to be able to read the minds of the living. And Malcolms explanation to Cole that maybe the dead people he sees are trying to talk to him never explains the physical abuse the ghosts inflict on him. Shyamalan also makes the mistake of showing us the ghosts; as soon as we get a look at them all fear dissipates.Shyamalan seems to have no idea how to dramatize anything. We expect there to be a conflict between Malcolms belief that Cole is suffering from a form of psychosis and our knowledge that the little boys visions are real; the director simply introduces a bit of business that convinces Malcolm and the movie proceeds from there. There isnt even a scene where Willis has to admit to himself that the paranormal actually exists. (Shyamalan even botches Malcolms discovery that Cole is telling the truth -- he finds the proof he needs on a tape recording. But while it plays the director allows James Newton Howards score to drown it out.) You Might Also Like Maybe Shyamalans ineptness is a blessing. If he decided to dramatize every scene we might have to suffer through more sequences like the horrendous one where Cole goes to a dead girls funeral to deliver a message to her father. The revelation mixes gruesomeness with mawkishness and piles anguish on a character whos already grieving a dead child; just watching it made me feel unclean.Of the actors Toni Collette whos built a impressive body of supporting performances (like the wounded and brittle one she gave in ""Velvet Goldmine"") comes off best. When her Lynn takes Cole to a party at the home of a well-to-do schoolmate without overdoing a thing she lets you feel exactly how out of place this working-class woman feels in the plush surroundings. I wish the role allowed more of her humor to come out but theres a nice persevering toughness under her worn-out surface. She also has the movies creepiest moment looking at photos of her son and realizing that in each picture theres an inexplicable streak of light hovering near him. Bruce Willis connects effortlessly with his young co-star Osment but their scenes havent been directed to build on the connection. Theres nothing wrong with Willis performance and its great to see him cast in something besides an action movie. Hes an essentially warm believable actor and he has enough charisma not to turn the role of an ordinary guy into a dullard. But Shyamalans conception of the role which builds up to a final kicker tamps Willis down. (Hes genuine enough in the tricked-up finale to make you wish hed find a film worthy of that emotion.)Ill give this to ""The Sixth Sense"" Its the cause for the funniest production note Ive read in years. In Shyamalans bio (included in the press material) were told ""At age 17 he stood before his parents both doctors surrounded by pictures of the other twelve doctors in his family and informed them that although he graduated cum laude and received academic scholarships to several prestigious medical programs he had instead decided to attend the New York University Tisch School of the Arts to study filmmaking."" Just think he broke his poor parents hearts to make this mishigas. Kids. Charles Taylor is a columnist for the Newark Star-Ledger. More Charles Taylor.

Believe it ""The Sixth Sense"" may be far more subdued than the summers other spectral sensation but the chills imparted by its eerie depiction of a terrified child haunted by the undead are much harder to shake. ""The Sixth Sense"" written and directed by a precocious young Philadelphian named M. Night Shyamalan is the summers biggest surprise particularly for viewers who had gotten used to seeing Willis in moribund mainstream fare. In the film Willis is Dr. Malcolm Crowe a child psychologist shot in his home by a deranged and suicidal intruder (Mark Wahlberg) who once was his patient. Willis is OK in this movie but its not his picture anyway. The film belongs entirely to an 11-year-old kid named Haley Joel Osment. This TV veteran (as an infant he played Murphy Browns baby) delivers what may be the greatest performance ever by a child actor one that should be remembered as one of the most Oscar-worthy turns this year. Osment is Cole Sear a profoundly troubled little boy whom Dr. Crowe takes on as a patient a year after the attack. Cole has a terrible secret which it takes him a long time to confess to Dr. Crowe. Because weve seen the trailer we know it He sees ghosts. Everywhere. All the time. And they scare him to death. What do they want? Why are they leaving wounds on the boys body? How can they be dispelled? Shyamalan reveals the spirits to us sparingly scheduling their abrupt appearance for maximum terror. (I havent heard screaming like that in a theater in ages; I havent screamed like that in a theater in ages.) For all the squealing he paces the drama slowly wrapping it in a frigid air of brooding contemplation. It will be too slow for some but I found it perfect for allowing the depth of Coles alienation and terror to seep in. The screenplay stands above the horror genre in being a minutely detailed and entirely convincing portrait of a suffering childs character which has been misshapen by the paranormal. It is impossible to take your eyes off Osment who vividly conveys the hopelessness of a sensitive intelligent child who bears burdens beyond all telling. Depressed isolated shunned as a freak by his classmates Cole is misunderstood by his stressed-out mother (Toni Collette) and trapped in a nightmare no one could possibly believe. Though you rarely see the ghosts Osment performs with such sustained and concentrated intensity you feel his terror as your own. Its as virtuoso a major film debut as any since Edward Norton freaked audiences out and launched his brilliant career in ""Primal Fear."" Cole reminds Dr. Crowe of the tormented patient who shot him before turning the gun on himself and the shrink chooses to work with Cole in hope of seeking redemption - and perhaps a new lease on his failing marriage to his depressed wife (Olivia Williams). But the spectacular twist ending clues us in that Cole might have done some choosing of his own. Its the only shock in ""The Sixth Sense"" greeted not with a shriek but with a gasp at how masterfully plotted this superb film is. --- THE SIXTH SENSE Starring Haley Joel Osment Bruce Willis. Written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan. Running time 107 minutes. Rated PG-13. At Village East East 86th St. Cinemas 1 2 3 others.

Thinking Mans Horror Story - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Bruce Willis Thinking Mans Horror StoryMovies - Movie Review`Sixth Sense Is Masterful Study In Desolation And HopeAugust 6 1999|By Jay Boyar Sentinel Movie CriticFor more reviews along with schedules maps and directions to theaters check out the movies area of Calendar Online at calendar.or landosentinel .comPicture Bruce Willis in your mind and youll probably see him smirking. That smirk - or the edge of irony it suggests - is what has kept him from becoming just another macho lunkhead in his popular action flicks.But theres another Bruce Willis too a smirkless one. This is the Bruce Willis who knows how to act - the guy weve glimpsed in ambitious little pictures like In Country and especially Mortal Thoughts.Its this second Bruce Willis who shows up for work in The Sixth Sense a seductively delicate horror film about an 8-year-old boy named Cole who claims that he can see ghosts.Willis plays Dr. Malcolm Crowe a successful child psychologist who early on is attacked by a former patient. The experience leaves him traumatized lost. Something inside him has died.Dr. Crowe feels that the only way to redeem himself for failing to help that former patient is to somehow find a way to help Cole.A becalmed - even benumbed - role like Dr. Crowe may seem to exist outside of Willis range. But Willis turns out to be marvelous here.Wrapped in a dull-gray three-piece suit he brings a poignancy to his characters detachment that supports the entire production His eyes nearly empty from hurt the actor becomes the still sad soul of The Sixth Sense.If the movie were distinguished by Willis quietly devastating performance alone that would have been enough to make it worth a look. But everything about this masterful study in desolation and hope supports the terrific work that Willis does.Young Haley Joel Osment (Forrest Jr. in Forrest Gump) as the child who sees ghosts also gives a remarkable performance.Cast as Cole he seems frightened and confused by his special powers yet brave enough to try to get a handle on them. How many adults could deal with the sights that Cole sees - these spirits who still walk the Earth carrying with them the grisly wounds that caused the demise of their bodies?And yet the cloud of anxiety that hangs over the boy is so dark and heavy that you cant help but wonder if he is entirely sane. Could all of this be in his mind?Dr. Crowe seems to think so at first. But the more he observes Cole the less certain he is How could the boy know the things that he knows if he were not plugged into some spectral world?Willis and young Osment arent the only ones who offer top-notch performances.As Dr. Crowes wife Olivia Williams (Rushmore) is a portrait of lovely desolation a woman who seems deserted by her husbands increasing remoteness. And Toni Collette (Muriels Wedding) is tough and tender as Coles working-class mom a strong person in torment because she cant make sense of her boys strange behavior.All of the actors - Willis included - seem to have signed a blood oath not to make a single sound or gesture that would not serve the story which was written by M. Night Shyamalan the 28-year-old phenom who also directed this quiet masterpiece. They must have known that they were working on something very fragile and special.Not only does The Sixth Sense explore profound emotions not only is it phenomenally creepy and conspicuously nonexploitative but it is also surprisingly ingenious. Shyamalan cunningly uses our lowered expectations about horror movies to hide his true purpose.Again and again things dont seem quite to add up. Again and again he allows us to assume that the fault lies in the writing or editing - small flaws that have crept into the moviemaking process.Only at the end are those ``flaws revealed to be amazingly clever sleights-of-hand.To say any more about this would be cruel; in fact I hope I havent said too much already.If I have let me try to make up for it my advising you to see The Sixth Sense which opens today right away - before someone else ruins more of it for you.Not only does this production contain what is probably Willis strongest performance and a lot of other fine acting but it is also one of the best films of the year. And its sure to be a movie that the people who see it will want - make that need - to talk about.When it comes to that sort of thing I have a sort of sixth sense.

"`Sixth Sense Yields Twists - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Movies.`Sixth Sense Yields TwistsAugust 06 1999|By Mark Caro Tribune Movie Writer.Watching a movie entails putting your faith in the filmmakers telling the story. When you know youre viewing a well-made film youre willing to follow the story in odd directions where you might not otherwise have chosen to venture. If the director seems to have little reason for putting one scene in front of the other youll likely have less tolerance for feeling lost.One of the frustrations and ultimate pleasures of watching ""The Sixth Sense"" is that for much of the time youre not really sure what the movie is about. Is this the story of how a child psychologist (Bruce Willis) helps an 8-year-old boy (Haley Joel Osment) overcome his alienation so he can assimilate among his fellow schoolmates? Is it really a study of childhood mental illness?Is it about a boy with supernatural powers? Is the focus actually how a man tries to redeem his professional mission while healing marital wounds? Or is the movie something else altogether?Its a rarity for a movie to be willing to try your patience like ""The Sixth Sense"" does and even more of one for your perseverance to be so amply rewarded. I dont want to give away any secrets -- and knowing whether and when to reveal secrets is a key theme here -- but at a time when so many movies use plot twists solely to fool audiences rather than to illuminate whats going on writer-director M. Night Shyamalan (""Wide Awake"") has carefully plotted his story so that the ending not only moves you but prompts you to see everything that preceded it in a new light.This is not the first movie to feature Willis trying to save a troubled kid but its a huge improvement over -- and perhaps even the actors apology for -- last years ""Mercury Rising"" which uses an autistic boy as a moving-target prop for brain-dead action sequences. That movie was much worse than Willis was; hes actually quite a warm empathetic performer when the role doesnt call for smirking.Here he plays Dr. Malcolm Crowe who after being honored at an awards banquet returns home with his wife Anna (Olivia Williams) to find that a deranged former patient (played by ex-New Kid on the Block Donnie Wahlberg) has broken into their South Philadelphia home and is hiding in their bathroom. After a disturbing end to that confrontation the action flashes forward to the following autumn as a downtrodden Malcolm seeks professional redemption.He sees his chance with a boy named Cole Sear whose history in many ways parallels that of the patient Malcolm thinks he failed. Like the ex-patient Cole is taunted by schoolmates and nicknamed Freak. But Cole seems haunted by more than just typical schoolyard torments and as Malcolm digs deeper he discovers that some real or perceived supernatural elements may be at work.Osment has one of those child faces that looks like it has experienced adult woes and he has a wise-beyond-his-years way of delivering lines. When Malcolm asks him about his day at school he conveys not only dry sarcasm but sadness as he responds that he was picked first for kickball won the game with a homer and was carried off on everyones shoulders.With Toni Collette turning in strong work as Coles young mother whom Cole wants to shield from his secrets ""The Sixth Sense"" at times seems like an especially well-done television movie. But as Coles supernatural visions come increasingly into play the movie takes on a horror-movie creepiness that on one hand is effective in that its grounded in a sympathetic characters psyche but it also gets heavy-handed. The music becomes overbearing at tense moments and Coles in-class stand-off with a stuttering teacher (Chicagos Bruce Norris) is pumped to the point of shrillness.At times you wonder where Shyamalan thinks hes going. Is the buildup just a prelude to unleashing computer-generated evil spirits? Is the movie going to cross that fine line between inspiring sympathy for a disburbed boy and exploiting his troubles for sentimental or cheap-thrills purposes? And why does Malcolms wife remain so unsympathetic to his obsessive desire to help Cole?Then comes the resolution which clarifies everything beautifully. Perhaps the most startling part is the realization that in the turn-off-your-brain season of summer youve just experienced an uncommonly serious-minded movie thats brave enough to engage our deepest emotions on issues of death madness illusion and forgiveness. Thats the biggest thrill of them all.``THE SIXTH SENSE(star) (star) (star) 1/2Written and directed by M.

Directed and written by M. Night Shyamalan. 107 minutes. Several theaters. ""PG-13"" - Parental guidance advised because of intense thematic material and violent images. Rarely has a filmmaker made a recovery as complete as ""The Sixth Sense."" Its the third writing-directing effort from 28-year-old M. Night Shyamalan whose sophomore movie ""Wide Awake"" was platitudinous and dramatically inert (his 1993 debut ""Praying With Anger"" has not yet been released). Both pictures are concerned with children and their understanding of death but theres a world of difference in how they approach the subject. ""Wide Awake"" was the story of a child coming to terms with the death of his grandfather. ""The Sixth Sense"" focuses on a boy who appears to have the ability to see dead people and communicate with them. It may just be that the Philadelphia-based Shyamalan is better at creating dread than uplift but ""The Sixth Sense"" clicks in a way that the earlier sunnier picture never did. Although it has its sentimental moments especially near the end the picture is genuinely unsettling in a way that no other film this summer has been - and that includes ""The Blair Witch Project."" Eleven-year-old Haley Joel Osment who played Tom Hanks son in ""Forrest Gump"" and Avery Brown on ""Murphy Brown"" is Shyamalans chief asset. He effortlessly brings an otherworldly quality to Cole Sear an 8-year-old who wont tell his concerned mother (Toni Collette) whats bothering him. But he will open up to Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) a gentle child psychologist who eventually gets Cole to tell him what he sees and feels. It turns out that the dead people Cole knows have not severed their connections with the living who in some cases have hurt them too deeply. Cole sometimes feels threatened by these spirits - they even leave marks on his body that his mother gets blamed for creating - and they show him things that are almost too horrendous for a child to bear. But he also communicates with dead people who have reassuring messages to send the living. Theres a dream-like quality to much of ""The Sixth Sense"" that suggests that the story is taking place on some undefined other level yet its not clear until the twist ending exactly what that might be. Early in the picture one of Dr. Crowes frightened patients (Donnie Wahlberg) turns up at the doctors home and terrifies Crowe and his wife (Olivia Williams). The episode ends without resolution and the wife becomes a near-phantom throughout the rest of the picture. Dr. Crowe keeps ignoring her showing up late for dinner growing jealous as he watches her embark on a more satisfying relationship with someone else. Shyamalan artfully hints at what all this might mean while continuing to concentrate on what Cole has to reveal to Dr. Crowe. Theres nothing forced about Osments work here. He suggests the gravity and intelligence that Henry Thomas brought to ""E.T."" and the young Roddy McDowall demonstrated in ""How Green Was My Valley."" Theres no show-bizzy precocity about what he does. The boy has an uncanny ability to suggest Coles secretive haunted soul and he seems to have inspired Willis to give perhaps his most self-effacing performance. If you couldnt take this relationship seriously there would be no movie - and these two actors may never be better than they are here. Copyright (c) 1999 Seattle Times Company All Rights Reserved.

Moody pic is ominous without being scary or suspenseful for most of its running time but the positioning of a child at the center of otherworldly goings-on Bruce Willis presence and the promise of more thrills than it actually delivers could spell sleeper status for this Buena Vista release. A terrific last-minute story twist goes a fair way toward redeeming ""The Sixth Sense"" a mostly ponderous tale of paranormal communication across the River Styx. Moody low-key and semi-pretentious effort is ominous without being scary or suspenseful for most of its running time but the positioning of a child at the center of otherworldly goings-on has worked many times before and combo of the themes proven appeal Bruce Willis presence and the promise of more thrills than it actually delivers (a la ""The Haunting"") could spell sleeper status for this late-summer Buena Vista release. Borderline dull to sit through ""The Sixth Sense"" is actually rather interesting to think about afterward because of the revelation of its ending. The film could conceivably be more rewarding upon a second viewing in light of what one knows going in. Few pictures have hinged their effectiveness so completely upon information withheld until the last moment. Ten-minute prologue has a mental case (Donnie Wahlberg) breaking into the Philadelphia home of child psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Willis) and his wife Anna (Olivia Williams). After accusing the doctor of having failed him Wahlbergs character shoots Malcolm before turning the gun on himself. The following autumn the slowly recovering Malcolm takes an interest in the case of 8-year-old Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) the unusually bright son of sorely taxed single mother Lynn (Toni Collette). Through the accretion of small details revealed with aggravating tediousness in one sluggish reel after another Cole is presented as a kid obsessed with toy soldiers and religious figures prone to violent free-association writing victimized by divorce trauma able to envision what happened in certain places years before and most crucial capable of seeing and hearing the dead. This news which comes halfway through is scarcely surprising but slightly enlivens matters as pic has until then been largely concerned with Malcolms ineffectual attempts to get the guarded kid to open up. Malcolm seems to have been so shaken by his shooting that he has little confidence in his professional abilities while the preoccupied doc suspects that his lovely wife may be having an affair. Gradually Coles visions increase -- people hanging from the rafters of his school which used to be a prison a kid with the back of his head blown away a teenage girl from the neighborhood dying. Often as in ""The Haunting"" the presence of ghosts is indicated by frosty breath and James Newton Howards score effectively builds and sustains a threatening mood. But Philadelphia-based writer-director M. Night Shyamalan (""Praying With Anger"" ""Wide Awake"") keeps the dramatic temperature low throughout attempting to make mood and state-of-mind the focus of the film but producing a lot of downtime on a moment-by-moment basis. Acting is in tune with the overall sense of understatement. Osment who played Forrest Gump Jr. is the standout here evoking with his straight-faced intelligence some exceptional British moppet thesps over the years. Willis is at his most subdued which for long periods makes it seem like hes sleepwalking through the role but in the end his performance makes a lot of sense. Williams and Collette are OK in the seriously circumscribed female parts. Production values are serviceable.

"Sixth Sense The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; sixth-sense-the ) Sixth Sense The (United States 1999) A movie review by James Berardinelli With his third feature effort writer/director M. Night Shyamalan has taken a huge step in the wrong direction. After showing great strides of maturity between his ineffective debut Praying with Anger and 1998s appealing Wide Awake Shyamalan has backslided alarmingly with The Sixth Sense. While this picture shares many qualities with Wide Awake (a child protagonist a central spiritual theme and being set in Shyamalans home city of Philadelphia) its an inferior product. It is not well written well acted or well directed. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is a revered psychologist who has just earned an award from the mayor for his efforts with children. On the night that Crowe and his wife Anna (Olivia Williams) are celebrating his triumph they arrive home to find an intruder in their bathroom. He is Vincent Gray (Donnie Wahlberg) one of Crowes few failures. After rambling about Crowes faults as a psychiatrist and asking ""Do you know why youre afraid when youre alone?"" he brandishes a gun then shoots himself and his doctor. Cut to ""Next Fall."" Crowe has recovered from his wounds physically but not emotionally. A gulf has developed between him and his wife. The once-loving couple hardly talks and he suspects that shes having an affair. As a means to assuage his guilt Crowe begins to work with 9-year old Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) a boy who shows similar problems to those displayed by Vincent Gray at that age. Crowe is determined to accomplish for Cole what he could not do for his former patient. But the task he has set for himself is not an easy one. Cole sees and hears things that others cannot and he is afraid to open up to his mother Lynn (Toni Collette) for fear that she will think hes a freak. Some interesting things happen during the final half-hour of The Sixth Sense including a clever (albeit entirely predictable) twist at the very end. Unfortunately to get to that point its necessary to endure 75 minutes of some of the most dull turgidly paced film making this side of Meet Joe Black. This movie plods along daring viewers to remain awake. I had to employ all of my usual tricks to keep from falling asleep. Alas one critic at the screening wasnt as lucky; her snores could be heard throughout the theater. This is not a strong or effectively executed screenplay. Theres no sense of subtlety. The dialogue is stilted. The characters say and do things only because the plot makes certain demands of them. With the exception of Cole no character has more dimensions than a sheet of paper. And theres a lack of internal consistency and logic; the movie doesnt even play by its own rules. Perhaps another draft (or a complete re-write) of the script would have attenuated the amplitude of the flaws. There are some interesting ideas in The Sixth Sense - especially the way in which Coles acceptance of his abilities brings about an awakening - but the good things are deeply buried. The Sixth Sense is obviously an attempt by Bruce Willis to broaden his range. The actor best known for action roles in films like Die Hard has effectively explored a few dramatic parts in the past (most notably in In Country) but this may be the first time he has consciously attempted to essay a low-key persona. It doesnt work. Only in the first scene does Willis exhibit any life; after that he has a tendency to fade into the background. Part of the problem is undoubtedly that his character is badly written but theres also a distinct lack of energy in the performance. Willis co-star is young Haley Joel Osment a child thespian who has shown promise in films like Forrest Gump (as Forrest Jr.) and Bogus. Unfortunately Osments work here is merely adequate emphasizing the need that child actors have for strong directors (a point that should be remembered when condemning Jake Lloyds turn in The Phantom Menace). Osment is occasionally effective but based on his past work I expected a more captivating performance. Shyamalan fails to cull the most he can from the young actor. Toni Collette (Muriels Wedding) deserves recognition for doing something with an underwritten role. Nevertheless Lynns relationship with Cole which could have been an emotional cornerstone of The Sixth Sense feels muted. Theres only one scene between these two that possesses any depth (and that happens near the end). Meanwhile Olivia Williams (Rushmore) is criminally underused. Its a shame because much of the films impact depends on our understanding a few things about Anna but shes not on screen enough for us to recognize her as anything more significant than a footnote to the main story. There are undoubtedly those who will enjoy The Sixth Sense simply because of the spiritual angle which tries to say something about the connection between this world and the next one. Todays society has an undeniable fascination with supernatural/pseudo-religious issues. (Is there any other way to explain the success of pabulum like TVs ""Touched by an Angel""?) But unlike in movies such as What Dreams May Come this motion picture is saddled with a murky unimaginative vision. At its best its merely competent; at its worst it has a movie making-by-the-numbers feel. The Sixth Sense joins Arlington Road in proving that a forceful or clever conclusion is not enough to redeem an otherwise uneven and tepid production. Sixth Sense The (United States 1999) Director M.
