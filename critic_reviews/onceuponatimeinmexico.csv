Director Robert Rodriguez made the film for about 30 million ... more Photo HO Blood and guts and guffaws in Mexico 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Once Upon a Time in Mexico Action film. Starring Antonio Banderas Salma Hayek Johnny Depp Willem Dafoe and Danny Trejo. Directed by Robert Rodriguez. (Rated R 98 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The summers movies included a parade of mediocre sequels and Robert Rodriguezs ""Spy Kids 3D"" was part of the problem. The directors excellent new film ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"" is a belated apology for all the routine follow-ups filmgoers have endured over the past three months making up for Rodriguezs own sequel while taking the sting off ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" ""Dumb and Dumberer"" and a few others. ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"" is Rodriguezs third entry in the ""El Mariachi"" series -- the original was filmed more than 10 years ago with a few thousand dollars and no big-name actors. The trilogy has stayed fresh the same way the ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and ""Mad Max"" franchises did -- by keeping the action constant the writing witty and by rotating in fresh new faces with each sequel. Antonio Banderas took over the lead role in the 1995 sequel ""Desperado"" and returns for the third movie with no signs of boredom. Thats probably because he was given a clever plot and great actors to work with. The film begins with El Mariachi brooding over a recent devastating loss. As he considers revenge the guitar-strumming hit man becomes embroiled in espionage being orchestrated by CIA puppet master Sands (Johnny Depp). While higher-profile sequels jettison half their stars (look at the ""Terminator"" and ""American Pie"" franchises) Rodriguez uses his reputation to add talent including series newcomers Willem Dafoe as a drug lord and Mickey Rourke as his shifty pawn. Eva Mendez plays another government mercenary type and manages the near-impossible feat of being more sexy than A-list hottie Selma Hayek who returns as the Mariachis one true love. Hayek Cheech Marin and Danny Trejo reprise their ""Desperado"" roles in ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"" but series newcomer Depp is given the most screen time. As a CIA operative who wears a ""Cleavage Inspection Agency"" T- shirt and obsesses over slow-roasted pork Depp is still in playful pirate mode maintaining roguish humor even in the most dire circumstances. Hes a welcome counterpoint to the brooding Banderas who carries the emotional weight of the movie. The action ranges from a Peckinpah-style bloodbath to a chained-together-at- the-wrist escape scene involving Banderas and Hayek that is more thrilling and inventive than anything James Bond has executed in two decades. A shootout in a church stands out and even copious screen time for Enrique Iglesias as a younger guitar bandit cant ruin the finale. Despite the movies dark humor violence and the occasional nonvoluntary facial surgery that will drive away the queasy ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"" is the most crowd-pleasing film in the series. Still the studio would have good sense not to add a ""From the Maker of Spy Kids "" marketing tag onto this film. The sensibilities fall somewhere between Sam Raimis ""Army of Darkness"" and Quentin Tarantinos ""Pulp Fiction"" and the movie will be a turnoff for people who dont like their violence gratuitous (more than one joke comes at the expense of human life). Those moviegoers can always watch ""The Italian Job"" again. The rest of us can enjoy this late-summer winner and consider the apology accepted. -- This film contains copious violence and sexual situations.

Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek are married in Once Upon a Time in Mexico. Depp plays a gun-slinging corrupt CIA agent in Robert Rodriguezs entertainingly quirky film a sequel to El Mariachi and Desperado. Depp tosses off nearly as many deadpan quips as he did in Pirates and steals the movie from everyone else in the cast including a rugged Antonio Banderas who is perfect for the role of a man haunted by grief. Depps good looks and Banderas smoldering appeal go a long way toward softening the blow of Mexicos bullet-riddled action sequences. Stunning Salma Hayek co-stars as Banderas beloved murdered wife. All quiet on the set All quiet on the set Once Upon a Time in Mexico is rated R but the set itself was rated G. Banderas brought daughter Stella now 6 along and Rodriguez set up shop with his three sons Rocket Racer and Rebel all under 8. For Depp leaving his 4-year-old daughter Lily-Rose to go south of the border wasnt an option. (He and Vanessa Paradis now have a son Jack 1 as well.) ""They grow and you miss so much stuff"" he says. ""Its such a brief period of time that kiddies are kiddies before they begin to grow up. I dont want to miss a second of it."" But he didnt take any chances reports Rodriguez. ""I knew Id get along with Johnny really well because hes as paranoid a dad as me"" he says. ""He brought bottled water because he didnt want his daughter to get sick. Guys cursed with imaginations can imagine the worst things happening to your children."" This is the third installment in Rodriguezs saga of the legendary guitarist hero known as El Mariachi (Banderas). ""We call him El"" local crook Danny Trejo explains. ""As in The. "" Plays on words make for some strangely funny dialogue. Depp asks Trejo to join him on his mission to kill a corrupt general who is planning a coup. When Trejo hesitates Depp asks ""Are you a Mexi-can or a Mexi-cant?"" (Related item Watch Once Upon a Time in Mexicos trailer) Depp is an eccentric who orders pork and tequila wherever he goes urging everyone to sample his meals. But he has more on his plate than the other white meat. He lines up Banderas and two musician pals (Enrique Iglesias and Marco Leonardi) to pose as mariachis and stop the coup. Banderas is fueled by vengeance The general shot and killed his wife and daughter. Noteworthy supporting performances include a black-haired mustachioed Willem Dafoe as the head of a drug cartel and Mickey Rourke as an American fugitive forever toting a rheumy-eyed Chihuahua. Rodriguez who not only wrote and directed Mexico but also shot edited and scored it makes his worlds uniquely vivid. Such also was the case with all three of his Spy Kids films. In Mexico Rodriguez has fashioned a swaggering fantasy that pays homage to spaghetti Westerns such as Sergio Leones The Good the Bad and the Ugly. Plenty of blood is shed lots of powerful artillery is fired and action sequences provide astounding car crashes and fiery explosions. But Rodriguez is such a visual stylist and the violence is so cartoonish that the flurry of whizzing bullets and growing pile of bodies is not as offensive as it might be.

In 1992 he crafted ""El Mariachi"" on a budget of 7000 and though he has found mainstream success in the years since notably with the ingenious kiddie tinsel of the ""Spy Kids"" series he continues to work apart from the Hollywood axis toiling out of an elaborate home studio in Austin where he more or less cobbles together his movies from scratch. In a fundamental way his style hasnt changed. Hes still a grandiose primitive of whiz-kid technology. Rodriguez went south of the border to shoot Once Upon a Time in Mexico the third entry (after 1995s ""Desperado"") in his ""Mariachi"" trilogy. He photographed the picture himself using an easy-to-wield high-definition video camera and he also wrote produced directed scored and edited (or as it says in the opening credits ""chopped"") it. For all I know he manned the craft-services table as well. Antonio Banderas coiffed in a handsome silky-long outlaw style (he should be required to wear his hair this way all the time) is the gunslinger-guitarist hero who is less a character than a walking spirit and Johnny Depp is a casually corrupt CIA agent who keeps turning up in assorted disguises. These two provide a hit of marquee wattage yet ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"" in its wildly overwrought burrito-Western way is about as close to a home movie as youre likely to see in a megaplex. Rodriguez going gonzo at the chopping table creates some indulgently exciting action scenes. He loves to ride the camera along the ground like a stunt vehicle snaking up to someone whos holding a very big gun and then splinter the images like shrapnel. Mostly though he careers from one intrigue to the next like a comic-book visionary high on tequila. He has made a dense jangled quasi-coherent fantasy of conspiracy and doom in which everyone on screen is trying to stab everyone else in the back. In filmmaking there may be limits as well as a spark of glory to doing everything yourself. The joy that Rodriguez takes in each shot is palpable yet it often feels as if he made up the movie on the spot. Banderas Mariachi with his viva-my-dark-eyes smolder of proletarian pride is out to redeem the honor of Mexico by sabotaging a pair of villains the fascist General Marquez (Gerardo Vigil) who is about to stage a coup and Barillo (Willem Dafoe) a drug-cartel boss with an ugly pencil mustache who is only too happy to help him do it. There are subplots involving grisly plastic surgery the lack of interagency cooperation between the CIA and the FBI and the Mariachis long-ago romance with a sultry senorita played by Salma Hayek - a back story that for no good reason doesnt quite line up with the one in ""Desperado."" Depp speaking in amused tones of sarcastic indifference is Sands the representative of American power who manipulates the action. Depps performance with its winking grace notes of Brandoesque flakery (Sands is obsessed with sampling the same pulled-pork dish in every chintzy bar) is as minimal and laid-back as his ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" turn was deep-dish theatrical. Yet here as well he evinces a relish for the role of the caustic outsider - the perfect stance for a born star who wont commit himself to stardom. The title with its allusion to the films of Sergio Leone is in a sense a justification for Rodriguezs voluptuous slipshod style. Leones spaghetti Westerns are now praised as genre masterpieces yet their tantalizing iconography - the shoot-outs suspended in time the looming closeups of gunslingers faces the Ennio Morricone music that made it all work - was always surrounded by a fair amount of lazy and inflated filmmaking. They were epic B movies gone hallucinogenic and they expressed and made rapturous the stoned spirit of the late 60s. ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"" too taps the pulp dynamic of its time which is zappy fragmentary action layered on top of too much information. Its pop filmmaking at its headiest maybe because it never quite gets outside the filmmakers head.

Resurrecting the gun-slinging guitar player for the third time after ""El Mariachi"" and ""Desperado"" the new entry inhabits a more epic dimension evokes the mythic feel of Sergio Leone Westerns. Cutting loose between ""Spy Kids"" assignments Robert Rodriguez returns to his genre roots -- albeit with greater technical means and an A-list cast -- in ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico."" Resurrecting the gun-slinging guitar player for the third time after ""El Mariachi"" and ""Desperado"" the new entry inhabits a more epic dimension and -- as the title suggests -- evokes the mythic feel of Sergio Leone Westerns. Despite a convoluted plot that begs for cleaner lines the wild shoot-outs cartoonish violence and charismatic cast should lure action fans to theaters in significant numbers followed by rowdy home entertainment trade. Fact that the multihyphenate filmmaker is clearly having fun here is underlined by credits like ""shot chopped and scored by Robert Rodriguez."" In addition to those duties and to writing and directing Rodriguez also served as production designer re-recording mixer and visual effects supervisor with much of the post-production carried out at the directors Troublemaker facilities in Austin Texas. Made on a modest budget and displaying a refined version of the technical resourcefulness that first put Rodriguez on the map with the 7000 ""El Mariachi"" the new pic also serves as a testament to the advancements in visual quality of digital video. Shot with Sony 24-frames-per-second digital high-definition cameras and almost indiscernibly blown up to widescreen 35mm the film has remarkable visual depth and clarity not to mention rich scorching color. Setting the tone in a larger-than-life register that mixes reality with fantasy an amusing pre-titles sequence re-introduces both the singing pistolero (Antonio Banderas) and his sultry inamorata Carolina (Salma Hayek) in a bloody clash with a crew of villainous scum as retold with embellishments by Belini (Cheech Marin) to rogue CIA agent Sands (Johnny Depp). Belini reveals that el Mariachis chief adversary General Marquez (Gerardo Vigil) did not die in the fight but lives on. The story picks up on the guitar player living in isolation smoldering with psychological scars after the murder of Carolina and their daughter. A romantic back-story is patched together through memory sequences. El Mariachi enlists help from his crooning sidekicks (Enrique Iglesias Marco Leonardi) after he is recruited by Sands to intervene in a coup detat. Plot is being orchestrated by General Marquez and cartel kingpin Barrillo (Willem Dafoe) who plan to assassinate the Mexican president (Pedro Armendariz Jr.) during the Day of the Dead celebrations. Barrillo also has a price on el Mariachis head. An elaborate web of double-crossing and deceit gradually emerges as Sands begins playing off various elements against each other. Lack of focus and delineation in the overburdened messy plot is exacerbated by the blur between Marquez and Barrillo as key villains and by the latters poorly illustrated scheme to kill off a look-alike and start fresh with a surgically altered face. The backdrop of impending revolution also is unsatisfyingly sketched as is Barrillos double role as vicious murdering drug lord and friend-to-the-people folk hero. And affable as they are el Mariachis sidekicks also serve no real purpose though music chart heartthrob Iglesias makes a respectable screen bow. Far more effective are the digressions to recap the Mariachis relationship with Carolina which expand on the seed of the earlier movies and lend breadth and soulfulness to this final installment. And one scene in particular involving the sexy couples escape from a fifth-floor hotel room while chained together is arguably the most exciting of the pics many action sequences. Rodriguez knowingly uses Banderas as an iconic figure given to few words strutting through gunbattles more like a flamenco dancer than a killer. Hayek makes a ballsy impression in her fleeting appearances but other cast members appear to be along for the joyride with little time to flesh out fully developed characters. Main exception is Depp who follows his enormously enjoyable work in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" with another inventive turn finding the sly comedy and even an unexpected paternal side behind his characters cool cruelty. Rodriguezs muscular camerawork is matched by his exhilarating editing -- especially during the visceral gunplay set pieces -- and backed by his driving score which blends Mexican guitar themes with suspenseful Latino orchestral work. Production design also is sharp making good use of dusty locations rustic bars and classic Mexican architecture.
