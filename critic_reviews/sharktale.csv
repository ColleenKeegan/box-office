Story is everything and Sharks is rather thin and soupy despite the winning improvisational skills of stars Will Smith and Jack Black. Deep in conversation Oscar (Will Smith) works the phone at the whale wash where he works with Angie (Renee Zellweger) in Shark Tale. Dreamworks We havent seen a shark as likable and warmhearted as Blacks Lenny since well the recovering carnivores in Finding Nemo. The comparison to that other seaborne computer-animated hit is inevitable -- and unfortunate for DreamWorks because Disney/Pixars Nemo is one of the more beloved family films in recent history. Shark Tales world is grittier less dazzling and not as beautiful as Nemos But this is a decidedly more urban tale complete with gangsters groupies and graffiti artists. It may be make-believe but its not a visual escape from reality. At the top of the heap is the godfather of the reef Don Lino (a great name for a character voiced by Robert De Niro) who happens to be Lennys imperious father. Don Linos other son is Frankie played by Michael Imperioli of The Sopranos fame. Hes the don-in-training. Don Lino doesnt know what to make of tenderhearted Lenny a closet vegetarian. One of the movies most appealing aspects is its message about embracing differences among those in our families and community. About the movie Shark Tale   1/2 (out of four) Stars Will Smith Jack Black Renee Zellweger Robert De Niro Directors Vicky Jenson Bibo Bergeron Rob Letterman Distributor Dreamworks Rated PG for some mild language and crude humor Opens Friday nationwide The story also deals with the proverbial little fish in a big pond. Oscar (an inventive and funny Smith) is a small-time amphibian who works at the local whale wash cleaning the gaping jaws of those behemoth mammals. The role was designed with Smith in mind and he appears to be having a blast voicing it. By a chance turn of events Oscar is mistaken for a brazen ""shark slayer"" so he takes the misconception and swims with it. Suddenly Oscars ordinary existence morphs into that of a sea-lebrity. Lenny the gentle giant of a shark is in on the deception but Oscar casts aside his faithful angelfish pal Angie (Renee Zellweger) who has a secret crush on him. He takes up with Lola (Angelina Jolie) the alluring ""fish fatale"" who is drawn by Oscars newfound fame though she had no use for him before. She spouts one of the funniest lines of the movie ""Deep down Im really shallow."" Some of the best characters are Sykes Martin Scorseses pufferfish who has the directors thick dark eyebrows and Sykes dreadlocked pair of henchmen Rastafarian jellyfish Reefers (theres a little joke for the parents) called Bernie and Ernie (Ziggy Marley and Doug E. Doug). Too bad Shark Tale as a whole doesnt offer the freshness of some of those creations. The movie has a familiar quality yet seems to be missing some of the magic of DreamWorks last exceptional animated efforts Shrek and its sequel. The beauty of Shrek and Finding Nemo is that the characters are so delightful and their quests so captivating we forget we are watching animated creatures. Shark Tale doesnt offer a thrilling odyssey or such indelible characters. Its a pleasant diversion but not one with lasting resonance.

DOUG and ZIGGY MARLEY) in DreamWorks Animations computer-animated comedy ... more Mouthy little fish yearns to be big fish in an ocean awash with movie in-jokes and mobsters 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Shark Tale Animation comedy. Starring voices of Will Smith Robert De Niro Jack Black and Renee Zellweger. Directed by Rob Letterman. (PG. 90 minutes. At Bay Areatheaters.) ""Shark Tale"" is an animated Mafia spoof set under the sea with a cast of fish -- in other words a really bad idea. Or so it would seem. But somehow by avoiding the usual animation cliches by keeping the story moving the pictures pretty and the characters consistently amusing director and co- writer Rob Letterman cobbles together an entertaining 90 minutes. Like the first ""Shrek"" ""Shark Tale"" is animation for cynics. Its a movie bereft of the main filmmaking virtues (such as passion the need to tell a story the need to say something) but with enough secondary virtues to pick up the slack Cleverness a strong cast and a director with an eye on the clock. A lot of the jokes are in-jokes but theyre funny and theres a decent story as well about a small fish who wants to become a big fish and tells a whopper of a lie. There are two main characters in ""Shark Tale"" and the key to the movies success is that it concentrates on the right one. Theres Lenny a gentle vegetarian shark voiced by Jack Black and theres Oscar a little fish who wants to be a big shot (the voice of Will Smith). A focus on Lenny might have tilted the tone in a poignant direction. Instead the picture hones in on Oscar a hustler wholl do anything to get ahead and who hates his job as a tongue scrubber in a whale-washing shop. Oscar feels like a nobody. He keeps saying that hes a nobody and the story endorses that point of view. (Its a heck of a message for a movie to be pumping into the minds of children that a hard-working guy is a bum. But its par for the course in an era in which fame is prized above all things.) In love with Oscar is an angel fish voiced by Renee Zellweger but Oscar is too busy running from loan sharks to notice her. Lennys story brings in the Mafia element. Hes son of the local mob boss Don Lino (Robert De Niro) who is disconcerted that Lenny refuses to be a killer and wont eat anybody. This is in contrast to Lennys brother Frankie a carnivore from way back. Frankie is played by Michael Imperioli best known as Christopher on ""The Sopranos."" Vincent Pastore another ""Sopranos"" veteran plays Don Linos dim-witted adviser  an octopus named Luca. If all this sounds asinine well I wouldnt attempt to defend the concept. What cant come across in a story description is the shimmering lavender and violet color palette and the freedom of the animation. Theres depth of field. Theres panning within the frame. Individual characters have distinct facial expressions and so one feels as though ones watching not pictures but performances. When Don Lino scowls his lips compress in a way that looks like De Niro at least if De Niro were a shark. This is funny. Im not saying its a scream but its enough to get you to the next moment. A blowfish voiced by Martin Scorsese who is known for his nervous staccato speaking style has thick eyebrows like Scorsese and some of his mannerisms. And Oscar looks a little like Smith too. These are visual in-jokes and the script is loaded with spoken in-jokes as well some of them fairly obscure. For example when Oscar who has falsely advertised himself as a ""shark slayer"" finds himself about to fight a shark the crowd goes into an African chant last heard at the Ali-Foreman bout 30 years ago. Kids wont catch that reference but then kids wont catch the Mafia movie references either or realize that the line ""You had me at hello  "" was originally said in another film. What kids will grasp is the underdogs story and theyll enjoy the exuberance and the spectacle. If kids somehow miss the point of ""Shark Tale"" that lying to get ahead has a way of working out in the end all the better. In any case its hard to complain about an animated films cynical worldview when its precisely that cynicism that makes it capable of surprising -- and amusing -- adults.

"Charmless and insulting Shark lacks biting wit - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Charmless and insulting Shark lacks biting wit By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  October 1 2004 The marketing campaign leading up to ""Shark Tale"" Dreamworks new grab for your childs mindshare -- sorry Dreamworks new digitally animated entertainment -- seems more relentless than usual. There are TV spots Burger King toys video games across all platforms and if Im not mistaken the great white shark seen swimming off Naushon Island has the studio logo tattooed on its fin. Maybe the folks who gave us ""Shrek"" want to avoid confusion with a certain Oscar-winning Pixar movie set under the sea. Or perhaps they want to build on it; I recently overheard a child ask his mother ""Is that the sequel to `Finding Nemo?""No kid its not -- its ""Finding Nemo"" gutted of all its charm and remixed for urban hit radio. ""Shark Tale"" is a film calculated to give us a good time and its the calculation that spoils the fun. Where ""Nemo"" was clever soulful and marvelous to look at ""Tale"" is manic and surprisingly ugly with a script that leans on the shallowest aspects of hip-hop street cred while pimping for corporate product placement at every turn. Yes your children will probably enjoy it but do you really want to feed them more of the throwaway crud culture they get every single day?The settings an ocean reef made over to look like a submerged Times Square complete with a red-and-white ""Coral Cola"" billboard and live news feed featuring Katie Current (voiced by Katie Couric). Will Smith lends his rubbery vocal talents to the role of Oscar a lowly employee at a whale-wash run by a pufferfish named Sykes (filmmaker Martin Scorsese dithering amusingly). A schemer who dreams of making it rich and living in gold-chained glory ""at the top of the reef"" Oscar is too starry-eyed to see that fellow employee Angie (Renee Zellweger) is in love with him.Instead Oscar bets a wad on a seahorse race and loses ending up in the hole to Sykess bosses a shark mob overseen by Don Lino (Robert De Niro). The Don has two sons tough-guy Frankie (Michael Imperioli Christafuh from ""The Sopranos"" himself) and wimpy vegetarian embarrassment Lenny (Jack Black). Through a ""Brave Little Tailor""-style misunderstanding Oscar becomes renowned throughout the reef as ""The Shark Slayer"" all the while hiding Lenny from his family and the rest of the fish population.A couple of Italian-American organizations the Columbus Citizens Foundation and the Order Sons of Italy in America have publicly censured Dreamworks for rolling out the old mobster stereotypes in ""Shark Tale."" Thats the least of the films problems. Personally Id think African-American audiences would be insulted by the way ""Tale"" presents Oscar as a slick obnoxious cartoon ""playa."" Parents might be put off by the gang of adorable little-kid fishes who run around tagging graffiti on the walls (excellent role modeling Dreamworks). And everyone should be properly creeped out by the corporate logos all over the place starting with the bag of Krispy Kremes that lands prominently on Angies desk.The Writers Guild for its part might want to file a protest over a screenplay that substitutes lazy media cross-referencing for actual dialogue. At one moment of shark-killing triumph Oscar says in succession ""Are you not entertained? You cant handle the truth You had me at `Hello "" and were supposed to surmise -- what? That the writers have seen the same movies we have? ""Shark Tale"" takes the punning pop-culture-crazy wit of ""Shrek"" and dumbs it down until its just another way to sell and the only upside is that the whole thing will be out of date by Christmas.Smith overdoes his role but the rest of the all-star cast is fine and there are individual laughs to be had like atolls in a barren stretch of ocean. Sykess henchmen two Rasta jellyfish played by Doug E. Doug and Ziggy Marley are the offbeat highlight of the film even if its possible from under water to hear Marleys dad rolling in his grave. Its also cute that many characters share physical attributes with the actors voicing them -- De Niros mole Scorseses eyebrows Smiths ears (morphed into fins here). This still doesnt keep them from looking like creepy little mutants. Angelina Jolies supposedly va-va-va-voom vamp Lola is one scary piece of sushi and the appearance of Missy Elliott and Christina Aguilera as singing fish during the end credits may have put me off seafood for good.The marquee value alone will probably make the film a hit but ""Shark Tale"" is an ick-thyological experience nevertheless. Its a movie so instantly disposable you could wrap it in yesterdays newspaper. Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. A Sharks Tale1/2 (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

DreamWorks animated movie gives us Don Lino a great white shark as voiced by Robert De Niro; and Sykes his sidekick a puffer fish who fills up with air when hes upset -- this character courtesy of rat-a-tat chatterbox Martin Scorsese. Don head of the sharks and ruler of the reef in this undersea world is worried about his favored son Lenny (Jack Black) who doesnt take well to the shark life. Hes a pacifist. Hates icing other fish. His idea of a good meal? Sea vegetation. Don dispatches his tough oldest son Frankie (Michael Imperioli of ""The Sopranos"") to give Lenny some killer instinct. ""Shark Tale"" a little fish in a big pond of far superior CGI films features Will Smith (Oscar) left Jack Black (Lenny) and Renee Zellweger (Angie).

Through a comedy of errors the jive-talking Oscar gets credited for the killing and is hailed as the legendary Sharkslayer. Oscars not about to set the record straight. And he persuades the reluctant Lenny who saved him from Frankie in the first place to help continue his undeserved legend. Trouble is the whole reef expects Oscar to take care of every shark that floats through. He needs Lenny for that too. Success also forces Oscar to choose romantically between angelfish gal pal Angie (Renee Zellweger) who has always loved him and va-va-voom fish Lola (Angelina Jolie) who just loves a winner. ""Shark Tale"" isnt any trouble to sit through. But in a way thats a problem. It neglects the opportunity to go deeper into originality and after a while those incessant sea puns and the mafioso shtick wear pretty thin. (The ill-advised trite depiction of Italian Americans as mafia types has already elicited a little turbulence in politically correct waters.) Despite some peppy improvisational moments between Scorsese and De Niro not to mention Smiths sitcom-honed love-me-love-me performance as Oscar ""Shark Tale"" feels borrowed sampled and dittoed from the collective funniness of the past 10 years in studio-made animation. Even the relatively amusing performances by Doug E. Doug and Ziggy Marley as Bernie and Ernie two Rastafarian jellyfish smack a little too much of Sebastian the Caribbean crustacean in Walt Disneys ""The Little Mermaid."" The movies familiarity probably wont register as anything but fun to most kids. But that vapor of mediocrity might penetrate more discerning nostrils. Many of us have grown accustomed to extremely high quality in the computer-animated genre thanks to such great films as ""Toy Story"" and ""Shrek."" This movie just doesnt match its predecessors and those inevitable comparisons to Disneys ""Finding Nemo"" will leave ""Shark Tale"" foundering. The Disney film is far more seaworthy particularly for its comic writing and story which makes it hard to imagine ""Shark Tales"" theatrical run yielding as much box office as the DVD release -- that lucrative consolation prize for many a so-so project. SHARK TALE (PG 92 minutes) -- Contains mild obscenity and crude humor. Area theaters.

"Shark Tale | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; shark-tale ) Shark Tale (United States 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli The first salvo in the battle of the would-be autumn family blockbusters has been fired by Dreamworks. Beating The Incredibles to the screen by more than a month Shark Tale represents the fourth digitally animated feature to come from the studio (following Antz Shrek and Shrek 2). Over the past few years animation companies (Dreamworks and Pixar in particular) have worked to refine a formula for digital animation. Its a lot like Disneys defunct conventional one make the story simple but add some adult shadings; use a talented voice cast; incorporate comedy romance and action; throw in a few songs and pop references; and make the protagonist an underdog. By following this formula and doing so in an energetic and infectious manner Shark Tale has virtually assured itself a successful box office run. Nows the time for me to make the obligatory comment about how this movie will appeal equally to viewers of all ages. Adults will see Shark Tale on a different level than their offspring (and will get a lot more of the throw-away gags and visual jokes) but both will enjoy it. The quality of the animation is something everyone will agree is top-notch which is unsurprising considering the other animated projects Dreamworks has been associated with. The undersea world is rendered differently here than in Finding Nemo but is no less impressive. Shark Tale views Neptunes Kingdom as an aquatic New York City and this leads to a lot of fun references - you can pass a ""Prawn Shop"" on your way to watching news reports by ""Katie Current"" on the equivalent of the Times Square giant video screen. (The voice of Katie Current by the way is provided by Katie Couric unless youre in Australia. Then its that of local celeb Tracey Grimshaw.) The mafia shark family consists of Don Lino (voice of Robert De Niro) and his sons Frankie (Michael Imperioli) and Lenny (Jack Black). Frankie has inherited his fathers love of violence but Lenny is a sweetheart - and a vegetarian to boot. Enter Oscar the wrasse (Will Smith) a worker at the Whale Wash which is owned by the puffer fish Sykes (Martin Scorsese). After wandering into shark territory Oscar has to flee from an enraged Frankie. An accident results in Frankies death but Oscar takes the credit and is re-dubbed by the fish community as the ""Shark Slayer."" As Oscars popularity skyrockets two female fish vie for his affections the sexy Lola (Angelina Jolie) and the steady Angie (Renee Zellweger) who has swum by his side for years. The best material in Shark Tale involves Don Lino and Sykes. The De Niro/Scorsese dialogue will be most amusing to adults since theyll get the sly references. They will also recognize the significance of the mole on Don Linos face and Sykes bushy eyebrows. Will Smith is perhaps a little too high energy as Oscar. Listening to him do his shtick is a little exhausting. I kept reflecting about how much better Eddie Murphy was in Shrek precisely because he was in a secondary part. Had Lenny been elevated to the main character with Oscar playing the wise-cracking sidekick things might have been more relaxed. (Even though Jack Black is known for being manic Lenny is surprisingly mellow despite his neuroses.) When it comes to the new genre of digitally animated films Shark Tale falls around the middle (still an enviable place to be considering the high quality of most of the entrees). Its not as good as Shrek the Toy Story movies or Finding Nemo but its better than Ice Age and Shrek 2. I would place it on about the same level as Monsters Inc.. The key thing to note is that Shark Tale represents solid family entertainment and will find a special place in the hearts of those who adore the Godfather movies and the TV series ""The Sopranos.""

YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Review Renee Zellweger Will Smith Jack Black or Create your own Manage alerts | What is this? LOS ANGELES California (CNN) -- ""Shark Tale"" is a fine kettle of fish that should be irresistible to anyone who loves movies while also offering some interesting subtext giving the feature an extra little bite.(Sorry couldnt resist.)The film stars -- albeit only vocally -- Will Smith Jack Black Angelina Jolie Renee Zellweger Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese (the latter in a rare acting gig) all of whom do a fine job. For ""Shark Tale"" De Niro and Scorsese were actually in the recording studio at the same time allowing them to ad-lib many of their lines. The same was true of Smith and Black. Actors actually meeting each other let alone performing together is a rarity during the long process of making an animated film which makes this project a true piece of animated film history.The result is a delightful delicious and fresh pop culture comedy.""Shark Tale"" directed by Vicky Jenson (""Shrek"") Bibo Bergeron (""The Road to El Dorado"") and Rob Letterman (in his directing debut) contains two main storylines.One subplot revolves around Oscar (Smith) a small fast-talking fish with large dreams of making it to the big time at the top of the reef. In the meantime he must be content being a tongue cleaner at the local Whale Wash. His co-worker Angel (Zellweger) is secretly in love with him but cant get him to stop harping on his dreams long enough to see what is right in front of him an honest job and a girl who loves him.Fishy doingsOne day while swimming through the reef Oscar is a witness to the accidental death of a shark. He takes credit for the sharks early demise and becomes an instant hero known as Oscar the sharkslayer. He becomes trapped in his own lie and attracts the attentions of an opportunistic puffer fish Sykes (Scorsese) and of a gold-digging vamp Lola (Jolie).The secondary story is about the mob family of sharks who control the reef. De Niro -- who else -- plays Don Lino the head of the family. Hes preparing his two sons Frankie (who is played by Michael Imperioli best known as Tony Sopranos nephew Christopher in ""The Sopranos"") and Lenny (Black) to take over the family business. Martin Scorsese provides the voice for the slick Sykes.Frankie is a chip off the ol fish stick and therefore the perfect heir. However younger brother Lenny is an extremely sensitive soul who is a closet vegetarian. Its Frankie who is killed accidentally the act which makes Oscar a hero. Lenny fearing his fathers expectations now that he is the only remaining son runs off with Oscar and pretends to be a dolphin by painting himself blue and changing the shape of his snout.The stage is now set for learning all the life lessons found in a film like this. Lennys being a vegetarian could be a metaphor for any type of outsider. But what is blatantly obvious -- at least to this reviewer -- is that Lennys ""otherness"" could also very easily be read as being gay. When posing as a gentle dolphin Lenny sports a flamboyant neck scarf  and his overall demeanor is as subtle as a rainbow flag at the Republican convention. This thinly veiled subtext makes Lennys eventual acceptance all the more poignant.Filled with charmAs with any film casting is key but with an animated film it becomes even more vital since the actors have only their voices to establish their characters personalities. With ""Shark Tale"" the casting is perfect and the choices are all the more delightful since the main players are all new to the world of animation.Overall the animation is not of the same quality as that in ""Finding Nemo"" and the film may not go down as a classic but its a highly entertaining swim among a lot of very endearing characters and provides plenty of laughter.""Shark Tale"" manages to work both as a charming story on its own while also being a great send-up of the classic mob film genre -- making it a great catch for the entire family.""Shark Tale"" opens Friday October 1 and is rated PG.Story Tools Subscribe to Time for 1.99 Review Perfect Man fatally flawed CNN/Money What TVs most popular dads earn Poll Most prefer to watch movies at home Cruise Holmes engaged to marryCNN/Money Security alert issued for 40 million credit cards Bin Laden deputy sends message U.S. House votes to keep U.N. dues Iran poll to go to run-off ALL AL AK AZ AR CA CO CT DE DC FL GA HI ID IL IN IA KS KY LA ME MD MA MI MN MS MO MT NE NV NH NJ NM NY NC ND OH OK OR PA RI SC SD TN TX UT VT VA WA WV WI WY International Edition Languages --------- Arabic German Japanese Korean Turkish CNN TV CNN International Headline News Transcripts Advertise With Us About Us SEARCH The Web CNN.com (c) 2005 Cable News Network LP LLLP.

Built-in kid audience and the first-rate cast will assure some good initial returns but the odor around this one will result in the wrong kind of B.O. The fish arent fresh in ""Shark Tale."" In the era when with ""Finding Nemo"" and ""SpongeBob Square Pants"" it has seemed all but impossible to miss with underwater cartoon fare DreamWorks latest inhouse animated effort finds a way to do just that by basing almost all its ideas on old movies. Built-in kid audience and the first-rate cast will assure some good initial returns but the odor around this one will result in the wrong kind of B.O. for what was obviously intended as a blockbuster follow-up to the studios summer smash ""Shrek 2."" Anyone who felt there was a bit too much product placement and cinematic in-joking in ""Shrek 2"" will recoil at this crass outing the setting of which looks like a waterlogged version of Times Square or CityWalk. Overfamiliarity extends to the story jokes and music most of which reference popular entertainment of about 30 years ago. The heavily commercial and uncharming environs known as the Reef are under siege by Great White sharks headed by the godfather himself Don Lino (Robert De Niro). Lino whose headquarters are in the ruins of the Titanic has one son Frankie (Michael Imperioli) whos a proper goodfella but another Lenny (Jack Black) who these days would be considered a girlie-shark; in a prominent idea straight out of ""Nemo"" Lenny is a vegetarian and just plain ""different"" far too sensitive for a dad like Lino. One shark mob subordinate is Sykes (Martin Scorsese) a puffer fish who operates a Reef whale wash where raucous dreamer Oscar (Will Smith) works. Physically unprepossessing and so full of hot air he should be a puffer fish too Oscar tries to romance sweet co-worker Angie (Renee Zellweger) when hes not spinning his grandiose plans he hopes will make him a ""somebody."" But just as accidentally as Dorothy became a witch killer in ""The Wizard of Oz"" little Oscar becomes reknowned as the ""Shark Slayer"" when inaccurate word gets out that he single-handedly dispatched No. 1 son Frankie. Raucously welcomed back at the Reef Oscar embraces his new-found celebrity and is tempted by the uptown sweetlife and favors offered by temptress Lola (Angelina Jolie). Climax emerges as pics best scene with Don Lino presiding over a mob ""sit-down"" that will decide the fate of Oscar Lenny and the rest. Standard toon message of tolerance for all winds things up on a note no more surprising than anything thats preceded it. Main accomplishment of the script by Michael J. Wilson (""Ice Age"") and Rob Letterman is that someone finally found a way to merge elements of two of the biggest hits of the 70s ""The Godfather"" and ""Jaws"" into one story with a dash of ""Car Wash"" thrown in for good measure. Letterman co-directed with Vicky Jenson one of the directors of ""Shrek"" and Bibo Bergeron (""The Road to El Dorado"") with visual clarity but little of the wit and imagination that graces the most popular contempo animated films. As voiced by Smith Oscars hyper-active jive-talking hustler proves a tiresomely familiar figure and Zellwegers love interest is entirely uninteresting. Shark dialogue has more character with De Niros delivery nicely matching facial expressions for Lino. Curiously the most amusing vocal performance may come from De Niros old cohort Scorsese who machine guns his dialogue and whose puffer fish is even drawn with the directors trademark thick eyebrows. With the combination of mobster characters and heavily Ramp;B hip-hop and disco/soul tune orientation of the soundtrack pic has a more streetwise feel than most animated fare which is not to say that it has street smarts.
