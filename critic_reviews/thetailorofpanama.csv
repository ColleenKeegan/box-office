"TIME.com Short Takes <a href=""http//ar.atwola.com/link/93163710/aol""> </a> [an error occurred while processing this directive] Articles Since 1923 Current Issue Past 30 Days -Top Searches- Iraq George W. Bush U.S. Military al-Qaeda Osama bin Laden gt; Advanced Search Short Takes B O O K S SEABISCUIT By Laura Hillenbrand Never was there so unlikely a horse-racing champion as Seabiscuit. He was undersize injury prone had a flayed foreleg and a broken-boned one-eyed jockey. Yet thanks to a gifted trainer Seabiscuit topped his career by beating War Admiral in a sensational meeting in 1938. Hillenbrands prose is often breathless and overwrought but readers should ride this one to the wire. BY JESSE BIRNBAUM C I N E M A THE TAILOR OF PANAMA Directed by John Boorman Pierce Brosnans Andy Osnard is the anti-Bond--a cold cynic in need of a revolution to revive his career as a secret agent. Geoffrey Rush is the anti-hero creating an imaginary insurgency out of the rumors he picks up while fitting bespoke clothing in his elite near bankrupt shop. Theres a nice irony in the way their needs feed each other but the movie works it too hard and when the revolution turns real the film finally collapses under the burden of implausibility. BY RICHARD SCHICKEL THE WIDOW OF SAINT-PIERRE Directed by Patrice Leconte The French word veuve (widow) also means guillotine. In 1850 a killer (Emir Kusturica) is condemned to death by guillotine on an island where there is no such device; the local captain (Daniel Auteuil) must send away for one. Meanwhile the killer ingratiates himself with the townsfolk especially the captains wife (Juliette Binoche). Issues of life and death love and friendship play out delicately and powerfully. Binoche is especially subtle and radiant in another splendid drama from Leconte. BY RICHARD CORLISS T E L E V I S I O N WHAT ABOUT JOAN ABC TUESDAYS 930 P.M. E.T.; MY WIFE AND KIDS ABC WEDNESDAYS 8 P.M. E.T. Bette may be gone but the star-vehicle sitcom train of 2000-01 sputters on. The always adorable Joan Cusack is betrayed by the relationship comedy Joan which cranks up her neurotic cuteness to clinically diagnosable levels and plays a little like a live-action version of Cathy. Damon Wayans fares better as a besieged patriarch in Wife but it too visibly strains to be a 21st century Cosby Show less because of the bourgie African-American milieu than because of the tiredly wisecracking Huxtabilitude it shoehorns the acerbic Wayans into. BY JAMES PONIEWOZIK T H E A T E R A CLASS ACT Music and lyrics by Edward Kleban This Broadway tribute to the lyricist of A Chorus Line who never had another hit and died of cancer in 1988 might seem a precious bit of Broadway navel gazing. Yet it is surprisingly fresh and engaging. Klebans little-heard songs are witty and original--Sondheim without the thesaurus. And the creators (chiefly director and star Lonny Price) temper their affection with candor and insight into an artist more familiar with frustration than fame.

Starring Pierce Brosnan Geoffrey Rush and Jamie Lee Curtis. Directed by John Boorman. (R. 109 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) . . Alert moviegoers can catch their first glimpse of Daniel Radcliffe the young English actor who will play Harry Potter in the new Pierce Brosnan spy thriller ""The Tailor of Panama."" Brosnan is once again a British M16 agent but not the one audiences are accustomed to seeing. This time he has a license to distance himself as far as possible from James Bond. As Andy Osnard new to Panama but not to steamy intrigue Brosnan is nasty arch cynical and languorous but not above blackmail whoring or double-dealing. Brosnan the actor is as dangerously fascinating to watch as a cobra. This is a Brosnan we have never seen before showing a sudden vicious streak or an ugly laugh. He would make a terrific villain in the next Bond movie if the Cubby Broccoli heirs want to double cast him as 007s evil twin. Geoffrey Rush plays an expatriate Cockney ex-con now a respectable tailor except for an unfortunate tendency to embroider the truth. Jamie Lee Curtis is his American wife one of the few trustworthy characters in this darkly comic thriller. Young Radcliffe 11 at the time this film was made can be seen in a couple of scenes as their son. Anyone expecting a flashy Bond-style fantasy is going to be disappointed. The film is based on the John Le Carre novel and director John Boorman goes for density -- perhaps at times a little too much. Layer upon layer of intrigue lies and seduction -- sexual and intellectual -- build up. It is also very talky -- fortunately with actors like these and a script by Andrew Davies Boorman and Le Carre himself the talk is frequently good. ""The Tailor"" was filmed in Panama and is about as atmospheric as anybody could wish. The action goes from gilded presidential palace to sultry bordello and except for a perfunctory street carnival or two is effective enough for seekers of the exotic. This ""Tailor"" has a dark thread of comedy too. Brosnan interrogates Rush weirdly on the vibrating bed of the brothel with porno flicks on the TV and later in a gay bar. Brosnan also does something I doubt well ever see James Bond do dance with a man. Harry (Rush) is first seen chalking out a suit pattern on a bolt of cloth. That suit will later show up on the back of one of the highly placed men he cultivates. Rush -- who sometimes seems to have borrowed the Cockney accent from Michael Caine -- makes Harry appear to be a man who knows what he is doing but hes fooled people before and can again. He is after all a former scam artist and still has good reason to cast an anxious eye over his shoulder. One of Boormans nicest touches is to visualize whats going on in Harrys imagination -- his former partner and mentor now dead will materialize to whisper something in his ear. The role is done by English playwright Harold Pinter. Brosnan -- Osnard that is -- is on to Harry and will use him for his own purposes. Osnard presents himself as someone who is in information technology - - ""information is my business."" He has a shady history of his own. He wastes no time seducing any woman who interests him or can be useful to him or both including wives. The reward for the talkiness of the script is getting lines like ""Nobody ever loses their reputation in Panama"" and ""Welcome to Panama -- Casablanca without heroes."" A gossip columnist at a party says ""The more I know the less they print."" One of Harrys friends the burnt-out rebel Mickie well played by Irish actor Brendan Gleeson (""The General"") is described as once the handsomest man in Panama now gone to seed. Like Pavarotti saying he has only so many high Cs and they must be rationed accordingly Mickie says ""You only got so much courage in life. When its gone its spent."" Touchingly to give him back his dignity Harry offers to make him a suit. . Contains nudity profanity and explicit sex.

Andy Osnard A whopper gobbled whole Not a traditional spy flick RELATED SITES By Paul ClintonCNN Reviewer (CNN) -- ""The Tailor of Panama"" teeters from drama to farce to thriller to delicious black comedy and delivers on all fronts. Starring Pierce Brosnan Geoffrey Rush and Jamie Lee Curtis this stylish film is based on a novel of the same name by John le Carre. Its been adapted for the screen by director John Boorman le Carre and Andrew Davies. The movie is set in 1999 during the international controversy over control of the Panama Canal ceded over to to the Panamanian government in an agreement reached in the 1970s by the administration of President Jimmy Carter. Osnard ... Andy Osnard Brosnan turns his James Bond persona inside-out playing Andy Osnard a cynical womanizing (OK no change there) British spy whos been banished to Panama after a series of sexual escapades during his previous assignments -- a spy whos been pushed into the cold you might say. Osnard arrives in the countrys capital Panama City determined to uncover something anything to get his reputation back. After all Osnard figures Panama for years was the worldwide center for money-laundering and drug-dealing Something nasty must be happening somewhere. His plan is to rip open some type of evil can of worms to re-establish his professional name and eventually get out of the spying business altogether. If he happens to make some quick money on the side well so much the better.

(Columbia Pictures) Even when a John Boorman film doesnt completely work its absorbing. Despite a dissatisfying conclusion a sense that things dont completely jell ""The Tailor of Panama"" is lively and provocative. There are several reasons. No. 1 is Boormans one-of-a-kind direction. The filmmaker of ""The General"" ""Hope and Glory"" ""Leo the Last"" and ""Point Blank"" always manages to get in his special licks. Its obvious that theres slightly more to this picture than a mere adaptation of a John Le Carre novel. Andy Osnard (Pierce Brosnan) an agent with the British secret service has been assigned to Panama as some sort of punishment. Getting into trouble with women seems to be the main reason. His job is to get the lay of the land in post-1999 Panama (when the Panama Canal has been restored to the locals) and identify likely candidates for a more democratic West-friendly government. Andy selects Harry Pendel (Geoffrey Rush) a British tailor who makes Savile Row suits for Panamas ruling class as his contact. He figures Harry knows all the gossip and intrigue and starts paying off the tailors debts right away. Through Harry Andy meets an obvious presidential candidate Mickie Abraxas (Brendan Gleeson) a former revolutionary whos not afraid to stand up to Panamas drug-financed powers. Also figuring in the story are Marta (Leonor Varela) Harrys assistant a political radical whose face has been disfigured by the fascist authorities; Francesca (Catherine McCormack) Andys new co-worker at the British Embassy and a prime target for his sexual fun and games; and Louisa Pendel (Jamie Lee Curtis) Harrys wife who becomes justifiably suspicious about Andys motives. The screenplay seems to draw equally from Graham Greenes ""Our Man in Havana"" and the movie ""Casablanca"" with its depiction of a fascist corrupt state in which jaded expatriates commingle with generals at cocktail parties while war (in this case the impending threat of American invasion) rumbles in the background. The ""Havana"" angle kicks in when Harry forced to feed Andy something for all that informant money starts to make up things about a ""Silent Opposition."" London and Washington suddenly prick up their ears. Boorman who scripted this with Le Carre{acute} and Andrew Davis makes ""The Tailor of Panama"" seem like an old-fashioned Hollywood romp along the lines of John Hustons ""Beat the Devil"" where the actors seem to be having something of a busmans holiday playing the characters. Brosnan impishly spreads his wings beyond 007s limited span. What a treat of a cad he is here roguishly seducing women for the sheer hell of it. Clearly he was cast to turn his James Bond persona on its suave ear. Gleeson the stunning star of Boormans underappreciated ""The General"" makes a colorful Falstaffian Panamanian who accidentally becomes Washingtons great hope for the democratic future. And Rush though never a performer to completely win an audiences heart is quite convincing as a tailor caught in political hot water. And to round off the films good points Philippe Rousselots cinematography is fabulous; Panama seems crystalline and sharply etched even its drab slums. With the performers in riotous full swing and the images such a treat for the eyes youre hard-pressed to dislike the movie even when it - like Panama City - goes up in flames. ""The Tailor of Panama"" (R 109 minutes) - Contains obscenity nudity sex scenes and violence.

Pic has class to spare with Pierce Brosnan toplining as a British agent with the superficial charm of 007 but lacking even a trace of moral scruples. This tale of intrigue is not an action-adventure but a film full of wry humor and irony. John Boormans spirited adaptation of John Le Carres 1996 novel ""The Tailor of Panama"" is a stylish sardonic addition to the spy genre. Pic has class to spare with Pierce Brosnan toplining as a British agent with the superficial charm of 007 but lacking even a trace of moral scruples and Geoffrey Rush giving another ace performance as a British resident of Panama who gets caught up in espionage. Columbia will have to position the film carefully in the marketplace however because this post-Cold War tale of intrigue and treachery is not an action-adventure but a film for adults who appreciate the wry humor and irony brought to it by Boorman and Le Carre (who co-scripted and exec produced). There should be sufficient audiences worldwide who will embrace this classy articulate and richly humorous film to make it a mid-range box office success. Casting of Brosnan successful as it is is something of a two-edged sword. On the plus side the actor brings with him evocations of James Bond which since he plays a much less successful and less scrupulous British agent allows for plenty of insider humor. On the down side audiences expecting a Bond-like adventure will be bitterly disappointed. Prologue set in London establishes Brosnans Andy Osnard as a disreputable but charming member of MI6 whose habits of seducing the wives and mistresses of British ambassadors and running up hefty gambling debts hasnt endeared him to his boss (David Hayman). Hes banished to the backwater of Panama and told to check for money laundering and drug trafficking while serving out his time. As lazy as he is opportunistic Osnard immediately decides to sub-contract one of the 200 resident British citizens to feed him the information he requires and settles on snobbish Harry Pendel (Rush). Latters upper-class tailors shop Braithwaite amp; Pendel is a touch of Saville Row in the tropics where anyone who is anyone in Panama gets their suits custom made even if they dont always pay their bills. Harry is happily married to Louisa (Jamie Lee Curtis) an American who works as assistant to the Panamanian director of the canal and hes the father of two delightful children (his son is played by the future screen Harry Potter Daniel Radcliffe). But he is not quite what he seems. Though he claims to have operated a tailors establishment in London with his late partner he in fact has never been anywhere near Saville Row having learned the art of tailoring while in prison for arson. Nevertheless he has the skills and charm to impress the locals providing his customers with the very best. (""That was Mr. Connerys choice"" he notes proudly of a particular piece of cloth one of the films many in-jokes.) But Harry is deeply in debt his investment in a farm proving unwise. So when Osnard dangles the bait of large sums of money in exchange for information about the bankers lawyers and political leaders of the country he eagerly agrees to cooperate. Eventually he starts inventing things to impress Osnard claiming quite falsely that his friend Mickie (Brendan Gleeson) and his assistant Marta (Leonor Varela) both former members of the anti-Noriega resistance are still members of a revolutionary group known as the Silent Opposition. This is duly reported via Osnard back to London and inevitably the demand comes back for even more information. Harry now invents a plan by Panamas leaders to sell the Canal to the highest bidder perhaps China. This revelation sets alarm bells ringing in London and Washington with dramatic results. In mood ""The Tailor of Panama"" is reminiscent of the Graham Greene novels ""The Quiet American"" and especially ""Our Man in Havana"" both of which were filmed in the 1950s. The film is quite caustic in its attitude toward the British and American foreign policy makers who it suggests are inherently suspicious that a small country like Panama can handle the responsibility of the vital canal and dont need much pushing to decide to claim the waterway back. Brosnan brings a rather steely charm to the role of the decidedly untrustworthy Osnard who sets out to make as much money as possible for himself on the side and to seduce every woman who crosses his path. Theres an underlying nastiness to the character that Brosnan subtly conveys. Rush is terrific as Harry a dreamer who doesnt realize what effect his frantic efforts to earn money for his fantastic stories will have on his friends. Curtis is classy as Harrys loving but troubled wife and Catherine McCormack is sultry as an embassy staffer who warms to Osnards seductive charms. Brendan Gleeson so good in the leading role in Boormans previous film ""The General"" is touching as the frequently drunken burnt-out revolutionary Mickie. Supporting cast is fine down the line with Harold Pinter appearing briefly but amusingly as Harrys late partner and still the voice of his conscience. Pic is far more humorous than Le Carres novel. In a stand-out scene Osnard seeking to have a private conversation away from prying eyes and possible bugs forces Harry to dance with him in a gay bar to the music of Irving Berlins ""Lets Face the Music and Dance."" Pic is also full of cinematic references including a couple to ""Casablanca"" and even one to ""The Full Monty."" The ending of the novel has been modified and is now far more upbeat but this doesnt seriously damage the film -- which isnt surprising given the authors strong presence behind the scenes. Boorman is in top form here apparently reveling in the witty material. He has as always been well served by his technical crew. In Philippe Rousselots third film with the director the French d.p.s widescreen photography evocatively explores the rarely used location of Panama with its famous bridge across the canal and its high-rise buildings derisively referred to as ""Laundromats"" because many of them house the countrys 85 banks. Interiors shot at Ardmore Studios in Ireland have been seamlessly integrated.
