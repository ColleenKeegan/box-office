Its not just that the jokes and gags arrive one after another barreling toward the audience with relentless regularity like baseballs from a pitching machine although that certainly helps. For better or for worse the Farrelly brothers who debuted Harry and Lloyds first road-trip comedy two decades ago when I wasnt yet a teenager probably swayed my sense of humor their way with their prodigious (and mega-popular) output during the mid to late 1990s and early 2000s. Even as their hits have become more modest in recent years their influence has spread. Also read Jim Carrey Is Hot for Jeff Daniels Daughter in Dumb and Dumber To Trailer (Video) ""Dumb and Dumber To"" proves a (mostly) pleasant trip down nostalgia lane. The Farrellys feel like jesting uncles you havent seen in awhile who look exactly the same as they ever did. The visuals remain homely and brutally efficient the plot convoluted but the pacing brisk and the humor often inventive and resourceful -- and just as often tired or offensive (to women people of color gays and lesbians old people take your pick). I felt particularly bad for both the elderly Asian actress whose Chinese (or Chinese-sounding babble) was raucously sniggered at by Lloyd and the fairly established 40-something actress asked to lick her co-stars toes. Women remain jiggle-candy or hags to be called out for ugliness in the Farrelly universe. Also read Dumb and Dumber To Is the Smart Choice to Win Weekend Box Office And the brothers still havent learned how to incorporate human emotions into their films. ""Dumb and Dumber To"" begins with Harry (Jeff Daniels) discovering that Lloyd (Jim Carrey) has been faking a coma for the last 20 years as a prank a revelation that leads him to respond ""Awesome"" Though its slightly tested here their loyal friendship has all the emotional resonance of two baboons cackling at the hysterical way the other is scratching its butt. The sequel fares better with the jokes the freshness of which stem from the scripts malapropisms and the central duos well dumbness. When Harry and Lloyd end up at a science and tech conference the latter poses as ""Dr. Christmas"" to gain entry. ""Christmas like the holiday?"" hes asked. ""No like the tree."" Its initially a bit difficult to adjust to the broad-as-a-boulder hyper-exaggerated performances by Daniels and especially Carrey. But their co-dependent rapport which feels picked up directly after the first film quickly draws us in. The overly complicated yet solidly constructed plot lands Harry and Lloyd in another road trip this time searching for Harrys daughter Penny (Rachel Melvin) who may be the kidney match that he desperately needs. The numerous stops and detours which allow the Farrellys to riff on a multitude of scenarios has the two dum-dums running into Pennys mother (Kathleen Turner who suffers any number of insults about her appearance) Pennys adoptive father Dr. Pinchelow (Steve Tom) and the two Pinchelow household members (Rob Riggle and Laurie Holden) who scheme to poison the millionaire patriarch for the inheritance money before doing away with Penny and eventually Harry and Lloyd too. Also read 7 Definitely Not Dumb Things We Learned About Jim Carrey on Howard Stern (Audio) As admirably cohesive as the story is its far surpassed by the wonderfully committed lead performances. Harking back to the rubber-face zaniness of his breakthrough years Carrey elicits childlike wonder at his hyperactive expressions and movements. The comedian strives to entertain during every single second of the film delivering an attention-demanding stunt of a performance that manages to never wear out its welcome. Daniels bridges the gap between Harry and Lloyds aggressive clownishness and some semblance of humanity. The actors participation in this sequel might be read by some as a bird-flip to the Emmy voters who gave him a Best Actor trophy for ""The Newsroom"" this year but hes so hilarious -- and so crucial to the scene when Harry decides to turn on Lloyd for justified reasons -- that it just makes you re-appreciate Daniels extreme versatility. The brothers puerile humor and worldview may occasionally be hard to stomach but ""Dumb and Dumber To"" is a worthy and worthwhile sequel a visit to that optimistic unblemished era when movie comedies had just found a promising new future in Carrey -- and when ""Hall Pass"" was but a glint in the Farrellys eye.

Or maybe Peter and Bobby honed and fussed over the crude humor in the 20 years since Dumb and Dumber introduced Jim Carrey as Lloyd Dunne and Jeff Daniels as his pal Harry Christmas in a display of idiot friendship. That roughhouse farce earned nearly 250 million at the worldwide box office -- about 470 million in todays dollars -- and benefitted from Carreys white-hot stardom; he was on a roll that began with Ace Ventura Pet Detective and The Mask and crescendoed with his roles as The Riddler in Batman Forever (yes that Val Kilmer movie was a hit) and the lawyer in Liar Liar. Carreys manic rubbery verve played nicely against Daniels doofus sluggishness and handed the Farrellys a smash with their first feature. In the intervening two decades the major participants careers have cooled a few kelvins but all are eager to apply the same deranged energy to the sequel from a screenplay by Sean Anders and John Morris. (Their script credits include Shes Out of My League Hot Tub Time Machine Were the Millers and the forthcoming Horrible Bosses 2 so their comedy IQ level is simpatico with the Farrellys.) With Carrey now 52 and Daniels 59 still playing the kind of 12-year-olds whod spend most of their school days in Detention Dumb and Dumber To opens a new trunk of pranks on the old the blind the morbidly obese the physically handicapped and -- the Farrellys primary victims -- the audience. For the 20 years since the first movie Lloyd has been hospitalized in a coma obliging the visiting Harry to change his friends diaper and urostomy bag. Surprise Lloyd is fine and this is his most elaborate prank. Even Harry has to admit ""The shock treatments? The partial lobotomy? That takes commitment."" The Farrellys commitment to stupid human tricks inspires equal awe or dread as Harry searches for a relative to donate the kidney he needs to stay alive. Hearing that he has a daughter Penny (Rachel Melvin) by his long-ago girlfriend Fraida (Kathleen Turner) he and Lloyd visit Pennys adoptive parents and land in the middle of martial intrigue that sends them to El Paso for a Ted-like conference of science geniuses. Cue the Stephen Hawking joke. As an impartial reporter I must mention what I thought were a few good laughs 1. The lads have left their pudgy cat with a blind guy who collects parrots. After devouring them the cat farts bird feathers. 2. Harry riffles through 20 years of old mail opens one letter and says ""I got accepted at Arizona State."" 3. At the funeral home where Fraida works the boys get thirsty and start drinking a blue liquid. Fraida ""Thats embalming fluid"" Lloyd ""Does it have Aspartame?"" Fraida ""No."" So they gulp it down. 4. In his fantasy of fathering Harry is sipping red wine when the 12-year-old Penny appears with evidence of her first menstrual blood. Harry helpfully offers her the wine cork. The richest gag which the Farrellys somehow got the MPAA classification board to participate in is that Dumb and Dumber To is rated PG-13. That means anyone of any age can see the movie unaccompanied by parent guardian or enabler. Which is probably advisable for parents since they then dont have to explain to their kids why Fraidas surname is Felcher or the part of an old ladys anatomy Lloyds hand is probing when she tells him shes stashed a cache of diamonds um between her legs. As Harry observes elsewhere ""Gods got a pretty warped sense of humor."" God and the MPAA. With no children to fret over Im not really concerned if this movie warps their fragile little minds. I just want to laugh and Dumb and Dumber To rarely coaxed me to that state of obscene bliss. Like the Farrellys recent botched attempt to revive the pummeling shenanigans of The Three Stooges this movie breaks not only the canons of etiquette but of how to make people laugh. The usual methods are wit and surprise; the brothers go for aimless charmless shock. That may make them subversive of a high order. Or possibly filmmakers who 20 years on have run out of funny. Stick around for the end of the closing credits and youll find a teaser for ""Dumb and Dumber For -- coming 2034."" Another 20 years till the next one? I can wait.

"From Here to Stupidity The Return of Dumb and Dumber; Plus Some New Not-Bad Sentimental Movies << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com From Here to Stupidity The Return of Dumb and Dumber; Plus Some New Not-Bad Sentimental Movies Universal pictures Movies November 14 2014 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print For most of Dumb and Dumber To I didnt know why any of us were there. The movie wanders toward a plot in which Lloyd (Jim Carrey) and Harry (Jeff Daniels) hit the road to ask Harrys long-lost daughter who had been given up for adoption to give Harry a kidney. There are so many firecracker-type gags that dont go off that its tempting to walk out. Staying is too sad. In the original movie from 20 years ago Carrey had a bowl cut and a cheap newsboy jacket; Daniels wore an electrocuted frizz and a tight striped T-shirt. They were two Muppets terrorizing a live-action world. Now in their fifties (Daniels is 59) wearing the same costumes they seem like mentally ill fugitives from middle age. As it is when this movie starts Lloyd has been catatonic living in a mental institution since the last movie and Harry has been coming by to change his friends diaper. In flashbacks Lloyd lies on a table while Harry yammers on tossing powder between Lloyds hoisted legs the way a TV chef might truss a turkey. The directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly cram the movie with puns and those kinds of sight gags. Almost none of them work. You know that Carrey and the Farrellys can do better because in parts of the first movie and throughout Me Myself amp; Irene they did. This movie is determined to wear down your resistance but its wearying. Having Daniels and two Latin actors playing gardeners yank a catheter out of Carrey might be in the spirit of the original movie but its also an imitation of it. More Awards SeasonAll of our Oscar coverage When the Farrellys are at their best you cant predict where a scene will wind up. They excel at the payoff comedy of well-built gags -- say the visit that Ben Stiller pays to Marys mother and stepfather in Theres Something About Mary that culminates in Stillers being wheeled amid total visual chaos into an ambulance. The editing camerawork and blocking worked in tandem to mine maximal hilarity from personal embarrassment. (This rarely happens in American film comedy now; the formal brilliance has mostly migrated to TV.) Occasionally they can build whole movies on an infectious sense of surprise Mary Irene Stuck on You and their underrated infidelity comedy Hall Pass. Dumber To just has moments. For instance when Harry hunts down his daughters birth mother (Kathleen Turner) who had put the child up for adoption she gives him a letter she had sent to the girl that had been returned the envelope unopened. Harry and Lloyd use the address on it to get from Providence to Maryland. But when they show up on the front steps an exasperated Turner opens the door. You idiots this is the return address. Its a happy stupid surprise that rises to the challenge of finding the least-expected route to the biggest laugh. Whats wrong with Dumber To -- after youve accepted that it was made at all -- is that there isnt enough of that. The movie works only when theres that kind of tension between average people and the two idiots. Mistaking Turner for a man or screaming at a blind guy in a wheelchair isnt funny. Letting an old lady manipulate Lloyd into getting her off is in its nasty way -- but only because the joke with the horny old woman is mostly on Lloyd. When Lloyd and Harry show up finally at the mansion of the long-lost daughters adoptive parents the movie reaches a steadier gear. The plot kicks in and the Farrellys who share writing credit with four other men use it to sharpen the jokes. We arrive at the mansion before Harry and Lloyd do and we can see that Harrys daughter Penny (Rachel Melvin) is a nincompoop too -- but a sexy one. (Harry wants her kidney; Lloyd wants her.) The adoptive family is a collection of types. The father is an oldish ailing Nobel Prize-winning scientist Dr. Pinchelow (Steve Tom). The mother is a film-noir blonde (Laurie Holden) with perfect diction and a plan to knock him off. (Holdens impersonation of a B movie femme fatale is the best thing in the film.) Dr. Pinchelow has dispatched Penny to speak on his behalf at a big TED Talk-like technology conference (KEN plays TED) but she has left behind her phone and the mysterious box he needs delivered. The idiots arrive in time to bring the package to Penny complicating the murder plot. This kind of comedy gets somewhere when the grossness and rudeness and idiocy actually have somewhere to go. Here they go to KEN where Harry is mistaken for Pinchelow and eventually treated like a god. The desperate randomness of the jokes dissipates the farce takes hold and the plot twists about three times. I wish I could say it was all worth it. Dumber To is as much beholden to Billy Wilder and James Thurber and John Waters as are the Farrellys other movies but the prevailing cheapness keeps things much too close to the slovenliness of some Kevin Smith comedies. The original movies release 20 years ago happened at the dawn of a new kind of comedic extremity. Dumb and Dumber along with Ren amp; Stimpy and Beavis and Butt-Head -- scandalous cartoon cable shows -- set a new standard for violent foolish friendships.1 Lloyd and Harry were live-action Looney Tunes. You dont watch a movie like Kingpin or Shallow Hal and think that the men who made it are cool. The Farrellys have an honest geeky curiosity about the true bounds of bad taste. They explore it in movies that feel like old slapstick TV -- The Three Stooges with blood and puke and all kinds of scatological foulness. Whats appalling about them also warrants affection. They like people. The Farrellys are as soft-hearted as they are filthy. Even so Lloyd Christmas and Harry Dunne just werent people you needed to see again. Their return reflects a will in Hollywood and probably in the public to reinvest in Carreys tarnished stardom. Prolonged exposure might have anesthetized us to his brilliance. Hes flailing here swinging hard at every pitch in the script. Daniels gets to be funnier than he did in the first movie. But in the intervening decades he has also become a stronger more textured actor. So the hurt sticks to him and hes crazy enough to play it. The movie just isnt funny enough to make you happy that he bothered. Its made of exactly what flies off of Lloyds hand after he removes it from under that old ladys sheet dust.  Everything about the Farrellys movie is old-fashioned including the kind of mess it is. Its a big moment for corniness at the movies. At the heart of Christopher Nolans Interstellar is the eternally corny notion that love is all you need. But theres nothing inherently wrong with sentimentality or earnestness. It can tip a film into a new or unexpected place. A handful of movies rolling out this weekend are robustly corny and theyre as proud of that as Nolans movie is. If for instance you left Jon Stewarts Rosewater feeling it was made out of duty you wouldnt be wrong. Five years ago the Iranian journalist Maziar Bahari was jailed for being a traitor. The Iranian authorities case against him included his appearance on Stewarts The Daily Show where it was concluded he must have been communicating with an American spy. The film is based on a memoir that Bahari wrote with Aimee Molloy and stars a charm-soaked Gael Garcia Bernal. Its focused largely on the 118 days that Bahari spent imprisoned and interrogated but it is really a work of personal journalism with ripples of comedy and magical realism. Mostly the shifts in tone are muted. Whenever Stewart who wrote the screenplay cracks a joke the mood of solemnity is shattered and youre grateful for the break. The levity feels somehow natural -- not to Stewart per se but to the existential absurdity of the situation. Most of the time the comedy involves Kim Bodnia whos excellent as the blindfolded Baharis fragrant interrogator (the title comes from the heavys scent). The film goes slightly beyond rigorous earnestness and settles into a kind of stubborn atonement. If Stewart feels culpable for Baharis harsh treatment a movie about the consequences of his visit to the show might be the least he felt he could do. But the film is well made and well meaning enough to leave you convinced that Stewart can do even more.  Blackbird Productions/Suzanne Tenner All of the ""more"" in Beyond the Lights comes from the movies belief that the music business preys on womens sexuality until the women dont know who they are anymore. The rising star in Gina Prince-Bythewoods drama is a dancing half-black half-white British singer named Noni (Gugu Mbatha-Raw). Shes been mixed up with a white rapper (Machine Gun Kelly). Her mother (Minnie Driver) has been stage-managing her since her first singing competition. The lack of autonomy nearly sends her over a balcony. Thank goodness that a fine -- and I mean ""foine"" -- LAPD officer (Nate Parker) is there to catch her and pull her up. What ensues is a crowd-pleasing romance between a pair of young black people who together are trying to regain control of their lives (his dad -- Danny Glover -- has pushed him into a campaign for elected office). The story and the concert sequences creak -- theyre part addictive TV drama part Bodyguard redux -- but Prince-Bythewood loves these two people even more than they love each other. She gets them away from the crazy pressures of her mother and the paparazzi and sends them to Mexico where a sexy version of Roman Holiday commences. This leads to a major change in hair and artistic sensibility. Noni goes from Ciara or Aaliyah to Corinne Bailey Rae. Prince-Bythewood has more to say about artistic authenticity than anything in Begin Again; her film is more interesting than it is good. But if ""interesting"" includes 50 alluring close-ups of Parker giving hungry eyes to Mbatha-Raw then ""good"" is overrated.  Roadside Attractions The Homesman could have been great. Its a drama about a homesteader named Mary Bee Cuddy (Hilary Swank) who agrees to transport three mentally ill women (Grace Gummer Miranda Otto and Sonja Richter) from Nebraska to Iowa in a horse-drawn coach with jail bars. The movie has an Oz-like hook. Mary Bee happens upon a hanging man (Tommy Lee Jones) who begs her to cut him down. She does so on the condition that he help her transport these women. Hes a noxious chauvinist. But on they go with assorted bumps -- and parts for Meryl Streep John Lithgow and James Spader -- along the way. I was taken with this arid movie which Jones directs with sugarless confidence. Its Brittle House on the Prairie a tribute to femininity and its misapprehensions. This noble lonely woman feels entitled to companionship and is quietly sour that at 35 and with means she has yet to experience it. Swank continues to be the most guilelessly corny star the movies have. Everything she does is in the service of one shape square. And Jones is smart enough not to overdo any punched-up sentimentality toward her. At this point he must know that the situation is pretty much Pavlovian. Your eyes get wet just looking at her. Jones is good in this film too and youre nervous that hell take it over. But then the plot turns and asks something of Mary Bee that is a complete betrayal of Swanks performance and the radiance she emits. The development probably works in Glendon Swarthouts novel of the same name where Swank is nowhere in sight. But not in the theater. Youre tempted to give up on the movie because it feels as if the movie has given up on her. This column has been updated to correct an error Ben Stillers character in Theres Something About Mary was visiting Marys parents not his own. Quentin Tarantino was operating at the same extremes; Pulp Fiction was also a kind of gross-out comedy.

Along with the relatively highbrow Stepbrothers its the ne plus ultra of moron slapstick the film against which all cretinous child-men assaults on taste must be measured. The spiky manic abrasive Jim Carrey was exquisitely offset by the big schlubby amiable Jeff Daniels and if a few of the gags went thunk (who bats 1000?) there was a lot more art in their construction than the movies slapdash frames suggested. The Farrelly brothers Peter and Bobby turned doofusness into a state of grace. And now theyve turned it back into a state of gracelessness. Wanna read the most annoying sound in the world? AAAEEEEEAAAEIIIIGGHHHHHEEEAAEHH. Its not that they didnt try. This isnt some cynical piece of garbage like Another 48 Hrs. Carrey and Daniels are in there working hard and almost getting their tricky rhythms back. On paper the premise sounds more than serviceable. Harry (Daniels) who desperately needs a kidney transplant discovers a 23-year-old postcard from an old flame telling him shes pregnant with his baby. Said flame Fraida Felcher (Kathleen Turner) tells Harry and Lloyd (Carrey) that she gave the baby up for adoption but has a recent photo; it shows a young woman Penny (Rachel Melvin) who makes Lloyds eyeballs smoke. Lloyd convinces Harry to hit the road in search of Penny -- ostensibly to ask her to donate a kidney but more because Lloyd sees a babe who might finally displace Dumb and Dumbers Mary Swanson. But someone else is after Penny a killer (Rob Riggle) in league with her adopted mom (Laurie Holden) whos slowly poisoning Pennys adopted professor father (Steve Tom) who gives Harry and Lloyd a package for her that might be worth billions of dollars ... The script could have used another draft or two. Harry and Lloyds level of dumb and dumbness keeps shifting; sometimes they sound like sophisticates camping it up -- unfunnily. The old gags arent repeated but the Farrellys constantly invoke them using their first film as an ongoing reference point. ""Blind Billy in 4C"" is all grown up and still loves birds -- with disastrous consequences. We get the second-most-annoying sound in the world. (Whats annoying is how long it takes to get to the punch line.) Lame malapropisms abound ""Shes the fruit of his loom."" Lloyd fantasizes fighting off bad guys to save Penny but its a pale echo of Lauren Hollys bare bum and a throbbing heart pulled out of a ninja warrior and daintily dropped into a doggie bag. Harry puts peanut butter on his dick. Penny turns out to have inherited the Dumb gene and wants to work in a leprechaun colony. Okay that ones not bad (especially when Lloyd says you have to go to Ireland not Africa for that) but I reckon four out of every five jokes played to silence at the preview screening. If Dumb and Dumber To were a live comedian hed have said ""Is this an audience or an oil painting?"" Hed have left the stage in tears. Hed have gone to work in a leprechaun colony. The Farrellys have evidently unlearned what little they knew about staging and composition. (Please understand I revere Dumb and Dumber Theres Something About Mary Shallow Hal and parts of their other movies but stylists theyre never been.) On the far side of the Farrellys agreeable Three Stooges remake its easy to register the Stooges influence on Dumb and Dumber To but the timing is off in almost every scene You either see the joke an instant before it comes so its no surprise or an instant after it passes so you say ""Oh that was a joke ... Gee it stunk."" The key to Lloyd and Harrys characters is that theyre incorrigible pranksters that nothing comes second to hot-footing each other or someone else. But this time we feel more like the hit man played by Mike Starr in Dumb and Dumber. We want to say ""GUYS ENOUGH"" The movies badness could give you an ulcer. And yet ... I came away respecting Carrey whose eyes still glitter under his hideous bowl haircut and Daniels who avidly jumps back into the pigpen. (Daniels might be known for a higher grade of project but he has always credited Dumb and Dumber with keeping his movie career alive and obviously relishes the work.) Kathleen Turner is fearlessly brassy; its a shame shes shot and lighted so poorly that the Farrellys didnt protect her. I didnt watch thinking that Dumb and Dumber To was fated to be a disaster from its conception -- only that comedy is famously hard and this particular effort didnt pay off. Id still get in line for Dumber and Dumbest.

Actually I can think of four people -- writer/directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly and stars Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels. How else to explain their return after two decades to this literally moronic series or a comedy that revolves around idiotic people behaving absolutely idiotically? Apart from pure commercial desperation that is? Actually Daniels -- a small-town boy who has bristled in the past at us snooty big-city critics -- clearly likes clowning around like this occasionally. Ah well. As for the other three though its been a lot longer since they had a hit let alone something (such as Carreys ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"") which suggested a new direction. So back to basics. Very base basics. The plot such as it is reunites the two lifelong friends and then sends them on a road trip. Its too farfetched (and mostly unfunny) to recount but it involves a long-lost daughter a valuable invention a scheming young wife and a couple of assassins. Also as per Farrelly brothers traditions jokes about disabilities violence perpetrated against domestic animals lots of bodily fluids and the sneaking suspicion that -- although the cruel ""R-word"" is never used -- what were really being asked to laugh at are the developmentally disabled. Obviously some will -- some do -- but unlike say the Farrellys ""Theres Something About Mary"" or ""Shallow Hal"" theres no message of tolerance or acceptance here to slightly sweeten the crass crude humor. Its just the same one-two punch stretched out over two hours Wow look at those idiots. Arent they idiots? Nor is there anything truly transgressive. Monty Python John Waters -- even early Pedro Almodovar -- deliberately queasily broke taboos to make us see societys real ugliness; their bad taste came ironically from good taste. The Farrellys just comes from grossness. Both stars unhesitatingly commit themselves to the parts which they have to but the sight of Carrey smashing food into his face (or Daniels simple slackjawed stare) soon bores. At least as an old girlfriend Kathleen Turner gets a few laughs (even though most are cruelly at her expense); as a supposed master of camouflage Rob Riggle gets exactly two. But a lot of other jokes misfire -- including a now accidentally but colossally mistimed cameo by June Shannon from ""Here Comes Honey Boo Boo"" whom no ones in the mood to smile at anymore. Occasionally particularly when it sticks to simple slapstick the movie wins a laugh. But the majority of it isnt just dumb and dumber or even crude and cruder. At nearly two hours its just dull -- and duller. Ratings note The film contains strong language sexual situations and violence. Dumb and Dumber To (PG-13) Universal (110 min.) Directed by Bobby Farrelly Peter Farrelly. With Jim Carrey Jeff Daniels.

(Hopper Stone/Universal Pictures/ASSOCIATED PRESS) Harry and Lloyd are back in Dumb and Dumber To not as loveable losers but loudmouth louts.(Hopper Stone/Universal Pictures/ASSOCIATED PRESS) Dumb and Dumber To Funny enough to make you wish it were better Add to ... Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Nov. 14 2014 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Nov. 14 2014 1245PM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Bobby Farrelly and Peter Farrelly Written by Peter Farrelly Mike Cerrone John Morris Bennett Yellin Bobby Farrelly and Sean Anders Starring Jim Carrey Jeff Daniels and Kathleen Turner Classification PG Genre comedy Year 2014 Country USA Language English The movie Dumb and Dumber To is as much a tribute as a sequel to 1994s Dumb and Dumber the first movie from Peter and Bobby Farrelly and a whole endearingly stupid comedy genre. True to the original the plot (credited to six writers) is sketch-on-a-napkin thin the physical comedy is much better than the malaprop-stuffed dialogue. And over all the movie is just funny enough to make you wish it were much better than it is. Video Video Why Matthew McConaughey went sci-fi with Interstellar The differences are that the stars are older - Jim Carreys 52 and Jeff Daniels is 59 - and seem less youthfully irrepressible than middle-aged persistent and the supporting performances are more cartoonish than in the earlier comedy.The movies dare-you-to-laugh tone is set before the opening credits when a disheveled Harry (Daniels) visits his old buddy Lloyd (Carrey) in a nursing home where he has been for 20 years in a catatonic state and now resembles late-stage Howard Hughes. It turns out  Lloyds just been playing a really extended prank and after they have a good laugh Harry enlists a couple of gardeners to help yank and yank and yank out Lloyds catheter.Back in the crappy Provincetown apartment (from the first movie) with the Bo Derek poster on the wall Harry now lives with a meth cooker and a cat named Butthole but life isnt perfect. He needs a new kidney and an old girlfriend has informed him shes pregnant - though the postmark on the letter is more than 20 years old. Lloyds old girlfriend funeral home director Fraida (Kathleen Turner) tells them that years ago she had a daughter Penny that she gave up for adoption. Fraida shows them a picture of the adult Penny (Rachel Melvin) and Lloyd promptly falls in lust with her. For Harry she represents a chance at a ""genital donor match"" for a new kidney. They head off on their quest in a borrowed hearse.You might recall how Lloyd and Harry got entangled in a criminal plot in the first movie. Theres another one here. Pennys adoptive parents are a wealthy but ailing scientist (Steve Tom) and his wife (Laurie Holden) who schemes with her gardener boyfriend Travis (Rob Riggle who does double duty as Traviss twin brother). Penny who is dumb on a Lloyd/Harry level but cuter has gone to El Paso to accept an award on her fathers behalf but has left an important parcel behind.Soon Lloyd Harry and Travis head to El Paso to deliver the mysterious package to the conference and catch up with Penny. Much flatulence and some violence ensues and the movies final third is spent at a brainiac convention clearly modelled on the TED talks where Harry and Lloyd do crude things around refined people to diminishing laugh returns though the multicultural trio of Canadian hoser geniuses in Maple Leaf regalia is a pleasant sop to Carreys home-country fans.Dumb and Dumber To is an infectious movie in that you feel stupider just by watching it. Confusions arise Which character for example is Dumb and which is Dumber? Harry is clumsy and loud but less of a risk-taker and thus less of a failure. Lloyd is manic and romantic and has ideas that are usually terrible. So hes dumber but in a way we all want to be.Somewhat more troubling is the question posed by a confused homonym in the title that ends up as a dangling preposition Dumb and Dumber To where? Theres a new meanness in Dumb and Dumber To - nasty jokes about elderly Asians accents insults about Kathleen Turners weight and a scene where Lloyd and Harry yell sexist taunts at a female lecturer - which is unpleasant a kind of postmillennial snark thats a bad fit. With six writers churning out the jokes perhaps someone forgot this is supposed to be a movie about loveable losers not loudmouth louts.Editors note The original version of this story did not correctly refer to characters Harry and Lloyd. This version has been corrected.

(Photo Universal Pictures )Stupidity it seems stands the test of time.""Dumb and Dumber To"" a sequel 20 years in the making turns out to be just as idiotic as its forebear a nonstop parade of misused words fractured logic infantile choices and deluded perseverance. It goes for laughs -- no matter how cheap or telescoped -- with gleeful impunity caring not a whit for sincerity or subtlety.Its really funny.This despite the fact that lead dodos Lloyd Christmas (Jim Carrey) and Harry Dunne (Jeff Daniels) are played by actors now aged 52 and 59. Dumbness apparently transcends age and both actors throw themselves into the goofiness with total abandon.True the emphasis this time around seems a bit more verbal than physical. But Carrey still brings his clownish agility to the party and Daniels as smart an actor as there is is fearlessly oblivious at all times.The story begins with Harry visiting Lloyd at the insane asylum where hes spent the past two decades in an apparent catatonic state. Except -- surprise -- Lloyd suddenly lets Harry in on the fact hes been faking all along. Ha Gotcha Good one an impressed Harry has to admit.When they get back to their apartment complex -- yes the blind kid with birds still lives there -- Harry tells Lloyd he is in desperate need of a kidney. They go to Harrys folks house but since they turn out to be Japanese a genetic match-up seems unlikely.But then Harry gets news that he may have fathered a child -- theres a kidney So they search out the birth mother (a wonderfully rough Kathleen Turner) but it turns out she gave the girl up for adoption. By now Penny (Rachel Melvin splendidly vacuous) has turned into full-blown empty-headed hogtie and shes now on her way to an egghead convention to give a speech for her genius scientist adoptive father.So of course Harry and Lloyd have to go to the egghead convention where theyll fit right in. Complicating matters even further are the scientists evil second wife (Laurie Holden) and her twin henchmen (Rob Riggle). So everything should go smooth right?Directors and co-writers Bobby and Peter Farrelly were pretty much the funniest men behind a camera in Hollywood from 1994 to 2003 (the original ""Dumb"" ""Theres Something About Mary"" ""Me Myself amp; Irene"" ""Stuck on You""). Then suddenly the funny dust seemed to disappear.Apparently all it took to fix things was to bring back these two idiots. The approach is familiar -- joke after joke after joke relentlessly -- while both Carrey and Daniels are so freaking on that theres no stopping the momentum. And thank heavens. In a world of ISIS Ebola dwindling retirement funds and severe drought somehow this film seems needed.""Dumb and Dumber To"" may not help anyone who needs a kidney -- but then again it might. Laughter is after all the best medicine.TLongdetroitnews.comtwitter.com/toomuchTomLongDumb and Dumber ToGRADE B+Rated PG-13 for crude and sexual humor partial nudity language and some drug referencesRunning time 110 minutes 97 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 15 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1urZStj MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2014/11/13/carrey-daniels-bring-yuks-dumber/18992855/,200,dumbanddumberto8,dumbanddumberto,detroitnews

Those people hadnt of course actually bothered to see the movie and thus had no sense of its peculiar sweet-spirited un-toilet-trained brilliance. Times have changed thank God and today Dumb and Dumber is rightly considered a classic a number one deserving of a proper number two In Dumb and Dumber To Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels return as Lloyd Christmas and Harry Dunne best friends who share a few thousand brain cells give or take between them. Theyre 20 years older if not 20 years wiser and though their faces have aged appropriately both look more or less the same as they used to Lloyd with his chipped tooth and cereal-bowl bangs Harry with his birds-nest mop of hair and half-perplexed half-disgusted scowl. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - But somethings not right. Theres a vague sourness to Dumb and Dumber To uncharacteristic of the Farrellys -- even their Three Stooges movie for all its eye-poking and nose-doinking was filled with bratty affection. In Dumb and Dumber To the moments that underscore Lloyd and Harrys devotion to each other feel overwritten and forced (even if they do include a few instances of wholly selfless diaper changing). The two spend more time dishing out sharp jabs to the nuts and semi-advertently killing off tropical birds than doing sweet stuff like smelling each others farts -- although theres a little of that too. The plot -- in which Harry and Lloyd leave their beloved Rhode Island and set off in search of the daughter Harry never knew he had a ditzy dish with an overachieving grin (Rachel Melvin) -- moves efficiently enough; its the movies lackluster spirit that lags behind.Thats a shame because there are more than a few inspired gags here exuberant in their go-for-broke idiocy Lloyd refers to Harrys long-lost daughter as ""the fruit of your loom."" The two phone each other accidentally from opposite ends of a couch. And in a superb reprise of the genius ""soup du jour"" joke from Dumb and Dumber Lloyd hears that a bar is serving drinks ""gratis"" and responds thoughtfully ""That sounds expensive."" But the misfires including a strange menstruation gag far outnumber the hits. Dumb and Dumber To is mostly just a kick in the nuts and not the good kind -- provided there is a good kind.Film Details Dumb and Dumber To RatingPG-13 GenreComedy Running Time110 More Info Trailer Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Stephanie Zacharek Follow szacharek Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

Photo Hopper Stone More On dumb and dumber to 6 of Bill Murrays greatest onscreen cameos 5 dumb questions with Dumb and Dumber To star Jeff Daniels 7 painful upcoming sequel titles 10 laugh out loud moments from the original Dumb and Dumber MOVIE REVIEW Dumb and Dumber To Running time 110 minutes. Rated PG-13 (rude language and jokes bare butts). At the E-Walk 34th St. others. Given the title you cant claim you didnt know what you were in for. Jim Carrey Jeff Daniels and the Farrelly brothers have reunited after 20 years to recapture a bit of moronic magic. And from time to time it works. Along the way though theyre pretty awful to women gays Asians the elderly animals scientists and -- most unforgivably -- Kathleen Turner. But there are moments in between in which Carrey and Daniels once again catch a spark of gleeful infectious lunacy. Carrey more than Daniels really; this is not an equal partnership. Carrey was born to do this stuff whether hes eating a mustard-slicked hot dog hands-free joyfully shoving a stranger into shrubbery or making ""the second most annoying noise in the world."" Hes older now -- theyre both showing it -- but the rubber-faced comic is as firmly tapped into his inner ""5-year-old on too much sugar"" as a pal of mine once aptly put it as ever. Daniels tends to look like hes trying. Trying perhaps to remember the paycheck. Or the way his hair looked so much nicer on ""The Newsroom."" Jim Carrey (left) and Jeff Daniels have reunited after 20 years for the sequel to ""Dumb and Dumber.""Photo Hopper Stone Lloyd (Carrey) and Harry (Daniels) are lifelong best friends forever linked in paucity of IQ. Theyre reunited in an extended bit about why its been 20 years since weve seen them and it creates a reason for Daniels to be holding a bag of pee in his teeth two minutes into the film. Just in case you were wondering how low a bar we were starting off with. Once theyve caught up Harry reveals he needs a kidney transplant and conveniently finds out hes got a child he never knew about. This news is delivered courtesy of Turner as the mother who gave her up for adoption. The veteran actress presence is rewarded with a crack about ""blowfish jowls"" (the likes of which are also found on both of our leading men). The duo sets out to track down Harrys daughter (Rachel Melvin) and find out if she is as Lloyd puts it ""a genital organ match."" They end up en route to a science convention shes attending accompanied by an evil henchman (Rob Riggle) of the daughters bad-news stepmom (Laurie Holden). Riggle gets a couple of the films funniest sight gags; I wont spoil it but his military-trained character can blend in just about anywhere. Jim Carrey as Lloyd Christmas.Photo Hopper Stone The travelogue is a thin structure on which to hang bit after bit about how impossibly stupid if well-intentioned these two are. The films best moments are its least mean and most absurdist. ""He said it was something that would help everyone in the world right?"" Lloyd says of a scientists mysterious box. ""I think its a baked potato."" Also sometimes the most infantile -- as when Harry and Lloyd find out how women get pregnant. ""But thats where she PEES"" Carrey howls flailing around in disgust. I laughed out loud but not enough. Youd think for a movie two decades in the making the Farrellys might have had time to cook up better material. Im not among those who think the original is a comic masterpiece but their bowling movie ""Kingpin"" might be. They may favor the gross-out but they can do and have done better than a too-long sequence about a game of ""Who Smelt It"" in the car. You know the way some mawkish dramas make you tear up unwittingly? This movie is the opposite of that Its a laugh-jerker.

"Dumb and Dumber To is still dumb (and funny) after all these years review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesDumb and Dumber To is still dumb (and funny) after all these years review Dumb and Dumber To is that rare long-delayed sequel that hasnt suffered from a weight of unrealized expectations probably because the bar is always low on comedies like this.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Nov. 13 2014Dumb and Dumber ToStarring Jim Carrey Jeff Daniels Kathleen Turner Rob Riggle Laurie Holden Rachel Melvin and Steve Tom. Directed by Bobby and Peter Farrelly. At GTA theatres. 109 minutes. PGFor lo these 20 years fans of Dumb and Dumber have pondered the fate of Lloyd Christmas and Harry Dunne the two lovable lunkheads played by Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels.Did they ever open their worm shop Ive Got Worms?Article Continued BelowDid another busload of bikini babes invite them to frolic?Did they ever grow another brain cell?The long-awaited sequel Dumb and Dumber To indirectly answers the first two questions but it resoundingly belches out the third response. Not only did these two maroons not get any smarter its entirely possible that their room-temperature IQs dropped a few digits in the past two decades.Stooge-browed Lloyd and wild-haired Harry are still making colossally dumb moves such as confusing embalming fluid for Kool-Aid assuming that a blind bird fancier would make a great cat-sitter and playing a car game called ""He Who Smelt It"" (three guesses what that is the first two dont count).There are new locales and characters including a not-so-swift gal played by Rachel Melvin who amusingly makes the case for idiocy running in the family.But theres still a riotous road trip in the Mutt Cutts van involving the pursuit of a woman who doesnt want to be pursued and still a pile of money at stake that bad people want to get their hands on.Jim Carrey left and Jeff Daniels reprise their roles as Lloyd and Harry in Dumb and Dumber To.  (Universal Studios)  Rehashing plot points of the original is perfectly OK as it turns out. I laughed a lot at this movie possibly even more than I did at the original film which I enjoyed quite a bit. Dumb and Dumber To is that rare long-delayed sequel that hasnt suffered from a weight of unrealized expectations probably because the bar is always low on comedies like this. Torontonians might be momentarily confused by the ""To"" in the title which is a deliberate misspelling of ""2"" and not a shout-out to Hogtown. But the Farrellys and their co-writers do enjoying messing with us because one of the nerds at the brainiacs convention in Texas where Lloyd and Harry end up sports a Toronto Maple Leafs jersey. There are a couple of other nyuks at the expense of Canucks.That convention in El Paso by the way is where the humour starts to get a little thin as the plot gets more serious yet even more stupid. Overall its just a pleasure to see Carrey and Daniels being dumb together again both looking a little older but none the worse for wear.Especially Carrey who really seems to enjoy playing the kind of insane role that made him famous. Just watching him eat a hotdog made me laugh.Daniels makes a most excellent comic foil even if he never gets a moment to rival the infamous toilet scene from the first movie.Dumb and Dumber To also doesnt have Lauren Holly from the original hit but it does have a very game Kathleen Turner who sets in motion a quest for Lloyd and Harry to find the child whom Harry sired but never knew.The film is directed as was the original by Bobby and Peter Farrelly who have made the humour even grosser than the first time which marked their debut as feature directors. Theyre keeping up with more explicit times and also their own can-you-top-this sibling sensibilities.Which just goes to show you Even if you cant teach old dogs new tricks you can certainly teach them ruder ones.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Dumb and Dumber To | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; dumb-and-dumber-to ) Dumb and Dumber To (United States 2014) November 13 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli What propels filmmakers to make a sequel to a 20-year old film? Is it nostalgia for the brand of comedy that characterized the original? Is it desperation on everyones part to revive flagging careers? Or is it Hollywoods acceptance that recognizable brands should be given preferential treatment over anything untried? Whatever the reason the waning months of 2014 have brought us the follow-up to 1994s Dumb and Dumber but the lengthy gestation period hasnt resulted in an appreciably upgraded experience. Dumb and Dumber represented the directorial debut of the Farrelly Brothers (Peter and Bobby) who would achieve notoriety four years later with Theres Something about Mary. 1994 was Jim Carreys breakout year - he was able to command a 7 million salary for Dumb and Dumber (nearly half the budget). The film was a huge success making north of 100 million at the box office (when 100 million meant something) but it was nine years before a prequel was commissioned. 2003s Dumb and Dumberer When Harry Met Lloyd featured the participation of neither the Farrellys nor stars Carrey and Jeff Daniels and was greeted at American multiplexes with deserved indifference. Fast-forward to 2014. With Carrey no longer a major draw (translation cheaper) and the Farrellys more than a decade past their last hit the return of Lloyd and Harry became a reality. But does anyone care? Its likely that those with an abiding love of Dumb and Dumber will be pleased by the tone and approach of Dumb and Dumber To which carefully replicates the few strengths and many weaknesses of its predecessor. Carrey in particular shows an uncanny knack for turning back the clock he hasnt been this annoying since his second turn as Ace Ventura. Jeff Daniels looks considerably older but duplicates the boyish charm he showed two decades ago when his features were less craggy and wrinkled. Truth be told Dumb and Dumber To is a better made film than Dumb and Dumber. The jokes are more consistently funny and the production values are stronger. That doesnt make it a good movie but at least its not unbearable. Dumb and Dumber To opens with a Rip Van Winkle premise (the comedic potential of which is woefully underused) - Lloyd (Carrey) awakens after being in a coma for 20 years. Then comes the bombshell Harry (Daniels) reveals that without a kidney transplant hes not long for this life. Soon after the duo learns that a fling Harry had with Fraida Felcher (Kathleen Turner) 22 years ago resulted in a pregnancy. The baby girl was given up for adoption and now bears the name of Penny Pinchelow (Rachel Melvin). Considering her genetic makeup she has whats necessary to provide Harry with his new kidney so the two most clueless men in America go on a trip (in a hearse) to track down Penny who is their Mensa match. Dumb and Dumber To is constructed like most road movies with an episodic structure. A few of these segments are amusing; most do little more than pad out the running time. There are some big laughs but many of the jokes try too hard or simply arent funny. The returning actors deliver as expected. Newcomers like Laurie Holden who plays Adele Pennys devious step-mother and Rob Riggle as Travis Adeles lover and henchman dont add much. Rachel Melvin however is delightful channeling the ""dumb and dumber"" approach to a female personality. The big question facing everyone involved in Dumb and Dumber To is whether theres an audience out there. Although the movie does its best to push the PG-13 envelope when it comes to sexual and scatological references theres nothing groundbreaking here and members of the core demographic for films of this nature werent born when Dumb and Dumber was released. Will those in their mid-30s show up? Despite being sporadically entertaining Dumb and Dumber To has all the hallmarks of a nostalgia-fueled cash-grab. Its neither good nor terrible and even those who remember its predecessor with affection would be advised to wait for the DVD. This doesnt need to be seen in theaters or for that matter at all.

"Review Dumb and Dumber To a chip off the older blockheads - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Dumb and Dumber To just a chip off the older blockheads Dumb and Dumber To Movie review by Betsy Sharkey Betsy Sharkey reviews Dumb and Dumber To Starring Jim Carrey Jeff Daniels and Kathleen Turner. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Betsy Sharkey reviews Dumb and Dumber To Starring Jim Carrey Jeff Daniels and Kathleen Turner. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Betsy Sharkey Review Dumb and Dumber To teams Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels for more of the same stupid human tricks Two hours is a whole lot of dumb. So in that respect ""Dumb and Dumber To"" starring the off-the-chain goofballing Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels delivers on its promise.The sequels definitely been dumbed down which is not really an issue. If you buy a ticket to a movie called ""Dumb and Dumber To"" dumb is precisely what you expect want and possibly need. But what felt fresh in Peter and Bobby Farrellys original ""Dumb and Dumber"" with the Carrey-Daniels dense duo channeling the Stooges and Jerry Lewis and something else entirely feels strangely old-fashioned two decades later. Hollywood wasnt specializing in stupidity so much in 1994.Now we live in a time when dumb buddy comedy has become an entire strain of filmmaking and a hugely profitable one. It includes three ""Hangovers"" and nearly everything Will Ferrell does with anchorman Ron Burgundy the highest form of his lowbrow. Theres an entire subset of Owen Wilson-Vince Vaughn-Ben Stiller antics mixed and matched across countless films including ""The Wedding Crashers"" ""Dodgeball"" ""Starsky amp; Hutch"" and ""The Internship."" There is even an entrenched ""Superbad"" next generation of Seth Rogens and Jonah Hills. Carreys Lloyd Christmas and Daniels Harry Dunne bring us back to a simpler dumb-buddy time in ""Dumb and Dumber To"" again directed by the Farrelly brothers.If youve seen the trailers -- can anyone escape them? -- you know that Lloyds finally come out of his fake coma a 20-year gag that Harry deems ""awesome."" The two guys pick up where they left off older but no wiser. Video Trailer Dumb and Dumber To Watch the trailer for ""Dumb and Dumber To."" Watch the trailer for ""Dumb and Dumber To."" See more videos Harrys living in the same dumpy apartment with two significant changes -- his new roommate makes meth and the blind boy who bought the guys headless dead parakeet in the first film has grown up and is now surrounded by a flock of exotic birds.But with the sheer number of cooks in the ""Dumber To"" kitchen -- its written by Sean Anders John Morris both Farrelly brothers Bennett Yellin and Mike Cerrone -- the sequel sometimes feels like a series of gags ginned up by a gaggle of writers who are not always on the same page. Dumb and Dumber To Universal Studios A scene from ""Dumb and Dumber To."" A scene from ""Dumb and Dumber To."" (Universal Studios) There are all the expected blind jokes fart jokes pee jokes and poop jokes. Flashbacks to Harry changing Lloyds adult diapers during the coma phase become a running gag.The occasional shot of the top of Harrys derriere such a hoot in the first feels impossibly tame in a time when showing your Calvins is passe and Kim Kardashians naked backside on a magazine cover is trending. In an effort to remain relevant some of the punchlines also target race Asperger syndrome and AIDS to name a few. Im sure if the film had landed next year Ebola would make the mix.The reason for the road trip this time other than to provide different locales for all the slapstick silliness and the return of the mutt-mobile is Harrys medical condition. Hes in need of a kidney transplant and an old postcard from ex-girlfriend Fraida (Kathleen Turner) informs him that he fathered a daughter years ago. Penny (Rachel Melvin) who was put up for adoption would be a perfect donor match for Harry. If only they could find her.Enter the villains and the reasons the guys are once again at risk of being killed. Suffice it to say that instead of a briefcase filled with cash this time theyre transporting a box filled with a billion-dollar scientific breakthrough.Lloyd and Harry are soon racing against time headed to a scientific convention in El Paso where Pennys picking up an award for her Nobel-winning adopted dad (Steve Tom). Rob Riggle playing twins -- a back-stabbing gardener named Travis and a black-ops specialist named Capt. Lippincott -- is the best of the bad guys. Of all the secondary players Melvin who spent years in the ""Days of Our Lives"" daytime trenches is the best. The actress does a pretty decent dumb that echoes both Harry and Lloyd which is no easy task.The production value of ""To"" reflects the bigger budget that the follow-up to a surprise hit often brings. As it happens though more money doesnt make all that much difference in executing a fart joke.One of the charms of the ""Dumb"" routine is the way it lets Carrey go wild. His comic streak is a mile wide and the Farrellys use every inch of it. Whether hes dousing a chili pepper burn with huge squirts of ketchup and mustard or honestly just standing smiling or talking Carrey is mind-blowing to watch.After a recent string of films characterized by more misses than hits its good to see the actor back at the top of his game contorting that rubber mouth into impossible grins and grimaces before breaking into some manic yuck-yuck-yucking or using those rubber legs to make one unforgettable entrance after another.Daniels destined to play second fiddle in the first feels like hes moved to third in ""To."" In part its a function of a super amped-up Carrey. But some of the blame rests with Aaron Sorkins intelligent HBO drama ""The Newsroom"" which has turned Daniels anchorman into a Walter Cronkite-level brand of flawed headline-disseminating integrity.Before ""Dumb and Dumber"" Daniels was known for the subtler brand of comedy we saw in Woody Allens ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"" (1985) and ""Radio Days"" (1987) or for being frequently confused with acting peer Bill Pullman. ""Dumb"" Harry hit defining him for a bit. Then the actor began opting for smarter and serious working his way toward the classy newscaster. Its hard to go back from such intellectual heights to the dumb milieu especially given Carreys very long shadow. To his credit Daniels tries his best but when it comes to dumb and dumber Carrey is better.Twitter BetseySharkey Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Reviews Entertainment Jim Carrey The Newsroom (tv program) Woody Allen Will Ferrell Read more movie reviews gt;gt; Rosewater Jon Stewart scores solid reviews in directing debut Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad76deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-dumb-dumber-to-review-20141114-column.html,200,dumbanddumberto13,dumbanddumberto,latimes

(AP Photo/Universal Pictures) Photo Associated Press Image 12 of 12 Dumb and Dumber To review What were they thinking? 1 / 12 Back to Gallery Is this worse for Jim Carrey or Jeff Daniels? Thats the sort of question that comes to mind while not laughing at ""Dumb and Dumber To."" Either out of nostalgia or a sense of loyalty or some epic misreading of the script or a payday beyond the dreams of most mere mortals Carrey and Daniels agreed to appear in this ghastly sequel which is more than just not funny. ""King Lear"" isnt funny. This is anti-funny where every attempt at a joke is like a little rock thrown at your face. Directed by Bobby Farrelly and Peter Farrelly who collaborated on the screenplay with four other people ""Dumb and Dumber To"" gets off to an awful start that sets the tone for all that follows. Twenty years after their ""Dumb and Dumber"" adventures Lloyd (Carrey) is catatonic and institutionalized and Harry has been visiting him once a week for 20 years. Then one afternoon Lloyd starts laughing and says ""Gotcha"" Its a hoax. Lloyd has been pretending to be mentally ill -- for 20 years -- to set up Harry for the big punch line. For some reason that just isnt a funny opening. I dont know if its because the thought of someone doing that for 20 years is too much to believe or because Lloyds prank is in itself not funny. Maybe the problem is that Lloyds stunt doesnt quite seem dumb -- sort of a requirement of the movie and the character -- but just weird. In any case the bit falls flat and oddly enough you can almost sense Carrey and Daniels knowing it. They push the material they flog it and its almost as embarrassing to watch as if they were live onstage reacting to a dead-silent audience. Then comes the physical gag Harry yanks Lloyd out of his wheelchair by pulling on his catheter What is it about the alchemy of comedy? Yanking on a catheter -- funny in theory maybe. But in practice? Its about as funny as well needing a kidney. Oh yes the plot kicks in Harry needs a kidney transplant so they go in search of the daughter he fathered and never met hoping that shell give him one. Thats the story engine of ""Dumb and Dumber To"" The boys go in search of a daughter and a kidney. High jinks ensue except they dont. The script is weak leaving Carrey with lots of time to fill by mugging. Watching him and Daniels here you realize how much maturity is the enemy of this kind of comedy. Past a certain age -- its probably between 45 and 50 -- the spectacle of someone being really really dumb stops evoking an uncomplicated laugh. Theres the sense that they should know better or that they do know better so why are they acting this way? Daniels practically talks baby talk as Harry and its ever-so-faintly grotesque. Kathleen Turner plays the biological mother of Harrys child and she gets into the spirit and is a good sport. And the movie has one genuinely funny bit. Harry mistaken for a scientific genius at a tech conference becomes an onstage judge of new products. The audience reacts to his idiotic comments as though he were just a playful eccentric. Daniels given something to work with finds the laughs. It might only be a three-minute oasis in a sleep-inducing desert but its the difference between a garden-variety disaster and an annihilating debacle. Oh yes and the answer to the question ""Dumb and Dumber To"" is worse for Carrey. Daniels arguably could be slumming but Carrey has a reputation as a comedian to uphold. Sure his reputation can recover just as one might recover from hitting oneself in the head with a hammer. But the point is you should never do that to yourself in the first place.

(AP Photo/Universal Pictures Hopper Stone)LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Comedy is all about timing. The dimwitted Lloyd (Jim Carrey) reminds the audience of that simple fact minutes into ""Dumb and Dumber To"" and the sentiment echoes throughout the disappointing return. Twenty years have passed since audiences first met and improbably fell for Lloyd and Harry (Jeff Daniels) and the boys are up to their same old stunts which is the fundamental problem Theyve stayed the same. Weve changed.""Dumb and Dumber"" was received favorably enough by critics when it was released in late 1994 -- back when Jim Carrey seemed like he had the potential to be the next Jerry Lewis. But no one could have foreseen the effect this ridiculous tale of a couple of idiots traveling cross country to return a briefcase would have on the culture in the coming decades.Lloyd and Harrys antics and one-off lines penetrated our collective imaginations and managed to do that thing that all comedies dream of -- get better or at least more beloved with time. The ill-conceived sequel however is so uninspired that it could retroactively tarnish our affection for the original.This next chapter technically picks up where we left off at least in terms of Lloyd and Harrys relationship. Lloyd has been pretending to be comatose for 20 years all for the sake of a gotcha moment which Harry fully enjoys.Anyway Harry soon reveals that hes in dire need of a new kidney. The story is set in motion when he discovers he might be the father of a daughter Penny (Rachel Melvin) and they head off to find her. Plot is almost beside the point but it does follow the beats of the first to a tee. There are road trips set to jaunty songs straight men to annoy and a rich woman with nefarious plans that theyll inevitably screw up. Lloyd even has a new pretty young thing to dream about in Penny.But what may have been subversive and irreverent in 1994 now just seems vulgar hateful and tone-deaf -- from their unabashedly misogynistic treatment of women (including Kathleen Turner as Pennys mom) to their insidious racism. In the harsh light of 2014 their juvenile buffoonery looks embarrassing and lazy. Its hard to imagine a new generation latching on to this brand of humor.Thats not to say that the movie is entirely without merit or laughs. Co-directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly adore their characters and are trying to give fans what they want the nostalgic joy of an unfussy reunion devoid of modern snark or meta commentary. Stars Carrey and Daniels are clearly giving it their all too as energetic and vital as ever with their strikingly aged visages. Carreys in particular has reached a peak of elastic malleability giving him a grotesquely broad palette to play with.Also Rob Riggles entry mid-movie adds a much-needed dynamism to the film by finally giving the guys a suitable comedian to play against. Hes responsible for most of the very few laughs and a visual gag so brilliant that some might even be compelled to see it again. But ultimately its too little too late.Some things are just better left in the past. Its a shame ""Dumb and Dumber"" wasnt one of them.""Dumb and Dumber To"" a Universal Pictures release is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for ""crude and sexual humor partial nudity language and some drug references.""

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The best gag in Dumb And Dumber To arrives around the midway mark when aging idiots Lloyd Christmas (Jim Carrey) and Harry Dunne (Jeff Daniels) have an unexpected blast from the past. There in front of them in all its ragged canine glory is the 84 sheepdog they traded straight up on their 1994 odyssey to Aspen. Twenty years have elapsed on-screen and off since these brain-dead besties last saw their beloved shaggin wagon and theres something undeniably rousing about the sight of the two men careening down the open road again in the custom-designed vehicle hair (and fur) to the wind. And then they go over a steep hill the van lands with a spectacular thud and the engine shorts. No more shaggin wagon. Nostalgia trip over.The joke is on Lloyd and Harry two classic imbeciles who manage to ruin everything good that comes their way. But its also on the audience for clinging to its affection for a two-decade-old buddy comedy. In a way just about every joke in this belated inferior follow-up is on the audience--at least those of us who were remotely excited about the prospect of seeing these characters again. Reuniting the stars of their first and still best movie gross-out maestros the Farrelly brothers have made what may well be their worst movie--a sequel as desperate in its own ""official"" way as the knockoff-brand origin story that previously besmirched the franchise name. Dumb And Dumber To is crueler crasser grosser lazier creepier and yes dumber than the first film. It somehow manages paradoxically to both misplace the originals sublime screwball charm and to recycle pages upon pages of material from that earlier movie. How many morons does it take to write a Dumb And Dumber sequel? Six adult men the Farrellys among them toiled away on the script which sends the intellectually deprived heroes on another road trip this one to find the daughter (Rachel Melvin) who might be able to supply shaggy-haired doofus Harry with a spare kidney. The boys travels put them in contact with the girls mother the fabled Fraida Felcher (best of sports Kathleen Turner hired to endure countless cracks about her appearance) as well as a pair of murderous schemers (Laurie Holden and Rob Riggle) who underestimate the destructive power of pure stupidity.If that last part sounds familiar its because its one of several plot elements Dumb And Dumber To lifts almost wholesale from its predecessor. As if going down a checklist the writers supply another MacGuffin another impossible dream girl and another put-upon travel-mate with malicious intentions. (Riggle in the Mike Starr role is himself too outrageous to properly play straight man.) More dispiriting than the narrative plagiarism are the endless callbacks the fan-service repetition of old gags; rather than pen new material the writers simply rely on the presumed vicarious humor of seeing Carrey blow mouth spray in the wrong direction again. Heres Petey the blind man. Theres the second most annoying sound in the world. And if one elaborate fantasy sequence is funny two will really kill right?Sweetness has always been the secret weapon of the Farrellys lowbrow comedy auteurs whose warm humanism has steadily eclipsed their taste for dick and fart jokes. As if making up for lost time--or perhaps testing the limits of the PG-13 rating which are apparently quite elastic--Dumb And Dumber To proudly dramatically tips the scale back in favor of showboating grotesquerie. Testicles are torn off. Bodily fluids are consumed. The literally dusty nether-regions of elderly women are probed. Theres something admirable now and perhaps forever about the Farrellys tireless swipes for the gag reflex. But the filmmakers usually invest their bad taste with a good nature; Dumb And Dumber To is weirdly mean-spirited trotting out gay-panic jokes and AIDS zingers while severely overdoing Lloyds cradle-robbing intentions toward his buddys dimwitted daughter.For fans of the original which was a true high-water mark in Hollywood buffoonery it may be tough to resist the charm of seeing these two actors play stupid again--and both Carrey and Daniels slip into their old chemistry with uncanny ease. But the buzz wears off quickly harshed as it is by the increasingly sad spectacle of two fiftysomething movie stars acting like horny leering teenagers. When during a science conference Harry and Lloyd shout ""show us your tits"" in unison at a young woman onstage it becomes clear that the characters are now less guileless nincompoops than dirty old men. This time around theyre gross (and dumb) in all the wrong ways.

The Farrelly brothers latest is an earnest throwback that plays to the strengths of a filmmaking duo whose sense of humor has always been pitched between classical and outdated. Dumb and Dumber To may not be quite as funny as the first one but its the funniest thing the Farrellys have made since. The kind of movie that features 50-year-old men hot-boxing the back of a hearse with their own farts Dumb and Dumber To is a refreshingly straightforward rejoinder to a time when the average studio comedy was more self-reflexive than a Kiarostami film. The plot might knowingly mimic the original but it does so more out of fidelity than laziness Harry in dire need of a new kidney learns that he fathered a daughter in 1991. The mother (Kathleen Turner whose impressively thick skin is as much a magnet for jokes as it is a shield against them) reveals that the baby was adopted by one of the countrys most brilliant men. Faster than you can make the most annoying sound in the world Harry and Lloyd are road-tripping to meet the girl at a science conference in El Paso leaving all sorts of carnage in their wake. Between Harry forcibly removing Lloyds colostomy bag (its a long story) a bizarre string of Barbara Hershey references and the years best death scene its clear that the Farrelly brothers have a unique genius for engineering gags that are either a little dumber than you expect or a lot dumber than you can believe. Crucially their two leading stooges are just as committed to delivering them as they were in 1994. Any movie could feature a cat named ""Butthole"" (so named because as Harry illustrates the cat has a butthole) but the matter-of-fact sincerity with which Daniels sells the joke is a lost art. In fact Dumb and Dumber To is such a blast from the past that its digital varnish and CG flourishes feel like the only real affront to good taste in a film where every giggle is accompanied by a deep sense of head-shaking shame--you wont want to laugh when the cat tries meth but you will.

The Farrelly brothers movie is funny in places but inconsistent throughout.Jim Carrey (left) and Jeff Daniels in a scene from ""Dumb and Dumber To.""(Photo Universal Pictures)Story HighlightsCritics review 2 starsJim Carrey and Jeff Daniels reprise the characters from one of their biggest hits.The Farrelly brothers also return as ""Dumb and Dumber To"" directors.Lloyd and Harry again make a road trip with decidedly spottier results in the laugh department.Its misleading to call ""Dumb and Dumber To"" a disappointment because that description implies that the original movie was good.Eh. Better than this one but good? Granted the movie that made the Farrelly brothers rich Jim Carrey huge and Jeff Daniels ... um funny had some good laughs succeeding to the extent that it did by the complete commitment by the actors to behaving as idiotic as is humanly possible.And yes the scene in which they give a blind kid a dead bird as a pet is one of the funniest rude bits ever. But to put it charitably the first movie was mostly good dumb fun with such an emphasis on dumb they put it in the title.The movie has its fans however and theres a pretty good chance theyll be happy with the sequel because 20 years later Carreys Lloyd Christmas and Daniels Harry Dunne havent upped their IQs one iota. But whatever was fresh about Carrey and Daniels descent into stupidity the first time around just isnt the same in the sequel.That said the title is genius and I laughed out loud hard three or four times including at a pretty great Arizona State University joke. No MENSA card for me either then.More azcentral.coms newest movie reviewsThe film opens with Harry making his weekly visit to Lloyd who has lived for two decades in a nursing home in a catatonic state apparently set adrift by the loss of a woman. Turns out its a long setup for Lloyd to prank Harry who is so happy to have his friend back he yanks out his catheter (and enlists the help of two gardeners).Harry has problems of his own. He explains to Lloyd that he needs a kidney transplant and there are no suitable donors. (Harry never deduced that despite having Asian parents he was adopted.) But then he discovers thanks to a 20-year-old postcard from ""Titanic whore"" Fraida Felcher (Kathleen Turner either a remarkably good sport or a masochist for putting up with a degrading bit about her appearance) that he is evidently a father.Fraida gave the girl up for adoption; now Penny (Rachel Melvin) lives with a famous scientist though shes not exactly brilliant either.From left Jim Carrey Rob Riggle and Jeff Daniels in ""Dumb and Dumber To."" (Photo Universal Pictures)Thus this movie like the first turns into an extended road trip with Lloyd and Harry en route to find Penny and see if she will donate a kidney to Harry. Rob Riggle is along for part of the ride as an employee of Pennys father who has other plans for the trip.None of this matters all that much. For the Farrellys the story isnt crucial (though there are a couple of satisfying payoffs). The jokes are what they care about most. But if they were hit and miss in the first film here they are even more scatter-shot.Carrey and Daniels are good actors and its understandable when an artist wants to revisit a career-high point. How much you enjoy ""Dumb and Dumber To"" will depend greatly upon whether you think ""Dumb and Dumber"" was one.AZCENTRALDumb and Dumber To (2014) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsDumb and Dumber To2 starsDirectors Bobby and Peter Farrelly.Cast Jim Carrey Jeff Daniels Rob Riggle.Rating PG-13 for crude and sexual humor partial nudity language and some drug references.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 755 p.m. EST November 13 2014Harry (Jeff Daniels left) and Lloyd (Jim Carrey) reunite to find Harrys long-lost daughter in Dumb and Dumber To.(Photo Hopper Stone Universal Pictures)If there was any doubt that most things in society have been dumbed down in the last couple of decades Dumb and Dumber To could be exhibit A.We last saw the intelligence-challenged duo of Lloyd (Jim Carrey) and Harry (Jeff Daniels) 20 years ago and the intervening years have made them neither wiser nor funnier for this lame sequel ( out of four; rated R; opens Friday nationwide).In fact they seem meaner lewder and crasser. Whatever was lovable about them has dried up their brainless boyishess having given way to nasty nattering.USA TODAYYes the first Dumb and Dumber is still hilariousThe imbeciles are now in their 50s and stupidity is less appealing with age. They havent changed their dos or their style of clothes so its no surprise that their sense of humor hasnt matured either. Jokes about bathroom habits and flatulence abound.To update Lloyd has spent the last 20 years in a psychiatric hospital -- for a practical joke. Harry retaliates by yanking out his catheter. Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Jim Carey and Jeff Daniels are back at it again in Dumb and Dumber To. Twenty years since their first adventure Harry (Daniels) finds out he has a daughter who was adopted. The pair set out to track her down. VPCThe story loose as it is centers around Harry believing he has a daughter by Fraida Felcher (Kathleen Turner). He has just found out he needs a kidney transplant and hopes the 22- year-old daughter he never knew he had might want to donate one of hers.As in the original a big part of this brainless buddy movie features the guys on a road trip in vehicles from a hearse to a Zamboni to a van resembling a stuffed dog. Also like the original theres a criminal subplot that neither guy clues in to.The Farrelly brothers Peter and Bobby directed the original and return here. But theyve made much funnier and yes smarter comedies such as 1998s Theres Something About Mary. The key to their better movies is an underlying sweetness which is lacking here. The best Farrelly characters are ridiculously amusing but never intentionally cruel. Harry and Lloyd seemed to have missed that crucial lesson. One of the few funny lines comes courtesy of a doctor who endures the guys mindless prattling until hes forced to interrupt their ""Mensa summit."" Daniels and Carrey give it their all as does most of the aging cast. And theres something oddly brave about that. And pathetic. Apparently outrageously crassness knows no age limits.Sure this nearly two-hour bathroom joke is aimed at 11-year-old boys but thats no excuse for these sloppy seconds. 88 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 13 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1uqHH7l",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/11/13/dumb-and-dumber-to-review/18101807/,200,dumbanddumberto20,dumbanddumberto,usatoday

In 1994s smash hit Dumb and Dumber Jim Carreys Lloyd has such a moment when he tearfully expresses to Jeff Daniels Harry how he doesnt want to be a nobody anymore. Its an isolated bit of poignancy notable not just for the touch of depth it provides but also for how it foreshadowed the solid dramatic actor Carrey later became. You will find no such scene in the Farrellys slapdash 20-years-later sequel Dumb and Dumber To. There are maybe six hearty laughs in the picture which averages to about one per screenwriter (not a joke). This time around the goofballs attempt to seek out the adult daughter Harry never knew he had after he receives a decades-old postcard from her birth mother played by Kathleen Turner who looks deeply uncomfortable and is much ridiculed. (Seriously didnt riffing on Turners femasculinity seem old hat when the original Damp;D came out in 1994?) It turns out Harry needs a kidney which leads him to his daughters adoptive parents a scientist (Steve Tom) and his conniving wife (The Walking Deads Laurie Holden) whos already plotting with the household handyman (Rob Riggle) to take over the family fortune. Damp;D To visually checks off all of the first films hallmarks the dog-groomer van the upside-down breath spray moment Petey the parakeets blind owner the ""most annoying sound in the world."" The occasional clever sight gag proves the Farrellys are down but not quite out (a good one has Harry and Lloyd riding a bike together...thats already mounted on a bus bike rack). But the material feels more desperate than funny (""yankos los pee-pee"" for example is said to Mexican orderlies regarding a catheter mishap). Carrey and Daniels are forced to wring this middling material so hard they must have calluses. The ultimate sad realization is not that Dumb amp; Dumber To doesnt match the originals good-time quotient but that it might not even be as good as--yikes--Dumb and Dumberer When Harry Met Lloyd.

Photo Credit Universal Pictures advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Lloyd and Harry Americas favorite dimwits embark on another misadventure. Rated PG-13. BOTTOM LINE Stars and filmmakers alike are in their 50s but as infantile as ever. Die-hard fans may be pleased. CAST Jim Carrey Jeff Daniels Rob Riggle Rachel Melvin LENGTH 150 Jim Carrey Jeff Daniels and the Farrelly brothers have aged 20 years since ""Dumb and Dumber"" their 1994 comedy about two dimwits sailing through life on a sea of their own bodily fluids. The good and bad news about their long-awaited reunion ""Dumb and Dumber To"" is that maturity hasnt caught up with any of them. ""Dumb and Dumber"" was such a hit that a prequel and Hanna-Barbera cartoon series followed though the principals werent closely involved. Those projects tanked proving that there was some ineffable magic in the combination of Carrey as the bowl-cut chip-toothed Lloyd Christmas; Daniels as the frizzy-haired Harry Dunne; and writer-directors Peter and Bobby Farrelly (""Theres Something About Mary"") whose sense of humor is essentially The Three Stooges with flatulence. advertisement | advertise on newsday The original film was a series of set pieces hung on a flimsy caper-plot a formula as old as the Marx Brothers and Crosby-Hope. In the sequel Harry learns that he has a daughter Penny (Rachel Melvin) who has been adopted by the eminent Dr. Pinchelow (Steve Tom). Kathleen Turner plays Pennys aging tramp of a mother Fraida Felcher (a subplot from the first film) while the dependable Rob Riggle (""21 Jump Street"") does fine work as an exasperated villain. All you really need to know however is that this movie includes jokes about colostomy bags blind people and masturbation. Like it or not the Farrellys most famous creations tap into something eternal a vision of maleness so reductive that it goes beyond childish and into the infantile. (Career adolescents like Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill look like pipe-smoking professors by comparison.) Much of this films humor hinges on our heroes arrested sexual development Theyre fixated on breasts but ignorant about actual intercourse. ""Not my mom"" Lloyd hollers when its finally explained to him. Whether you find this hilarious or slightly disturbing is purely subjective. Carrey is as energetic and rubber-faced as ever while Daniels has improved vying for co-star status instead of playing the straight man. Still Harry and Lloyd remain less than endearing. Like very young children theyre slightly mercenary and malicious. Maybe thats the secret to their success. 240 MoviesDumb and Dumber To trailer Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

Jeff Daniels in Dumb and Dumber To (Hopper Stone SMPSP) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday November 13 2014 244 PM Title Dumb and Dumber To Film Info With Jim Carrey Jeff Daniels. Two dolts seek a kidney donor. Directors Peter and Bobby Farrelly. (150). PG-13; Language crudity. Area theaters. Some movie idiots are funnier than others. Yet Harry and Lloyd from ""Dumb and Dumber"" still hold a special spot for idiot aficionados because that 1994 Farrelly brothers comedy combined a classic rubes-on-the-loose structure with dementedly inspired turns from Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels. Now Carrey and Daniels are back but the laughs arent in the dull disappointing ""Dumb and Dumber To"" (yes...""to"" yuk yuk). For 20 years Lloyd (Carrey) has been catatonic in a Providence R.I. insane asylum visited by Harry (Daniels). But its just a joke between the gag-happy pals. Once Lloyds on his feet the duo have a new goal To find Harry (Daniels) a kidney donor. It turns out he may have a long-lost daughter Penny born to the town tramp (Kathleen Turner we hardly know ye). Turns out Penny (Rachel Melvin) has been adopted by a wealthy scientist. His wife and a handyman (Rob Riggle) are both trying to kill the old guy. So is the handymans assassin brother (also Riggle). At a science convention Harry is mistaken for a genius as Lloyd develops a crush on Penny. As the bloated plot indicates the Farrellys in revisiting their first success think more is more. In fact theres less less jokes less heart and less of the quirky weirdness that is Carreys home turf (nothing here comes close to the first films kung fu waiter battle). Harry changing an adult Lloyds diaper at the asylum or inane fart bits are just lame. The Farrellys have a rep as incorrigible wild-men thanks to ""Theres Something About Mary"" but their best are the more mild ""Kingpin"" and ""The Three Stooges."" If Carrey seems stuck in time churning out weird faces that no longer amuse then Daniels open-mouthed buffoonery is truly wasted. In the first film it was hard to see the guy from ""Purple Rose of Cairo"" in Harrys shaggy foolishness; now the guy from ""The Newsroom"" similarly disappears but the film lets him down. Jim Carrey (r.) and Jeff Daniels are back for the sequel Dumb and Dumber To. (Hopper Stone SMPSP) It lets idiot movies down too and thats a hard trick to pull off (previously only Jerry Lewis ""Hardly Working"" and some ""Ernest"" movies did that.) From junky production values to the parade of unfunny supporting characters to its lazy energy ""Dumb and Dumber To"" falls on its face. Although had a pratfall like that been here it likely wouldve been messed up too. jneumaiernydailynews.com Catch ""Joe Neumaiers Movie Minute"" throughout the day Thurs. - Sun. on New Yorks WOR 710 AM and at wor710.com.

"Dumb and Dumber To Review Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels Reunited at Last | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Film Review Dumb and Dumber To Andrew Barker Senior Features Writer barkerrant 13 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr November 13 2014 | 0943AM PT Sporadically funny and mostly tedious this 18-years-too-late sequel nonetheless exhibits a puerile purity of purpose. The experience of sitting through ""Dumb and Dumber To"" which reunites stars Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels with directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly 20 years after their maiden voyage to the lower depths of imbecility is something like watching an aging MLB slugger wind down his career in the minor leagues. The stakes are far lower hes slow off the blocks his joints are creaky and his batting average is a pale shadow of what it once was but the swing and the stance still look the same and you cant accuse him of not suiting up. Sporadically very funny mostly very tedious and sometimes truly vile this 18-years-too-late sequel nonetheless exhibits a certain puerile purity of purpose and should accrue healthy profits playing to the nostalgia of the dumb and the dumb at heart. At the risk of applying rose-colored glasses to reconsider a film that aspired to be nothing more than a lobotomized Three Stooges routine the original ""Dumb and Dumber"" possessed a certain je ne sais quoi that distinguished it from its fellow bottom-feeders. Featuring Carrey at the height of his rubbery powers and a pair of first-time filmmakers who were very clearly learning on the job the combination produced a strange sort of fever-dream atmosphere that allowed audiences to laugh at things they knew they probably shouldnt. Though all involved are now old enough to know better a bit of that anarchic spirit remains and the sense of sad obligation that hampers most similar sequels is little in evidence here. Carrey and Daniels certainly appear to be having more fun than most viewers will with Daniels in particular relishing the opportunity to shake off the stern shackles of his role on ""The Newsroom"" and let the fart jokes fly. Lest this reviewer get too misty-eyed describing a film whose first five minutes feature a cat named Butthole eating crystal meth and a man being dragged to and fro by his catheter it must be said that the vast majority of the gags in ""Dumb and Dumber To"" sputter out. Aggressive attempts to create quotable new routines lack much spark and lame callbacks to the first film (""Want to hear the second most annoying sound in the world?"") take up entirely too much space. In truth very few of the jokes here are much sharper than what one would find in a water-treading latter-day Adam Sandler project; theres simply a lot more of them delivered with greater conviction. The plot such as it is is kicked in motion when Harry (Daniels) enlists Lloyd (Carrey) to help him find a kidney donor. The two quickly discover that Harry once sired a love-child with neighborhood slattern Fraida (a game poorly served Kathleen Turner). Now in her 20s Penny (Rachel Melvin) was adopted by famed scientist Dr. Pinchlow (Steve Tom) and her behavior leaves little doubt where the Farrellys come down in the nature-vs.-nurture debate. Before Harry and Lloyd can intercept her at home however shes sent off to deliver a keynote speech at a TED-style conference in El Paso while the good doctors trophy wife (Laurie Holden) and her handyman heavy (Rob Riggle) plot to kill him and make off with his riches. Like the original most of ""Dumb and Dumber To"" takes place during a long road trip to reach her as our heroes are pursued by a criminal conspiracy that they are utterly ill equipped to recognize. Carrey expends substantial energy trying to recapture his manic comic energy of old before his more sincere roles in ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" and ""The Majestic"" left his career in a neither-nor limbo and he largely succeeds through sheer effort alone. His face has lost little of its elasticity and the sight of him messily devouring phallic-shaped foodstuffs will trigger viewers gag reflexes with ruthless precision. In contrast with such lovable oafs as Seth Rogen and Danny McBride who have supplanted him as cinemas man-children du jour Carreys comic instincts still tend toward the sinister and many of this films jokes live or die depending on which side of the cruel-clever divide they fall. With six credited screenwriters -- a credit that initially reads as a meta joke -- the film cant help but stumble upon a few choice lines (""Its all water under the fridge"" ""youre deaf as a bat"") even if one must wade through a lot of guff to find them. Technical credits are rough and ramshackle but if you wandered into ""Dumb and Dumber To"" to study the cinematography the joke is clearly on you.

Ricky from Trailer Park Boys has already said that. Disappointed in the Farrelly brothers. Reply Byronasorus says November 16 2014 at 956 am This review is a joke. Who watches a comedy for the cinematography? And whats wrong with clever cliche reformations woven into the script? Ill give it to you straight - If you liked the original Dumb and Dumber youll love Dumber To. You may even like it more. Albeit a little darker its fantastic Reply Gary says November 15 2014 at 710 am Negative as you speak of this film I wonder if the first film gave you the same reaction? Dont know if you have been a writer that long? Its escapism at a high point. Your critique of the film is a bit funny. But please dont go into comedy you dont seem smart enough. Reply sabata Mou j says November 13 2014 at 210 pm I adolizes the Guy jim carryk. Hes funny in away he makes life simple to be lived . Reply FA says November 13 2014 at 1251 pm A high-brow review? For a low-brow movie? Really? I dont know whats funnier the movie or imagining the tone of voice of this reviewer as he ""critiques"". Reply cc says November 13 2014 at 703 pm Sorry to see you had trouble reading it. Reply Kelby says November 13 2014 at 1128 am What a generous review. Havent seen the film yet but I will now. (Theres nothing like low expectations to set up a happy trip to the theater.) Reply Go back to Canada says November 13 2014 at 1047 am Do not support gun grabber Jim Carrey by paying to see his stupid movie. Reply H.M. says November 13 2014 at 1147 pm Zzzzzzz you limited reactionary wingnuts are indeed sad. And America bar the backwards areas like the one that bred you are tiring of your inflated batshit warnings. Reply theboyx3 says November 13 2014 at 140 pm Ill see it twice just for you. Reply TONY says November 13 2014 at 956 am total waste of money.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Its possible that the half-life of film comedy is five years. ""21 Jump Street"" was world-class hilarious in 2012 and Schmidt and Jenko were 95 percent as funny when they returned in this years ""22 Jump Street."" ""Dumb and Dumber"" that beloved classic was the quality standard of downbeat dimwit humor in 1994. Now after a double-decade gap Lloyd Christmas and Harry Dunne reprise their stoogery in ""Dumb and Dumber To."" The result is simply stupid. This embarrassing revival plays as if the script were written in Comic Sans. Its not that the basic elements are missing. Jim Carrey seems to be seriously aiming for a career comeback as he reprises Lloyd the brain-drained boob who was the nations dumbest dreamboat a generation back. He dusted off Lloyds fragmented front tooth the childhood bowl-cut hairstyle and his love for flatulence. Jeff Daniels embodies Harrys mental and physical awkwardness at one point throwing his 59-year-old body down a hill in a single unbroken shot for giggles. Theres an early sense of nostalgic charm to see them again. Once again Carrey is amusingly aggressive and uncouth; Daniels is friendly and essentially harmless. But like a character here who offers the pair a friendly hug then freaks out when they wont let go the reunion simply outlasts its welcome. When it revisits the first films famously ribald sense of humor (with jokes involving aged co-star Kathleen Turner as a former bed-hopper young co-star Rachel Melvin as her crackbrained daughter and even a bawdy dog) it feels like everyones hormonal clock is unbalanced. DUMB AND DUMBER TO  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for crude and sexual humor partial nudity language and some drug references. The story begins in Rhode Island with Harry marking his 20th anniversary of visiting bearded silent inert Lloyd in his infirmarys outdoor park. Ever helpful he changes the paralyzed patients colostomy sack while holding the full one in his mouth. The films finest moment comes when Lloyd reveals his long-running lethargy was a gag. Harry delighted tries to get his pal out of the hospital fast by yanking out his catheter which wont slip free even when he asks a couple of lawn workers to help. Theres weak continuity in what happens to the reunited village idiots. Harry announces the need of a donated kidney from his 21-year-old long lost little girl Penny (Melvin) whose mother Fraida (Turner) gave her to a brilliant scientist for adoption at birth. Now the girl is representing her dads priceless new discovery at a distant science conference like a dopier version of TED talks. The guys travel cross-country to meet her Lloyd with kinky eagerness under the guidance of a harebrained villain played by Rob Riggle (who was much much much better in the timely ""Jump Street"" series). Along the way there are a handful of laughs if your hands are size Small. When Harry goes through an old pile of unopened mail he smiles ""Oh I made it into Arizona State."" When a brain scanner reveals a morally icky memory of his pubescent childhood he denies it because ""my bed sheets were orange."" Penny who like Harry is sweet and moronic hopes to become a volunteer in India working at ""those leprechaun colonies."" Carrey invents the movies nuttiest solo just by eating a hot dog as if he were a python. But the movie drifts pointlessly through the too-long dream sequence where he fights a ninja army and seduces Penny. Directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly had one writing partner when they created the first ""Dumb and Dumber"" chapter. Here the credits note four Farrelly co-authors who seem to create more problems than jokes. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Comments (2) click to enlarge Dumb and Dumber To Video Rated PG-13  110 minutes  2014 Harry (Jeff Daniels) and Lloyd (Jim Carrey) are back and dumb as/dumber than ever. Seeing the two fiftysomething stars in their idiot haircuts again is a little disconcerting like watching your favorite old band on a desperate reunion tour but this sequel to Dumb amp; Dumber (1994) maintains a respectable laugh quotient. (""Does your friend have Aspergers?"" ""Probably--he doesnt wipe very well."") Rob Riggle adds to the fun as a special-ops assassin whose skintight outfits allow him to blend into the background and Kathleen Turner contributes a winning plus-size parody of her old vamp roles. The audience I saw this with seemed to be having a pretty good time with it though my favorite gag--Harrys admission letter from Arizona State--seemed to fly over everyones heads. Or maybe it hit too close to home. By J.R.
