Orange mans 2nd trial nets life term in killing - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Sentence Orange mans 2nd trial nets life term in killingJuly 10 2009|By Sarah Lundy and Amy L. Edwards Sentinel Staff WritersA judge sentenced a 22-year-old Orange County man to life in prison without parole Thursday in a 2006 fatal shooting during a drug deal gone wrong.Deangelo Conner was convicted last month of first-degree murder armed robbery and two counts of robbery with a firearm.Florida law required Circuit Judge Bob Wattles to sentence Conner to life in prison for the murder conviction.Conner had turned down a 25-year plea offer and took his chances at trial.His first trial ended in a mistrial after jurors were heard discussing the case before it was allowed.Authorities say Conner shot Ricardo Rivera 41 once in the chest July 6 2006.Conner and two others initially set up the meeting as a drug buy but they never intended to pay for anything the prosecution said; the three planned to grab the drugs and run.At one point Conner pulled out a gun and fired at Rivera. Conner told investigators that Rivera was charging toward him and he was merely protecting himself.The jury didnt buy it.Several of Ricardo Riveras relatives attended the sentencing including his children and brother Robert Rivera who read statements from several people.In a statement Ricardo Riveras ex-wife wrote that the hardest thing she has had to do was tell her children they no longer had a father.The woman wrote that her familys hurt will never go away.

But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out?

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

"Mystic River is Clint Eastwoods best film yet. Slate Sign In Sign Up Mystic River is Clint Eastwoods best film yet. Mystic River is Clint Eastwoods best film yet. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Oct. 8 2003 712 PM Youth and Consequences Three men fight off the past in MysticRiver. By David Edelstein Tortured by Mystic Rivers memories Since his directorial debut in 1971 with Play Misty for Me Clint Eastwood has managed to convince a lot of otherwise discerning people that his plodding juiceless movies--which manage to be simultaneously laid-back and heavy-handed--are the work of a daring auteur with a strong moral vision. I have a long way to go before I share (or even comprehend) the view that Eastwood is now to paraphrase the program of the New York Film Festival a titanic artist on par with Hemingway and Shakespeare. But his new film Mystic River (Warner Bros.) in which he doesnt appear is the first time his flat deliberate approach actually enhances his material. Almost every Eastwood movie opens with a floating helicopter shot over a city or small town but here that signature device has a strong connection with what the film is about As the camera glides over the Mystic River toward Boston you can practically see the word ""Fate"" superimposed over the dark waters. Eastwood is still heavy-handed but the mood and tempo are perfect for this particular story They suggest a certain tragic inevitability that flows grimly relentlessly toward us. Advertisement The film has been reverently adapted (by Brian Helgeland) from a 2001 book by Dennis Lehane one of a new breed of urban noir writers who manage to tell you more about how cities work than many so-called literary novelists do. After a series of well-crafted deeply felt but ultimately conventional detective thrillers set in Boston Lehane took a swing at the moon in MysticRiver a book that revolves around a murder investigation but that veers from the procedural into something deeper and more open-ended. The spark came from Lehanes own childhood He once got picked up by two plainclothes cops for street-fighting but realized later that hed never seen their badges--they could have been anyone. In the prologue to Mystic River set in 1975 three boys Jimmy Sean and Dave are writing their names in wet cement when two men claiming to be policemen approach. They order one of them--the less self-assured Dave--into the car and in Lehanes nightmare revision of his own past those men are not cops They rape the boy for four days before he manages to escape. Thats when the real story begins. The bulk of MysticRiver (the book and the movie) is set 25 years later in the Flats (a composite of several working-class neighborhoods north and south of Boston) where those three boys have evolved in dramatically different ways. Jimmy the toughest of the trio is an ex-con who has gone straight and owns a small neighborhood market while Sean has moved in the opposite direction Hes a homicide detective. So far so cliched. The wild card is the rape victim Dave whos neither crooked nor straight; he is as one observer puts it ""damaged goods."" A loving dad and husband hes haunted and unstable as well as marginally employed and neither Jimmy nor Sean can look at him without thinking ""What if it had been me who got in that car?"" The book has all manner of clunky contrivances but you can feel Lehanes excitement as he breaks out of pulp formulas and tests his new freedom. MysticRiver is finally about how that opening violation ripples into the present deforming all the lives in this tight-knit working-class community. It has the range of a classic tragedy. Helgelands script has its thick wads of exposition as well as a few hammy speeches that stop the action cold. But he has done a sterling job of keeping Lehanes emotional beats in place and Eastwoods measured pacing allows you to watch the strands of plot coalesce in agonizingly slow motion. The director wrote the score himself--or at least the melody (Lennie Niehaus orchestrated) which is built around a triad thats meant to suggest how the boys are both bound and driven apart by their terrible history. The mature trio is played by three major actors Sean Penn (Jimmy) Tim Robbins (Dave) and Kevin Bacon (Sean). What brings these characters back into one anothers orbit is the brutal murder of Jimmys exuberant 19-year-old daughter Katie (Emmy Rossum) whos found shot and beaten to death after a night of bar-hopping with girlfriends. As fate (or Fate) would have it the investigating detective is Sean He and his partner Whitey (Laurence Fishburne in a triumphant piece of colorblind casting) have to keep the volatile Jimmy and a pair of local hoods known as the Savage brothers (Kevin Chapman and Adam Nelson) from finding the killer before the police do. And the killer might be closer than they know. Dave watched Jimmys daughter dance rhapsodically on a bar the night she was murdered--watched longingly. When he came home a few hours later to his wife Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden) he was covered in blood. Advertisement Eastwood has never shot anything with the sustained emotional power of the sequence in which Katies body is found. It begins when Sean realizes that an abandoned blood-soaked car belongs to Jimmys daughter at which point Jimmy--in another part of the Flats watching his youngest daughters first communion from which Katie is mysteriously absent--turns slowly to stare at the door of the church then at the police cars racing by. The sequence builds to an unbearable climax shot from overhead in which Jimmy pushes toward his daughters corpse (splayed out in an old bear cage) screaming and weeping barely held back by a line of policemen that seems too puny for this one anguished father. From the start Penn is playing the larger tragedy--the sense that somehow for reasons he doesnt yet know his own sins have led to his daughters murder. For much of the film Eastwood keeps Penn isolated in the frame and the actors stillness is pregnant and scary Jimmy cant be fully himself until hes violent and then when he gives into his emotions he hits notes of animal agony that havent been heard since the young Brando. Hes now the most towering actor of his generation. The movie is a triumph of casting--and of Eastwoods habit of giving his actors (down to the smallest bit part) the room and time to strut their stuff. Bacon holds the formulaic detective plot together while also suggesting the subtle ways that Daves kidnapping left him broken too; and as his harder-headed foil Fishburne gives a beautifully tough and funny performance. Marcia Gay Harden is a miracle of wordless despair Tremulous with loyalty at the start shes quaking with guilt by the finale. As Jimmys wife Annabeth Laura Linney has a Boston alewife accent that sticks a bit in ones ears but her final scene--a Lady Macbeth number in which she powerfully induces her husband to shed his conscience--carries a ferocious charge. Only Tim Robbins Dave threw me out of the movie. I could see him acting and his high droopy singsong reminded me variously of Charles Durning and Buddy Hackett. But I love the way he makes his great height a liability He looks as if he wants to fold in on himself and dissolve. Eastwood hits a lot of wrong notes among them a shot of a child molesters ring that screams anti-Catholic sensationalism and a long speech of Daves about vampires that should have been edited with a stake through the heart. The biggest howler is the subplot involving Seans estranged wife whos in the habit of phoning him at significant times and refusing to speak. Eastwood photographs only the actresss mouth which is bad enough. Worse is that the mouths a weird one shaped like an octopuss. Yet for all its missteps MysticRiver gets the big things right It turns you inside out with grief and it builds to an act of vigilante murder that is nearly impossible to endure. There is an added piquancy In the 60s and 70s Eastwood helped to create the body-count genre in which vigilante action became campy spectacle stripped of consequences and denuded of emotion. Now in MysticRiver he makes death shocking and momentous; he has put the horror back. This is his finest film. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Though Lehane is known as a crime writer the book has larger novelistic ambitions. Depending on how you read it Mystic River is a wistful tale of the unintended consequences of a human tragedy a harrowing vision of the triumph of evil or a heartfelt dissection of the cruelty with which communities create and maintain outcasts. It is also a story of how vigilantes are made and for that reason its easy to imagine the attraction the book held for Clint Eastwood. Notwithstanding his rebirth in the last decade as an elder statesman of socially conscious moviemaking Eastwood remains more in thrall than hed likely admit to the Hobbesian ethos of the Westerns and cop movies that have built his career. His is a deeply reactionary not to say jaundiced view of society as inherently irredeemable unless it be by craggy individualists bearing arms. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Eastwoods articulate charm and gift for knowing self-deprecation have brought him a growing reputation as an intellectual (he winds the ordinarily skeptical Terry Gross around his pinkie every time he appears on Fresh Air) even though his politics and aesthetics differ from Arnold Schwarzeneggers more in style than in substance. The orgiastic burst of gunfire that footnoted Unforgiven one of two outstanding films Eastwood made in the 90s (the other was A Perfect World) gave the lie to his newfound qualms about violence and paved the way for his ambivalent pseudo-critiques of brute force in Absolute Power True Crime and Blood Work. Other than in the entertaining Space Cowboys Eastwoods self-mockery is less a mature ironic rethinking of the stiff-lipped American hero than a form of self-regard a tasty hors doeuvre designed to soften us up for the reiteration of red-blooded manhood as the key to saving the world from its ugly self. No matter how many ""thoughtful"" movies Eastwood makes that egotistical messianism is his passion and remains the secret of his success. Still at 73 years old even Eastwood seems to have realized hes too old for onscreen machismo. With Mystic River hes been wise enough both to remove himself as an actor and to search out stronger material than hes worked with in a while. In any case Eastwoods official status as a screen legend earns every movie he makes the kid-glove treatment -- Mystic River was received at Cannes this year with the usual breathy reverence in part no doubt because of its restrained portrayal of the two crimes that frame the movie both of which unfold mostly offscreen. In the opening scene three small boys write their names in the fast-drying cement of a Boston sidewalk. By the time one of them has reluctantly climbed into a car driven by two burly men claiming to be policemen their characters have been sketched Wildcat Jimmy Markum (his surname inexplicably changed from Lehanes Marcus) and his friend Sean Devine a cautious kid from a more prosperous upper-working-class family refuse to get into the car. Their pathetically eager-to-please acolyte Dave Boyle meekly submits only to return home several days later where hes branded as damaged goods. The action now skips forward to the present where the three now grown men are fulfilling destinies shaped by that one event. Following the death of his first wife ex-convict Jimmy (Sean Penn) has gone straight for the sake of his teenage daughter Katie (Emmy Rossum) and the new family he has formed with his firebrand second wife Annabeth (Laura Linney). As she prepares to elope to Vegas with her boyfriend Brendan (Tom Guiry) Katie is brutally murdered and Dave (nicely underplayed by Tim Robbins) who limps through life sustained only by his love for his young son and his softhearted wife Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden) returns home in the early hours of the morning drenched in blood. The chain between the estranged former friends is completed when Sean (Kevin Bacon) -- a cop whose wife has left him for the reason wives leave cops in movies because he is married to his work and his partner (here Whitey played by Laurence Fishburne) -- is assigned to investigate Katies death.

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm As a whodunit Lehanes novel is clever enough and like all good crime novelists he tarries lovingly over character history and place evoking not just a plot but a hermetic world. Armed with a respectful screenplay by Brian Helgeland Eastwood tags along obediently. Mystic River is suitably atmospheric Henry Bumsteads lovely blue-green production design perfectly captures proletarian Boston with its smoky Irish bars and its wood-frame triple-deckers spilling onto narrow sidewalks. Where Lehanes novel seethes with emotionally charged subtext Eastwoods workmanlike direction feels static -- fatally tasteful embalmed in gravitas -- while his sporadic efforts at dramatic heightening come off as vulgar cliche A brutal beating segues into blinding white light; an anguished talking head is portentously framed in black. Lehane clearly loves the strong loyal women who inhabit his novel along with the emotionally attenuated men who depend upon them without in any way understanding what drives them. Eastwood for all the famed breadth of his romantic experience has never managed to put a female character worth knowing on the screen -- and dont talk to me about Meryl Streep. Even his recent movies tend to nod in the direction of a rote feminism without making a dent in his division of the female gender into scheming vixens and youthful nymphs whose mission in life is to jump his aging bones. For Mystic River Eastwood has cast two of the most capable actresses working today but neither Linney a quietly versatile actress who can rise above being miscast as a loudmouth nor Harden as the fragile Celeste ever really makes it off the page. Lehane treats the three boyhood friends with equal mercy and empathy as he evokes the distinctions within the working classes that lead to different fates -- the gray no-exit dullness of the lumpen life as Dave and Jimmy live it set against the small but significant avenues of upward mobility that lift boys like Sean up and away from their origins. But only one of these men really interests Eastwood and only one brings the movie however briefly to life. Its not Dave -- abject defeated Dave a victim born and made. Nor is it straight-ahead Sean though Bacon plays him with the taut laconic offhandedness of an Eastwood hero a man of few words and fewer visible emotions. It is of course Jimmy the coiled spring (Penn who can do this sort of thing in his sleep plays him to perfection) who for all his efforts to be recognized as upstanding citizen of the year fairly bursts with rage and impulse. Jimmy who wants to run the neighborhood his way. Jimmy who sits tight biding his time for a chance to take the law into his own hands. ""Sometimes I think all three of us got into that car"" Sean murmurs sadly when that distant childhood tragedy has worked its dreadful logic. When at the Columbus Day parade that ends the movie Sean cocks an imaginary gun at Jimmy Jimmy merely grins -- the wolfish grin of a vigilante of a man on his way to becoming Dirty Harry. Jimmy is a sad and scary man but there is a part of Eastwood that seems to enjoy him.

"Bred in the Bone washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Movies Bred in the Bone Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Wednesday October 8 2003 The wages of manhood are at the quiet seething core of ""Mystic River"" Clint Eastwoods somber often elegiac hymn to ritual violence tight-lipped stoicism and territorial pride. Over the course of his 30-year directing career not to mention in his most iconic roles as an actor Eastwood has made something of a study of what it means to be a man at any particular point in American cultural history. From the victim of the sexual revolution in ""Play Misty for Me"" to the superannuated gunfighters and obsolete values of ""Unforgiven"" his movies always seem to be about Men with a capital M. With ""Mystic River"" Eastwood considers not for the first time the cardinal values of loyalty and guilt and shame and strength as they play out against the male tribal culture of violence and emotional repression; the results are explosive heartbreaking tragic on a Shakespearean scale. If ""Mystic River"" is just a bit overplayed a tad too highly pitched it still resonates with grief and fury and feeling. Named for a neighborhood in Boston ""Mystic River"" opens there as three 11-year-old boys are playing street hockey. Bored restless they begin to carve their names in some wet cement on the sidewalk; the third boy Dave doesnt get a chance to finish his which will prove to be prophetic. They are interrupted by two men a cop and a priest by the looks of them who put the fear of God in the boys for defacing public property. Dave is shuttled into the mens car and driven away and he will stay missing for four days enduring unspeakable violence and abuse until he escapes. A few decades later Jimmy (Sean Penn) Sean (Kevin Bacon) and Dave (Tim Robbins) dont see much of each other although they still live in the same neighborhood. When Jimmys 19-year-old daughter is found dead in a nearby park Sean now a state police officer is put on the case which will reunite him with his two old friends. As he investigates the crime he must not only tease out whether Dave is a possible witness or even a suspect but also manage Jimmys grief which threatens to spill over into uncontrolled anger (made more problematic by Jimmys ties to local crime gangs). ""Mystic River"" is essentially a by-the-numbers police procedural (its based on the Dennis Lehane novel of the same name) but in Eastwoods hands it becomes at once a spiritual allegory and psychological indictment. There is a recurrent theme of silence in the film -- his male characters are incapable of explaining or expressing their feelings and their wives brilliantly played by Marcia Gay Harden and Laura Linney arent much better. (Seans wife is seen only when she calls him on the phone and proceeds to give him the silent treatment.) When they do speak his characters almost always say something about feeling alone. Filmed on location in the crowded blue-collar streets of Boston ""Mystic River"" often has the sere loneliness of the most isolated stretches in ""Unforgiven."" A pact seems to have been made on these blue rain-slicked streets behind the facades of the stately but slightly shabby frame houses a wordless pact of denial distance and emotional isolation. ""Hes in for a world of hurt"" an observer says when Jimmys daughters body is discovered. Its a world that Penn inhabits totally and without abandon in a performance that is understandably one of the most talked about of the season. Penn almost never puts a foot wrong whatever he does and his portrayal of the volcanic Jimmy is no exception; Eastwood films him iconically in stylized set pieces of male rage. Its a moving electrifying turn from Penn but he is ably matched by his co-stars both male and female. Robbinss portrayal of a man haunted by childhood sexual abuse might be the most accomplished of his career; his entire face seems to change as the lumpish inexpressive Dave displaying jowls and heft that have never been there before. Similarly Bacon as the audiences guide through the tight-knit tribal backwaters of Irish Boston toes the delicate line his character must walk between being of his roots and apart from them. His moral decision when it comes will be clear neither to him nor his friends -- or necessarily to filmgoers. For its preoccupations with men and their most mythic weaknesses ""Mystic River"" winds up being controlled by its women who may seem to let their mates take center stage in the narrative but who turn out to have been quietly driving the storys tragedy all along. Viewers who might have seen Harden as just the shrewish mother-to-be in John Sayless ""Casa de los Babys"" wont recognize her as Daves mousy terrified wife; Linney as Jimmys wife Annabeth seems to come out of nowhere at the end to deliver a speech worthy of Lady Macbeth. But look closely at her performance throughout the movie and you see glimpses of a will far more steely -- and frightening -- than her supportive role might suggest. In addition to eliciting outstanding performances from his cast Eastwood has assembled a characteristically classy production team behind the camera including screenwriter Brian Helgeland (""L.A. Confidential"") and cinematographer Tom Stern who has lit ""Mystic Rivers"" street corners dives and waterfront streets in evocatively damp shades of blue and gray. Indeed Eastwoods only real misstep -- and a rare one for him -- is with his own musical score a series of mournful heavily orchestrated pieces whose weightiness and sacramental overtones are completely gratuitous in view of the overwhelming emotion on screen. If ""Mystic Rivers"" somber morally ambiguous portrait of manhood has anything in spades its gravitas. Mystic River (137 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for language and violence.

We learn in a prologue that his character a regular guy named Dave was lured into a kidnappers car as a child while his two buddies helplessly looked on. Dave escaped after several days but what happened to him during that dark interval is written indelibly on his adult face. The light catches his eyes making them hollow and glassy and he speaks in whispers and mumbles a grown-up child afraid of what might be lurking in the shadows. Daves antithesis is Jimmy (Sean Penn) a former hood so sharp his face looks carved from ice. Though the two drifted apart after Daves kidnapping they remain in the same blue-collar Boston neighborhood and decades later their fates intertwine again. Jimmys teenage daughter Katie (Emmy Rossum) is found murdered on the same evening that Dave comes home with blood on his hands. The third member of their childhood trio Sean (Kevin Bacon) is the cop assigned to investigate Katies death and the three soon close into a tight triangle eyeing each other like cats in a dark alley knowing a fight could erupt at any time. Movie review 1/2 ""Mystic River"" with Sean Penn Tim Robbins Kevin Bacon Laurence Fishburne Marcia Gay Harden Laura Linney. Directed by Clint Eastwood from a screenplay by Brian Helgeland based on the novel by Dennis Lehane. 140 minutes. Rated R for language and violence. Pacific Place (expanding to additional theaters Oct. 15). lt; Essentially ""Mystic River"" is about ghosts; about how three men continue to be haunted by those three boys they once were frozen in a moment of time at which everything changed. ""Sometimes I think all three of us got into that car"" muses Sean; it barely needs to be said as that childhood day is the unspoken bond between the men. And like Eastwoods great ""Unforgiven"" its about violence and vengeance and the moral consequences thereof. Jimmy vows to avenge his daughter aided by his Lady Macbeth-like wife (Laura Linney focused and terrifying in a late scene) but this story isnt quite as black-and-white as it seems. Dennis Lehanes novel is an elegantly written crime thriller that fairly buzzes with detail and Brian Helgeland as he did with James Ellroys ""L.A. Confidential"" has pared it down into a taut screenplay full of room for actors to fill in the blanks. And Eastwood directing his 24th film marshals a dream cast with the confidence of a symphony conductor who knows hes got all virtuosos in his orchestra. (Speaking of which Eastwood also composed this movies majestic score played by the Boston Symphony Orchestra.) Penn Bacon and Robbins are all electric and each is given an equally strong partner to play off. Penn and Linney a tough-as-nails couple united in grief radiate icy anger; you tense up when theyre on the screen. Marcia Gay Harden as Daves troubled wife Celeste is a perfect physical match for Robbins; both have made their faces soft and almost unformed both have frightened childlike eyes. Laurence Fishburne as Bacons cop partner brings a welcome breeziness. Even the tiny roles seem perfectly cast Jason Kelly playing Jimmy as a child has Penns lawless cold-eyed quality down pat. (Only Rossum playing a character who seems too idealized strikes a slightly false note.) ""Mystic River"" is full of details that stay with you the almost painful vulnerability of a small boy (Daves son) with a huge backpack; the rasping vowels of working-class Bostonians; the way Bacon brushes back the dead girls hair ever so gently; the shadows on Robbins face at night forming lines and creases like a roadmap to his threadbare life. At the very end of the film all assemble to watch a neighborhood street parade and the various characters exchange looks; each capturing a world of meaning. The movie has ended but the story continues; you wish you could stay with them a little longer.

Wallace) Photo MERIE W. WALLACE Clint Eastwood spins a masterly tale of kinship memory and murder 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Mystic River Mystery. Starring Sean Penn Tim Robbins Kevin Bacon Marcia Gay Harden. Directed by Clint Eastwood. Written by Brian Helgeland from the novel by Dennis Lehane. (R. 137 minutes. At Bay Area theaters). Most people by the time they reach middle age have closed emotional ranks. The immediacy of family and job concerns mean most childhood ties have long since fallen away. ""Mystic River"" the chilling superbly acted new mystery from director Clint Eastwood explores how formative friendships snake their way back anyway through guilt the subconscious and more vividly the recurrence of tragedy. Jimmy (Sean Penn) Dave (Tim Robbins) and Sean (Kevin Bacon) still live in the same working-class Boston neighborhood where they grew up. But they have drifted each haunted by the memory of Daves abduction by child molesters 25 years before as his two friends watched helpless. Theyre thrown together again as adults by the slaying of Jimmys 19-year-old daughter. Eastwood lets the resulting murder investigation unfold less as a thriller than as an intricately observed character study. At nearly 2 1/2 hours ""Mystic River"" proves that a mystery need not be taut to be riveting. Screenwriter Brian Helgeland and novelist Dennis Lehane deserve plenty of credit but the triumph is Eastwoods. He orchestrates pitch-perfect performances down to the tiniest role as each grace note inches the story forward. At ease in the realm of the criminal mind Eastwood enlisted two fellow actor-directors of similar sensibility to lead the cast. Its no surprise that Penn and his ""Dead Man Walking"" director Robbins deliver the films most powerful moments in their scenes together. Married to cousins Jimmy and Dave reunite for the funeral of Jimmys daughter. Yet the actors are so gifted at subtext that Penns grieving father seems to also be comforting the friend he turned his back on. A tacit apology has been offered and accepted. The moment underscores how the theft of one boys childhood robbed all three of unfettered youth. In an early scene where the young Dave is returned to his parents a neighborhood wag remarks that the kid ""looks like damaged goods."" In this tough 1970s Boston neighborhood inhabited by drunks and petty criminals he will be regarded as just that by others and by himself. Dave shows the most outward signs of trouble as Robbins adopts the slack jaw and downcast gaze of a man frozen in his worst moment. Jimmys response to the boys childhood trauma can be inferred from his reaction to his present one. A tattooed and flinty ex-con Penns Jimmy swallows his despair in favor of a stony determination to hunt down his daughters killer. The third boy Bacons Sean has become another sort of enforcer -- a homicide detective reluctantly assigned to the murder case. The presence of Bacon evokes the similarly themed but inferior 1996 film ""Sleepers"" in which he played tormentor to a group of boys who grew up to avenge themselves. Hes a good guy here but as Bacons calibrated tenseness reveals just as conflicted as his two friends. So emotionally removed that his pregnant wife has left him hes wary of reinvolving himself with the old gang especially for the occasion of another sad event. When he questions Jimmy after the slaying the past crime figures as prominently as the current one. Jimmy wonders if however indirectly being a bystander in his friends abduction led to his daughters murder. If hed been the one taken instead of Dave he reasons he ""would not have had the juice"" to approach his daughters beautiful mother and his child never would have been born. We see the daughter only briefly before her death but Eastwood has ensured that every performance counts. Emmy Rossum brings a vivacity to her few scenes allowing Penn to show a touching fatherly affection. The girl is not a device but a flesh-and-blood character making her death more jarring. Eastwood vet Laura Linney (""Absolute Power"") reveals intriguing new shadings as Jimmys second wife and the dead girls stepmother and Laurence Fishburne brings savvy and the pictures only light moments to his role as Bacons wiseacre partner. Even cameo performances make an impact. As the mother of the dead girls boyfriend Jenny OHara wearing a tattered housecoat and scowl shows a lifetime of bitterness in five minutes of screen time. Among the fine supporting performances however its Marcia Gay Hardens work as Daves wife that really stays with you. Wary skittish and consumed by the prospect of unending grief Hardens character shows the lasting impact of childhood tragedy even one experienced secondhand and well after the fact.

Or visit Popular Alerts for suggestions. Manage alerts | What is this? (CNN) -- Clint Eastwoods latest film ""Mystic River"" a stark and brooding drama explores the dark side of human nature and the frailty of the safe world we would all like to think we live in but dont. The story begins in flashback with the three characters -- friends Sean Devine Jimmy Markum and Dave Boyle -- growing up in a tough section of Boston. The boys are playing together on the street on day when their innocence comes to an abrupt end. Dave is kidnapped and sexually abused by two men pretending to be police officers. Twenty-five years later when Jimmys (Sean Penn) 19-year-old daughter is found murdered the three are suddenly reunited by the tragedy. The investigation creeps closer and closer to its surprise conclusion past demons that threaten to destroy all involved. Now a Boston police officer Sean (Kevin Bacon) is assigned to the case along with a partner played by Laurence Fishburne. Sean is now faced with the task of keeping Jimmy under control as the enraged father attempts to solve the case on his own. Laura Linney plays Jimmys wife Annabeth with a great sense of inner strength and reserve. Haunted Dave (Tim Robbins) who never really recovered from his savage ordeal is still haunted by the graphic images that continue to replay in his mind. However he has managed to carve out a life for himself and is now married to Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden) and has a son of his own. Laura Linney plays Penns wife in ""Mystic River."" But when circumstantial evidences starts drifting towards Dave his fragile grip on reality begins to slip as he sees his marriage and future begin to unravel. Based on the bestselling book of the same name by Dennis Lehane Eastwood -- along with screenwriter Brian Helgeland (""L.A. Confidential"") -- has crafted a riveting story with complex situations and extremely well defined characters. Eastwoods spare approach to filmmaking in which less is always more gives this film a grim reality and a deep sense of intimacy. In many ways the film almost seems like a documentary and Boston itself -- along with the actual Mystic River -- are as much characters as the human principals. It also helps that Eastwood has three of the industrys finest actors at his service. Each man is damaged in his own way. and their interwoven histories provide a magnificent subtext to this deeply moving story. Harden and Linney also deliver top-notch performances. ""Mystic River"" seems destined to be a contender -- in many categories -- for next years Academy Awards. Its Eastwoods best directorial work since ""Unforgiven."" ""Mystic River"" opens in limited release on Wednesday October 8 and is rated R. ""Mystic River"" is a Warner Bros. film. Warner Bros. is a unit of Time Warner as is CNN.

Mystic River Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2003) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/mystic-river-2003,200,mysticriver18,mysticriver,rogerebert
"Mystic River | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; mystic-river ) Mystic River (United States 2003) A movie review by James Berardinelli With Mystic River Clint Eastwood has rebounded nicely from the failure of his mediocre previous effort Blood Work. Absent from the screen but behind the camera for the first time since Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil Eastwood concentrates all of his efforts on producing and directing and the result is the Hollywood icons best effort in nearly a decade. The script written by Brian Helgeland remains reasonably faithful to Dennis Lehanes novel. This is a powerful tale of crime guilt and punishment - a drama that incorporates elements of whodunit mystery/thrillers and police procedurals with a richly textured three-character play. Those three characters are Jimmy (Sean Penn) Sean (Kevin Bacon) and Dave (Tim Robbins). When we first meet them in a quiet Boston suburb they are kids playing street hockey. A car drives up and a gruff man gets out and identifies himself as a cop. After intimidating them (they had been ""defacing"" public property by scrawling their names in wet cement) he forces Dave to get into the car then drives off. As it turns out the man is a pedophile not a cop and Dave is not seen for four days after he escapes from his abductors. The bulk of the story takes place some 30 years later. Over the years Jimmy Sean and Dave have grown apart. Jimmy a grocery store owner with a criminal background is married to his second wife Annabeth (Laura Linney) and has three daughters. The eldest of these Katie (Emmy Rossum) is the apple of his eye. Sean a police detective for the Massachusetts State PD is estranged from his wife. Dave who has never fully recovered from his abduction has a wife Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden) and a young son. Then one night events bring these three old friends back into each others spheres. Katie is found murdered and Sean and his partner Whitey (Laurence Fishburne) are the investigating officers. One of the chief suspects turns out to be Dave who returned home late on the night of the murder with blood on his hands and an implausible alibi. Meanwhile as Sean begins the official investigation Jimmy makes inquiries on his own. He is determined to find the murderer before the police so that he can mete out his own brand of justice. It is clear from the beginning that Mystic River has aspirations to be more than a conventional murder mystery. The added layer of complexity arises through the psychological depth of the characters and the importance of their past relationship. Although a gulf of time has separated the lives of these men that single childhood event has forged a bond nothing can sever. The image of Dave looking forlornly through the backseat window as he is driven away will haunt Jimmy and Sean to their dying days. Mystic River would not be the experience it is without the raw powerhouse performance of Sean Penn whose grief and rage are so forcefully expressed that they bring tears to the eyes. Eastwood shows us just enough of the tender relationship between Katie and her father to make it genuinely painful when he has to identify her body at the morgue. Penn is justly regarded by many critics as one of Americas top actors and his work in Mystic River will only enhance that reputation. This is the second most effective performance on Penns resume following only Dead Man Walking. Tim Robbins is generally regarded as a better director than an actor but given the right role (as in The Shawshank Redemption) he can seem perfectly cast. Dave whose emotions and (to a degree) personality were neutered in childhood is such a part. Robbins is consistently low-key and doesnt do much in the way of emoting and thats precisely whats required in this case. Likewise Kevin Bacons approach to Sean is understated since the character does his best to remain emotionally detached from the situation (as befits a good cop). There are occasional cracks in Seans faASSade and Bacon allows us to catch glimpses of his inner turmoil. Many times in character-based movies like this its the supporting performers who make the difference between a good film and a great one. In this case Eastwood has chosen his entire cast wisely. The actors filling secondary roles - Laurence Fishburne Laura Linney Marcia Gay Harden and young Tom Guiry (as Katies secret boyfriend) - all do solid work taking some of the burden off the top-billed trio. Mystic River has only one misstep and that occurs at the conclusion (and is reflective of problems with the books final pages). Instead of ending cleanly at the point when everything is in place for the rolling of the credits the movie drags on for two unfortunate unnecessary scenes. This superfluous epilogue not only pads the running length but commits minor character assassination and disallows the possibility of things concluding on a dramatically high note. It is Eastwood and editor Joel Coxs only blunder. (This is the kind of material one would expect to see as an ""alternate/rejected ending"" on a DVD.) Getting the tone right for such a complex genre-crossing story is a tricky thing but Eastwood masters it. Mystic River is suffused by a slightly ominous sad atmosphere. There are none of the cheesy shocks one often expects from murder mysteries. One could easily argue that although plot is important Eastwood puts a greater emphasis on character. The movie moves from one tragedy to a greater one and we understand how every event impacts each of the protagonists. With an intelligent insightful screenplay and a riveting key performance Eastwood has combined his cinematic ingredients in a mixture that cries out for Oscar consideration. Mystic River is haunting and melancholy and the portraits it paints of Jimmy Dave and Sean will stay with you after you have left the theater. In a time when the goal of most movies is to offer instant gratification with no aftertaste this quality should be both valued and praised.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr A Mystic River Genre Drama Mystery and Thriller; Starring Kevin Bacon Laurence Fishburne Marcia Gay Harden Laura Linney Sean Penn Tim Robbins Spencer Treat Clark Emmy Rossum Thomas Guiry; Director Clint Eastwood; Author Brian Helgeland; Release Date Limited 10/08/2003; Release Date Wide 10/15/2003; Runtime (in minutes) 137; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted October 2 2003 -- 1200 AM EDT Mystic River is named for a ribbon of water that ties off the blue-collar Boston neighborhood in which Clint Eastwoods magnificent movie is set. Jimmy Markum (Sean Penn) Dave Boyle (Tim Robbins) and Sean Devine (Kevin Bacon) grew up on its banks tight pals and we see them first as kids playing street hockey and talking Red Sox. But then something happens - men who pretend to be cops pull up in a car and drive Dave away. And four days later when he escapes childhood is over - not only for the abducted boy but also for the two who watched him go. The past shapes the present as powerfully as the river itself shapes the emotional and physical landscape of Dennis Lehanes fine novel and using a clean slicing script by Brian Helgeland (an Oscar winner for ""L.A. Confidential"") Eastwood directs ""Mystic River"" with an invigorated grace and gravitas. This is a true American beauty of a movie a tale of men and their bonds told by and for adults who value the old-fashioned Hollywood-studio notion of narrative. Its also a beaut of a chamber piece for the best of American acting which Id like to think cannot be disconnected from the movies enduring fashion-proof style of storytelling - or from the director as architect. Let others meditate on Eastwood and his gallery of antiheroes and justice seekers; Im more moved by the control and authority with which the director coaxed such deep inspired readings from his cast - expect Oscar nominations - and the delicacy with which he sets the characters in their particular but universal world of hurt. Jimmy Dave and Sean have long drifted apart when they are reconnected in their 30s by a new crime the murder of Jimmys oldest daughter; at its simplest ""Mystic River"" is a classic whodunit. Dave has stayed close to the ground and for all his lumbering height lives folded up and hemmed in married to fluttery worried Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden a breathtaking study in fearful wifely distrust) with whom he has a young son. Dave looks like the kind of man who will never cross the Charlestown Bridge to the bigger city and Robbins in one of the great hunkered-down performances of his career bears Daves crushing load of memory on beautifully sagging shoulders framed by the camera in middle-distance shots that rarely allow Dave space or privacy. Jimmy married to Celestes cousin Annabeth (Laura Linney fierce as any Livia ancient or modern) runs a corner grocery store that doesnt reflect his standing as a tough guy local fixer and former gang leader. Jimmy doesnt need to cross any bridge because hes made his burg the world. And whenever Eastwood looks to the character he spreads the landscape out long and horizontal pinning Jimmy down on his big map of nowhere but freeing Penns huge restless thespian energies to find suitable release. (Most of the crew including invaluable production designer Henry Bumstead and cinematographer Tom Stern are veterans of Team Eastwood.) Bacons Sean meanwhile has crossed the bridge - at one point we actually see him in a noisy traffic snarl. He has become a police detective working with a partner (Laurence Fishburne generously recessive). But Seans personal failures express themselves in pockets of silence - as when his wife who has left him phones but doesnt say a word. To complement Bacons embodiment of a sealed-up man Eastwood likes to push in tight almost crowding Bacons full length out of the frame. (When the wife calls we just see her silent lipsticked mouth so close are we to Seans emotional muteness.) ""Mystic River"" is a murder mystery. Its a psychological study How does childhood trauma shape adult lives? And right up the directors alley the drama is also a study in gender treacheries - as much about the women who were not there when one boy was hurt 25 years ago as about the men who are together again in the old neighborhood now their wives and daughters unsafe or unreliable. Eastwood who also wrote the resonant chordal theme with its deep ground bass communicates as much with sound and camera movement as with words and performance and there are moments when I felt myself on the banks of tears stirred by the panorama of the vulnerable neighborhood by the water or the way a corner grocery looks exposed and flimsy on an overcast day. At times I could even convince myself that Eastwood directs our eyes up down and across like a grand genuflection hes that much the composer of this wonderful American psalm.

This adaptation of Dennis Lehanes 2001 novel about old friends in Bostons working-class Irish neighborhood finds Clint Eastwood near the top of his directorial game with first-rate actors. Could be a class fall release for Warner Bros. ""Mystic River"" is a complex deeply ambiguous study of lifelong ties moral accountability and the flukes of destiny. This full-bodied adaptation of Dennis Lehanes involved and involving 2001 bestselling crime novel about old friends in Bostons working-class Irish neighborhood finds Clint Eastwood near the top of his directorial game with a cast of first-rate actors. The dark disturbing view of human nature and the relentless procession of tragic events will pose the main hurdle for public acceptance but strong reviews the directors and authors names and vigorous marketing could put this over as a class fall release for Warner Bros. Eastwood and screenwriter Brian Helgeland have followed Lehanes lead in using a time-tested dramatic format -- childhood pals who have ended up on different sides of the law -- to examine themes regarding the wages of violence and crime that have been at the center of some of the directors best pictures including ""Unforgiven"" and ""A Perfect World"" and to draw some equivocal characters in compelling shades of gray. The clear-eyed objectivity and alertness with which the film presents its drama and milieu call to mind Otto Preminger in his ""Anatomy of a Murder"" period. Staged in classically coherent and straightforward style narrative pivots on two traumatic events separated by about 30 years. While playing on the street kids Sean Devine and Jimmy Markum stand fearfully by as their friend Dave is ordered into a car by two threatening guys posing as cops. Although he miraculously escapes and returns home some days later Daves sexual abuse at the hands of the men has marked him for life. Decades later the three have grown apart. Sean (Kevin Bacon) has worked his way up to homicide detective Dave (Tim Robbins) is a subdued fellow with a wife Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden) son and patchy career while Jimmy (Sean Penn) is a salt-of-the-earth former criminal and convict who looks to have reformed and is the proprietor of a local market husband to a good woman Annabeth (Laura Linney) and father of three girls. One of his daughters Katie (Emmy Rossum) is an attractive vivacious 19-year-old who becomes an urban statistic when after a night of carousing with two girlfriends and on the eve of eloping with a secret boyfriend she is brutally murdered her body hidden in a local park. Jimmys love for Katie was total and he vows on her grave to catch the killer before the cops do. Penns deeply emotional scenes surrounding the murder -- anticipating the worst when he realizes Katie is missing trying to get past police lines as the body is still being identified keeping his emotions in check while being interrogated by Sean and his partner Whitey (Laurence Fishburne) -- represent prime thesping opportunities and the intense actor makes the most of them by underplaying more than one might expect. Penn is sufficiently dominant to make the corked tension within Jimmy become the center of the picture. Given the strange circumstances of the killing -- Katie was both shot and beaten and no plausible motives can be imagined -- the search for a suspect is frustrating. Pics main narrative thread consists of a slow-motion race between Jimmy who uses his thug in-laws the aptly named Savage brothers to track down neighborhood information and Sean and Whitey who are annoyed that Seans old friend is running his own parallel investigation. Before long however everyones suspicions fall upon Dave who arrived home hours after the murder took place with bloody injuries and unconvincing stories about how he got them. Fact that a second person was killed the same night in the vicinity raises further questions and Daves expressions of insecurity and self-doubt lead a distraught Celeste to confess to Jimmy that she believes her husband killed Katie. The fatal gears this confession sets in motion leads to a climax and aftermath fraught with terrible ironies regret and loss as well as a profound cautionary signal about that hallmark of Eastwood films extra-legal justice. Underlying the thick narrative which scripter Helgeland has skillfully boiled down from Lehanes nearly 500 pages are psychological insights that often pivot on how the characters have and havent changed since childhood. Katies spilled blood awakens in Jimmy old behaviors he thought he had left behind. Sean acts as though he were still married although his pregnant wife left months before and places silent phone calls to him. But the biggest head case is obviously Dave haunted by his childhood molestation in ways that are just surfacing decades later. Tale also offers peripheral observations about such other matters as the subtle status distinctions within the longtime Irish neighborhood now being overtaken by gentrification and unemphatic notations on generational and racial issues (no fuss at all is made over the change from the novel making the Whitey character black). Eastwood approaches this narratively tangled and emotionally loaded material with calm confidence; in his 24th film as a director he exerts an evenhanded control that puts the materials many layers and assorted elements in satisfying perspective and balance without any feeling of manipulation. Perhaps because Eastwood has done similar scenes so many times before and also because the investigative field remains relatively barren for much of the time the police procedural interludes have a borderline routine feel and pics widescreen compositions are not as sharp or forcefully framed as in some of the directors previous pics. Casting is immaculate. Penn is in top form as the reformed hood whose basic instincts overtake him. Robbins surprises with his vulnerability as an unusually inward character still bleeding from old wounds that will never heal. Bacon plays Sean rather like Eastwood himself might have done 30 years back although Fishburne as his partner has little opportunity to lend anything beyond his considerable presence to a one-dimensional character. Harden notches up the anxiety level as it dawns on her what her husband might have done while Linney economically conveys the strength of a wife whos always there for her man when he needs her. Eastwoods ""The Good the Bad and the Ugly"" costar Eli Wallach is in for an unbilled cameo as a liquor store owner. The director who before has made song contributions to some of his pictures this time composed the score which is dominated by a swellingly dramatic main theme. Pic takes good advantage of locations in Boston where all lensing was done.
