Starring Julia Roberts Richard Gere Joan Cusack and Rita Wilson. Directed by Garry Marshall. (PG. 106 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In a movie season woozy on special effects a big-tease sex drama and intense sci-fi horrifics theres nothing like Julia Roberts stunning smile in an over-easy love story to nail down what Hollywood does best -- romantic comedies. ""Runaway Bride"" opening today at theaters everywhere has everything light breezy and fun going for it. Suddenly its the movie to beat. The film reteams nine years later ""Pretty Woman"" stars Roberts and Richard Gere with director Garry Marshall a veteran formula comedy man who knows how to sprinkle on the charm when he has a good script. Here he has one and with his sure hand he lets everything ride the rhythm of a dozen or more warm funny moments. Thats plenty to turn the whole shebang into a pleasant experience. One could hardly ask for a better summer pairing than Roberts terrific at playing it folksy and Gere smart at playing the arrogant crusty man-of-the-world with a needy inner self. The predictable story hinges on a couple of tangy twists and is loaded with characters so enjoyable theyd make great neighbors. Roberts and Gere (now gray- haired and a bit shaggy) click here and thats the key to this films success -- sparks of disdain leading to sparks of love. This works so well because the two obviously relish what theyre doing together. ""Runaway Bride"" doesnt intend to make intellectual demands even as it forces a few leaps of faith newspaper columnists so popular that they are accosted by readers on the street; a car that breaks down because it was inadvertently fueled with leaded gas. The PG-rated film so clean it squeaks (take the kids) simply aims to stir up laughs and keep folks smiling. Its a sure box-office winner. Roberts as plucky but fickle small-town beauty Maggie Carpenter has a habit of getting engaged and leaving prospective grooms -- three in fact -- stranded at the church. She lives in cozy fictional Hale Md. where she runs her dads hardware store and designs lamps on the side. Her cold-feet approach to nuptials has made her notorious in the gorgeous Eastern Shore region where most of the movie is set. Gere as cynical New Yorker Ike Graham is a fast-talking columnist (for USA Today) who frequently uses his Hit amp; Run column to take swipes at women. Ike is stuck for a column one day when he learns of a woman in Maryland who keeps dumping guys at the altar. So Ike punches out a column attacking her. Apparently they read USA Today in Maryland and Maggie has become furious about what Ike has said of her fickle ways. So she fires back a threatening letter to the editor claiming he has misrepresented her. So Ike travels to Maryland to dig deeper into the Maggie Carpenter story. Here the film turns up the warmth. Ike enters a wonderfully embracing Small Town America of quaint thoroughfares happy families thriving main-street businesses and things so apple-pie that a barbershop quartet regularly performs in the town square. The film gazes lovingly at this community while Ike and Maggie meet and scrap with each other. Shes engaged to benedict elect No. 4 and the whole town is holding its breath to see what will happen. Meantime shes contemptuous of Ike nosing around. Ike is in his element as a reporter snooping into her life by ingratiating himself with family and friends who provide him with morsels for his next report on the woman who ""dresses men up as grooms and devours them."" Wonderful characters keep the movie from gagging on sweetness. They include Peggy (the always bright Joan Cusack) as Maggies best friend; Maggies heavy-drinking dad Walter (Paul Dooley); and fourth groom-to-be Bob (Christopher Meloni) who uses visualization techniques to keep Maggie thinking she might go through with their wedding. ""Runaway Bride"" does get into deeper issues -- the fathers alcoholism and the fact that the lovely vital Maggie actually has a serious problem with making commitments. When it dawns on her that she is the butt of too many cruel jokes in town the film turns poignant. But the delightful Roberts nudges her character toward the just-plain-silly. In one of several wonderfully goofy turns she contorts her famous face to mug a duck-billed platypus. This is a girl just having fun and its contagious. ..

An ultracommercial mainstream romantic comedy that delivers all the laughs and smiles it intends to this Par release can hardly miss at the B.O. even though some have questioned opening it so close to ""Notting Hill."" Having waited nine years before following up their 1990 smash ""Pretty Woman"" Julia Roberts Richard Gere and director Garry Marshall score again with ""Runaway Bride."" An ultracommercial mainstream romantic comedy that delivers all the laughs and smiles it intends to this Par release can hardly miss at the B.O. even though some have questioned opening it so close to Roberts early summer hit ""Notting Hill."" But what are fans of the biggest female star in the world going to do -- not see this one after having seen and liked her last picture? Not likely. Even though the film has all the earmarks of a highly tailored package -- two studios 10 producers roles molded specifically for major stars -- all that matters in the end is that the central idea is quite clever and appealing and that the charm meter is turned up all the way. Men and women should be equally diverted by the allure of the thesps and the thats-the-way-America-ought-to-be small-town setting and PG-rated pic could easily draw out old-timers and infrequent moviegoers who feel they dont make em like this anymore. After opening with the startling sight of Roberts in a wedding gown fleeing across an autumnal landscape on a galloping horse action turns to New York where in a scene that real-life journalists will find shocking USA Today columnist Ike Graham (Gere) deals with his imminent deadline by hanging out in a bar. Fortunately a young man tells him a good story about a Maryland woman with the chronic habit of leaving fiances at the altar. Unfortunately the resulting column is so riddled with errors that his boss (and ex-wife) Ellie (Rita Wilson) fires him. Given a shot at vindication via a freelance magazine piece if he can get the full and real story about this woman Ike heads for Hale Md. a town so folksy and idyllic that Ike says ""I think Im in Mayberry."" Approaching her fourth attempted wedding to local high school sports coach Bob (Christopher Meloni) the following Sunday Maggie Carpenter (Roberts) who runs a hardware store is none too happy to have Ike lurking around town and cozying up to her father (Paul Dooley) who thinks nothing of showing the curious visitor the (quite funny) videotaped highlights of his daughters three abortive ceremonies. Ike gets around interviewing everyone about Maggie especially her first two jilted beaux now a rock n roll garage mechanic and a Catholic priest. Ike also points out to Maggies best friend Peggy (Joan Cusack) that Maggie is being quite flirtatious with Peggys husband and when the truth of her unthinking behavior man-eater reputation and notoriety as a one-woman spectator sport sinks in Maggie -- at pics halfway point -- sobers up and agrees to cooperate with the writer. This of course leads to prolonged proximity which in turn leads to the unavoidable recognition of mutual attraction. These second-half developments could have been coy and cloying but screenwriters Josann McGibbon and Sara Parriott undercut their predictability with some shrewd adept moves notably in a scene in which Coach Bobs attempt to get Maggie to ""visualize"" her wedding via a church rehearsal backfires when Ike stands in for the groom. By the time Maggies fourth wedding actually begins her phobia has become so famous that the ceremony is a media event with all eyes on her every gesture to glean an answer to the question ""Will she or wont she?"" Speaking of gestures Roberts delivers some magical ones here -- a scene in which the sweating bride keeps herself cool by moving along with a revolving fan is lovely and the actresss gradually widening lopsided half-smile and her pregnant hesitation while walking down the aisle are indelible star moments for her. A tale like this can end only one way but it takes an agreeably circuitous route getting there. Roberts has a perfect role in Maggie an open lovable slightly neurotic but capable girl-next-door -- she even knows whats wrong with her mans car when it breaks down -- and shes perfect in it. Her face and feelings are accessible without being obvious she can be goofy sporty or amorous with ease and shes radiant almost regardless of circumstances. Working with Roberts has a positive effect on Gere; perhaps realizing that shes prettier than he is the actor completely drops the preening posing self-satisfied air he affects when hes the biggest star in a picture. He delivers a loose disarming quite appealing portrait of a man whos made a number of mistakes and looks to be an underachiever as he enters middle age. Cusack Wilson and Hector Elizondo the latter as Ellies husband are excellent in colorful supporting roles while Meloni gets plenty of comic mileage out of his part as the big jock in town. Director Marshalls timing and sense of fun are in full evidence. Technically pic looks immaculate on the widescreen with Mark Friedbergs production design augmenting the locations provided by Berlin a town on the Eastern Shore of Maryland all smoothly captured by lenser Stuart Dryburgh.

"Runaway Bride | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; runaway-bride ) Runaway Bride (United States 1999) A movie review by James Berardinelli For years now there have been discussions about a sequel to the surprise 1990 romantic comedy blockbuster Pretty Woman. Aside from once again propelling Roy Orbisons title tune up the pop charts that film had the distinction of establishing Julia Roberts as an A-list star. When Pretty Woman was released she was hardly an unknown having already appeared in the likes of Mystic Pizza and Steel Magnolias but her on-screen interpretation of a modern-day Cinderella rocketed her into a higher orbit. Pretty Woman turned into a box office favorite (making nearly half a billion dollars worldwide) and has since become a video staple. Ultimately the involved parties could not agree on a storyline for the long-anticipated sequel so they went in another direction re-uniting director Garry Marshall with his two leads for Runaway Bride an uninspired romantic comedy about a commitment-fearful woman (Roberts) who spars with then falls for a cynical writer (Richard Gere). The best thing the movie has going for it is a built-in audience; theres not much in the screenplay which follows the expected formulas to get excited about. Little that transpires during the course of Runaway Bride is credible and although some suspension of disbelief is necessary for nearly every love story this film stretches things too far. Only die-hard romantics will find any charm beneath Marshalls often inept manipulation. The saving grace of Runaway Bride is Julia Roberts whose sparkling smile and shining personality rescue individual scenes - although she cant save the project as a whole. Roberts gives a genuine heartfelt performance while everyone else drifts through on autopilot. Richard Gere is as flat as usual (although to be fair he is more animated than in Pretty Woman where he could have been mistaken for a mobile telephone pole). His low-key approach doesnt serve his character well and the lack of energy is especially noticeable in his scenes with Roberts. She carries them and the chemistry that was evident in Pretty Woman is seen here only in short erratic spurts - not enough to build a romance on. Its also worth noting that with his white hair and haggard visage Gere looks more like Roberts father than a potential husband. These two are less believable as a screen couple than Catherine Zeta Jones and Sean Connery (primarily due to Connerys overabundance of charisma - something that Gere lacks). The story opens in New York City where hotshot USA Today columnist Ike Graham (Gere) is seeking an inspiration for his latest ""bitter diatribe about women."" He finds it in a familiar watering hole where a disillusioned man tells him about Maggie Carpenter (Roberts) a young woman in rural Hale Maryland who has left three men at the altar and is now preparing to try for a fourth time. Relying exclusively on the mans tale Ike submits a one-sided piece riddled with inaccuracies. Several days later when an irate letter arrives from Maggie Ike is fired. However a friend promises him the chance to publish an article in GQ if he can get the real scoop on Maggie and perhaps catch her in the act of jilting a fourth husband-to-be. So Ike heads south ingratiates himself with the locals and begins to follow Maggie around town. At first she is irritated by his unwanted attention but as the two get to know each other better a strange thing happens. Ike becomes Maggies staunchest defender and she begins to wonder if her perfect man is really the one she intends to stand next to during the ceremony. In general Im a sucker for love stories but I never accepted the relationship between Maggie and Ike. These two should despise each other. The wounds they have dealt out should result in a War of the Roses not a Pretty Woman 2. If a man wrote a slanderous article about me my family and friends would not greet him with open arms. And if a woman got me fired and ruined my reputation I wouldnt follow her around trying to find out what makes her tick. Some contrivances are expected in a motion picture like this but Runaway Bride mounts one upon another until like a poorly balanced house of cards they all come tumbling down. There isnt a real character in this film and thats one of its most serious flaws. The leads act as they do because theyre responding to the demands of the plot. Their every action is determined not by the requirements of human nature but by the need for a certain number of complications before the happy ending. The supporting players have even less integrity or reason for being. Maggies best friend Peggy (Joan Cusack) is on hand for comic relief and Bob (Paul Dooley) serves no purpose beyond being the primary romantic stumbling block that keeps Maggie and Ike apart until the movies final quarter. Frankly the only one I cared about was Maggie and that was more because of Roberts performance than anything found in the script. There are other things that annoyed me about this film. The dialogue in particular is a sore spot. The conversations in Runaway Bride are tedious; the characters speak in cliches and rarely have much to say thats of interest to each other or the audience. Then theres the ending... While I wont reveal the specifics here suffice it to say that I despised the plot contortions of the final fifteen minutes. This kind of stuff isnt new to the genre but its especially irritating in the way its presented here. As a satire or a black comedy Runaway Bride could have teemed with promise. As a feel-good effort its a bust. Director Garry Marshall does not have the track record to inspire confidence. One glance at his recent resume which includes the likes of The Other Sister Dear God and Exit to Eden reveals a filmmaker who should not be allowed behind the camera. With Runaway Bride he delivers what we have a right to expect - a clumsy motion picture that strives so hard for the perfect romantic ending that it triggers a gag reflex along the way.

Theres something uniquely American about that I-know-its-bad-for-me-but-Ill-have-a-piece-anyway enthusiasm. From the outset the guilty-pleasure aspect of Pretty Woman was the tiara of its appeal. In its candified way the movie invited female viewers to fantasize about ""roles"" as if they were projecting themselves onto an adult Barbie. Wed had rebel-yell feminists wed had Madonna the insolent vamp goddess and now we had Julia Roberts the girl with the gorgeous wax lips who proved that you could be a feminist a vamp and a princess all at the same time. Its hardly a surprise that she became the only truly mythic screen idol of the decade. For me Pretty Woman was a guilty displeasure. In the sixth issue of this magazine I panned the quintessential chick flick and I have never stopped getting razzed about it. For the record folks I have seen it again (twice in fact) and let me confess I was a grouch. The movies a charmer. I actually liked Julia the first time around (hey I thought she was good in Mystic Pizza) but what I didnt see was the affection beneath the gruffness in Richard Gere and the way it enriched Roberts glow. She has been a star ever since but never quite as radiant as in that moment when she was becoming a star. Runaway Bride a screwball comedy so genial its downright cautious reunites Roberts and Gere with Garry Marshall the director of Pretty Woman. Roberts plays Maggie Carpenter a hardware-store clerk who lives in one of those rustic modern-movie small towns that look like Bedford Falls by way of The Truman Show. Maggie has become notorious for ditching her fiances (three so far) at the altar. As soon as the moment arrives for her to tie the knot a look of dazed panic crosses her face and she scurries from the church or gallops away on horseback. Silly? Insane? Yes but in a very homespun neo-traditional way. Its easy to imagine say Carole Lombard playing this sort of mad-dash heroine; shed have been prancing out that church door in a grand neurotic tizzy. But what exactly sends Maggie running? In Runaway Bride her itch to flee is presented not as a daffy whim but as the movies (thin) mystery -- a desperate tic of self-actualization. It draws the attention of Ike Graham (Gere) a New York-based macho-caveman-shtick USA Today columnist who does a speculative story on Maggie and gets fired for exaggerating her predicament (though from what we can see he pretty much nails it). He then shows up in town to save his career by doing a freelance magazine profile of this new-style female commitment-phobe. In a sense Maggie in her wedding escapes makes a vintage male choice compulsively lunging for freedom over bondage. Her current betrothed is a sweet but blockish phys-ed teacher (Christopher Meloni) who is dying to take her to Mount Everest. Maggie for one looks like she belongs in a much warmer place. In Runaway Bride Roberts and Gere flirt and spar with a kind of insouciant talk-show aplomb beaming at each others perfect skin. The performers have chemistry all right but its almost too smooth too foregone; theres no acid-and-base combustion. If we sensed that Maggie were secretly happy that Ike had teased out her wedding fears there might be some sexy tension between them. Maggies matrimonial craziness though funny as it is when its showcased in video clips seems to have very little connection to the Julia Roberts who strolls through the rest of the movie tranquil velvety in her confidence preternaturally poised. Maggie and Ike draw together and what we see is a pair of characters who seem made for each other because theyre the only two people in town who carry themselves like world-famous Hollywood celebrities. The difference between Pretty Woman and Runaway Bride is that we can no longer buy Roberts in her tearful romantic-melancholy mode. It seems vaguely patronizing now as it did in Notting Hill when she played a star who claimed to be ""just a girl."" Runaway Bride never comes close to chick-flick heaven but its timid meandering pleasantness does allow it to tap into one fantasy. The real romance isnt between Roberts and Gere but between Roberts and the trappings of matrimony itself. The movie isnt a love story exactly -- its pure sweet wedding porn.
