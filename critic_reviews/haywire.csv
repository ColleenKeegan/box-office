The star is the monotonic but arresting Gina Carano a mixed-martial-arts champion given to single-minded pummelings of her opponents. She plays Mallory a badass espionage agent who moves out on her smug employer/boyfriend (Ewan McGregor) but accepts a couple of final jobs for old times sake. Never a good idea. Most of the film is a flashback relayed to a discombobulated witness (Michael Angarano)  whom she has more or less kidnapped  to her latest brawl which enables Soderbergh (working from a screenplay by Lem Dobbs) to hop among time periods and continents as is his peripatetic wont. When hes not doing his tricky-syntax thing hes sitting back and watching his leading lady fight  the point of this particular cinematic exercise. As one of the few major directors who works as his own cinematographer (under the name Peter Andrews) Soderbergh is unusually sensitive to how close the camera needs to get to his actors. Militating against the hyperkinetic Bourne-picture fashion of sticking ones lens in the middle of melees Soderbergh keeps a respectful distance allowing us to ogle his star from stem to stern. Shes something to see. Carano doesnt move like an actor but an athlete  someone trained to channel emotion rather than exhibit it to conserve energy rather than expend it. (There are similarities to a young Chuck Norris which I dont mean as an insult.) The fights are staged and shot so that we can almost but not quite calculate her next move along with her. Shes always faster  and meaner  than we expect ever ready to swivel kick out a limb and squeeze a windpipe shut between rock-hard thighs. Soderbergh tends to get one big idea  a thesis idea  per film and stick with it even when a touch more flexibility would help. Here its that non-kinetic camera which hes so wedded to that parts of the film seem underenergized like a cheap seventies or early eighties picture youd catch at two in the morning on Cinemaxs tenth most popular channel. Does he have to have so much drab integrity? Couldnt there be just one high-octane head-rocking close-up to put a nice brutal button on something? And what of the (presumed) off-screen finish of the most hateful baddie? Is Soderbergh too proud to throw us a little red meat? This isnt Solaris Soderbergh did reportedly fiddle in postproduction with Caranos voice which never sounded to me as if it were coming from her head. But I liked her  and I say that not just because I dont want to get beaten up. Shes overdefended in interesting ways. The A- and high-B-listers (McGregor Michael Fassbender Michael Douglas Bill Paxton Antonio Banderas) in the cast are obviously taking small parts to up their hipster quotients but Fassbender is striking (in both senses) as an Irish agent who might or might not have a hidden agenda. He does some lovin he does some fightin he does some psychoanalyzin he does some more fightin But he has never had a bedroom scene like the one he has with Gina Carano. -- David Edelstein Advertisement Top 10 Movies Star Trek Beyond The Secret Life of Pets Ghostbusters Lights Out Ice Age Collision Course Finding Dory The Legend of Tarzan Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates Hillarys America The Secret History of the Democratic Party The Infiltrator Advertising On The Set of Jill Soloways I Love Dick Divorce Insecure and Westworld Get Fall Premiere Dates on HBO The Larry Sanders Show Is Coming to HBO Streaming Outlets in September Avengers Infinity War Doesnt Want Infinite Films Is Now Just a Standalone Film TV Review BoJack Horseman Gucci Mane Is Better Than Hes Been in Years Absolutely Fabulous The Movie Is Only Semi-Fab Copyright (c) 2016 New York Media LLC.

In theaters on January 20 2012. Photo Credit Five Continents Imports/ advertisement | advertise on newsday Watching Gina Carano as freelance secret agent Mallory Kane strangle a man with her upper thighs is just one of many pleasures to be found in ""Haywire"" Steven Soderberghs coolly brutal and slyly funny return to the action genre. Carano and her partner appear to be doing well something else -- but lets just say that he never gets to enjoy the afterglow. Carano a mixed martial arts fighter in one of her first acting roles puts some major muscle into Mallory a former Marine turned mercenary. With her broad shoulders and powerful legs she pulls off the kind of stunts that a willowy Kate Beckinsale or Angelina Jolie never could One baddie watches in amazement (as do we) as Mallory floats toward the ceiling and magically pins him to a wall; another guy she simply mows down with the velocity of a runaway Hummer. ""Dont think of her as a woman"" one character warns. ""That would be a mistake."" Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? The plot concerns a botched rescue operation spearheaded by Mallorys former employer Kenneth (Ewan McGregor); a Spanish kingpin of some sort (Antonio Banderas winking throughout) and a government bureaucrat named Coblenz (a droll Michael Douglas). But its mostly an excuse to watch Carano go mano-a-mano against male aggressors like her former cohort Aaron (Channing Tatum) and the handsome but untrustworthy Paul (Michael Fassbender). Soderberghs long takes make these close-combat scenes feel breathtakingly real with head cracks so visceral youll wince in sympathy. You may be asking Can Carano act? Not yet -- shes more comfortable moving than talking. Nevertheless she has an authentic tomboy persona that most action heroines lack. When told to gussy up for a fancy party (as female movie spies must) Mallory objects ""I dont wear the dress."" You dont doubt it.

Mixed Martial ArtsCarana McGregor in Haywire Keeping it real by doing the fight thing Newsday Tweets from Newsday/newsday-staff In ""Haywire"" Oscar-winning director Steven Soderbergh reimagines the spy genre within the confines of physical realism. Rather than employ technology that audiences have grown accustomed to -- stunt doubles quick film cuts wire work -- Soderbergh opted to approach the genre with a real-life fighter (mixed-martial-arts champ Gina Carano) as his lead. ""I really wanted to make a spy movie that wasnt a fantasy in which the scale of it was very human"" said Soderbergh. ""Then I saw Gina on TV and I thought She is [James] Bond just in a different context."" With little more than that idea in his head Soderbergh first arranged to meet Carano in summer 2009 one week after Carano lost her first mixed-martial-arts fight. Sporting a black eye and a downtrodden attitude Carano reluctantly picked up Soderbergh from a train station in San Diego where she was living. ""I didnt want to talk to anybody see anybody"" said Carano who was surprised when their meeting turned into a four-hour lunch. ""We had this normal conversation. He was feeling me out. He wanted to know what kind of person I am. And I didnt have any preconceived notions of him because I didnt really know what a director really was.""

Comments click to enlarge Haywire Video Rated R  92 minutes  2012 Steven Soderbergh has announced that hell soon retire from directing to become a painter and this international thriller--his 23rd feature since 1989--registers as the work of someone whos become both very good at and very bored with his job. Mixed-martial-arts fighter Gina Carano stars as a freelance commando who goes rogue after being double-crossed by her employers her gender providing the only antidote to a crushingly generic plot. Theres a good deal of pleasure to be had in the clockwork precision of her hand-to-hand combat which Soderbergh often shoots in profile to showcase her wall-climbing backflips. The story surrounding it is comparably smooth skilled and mechanical though a lot less memorable.

Thats been the practice with plenty of other athletes-turned-actors and it makes a certain amount of business sense. Why waste a good screenplay and a good director on someone who might not be a good actor? But Haywire shows that our mothers were right anything worth doing is worth doing well. Carano indeed is nothing special as an actress -- but darned if it matters when shes supported by a killer screenplay a sharp cast and Steven Soderberghs unmistakably sly mordant direction. They could have put a robot in the lead (as long as it could fight) and still ended up with a blissfully entertaining 93 minutes of butt-kicking and snark. Carano plays Mallory Kane a highly skilled mercenary who works for an unnamed company that is frequently contracted by the U.S. government to perform sensitive dangerous missions like hostage extractions. But we dont know any of that at first. What we know at first is that Mallory is in a breakfast diner in upstate New York speaking casually but intensely with a man named Aaron (Channing Tatum) who is evidently a colleague of some kind. The smart whirling screenplay -- by Lem Dobbs who wrote another fantastic Soderbergh film The Limey -- hooks us immediately by hinting at the characters shared history. They talk about what happened in Barcelona what happened in Dublin what ""he"" (whoever ""he"" is) told Aaron to say to Mallory. We dont know whats going on but our instincts tell us finding out is going to be a lot of fun. Our instincts are correct. With an innocent bystander (Michael Angarano) as her witness and audience the on-the-run Mallory spends the first two-thirds of the film catching us up on what already happened. You dont want to know the details from me of course but I can tell you there was a mission a double-cross and the other sorts of complications you expect to find in an espionage caper. The players include Mallorys boss and former lover Kenneth (Ewan McGregor); a Spanish client named Rodrigo (Antonio Banderas); a British secret agent (Michael Fassbender) with whom Mallory did a job; an older businessman called Coblenz (Michael Douglas); and Mallorys soldier-turned-novelist father (Bill Paxton). On paper (or on the computer screen where you just read it) nothing about that outline sounds notable. Even the fact that the chief butt-kicker is a female girl lady woman is barely newsworthy. But several things elevate the film to well-above-average almost-even-great status. Soderbergh has a knack demonstrated especially in the Oceans movies for being inventive without showing off and Haywire has this in spades. Infused with the directors cool jazzy style its complemented perfectly by Dobbs effortlessly droll dialogue and the casts eagerness to have some slick well-organized fun. Despite those strengths its possible that what viewers will enjoy most are the many many scenes of people beating the crap out of each other. Soderbergh doesnt disappoint here either taking full advantage of Caranos real-life combat skills to deliver smashing sequences of marvelous violence. This is some of the most entertaining and cleanly choreographed hand-to-hand fighting Ive seen in a while and Soderbergh is careful not to diminish the fun by letting it get vicious or brutal. Could Carano carry a movie that required more nuanced acting than this one does? Hard to say. She could definitely carry a few more Mallory Kane films though and Ill be happy to watch them if she does.

"Haywire review Making more from less |       NJ.com comments Haywire review Making more from less Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on January 20 2012 at 735 AM View/Post Comments Claudette BariusMixed martial arts athlete Gina Carano becomes a big-screen action hero in ""Haywire."" It sounds a bit like an art students trick Can you create a recognizable portrait of someone with 12 lines? With 10? Six? How minimal can you make things and still make them work? If its a dare its one Steven Soderbergh has accepted. His ""Haywire"" is -- or could have been -- a standard thriller. International assassin gets set up escapes the trap thats been set for her then tries to engineer one for the villain. But then Soderbergh -- and screenwriter Lem Dobbs who gave him the similarly simplified ""The Limey"" -- erase all the extraneous bits of style and color. (If ""Mission Impossible -- Ghost Protocol"" was a fancy top-shelf cocktail this is Polish vodka neat.) So the film starts with our heroine Mallory Kane already being chased and fills us in -- sort of -- with flashbacks. But it always seems as if the filmmakers are holding something back and we have to figure the important stuff out on the run. Just like Mallory. If a filmmaker is going to go the minimalist route though he or she had better make sure that for once less is more -- and not simply less. Any reduction in plot or character needs a compensating increase in atmosphere or action. Of course Soderbergh gets that. He ensures the film bounces around a bit from big-city Europe to small-town America. Hes also assembled a good cast of clever male actors including Antonio Banderas as a wily spymaster and Michael Fassbender as a coldly lethal assassin. Far less experienced is the one actress in the cast Soderberghs star Gina Carano. But as a mixed martial-arts athlete shes already a real-life action hero -- and Soderbergh smartly plays to that authenticity by shooting her fight scenes as cleanly as he can. Out of respect to the films keep-it-simple ethos though -- or maybe just his leads limited range -- Soderbergh hasnt given Carano much to do except fight and look slightly impatient with the other characters. Its as if every scene is another cage match to be gotten through. That leaves the film a little hollow and Caranos future acting career a bit of a question. The best action stars were actors first; the second best were athletes who developed a persona or at least learned how to deliver a bad quip. The other lower tiers however were crowded with buff-but-blank performers like Cynthia Rothrock; unless Carano is willing to settle for that shes going to need to bring more to the party -- a bit of wounded pride some sass or sarcasm even just a sense of humor. In its minimal way though at least ""Haywire"" shows what Soderbergh could have done with that once-promising ""Man From U.N.C.L.E"" project and shows off Caranos breathtaking fight skills. And maybe just maybe reveals the beginnings of a new bare-knuckle star. Ratings note The film contains extreme violence and strong language. Haywire (R) Relativity (93 min.) Directed by Steven Soderbergh. With Gina Carano Antonio Banderas Michael Fassbender. Now playing in New Jersey.

His latest ""Haywire"" sees Soderbergh operating in Gritty 60s/70s Crime Thriller Mode; like ""The Limey"" also written by ""Haywire"" scribe Lem Dobbs its the kind of film that hearkens back to lean-and-mean revenge movies like ""Get Carter"" and ""Point Blank."" But with famous faces like Michael Douglas Antonio Banderas Ewan McGregor Michael Fassbender Channing Tatum and Bill Paxton in the cast the film also scratches the directors All-Star itch. Top billing goes to first-time actress Gina Carano a champion in the world of Mixed Martial Arts and a veteran of ""American Gladiators."" And while she may not be the most seasoned of actresses the decidedly un-slick vibe she brings to the movie actually works in her favor; shes playing a somewhat emotionally disengaged hired gun so its not like the character has full access to her emotions either. What Carano does bring to the role is a ferocity and physical presence that makes her more than the match of the many men she flattens like pancakes over the course of the movie. Carano is to violence in ""Haywire"" what porn star Sasha Grey was to sex in ""The Girlfriend Experience"" a previous example of Soderbergh casting a non-traditional leading lady to interesting ends. Carano stars as Mallory whom we first see trekking across the frozen wasteland of upstate New York. At a diner she has a rendezvous with Aaron (Channing Tatum) who has been instructed to bring her in and when she refuses the two of them get into a knock-down-drag-out male-on-female fight the likes we havent really seen since Russ Meyers classic ""Faster Pussycat Kill Kill"" Hapless by-stander Scott (Michael Angarano) comes to Mallorys aid and she commandeers his car. As the two drive off Mallory tells him -- and the audience -- just whats going on a tale that involves her work as hired muscle for the government and her betrayal by her boss and ex-boyfriend Kenneth (McGregor). The plot of ""Haywire"" is essentially one enormous McGuffin that allows Carano ample opportunities for fight and/or flight. The nearly-wordless sequence in which Mallory eludes Irish authorities over several city blocks (sometimes she uses the front door other times she leaps from roof to roof) winds up just as exciting as the many scenes in which Carano connects fist or foot to face. Audiences are more likely to leave the theater remembering Carano and Michael Fassbender walloping the tar out of each other in a glass-shattering bone-crunching hotel room fight than debating the finer points of the plot or any of the performances. But what ""Haywire"" lacks in artifice it more than makes up for with adrenaline and bravado. Carano may or may not have a film career ahead of her but for the 93 minutes of ""Haywire"" theres no question that shes a movie star. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

By Dana Stevens Channing Tatum and Gina Carano in Haywire Claudette Barius. (c) 2011 Five Continents Imports. All rights reserved. Click on the audio player below to listen to Slates Spoiler Special podcast on Haywire after youve seen the movie. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Also in Slate read Jessica Groses interview with Haywire star Gina Carano. Graham the soft-spoken emotionally chilly voyeur played by James Spader in Steven Soderberghs 1989 debut Sex Lies and Videotape got off on filming women as they revealed their most intimate stories. Over the course of his long prolific stylistically diverse career Soderbergh himself has been known to train a Graham-like gaze on his female subjects most notably in The Girlfriend Experience (2009) which featured the thinking mans porn star Sasha Grey as a high-end Manhattan prostitute. For his most recent film the curiously unengaging action thriller Haywire (Relativity Media) Soderbergh has shifted his focus to the pretty immobile face of Gina Carano a mixed martial arts champion making her acting debut as the inscrutable black-ops ninja Mallory Kane. Advertisement Caranos impassive visage and uninflected voice may not express much but her big beautiful powerfully athletic body gets the message across This is not a woman whose wrong side it behooves you to get on. Before the movies first scene is over her fellow operative Aaron (Channing Tatum) has learned that lesson the hard way as Mallory breaks his arm in a nasty hand-to-hand battle in an upstate New York diner. After dispatching with this nuisance Mallory takes another diner customer hostage and in the course of the multipart police chase that follows fills him in on the back story She and Aaron worked together on a job in Barcelona rescuing a Chinese dissident (Anthony Brandon Wong) at the behest of a shady client (Antonio Banderas). Both Mallorys boss Kenneth (Ewan MacGregor) and her U.S. government contact Coblenz (Michael Douglas) seem to share a secret about the true nature of the Barcelona operation (one that the audience wont understand until the films final moments if then.) So when shes paired with an Irish superspy (Michael Fassbender in a disappointingly brief appearance) for a second overseas mission Mallory cant shake the sense that something fishy is afoot. Much of this spy-on-spy double-crossing is hard to follow (the screenplay is by Lem Dobbs who also wrote Soderberghs satisfying revenge thriller The Limey). But Haywires real raison detre isnt skullduggery but skullcrackery. The spy story is a flimsy pretext for watching Gina Carano kick punch and choke the living daylights out of every guy on the premises--and unlike many ""girls kick ass"" movies this time its the actresss sturdy real-life legs that are delivering the painful-looking kicks rather than those of a stunt double. The no-holds-barred woman-on-man fight scenes are exhilarating at first especially an extended hotel-room brawl between Carano and Fassbender that playfully illustrates the similarities between a good fight and a good roll in the hay. (Even the strung-out sex addict Fassbender played in Shame never had to contend with being asphyxiated by a pair of female thighs.) But an hour in still with little grasp of either what Mallorys mission was or why she was so driven to fulfill it I started to lose patience with Soderberghs apparent certainty that no audience could get enough of watching Caranos motionless face in close-up. The steely-eyed super-assassin is a character type that works only when  played by an actor with the depth to suggest a complex play of emotion behind those eyes. Though Carano isnt without a certain glowering charisma her flat line readings and apparent discomfort with dialogue-heavy exchanges make her seem like a refugee from a different schlockier movie the kind of low-budget straight-to-video MMA rock-em-sock-em that might pop up on late-night basic cable and charm you with its rough-hewn amateurism and animal high spirits. As Haywires long-seeming 92 minutes limped by I found myself wishing I was watching that movie instead. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jan. 20 2012 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 224PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Country USA Language English Theres a popcorn-spitting funny slapstick moment in Steven Soderberghs mischievous trifle Haywire where Gina Carano the amazonian brunette is in her cocktail dress with Michael Fassbenders head squeezed between her thighs so hard his face looks like a grape about to pop. Its not clear whether were supposed to pity or envy him. Screen grab from the online trailer for Steven Soderberghs ""Haywire"" starring Gina Carano Ewan McGregor and Michael Fassbender Movies Haywire The official trailer Anyone who has watched sixties and seventies exploitation flicks with stars like Pam Grier or Russ Meyers muse Tura Satana knows audiences enjoy powerful-looking women beating the stuffing out of bad guys. Haywire is Soderberghs 25{+t}{+h} film in a diverse career (though actually finished before last falls Contagion) and its such a self-conscious genre exercise it should probably be enclosed in quotation marks as his ""girl action"" film. Carano a mixed-martial-arts star makes her film debut as the lead in this all-star all-male cast (Fassbender Michael Douglas Matthieu Kassovitz Antonio Banderas and Ewan McGregor as sundry spy types). She stars as Mallory Kane a black-ops agent working for a private contractor (McGregor). Like so many agents in recent films she gets betrayed by her superiors and is set on a path of vindication. Screenwriter Lem Dobbs ( Kafka The Limey) offers one clever twist on the formula with a flashback structure. After being assaulted at a rural New York diner a young woman demolishes her attacker and hijacks a car from a startled young owner named Scott (Michael Angarano). As she drives away she tells the young man what has led her to this moment. It started with a job in Barcelona where Mallory was contracted to rescue a Chinese dissident journalist. Directly thereafter she was sent to Dublin as the ""eye candy"" escort to a MI6 operative Paul (Fassbender) posing as half of a jet-setting power couple. After an elaborate set-piece in a mansion where Mallory finds evidence that the Barcelona assignment was a fraud things between her and Paul culminate in the hotel-room battle. Realizing she has been set up Mallory barely has time to demolish an Irish SWAT team before heading back to the United States to seek explanations and vengeance. Then the flashback comes to an abrupt end during a police chase through the forest (along with an unfortunate woodland Bambi). She abandons Scott with instructions to get her story out and heads off to join her father (Bill Paxton) in his sprawling modernist mansion. A former marine whos now a Tom Clancy-style novelist Dad lets Mallory use his home as the theatre for her next series of take-downs. Serving as his own director of photography under the pseudonym Peter Andrews Soderbergh picks his angles artfully and allows Carano to demonstrate her arsenal of acrobatic fighting tricks in extended no-cheating single takes. The fight scenes are music free the better to appreciate the thwacking and grunting. In between David Grosss funk-jazz score enhances the vintage feel. Soderbergh has explained that his idea was to have Carano ""beat her way through the cast"" of men who do what they can to lend juice to their two-dimensional characters. The question of whether Carano can actually act is moot. Its enough that she has a commanding presence and two good expressions - warily friendly or glaring which makes her like a much prettier Charles Bronson. Her one distinctive actress-like skill in the film is her smoky cocktail lounge voice though that turns out to have been digitally altered to sound more alluring. Hand it to a wily indie veteran like Soderbergh to find a fresh twist to an old genre The fighting isnt faked but the acting is.

Starring Channing Tatum Ewan McGregor Michael Douglas Michael Fassbender Gina Carano Antonio Banderas Bill Paxton Michael Angarano Director Steven Soderbergh Running time 133 Release Opened Jan 20 2012  Editorial Review Quiet restraint of a hit girlBy Ann HornadayFriday Jan 20 2012Mallory Kane joins Lisbeth Salander and Margaret Thatcher as the latest tough-girl movie heroine by leaving a trail of carnage sulphur and various male body parts in her wake in ""Haywire."" Played by real-life mixed martial arts champion Gina Carano Mallory is a steely smoky-voiced creation a mix of Caranos authentic chops in the ring and pure male pulp fantasy. Its debatable whether Lisbeth Maggie and Mallory qualify as feminist standard-bearers - each defines herself chiefly by men either as tormentors or champions - but theres no doubt that watching Carano out-kick out-punch and out-smart a roster of buff actors delivers a certain compensatory frisson. It seems like just yesterday we were wringing our hands about the sociopolitical implications of Hit Girl waging her profane campaign of purple-haired mayhem. They grow up so fast. One of the reasons ""Haywire"" is such a pleasure to watch is that its director Steven Soderbergh doesnt overplay the films hear-me-roar subversions. Temperamentally hes an understater and he approaches his first foray into pure action with the same evenhanded cool he lends to every genre he has ever tackled. ""Haywire"" possesses a lean unfussy style from the blown-out lighting (reminiscent of the back-lit haze that bathed ""The Informant"") to fight sequences that Soderbergh stages with a minimum of unnecessary flourish or fanfare. Mallorys encounters unfold not in a series of cool whiplash edits set to awesome techno music but simply as images often with no music or dialogue (one of the finest examples of the pared-down aesthetic can be seen in a refreshingly non-bombastic rescue mission). Just why is she fighting? That isnt immediately clear certainly not in a ""Haywires"" pulverizing opening sequence that begins with Mallory taking a pot of boiling water to the face and ending with her slamming a guys head into a diner stool. It emerges that Mallory a former Marine has something to do with a Blackwater-esque private contractor and a black ops mission gone wonky; as the tale spins out it will take her from Barcelona and San Diego and Dublin to Upstate New York New Mexico and Majorca kicking the backsides of characters who may or may not include those played by Channing Tatum Michael Fassbender Ewan McGregor Antonio Banderas and Michael Douglas. In casting Carano Soderbergh continues a recent trend of building movies around non-professionals who have caught his eye; as a screen presence shes light-years more compelling than porn star Sasha Grey featured in Soderberghs misfire ""The Girlfriend Experience."" Caranos not a great actress but she doesnt need to be in a movie that as conceived by screenwriter Lem Dobbs (who wrote Soderberghs ""The Limey"") doesnt get bogged down in psychology or humanizing back stories. Instead ""Haywire"" simply gives audiences what they came to see bruising fight sequences set up and executed with economy skill and one or two genuine jaw-dropping jolts. (And the film has its share of those one delivered not by a human cast member but by an unexpected four-footed friend.) With its un-glam visuals and weirdly tacky sound design (Caranos voice was digitally altered and has been mixed to pop out with jarring obviousness) ""Haywire"" stays true to its low-rent B-movie principles right down to the fast strong and quietly competent heroine at its center. In fact the only thing ""Haywire"" doesnt live up to is its title with its intimations of hysteria and wanton destruction. Mallory may unleash her share of chaos but its always under control.Contains some violence.

Haywire"" is a wannabe or rather a wanna-B and that B is for ""Bourne."" As each imitator comes and (rapidly) goes my appreciation for the best superspy franchise deepens. Even top directors -- in this case Steven Soderbergh -- cant figure out the trick. If you dont mind a baffling plot unexplored characters and a so-what ending though the movie is watchable thanks to Soderberghs skittery flair and some ace dialogue. A mixed martial arts fighter named Gina Carano gets her first starring role as Mallory an undercover assassin and does not waste the opportunity. Considerably sexier than the typical stalk of celery that passes for a she-killer these days she deploys icy glances and fast moves with the verve of Jennifer Lopez in ""Out of Sight."" (Lopezs subsequent career proved that like most performers she can easily be non-excellent in non-Soderbergh movies.) A prologue at a diner in snowy upstate New York leads to a confrontation with a fellow spook (Channing Tatum) and a long drive with a helper/hostage (Michael Angarano). Naturally Mallory tells this random stranger everything about her secret back story involving missions in Barcelona and Dublin. Angarano is merely comic relief who never does anything funny as well as a really awkward method for delivering exposition to the audience. When hes off-screen youll forget about him. Youll also forget about him when hes on-screen since he means nothing. As Mallory explains her trips to Spain and Ireland I had somewhere between one-sixteenth and three-eighths of a clue what was going on. (By the time I started to get wise the movie was 30 seconds from being over.) All were really supposed to know is that shes cool and she trusts no one except maybe her dad a fellow ex-Marine (Bill Paxton). And what is his role? Hanging around in New Mexico waiting for the screenplay to give him something to do which it never quite does. Higher-ups in Washington (Ewan McGregor Michael Douglas) compete for Mallorys services occasioning some chatter that scintillation-wise is roughly on the level of postal regulations. Theres some blather about being on a private contract as opposed to being in the employ of the government. Theres some chin-wag about the ""essential element clause"" and hazardous-duty bonuses. You get the feeling someones going to whip out a pension-benefits chart. At least Douglas looks good and has some tart lines courtesy of writer Lem Dobbs who in the 1990s did the fragmented thriller ""The Limey."" The point of the movie is the look of the action scenes which have a tangy realness and a surprising patience. Long takes of for instance Mallory sprinting or evading cops in Dublin give you a sense of her determination and the fights are well-choreographed. Soderbergh loathes cliche but at times the contrarian way is also the wrong way as when he bungles a shootout by keeping his camera safely tucked behind it. In one of the most engaging scenes Michael Fassbender checks in as a new teammate. (He needs ""eye candy"" and when Mallory bristles she is told ""Youre the eye"" -- huh?) She gets to show off her silky evening-wear and this is one professional fighter who cleans up nice. Her ripped stockings caress thighs that in a moment of improvisation can be used to asphyxiate a foe. Not since Graham Chapman was executed by a flock of half-naked roller-derby girls in ""Monty Pythons The Meaning of Life"" was death so congenial to its victim.

Bordering on convoluted it works best when in combat mode.By Claudette Barius Relativity MediaMMA fighter Gina Carano is a smart fit as the rough-and-tumble star of the covert spy thriller Haywire.EnlargeCloseBy Claudette Barius Relativity MediaMMA fighter Gina Carano is a smart fit as the rough-and-tumble star of the covert spy thriller Haywire.Sponsored LinksReal-life mixed martial arts fighting champion Gina Carano makes a particularly believable rough-and-tumble covert ops agent. Her style is reminiscent of 70s star Pam Grier or a particularly ferocious Bond girl though the film aspires to be in the clever vein of the Bourne trilogy. Director Steven Soderbergh re-teams here with Lem Dobbs screenwriter of his 1999 film The Limey.Briskly paced action sequences are riveting and Caranos charisma physicality and daring keep the adrenaline high and the clashes captivating. She plays the fierce Mallory Kane a spy who goes rogue when she realizes higher-level operatives she trusted have framed her. Her life is in jeopardy throughout though the full contours of the dangers she faces are kept vague. Scenes barrel at the audience at a breakneck pace and chases are heart-pounding.BLOG Gina Carano expresses herself in HaywireVIDEO McGregor and Tatum go Haywire in L.A.A former Marine Kane thinks shes on the side of good when she frees a Chinese journalist held captive in Spain. But betrayal lurks behind every code name. Kane realizes she is the target of assassins but who they are and why theyre aiming at her are the questions. Among the possibilities are Aaron (Channing Tatum) a former colleague; Paul (Michael Fassbender) with whom Kane is in a faux relationship; Kenneth (Ewan McGregor) her boss and ex-lover; and Ramon (Antonio Banderas) a sinister higher-level operative. Bill Paxton plays her father also an ex-Marine and almost as tough as his daughter. Double-crossing and triple-crossing abound and the audience like Kane is unsure if any of the main players are who they seem to be.The excitement pales in comparison to the best of the Bonds and any Bourne film but the stunts have a more realistic edge. Carano often nimbly eludes those on her tail. But when she falls she does it with a resounding thud making what came before seem more plausible. The thin story is less credible though it whizzes by swiftly. Though not among Soderberghs best -- those would be Out of Sight Traffic and King of the Hill -- Haywire and its fight scenes jangle the nerves and do it with panache.

Starring Gina Carano Ewan McGregor and Michael Fassbender. Directed by Steven Soderbergh. (R. 93 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) There are people who love movies and then there are people who love certain movies. And to sort one type of person from the other you might show them ""Haywire"" the latest from Steven Soderbergh. Put simply the people who love movies dont love them in spite of their vulgarity but because they are vulgar and obvious and manipulative and cheap and colossally and crazily effective. You dont love opera if you dont get a kick out of fat ladies singing ingenue roles and you dont love movies if the sight of Gina Carano beating up every guy in sight doesnt make you laugh get happy and feel as if youre getting your moneys worth. There are many good things to say about Soderbergh but here is the best thing the highest praise He is talented enough to be a snob but hes not. In between making art films and Major Motion Pictures he has lent his inspiration to pure-entertainment features and this latest is nothing more than a tangled revenge saga in which several powerful people make a mistake and get the wrong woman mad at them. Until this film I had never heard of Carano who was apparently a martial arts champion though that was yesterday. As of today shes a movie star. Beautiful in a girl-from-the-neighborhood sort of way Carano inhabits Soderberghs elaborate frame with wit physicality and just a hint of ironic distance the suggestion of someone whos not overawed by the opportunity or taking herself too seriously. It starts off quietly at a roadside diner and yet something in the first minutes of ""Haywire"" - it could be the soundtrack or the caged-animal edginess of Caranos movements or the way the camera looks around the place expecting trouble - tells you it wont be quiet for long. Yet even with that warning when the shift comes from low to high gear its a jolt and a delight too because with that you know the movie will not be confined by conventional limits. This is going to get a bit insane. Related Stories Haywire goes insane - in a good way In entertaining Haywire Gina Carano kicks some butt on her way to stardom Review Haywire ""Haywire"" takes place in a movie world of international intrigue with people zipping around the globe doing exciting awful things. Mallory (Carano) works for a private contracting company doing spy work providing protection rescuing hostages whatever is needed for whoever is paying. Ewan McGregor runs the company. Antonio Banderas is a nefarious mogul who sometimes employs the company. And Michael Douglas (looking reassuringly tan and healthy) plays a U.S. government operative who knows where all the bodies are buried - because he owns the shovel. Soderbergh elevates Carano in the audiences estimation by placing her in exalted company - Bill Paxton has a brief but strong role as her father as well. Then he makes use of the various locations and circumstances (Barcelona Dublin middle America) to showcase her in a wide range of contexts from the most rough to the most glamorous. Soderbergh sets out to make Carano into a star and he does it methodically like a carpenter making a table. A ""routine assignment"" with a British counterpart (Michael Fassbender) goes wildly wrong early in the film and that becomes the launching point for a film in which Carano is chased through several countries. Its one lively incident after another presented with imagination and audacity and yet with time taken for the movie and the viewer to breathe. Soderbergh knows what he is doing that he is working in a medium in which Charlie Chaplin kicking a guy in the pants is considered high art. Nothing is too low not when its done this well.

If you had a Schwarzenegger you crafted a film that required raw power little agility and (particularly early in his career) a bare minimum of speech. Have a Van Damme on your hands? Martial arts action lots of hand-to-hand combat and a little winking wit. Gymnastics champion Kurt Thomas is your star? Put him in white warm-up pants and have him pommel-horse the bad guys into submission. So when director Steven Soderbergh caught mixed martial arts fighter Gina Carano on TV by chance one night -- and saw in her the sort of charisma and physical talent of a great action hero -- the seed of Haywire was planted just like that. This is a film built around its star just as surely as any of its cheesier 80s forebears. Soderbergh who has a long history of working well with non-actors in his films took the fighter he saw on screen and along with screenwriter Lem Dobbs (who also penned Soderberghs Kafka and The Limey) created a celluloid persona that reflected what he saw in her already a tough self-assured and prodigiously talented physical performer. He just made her a mercenary doing black-ops work for the government rather than a cage fighter. The genesis story might be all 80s but Soderbergh reaches back further for the plot which feels more like a twisty contemplative 60s spy thriller than a pure action showcase. Caranos Mallory starts the film already on the run and the first half of the film reveals a globe-hopping knot of international intrigue that takes her from Barcelona to San Diego to Dublin -- first on a government job set up by her handler Kenneth (an impressively conniving Ewan McGregor) then on her own after a series of double-crosses leaves her ducking into shadows and scrambling across rooftops. The high-level motivations of that plot dont seem to interest Soderbergh much. As the puppetmasters (McGregor Michael Douglas Antonio Banderas) move the pieces (Michael Fassbender Mathieu Kassovitz Channing Tatum) into position they talk in cloaked language that feels vaguely authentic without really meaning much. But then understanding entirely whats happening isnt really necessary because much of that jargon-heavy complexity is really a decoy -- a device supporting the first-act notion that Haywire is a complicated machine in the mold of Oceans Eleven. (That films composer David Holmes heightens that perception with the same sort of jaunty jazzy lounge music that defined Oceans.) In reality itll turn out to be a deft single-minded revenge story that shares DNA with the thoughtful darkly funny The Limey. As with any great action movie what were really here to see is the star showing off whatever skills got them on screen to begin with. And Haywire never disappoints. Soderbergh makes two critical decisions in the action showcases of the film First he drops the music out entirely whenever a fight happens. Hes savvy enough to know that you dont need to manipulate the audiences emotions with music when you can just use the blunt-force impact of fists meeting faces and bodies crushing furniture. Secondly he doesnt cheat reality with close-ups and disorienting quick-cuts. He lets Carranos acrobatic talents play out in wide shots that are a less fantastical equivalent to the balletic beauty of Asian martial-arts movies. He gives each a unique tone and setting all leading up to a multiple-angle brilliantly edited masterpiece of a fight on a deserted beach that deserves to be enshrined in an action-movie hall of fame. Some might say that Soderbergh doesnt give Carano much to do but the fact is that he gives her only exactly what the movie needs a stone-faced magnetic physical presence with singular purpose and laserlike focus. Caranos got an all-star cast of talented actors around her to carry the dramatic load; that leaves her to perfectly execute the part that was created for her. To see what shes capable of here is to witness the birth of the next great action hero.

If she did shed probably strangle someone with it.As played by mixed-martial-arts fighter Gina Carano Mallory a black-ops contractor betrayed by her boss is the flurry of loose limbs and lethal intent atthe heart of Haywire. You might not want to mess with her.Thankfully for us her ill-advised antagonists have no such qualms. The ever-restless Steven Soderbergh shoots Caranos combat scenes in long wide shots the better to emphasize that she doesnt need a stunt double. Combine the dancelike fisticuffs with the ice-cool Soderbergh genre vibe including a jazzy score you might find on a particularly hip iPod and youve got a tasty handful of gourmet junk food.Carano a Dallas native and the daughter of former Cowboys backup quarterback Glenn Carano is no more an actress than Sasha Grey the porn star whom Soderbergh cast in 2009s Girlfriend Experience. Thats fine because shes not here to act. Her task is to snap crackle and pop the likes of Michael Fassbender Ewan McGregor and Channing Tatum all of them agents caught up in a plot that swings back and forth from past to present from Barcelona to Dublin to upstate New York.Haywire is the kind of chronological scramble that lights Soderberghs fire. (The screenwriter Lem Dobbs also penned the Soderbergh film The Limey; you can find plenty of story and structure similarities.) Something about the crime genre brings out Soderberghs frisky side; Haywire doesnt have the consequence of last years Contagion but it breathes in a way that movie never could.You could argue that Haywire isnt worthy of the man who made Traffic. You could also try to find a January action release with this kind of stylistic chutzpah. Just another day for a filmmaker who says he might retire soon. If and when he does the movies will get a lot less interesting.HAYWIREB+ Directed by Steven Soderbergh. Rated R (violence language). 93 mins.

"Haywire review Gina Carano kicks serious butt - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesHaywire review Gina Carano kicks serious buttCaranos Mallory is running a and kicking and punching a for her life in director Steven Soderberghs thriller.January 20 2012|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Michael Fassbender and Gina Carano stars in ""Haywire."" (Claudette Barius / Relativity...)Director Steven Soderberghs ""Haywire"" starring the marvelous mixed martial arts mastery of Gina Carano makes one thing perfectly clear Bad things happen in Barcelona. And if youre in the assassination and espionage game which Caranos Mallory Kane is you just might find yourself on the wrong end of a gun. Or in Mallorys case relentless kicks and flying fists. Less a tightly plotted action film than an excuse to showcase Caranos substantial fighting skills ""Haywire"" doesnt measure up to the best of the directors work a like say his Oscar-winning drug drama ""Traffic."" But watching Carano kick spin flip choke crack and crush the fiercest of foes a mostly men about twice her size a is thoroughly entertaining highly amusing and frankly somewhat awe-inspiring. Fortunately she doesnt bruise easily. The plot is indeed anchored to what went down in Barcelona. The narrative uses a ""Usual Suspects"" approach teasing the ending at the beginning then piecing the past together scene by scene. Sometimes the story unfolds in a set piece a like the all-important Barcelona gig that involved a high-stakes rescue and a romantic interlude or the trip to Dublin that brings Michael Fassbender into the picture as Paul Mallorys partner for a night of cocktails and killing. Other times it unfolds as she lays it out to the kid (Michael Angarano) whose car and whose company shes hijacked while trying to elude the bad guys. Mallory tells him that his job will be to explain what really happened. Maybe we could get his number. The film also stars Channing Tatum who like Fassbender is killer eye candy a as in lethal and good looking. His Aaron is the down-home charmer to Pauls tuxedoed Bond type. Kenneth a tightly shorn and slightly sleazy Ewan McGregor is the puppet-master pulling the strings at the contract-killing company where Mallory is suddenly on the outs. The major clients are Rodrigo (Antonio Banderas) and the governments Coblenz (Michael Douglas) also eye candy but of the aging gracefully sort; their loyalties more ambiguous. Motives are many but muddy a the important thing to remember is that Mallory must be eliminated. That single fact drives everything. Screenwriter Lem Dobbs has done better (the sci-fi mystery ""Dark City"") and worse (the Hollywood ride-along ""The Hard Way"") with ""Haywire"" somewhere in the middle a a few intriguing threads amid a bundle of loose ends. Its his most recent collaboration with Soderbergh echoing some of the get-the-bad-guy-at-all-costs themes of their better work ""Kafka"" and ""The Limey"" which basically bookended the 90s. But its not in the same league as the directors more accomplished films last years ""Contagion"" for example. The humor however is classic Soderbergh a dry bone dry 0% humidity dry. Mallorys plight is close to parody as the director plays with the espionage genre this time out (I cant wait till he gets around to horror). Unfortunately ""Haywire"" never quite gels into anything tense and this is theoretically a thriller. More in the vein of ""Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith"" but not as sexy or as clever it might have benefited from a little of the cerebral chill that so nicely infected ""Contagion"" and a dash more of the smart sardonic side the filmmaker brought to ""The Informant"" or the best of his ""Oceans Eleven"" series. The deficits are somewhat offset by the filmmakers sheer technical wizardry. Even Soderberghs worst work (and ""Haywire"" isnt that) cleans up nicely with such serious attention paid to lighting framing casting costumes colors sets; and per usual with the director handling the cinematography too under the name Peter Andrews. There is a sense within all the haywire high jinks that Carano might be able to do just fine with a role that didnt rest so heavily on fighting (though stunt coordinator R.A. Rondell proved a genius in choreographing all those tumbling rumbles). Her athleticism gives her movement a kind of force that translates powerfully on screen a people do seem inclined to get out of her way even when shes not angry. There are glimpses as well of an active interior life behind that flirty smile. But a fighting Mallory was her mission in ""Haywire"" and in that its hard to imagine that anyone could beat her. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESA familys Impossible journey of healingDecember 21 2012Essay Steven Soderberghs Haywire thinks as it fightsFebruary 5 2012Gina Carano took her fighting to a new level for HaywireJanuary 1 2012How Many Hits in This Lineup?May 6 2001SNEAKS 91  A USERS GUIDE TO SNEAKS 91  This special...January 20 1991MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesEntertainmentBarcelonaEwan McgregorCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/reviews/la-et-haywire-20120120,0,5340744.story?track=rss",200,haywire15,haywire,latimes

Mallory Kane (Gina Carano) the covert operative at the center of Steven Soderberghs ""Haywire is a heartbreaker. If your heart belongs to one of the movies male stars - Michael Douglas Antonio Banderas Michael Fassbender Ewan McGregor Channing Tatum - the haste with which some of them are dispatched will cause it to break. Carano is an unconventional choice to build a movie around but Soderbergh has always been as attracted to recessive personalities (like his own) as he has been to dominant ones.Carano is a professional kick-boxer and mixed-martial artist and once was a warrior on ""American Gladiators. Her round kind face splits the difference between Linda Fiorentino and Britney Spears but it doesnt hold the screen. The face might not do much but her body can do anything. Theres nothing recessive about that. And the pleasure of this small eccentric movie is the natural way Carano hurts people - by say walking partway up a wall and climbing onto a mans back by sprinting toward the camera and flying into the human target standing in the foreground.Soderbergh has put microphones on all the actors so that when they throw each other around what you hear is mostly live sound. The muffled crunch it produces is not unlike the sound of looking for loose change between the cushions of a leather sofa. The tussles lack the crispness snap and pow of what we ordinarily hear when two people punch each other in the face or when a head collides with the metal brace around a barstool. That adjustment as well as making Carano the focal point amounts to a brilliant change in priorities for a movie we have otherwise seen before.Indeed Soderberghs colors dont pop the way they normally do and David Holmess electronic score operates at a jazzy TV-detective-show simmer (there are entire chases and fights when it doesnt operate at all). Mallory has been double-crossed and spends the movie piecing together how and why. What keeps her interesting as a character is that shes not a killing machine. We learn that instead shes an ex-Marine. So her agility and sense of privacy make real sense. Lem Dobbss script uses flashbacks to explain how Mallory changed from a contractor in Barcelona and Dublin to a fugitive in the American Southwest.Mallory is classified by her employer (McGregor) as an ""essential element to anyone seeking his companys services. When she teams up with other operatives - Tatum once then Fassbender - ""Haywire also toys with the idea of the romantic caper. Movies like ""Charade ""North by Northwest and ""To Catch a Thief are boiled down beyond their essential elements until all thats left is a woman a man and their physicality. This is one of the few movies I can think of in which two characters saying nothing to each other constitutes a form of wit.Were used to thinking about how movie violence feels like a substitute for sex. This is one of the closest approximations of that conflation. The body-to-body combat is tight and close. Its intimate. The rustling and grunting your hear is the same as when two people paw at each other out of lust. Mallorys goal it seems in most fights is to get as close as she can to her opponent and find the bodily breaking point. She pulls one poor fellow toward her on a bed with her legs and squeezes until he passes out. Right now the only woman at the movies more intimidating is the one with the dragon tattoo.Otherwise this is about as close as commercial moviemaking gets to Jean-Luc Godards prerogative of tampering with an audiences expectations of both a genre and a director of denying us conventional pleasure. Here the thriller is empty of thrills. There are no frills in Caranos face. The experiment of ""Haywire is to approximate how an action movie might proceed along lifes hallways and rooftops and inside its hotel suites. In that sense Soderbergh hasnt made an action movie at all. Hes made a documentary.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2012 Globe Newspaper Company.

A black ops super agent seeks payback after she is betrayed and set up during a mission. Video courtesy Relativity Media. By Joe Morgenstern January 20 2012 In a movie thats basically about watching a formidable female run kick and punch her way through a world of treacherous males one of the best exchanges comes when her betrayer orders a dapper assassin to terminate her. ""Ive never done a woman before"" the designated killer says to which the other guy replies ""You shouldnt think of her as being a woman."" Good advice given her awesome prowess but how should we think of Mallory Kane the special-ops agent played by Gina Carano a mixed martial-arts virtuoso making her feature debut? As a fighting machine one that registers ambient danger with all the efficiency of The Terminator and the light irony of James Bond but also as a beautifully seductive construction at the center of a film that is itself an elegant machine. Theres no deeper meaning to Steven Soderberghs thriller than what meets the eye yet its lustrous surfaces offer great and guilt-free pleasure. ENLARGE Gina Carano and Ewan McGregor in Haywire. Relativity Media The story starts in upstate New York then moves to Barcelona Dublin New Mexico and Washington. The plot--basically betrayal followed by payback--pits Mallory against the unprincipled security contractor shes been working for plus all of his shadowy minions. The action isnt nonstop no matter what the trailer makes you think. Some of the most satisfying stretches come when something is about to happen as in a very long and ominous tracking shot that follows Mallory down a Dublin sidewalk across the street from St. Stephens Green. (Mr. Soderbergh directing from a script by Lem Dobbs did his own cinematography which is richly understated when the colors arent morphing into interludes of grainy black-and-white or baleful ocher.) When something does happen its usually a violent confrontation between Mallory and her baselessly confident adversaries. In at least two instances she visits unusual pain and suffering on their genitals but thats far from the only page in her playbook of righteous mayhem. Most of her moves are the ones Ms. Carano deploys in the relatively new arena of womens mixed martial arts except that here in the arena of mainstream action thrillers the newly minted movie star must do more than dabble in the dramatic arts. So how does she do? Really well all things considered meaning that most movie performances are constructed from discrete pieces and this one is no exception; that her sultry voice may be a discreetly enhanced version of the one she uses in real life and that her character by the nature of the special-ops trade finds her finest expression in exuberant physicality. It remains to be seen whether Ms. Caranos star presence will take her beyond action roles but shes certainly appealing in this one and very much at home in a strong cast that includes Michael Fassbender Ewan McGregor Michael Douglas Antonio Banderas Channing Tatum Bill Paxton and Michael Angarano. Keep an eye out too for a deer but not in anyones headlights. Miss Bala Watch a clip of ""Miss Bala"" a story of a young woman clinging on to her dream to become a beauty contest queen in a Mexico dominated by organized crime. Video courtesy of Fox. No beauty contest has ever been more bizarre than the one in Gerardo Naranjos shockingly powerful thriller in Spanish with English subtitles. The tearful winner Laura (Stephanie Sigman) a 23-year-old innocent from Tijuana is crowned Miss Baja even though sheer terror has kept her from saying a single word to the audience or smiling a genuine smile. The source of her paralysis isnt stage fright but fear for her life. Through no fault of her own Laura has fallen into the clutches of a Baja California narco gang that engineered her hollow triumph. (The ironic title means ""Miss Bullet."") Mr. Naranjo a gifted filmmaker who wrote the film with Mauricio Katz never insists on symbols--theres too much action and suspense for that--but its irresistible to see his heroine as a stand-in for her beautiful country increasingly a hostage to savage crime. ENLARGE Stephanie Sigman in Miss Bala. 2oth Century Fox This is a remarkable film with a strong performance in the title role. Ms. Sigman whose beauty would shine in any contest is only a couple of years older than the character she plays and her professional experience is limited; she came to acting by way of modeling. Still she energizes every scene shes in i.e. every scene in the movie which never for a moment loses track of her or fails to show the action from Lauras point of view. And the action as designed by Mr. Naranjo and his cinematographer Matyas Erdely has a disjunct quality that borders on the surreal. Street battles break out without warning setting thugs armed to the teeth against cops coming on like special-forces commandos. During lulls in the action the Estrella gangs trucks and SUVs course through city streets in motorcades that avoid police checkpoints with the help of spotters on cellphones. Its impossible for Laura to know whats happening around her whats going to happen next or whos on which side. In fact she wouldnt have been forced into doing the gangs bidding if she hadnt enlisted the help of a crooked cop. ""Miss Bala"" is a portrait of a young woman who is at once terribly vulnerable and improbably brave. Its equally a vision of a vulnerable society on the road to anarchy. Coriolanus In taking on one of Shakespeares more opaque plays for his directorial debut Ralph Fiennes emulates the hero he portrays a refractory Roman general Caius Martius ""Coriolanus"" for whom compromise equals surrender. But Martius comes to a bad end while Mr. Fiennes achieves a great beginning. As a director his grasp exceeds his daring reach and his performance stands as a chilling exemplar of psychomartial ferocity. The setting is contemporary give or take a decade. Ancient Rome has become a modern city where hungry citizens rioting for grain are dispersed by troops wielding automatic weapons and where TV news shows broadcast frequent updates of the Roman armys bloody campaign against its Volscian enemies--if it bleeds it leads indeed. But Shakespeares English is still spoken with a clarity that results from the pace that Mr. Fiennes has set for himself and his fellow actors--deliberate sometimes to the point of verbal slo-mo yet so charged with feeling as to sound like conversation that only happens to flow forth in iambic pentameter. The modern dress works well. What might have been a stunt emphasizes the military aspects of the play--those automatic weapons dont exclude mano a mano combat with knives--and intensifies the domestic drama that might have seemed more remote had it been cloaked in gowns and togas. Thats not to suggest that the film is instantly accessible. It takes a while assuming a willingness to invest the effort before you can tune into the marvelous language then get beyond it to concentrate on revelations of character. But riches of character are revealed with copious visual invention. (The cinematographer Barry Ackroyd who shot last weeks thriller ""Contraband"" fills ""Coriolanus"" with startling images.) Mr. Fienness Martius head shaven and covered with blood becomes a cautionary character a rigid soldier ill-suited to civic affairs. Martius takes pleasure in his towering vanity refuses to conceal his scorn for the common people hates his enemies with a naked passion that inspires awe. The cast includes Vanessa Redgrave as the heros mother Volumnia alongside whom todays tiger moms seem toothless; Jessica Chastain as his ardent wife Virgilia; Gerard Butler as Tullus Aufidius his mortal enemy and Brian Cox as the accommodating senator Menenius. They are superb every one of them. Red Tails Watch a clip of Cuba Gooding Jr.s latest film ""Red Tails"". A crew of African American pilots in the Tuskegee training program having faced segregation while kept mostly on the ground during World War II are called into duty under the guidance of Col. A.J. Bullard. No story from World War II is more deserving of a great movie than that of the Tuskegee Airmen. A squadron of Negro fighter pilots they struggled against white prejudice for a chance to prove themselves in combat and succeeded brilliantly winning nearly 100 Distinguished Flying Crosses. Then they returned to civilian life in a nation still gripped by Jim Crow. Few stories have followed a longer path to the big screen than ""Red Tails"" which was ignored by the studios for decades until according to its producer George Lucas he decided to make it with his own money. The end result is not a great movie but a deeply misconceived one that tells the story with a comic-book sensibility--""Die you foolish African"" snarls a Messerschmitt pilot--and a videogame approach to the visual effects. (Anthony Hemingway directed broadly from a truly foolish script by John Ridley and Aaron McGruder. Terrence Howard and Cuba Gooding Jr. head the cast.) One could argue that the target audience--black teenagers Mr. Lucas has said--might be most receptive to a film that conveys history through contemporary entertainment. But this isnt contemporary entertainment its antiquated kitsch reprocessed by the producers nostalgia for the movies of his boyhood. The story has been stripped of historical context--dont black teenagers and everyone else deserve hard facts?--and internal logic. (How for example are the initially demoralized and undisciplined members of the squadron able to best the Luftwaffe in early encounters?) Whats left is a collection of war-movie cliches; a wartime Italian setting that looks weirdly idyllic if not quite prosperous; sappy interludes of romance between one of the fliers and a pretty village girl; a hapless borrowing from ""Stalag 17"" and computer-generated aerial sequences that in their whiz-bang wondrousness have lost every connection with authenticity. DVD Focus ENLARGE The Limey (1999) Steven Soderbergh directed and Lem Dobbs wrote this slyly funny spasmodically violent film noir in which the title character a white-haired obsessive named Wilson (Terence Stamp) shows up in Los Angeles to avenge his daughters death. Like Elliott Goulds Philip Marlowe in ""The Long Goodbye"" Wilson cant comprehend the glittering new culture that surrounds him mistaking valet car-parkers for uniformed troops in a gangsters private army. I couldnt comprehend how the star was able to look as young as he did in flashbacks of Wilson in his twenties. See the film first then search online for the secret. Richard III (1995) This rousing version directed by Richard Loncraine relocates the play to a fictional fascist England of the mid-1930s that suggests some surreal convergence of Sir Oswald Mosleys blackshirts with the sumptuous decadence of Bernardo Bertoluccis ""The Conformist."" Ian McKellen makes Richards malignity sexy. His voice may not be as oaken as Richard Burtons was or as burnished as John Gielguds but its a beautifully modulated instrument with its own somber music. His long face punctuated by a pencil mustache is a place of jowls creases and inflammation. Also with Maggie Smith Nigel Hawthorne Kristin Scott Thomas and Robert Downey Jr. Battle of Britain (1969) As historical drama its imperfect but watch the phenomenal aerial sequences and youll see whats missing from the digital effects in ""Red Tails."" This production under the direction of Guy Hamilton pulled together a veritable international air force of authentic airplanes in flying condition--British Spitfires and Hurricanes versus German Messerschmitt 109s Heinkel 111s and Junkers 52s. The cast is fairly dazzling too--Michael Caine Trevor Howard Laurence Olivier Christopher Plummer Harry Andrews Curt Jurgens Michael Redgrave Ralph Richardson Robert Shaw Kenneth More and Susannah York to name just a notable few.

OK well buy that we think (but gee she sure looks skinny). Slideshow Fun new spy heroine is the real deal Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon More about Haywire >> When Gina Carano starts running through the streets in her big-screen action debut chasing or being chased around Barcelona or Dublin in Haywire theres not a second when we wonder really? And when the mixed martial arts champ-turned-movie star (heres hoping) knocks Michael Fassbender silly in a hotel room - drop-kicking him through a doorway scissor-locking his head - theres absolutely no doubt. This woman is serious. And Haywire the globe-hopping spy vehicle Steven Soderbergh has built around his charismatic new leading lady is from start to finish serious fun. Disarmingly laid back for this kind of fare with a jazzy musical score (courtesy of David Holmes) and a sleek straight-ahead style Haywire may not make much sense plotwise but its a rollicking 90 minutes of double-crosses and triple-crosses assignations and assassinations close-quarters combat and cool espionage-speak. Carano is Mallory Kane a freelance hit woman trained by the CIA who takes a job to ""extract"" a Chinese dissident being held hostage in Spain. But before we get to that Mallory has dropped down into snowy New England. She looks a little dazed perhaps or at least out of breath. She wanders into a roadside diner sits at a booth collects her thoughts. A guy (Channing Tatum) walks in and takes the seat across the table. He orders coffee. They seem to be friends. (Didnt Martha Marcy May Marlene open exactly the same way?) Next thing you know hes waving a gun and then all heck breaks loose. The diner has become a cage-match venue feet and fists flying. Then Mallory is on the run collaring a wide-eyed rube named Scott (Michael Angarano) and using his car to make her getaway. He wants to know what that was all about and for the sake of flashbacking to Barcelona for the first half of the movie she obliges. Soderbergh who introduced another formidable female gunslinger - Jennifer Lopezs Karen Cisco - in his 1998 adaptation of Elmore Leonards Out of Sight rings Carano with a cast of cool dudes. In addition to Fassbender a suave fellow freelancer and Tatum who plays Mallorys partner on the Barcelona job Ewan McGregor shows up as a shiftless killer; Michael Douglas looking fit and G-man-ish is a shadow-ops bigwig and Antonio Banderas bearded and then not is a jet-setting baddy. Bill Paxton camped out in a Frank Lloyd Wright-ish New Mexico abode plays Mallorys Marine Corps veteran dad. Their reunion is touching - until the guys with Uzis storm in. Haywire isnt deep and Caranos line-readings could use honing but she has presence and grace and grace under pressure. And when she jumps across the rooftops of Dublin thats really her doing the jumping. Shes not kidding around. Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Shari L. Gross Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Mixed-martial-arts champ Gina Carano isnt the first fighting star to attempt a transition to a movie career a crossover that sometimes works (Dwayne Johnson) but mostly doesnt (Jesse Ventura Chuck Norris et al.). But with the guidance of the endlessly experimental Steven Soderbergh Carano makes quite a credible transition in ""Haywire."" She plays Mallory Kane a tough-as-nails black-ops agent who takes matters into her own hands following a double-cross. The part isnt a stretch for the top-ranked MMA star but her casting is more than a stunt. With her watch-your-step demeanor and smoky gaze Carano has real presence. The movie is packed with resourceful actors (Michael Douglas as a shadowy CIA type Michael Fassbender as a suave MI6 agent Ewan McGregor as a conniving security contractor) so she doesnt have to carry every scene. While she cant out-act Angelina Jolie Carano definitely looks comfortable onscreen. And shes a lot more credible kicking butt. In ""Haywire"" she has a vehicle nicely suited to her specialized but nevertheless real talents. The fight scenes are everything in a movie like this and they are staged with the tough bone-crunching physicality that John McTiernan brought to ""Die Hard."" The actors do their own stunts mostly in long shots and nothing happens that is physically impossible. Doing his own cinematography under his cameraman alias Peter Andrews Soderbergh puts us right in the thick of the action. David Holmes jazz-combo score whose bass registers stress the tension of anxious scenes drops away so we can hear every grunt thud and scuffle. I counted at least seven ""Whoa I cant believe I just saw that"" moments during Caranos room-wrecking hand-to-hand battle with Fassbender. Among them was a first a coffee table that did not fall to splinters when a body crashed into it. Nice touch. With screenwriter Lem Dobbs (his collaborator on the superb revenge flick ""The Limey"") Soderbergh offers a teasing clever take on violent B movies made for 19-year-olds. Its artisan trash delivering the action-thriller goods but on its own intelligent terms. Theres a lot to watch and even a bit to contemplate; the slippery time-skipping chronology requires a bit of cognitive effort then repays it in full. Claudette Barius / AP Relativity Media Gina Carano and Ewan McGregor in ""Haywire."" The characters are richer and situated in relationships closer to real life than simplistic movie scenes. And the conventions of the genre -- spoon-feeding exposition to the audience fancy getaway driving -- are given their due and roundly spoofed at the same time. Capable people worked on this and did not squander their talent. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

By Richard Corliss Jan. 19 2012 Share Read Later Claudette Barius / Relativity Media / APMichael Fassbender left and Gina Carano Haywire Year 2011 Director Steven Soderbergh Studio Relativity Actors Gina Carano Ewan McGregor Channing Tatum Antonio Banderas Michael Douglas Michael Fassbender RelatedReview Carano kicks butt in `Haywire film debut Associated PressHaywire Technical Advisor Aaron Cohen on Creating Gun Jitsu Wall Street Journal Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture Gina ""Conviction"" Carano has spent plenty of time before the camera. This brunette Muay Thai warrior queen was Crush on American Gladiator and on Showtime the heartthrob of womens Mixed Martial Arts--a combination of boxing and wrestling plus the kicking hair-pulling and eye-gouging of a brawl in a convent schoolyard. Caranos one defeat to jujitsu blond Cris ""Cyborg"" Santos provided five minutes of electrifying brutality. Outside the ring she boasts fluent conversational skills and a lighthouse smile. So theres no reason she couldnt make it big in movies. Jeez Steven Seagal did. Another Steven Soderbergh had just the launch pad for Carano a studiously generic action project called Haywire that would serve as a parade ground for her fighting skills by casting her as Mallory Kane a U.S. government contract whos betrayed and sucker-punched by nearly every operative shes worked with. Pairing Mallory with one male antagonist after another and throwing them both into spaces as cramped as a MMA cage--a rural diner a hallway a hotel room--the director gets Carano to simulate her professional strength stamina and pugilistic ingenuity. Its James Bond vs. Rosa Klebb in the From Russia With Love train compartment only youre rooting for Rosa. For those who yearn to see a woman beat the crap out of Channing Tatum or best Michael Fassbender in a bedroom or leave Ewan McGregor whimpering this is your movie. (MORE See TIMEs review of Michael Fassbender in Shame) In golden-age Hollywood the main character in a womans picture was someone with the skills to bend a mans emotions to hers. These days a movie woman proves her femininity by having the biggest cojones around. In the script by Lem Dobbs (the pseudonym borrowed from Humphrey Bogarts character in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre taken by writer Anton Kitaj the son of painter R.B. Kitaj) Mallory gets to prove her testicular fortitude in the first few minutes. Sitting in an upstate New York diner she is briefly wooed then savagely punched by her old partner Aaron (Tatum); in a few minutes hes breakfast hash. Sent to Barcelona to free a political prisoner and to Dublin as the ""eye candy"" escort to freelance spy Paul (Fassbender) Mallory finds shes been set up for her own demise. Everywhere she encounters unreliable dudes Michael Douglas as a CIA biggie Antonio Banderas as some bearded malefactor. The only man she can trust is her father (Bill Paxton) the author of Shooter-style novels and like Mallory an ex-Marine. Dad should have turned out to be the ultimate villain--since spy-movie plots no less than space operas often climax with the revelation and dispatch of the evil father figure--but Haywire doesnt bother to go there. (MORE See Corliss take on Soderberghs Che) The screenplay doesnt bother detonating any surprises at all; narrative ingenuity is sooo 1940s. After the diner donnybrook Mallory more or less kidnaps a young guy Scott (Michael Angorano from Gentlemen Broncos) who serves no plot function but to listen to her flashbacks of the past week; his character is then jettisoned and forgotten. The film also pays little heed to plausibility. Mallorys first fight is ignored by the other diners who are ignored by the camera. Later she engages in a long loud battle in a hotel room whose immediate neighbors dont instantly summon the staff. Of course the mayhem isnt taking place in a diner or a swank suite; its occurring in an alternate movie universe whose capital is Soderburg and where reality never registers a complaint or knocks on the door as the practitioners of the hard arts ply their noisy job. Only in Soderburg would the climactic showdown involving Mallory and her final betrayer be derailed because the unfortunate dastard has got his foot caught in a cleft of beach rocks as if the movie had suddenly U-turned into a seaside 127 Hours. Well let someone decide whether this scenario construction is lazy or post-modernist hip. Dobbs and Soderbergh may figure that their audience is here for the fights and not for the coherence so they may as well goof the system. As sleazy businessman Mathieu Kassovitz tells Mallory while inviting her to wander through a labyrinthine garden ""The whole point is to relax and lose yourself."" (MORE See TIMEs review of Soderberghs Contagion) In the two-dozen features hes directed since sex lies and videotape in 1989 Soderbergh has become full-service auteur cranking out a movie or two a year and serving pseudonymously as his own cinematographer and editor. Hes also been one of the most committed commuters between glossy Hollywood filmmaking (the Oceans franchise) and no-budget indies (Bubble) not to mention virtually every substratum within the broad spectrum of narrative movies. On one side Traffic Erin Brockovich and Contagion; on the other Kafka Schizopolis The Girlfriend Experience and his Spanish-language Che bio-pic; and in the middle the smartly weird comedies Full Frontal and The Informant Even for Soderbergh Haywire is a twist a formula caper pic with an indie vibe. The movie cites dozens of old- and recent-Hollywood tropes like the hot-coffee-in-the-face scene from The Big Heat and Matt Damons punchup in a Tangiers bathroom from The Bourne Ultimatum but it also has affectless stretches with moody glances and not much happening familiar from so many off-Hollywood films. In that rural upstate New York dinner an art-house regular may expect to see the religious cultists from Higher Ground and Marcy Martha May Marlene in the next stall. Half the time David Holmess brazenly derivative score is pumping out the wocka-wocka guitar echoes of 70s B movies and countless porn videos; but theres no music in the fight scenes just the percussion of fist on face and in some of the tenser moments Soderbergh uses silence cleverly as if he were conducting the first movement of John Cages ""433."" (MORE See TIMEs Top 10 Best Movies of 2011) The fights are fine though not as punishing as the Carano-Santos match or as crazy-great as the martial mayhem Tony Jaa endured and dished out in the immortal Thai cruncher Ong-Bak back in 04. We liked it when Carano cracks Tatums head against the steel rim of a bar stool and the collision makes a crisp ding sound as if to signal the round over. But whats missing oddly is the ferocious radiance and ease before the camera that any Carano fan can find at a YouTube touch. Sure this is an action movie and the new actress neednt tear a passion to tatters. Nor can she be expected to show the character nuances of other strong ladies in peril--Uma Thurman in Kill Bill Angelina Jolie in Salt--since she has precious little character to play. But Carano seems reluctant to be photographed in repose; her personality is as undercover as Mallory is. Soderbergh must have realized hed demanded more of his first-time leading lady than he could get from her. In Caranos big emoting moment when she hugs her dad in front of his living-room fireplace the director does all the acting for her blacking her face in charcoal camouflage and lighting it with the flicker of the heart flames. Carano is her own best stuntwoman but in the dialogue scenes shes all kick and no charisma. The MMA battler lacks the conviction she so forcefully displayed in the ring. She is not Haywires heroine but its hostage.

(Claudette Barius) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated Thursday January 19 2012 1200 PM Title Haywire Film Info Director Steven Soderbergh (133). R violence language. At area theaters. Early in ""Haywire"" a government operative played by Michael Douglas says the black ops agent Mallory Tate is ""value added"" for an assignment. The same could be true of the woman who plays her Mixed Martial Arts champ Gina Carano and what she brings to this action drama. Director Steven Soderbergh wisely uses Carano in her acting debut as the metronome that sets the movies pace. Carano is cool and in control even after running in real time several blocks and pummeling a guy in an alley. But ""Haywire"" clean and no-fuss as it is needs more action scenes to match Caranos game. Her character Mallory Kane is a crucial cog in a shadowy private-sector agency run by a nerdy mole named Kenneth (Ewan McGregor). A job rescuing a kidnapped dissident in Barcelona goes wrong as Mallory tells a kid (Michael Angarano) whose car shes just stolen. In flashback we see how all that relates to a setup in Dublin and a suspicious client (Michael Fassbender) and why Mallory is high-tailing it to her military-fiction writer dad (Bill Paxton) and his Santa Fe home. Mallorys connection to Kenneth and a fellow agent (Channing Tatum) - a kid whose naivete is the opposite of Mallorys worldliness - is gone and slinking around the edges are curious international characters (Antonio Banderas Matthieu Kassovitz) who need cover for their double-crosses. ""Haywire"" has some graceful touches like a fight on a beach that allows for no place to hide. Soderbergh avoids any music during the action scenes a smart disquieting choice that shows how upper-tier directors when they do genre flicks (a la Quentin Tarantino Sam Raimi and Michael Mann) can elevate things instead of letting conventions drag them down. But while theres a sense of discovery to Carano that if not quite comparable to Bruce Lee in ""Fists of Fury"" is certainly similar to Jason Statham in ""Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels."" Soderbergh uses her physicality as a secret weapon he never fully unloads. Carano is known for Muay Thai boxing and her wiry style can be balletic and brutal at the same time. Yet as much fun as it is to see her pummel McGregor and Fassbender (instead of throwaway stunt goons) ""Haywire"" keeps her in check. Perhaps Soderbergh wanted Lem Dobbs somewhat laborious script to draw us in or maybe the prolific filmmaker didnt want to oversell his stars natural talent. He neednt have worried With a passing resemblance to Carla Gugino (quick someone cast them as kick-ass sisters) and an ability to hold her own whether in a cocktail dress or choking her bigger-paycheck co-stars Carano leaves us wanting more. Maybe thats the point. Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"Haywire review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Haywire Heroine Gina Carano can kick it and hard a 3 starsJanuary 19 2012|Michael Phillips | Movie criticGina Carano stars in ""Haywire.""In terms of its title""Haywire""doesnt quite go there; its more ""Haywire-ish."" But its eccentric and the on-screen violence is sharp and exciting -- brutal without being either subhumanly sadistic or superhumanly ridiculous.Director Steven Soderbergh had an idea to showcase the serious muscly agility of Womens Mixed Martial Arts star Gina Carano without a lot of digital this or stunt-double that. Early in the picture special operative Mallory Kane played by Carano is being set up for a double cross and suspects as much. She meets her colleague played by Channing Tatum in a roadside diner. Soderbergh noses in close to Caranos face. Theres not much dialogue just a few cryptic lines about their duplicitous boss and missions undertaken in Barcelona and Dublin.Then just when were getting frustrated with the inside baseball Carano bites her lower lip in such a way as to explain why on YouTube you can find a clip titled ""Gina Carano Lip Bite -- Hot"" And then Tatum socks her in the head hard. Two minutes later after some crisply but simply staged viciousness (kicks punches -- you can see why Soderbergh has said he wanted to work with Carano because ""she can break people in half"") Mallory runs out of the diner with a hostage and Tatums character stays behind in a heap.If Lem Dobbs script were a little snappier or a little less zigzaggy ""Haywire"" would be a first-rate B-picture instead of an interesting one. But even with its limited narrative payoff the films appeal remains blunt and consistent. Carano (whose voice was altered -- lowered to a menacing purr -- in post-production) takes care of business with Tatum and then with Michael Fassbender (who plays another operative) and then Ewan McGregor as Mallorys ex and overseer. She beats the hell out of everybody. Carano may not be a born or a natural actress; she is however an undeniable and heartening rebuke to the skinny-Minnies Hollywood favors over real women with curves.Michael Douglas and Antonio Banderas offer neat little portraits in untrustworthy authority even though with a gun to my head I couldnt relay to you who was doing what to whom and to what end. How does the plot tie everyone together? Not very elegantly Unfolding mostly as an extended illustrated flashback while Mallory and her hostage (Michael Angarano) drive drive drive ""Haywire"" shows what happens when dumb venal men (government security contractors and various killers) underestimate smart vicious women who do not like to be framed for murder.Soderbergh may be making a globe-trotting revenge thriller but hes a genial subversive by temperament and part of Soderberghs impulse involves undercutting and redirecting audience expectations. Shot as usual by Soderbergh himself using lightweight efficiency-plus digital equipment ""Haywire"" may lack in story terms what its star so obviously can throw anytime a punch. Yet Soderbergh ever the scamp manages to spice up a routine vehicular chase sequence (in the snow in the woods) with the funniest sight gag of the year involving ... well you wont see it coming and you wont hear anymore about it from me. And when Carano gets slammed into a good-sized flat-screen TV because it looks real-ish and its photographed in a single medium shot you actually feel sorry for the TV.mjphillipstribune.comHaywire -- 3 starsMPAA rating R (for some violence)Running time 145.Opens Friday MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesPink Gets Praise at Thanks for Sharing PremiereSeptember 17 2013Magic Mike director Steven Soderbergh working now not...June 27 2012Channing Tatum is figuring it all out with Jonah Hill on...March 15 2012Magic Mike Its a living for Steven Soderberghs troupe...June 28 2012Oscar Producers Unveil 47 Presenters for Sunday ShowFebruary 24 2014Find More Stories AboutEwan McgregorMichael FassbenderChanning TatumTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0117-haywire-20120119,0,4040229.column",200,haywire23,haywire,chicagotribune

Share Tweet Like any Steven Soderbergh film Haywire comes with a level of sophistication--an achronological structure a multi-toned color palette a knotty tale of alliances and double-crosses--but in this case its all an elaborate smokescreen. In truth Haywire is simply a delivery system for ass-kickings calibrated to the specific talents of Gina Carano a former mixed-martial-arts star and American Gladiator whose fists (and feet) of fury can rattle skulls and cave in chests. Screenwriter Lem Dobbs who worked with Soderbergh on Kafka and The Limey has streamlined the latter into a more basic revenge tale--with elements of an international spy thriller--thats written within Caranos range and hits action beats with satisfying regularity. Its his and Soderberghs idea of lizard-brain entertainment and its pleasures are remarkably distilled. After years of buying the thin fantasy that wired-up celebrities like Cameron Diaz can tear up a room the opening scene alone is a bracing tonic as Carano and Channing Tatum lay waste to a diner in upstate New York. As revealed via flashback Tatum is one of Caranos ex-partners in the special-ops business and shes been marked for death since they joined forces to rescue a dissident Chinese journalist in Barcelona. Carano doesnt know precisely whos responsible for her betrayal which involves a complicated ring of private and government contracts but a few bosses or clients emerge as suspects played by recognizable faces like Michael Douglas Ewan McGregor and Antonio Banderas. Michael Fassbender also turns up as an agent who tries to take her out in a four-star hotel room in Dublin. Though strikingly beautiful and charismatic Carano isnt a conventional movie star She has an athletes compact frame and looks far more eager when shes putting it to use than when shes trading lines with a battery of famous actors. Happily Soderbergh and Dobbs have given her a role of Man With No Name terseness and allowed her to negotiate this world of powerful men by squeezing their necks in a scissor-lock. In spite of the pulsing David Holmes score at his disposal Soderbergh drops all but the raw sound of pummeling from the fights a masterstroke that Caranos dexterity makes possible. She may have Cynthia Rothrocks career in front of her but for now shes a new model of action star.

A straight-up action picture may sound unusual coming from Steven Soderbergh but as hes repeatedly demonstrated throughout his career hes keen to experiment with every genre imaginable. And if you look closely at his latest ""Haywire"" youll find it reveals glimmers of some of his greatest hits.Its a revenge thriller like ""The Limey"" (and comes from the same screenwriter Lem Dobbs). It features a color-coded palette scheme to correspond with each new location in this globe-trotting tale like ""Traffic."" It has a `70s-style aesthetic sensibility reminiscent of ""The Informant"" It boasts an all-star cast like Soderberghs ""Oceans"" movies ""Full Frontal"" and most recently ""Contagion."" But at its center is an actress whod never appeared in a major feature film before like ""The Girlfriend Experience"" and ""Bubble.""So since were in the midst of making comparisons well just say that ""Haywire"" feels like minor Soderbergh zippy hugely entertaining and well-crafted as always (since he once again serves as his own cinematographer and editor) but not one of his more important films in the broad scheme of things.It does however mark the auspicious film debut of MMA superstar Gina Carano as special-ops bad-ass Mallory Kane. Carano had never acted before and not only did she do all her own stunts she had to do them in a way that she wouldnt injure her male co-stars including Ewan McGregor Michael Fassbender and Channing Tatum. Her dialogue delivery may seem a bit stiff -- and she has acknowledged that Soderbergh made some tweaks to her voice in post-production -- but she has tremendous presence an intriguing mix of muscular power and eye-catching femininity.Mallory works for a private contractor that performs secret missions for the U.S. government. Her latest required her and her team to rescue a Chinese journalist whod been kidnapped and was being held captive in Barcelona. The mission itself (pretty much) went down as planned but afterward she finds shes been set up. Now her task is to figure out whos double-crossed her and why.All of this takes place out of chronological order as it hops around between upstate New York Barcelona Washington Dublin the scrub-brushed buttes of New Mexico and a Mexican beach at sunset. (That last location is one of the most beautiful with the warm jagged rocks serving as a striking backdrop for one of the films most intense fights.) Mallory tells her story to the poor schmo whose car she has to borrow (played by Michael Angarano) for escape; its intentionally disorienting but thats part of the fun.Among the excellent cast McGregor plays Mallorys obviously slimy boss with whom she shares some sort of nebulous romantic history. Tatum is her partner on the Barcelona job who may or may not be trustworthy. Fassbender is the British agent with whom shes asked to team up on a follow-up mission; their scenes smolder with an old-school James Bond sense of glamour and intrigue as well as danger. Michael Douglas plays Mallorys government contact and the one person she seems to be able to trust aside from her father (Bill Paxton) who like her is a former Marine. And Antonio Banderas is her Spanish connection a role he plays in almost as cartoonish a fashion as his ""Puss in Boots"" character.Regardless of the setting the opponent or their motives Soderbergh is smart enough to emphasize Caranos strengths. He lets the elaborate fight scenes play out -- lets us see every kick punch and body slam -- without a lot of needless edits and even without any music. The battles provide their own rhythm and afterward you may feel as if youve been worked over as well. But in a good way.""Haywire"" a Relativity Media release is rated R for some violence.

The brutality is sickening intensified by the shock of seeing a man whale on a woman with an ugliness that in the grammar of movies is traditionally reserved for men on men with the expectation of a fair fight. As it happens the lady -- a covert-ops specialist with the pulp-fiction name of Mallory Kane -- can take care of herself. Played by mixed-martial-arts champion Gina Carano Mallory punches kicks and stomps back handily beating the bejayzus out of her adversary and former spy-world colleague (Channing Tatum). Finally she breaks his arm wrestles away his gun and drives off toward her next fight. This gender-flipped combat is meant to please the moviegoer. But I call foul The agreement to laugh off the realistic-yet-bloodless beating of a woman as cartoon damage in order to enjoy a filmmakers skill at playing with the conventions of genre is bloody depressing. If people of any sex are going to hurt one another the hurt ought to at least be for high political or moral stakes -- just ask James Bond Jason Bourne or Lisbeth Salander. Yet there are no stakes at all in Haywire where government types and shadowy private operators are interchangeable plot pawns as are their goals. The movies only point is to showcase Carano an attractive impressive fighter who caught Steven Soderberghs eye while she was doing her Muay Thai/boxing/jujitsu thing on TV. Luckily for the director taking such a gamble Carano projects an intriguing aura in her dramatic-acting debut -- part smoky dark-haired sexuality part bruiser with an uninflected alto voice that cuts through crap. (Her voice was digitally lowered in postproduction.) Plus she fights real good. Inspired the filmmaker worked up a characteristically confident riff on spy thrillers imported martial-arts pics and cable-TV exhibition fights all rolled into one loose caper. Where he previously marshaled his abiding interest in processes (how to fight big business in Erin Brockovich how to stage a heist in the Oceans trilogy how to stop an epidemic in the outstanding 2011 scary movie Contagion) Soderbergh now noodles meaninglessly with the process of a woman running from pursuers on city rooftops and mowing them down with weapons when necessary. Haywire cavorts around the world -- Barcelona Dublin upstate New York New Mexico -- with Bourne-again energy and timeline shuffles making only cursory attempts at plot coherence Mallory was double-crossed on a mysterious assignment and with her life in jeopardy she goes rogue or something like that. (Screenplay credit goes to Lem Dobbs who previously collaborated with Soderbergh on Kafka and The Limey.) For a dusting of star power Ewan McGregor Michael Douglas Antonio Banderas and Michael Fassbender play men who are not to be trusted. The coffee-shop bout between Carano and Tatum is nothing by the way compared with the Grand Guignol damage Carano and Fassbender wreak on each other in a Dublin hotel room. Haywire is zippy and visually sophisticated with tonal palettes color-coded (as in Traffic) to help make sense of time and place. But it zips to nowhere fun only for those who agree to enjoy watching a woman inflict pain like a man for the dumb pleasure of watching her fight. To this referee thats movie sensibility gone haywire.

Haywire Fair to good Director Steven Soderbergh. Cast Gina Carano Ewan McGregor Michael Fassbender. Rating R for some violence. Spotlight Ewan McGregor Kick-butt chicks ""You shouldnt think of her as a woman"" the man says. ""That would be a mistake."" Its a funny line and its intent is clear Mallory played by mixed martial-arts star Gina Carano can stand toe-to-toe with any male agent. She is just as deadly if not more so so if you underestimate her you do so at your peril. But not think of her as a woman? Isnt that the point? Soderbergh plays with the action genre by planting a real fighter in the role of butt-kicking protagonist and Carano rises to the challenge. Women have done this kind of thing before in some films but rarely if ever with the bone-crunching intensity and physicality Carano brings to the role. The look style and feel of the film calls to mind James Bond movies from the 60s and 70s -- Soderbergh gives plenty of nods in that direction -- only instead of a suave gent in a tuxedo its Carano and she somehow makes it seem more deadly. Its obvious that Mallory -- and Carano -- has done this kind of thing before. The film begins with Mallory a former U.S. Marine now doing quieter messier jobs for a private contractor meeting fellow agent Aaron (Channing Tatum) in a diner where the friendly chat turns suddenly violent. Hot coffee in the face heads smashed kick after kick and soon Mallory has grabbed frightened kid Scott (Michael Angarano) and his car and hit the road. As she drives she explains what led to the fight in the diner; screenwriter Lem Dobbs framing device is offbeat and effective. Shadowy figures abound. Coblenz (Michael Douglas) and Rodrigo (a bearded Antonio Banderas) insist that Kenneth (Ewan McGregor) Mallorys boss send her along with Aaron and a couple of other agents to Barcelona to extract a kidnapped dissident journalist (Anthony Brandon Wong). Its a successful mission that includes a great chase scene on foot that ends as does just about every scene in the movie with Mallory pummeling someone. Next Kenneth sends Mallory to Dublin to accompany British agent Paul (Michael Fassbender) on a quick mission. Shell just be eye candy Mallory complains. Itll be like a paid vacation Kenneth insists. This turns out not to be the case. Through yet more enthusiastically acrobatic violence it becomes clear that Mallory has been betrayed. So she spends the balance of the film figuring out who is behind the betrayal and dishing out revenge of the kick-your-teeth-in variety. She is assisted quietly in this by the one person she trusts her father (Bill Paxton) himself a former Marine. So no in truth the story isnt much. Just betrayal and revenge basically. But a couple of things make ""Haywire"" a lot of fun to watch. One is the cast. To recap Michael Douglas Ewan McGregor Antonio Banderas Michael Fassbender and Bill Paxton. Thats a whole lot of cool in one place. The other more-crucial ingredient though is Carano. She doesnt do a lot of what youd call acting -- just monotone line readings for the most part (she has acknowledged that her voice was altered for the film). But Soderbergh makes this a strength. Carano has other ways of communicating her feelings most of which involve a choice elbow to the throat or a kick in the crotch. She firmly establishes herself as the equal of any of her male counterparts in the genre and the female ones too. Well one -- Angelina Jolie pretty well had that category to herself. Until now. Carano kicks butt plain and simple. Thanks to the chance Soderbergh takes with her ""Haywire"" pretty much does as well. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

"Haywire (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Haywire (R) MMA star Gina Carano is the best thing about Steven Soderberghs undercooked action thriller. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com1/18/2012 Editor rating 2 Steven Soderbergh has been telling interviewers that hes planning to take a sabbatical from filmmaking because he has lost his inspiration. His lack of interest is palpable in Haywire a rote exercise in action filmmaking that is sleek and polished and instantly evaporates from memory. More unusual for Soderbergh is that the movie isnt even all that fun to watch Once you get over the novelty of watching mixed martial arts fighter Gina Carano beat up her male co-stars the film has practically nothing else to offer. Haywire was written by Lem Dobbs who previously collaborated with Soderbergh on Kafka and The Limey the latter being one of the directors most entertaining movies as well as an ingenious deconstruction of revenge-drama formulas. Haywire sports a similarly fragmented chronology but the various shifts in time and place dont build toward anything and Soderbergh isnt interested in doing anything radical with the action genre either. He shoots the fight scenes as if they were musical numbers often keeping the actors entire bodies in the frame and holding on shots as long as possible. But whenever people arent kicking or punching each other the films energy sags. Carano who hadnt acted in movies until Soderbergh sought her out is an engaging screen presence She brings an inner life to her character of Mallory Kane a covert-ops soldier who specializes in the sort of missions the government never owns up to. Her eyes radiate intelligence and depth and Carano seems capable of doing a lot more than close-quarters combat or parkour-style stunts. But the movie doesnt know what to do with her other than to send a procession of baddies and double-crossing agents her way. Haywire starts promisingly with a sudden eruption of violence between Carano and Channing Tatum that catches you off-guard followed by a long sequence in Dublin in which she pairs up with another spy (Michael Fassbender) who may be planning to kill her. There is also an unusual car chase that comes to a startling end. But once the script starts to reveal the complicated answer to the question ""Who betrayed Mallory and why?"" Haywire becomes increasingly dull. Soderberghs trademark emotional coolness so effective in movies such as Contagion this time signifies the directors detachment. There is some fun to be had in watching actors such as Ewan McGregor Michael Douglas and Antonio Banderas playing shady characters whose allegiances arent always clear. But Soderbergh who is capable of making even the driest subject matter fascinating isnt interested in the cloak-and-dagger stuff. Haywire is more about the fight scenes than the stuff that comes in between them which makes it no different than your typical Jean Claude Van Damme picture Its simply more stylish and better made. Carano is a bonafide livewire who looks as good in an evening dress as she does in sweats and a hoodie. She takes the movie a lot more seriously than Soderbergh does though. Tired and remote Haywire is the work of a filmmaker in dire need of a vacation. Cast Gina Carano Ewan McGregor Michael Fassbender Channing Tatum Michael Douglas Antonio Banderas Bill Paxton Michael Angarano. Director Steven Soderbergh. Screenwriter Lem Dobbs. Producer Gregory Jacobs. A Relativity Media release. Running time 93 minutes. Vulgar language bone-crunching violence. Opens Friday Jan. 20 at area theaters.

"Haywire | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; haywire ) Haywire (United States/Ireland 2012) January 18 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli Steven Soderberghs Haywire exhibits a remarkable economy of screen time - unusual in an era of bloated action films in which even throw-aways challenge the two hour mark. In fact one could argue that Haywire is too short. Its enjoyable enough in a lightweight sort of way that an extra ten or fifteen minutes would have been welcome. Then again such an increase might have watered down the relentless pace which pauses only when necessary to provide a little exposition or to set up the next scene. This is one of the directors mainstream efforts although his penchant for the offbeat and oddly artistic has not been completely reined in. But theres plenty of unsparing bone-crunching violence to dismiss the idea that Soderbergh is making an art film in disguise. Soderbergh is known for being inventive when casting his films. Although hes not averse to using a Big Name Star like a Julia Roberts or a George Clooney to add a dose of Hollywood he has also been known to veer off in unconventional directions. For The Girlfriend Experience he went to the adult industry and crossed-over Sasha Grey. Now for Haywire he has turned to the world of Mixed Martial Arts and recruited Gina Carano. Carano has plenty of experience playing herself but not so much playing a character. In a move that could have been disastrous had Carano proven to be inept at her new craft Soderbergh surrounds her with Recognizable Names - Ewan McGregor Michael Fassbender Antonio Banderas Michael Douglas and Bill Paxton. Shes not going to win an Oscar but she holds her own and when it comes to physical stunts theres no need for trickery. Maybe shell be the Next Action Hero(ine). We could use one. The best weve got right now is Matt Damon and hes too well-rounded to spend all his time kicking ass and taking numbers. Haywire is sort of a stripped-down Bourne Identity or License to Kill. The plot is pure Spy Thriller 101 - an elite agent is betrayed by her superiors targeted for termination then turns the tables and goes after them to prove her innocence and earn her revenge. In this case Mallory Kane (Carano) isnt working directly for the CIA or MI6 shes part of a team that is subcontracted for sticky jobs where government agents like Coblenz (Michael Douglas) need to maintain a degree of plausible deniability. After finishing a job in Barcelona in fine fashion Mallory is sent by her boss Kenneth (Ewan McGregor) to Dublin. There she is to team up with Paul (Michael Fassbender) and proceed with the mission. The whole thing is a frame-up and that sets off a chain of events that ends with Mallory in a small diner in upstate New York beating the crap out of her former lover Aaron (Channing Tatum) which is where we come in during the opening scene. Soderbergh elects to take about 2/3 of the movie setting things up in flashback with only the final 30 minutes occurring in ""real time."" The meat of the story takes place in Dublin and thats all part of the narrative Mallory tells to a good Samaritan (Michael Angarano) who helps her out in her fight with Aaron. Theres a legitimate reason to present the tale this way - it allows a focus on the highlights of Barcelona and Dublin without any extraneous ""linking"" material. With Mallory narrating the movie can skip ahead at will using her words to fill in any blanks. This technique is a key reason why Haywire clocks in with such a skinny running time. A more traditional approach would have added at least fifteen minutes to the proceedings. Haywires defining characteristic is its look. It hasnt been shot like most action thrillers. The credit (or blame depending on your point-of-view) is squarely on Soderberghs shoulders since he acts as cinematographer for his films. The selection of shots is as random and varied as the foods one might find on a hungry mans plate at a buffet black amp; white filtered with desaturated colors filmed from above filmed from over-the-shoulder filmed with a handheld camera (shaky only in early scenes). Although some of the directors choices seem to be without rhyme or reason others accomplish a specific goal. An example occurs when Mallory walks down a street to escape an attempt on her life. Tension is generated primarily through shot selection from in front of her looking over her shoulder. Is the danger the man paralleling her across the street? Is it the car pulling away from the curb? Is it crossing a side street? Or is there no danger and its all paranoia? The fight scenes are long and brutal. As is the case with action thrillers the characters take the kinds of beatings only superhumans could survive. Mallory repeatedly gets the shit kicked out of her but still looks pretty good (although she does have to employ a little makeup to hide a few bruises after one particularly vicious encounter). Theres some inventiveness in a snowy car chase and more than a little bit of tongue-in-cheek humor laced throughout. In fact the biggest laugh results from the way that car chase is punctuated. Like most movies of this sort Haywire has its share of plot holes but screenwriter Lem Dobbs (who has written among other things Dark City and The Limey - the latter for Soderbergh) is an accomplished enough storyteller to make sure they dont stick out like a sore thumb while the viewer is ""in the moment."" This is not ""great"" Soderbergh regardless of whether one considers him as an auteur or a mass market entertainer. But it is ""good"" Soderbergh and thats more than enough. Haywire is fun and I wouldnt mind seeing the next chapter in Mallorys adventures. Its past time we had a female action hero to rival Ellen Ripley.

Relax Steven Its Worse Than You Think ha-wi(-@)r (adv or adj) being out of order or having gone wrong By Rex Reed  01/17/12 739pm Carano. (Claudette Barius/Five Continents Imports LLC) Just what we need -- another violent comic-book fantasy about another covert government operative (a catch-phrase that describes just about everybody in escapist-action franchise movies from incoherent Tom Cruise Mission Impossible flicks to Jason Bourne cinematic Xeroxes with Matt Damon). This one is called Haywire. The only difference is that this time the battering ram doing all the kickboxing slicing and killing is a woman more or less played since she cannot act by kung fu expert karate specialist martial arts star and Angelina Jolie wannabe Gina Carano. Shes a female boxer who was defeated in 2009 by Cristiane ""Cyborg"" Santos in the Strikeforce Womens Championship whatever that is. The men she beats the crap out of are an all-star bevy of camera-ready hunks baring their pecs in faceless roles to sell tickets. They are wasting their time but boy do we need them. It is doubtful that the box-office flame exuded by Ms. Carano on her own could draw moths. Haywire makes no sense whatsoever which should come as no surprise. Its the latest brainless exercise in self-indulgence from Steven Soderbergh whose films rarely make any sense anyway. (I liked Erin Brockovitch but I now think it was a fluke that will never come again.) Any director who wastes valuable time watching female boxing instead of learning how to make better movies has lost me already. In the opening scene Channing Tatum walks into a roadside diner in upstate New York and smacks the living daylights out of a woman named Mallory Kane played by Ms. Carano with more muscles than charm. Naturally she turns the tables and leaves him unconscious steals a car belonging to a mind-blown young man named Scott (Michael Angarano) and drives away. Screeching and careering through the snow she relates everything that happened to her as Scott works hard to keep from screaming before hes excised from the movie and never seen again. Cut to Washington D.C. where the overexposed Ewan McGregor is instructed by boss Michael Douglas to eliminate the two-fisted Mallory. Flashback even further to Barcelona where she and Mr. Tatum were once lovers on a hostage-rescue mission before she discovered she was marked for assassination. In Dublin while tracking down a Chinese nationalist she poses as the wife of another secret agent played with typical out-of-the-shower tight-towel nakedness by gym-pumped Michael Fassbender but instead of taking her to bed he tries to take her out. In retaliation she chokes him with thighs like sandbags during Hurricane Katrina and fires a bullet through his handsome head. Trying to figure out why shes been betrayed in an interminable series of splat-crack-pow scenes she turns into a rogue agent and goes viral throwing herself off rooftops smashing through plate-glass windows leaping from one building to another bouncing off walls and kicking a lot of groins. It all ends up back in the present at the elegant New Mexico home of her father a former Marine turned best-selling author curiously played by the sturdy and dependable Bill Paxton who is very good very brief and very much reduced to the status of a walk-on. Surprise The anonymous killers and thugs show up and theres more fighting to come as she demolishes a lot of beautiful furniture and marvelous architecture heading for one last showdown with one final master criminal (Antonio Banderas unrecognizable behind a bushy mouse-gray beard). One can only wonder what Mr. Soderbergh paid so many first-cabin alpha males to make fools of themselves in this piece of junk. The leap-frog settings across two continents are more eloquent than anything in the dumb sophomoric script by Lem Dobbs who also wrote the screenplay for Mr. Soderberghs pretentious and unwatchable Kafka. You realize early that nobody connected with Haywire has any interest in coherent narrative filmmaking. The movie is nothing more than a locker-room joke. Nothing resembling plot character development or a star-making career move of any kind is anywhere apparent. The whole point of this time-wasting farrago of idiocy is that women can cut kick slash burn maim and kill just like men--and make bad movies that are just as stupid. Mr. Soderbergh doesnt even try to guide his unknown inexperienced leading lady from the fight ring to the acting arena. He just cranks up the camera and lets her punch herself catatonic. Maybe its the role shes playing but Gina Carano has all the charisma of a Sherman tank. rreedobserver.com HAYWIRE Running Time 93 minutes Written by Lem Dobbs Directed by Steven Soderbergh Starring Gina Carano Ewan McGregor and Michael Fassbender 1/4 Comment Filed under Bourne CIA Espionage Ewan McGregor Gina Carano Michael Fassbender mission impossible movie Movie Review Steven Soderbergh Thriller Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture The (Real) Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia Origin Story Culture Radiohead Transformed Madison Square Garden Into A Moon Shaped Pool Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP",http://www.observer.com/2012/01/haywire-rex-reed-gina-carano-steven-soderbergh/,200,haywire34,haywire,observer

With the high-style Haywire Soderbergh takes the most hackneyed secret-agent-double-crossed-by-her-paymasters storyline imaginable and directs the living hell out of it. In a move similar to his casting of pornstar Sasha Grey in 2009s The Girlfriend Experience he drafts in Gina Carano - AKA ex-American Gladiator Crush - as svelte skull-smashing special operative Mallory Kane.What follows is a feminist tirade in the mould of Kill Bill as Mallory navigates the globe and coolly makes a string of potential assassins - Michael Fassbender Channing Tatum and a ratty side-parted Ewan McGregor - her unwitting punchbags. The combat scenes are ferocious beautiful and refreshingly original with the conventional frantic editing and ear-splitting techno stripped away to leave something closer to silent ballet (with pained grunting). David Holmess moodily effective Martini-time jazz soundtrack only kicks in when Mallory takes to tracking down her various shady aggressors. A horribly realistic hotel room fracas with Fassbender could even be deemed one of the all-time great fight scenes. To prove that hes taking all the pseudo-serious expositionary dialogue with a pinch of salt Soderbergh infuses the material with various nods to Hitchcock classics like Notorious and North by Northwest and the finale is a brutal comic inversion of the iconic beach canoodling scene in From Here to Eternity.

Shes a tad wooden at times but the supporting cast is pretty decent (aside from McGregor who is either fabulous or weedy...here hes by far the latter and utterly unconvincing as an evil crime boss). With so many big names many are wasted (Douglas and Banderas phone in their performances) including Paxton (looking bored) and Fassbender (aside from his epic hotel-room scrap with Carano).

Probably one of the worst reviews ive ever read so inaccurate its astonishing and the quote about best fight scene is clearly coming from someone who doesnt watch many action films. The film as a whole lacks any type of substance and however much you try and cover that up with jazzed up music and decent camera work (although not sure it suited the film much) you cant hide a very bad script.

After all the reviews that mentioned deconstruction of the genre I was expecting something with far more wit. You can tell from the lazy storyline (simple bad guys simple motives) that the writer(s) didnt think there was much point in creating anything memorable as all action films are the same. Thats fair enough. Action films are formulaic. However if you show contempt for the genre by not bothering to create anything half memorable - then what you end up with is not a deconstruction of the genre. What you end up with is just a pretty crap action film - like Haywire. Look at the Bourne films (formulaic and unoriginal) but they are great films because they are done with so much conviction (great directing writing and acting). Conversely with Haywire you have a talented cast and director completely wasted with a half-arsed script. Carano stands out in her action scenes. She certainly shows that shes more than just acting - she knows what shes doing. Apart from that there really are no other plus points with Haywire.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 24 2012KentishTownerFeaturedTime Outs film reviews get more unreliable with every issue.

Yes it is a feminist Bourne and I could see the best of Paul Greengrass in this. Carano is good lithe and muscly enough to be believed as an assassin yet still feminine enough to be more than a musclebound killing machine. Douglas is good as the government puppet master and McGregor is excellent as the devious boss. I agree with the reviewers Kill Bill analogy. Enough baddies left to make another film and the ending was perhaps too sudden for there not already to be a Haywire 2 plotted and planned. Good and worth seeing. I can also see the point raised re the style over substance by Scrumpyjack. Worth 3 stars but not 4.

Steven Soderberghs action-filmmaking chops get a swift vigorous 92-minute workout in ""Haywire."" So too does Gina Carano a coolly charismatic mixed-martial-arts star plucked from the relative obscurity of televised cage matches to play a skilled assassin on the run from powerful men who want her dead. Paring down narrative and character concerns in favor of a breathtaking application of pure thriller technique Soderberghs latest picture is a lean efficient exercise tossed off with his customary sangfroid and wickedly dry sense of humor. A name-heavy supporting cast should spell reasonably muscular returns and killer ancillary biz. Slated for a Jan. 20 release ""Haywire"" was actually shot and completed before Soderberghs disease drama ""Contagion"" to which it serves as a sleek escapist companion piece -- another casually star-studded globe-trotting thriller about the systems inability to contain a lethal fast-moving rogue element. In this case its Mallory Kane (Carano) a raven-haired beauty expertly trained by the military and routinely tapped by a nameless security contractor to do the governments dirty work. First seen entering a diner in wintry upstate New York Mallory is approached by someone who seems to be an old friend Aaron (Channing Tatum). Their cryptic exchange suddenly becomes a coffee-splashing groin-jabbing head-smashing melee the first of several brutish spasms of violence that jolt the film every so often out of its pleasurably low-key vibe. Gaining the upper hand Mallory drives off with shaken bystander Scott (Michael Angarano) who becomes a willing hostage and listener as she explains the chain of events that led her to this point. Roughly the next 45 minutes are devoted to a series of flashbacks kicking off with a mysterious assignment in Barcelona where Mallory and Aaron are part of a crack team assigned to rescue a captive Chinese journalist (Anthony Brandon Wong). The job comes off smoothly enough in a near-wordless montage cut together with rippling precision and timed to the jazzy percussive riffs of David Holmes score. Its a doozy of a setpiece that pushes action-movie mechanics into a realm of giddily heightened abstraction only to come back to earth with a raw visceral scene of hand-to-hand combat between Mallory and an enemy assailant -- one of two hold-your-breath sequences that drew spontaneous applause from the pics AFI Film Festival audience. Operating behind the scenes are various men in suits including reptilian exec Coblenz (Michael Douglas); suave gray-bearded client Rodrigo (Antonio Banderas); and Mallorys weaselly chief contact Kenneth (Ewan McGregor). Its Kenneth who sends Mallory to Dublin for a quick job that requires her to don gorgeous evening wear and hang on the arm of debonair Irishman Paul (Michael Fassbender). Naturally shes walking into a trap albeit one shes too smart and instinctively suspicious not to recognize as such. Its all fairly routine cloak-and-dagger stuff and the amusingly terse script by Lem Dobbs (who previously collaborated with Soderbergh on 1999s ""The Limey"") wastes little time attempting to individuate its characters or the double-cross scenarios in which they find themselves. The thrill of ""Haywire"" derives from the fluidity of the filmmaking from the unique visual inflections and fleet rhythms Soderbergh achieves as d.p. and editor (working under his usual pseudonyms) to the cameras unblinking almost deadpan record of Caranos altogether astounding displays of athletic prowess (expertly choreographed by J.J. Perry). Conceived with an eye toward expanding the market for female action stars who arent Angelina Jolie the film doesnt give Carano much opportunity to suggest hidden depths or even exude a strong sense of mystery. But shes an alert engaged performer whose lightning-quick reflexes and resourceful command of her own body -- squeezing her legs around a mans neck shes like a particularly fatal contortionist -- are enough to maintain a chokehold on the viewers rooting interest. Much as he did with Sasha Grey in ""The Girlfriend Experience"" Soderbergh has cast a relative newcomer from beyond the traditional talent pool and tailored an unconventional vehicle to suit her specific off-Hollywood persona. It remains to be seen if the result is a star-making debut but its a vivid and arresting one regardless. The bigger-name thesps generally serve little purpose other than to provide a lineup of A-list punching bags although Tatum delivers a flicker of something more as Mallorys conflicted colleague/lover/nemesis as does Bill Paxton in the role of her ever-concerned quietly proud papa. Shot on the 4K Red One camera and visually of a piece with Soderberghs downmarket digital offerings the film nonetheless possesses a remarkable elegance and elan shifting from hot yellow overtones early on to cooler blues and grays as it wends its way from Spain through Ireland to New Mexico. Curiously while the mayhem plays out in a manner worthy of its title ""Haywire"" never seems less than fully in control of its own effects.

Daily Edition Login to download Haywire Film Review 1251 PM PST 11/7/2011 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Relativity Martial arts maestra Gina Casrano convincingly kicks considerable ass in Steven Soderberghs engaging action lark. TWITTER Gina Carano stars as a covert operative who proceeds to whup a succession of macho leading men in addition to assorted anonymous foes. Imagine an entire action film dedicated to the proposition that every fight possesses the intensity of the classic Sean Connery-Robert Shaw to-the-death scrap in From Russia With Love and youll know what Haywire is all about. With all the feel of a vacation from more high-minded and ambitious projects Steven Soderbergh celebrates making his 25th feature film within 22 years with a kick-ass international action romp toplining mixed martial arts star Gina Carano as a covert operative who proceeds to whup a succession of macho leading men in addition to assorted anonymous foes; shes Pepper to Angelinas Salt. World-premiered as a surprise sneak preview at Hollywoods AFI Fest this Relativity release should enjoy a solid commercial career with action-seeking male and female audiences upon its Jan. 20 release. A handsome black-haired hardbody who wears an evening dress as easily as she does a hoodie Carano exudes the sort of self-confidence and physical wherewithal that leaves no doubt she can prevail in any situation. This is essential because the film rides upon ones certainty that her character Mallory Kane an international troubleshooter assigned to off-the-books missions can take out virtually any guy in mano a mano combat. Soderbergh shoots her half-a-dozen or so fight scenes without doubles or cheat editing emphasizing his stars abilities to the extent that the semblance and extremity of the combats reality becomes the films entire raison detre. STORY AFI Fest The 8 Films on Everyones Radar In this Haywire entirely and winningly succeeds. In one sequence she chases a young man across half of Barcelona until she catches up with him and lets him have it. Elsewhere she bounces off walls leaps from one building to another employs a devastating leg lock exhibits extraordinary backward driving skills shoots unerringly slams guys into assorted hard surfaces knows just where to kick and once sensing shes met a physical complement makes out with a young hunk. VIDEO Comic-Con 2011 Gina Carano Michael Douglas in Haywire Trailer Soderbergh and scenarist Lem Dobbs who previously wrote Kafka and The Limey for the director seem keen to admit that the action scenes are the point of the film content to construct a plainly generic story around them. Its a straight revenge tale with Mallory fighting her way through assorted muscle-bound well-armed and otherwise formidable obstacles in order to find out who set her up for assassination after she pulled off the Barcelona job. The script makes no attempt to assert its plausibility or realism; it is instead refreshingly frank about what it is a simple workable framework for the melees and mayhem. Haywire gets right down to the business in the opening scene a very rough tussle between Mallory and an agent (Channing Tatum) with whom she has history. Escaping in a car with a freaked-out young man named Scott (Michael Angarano) she relates whats led up to this tense moment beginning with the Barcelona caper which Mallory pulled off with great panache. PHOTO Comic-Con 2011 Steven Soderberghs Haywire Teaser Poster Makes Debut Mallorys point man (Ewan McGregor with a very dorky haircut) then sends her to Dublin on unwanted arm-candy duty with another operative the dashing Paul (Michael Fassbender in glamor-boy mode). The two are very well matched physically in their sophistication and their ruthlessness which becomes apparent when Paul instead of putting the make on her tries to kill her. Their prolonged struggle which demolishes a suite at the Shelbourne Hotel is a tour de force for the performers director and whoever else helped work out all the moves. Now knowing shes been betrayed Mallory dedicates herself to getting back to the U.S. but must first contend with a platoon of agents who chase her through the streets and across the rooftops of Dublin. Her international travel difficulties conveniently skipped over the yarn rejoins the present-day as Mallory and Scotts getaway is abruptly ended so as to force the story to the grand New Mexico home of Mallorys father (a very good Bill Paxton). It turns out Mallory is just a daddys girl after all the daughter of a former Marine (as she is too) who is now a renowned author of modern warfare nonfiction. The house becomes the setting for films rough penultimate battle before Mallory settles up accounts with her superiors who also include the smooth top man played by Michael Douglas and a more shadowy figure portrayed by Antonio Banderas mostly in a bushy graying beard. STORY AFI Fest Secret Screening Is Steven Soderberghs Haywire The fine use of locations elegantly mobile shooting style and hair-trigger editing are all in line with what one expects from Soderbergh. But here the generally larky but serious-when-it-needs-to-be tone is set by the wildly diverse musical contributions of David Holmes whose film score-sampling background and blues-and-jazz techno orientation yield many different flavors to occasionally jarring but overall bouyant effect. As solid as all the male actors are in the end the show belongs to Soderbergh who took a risk with a largely untested leading lady and Carano whose shoulders and everything else prove plenty strong enough to carry the film. The director shrewdly determined what she could and perhaps couldnt do and she delivered with a turn that makes other actresses who have attempted such roles no matter how toned and buff they became look like pretenders.
