Entertainment ""Mad Max Fury Road"" Makes The Apocalypse Look So Very Glorious Happy end of the world. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Tom Hardy in Mad Max Fury Road. Jasin Boland / Warner Bros. ID 5714630 The world has totally gone to hell in Mad Max Fury Road and goddamn does it look great. Its fitting that a week before the arrival of Tomorrowland Brad Bird and Damon Lindelofs earnest argument in favor of hopeful futurescapes the face-melting fourth installment to George Millers franchise is gunning into theaters to suggest theres nothing like the flame-out of humanity for unprecedented spectacle. The movie makes a fume-drunk totally convincing case for how thematically lavish and awesome-looking the apocalypse can be as long as you dont have to live there.Its not necessary to have seen the early Mad Max movies to get the gist of where things lie in the indeterminate future of Mad Max Fury Road though its funny to look back at the Australia of the first installment and remember that it had diners and a court system and that its main character had something terrible happen to him while on vacation. Fury Road is so beyond those trappings of civilization that its practically alien taking place on an Earth thats all wasteland a desiccated dusty stretch as far as the eye can see. What survivors are left prey on one another out on the open road or by way of tyrannical tribal societies.These survivors exist among the tattered remnants of mankind in the kind of place that would drive a fellow insane. And the title character is pretty solidly off his rocker though judging by the unsurprised reactions of everyone he encounters this is not an uncommon condition. Hes come a long way from the Max Rockatansky of the first movie too so far in fact that hes a new man. Tom Hardy taking over for Mel Gibson portrays Max as a feral animal grunting out his few lines and in the first moment we see him chomping on an unfortunate lizard that happened to scurry by. Jasin Boland / Warner Bros. Jasin Boland / Warner Bros. ID 5715704 Even by the franchises fuzzy timeline Max should be getting on in years so theres something reassuring and fantastic about the way the recasting suggests that in the 30 years since we last saw him hes barely aged. Like James Bond hes become as much an idea as a person wandering eternally into and out of the lives of humankinds remainders like the reworked cataclysmic Western antihero he is. In Mad Max Fury Road he blunders into the path of Imperator Furiosa (a terrific Charlize Theron) who drives an amped-up big rig for warlord Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne who played Toecutter in the first film) and whos about to make a risky bid for freedom along with the mans five formerly captive young wives.Mad Max Fury Road which director Miller wrote with Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris is one gigantic chase sequence in which Furiosa and the women in her keeping make a wild run for a maybe-mythic sanctuary they call ""green place"" while multiple war parties chase them down. The details of whats become of the world trickle out at the sides of the action -- there is blissfully no stopping so that someone can unleash an informational monologue about how Immortan Joes warped excuse for a community works. View this image > Jasin Boland / Warner Bros. ID 5715735 We understand that Immortan Joe has built a death cult with his War Boys a set of young men with terminal illnesses who look interchangeable with their skull makeup and other scarification and who chase destruction because of the promises of Valhalla. (One of them Nux played by Nicholas Hoult manages to emerge from the nearly identical pack.) We also understand that Immortan Joe controls the only regular non-toxic water supply in the area doling it out to the hardscrabble crowd living in his shadow and cautioning them not to get addicted as if the need for water were a matter of willpower.Miller appreciates that every aspect of the world doesnt need to be explained for it to feel solid. Why provide an explanation when you can sear it into the brains of your audience with such savagely evocative imagery? This includes a series of escalating high-speed battles in which characters leap or are thrown from vehicle to vehicle hurl spears strapped with explosives and swing back and forth on poles like dangerous metronomes -- Wacky Races as reenacted with flesh-and-blood people who are either crazed or desperate enough to take unimaginable risks. Its so richly detailed that you can read volumes into passing observations like the fact that Immortan Joe rides with a decadent doomsday equivalent of war drums -- a truck outfitted with massive speakers and a gimp-masked man playing a flamethrower guitar.But more than the dizzying clashes on the road Mad Max Fury Road troubles the mind with recurring glimpses of human beings being harvested. Bodies have become the most important resource at a time when everyones covered with tumors sores and deformations from their increasingly poisonous environs not to mention scars and wounds from their encounters with each other. When Max first ends up in Immortan Joes Citadel its only because he was unlucky enough to be spotted by scavengers. Hes been captured to be used as a source of reenergizing bodily fluids for the more sickly War Boys. View this image > Jasin Boland / Warner Bros. ID 5715124 Nux who takes Max into battle chained to the front of his car like a hood ornament refers to him almost affectionately as ""Blood Bag."" Women are shown getting milked like cows. Cannibalism may never be depicted but its the undercurrent of every grotesque glimpse of life in the compound. If the human species is going down the strong are going to be the last ones standing warming their hands over the burning corpses of everyone weaker. Conversely one of the movies most poignant moments involves a character willingly offering up blood to someone whos been hurt.The bodies of the young women Furiosa is trying to rescue played by Rosie Huntington-Whiteley Zoe Kravitz Riley Keough Courtney Eaton and Abbey Lee are also commodities ones Immortan Joe and his allies are willing to risk everything to retrieve -- especially those pregnant with a possible future heir. He even demands from one the baby shes carrying insisting its his stolen property. That female bodily integrity has been torched in this testosterone-filled nightmare state isnt a surprise -- what is pleasantly is the way that Mad Max Fury Road refuses to let this be an excuse to also treat its women like so much meat. The wives emerge as distinct and disparate personalities even if all of the time we spend with them is on the run. Splendid (Huntington-Whiteley) is defiant while Fragile (Eaton) is so shattered by her experiences she tries to return to her abuser rather than risk making him more angry and Capable (Keough) forms a wistful connection to an unlikely character.These characters are not MacGuffins not just objects over which the men can fight and Furiosa is no sidekick. Shes as much the protagonist of the movie as Max with whom she at first comes to blows before settling on a cautious detente. The two arrive at a deeper understanding over the course of their journey all without bothering to talk things out -- theyre just two fearsome survivors who recognize in one another some last flickers of humanity. View this image > Jasin Boland / Warner Bros. ID 5715778 With her shaved head and her robotic arm Furiosa has all the trappings of an iconic action heroine but Theron channels her emotional performance through her eyes which are steady but haunted beneath the black war paint. Furiosa knows shes probably going to die and has decided its worth it to chase one last bit of hope for a place that hasnt gone completely deranged. Sometimes you search for a home and sometimes you have to make one. In Mad Max Fury Road the ultimate glory isnt in how extravagantly and brutally the world is being destroyed with its explosions like blossoms across the desert but in how its characters beat back those who are reveling in its destruction.

"Mad Max Fury Road | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; mad-max-fury-road ) Mad Max Fury Road (Australia/United States 2015) May 13 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli Mad Max Fury Road delivers. Theres no clearer or more succinct way to put it. 30 years after last appearing on the big screen Max roars back with a vengeance. Part reboot part sequel and part something entirely different Fury Road takes us on a trip that is both like and unlike the earlier excursions. George Miller uses a new cast and a sizeable budget to deliver the Mad Max film he always wanted to make but was never quite able to. Talk about taking things to a new level... Theaters showing Fury Road should have seat belts installed. The three decade gap between Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome and Fury Road was more a product of circumstances than a lack of effort on Millers part. During the hiatus he tried numerous times to get the project started but issues related to Mel Gibsons rise (and later fall) as Hollywoods biggest star and problems with finding a location kept the picture on the shelf after several mis-starts. One can make a compelling argument that the movie may have been helped by the long delay - not only did it allow a younger man (with less baggage) to take over the lead but it gave Miller more time to refine the ""spectacle"" aspect which in the final analysis is by far Fury Roads biggest selling point. When we consider summer action films this is what we think of. Constructed as an almost-two hour chase sequence (with only a 15-minute cooling-down period about halfway through) Fury Road combines the pyrotechnics of a Michael Bay extravaganza with the physics-defying razzle dazzle of a Fast and Furious outing. The post-apocalyptic setting is the test tube in which adrenaline and testosterone combine into an explosive cocktail. However despite all the action excitement and mayhem the characters come across as well defined. Miller spends just enough time on their background and interaction to breathe life into what easily could have been (as in Bays films) cardboard cut-outs. As is always the case in an action movie things work because we care about what happens to the protagonist. Too often when special effects rule the screen this doesnt happen. Fury Road is a welcome exception. The movie transpires in the same blasted Omega Man-style future where Mad Max The Road Warrior and Beyond Thunderdome took place. When all the worlds a desert water becomes a precious commodity.  And when freedom comes only from long distance transportation gasoline is a close second. The storyline is straightforward Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) a loner haunted by the deaths of his wife and daughter (events told in the first Mad Max movie released in 1979) joins forces with Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) to defy a warlord (Hugh Keays-Byrne) by stealing his five wives Splendid (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) Toast (Zoe Kravitz) Capable (Riley Keough) The Dag (Abbey Lee) and Fragile (Courtney Eaton). Joined by ""war boy"" Nux (Nicholas Hoult) they seek to free the women from captivity and deliver them to a green land to the east. The warlord however is unwilling to let the potential mothers of his children go and mounts a massive manhunt to kill Max and Furiosa and bring back the women. The odds would cause most men to quail but Rockatansky isnt called ""Mad Max"" for nothing. Its legitimate to question who/what the real star of the movie is Hardys Mad Max or Millers Mad Magnificent Visuals. Certainly this is one of the best looking mainstream films to come along in a while. The day scenes are bright and colorful with lots of reds and oranges and the nights are bathed in blue making everything almost black-and-white. The emphasis on practical (old school) special effects over computer generated imagery adds a grittiness to the chases and fights that many films (like the aforementioned Fast and Furious entries) lack. Its also refreshing to experience 3-D where its more of a benefit than a cash-grab. (Although I hasten to add that it doesnt ascend to the top tier occupied by the likes of Avatar and Gravity.) Tom Hardy avoids the George Lazenby effect. Its always difficult following a popular actor who has left an indelible stamp on a role. Lazenby was unable to do that with Bond; Sean Connery loomed large over On Her Majestys Secret Service.  In Fury Road however Hardy is Max from the first scene. It may help that it has been 30 years since Mel Gibson played the role but he isnt missed. Hardy embraces the over-the-top lunacy of the production and gives us a Max who grumbles and snarls his way through 120 minutes of bedlam. Joining Hardy on Fury Road is a nearly-bald Charlize Theron who showed her dedication to the role by shaving her head. Add Therons Furiosa to the pantheon of kick-ass female action heroes alongside Aliens Sigourney Weaver and Terminator 2s Linda Hamilton. Furiosa is less a supporting character in Fury Road than a co-lead; this is as much her story as Maxs. Nicholas Hoult painted white and playing someone more nuts than the main man gives a surprisingly nuanced performance in a film that doesnt prize acting. For those who easily become bored by exposition in action movies Millers approach provides an alternative. The characters backstories are presented via lightning-fast flashbacks a perfunctory voiceover and occasional lines of dialogue. Low octane moments are used economically. Aside from a 15-minute break that allows characters and viewers alike to catch their breaths Fury Road buzzes along at a breakneck clip. For those who found the destructive orgy of car chase chaos in the original trilogy to be a feast Fury Road ups the ante. This drives the concept of the ""summer spectacle"" to its apex.

By Ben Sachs 1bsachs Mad Max Fury Road Mad Max Fury Road  Directed by George Miller This review contains spoilers. Even after two viewings I feel as though Ive only scratched the surface of Mad Max Fury Road. George Millers action fantasy is astonishingly dense for a big-budget spectacle not only in its imagery and ideas but in the complex interplay between them (Chicago Tribune critic Michael Phillips has aptly likened the movie to a symphony). In a sense Fury Road has been gestating since the late 1970s when Miller first envisioned the character of Mad Max and the nightmarish future Australia he inhabits. The movie builds upon motifs from Millers original trilogy with Mel Gibson--Mad Max (1979) The Road Warrior (1981) and Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985)--though its not a sequel but a complete reimagining of the world in those films. Miller began planning this fourth installment as far back as 2001 and claims to have generated so much material during the unusually long preproduction phase that he already has a couple more stories ready to go. Because of this long history (not to mention Millers recent experience directing the childrens animation Happy Feet and its sequel) every shot bustles with imaginative detail--the world of the film feels authentically lived in. Miller reportedly instructed his actors to devise a history for every prop they used and many of those props appear to have been crafted by hand. Most of the film takes place over a few days and much of the action consists of extended chase sequences (indeed Miller originally devised the film as one continuous chase). The story of Fury Road is so simple and the details are so engrossing that one can easily lose track of the characters and just get lost in the design. In this regard it recalls another audacious big-budget fantasy Jacques Tatis Playtime (1967) for which the director constructed elaborate and highly detailed sets of a futuristic Paris. Like the previous two Mad Max movies Fury Road takes place in a postapocalyptic world of scarce natural resources. A tyrant named Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne who played the wicked Toe Cutter in the original Mad Max) has commandeered Australias last remaining source of freshwater and uses this power to rule pharaohlike over the Citadel a mountain community thats grown up around the water supply. In addition to hoarding most of the water for himself and overseeing an army that protects his interests Joe keeps several wives in captivity to bear his children. The story kicks into gear when Joes lieutenant Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) liberates the women and fleeing Joes soldiers sets off with them across the desert to a fabled all-female utopia known as the Green Place. Joes soldiers--a race of bald-headed white-painted grease monkeys known as the War Boys--are one of the movies most ingenious innovations. Brainwashed into devoting their entire lives to the army the War Boys power Joes fleet of military vehicles literally with their own blood--in this future hell bodily fluids are used interchangeably with gasoline. (This detail suggests a comic literalizing of the protest slogan ""No blood for oil."") When we meet Max (Tom Hardy taking over for Mel Gibson) hes in the process of getting captured by a band of War Boys who plan to convert him into a human gas tank. He ends up powering a vehicle thats driven by Nux (Nicholas Hoult) a dogmatic young man who wants nothing more than to die in battle for Joe. After Nux and Max get separated from the army they come to assist Furiosa and the women gradually recognizing the women as worthy peers. Miller and cowriters Brendan McCarthy and Nick Lathouris signal the end of Joes reign--and the arrival of a more democratic society--in how they structure the narrative of Fury Road. For most of the movies first half Miller divides ones attention evenly between Max and Furiosa; the chase scenes in this portion are staged so that one worries about the survival of a single character (or in some cases a single vehicle) being pursued by a murderous horde. After the men and women join forces however Miller and his writers expand their focus so that one cares about the survival of the entire group. The chase scenes in the movies second half find the heroes not just fleeing but combining their wits in order to outsmart their enemies. These sequences are more intricately plotted evoking the visual intricacy of the Citadel. Max and Nux learning to collaborate with the women is presented as such a victory that the groups triumph over Immortan Joe would feel like an afterthought if Miller didnt stage the final battle so spectacularly. At the beginning of Fury Road Max is little more than an animal a violent nomad struggling to endure amidst scavengers and War Boys. The character tells us in voice-over that he went mad after his wife and children were killed and that his mind is too addled to comprehend anything greater than his immediate survival. In learning to work with others Max reclaims his humanity--while Nux whos never known anything besides war and death discovers his. Played by Hoult as an impressionable even cheery little boy Nux is the heart of Fury Road which improbably combines rousing action and fairy-tale idealism with moving results. If Nux is the heart of the movie then Furiosa is its soul a hard-charging but sympathetic warrior committed to finding a better world. One of the big surprises of Fury Road however is that there is no better world to be found. The Green Place turns out to be nothing more than a myth so Max convinces the group to journey back to the Citadel overthrow Immortan Joe and establish a more humane system of government. By the time the characters get back to this marvel of production design you might be glad theyve returned since you have another chance to take in all the incredible-looking stuff. (Im most partial to the band of drummers who play for Joe on rotating platforms hundreds of feet off the ground.) The intricate spectacle of the Citadel exists not for its own sake but for its deep thematic significance. The more invested you feel in Millers fantasy world--or better yet our own real one--the more you want to see it saved from despots and violence.  v Trailer More Movie Review >> Tags Movie Review Mad Max Fury Road George Miller Charlize Theron Tom Hardy Mel Gibson Mad Max Chicago Tribune Michael Phillips The Road Warrior Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome Happy Feet Hugh Keays-Byrne Brendan McCarthy Nick Lathouris Jacques Tati Playtime Recommended Video Email Share Digg Newsvine del.icio.us Facebook Reddit Twitter Windy Citizen Add to favorites Saving...

"Mad Max Fury Road - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire Mad Max Fury Road Posted by Christy Lemire on May 16 2015 33 Comments Warner Bros. Pictures Rated R for intense sequences of violence throughout and for disturbing images. Running time 120 minutes. Four stars out of four. The title of the movie is ""Mad Max Fury Road"" because in theory its driving force is the iconic character at the center of George Millers groundbreaking post-apocalyptic franchise. The actor taking over in the role that made Mel Gibson a star some 35 years ago is Tom Hardy a man who has proven himself to be a formidable force in films like ""Bronson"" ""The Dark Knight Rises"" and ""Warrior."" The trailer alone -- a 2 1/2-minute thrill ride of flying vehicles and fiery skies -- screams with visceral images that sear into your brain and suggest that this must be a masculine and muscular cinematic extravaganza typical of the season. So what a lovely surprise it was on this lovely day to find that ""Mad Max Fury Road"" is a fiercely feminist declaration of independence -- purehearted passionate and full of beautifully realized moments of poignancy. Yes its as bad-ass as youve heard powerful yet fluid gritty yet crisp sublime in the daring originality of its action sequences and flat-out gorgeous to watch. Just when you think that Miller as director and co-writer has topped himself with a grand and gripping set piece he goes even more gloriously over the top with the next. Believe all the hype This movie will melt your face off. See it on the biggest screen you can possibly find with the best possible sound because this is a complete sensory experience. Theres one image that was so vividly gnarly it made me jump out of my seat and grab the shoulder of the friend sitting next to me. (Sorry Amy.) And yet it conveys an underlying humanity in exquisite and convincing ways. Perhaps this stands out even more because it exists in such an outlandish wasteland. ""Mad Max Fury Road"" is a movie in which men initially seem to dominate but eventually it reveals that its truly about strong women fighting for each other fighting for survival fighting for the future. Hardy as Max becomes a passenger both literally and figuratively. This is truly Charlize Therons film. As the fearless and unflappable Imperator Furiosa Theron has given us a supreme action heroine for the ages. With her shaved head greased face a steampunk-inspired mechanical arm and an endless arsenal within the war rig she drives shes an intimidating and resourceful protector. Theron has shirked her gorgeous looks previously (in her Oscar-winning performance in ""Monster"") and shes dared to play truly unlikable characters (in ""Young Adult"" and ""Snow White and the Huntsman""). Here theres a beauty to her ferocity a regalness to her statuesque demeanor and -- ultimately -- a tenderness and vulnerability which are heartbreaking. Its no hyperbole to say shes right up there with Sigourney Weaver in the ""Alien"" franchise and Linda Hamilton in the ""Terminator"" films. Although the film is told from Maxs perspective in the script from Miller Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris Furiosa is the one whos truly driving the story in myriad ways. This isnt really a sequel to the three previous movies -- the low-budget ""Mad Max"" (1979) the hugely influential ""Mad Max 2 The Road Warrior"" (1981) and the Tina Turner-tastic ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" (1985) -- nor is it a remake. You could call it a reboot but that makes it sound reheated. ""Fury Road"" fits squarely within the series mythology but its wildly vibrant and a true original. Former police officer Max Rockatansky is running from his past from both the living and the dead as he says in a low rumbling voiceover. From the first richly oversaturated images of Max surveying the unforgiving desert landscape that lies before him -- Oscar-winner John Seale is responsible for the stunning cinematography -- his sense of isolation is palpable. But this ultimate loner and rebel finds himself an unwitting pawn at the Citadel a fortress carved out of the side of a mountain where the grotesque tyrant Immortan Joe rules completely through a twisted cult of personality. In a neat bit of casting the actor playing Joe is Hugh Keays-Byrne who played the villainous motorcycle gang leader the Toecutter in the original ""Mad Max."" (Hes still creepy as hell all these years later in case you were wondering.) When Joes most trusted driver Therons Furiosa veers off course and goes rogue during a routine run to Gas Town the chase is on and the imprisoned Max is right in the thick of it. Hes strapped to the grill of a car driven by the jacked-up and thoroughly unstable Nux (Nicholas Hoult) a War Boy who foolishly believes his loyalty to the sadistic Joe will land him a spot in Valhalla. Shaved and painted a blinding white like the rest of Joes minions the usually handsome Hoult is a frightening sight to behold. But his appearance also suggests an innocence -- an infancy almost -- which makes him an unexpectedly sympathetic figure. (Lesley Vanderwalt was in charge of the inspired hair and makeup design; meanwhile Oscar-winner and multiple nominee Jenny Beavan provided the artfully rough-hewn costume design which couldnt be farther away from the clothes she made her name on in classic Merchant-Ivory films like ""A Room With a View"" and ""Howards End."") Actually calling what Nux is driving a ""car"" suggests something youve seen before. These are the remnants of society slapped together and souped up for survival in dystopia muscle cars on top of tanks vintage cars on top of oil rigs and things that look like killer porcupines with wheels underneath them. The level of detail is dazzling over and over again and the tactile thrill of practical effects provides great joy and a real connection -- especially during blockbuster season when so much of what we see is the product of glossy CGI. And thats basically the entire plot One big long chase across the desert. What happens along the way is awesome frightening deeply strange and darkly funny but its never less than jaw-dropping and its constantly surprising. A sequence that takes place entirely within a wall of swirling dirt and piercing lighting will leave you breathless; a quieter moment amid barren trees and blue moonlight provides an unshakable melancholy. The score from Tom Holkenborg (a.k.a. Junkie XL) provides just the right tone each time propulsive here introspective there. I dont want to say too much more because I want you to discover the films pleasures and purposes on your own. But I do want to mention these actresses names because they do so much alongside Theron to provide heart amid the muscle Rosie Huntington-Whiteley Zoe Kravitz Riley Keough Abbey Lee and Courtney Eaton. When one of them takes a pair of bolt cutters to the horrific chastity belt thats ensnared her its poetry and rebellion in a single snap -- and a perfect encapsulation of the movie as a whole.

Thanks Reply May 18 2015  by  Francis     Did you see it yet? Were you bored? Are you sorry you wasted your time and  on it? Those were the reactions of me and the people I went with to see this movie. This movie makes me never want to go to the movies again. Its that bad. Reply May 19 2015  by  Someguy     My my I bet parties with you and your friends must be a hoot. Reply May 19 2015  by  Thaila     I loved every seconds of it. Reply May 19 2015  by  juno     I saw it twice...its gr8 Reply May 19 2015  by  kevin     Dont waste your time. Why call it mad max and have nothing more than a character thats vaguely mad max like involved? I read good reviews and believed them...never again. The glaring overriding truth about this movie is that it tricks people into believing they are going to see a movie and are instead watching ill conceived political thoughts. Reply May 16 2015  by  Jon     Great review Just for curiosity which scene was it that made you jump out of your seat? How about the Vuvalini too on their bikes with their sharpshooting skills? Youre right though that Furiosa ranks right up there with Ellen Ripley Why cant filmmakers produce more heroines of that caliber? Theron was neither token Tamp;A nor a sexy girl power stereotype. She traded punches with Hardy as a true equal where most heroines are content to throw some high kicks at a few minions before engaging in a real fight with a female villain. Ultimately she is the kind of female protagonist other filmmakers need to shoot for where audiences will see her kicking ass and not even take into account her gender - much like how male actions stars are treated. When I watch Die Hard Id never say ""Look at that male Bruce Willis kicking ass"" I similarly watched Fury Road never thinking to myself ""Look at that female Charlize Theron kicking ass"" It was so refreshing Most actions movies featuring female characters seem so intent on avoiding any male characters striking them in any way amounting to some odd cinematic chivalry. Fury Road on the other hand let audiences know that Furiosa is a human first and foremost - not a delicate piece of fine china. Reply May 16 2015  by  Christy Lemire     Not to give too much away but Its what happens to someones face in a scene toward the end. Reply May 16 2015  by  Bernhard P     Thank you. This is a very good review touching on all the important aspects of the film including that it has something powerful and beautiful to say. That wasnt an easy thing to do amidst the mind-boggling mayhem and Miller must have known that he needed the right perfumers to pull it off. Reply May 16 2015  by  Otha     Awesome review Saw ""Fury Road"" and you nailed the ""melt your face off"" nature of the film. I was enthralled with the parallels between the people and the vehicles; there was this apocalypse-personified relationship that allowed the audience to see each character as an extension of their vehicle. Surviving the outback apocalypse is difficult for all (alive or metal). Reply May 16 2015  by  Lucas     Must say I agree with the scene that made you jump out of your seat. When it happened I quite had my jaw drop and looked incredulously at my girlfriend to make sure she had seen what I had just seen. Beautiful movie Reply May 16 2015  by  Lucas     Quite literally Reply May 17 2015  by  Francis     This movie was terrible. You have lost all credibility as a critic by giving this movie a positive review. Reply May 17 2015  by  chdjidie     Great review... NOT Would you like to go into more detail on why it was a ""terrible"" movie because you might be the only person stupid enough to type that... Or you havent actually seen the movie Reply May 19 2015  by  tad mcdowell     Count me in as stupid. It was a terrible movie. There was nothing to it. No character development. The plot was nothing to write home about. Too many unanswered questions. I am glad I saw it for free. Will not spend any money on any future installments. Reply May 17 2015  by  Dustin James     Shes lost credibility by agreeing with 98 percent of everyone in her field? I suppose a person loses credibility by disagreeing with you. Enjoy your narcissism. Reply May 17 2015  by  Dave     98% of critics and 93% of audience members gave positive reviews on Rotton Tomatoes. Credibility intact. Reply May 19 2015  by  Sashiel     ""As the review came in each of us in our own way had to form an opinion. It was hard to know who was more crazy me or everyone else."" Difficult Francis Reply May 19 2015  by  juno     You must be kidding....this is best so far this year in this genre... Reply May 17 2015  by  PaulD     Saw MM4 last night and it lives up to all expectations. i am a native of Melbourne Australia where the original Mad Max was made and actually am related to the major investor on the first film. A great facet of the film is its Aussiness many of the cast are local stallwart actors who have been around for ever. Fang it is central to the dialogue. This was a term from70s Melbourne which means drive faster. Great review. Reply May 17 2015  by  Marnie     That ""scene"" is also the only time I really cringed in sheer horror. Strangely enough I didnt find the film to be gruesomely violent - I think some of it was left to your imagination and not all was showed on film. This movie is intense and I feel like the R rating is warranted but I think so much of the rating was earned purely based on what you THINK occurred than was actually transpired on film. Many of the sequences left me breathless because the energy and continuos chase scenes that go on for 10 minutes or more is just crazy - the energy and visuals were a lot to take in. This film is groundbreaking on many levels - I left this film the same way I left the Matrix and 300 just in terms of how different it is there will be a lot of copy cats. I hope the word gets out and WOMEN go see this movie. Reply May 17 2015  by  Donna     I thought the movie was amazing. I never did see any of the originals even though at the time I was a huge Mel Gibson fan. I felt then I wasnt interested in that type of movie. I mainly wanted to see this one only because of Tom Hardy. Christy is right. This movie is plain non stop. I couldnt catch my breath until the very end. I would love to see it again. Reply May 18 2015  by  damian666     Maybe if you would have saw the previous Mad Max films you wouldnt be so impressed with this one. I dont see anything from watching the trailers that brings anything new that I hadnt already seen. The box office numbers werent that impressive even with the hyped up positive critic reviews. How do they give positive reviews for a movie that doesnt have much of a plot and hardly any dialogue? Reply May 18 2015  by  anthony pirtle     Actually an R-rated film making over 100 million on its opening weekend is pretty amazing. Reply May 18 2015  by  Mel     What? Ive been a huge fan of the series for decades and I feel each one has been better than the last. Same goes for my other friends who love the series. I absolutely can not fathom how anyone could seriously like and understand the first 3 but not this one. Miller stays true to his vision this review is spot-on. Reply May 18 2015  by  Jason Cooper     Thank you for singling out the scene within the lightning- and sand-storm. No other critic has mentioned it that Ive seen. This was for me hands down the most sublime bit of filmmaking in the whole movie. Reply May 19 2015  by  Christy Lemire     Jason that whole section is just amazing isnt it? I forgot to mention how much I loved the way it went seamlessly from color to black and white and back again during that part especially in Nuxs car. I seriously need to go see this movie again. Thanks for reading and sharing your thoughts Reply May 19 2015  by  Graham     Im a big fan of the original trilogy and what Miller has done with Fury Road is combined the crazy car chase action of The Road Warrior with the more introspective tone of Beyond Thunderdome. But hes also upped the intensity all the way up to eleven. This is insanely brilliant filmaking which stands out like an oasis in the desert of dry sterile and mundane action flicks that constitute the genre these days. Reply Pingback Tishe edesh. Pochemu <<Bezumnyi Maks>> - pervyi nominant na <<Oskar>> May 19 2015  by  juno     Simply Awesome Reply May 20 2015  by  Krishna     Christy Thanks for writing this review. I missed your review on this movie on What The Flick. May be you Ben Matt and Alonso can get together once again on What The Flick to review this movie as it is worth it. This movie was a cinematic rock music opera on steroids like it has never been done before. I would strongly recommend everyone to watch it on the biggest screen possible. After the end of the first major action sequence I even forgot I was in a movie theater or I was hyperventilating. One thing this movie does is it slows down the action sequences enough times to give you a stunning visual of the world it is set in and to not to give you battle fatigue and not bore you with mindless action like most movies does like the recent Furious 7 and Avengers. Cant wait to see it again. Reply May 20 2015  by  Christy Lemire     Thanks Krishna Id like to have a chance to review it too. Had a sick kid at home last week and then caught whatever he had. But Im sure Ben would enjoy talking about Mad Max too so maybe we can find a way to revisit it. Reply May 20 2015  by  Jesus Saldivia     I truly admire you for this review. I hope one day i can write like you. Congrats Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

That gives me happy feet. 1.2k Shares Share 1.2k Tweet 37 Share 6 Share Email Print Share Tom Hardy in Mad Max Fury Road. Photo Warner Brothers If youve relished theA Mad MaxA series your heart will leap inA Mad Max Fury RoadA the first time a ""War Rig"" made of leftover car and truck frames (human skulls affixed to the grille) or a turbo-charged weaponized jeep swerves into the foreground and then suddenly roars off into the distance at a 45-degree angle while the camera continues on its scorching horizontal track. Its a signature move by director George Miller who gets scary-close (hes fucking with us) and then says ""Eat my dust."" That dust tastes damn good. The majority of sequels have no reason for being apart from sequel money but watching this fourth Mad MaxA I could sense after roughly .0001 seconds that the 70-year-old Aussie director has been revving his engines for a long long time itching to get back to the blacktop and deliver even wilder automotive mayhem. After all his last two films Happy Feet and Happy Feet 2 centered on animated dancing penguins. He has some serious punk cred to restore. As you no doubt know from all the buzz most critics think Miller has his cred back and then some and theyve given him a heros welcome. That gives me happy feet. The man made Max Max The Road Warrior Lorenzos Oil and especially Babe Pig in the City which is like Charlottes Web retold by Dickens. (As a sequel a box-office megabomb and a film starring a pig it has never gotten its due.) And Mad Max Fury Road is certainly a blast and a half You dont just watch it you rock out to it. How satisfied youll be after all the ""wow""s and ""whew""s will depend on how fine you are with a film that starts in the middle of the story and is basically a long chase. I saw it twice and liked it vastly more the second time around when Id adjusted my expectations and had my bearings from the get-go. Then it became about digging the spectacle -- not to mention the hilarious sexual politics. This is not it should be said a ""reboot."" Its the same Mad Max post-Thunderdome though now played by Tom Hardy Mel Gibson having been judged too old and more important too genuinely mad to continue in the series that launched him to stardom 36 years ago. ""My world is fire and blood"" says Max in voice-over standing on a cliff at one with the poisoned postapocalyptic wasteland his face hidden by a swarm of filthy hair. He stomps a big boot down on a scurrying lizard snatches it up and shoves it in his mouth crunch. A blizzard of images evokes his inner life bombs bodies the killing of his wife and child. The little girl calls to him in visions which is strange because I remember his child being (a) a toddler and (b) a boy -- but it was a long time and many bodies ago and I might be wrong. Or maybe shes not his child but a sort of emissary from the world of child spirits. Miller does a cool stroboscopic fun-house effect with the little girls face -- now flesh now bone now flesh again. Max wants like mad to be emotionally dead numb to the carnage but this moppet keeps jolting him back to life. The prologue in which Max is chased captured tattooed branded and put in a cage by raiders from a towering citadel is stunningly well done -- particularly if you see the film in 3-D which Miller uses like a macabre ringmaster chucking arrows bones and parts of cars and bodies at you. This citadel -- known far and wide as ""the Citadel"" -- is presided over by Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) a sickeningly disfigured tyrant who stands high above his sheeple promising them immortal life in the corridors of Valhalla while taunting them for their dependence. (He makes them beg for water.) Actually everyone in the Citadel is sickeningly disfigured emaciated or studded with tumors from living in a radioactive landscape. But Immortan Joe takes the uranium cake. His flesh is mottled and covered with ... yecchy stuff. In a steel mask notable for its Neanderthal set of choppers he looks like a walking shrunken head topped with a white fright wig. This is all awesome but I actually had a hard time getting past my awe and into the movie. Max isnt just emotionally remote. Hes matted with dirt and kept in shadow. Hes chained to the front of a truck everything below his eyes concealed by a steel face-cage. Its mighty peculiar that here as in The Dark Knight Rises an actor with maybe the most fascinating visage in movies spends so much time behind a mask. You do get a lot from those eyes which signal sadness and desperation. But the lips are where its at. Theyre not just fashionably pillowy. Theyre neo-Brando blubbery. They signal a swelling an excess of emotion. They make you understand why the sounds that come out of his mouth are not always recognizable as English What words could do justice to that much feeling? Casting Hardy as a man who shrouds his emotions and then covering his face is just ... mad. Half an hour into Mad Max Fury Road I felt as if the nominal hero and I hadnt been properly introduced. There is of course another hero. Heroine. The story proper kicks off when Immortan Joes top raider -- Furiosa played by Charlize Theron with a shaved head and one steel arm -- sets off on a mission in a ramshackle War Rig before suddenly changing course. Joe checks on his breeders but theyre gone. He screams to Heaven and orders up his army. The chase is on Wait. Who is Furiosa? (She has barely said a word.) Who -- or what -- are the breeders? Who is the old woman shrieking at Immortan Joe? By now its clear that Millers strategy is to throw you into the tumultuous action and only later show you whats at stake and why you should care. He thinks hes cunningly withholding major details to keep you guessing but there isnt enough information to guess from before he well cuts to the chase. Its backwards storytelling. Call me bourgeois but I like a little more context for my mayhem which is why I was more involved the second time when I knew Furiosa knew the breeders and knew a bit more about why Max was on the front of a truck connected by an IV line to a skinny bald guy with a white face and blackened eye sockets -- who looks on first (and second) glance exactly like the hundred other skinny bald guys with white faces and blackened eye sockets but turns out to be a major character called Nux (Nicholas Hoult). Mad Max Fury Road wakes up dramatically speaking when Max and Furiosa meet with (rousingly staged) fisticuffs at first but soon with more affection. Slightly more anyway. Both their hearts having been tanned into leather by tragedy theyre wary of connection and Furiosa isnt too trusting of men to begin with. Its an extraordinary performance by Theron who barely emotes but whose hardness is broken by glints of guilt and grief. Its a mighty moment when given terrible news she staggers towards a titanic sand dune -- it rises from nowhere but nothing less would be worthy of her -- and sinks to her knees in despair. At time like that you might wish the film had been called Mad Maxine and had followed her from the start. Its a woman-centric movie. Furiosa is fleeing across the vast wasteland in search of a matriarchal oasis she calls the ""green place of many mothers."" And those breeders turn out to be a pampered harem of willowy model types (one brown-haired one white-blonde one redhead one tall and black-haired one smaller and more racially exotic) tasked with bearing Immortan Joe healthy children. Why a group of women so skinny they look as if theyd pitch off the side of a runway from lack of food should be so evolutionarily desirable in a time of sickness and starvation is a mystery -- but not really much of one given the high level of wowza on display. Maybe the best visual joke in the movie is when Max staggers out of the desert and beholds them for the first time shimmering in the heat Rosie Huntington-Whiteley Zoe Kravitz Abbey Lee Courtney Eaton and Riley Keough in skimpy shorty filmy dresses hosing one another off in lyrical semi-slow motion. Mad Max Fury Road is actually full of brilliant visual jokes its desert a mythic stage for a punk-rococo circus of freaks. Behold the great pile of steering wheels on which the bald warriors descend each man bearing his own away with reverence as if its Excalibur. Theres a little tree in the middle of the desert that looks like its waiting for Vladimir and Estragon. The sight of a half dozen or so bongo drummers on the back of a War Rig is a marvelous setup for the revelation of the masked heavy-metal rocker guitarist tied to the front his instrument belching flames at moments of peak bloodlust. (The authors of Dogme 95 would be pleased Miller has incorporated his musicians into the action.) In the climactic high-speed road battle warriors on long poles bend in and out of the frame throwing bombs and snatching up women Its as if youd smoked weed and started watching an old Western and suddenly the stagecoach turned into a truck full of supermodels and the charging Injuns vampire acrobats. The knowledge that the vampire acrobats are mostly real stuntmen moving really really fast instead of 1s and 0s in a computer adds exponentially to the WTF quotient. Miller clearly felt he needed to raise the stakes -- to top himself -- in Mad Max Fury Road and the road fury is indeed packed with multiple crazy-funny variables. But at the end of the road I have to admit that I prefer the cleaner sharper climax of The Road Warrior which has no CGI whatsoever. You lose things in the clutter. That said Miller has a trick up his sleeve that he didnt three decades ago grannies on motorcycles. It turns out that what compelled him to make this fourth Mad Max was the notion of a nurturing matriarchal society far removed from the grotesque sadism of male-warrior culture. The gorgeously weatherbeaten old women who roar out of the wasteland to greet Furiosa and Company tolerate Max and show some affection for Nux -- the bald mortally ill white-painted War Boy who longed to die in battle but was so lovably clumsy that he wound up on the side of the girls. But these tough old birds dont want or need men those disease-carrying homicidal brats who turned a world that was once a garden into a nuclear wasteland. Also the old ladies gaze on those cute little models as if it would be really nice to curl up with them under the stars. Its a wonderful joke that so-called mens-rights groups have expressed outrage over Mad Max Fury RoadA -- so wonderful that Id suspect the studio of cooking up the controversy by itself if I didnt know that such morons actually exist. In their eyes Miller has committed an unforgivable sin by appropriating their cultural space to promote femi-Nazism. He has made a movie with more amazing motorcycles than a bikers rally and more high-decibel mash-ups than a monster truck event FUCKIN A AWWRIGHT He has stuffed it with every shape and size of gun imaginable BOO-YAH Then he made a bald chick and a bunch of grannies more potent than an armada of male giants with mighty pecs -- who turn out under all the war paint to be squalling babies with disease-ridden pencil dicks. The final battle takes place in a narrow passage through a canyon that looks suspiciously like a stand-in for the gates of Thermopylae.

Let it roll over you like the wheels of an armor-plated tanker truck full of women fleeing sexual slavery. Because thats what Mad Max Fury Road is built to do.Its been 30 years since director George Miller (or anyone else) made a Mad Max movie and it was easy to view this new sequel/reboot/whatever with a certain amount of drilling-an-old-well skepticism. But skepticism burns away like vapor in the heat of the blazing arid dystopia Miller has created. Fury Road is an A-plus B-movie an action flick so vivid and visceral so striking in conception and extraordinary in execution that it comes almost as a revelation.Related Story The State of 2015s Summer Movies Max Rockatansky--played by Mel Gibson in the original trilogy and by Tom Hardy here--is mad. Hes mad that the world collapsed that thermonuclear conflict led to a bitter Darwinian struggle for scraps and water amid the post-apocalyptic landscape. (The very first scene of the movie finds him stomping a gecko flat then eating it.) But mostly hes mad because he was unable to save his wife and daughter from death at the hands of roving marauders. (Also his dog way back when although that goes unmentioned in this telling.)Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) is--you guessed it--furious. An important lieutenant in the army of brutal warlord Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) she is nonetheless furious that she was long ago plucked from her home to serve. But shes more furious still at Joes enslavement of his ""breeders"" fertile women treated as sexual chattel to bear his babies.So Furiosa steals a heavy ""war rig"" with five such women stowed aboard and begins her trek across a seemingly endless desert. When Immortan Joe assembles his own vehicular posse to hunt her down Max a captive is brought along as a hood ornament and human ""blood bag""--that is an as-needed intravenous plasma transfusion for Joes ghostly ""War Boys."" Max escapes joins Furiosa on her odyssey toward a better future ... And thats pretty much the movie.Fury Road is a remarkably lean film uncluttered by the discursive backstories subplots and hand-wringing moral quandaries that bring so many contemporary action movies to a grinding halt. Dialogue is scant and exposition all but non-existent. There are good guys (most of them technically gals) and bad guys (pretty much all of them physically repellent in one manner or another). The bad guys chase the good guys occasionally catching up with them in time to initiate a set piece of delirious automotive destruction. Its a plot almost as linear as Max and Furiosas journey across the sands.If the narrative is simple however the costume and production design are magnificently baroque the retro-futurist vehicles emblazoned with skulls and tricked-out with spikes or tank treads or cannons. The toothy death-mask respirator worn by Immortan Joe (partly so we dont recognize Keays-Byrne as the same actor who played Toecutter in the original Mad Max). The mascarad shave-pated War Boys huffing chrome spray paint with glee. The creepy stilt-folk who wander silently through a fetid swamp. There are cars that bristle like hedgehogs and bandits who resemble Tusken Raiders dive-bombing motorcyclists and chainsaw-wielding attackers who swoop down Cirque de Soleil-like on the tips of flexible poles. The techno-primitivism is all of a piece This is a world made up entirely of gears and chains and internal combustion engines.Of course a war party as rock-operatic as Immortan Joes needs its own soundtrack and ""Ride of the Valkyries"" is not going to cut it here. Enter the Doof Wagon a monstrous heavy-metal amplifier on wheels--horns speakers kettledrums worthy of the Blue Man Group--and its frontman the Coma-Doof Warrior who hangs from strings like a marionette wielding a two-headed guitar-cum-flamethrower. (Sign me up for the Coma-Doof spinoff.)Fury Road is an A-plus B-movie an action flick so vivid and visceral that it comes almost as a revelation.This all no doubt sounds tremendously silly but Miller deploys his playthings with such visual virtuosity and outright ferocity that Fury Road never plays like a joke inside or otherwise. The picture was shot by the Oscar-winning cinematographer John Seale (The English Patient) who came out of retirement for the project and his eye for quality shows. The action sequences are mesmerizingly choreographed and feature blessedly little overt CGI. (This is the rare movie that is genuinely worth seeing in 3D.) The reliance on stunts and practical effects helps contribute to Fury Roads throwback-y appeal At times the movie feels almost like a tone poem to early-80s excess a cross between a monster-truck rally and a Plasmatics concert.Neither Hardy nor Theron (nor anyone else in the film) delivers a particularly strong performance. But they look their parts and thats ultimately more important. This is not what anyone would plausibly describe as an actors film. (For that try Tom Hardys opposite-end-of-the-spectrum vehicular foray last years understatedly tremendous Locke.) There are also a few missteps along the way--Maxs visions of his dead daughter are a rare unnecessary flourish--and 20 minutes might have been usefully shaved from the two-hour running time.But Mad Max Fury Road is that rarest of indulgences a blockbuster-season release that fully delivers on its promise. This is vital action filmmaking a wash of sensation almost primal in its intensity and utterly devoid of the mopey self-seriousness that is so much in vogue these days. May you stay mad forever Max.

Twitter previousYou Can Now Buy a Bernie Sanders Teddy BearnextThink Twice Before Calling the Cops on the Mentally Ill Most Popular Presented by Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Lucy Nicholson / Reuters Trump Time Capsule 65 Id Like to Hear His Wife Say Something James Fallows None The most personally moving and most fundamentally patriotic moment of the Democratic National Convention was the appearance by the bereaved parents of Army Captain Humayun Khan and the statement about the meaning of their sons life and death and about the Constitution by Mr. Khizr Khan. After Khizr Khan spoke politicians and commentators on most networks said they were moved humbled inspired choked up. (Commentators on Fox did not say these things because their coverage cut away from the Khans for Brit Hume and Megyn Kelly plus a Benghazi ad.) Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics. Continue Reading Tom Pennington / Getty Images The Mind of Donald Trump Dan P. McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Gary Cameron / Reuters Trump Time Capsule 62 A Man Who Can Be Baited With a Tweet James Fallows None Last night in her overall very successful acceptance speech Hillary Clinton said with ruthless precision about her opponent Ask yourself Does Donald Trump have the temperament to be Commander-in-Chief? Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

As Hurricane Katrina raged through New Orleans in 2005 neighborhood after neighborhood collapsed from flooding. Of the houses that stood many still had to be bulldozed due to mold within the walls. But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed. ""The Pitot house was built the old way with plaster walls"" says Steve Mouzon an architect who helped rebuild the city after the hurricane. ""When the flood came the museum moved the furniture upstairs. Afterwards they simply hosed the walls--no harm done."" The other houses werent built the old way. ""All the homes around the Pitot house were lost because they were built with drywall"" says Mouzon.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

AUDIE CORNISH HOST ""Mad Max"" ""Road Warrior"" ""Beyond Thunderdome."" With those three pictures filmmaker George Miller gave moviegoers in the 1980s a glimpse of a post-apocalyptic future - bone dry violent and populated by biker gangs gone ballistic. Then he spent 30 years making really sweet movies like ""Babe Pig In The City"" and ""Happy Feet."" Well now Miller has returned to his roots with a reboot ""Mad Max Fury Road."" And our critic Bob Mondello sounds like he couldnt be happier about it. BOB MONDELLO BYLINE Theres a quiet moment at the very beginning Max staring at a desolate landscape as his voiceover tells us how we got here - gas wars nuclear wars the end of Maxs family pretty much the end of civilization. Savor the quiet while you can. A few seconds later Max will be pursued by a plague of white painted war boys from a citadel run by Immortan Joe a gang leader tricked-out in biker drag and a face mask that makes him look like hes half-swallowed a motorcycle. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM ""MAD MAX FURY ROAD"") HUGH KEAYS-BYRNE (As Immortan Joe) It is by my hand you will rise. MONDELLO Joe withholds water to keep his followers enslaved but he needs gasoline so he dispatches a tanker truck driven by Imperator Furiosa a gladiator with a mechanical arm. What Joe doesnt know is that shes stolen his harem. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM ""MAD MAX FURY ROAD"") KEAYS-BYRNE (As Immortan Joe) I want them back. Theyre my property. MONDELLO So from there on the movie is pretty much a two-hour dash for freedom - folks roaring away other folks roaring after them. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM ""MAD MAX FURY ROAD"") CHARLIZE THERON (As Imperator Furiosa) Go. MONDELLO Furiosa played by Charlize Theron with the requisite furiosity more or less owns ""Fury Road"" but she lets Tom Hardys Max and Nick Hoults war boy tag along. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM ""MAD MAX FURY ROAD"") NICK HOULT (As Nux) What a lovely day. MONDELLO Director George Miller gives them the face time and gives the folks chasing them the cool rides - Jeeps that look like porcupines what appears to be a 59 Cadillac mounting another 59 Cadillac mounting a monster truck. Also a rig with an electric guitarist strapped to the front the guitar belching fire. All of them plus aboriginal motorcyclists racing across a Namibian desert that sometimes looks like it belongs in a John Ford Western other times in an oil painting by J.M.W Turner of hell all to get to what Furiosa calls the green place green being so unfamiliar in this dystopian future that one characters never learned the word tree. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM ""MAD MAX FURY ROAD"") TOM HARDY (As Max) How do you know this place even exists? THERON (As Imperator Furiosa) I was born there. HARDY (As Max) So whyd you leave? THERON (As Imperator Furiosa) I didnt. I was taken as a child - stolen. MONDELLO This conversation represents a rare pause in the action that lets you breathe which is good and that lets you ponder the logic of the ""Mad Max"" universe which is less good - a world where water is precious and gorgeous women splash around with a hose in the desert where gas is treasured and everyone drives souped-up muscle cars that on a good day might get a few hundred feet to the gallon. Not that any of that really matters with Miller cranking up giddy high-octane stunts for performers and real rigs rather than computer effects. Those pole riders swaying high above the action - hired from Cirque du Soleil dont you know - there to help make ""Fury Road"" a gorgeous scrap metal demolition derby of a popcorn picture. ""Furious 7"" is just lucky it opened last month. Im Bob Mondello. Copyright (c) 2015 NPR. All rights reserved.

By Anthony Lane George Millers new film gathers up all that we seem to crave right now from our movies and yanks it to the limit.   Credit Illustration by Chris B. Murray There is a moment in ""Mad Max Fury Road"" when Max (Tom Hardy) washes blood off his face. This is unsurprising since he has just engaged in one of many fights but two points are worthy of note. First the blood is not his. Second he washes it off not with water but with mothers milk siphoned from a gas tanker. And there in one image you have George Millers film--wild and unrelenting but also possessed of the outlandish poetry laced with hints of humor that rises to the surface when the world is all churned up. The movie is set in the near future. There are no cities or civilizations left. The landscape is dying of thirst; water--known as Aqua Cola--is severely rationed; and other resources notably gasoline are hoarded and tussled over like scraps of food. Max is a survivor like everyone else and as we join the stream of action he is captured and hauled into servitude at the Citadel. Girded with towers of rock this is the desert stronghold of Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) a monstrous figure who lords it over a swarm of ragged wretches. His toadlike skin is caged in a transparent breastplate and he breathes through a mask thats armed with yellowing horses teeth and fed by bellows that wheeze up and down on the back of his neck. Probably a charming fellow once you get to know him. Max being Max tries to escape only to be grabbed once more and strapped to the front of a vehicle like a fender of flesh with his sturdy features barred by a metal grille. Tom Hardy fans who struggled so intently to understand him when he played Bane in ""The Dark Knight Rises"" may be less than thrilled to learn that their heros speech is yet again impeded. Just as youre wondering if the poor guy will ever express himself freely however Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) a new acquaintance of Maxs asks ""You want that thing off your face?"" The day is saved though its not as if he starts chatting away like Cary Grant in ""His Girl Friday."" You could tattoo the entirety of Maxs dialogue onto his biceps. One of his longest lines is ""Hope is a mistake."" Furiosa has a prosthetic arm and her tendency to smear black grease across her brow may cause the fragrance honchos at Dior where Theron is paid to spread the word about JAdore to reach for their atomizers. Furiosa is a driver employed by Joes henchmen to transport precious fuel who suddenly goes rogue steering the War Rig her vast and snarling truck off course. A posse is dispatched to hunt her down. We soon discover her concealed cargo--the Wives five young women who were imprisoned by Immortan Joe and doomed to bear his children. Our first glimpse of them bodes ill limber beauties draped in muslin underwear and hosing themselves down in the middle of nowhere. Its like the start of a Playboy shoot. Yet the film not only recovers but winds up as a testament to female resilience thanks to the Vuvalini--a small and leathery tribe of matriarchs described by the films production designer as ""lovely old bikie chicks."" Astride belching motorcycles they hare up and down sand dunes and accompany Max Furiosa and the Wives on the final leg of the plot. I have been looking forward to this movie for months trying not to watch the trailers more than twice a day but fool that I am I hadnt foreseen its feminist ambitions--crystallized in the sight of one Wife heavily pregnant flinging wide the door of the War Rig and flaunting her belly like a bronze shield at her enraged pursuers. (The Wives were coached in preparation for the film by Eve Ensler the author of ""The Vagina Monologues."" This must be a first. Gloria Steinem was never hired as a consultant on ""The Dirty Dozen."") Later comes a droll sequence with a snipers rifle as our hero aims at a searchlight in the distant gloom but misses. Only one bullet remains. Furiosa takes the gun and hits the target using Maxs shoulder as a rest. The tough guy is nothing but a cushion. We have met Max before. He first appeared in ""Mad Max"" (1979) as a youthful cop bent on revenge after a murderous attack on his wife and child. His outfit like his automobile was of battered black. He returned in similar guise in ""The Road Warrior"" (1981) and ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" (1985) opposite a resplendent Tina Turner. All three films were directed by George Miller (he had a co-director on the third) and they have acquired the burnish of a cult. Beware of cult flicks though whose reputation sits uneasily on little more than a look; how often did the restive kids who papered their walls with stills of ""Easy Rider"" or of Brando in ""The Wild One"" sit through the actual movie? The earlier ""Mad Max"" films it pains me to report have not weathered well; they seem overacted and overscored chuckling at nastiness and held together mainly by the presence of Mel Gibson in the title role. You watched him as you would a live grenade. The good news is that ""Mad Max Fury Road"" exists in a different league. It lies way way beyond Thunderdome and marks one of the few occasions on which a late sequel outdoes what came before. Is it a sequel though? There are flashbacks to Maxs past but they are over in seconds and you can certainly relish the new film in all its lunatic majesty without being versed in Maxist dialectics. Indeed it exults in a proud indifference to backstory. Furiosa mentions her origins explaining that she was snatched away from ""a green place"" but thats it. As for Max Hardy is more earthed than Gibson and less wired--indeed less mad propelled not by the engine of wrath but by a solid response to the madness that engulfs the characters like a sandstorm. Maxs deeds rarely strike us as gratuitous. Instead they seem resignedly brutal as if there were no other way to live. Whether his deepest desire is for liberty or simply for a dour solitude I cant decide but I loved the coolness with which having taken command in battle he melts away once its over into the shifting throng. That wonderful image allows Miller to draw back and survey the scene from on high. Such is the root of his near-mystical prestige as a creator of action films a bright instinctive sense of when and where to cut from the telling detail to the wider view and back again. Those instincts were there in the first ""Mad Max"" which for all its cheapness picked up rhythm whenever it hit the highway and they are resurgent here. They connect Miller not so much to the panicky despots of the modern blockbuster like Michael Bay as to directors of Hollywood musicals and to the early choreographers of the chase in the wordless days when pictures lived by motion alone. In ""Mad Max Fury Road"" the Polecats--aggressors who arc from one vehicle to another in mid-race on the end of long stakes--are the descendants of Buster Keaton who in ""Three Ages"" fell from a roof through three awnings and clutched at a drainpipe which swung him out into the void and back through an open window. Some things have changed. Millers debt to silent cinema is slightly quelled in the new film by the Doof Warrior who hangs from the front of a truck and thrashes out power chords on his twin-necked guitar which also acts as a flamethrower. Also Keaton meant nobody harm whereas the Polecats are bent on little else as are the War Boys the Bullet Farmer Rictus Erectus and Slit--unfriendly types released from the strange laboratory of Millers brain. One of the Wives is called Toast the Knowing and Nicholas Hoult has a blast as a renegade named Nux who spray-paints his lips silver to supercharge the mood. His dream is to die with honor ""shiny and chrome"" like an exploding machine. All this is such fun and it teeters so close to insanity with a hundred and fifty vehicles at Millers disposal and with a pack of cameras sent into the fracas like baying hounds on a scent that you come out asking Why is this movie not an unholy mess? Partly I think because Miller treats his story line as Max would treat his car--stripping out superfluity and softness in the interest of pure speed. Throw charges of implausibility at the film and they bounce off the hood. Credit must go too to John Seale the director of photography who was cajoled out of retirement for this project and who somehow fills every frame to the brim without spilling. As the War Rig growls through a gully edged with crags of stone Seale unveils the beauty within the peril harking back not just to his own work on ""The English Patient"" but to that of Freddie Young on ""Lawrence of Arabia"" in which a camel bore Peter OToole through a similar pass. Matched against the golden dirt of the desert is the sad nocturnal blue of a swamp where scavengers prowl on stilts and where in an extraordinary spectacle Max wrestles with a lonely tree just as Max von Sydow did in Bergmans ""The Virgin Spring."" No one knows if Millers film will endure as David Leans and Bergmans have done but it must be said that for better or worse ""Mad Max Fury Road"" gathers up all that we seem to crave right now from our movies and yanks it to the limit. For anyone who denied that ""Titus Andronicus"" could ever be mashed up with ""The Cannonball Run"" here is your answer and we are only too happy to follow Nux as he cries ""What a lovely day"" and accelerates into a whirlwind of fire. Enjoy the movie but for Gods sake dont drive home.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

Movies May 15 2015 by Alex Pappademas Facebook Twitter Print J.G. Ballard -- who knew a thing or two about speed wastelands the human death drive and the mortification of flesh by flying auto parts -- once described 1981s The Road Warrior the second of George Millers Mad Max movies as ""punks Sistine Chapel."" Ballard was not as big a fan of 1985s Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome. But even Michelangelo wasnt immune to the impulse to sequelize returning to the Apostolic Palace after nearly 25 years (and the Sack of Rome) to paint The Last Judgment above the chapels altar. It features a buff wrathful Jesus tons of un-fig-leafed full-frontal nudity chaotic composition that rejected all notions of universal hierarchy two-fisted angels clobbering wretched sinners demons dragging the condemned down into hellfire a likeness of one of Michelangelos critics with a snakes jaws clamped on his nuts and a cameo by the artist himself as a face on some flayed skin.

Summer Movies 2015 Rex n FX The Charming Jurassic World How Hollywood Grows New Spielbergs Killing It Spy and Sharing Comedic Wealth; Plus the Masturbatory Entourage Mad Max As Hell The Masterful Maniacal Surprisingly Feminist Fury Road Blah Cappella The Mess and Minor Insult of Pitch Perfect 2 Nerd Plus Ultron There Has to Be More to Avengers Age of Ultron Than Printing More Money All of our summer movie content We live in times of lowered expectation blockbuster-wise; we pretend that not-insulting relaunches of old IP are worthy and that the rare worthy ones are also interesting and necessary. Were lying to ourselves but we do it because theres almost nothing else out there. Fifteen years in the making and right on time Mad Max Fury Road is something else. A respectful and respectable update of the Mad Max mythos would probably still have been received as a much-needed corrective to the unbearable lightness of superhero movies the way even perfectly OK Fast amp; Furious sequels usually are. Instead Miller (who cowrote the script with Brendan McCarthy and Nick Lathouris) spends two nitro-boosted hours gleefully one-upping and two-upping and 10-upping the iconic mayhem of the previous Mad Max films -- and uses all of that hyperkinetic spectacle to deliver a surprising moral payload. When I finally got the chance to take a breath and a few notes after the first big demolition-derby set piece -- this movie doesnt slow down it only relents -- I thought of the cartoonist James Kochalka saying Frank Millers late-career masterpiece Batman The Dark Knight Strikes Again read like the work ""of a teenager who knows in his heart that hes BETTER than Frank Miller and hes ready to take the world by storm."" But lets leave superheroes out of this at least for a minute. I walked out of this movie feeling the way I imagine poet Filippo Tommaso Marinetti1 did when he flipped his Fiat into a ditch in 1908 and emerged with the idea for ""The Futurist Manifesto"" ""When I came up -- torn filthy and stinking -- from under the capsized car I felt the white-hot iron of joy deliciously pass through my heart"" After the briefest of prologues -- societys death throes as montage of heck complete with what sounds like Ronald Reagan muttering ""Mankind has gone rogue"" -- we rejoin the fallen world already in progress. The former Max Rockatansky has grown an Old Testament beard and fled to the desert to be alone with his Thunderdome flashbacks and live on two-headed-lizard meat -- until hes literally pulled back into action by a gang of War Boys paint-huffing chalk-skinned automotive death-cultist mutants who take Max hostage and begin siphoning his ""high-octane crazy blood"" into their own sickly veins. Due to Mel Gibsons age/schedule/lingering radioactivity Max is played this time by Tom Hardy who lacks his predecessors aura of inexpressible guilt and grief but does nail the deadness of Gibsons pan. Fans of the diverse and unique native accents of Tomhardia will be pleased to learn that Hardys interpretation of Australian involves grumbling like a lion whos had James Mason for breakfast and Vin Diesel for lunch. His Steve McQueenish Max is laconic and tough but not particularly vivid which might have been an issue if the movie hadnt provided him with a compelling coprotagonist in Imperator Furiosa a hardened and haunted bionic-woman road warrior played by Charlize Theron with grief and guilt to spare. Miller has lately been fond of quoting Hitchcocks desire to make films so visual the Japanese could enjoy them without reading the subtitles; theres enough going on in Therons raccoon eyes that even sound feels superfluous. Warner Bros. Furiosa drives a huge and hilariously phallic ""war rig"" for Immortan Joe the fiendish albino baron of a water-starved desert city that suggests Frank Herberts Dune as reimagined by Buckethead. (The actor under Joes sinister respirator is Hugh Keays-Byrne who made Max a widower as the biker-gang leader Toecutter in the 1979 original.) When she makes off with the rig during a supply run and heads for the hills Joe and his War Boys follow -- because Furiosa has also liberated five young women from Joes harem of ""wives"" including the pregnant Splendid (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley). Miller finds a clever Road Warrior-inspired way to insert Max into the ensuing chase scene which is every bit as bananas as youve heard -- teenage kamikazes driving the armored jalopies of Ed Roths fever dreams porcupine death-buggies straight out of The Cars That Ate Paris and a fiery sandstorm that shows up in the background of one shot like a photobombing extra before filling up the screen in the next like the pissed-off face of God. Edited with neck-snap precision by Margaret Sixel this whole sequence is breathtaking; I was sure it was the years best action scene until I saw the one in the third act which is a Raiders of the Lost Ark-grade master class in escalating complication. (Two words Pole Boys. Trust me on this.)  A movie that simply did these things this well would have felt like a gift. But Fury Road aims to justify its existence by other means. The key moment comes in the calm after the storm. Max drags himself across the desert still connected by a length of chain and a blood-transfusion tube to an unconscious War Boy and his car door. He spots the wives bathing in radiator water like nymphs at a pond while taking bolt cutters to their chastity belts. Half-wrapped in diaphanous linen they resemble Americas Next Top Model competitors whove somehow escaped Tyras clutches before the makeover episode. You can read the movies politics loud and clear in the fight scene that follows in which Maxs literal blood tie to a foot soldier of the phallocracy becomes both action beat and telling metaphor. Miller came close to shooting a Gibson-led version of Fury Road back in 2001 before 9/11 and the fall of the dollar torpedoed his budget; presumably he cant have anticipated Gamergate making representational parity and misogyny into third-rail issues within the core audience for postapocalyptic action movies any more than he saw Boko Haram coming. But the ""mens rights"" crusaders now gnawing their fedora brims in righteous apoplexy over the thought of Mad Maxs manly iconography being perverted to serve a misandrist agenda arent actually imagining things. This is an unambiguously and unapologetically feminist Bechdel test-passing sci-fi blockbuster that begins Ill say again with Charlize Theron commandeering an 18-wheeled battle-dong in order to free some sex slaves and ends by explicitly linking the liberation of humanity in general to the dismantling (and in some cases dismemberment) of the patriarchy. It asks ""Who killed the world?"" and doesnt front like theres more than one answer. Its most romantic moment involves a woman using a man to steady her rifle. I only wish Miller had given each of the five wives story beats as amazing as their names; the mere fact that Zoe Kravitzs character is a person called ""Toast the Knowing"" is the first thing in the entire history of movies thats made me want to read a prequel in graphic-novel form. Warner Bros. Its worth pointing out that this series has never just been about vehicular manslaughter in a world driven mad by its thirst for gazz-o-lean or in Fury Roads case water. All four movies absolutely belong in the Postapocalyptic Dude-Competence Fantasy section of the video store. But right below that admittedly very skateable surface theyre about a broken man who tries over and over to turn his back on whats left of the world and instead keeps finding himself responsible to and for other people -- a loner whos never alone. Each of the four Max movies is a study of one of the major food groups of human interconnectedness. Mad Max is about husbands and wives. The Road Warrior is basically a Western so its about individuals and communities. Thunderdome is about parents and children. And Fury Road is about women and men -- about objectification and exploitation the self-loathing at the root of misogyny and the question of whether these patterns can ever be broken. ""Where must we go"" a closing epigram asks ""we who wander this wasteland in search of our better selves?"" And maybe Im imagining some of this -- but I didnt imagine the part when Max literally washes away blood with mothers milk. And if thats not enough for you -- or if its way too much -- Fury Road is also one of the best action movies of the decade a punk Last Judgment with manic invention and depraved wit on display in every frame Immortan Joes Frankensteined Coupe de Ville. Joes idiot son Rictus whos essentially a Mad magazine caricature of the Rock. The door gunner who pops up periodically in the window of Furiosas war rig to bark inquiries like a short-order cook sticking his head out of a diner kitchen. The skull-faced Eddie the Head dude -- ""The Doof Warrior"" per IMDb -- riding into battle suspended in front of a truckload of amps while wrestling malevolent riffage from a double-necked ax with attached flamethrower. Furiosa will end up being this movies lasting contribution to the canon and to cosplay. But the Doof Warrior? That guy is this movies soul. Marinetti later aligned with Mussolini and Italian fascism.

By Peter Rainer Film critic May 15 2015 Save for later Saved About video ads About video ads View Caption of ""Mad Max Fury Road"" starring Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron should come with a jokey disclaimer ""No vehicles were harmed during the making of this film."" Probably more autos trucks vans motorcycles and armored cars were harmed in this movie than in any other I can recall. And these vehicles dont look computer-generated either.George Millers fourth installment in the ""Mad Max"" series which began with Mel Gibson in 1979 is certainly the loudest - and thats saying something. In the press notes Miller describes the film as ""somewhere between a wild rock concert and an opera."" The problem with this approach is that Miller ups the amp and floors the pedal for almost the entire movie. Even rock concerts and operas take a breather. ""Fury Road"" is essentially a series of turbo-charged set pieces and the sequences dont really build or top each other. They just pile up.Miller has the dubious distinction of essentially creating the post-apocalyptic action genre and in this film set some 40 years after the fall of the world  he outdoes himself. Civilization has been reduced to a parched rubble. Water is scarce. So apparently are dentists. Ive never seen so many rotting grimaces in one movie. In The Wasteland wild packs of War Boys ruled by Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne sporting a toothy deaths-head face mask) scavenge and terrorize. Huddled starving masses have migrated to The Citadel keening for Aqua Cola (thats water in Millerspeak). Recommended The 50 best movies of all time The War Boys have captured the itinerant Max (Hardy) and enchained him in various contraptions as they and Immortan Joe and his minions hotly pursue Imperator Furiosa (Theron) a renegade warrior who has absconded with the rulers bevy of wives at least one of them visibly pregnant with his child. She is seeking solace for herself and her cargo in the faraway land of her childhood the Green Place. The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide Hardy has his smoldering charisma and Theron often best when shes playing against her glamorous image matches up well with him. The action sequences at least as feats of engineering are mightily impressive. But Miller is so caught up in all his hardcore allegorical hoo-ha that he never lightens up. Does he think maybe hes Homer? Grade B- (Rated R for intense sequences of violence throughout and for disturbing images.)

Fury Road starring Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron feels like the perfect postapocalyptic movie for our own age of energy crises. George Miller comes full circle with Mad Max Fury Road Add to ... Geoff Pevere Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday May 15 2015 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday May 15 2015 1200AM EDT Comments AA Directed by George Miller Written by George Miller Brendan McCarthy Nick Lathouris Starring Tom Hardy Charlize Theron Nicholas Hoult Hugh Keays-Byrne Classification 14A Genre scifi Country Australia/USA Language English A double-barrelled shotgun enema straight to the senses George Millers Mad Max Fury Road is an exercise in relentless pedal-to-the-metal momentum that can only qualify as savagely pleasurable. Its also a return to the now-gridlocked postapocalyptic action-movie terrain mapped by Miller the former upstart wunderkind whos now 70 and returning to automotive mayhem following a long detour into the talking-animal world (Babe Happy Feet) for the first time in three decades. Speaking at CinemaCon Mad Max Fury Road star Tom Hardy recalls his meeting with original Max Mel Gibson while co-star Charlize Theron admits that director George Millers movie isnt too fantastical. (April 23) AP Video Video Video Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron talk Mad Max Fury Road That road being as heavily travelled as it now is Millers reboot is less a means of staking claim to new terrain than trampling the one he first mapped out. (Not to mention an ass-kicking reminder to the punks who followed.)Just as the Australian writer-directors postapocalyptic-punk cartoon chase movie The Road Warrior ripped up the action-movie playbook back in 1981 Fury Road through the sheer reduction of spectacle to a form of sex-with-a-gorilla stimulatory assault lays waste to the landscape and takes no prisoners.Unless of course one values contemplation and reflection as important commodities of the cinematic experience. As scarce and rare here as the water doled out by the hell town clown king Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) to the humans on whom his family of pale-skinned War Boys prey for blood and milk these properties are locked up and rendered pointless almost as quickly as Max (Tom Hardy) is taken prisoner and repurposed as a human intravenous ""blood bag"" and hood ornament in the movies full-on firehose-blast of an opening.But if Millers Road Warrior - itself a retooled follow-up to the drive-in vigilante exploitation of 1979s Mad Max - was as groundbreaking in its thematic and visual conception of a wasted world short on fossil fuels and overloaded on punk attitude style and vehicular aggression Fury Road takes as its crowning challenge topping its predecessors legendary predilection for speed and making it an apocalyptic vanishing point in itself. So this is the way the world ends not with a bang but a monster-truck meltdown.By way of boiling elements down to their liquid-metal essentials Miller - who has had this project on the back burner for decades - also reduces plot to the barest of established Mad Maxian minimalisms. Once again cast in the role of reluctant wasteland wagon-train driver to a community of exploited refugees (in this case Joes handful of breeder ""wives"" led by Charlize Therons road-ready Furiosa) Max is practically a passenger in his own movie. But if even the casting of the comparatively sensitive more overtly conflicted alpha-male-type Hardy marks a minor dip in testosterone levels compared with Mel Gibsons Max the movies primary gesture to progressive political credentials is the motivation for the wall-to-wall autogeddon itself. Making a bid for the womens escape from the patriarchal desert gulag run by Joe Furiosa hightails it for the ""Green Land"" with Max strapped to the chassis and Joes army of revved-up killer yahoos in hopped-up fuel-injected pursuit.Taking up fully more than three-quarters of the movies two-hour running time the chases themselves are showcases for Millers inexhaustible genius for making the most out of what are basically just objects moving through space. Displaying sufficient ingenuity and innovation at high velocity to render almost every previous car-chase movie instantly redundant and enervated by comparison Miller exhibits an almost demonic inspiration when it comes to speed.Opening on the same weekend as Pitch Perfect 2 Mad Max Fury Road is hardly likely to draw much of that movies targeted female constituency across the multiplex corridor but youve got to bless its close-cropped skull for trying. Somewhere beneath all that smoking wreckage is a movie about women taking the wheel and driving their own destiny. While Millers feminist creds will invariably churn up vigorous debate and chatter in certain corners most of Fury Roads constituency will likely be too high on the movies entertainment fumes to be paying much attention.Therein lies this mind-blowing movies only but nevertheless significant flaw not that it will matter much to those whove just had their skulls hosed clean from the experience. As brilliantly articulated as it is from the vibrancy of the visuals to the hot-rod stone-age set design and from the breathtaking precision of the editing to the state of sustained stimulation it miraculously achieves Mad Max Fury Road isnt about much more than momentum the methamphetamine of motor movies.Its true subject is the thrill of the chase and the means by which the movies express it which is to say its one hell of a ride in the same direction taken by the characters deep into a desert of vast and horizonless emptiness.For four movies now Max has sought redemption for his past to realize it only comes fleetingly and always with a catch. So it may well be for Miller who may have beaten all competitors at the game he first invented - but largely by sticking to the rules.

Assuming you like spectacular stunts crazed characters and hair-raising exploits. Director George Miller now 70 returns to the franchise he left behind 30 years ago -- in the interim hes done such wildly different films as ""The Witches of Eastwick"" ""Babe Pig in the City"" and ""Happy Feet"" -- and proves hes lost none of the visual flair and imagination that drove those original films. If anything hes gone more mad.What he has lost is the original Max Mel Gibson but Tom Hardy climbs into the character like he was there all along. This time Max gets a near-equal partner in the fearless Furiosa (Charlize Theron) so this is something of a buddy movie although these are fairly tight-lipped buddies. With some four different outlaw armies attacking them nonstop theres not a lot of time for chit-chat.And heres the thing about those armies and this movie in general -- theyre made up of actual human beings. This is not a movie driven by computerized special effects -- in sharp contrast to say ""Avengers Age of Ultron."" Those are flesh and blood bodies leaping from car to car in the desert shooting off sand dunes on motorcycles balancing high atop poles swinging back and forth attached to speeding trucks.You can literally feel the difference. Its a visceral return to old-school action filmmaking thats so successful it makes you question the wisdom of new-school filmmaking.If you havent seen any of the earlier films no worries. This film stands fine on its own. It opens in a post-apocalyptic Australian Outback desert where Max is captured by a rumbling horde of drivers (car fans are going to want to see this movie just for its wild automotive inventions) and taken to the stronghold of Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne who tracks all the way back to the original 1979 ""Mad Max"").Immortan Joe rules a vast horde of impoverished people controlling their supply of water from a high rock adorned with all sorts of immense Rube Goldberg contraptions and populated by boys hes raised to be warriors. Max is discovered to have a universal blood type so soon hes in a small cage being used for ongoing transfusions most pointedly for a young warrior named Nux (Nicholas Hoult).Meanwhile Imperator Furiosa one of Joes trusted aides is taking a huge war truck out to gather bullets and gasoline. Except she suddenly takes a left turn and starts zooming off to a no mans land. It turns out she has liberated the lithe young beautiful brides of Immortan Joe and hopes to drive them to a promised land.Joe takes his army after her including Nux who has Max chained to the front of his vehicle a bloodline tying the two together. Max eventually escapes and eventually teams up with Furiosa as Joe calls in other allies. And the race is on.And really the race hardly ever stops. Each time you think Miller cant possibly top the last sequence he tops it. This could become numbing and usually does but Miller knows exactly when to pull back on the throttle and when to punch-punch-punch it.Theres no great meaning here -- its a basic story of rebellion and redemption. But theres such energy and visual invention in a world so fully realized and dazzling that the roller coaster ride is more than enough on its own.

Thirty-six years after the original debuted during the height of the 1970s malaise when the future looked bleak and resources were scarce another installment of ""Mad Max"" has arrived subtitled ""Fury Road"" to remind us of two things (1) Things always seem really horrible before they get even worse; and (2) The dystopian future always looks like a desert. In the future there are no flowers. Directed by George Miller who has directed every previous ""Mad Max"" feature the film takes the parched atmosphere of the previous entries and amps it up so that ""Fury Road"" plays out in a nightmare world in which a gang of powder-faced skin-headed thugs control the water and own other human beings. Max (Tom Hardy) is a living blood bank forced to hang upside down with a tube coming out of one of his veins. Other unfortunates include women used for milking women used for breeding and an entire population of filthy toothless peasantry who limp around in rags hold empty bowls and wait for the massive water spigots to turn on. And you thought the life of a movie extra was glamorous. Related Stories Jack Black good in D Train a disturbing comedy Hot Pursuit not worth pursuing Lauren Yees slasher satire is razor-sharp ""Mad Max Fury Road"" has an imaginatively realized world touches of wit and some impressively composed shots. The opening sequence which depicts Maxs capture and enslavement by the evil bald people shows that Miller has been keeping up with how movies are made these days. Its filmed in what looks like very fast stop motion giving it a slightly unreal almost animated effect. In one shot we look at what we think is a long shot of a desert landscape of sand dunes. But then the biggest dune stirs and you realize youve actually been looking at a close-up of a mans head and shoulders covered in sand. John Seales cinematography is playful here -- youd hardly know this is the same man who shot ""The English Patient."" Theres also beauty as in the moonlight scene shot in a purplish black and white. Yet all this wit and effort and occasional beauty is in the service of a movie that is little more than a two-hour chase scene one that seems founded on the assumption that if you show one set of people chasing another thats enough to get an audience excited Oh no lets hope they dont get caught In this case a one-armed woman named Furiosa -- her family named her that before she had reason to be angry about anything -- has rescued a group of young nubile breeders who work for the king and wear flowing white dresses. They are the only people in the movie who look as though theyve taken a shower recently. Mad Max meets the women in the desert and he joins them as they attempt to make their escape across the endless sands of nothingness. And thats really about it. Furiosa Max and the young ladies are fleeing and the kings army is chasing and everything else is a series of variations. They are escaping in a big military truck and sometimes the truck is working well and sometimes it needs repair. There is some welcome unintended comedy as when the women playing the kings five wives attempt to act. They seem at a loss at how to play women who have spent their entire lives in medieval-style slavery but apparently theyd all really be bummed out about it. As Furiosa Charlize Theron is much better investing sincere raw emotion into portraying a woman who started life happy and was captured and abused. Yet in a way the quality of Therons performance almost makes matters worse making the rest of the barren emotional landscape stand out in sharper relief as when she walks into the sand drops to her knees and screams in anguish. She can scream all she likes but she cant scream her way into a better film. Tom Hardy strikes the right balance. Hes a capable actor but he knows the movie hes in. Still for what it is ""Mad Max Fury Road"" isnt bad two hours of action scenes that are well crafted and entirely lacking in suspense and with some clever but fake-looking special effects. Theres a shot in this film that perfectly embodies where action movies are these days The big screen might as well be a computer screen with nothing real or real-looking on it and yet over the soundtrack come the horns. You know those horns the ones heard in all action movies. The sincere horns of truth. The horns of ultimate triumph. The horns that say ""Something grand and important is happening."" But its not. Really its just not. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic. E-mail mlasallesfchronicle.com Twitter MickLaSalle Mad Max Fury Road Action. Starring Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post The rush to christen ""Mad Max Fury Road"" -- director/co-writer George Millers return to a genre he was so instrumental in shaping -- a masterpiece seems hasty. Theres little denying that this hurtling hard-caroming post-apocalyptic movie -- which features Tom Hardy in the title role -- feels like the start of something. Thats a nick as much as it is a promise. ""That was the best action film Ive seen in years"" a filmgoer told his friend after a preview. ""Thats all there was"" the other replied. Which sounded less like a criticism than an succinct observation that ""story"" doesnt gain much traction in this nonstop chase flick. As stunt-rich frenetic action flicks go this reboot of the 1980s franchise is indeed a mouth-agape unrelenting beast of a thing. Its frenzied visions of a post-apocalyptic desiccated world are nearly as mad as its protagonist one-time Aussie cop Max Rockatansky. Hardy takes on the role made monumental by Mel Gibson in the 1979 Australian cult flick ""Mad Max"" and then to more lasting effect in the U.S. update of the saga 1981s ""Mad Max The Road Warrior."" Having made a steady persuasive march toward this star turn Hardy contains a different energy from Gibson. He comes across as more curled in upon himself than manic. So this new ""Mad Max"" is bound to be different too. Still his backstory is set. He is the former cop who lost his wife and their infant to outlaw/death-cult violence and began wandering the dust resisting connection but being drawn into conflict. What ""Fury Road"" forgoes in narrative rhythms it more than makes up for in archetype-teasing themes. It is a stiff cocktail of contemporary (and not) anxieties about war gender death. Men -- Max as the exception -- really are from an angry red planet with little water. A group of female warriors and rough-hewn nurturers are called the Vuvalini. Chief villain Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) is a resource manipulator of the first order. An early scene finds him donning his bizarre snarl mask before addressing the masses below the stone edifice known as the Citadel. Pontificate. Turn on the spigot. Watch the unfortunate clamor and beseech. Turn off the flow. Preach a little more. Water is precious. Gasoline retains its ""Mad Max"" supremacy remaining a commodity worth destroying a planet for. Prior to the renegade tanker driver Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) going so fantastically rogue her destination is Gas Town. Theres also an outpost called Bullet Farm. Blood too has become a premium fluid. Before the film hits its ravaged road Max is kept alive as a transfusion body. A ""blood bag"" is how his serum recipient Nux refers to him. War Boy Nux (Nicholas Hoult) embodies both the vulnerability and lethal disregard of the manboy soldier. Gung-ho he is also expendable to the powers that be. A movie this dark should at least make visible our fitful worries. So its hero -- or heroes -- must be revamped too. Max may be a loner but he is not alone. Theres nothing reluctant about Therons Furiosa. Shes on a mission from the get-go to take the Wives Immortan Joes bevy of imprisoned (quasi-coddled) lovelies to a safe place she remembers from her own riven past. Initially Max is an impediment. She makes him an ally. Word has it that Miller has secured the talents of Hardy for the presumptive sequels. If so hed do well to retain Therons services too. In a sense the director has taken his tale back to its cultish future. ""Fury Road"" is nearly as resistant to story as that first utterly strange Aussie flick was. Few studio films aspire to be operatic. ""Fury Road"" offers violent aria after brutal aria -- sonically and visually. The violence often is so swift and chaotic that we have little time to grasp its impact. Though in some more disquieting way we may feel it. According to Rosie Huntington-Whiteley who plays one of the Wives Miller invited playwright Eve Ensler to the set to coach the actresses in wartime sexual violence. The force behind ""The Vagina Monologues"" Ensler also helped establish the safe village for victims of sexual violence City of Joy in the Congo. Whiteley portrays Immortan Joes most prized vessel the Splendid Angharad. ""Fury Road"" wont be to everyones tastes. Its too cruelly anarchic. And theres a danger its thought-provoking nods to gender theory are likely to get lost in the noise and love of the chase. For instance in a wild update of an image from ""Road Warrior"" Immortan Joe has his own rock-band-of-one violently strumming an electric guitar throughout the chase. Even so theres enough horror remixed here -- of the ""Heart of Darkness"" version -- to engage our current moment. That should be one of the obligations of a reboot. And its almost reason enough to wonder what might happen when Furiosa and Max hit the road again in the near and ugly future.

Close Join the conversation... With Chris Vognar Share This Story Share Discuss Meh Mad Max Fury Road provokes the same question from its audience again and again What can you show me next? The answer is always the same Something even more outlandish and imaginative than what you just saw.George Miller the Australian action wizard responsible for 1979s Mad Max 1981s Road Warrior and 1985s Beyond Thunderdome has upped the ante on his post-apocalyptic steampunk vision. Fury Road is louder bloodier grimier and more relentless than its predecessors. But its never needlessly flashy. It revels in the retro by embracing human stunt work and using CGI as a complement where so many movies of this ilk work the other way around.The barren desert world traversed by Tom Hardys Max and Charlize Therons Furiosa is laden with blood scars chrome dirt and automotive contraptions that might have escaped a sci-fi lowrider convention. (Im particularly fond of the muscle car on tank treads.) It very rarely pauses to catch its breath. Theres just enough dialogue to tell a primal story of survival and rebirth. From left Nicholas Hoult as Nux Courtney Eaton as Fragile Riley Keough as Capable Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa and Abbey Lee Kershaw as Wag in Warner Bros. PicturesA and Village Roadshow PicturesA action adventure film AMad Max Fury Road"" a Warner Bros. Pictures release. Warner Bros. ""I live I die I live again."" Thats the mantra of an ambitious slave (Nicholas Hoult his lips made up to look like a baseball seam without the red). Of course he doesnt really want to die; that would mean missing the next frantic chase.Fury Road does what it does so well that youre quick to cut it slack on the rare occasion when the storytelling gets squishy. Miller is a surrealist who loves to get his hands stained with flesh blood and dust. The movies impromptu medical maneuvers include a merciless Caesarean birth and a high-speed blood transfusion.Millers most vivid imagery is always shot through with organic touches including a warlord whose breathing machine bares real teeth and a slave labor system with elaborate gears and a sheer scale out of Fritz Langs Metropolis. For a movie of such otherworldly visual flourishes Fury Road is remarkably tactile and even old-fashioned in its action execution. The stunt works integrity and jaw-dropping conception would bring a smile to the face of Yakima Canutt the stunt wizard who helped bring the motion to some of John Wayne and John Fords most graceful work. Except these guys arent jumping from stagecoaches to horses. Theyre leaping from monster rigs and firing shotguns as they swing back and forth on giant poles.The story recalls another one of the best action movies in recent years Alfonso CuarA3ns Children of Men. Furiosa enrages chief warlord Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) by absconding with all of his wives who also happen to be his kingdoms breeders. Their destination ""The green place"" where they can start a new civilization and where theyre not forced to harvest their mothers milk. Fertility equals survival. From left Riley Keough as Capable Courtney Eaton as Cheedo the Fragile and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley as The Splendid Angharad in Warner Bros. PicturesA and Village Roadshow PicturesA action adventure film AMad Max Fury Road"" a Warner Bros. Pictures release. Warner Bros. With Theron getting her Sigourney Weaver on (she provides as much of the movies muscle as Hardy) and the storys emphasis on the role of women Fury Road should provide grist for plenty of theses on the feminist action movie.But the best story here is Miller himself the old-school action director coming back to show the youngsters how its done.

Jasin Boland/Warner Bros. hide caption toggle caption Jasin Boland/Warner Bros. Tom Hardy in Mad Max Fury Road. Jasin Boland/Warner Bros. Whats the half-life of a post-apocalyptic action film franchise? Potential ticket-buyers born the day the most recent Mad Max movie was released -- summer 1985 one weekend after Back to the Future -- could be on their second marriages by now. The original Mad Max from 1979 cost less than 1 million in 2015 money. Though an international hit today it plays more like a scrappy curiosity than a great action picture notable for introducing the world to 23-year-old Mel Gibson whose personal dystopian hellscape was still decades off. Its sequel released in these United States as The Road Warrior is the original trios only essential entry. But even that lo-fi high-impact classic now looks like a mere sketch for the long-under-construction Mad Max Fury Road a kinetic hallucinatory boldly feminist chase flick that with its vibrant color palette harrowing stunt work and show-dont-tell style of yarn-spinning leaves every Marvel movie and every Fast amp; Furious in its irradiated dust. Its the most visceral blockbuster since Gravity and it reinvigorates the doomsday genre like no film since The Matrix. Director George Miller plucked-from-retirement cinematographer John Seale and editors Jason Ballantine and Margaret Sixel render its overwhelmingly analog derring-do in a balletic and fluid legato rather than the thudding staccato of a younger more loudmouthed car-chase franchise that lives its life a quarter mile at a time (and never ever shuts up about it). If Fury Road has a moral its the same one screenwriting professors have been reiterating since chase movies starred Steve McQueen Action is character. Words? Theyre just talk. Tom Hardy replacing Gibson as Max with as little explanation as when James Bond swaps faces is nearly as tight-lipped in the role as Gibson was. (Miller co-wrote the script with Nick Lathouris and veteran British comics artist Brendan McCarthy who also contributed to eye-popping design work.) When he does speak he sounds as if hes just snuck up on Vin Diesel during one of his slurry monologues and swallowed him whole. Mercifully brief narration - from Max himself this time a change the earlier movies - sets the table He was a cop in the last days of civilization. After motorbike-riding droogs ran down his wife and child he wandered into the desert. Now hes driven only to survive so he says but here he is again defending the vulnerable against the cruel for a third time. Make that co-defending. Charlize Theron shares a movie-opening title card with Hardy and pulls a Linda Hamilton-in-Terminator 2 elbowing the title character out of the way to become the films true protagonist. She plays Imperator Furiosa a one-armed ""war rig"" jockey who paints her face with engine grease before going into battle on behalf of the water-hoarding warlord Immortan Joe. The McGuffins in his installment are like Soylent Green people Specifically Joes five jealously guarded slave ""wives"" one of whom is carrying his child. Save for Joes son theyre the only humans in the movie not visibly afflicted by cancer or gout or pallor or a missing limb. Except for Max of course - and hes crazier than Don Quixote. (He sees dead people now and its starting to degrade his combat effectiveness.) Anyway Furiosa goes rogue to help these women escape. Wonder of wonders were not subjected to a cinemas-interruptus monologue where she tells us why. We get why. Therons eyes show us why. Max eventually becomes her ally through happenstance not heroism He was a Immortan Joes captive too kept alive for use as a ""blood bag"" for Joes chalk-skinned ""warboys."" In one scene he takes a few errant shots with a rifle before handing it along with the movie over to Furiosa. Her aim proves true. Miller invited Vagina Monologues playwright Eve Ensler to the set in Namibia to help the cast try to understand the perspective of victims of sexual violence in war zones. A tall order for a summer popcorn flick putting it mildly not to mention for a film that for all its brutality sustains a lighter tone than most superhero films of recent vintage. (The sight gags are straight out of a Road Runner cartoon.) But its all of a piece. The feminist and ecological payload of the movie is so inseparable from its simple narrative of flight and pursuit that it never feels didactic. It feels well visionary. Thats also true of the keenly observed anthropological details of the sunny hellscape Miller amp; Co. have created Its a yellow desert with a liquid blue sky wherein sickly warboys spray chrome on their faces in the hope of proving themselves ""shiny"" in battle. An elderly woman carries various seeds on her back her through the wastes in the slender hope of replanting the world. There are a handful of callbacks to the earlier movies - including a running gag about the unreliability of old shotgun shells - but they dont call undue attention to themselves. In a pleasing bit of symmetry the corrupt red-eyed Immortan Joe is played by Hugh Keays-Byrne the same actor who appeared as Toecutter leader of the gang of art-school sadists who killed Maxs family in the 1979 original. Nicholas Hoult gives a terrific performance as Nux a tumor-pocked child soldier who becomes briefly a real boy. And Theron deserves another Oscar. And lets also have one for Miller whos been trying to get this movie made for at least 15 years. After delays ranging from September 11th to the Iraq War to original star Gibsons public dissolution to unexpected rainfall in Australia he finally began shooting... in 2012 which was a while ago. George Lucas James Cameron and Peter Jackson all returned to this sort of epic fantasy/sci-fi after long sabbaticals and all of them seemed to have lost to greater or lesser degrees the storytelling instincts that had served them so faithfully as younger hungrier artists. Not so with Miller whose three-decade second act as a maker of family-friendly films (two installments in the porcine Babe franchise plus two penguine Happy Feet) has only made him a bolder and more energetic maestro of vehicular Thunderdome. Now hes willed into existence a 150 million tentpole that doesnt condescend and feels like the coherent statement of a singular artist. If he can pull that off how about an Imperator Furiosa action figure?

Thats right babies. And in a world where the test tubes have all been smashed if you want babies you need women their wombs their breasts their tender regard for life at its most fragile stage. (""Who killed the world?"" ask the women of Mad Max Fury Road and its a manifestly rhetorical question. Answer men.) The trouble is that as resources go women can be tough to manage. Sometimes they get ideas of their own and light out for a better place. And sometimes they get a little help along the way from a handsome stranger with a tragic past. Director George Miller cant help but indulge himself during his long-delayed return to the franchise that made him and he might have done well to make the dialogue a touch clearer against all those roaring engines. But he also delivers the kind of grueling motorized action that leaves you dazed drained and maybe dazzled relieved only occasionally by bleak verbal assessments of the situation. Its a pitiless primitive primal world hes built -- from its medicine to its religion to its tribal diplomacy -- and its wondrous to behold.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Michael OSullivan May 14 2015 In ""Mad Max Fury Road"" Max (Tom Hardy) is kidnapped by members of a warrior encampment called Citadel and after escaping joins forces with fellow fugitive Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron). (Jasin Boland/Warner Bros. Entertainment) Its less irrational than it sounds that the three scarcest commodities in the post-apocalyptic world envisioned by ""Mad Max Fury Road"" -- gasoline bullets and water -- are expended with an almost lunatic profligacy. Flame-belching vehicles tear across a parched terra-cotta landscape their drivers firing guns like cowboys in a western. When H2O is handed out to a population dying of thirst it comes not in bottles or jugs but as a cataract gushing from giant pipes extending from the top of a desert cliff so that the citizens below are only able to lap at the mist thrown up by the cascading torrent. It is this wastefulness the film suggests that has led to the wasteland that the movie portrays a nightmare world of desperate self-absorption populated by a race of mutants who have been poisoned bodily and spiritually by their own egotistic overindulgence. ""Mad Maxs"" hero -- the titular crazed loner who is shown at the start of the film munching on a two-headed lizard that he has just crushed underfoot -- is described by the narrator as ""a man reduced to a single instinct survive."" To say that there is also a monomania to the film is if anything an understatement. But it is precisely that sense of tunnel vision that makes ""Fury Road"" such a pulse-pounding pleasure. When Max (Tom Hardy) is captured by the members of a warrior encampment known as the Citadel and (at first ineffectually) tries to escape director George Millers camera renders that opening sequence -- in surprisingly effective 3-D -- as though it were playing on 4x fast-forward. For the next two hours the film barely taps the brakes. Whether you are thrown from the vehicle depends entirely on you. Some viewers will never be able to hang on through the storys careening disregard for sense logic or moderation. I advise them not to even try. But if you know whose car youre getting in -- it helps to have seen at least one of Millers three previous ""Mad Max"" films but it is not required -- youre in for one heck of a ride. [Your guide to summer movies] Generally paralleling the chase-themed plot of Millers second ""Mad Max"" film (released in the United States in 1982 as ""The Road Warrior"") ""Fury Road"" tracks an extended vehicular pursuit with Max and several other characters in the lead and a small army of hunters pulling up the rear. Its like a monster-truck motocross competition staged by a more nihilistic version of Cirque du Soleil where the stakes are life and death. It also comes complete with its own heavy metal soundtrack courtesy of an on-camera musician who throughout the chase accompanies the breakneck action on an electric guitar played from a platform mounted on one of the films speeding vehicles. That this rock god periodically shoots fire from the neck of his axe as if it were powered by napalm is of course entirely laughable. Go ahead and guffaw. If youre not capable of appreciating the humor in any of this including the at times over-the-top violence youre in the wrong theater. From director George Miller creator of the ""Mad Max"" franchise comes ""Mad Max Fury Road"" a return to the world of the Road Warrior Max Rockatansky. (Warner Bros. Pictures) In addition to amping up the vehicular mayhem from the earlier ""Mad Max"" canon Millers reboot of the story (co-written with Brendan McCarthy and Nick Lathouris) deviates in one critical and satisfying way from ""The Road Warrior."" Whereas the cargo that Max was transporting in that film was a tanker full of gasoline his freight here is a group of young women who are fleeing servitude as ""breeders"" or child-bearing slaves back in the Citadel. His co-pilot a Citadel fugitive called Furiosa (Charlize Theron) is in every sense Maxs equal. That both characters are psychologically damaged -- Max by the murders of his wife and child seen only in flashback; and Furiosa by having been kidnapped into slavery as a child -- darkens the corners of this already dark tale and deepens Max and Furiosas connection. A third antihero is Nux (Nicholas Hoult) a disillusioned former foot soldier from the Citadel who has switched allegiances having come to doubt his supreme leaders promises of immortality through self-sacrifice. If the character of Nux suggests a disenchanted suicide bomber its surely intentional. Thats underscored by the theme of the Citadels oppression of women and by Hugh Keays-Byrnes portrayal of the Citadels deranged leader known as Immortan Joe as fiery demagogue. Theres an unsubtle -- and welcome -- feminism here in the appearance late in the film of a band of badass older women one of whom known as the Keeper of the Seeds is played by the 78-year-old Melissa Jaffer. She and Theron wonderfully balance out the films high-octane testosterone with a blast of power-nurturing. But dont get too wrapped up in deeper meaning. ""Fury Road"" is less about estrogen than adrenaline. Gorgeously art-directed from the films souped-up unfunny cars to the tribal costumes and make-up to the bleakly breathtaking cinematography of the Namibian desert its a case of style triumphantly squashing substance. Much of it makes little sense such as the Citadels reliance on tanks of breast milk generated by bare-bosomed earthmothers or the scripts frequent references to the Citadels doomed soldiers having ""half-lives"" which can only be extended by transfusions from living ""blood bags"" such as Max. The ""Mad Max"" franchise was never for everyone yet it clearly benefits from fresh blood too. Propelled by Millers nitro-burning aesthetic vision and an entertaining cast this turbo-charged new model is a gas gas gas.    R. At area theaters.

After a pair of successful sequels Mr. Miller devoted himself to other pursuits including two movies about an endearing pig and two animated features about cute penguins.

"Review Mad Max kicks post-apocalyptic extravaganza into overdrive - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Mad Max kicks a post-apocalyptic extravaganza into overdrive Mad Max Fury Road Jasin Boland / Warner Bros. Charlize Theron as Furiosa and Tom Hardy as Max Rockatansky and in Warner Bros. Pictures and Village Roadshow Pictures action adventure movie ""Mad Max Fury Road."" Charlize Theron as Furiosa and Tom Hardy as Max Rockatansky and in Warner Bros. Pictures and Village Roadshow Pictures action adventure movie ""Mad Max Fury Road."" (Jasin Boland / Warner Bros.) Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter ""Mad Max Fury Road"" will leave you speechless which couldnt be more appropriate. Words are not really the point when it comes to dealing with this barn-burner of a post-apocalyptic extravaganza in which sizzling unsettling images are the order of the day.As directed by George Miller in a reanimation of the ""Mad Max/Road Warrior"" franchise he began in 1979 ""Fury Road"" is so action intensive and non-dialogue dependent that it began not with a proper script but with about 3500 storyboard panels detailing an endless string of adrenalized events in a bleak and savage future world where water is king but chaos rules. Costarring the protean Tom Hardy (re-creating the Max Rockatansky character originated by Mel Gibson) and a shaved-headed Charlize Theron ""Fury Road"" is essentially one nonstop two-hour chase with the bad guys in constant hot and heavy pursuit of the few good folks left in this scary derelict and deviant world. If you think that doesnt sound involving you havent been paying attention.The idea explains Miller (credited as screenwriter with comic artist Brendan McCarthy and dramaturg Nico Lathouris) was inspired by ""Alfred Hitchcocks notion about making films that can be watched anywhere in the world without subtitles. ... They take you to a place outside yourself and you come out the other end having had an experience."" Just so. Working with Oscar-winning cinematographer John Seale (who came out of retirement to do this) Miller decided that as much of ""Fury Road"" as possible would be shot without digital effects. With the help of new tools like the Edge Arm system a camera crane that extends more than 20 feet and handles a full range of motion Miller kept multiple physical stunts running at the same time (Guy Norris was the accomplished second unit director and stunt coordinator) and ended up shooting an estimated 480 hours of adrenalized footage. In Fury Road a new Mad Max hurtles into familiar mythology Mark Olsen Mark Olsen Dealing with all of this was Millers longtime collaborator nonpareil editor Margaret Sixel who manages the neat trick of neither lingering too long on any shot or rushing through the inevitably hectic proceedings. Her cutting shows you just what you want to see exactly when you want to see it and its hard to imagine ""Fury Road"" without her expert guidance.The films other heroes are production designer Colin Gibson and his team who came up with an entire derelict and grotesque civilization (with visible tumors and growths chalked up to a poisoned environment) that has been created with unparalleled imagination specificity and craziness. Few films immerse us as completely in their universe as ""Fury Road"" does to often disconcerting effect. Exclusive Darick Robertson draws inspiration from Mad Max Fury RoadOpen link The center of ""Fury Roads"" world is the Citadel a massive fortress built around a complex system for pumping scarce water out of the ground distributed on a random basis to hordes of the dispossessed who cluster around like the masses in a Sebastian Salgado gold-mining photograph. Running this particular show is the aging but all-evil all-the-time warlord Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne the villain in the original ""Mad Max""). With his face only partly visible behind a disturbing intimidating mask Immortan Joe has created an entire mythology around himself and his psychotic army of War Boys who dream of going to an eternal reward in Valhalla if they die in glorious combat in his service.As played by Hardy Max is a man of very few words most of them uttered in an initial voice-over. ""My name is Max my world is fire and blood"" he says telling us as well that he is ""someone who flees from both the living and the dead"" haunted by images of the daughter he could not save as he tries to survive in this most bestial world.""Fury Road"" begins with Max imprisoned and enslaved at the Citadel. An overzealous War Boy named Nux (an effective Nicholas Hoult) uses Max as whats called a blood bag a continuous human blood transfusion system that enables the contaminated Nux to stay alive.One of Immortan Joes top lieutenants at the Citadel is Imperator Furiosa (Theron) a sullen ferocious individual with an elaborate prosthetic arm. Furiosa kicks the plot into gear by ostensibly heading out for supplies in a War Rig a massive 78-foot 18-wheel truck.In reality Furiosa fed up with life under the Immortan is making a break for it and taking with her the leaders prize possessions. Those would be his five wives including Toast the Knowing (Zoe Kravitz) the Splendid Angharad (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) and Capable (Riley Keough) all clothed in diaphanous white cloth like the pulp-fiction archetypes they are.The Immortan of course is determined to get his wives back and he calls on allies with names like the People Eater and the Bullet Farmer. Which is how a staggeringly eclectic flotilla of motorized attack vehicles join in the chase including one carrying the Doof Warrior (Australian singer-songwriter iOTA) a red-clad fury who plays a double-necked electric guitar (which doubles as a flame thrower) to inspire the troops.Set like a human hood ornament on the front of Nuxs vehicle Max is thrust into the heart of the action whether he wants to be or not. It is not long before things transpire to make him and Furiosa wary allies and the chase goes into overdrive.Hardy the villainous Bane in ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is especially good at these feral roles and Theron is his match here. The real star of ""Mad Max Fury Road"" however is filmmaker Miller who dreamed the mighty dream that is this film for more than a decade before being able to bring it to life.

Sean FujiwaraTom Hardy roars through Mad Max Fury Road opening Friday.(Photo Jasin Boland AP)Remakes of classic films are rarely a good idea.But when the original filmmaker upgrades and expands on an idea and uses new technology while retaining the essence of the original story it can be just the ticket for jaded moviegoers.Such is the case with Mad Max Fury Road an operatic extravaganza of thrilling action and nearly non-stop mayhem ( out of four; rated R; opens Friday nationwide).Its exhilarating deranged and exhausting in almost equal measures.George Miller is the mastermind behind the Mad Max franchise and his vision has spawned countless post-apocalyptic imitators. He was exactly the right filmmaker to take on a revamped Max. The 1979 original starred Mel Gibson (as did the pair of sequels that followed in the 80s). This latter day Max played by Tom Hardy has an intensity amid an overall stoicism that Gibson did not project.Hardy is terrific as the titular former lawman/lone wolf character. Hes the rare actor who is equally good in serious dramas low-key character-driven tales and adrenaline-fueled action thrillers. As the haunted Max Rockatansky beset with vivid memories and hallucinations of his traumatic past he is spot-on. Here he is captured by raiders known as War Boys who use Max as a human blood bank. (This is a grisly world where the barely human and near-dead revive themselves with harvested blood and pumped mothers milk.)Max escapes and joins forces with a group of women in a huge tanker truck led by the one-armed driver Furiosa (Charlize Theron). They are fleeing the tyrannized Citadel overseen by terrifying warlord Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) who enslaves the populace and controls the water supply. Mostly the women fleeing the tyrant look unnaturally healthy and gorgeous amid the devastation and freakish near-bestial creatures that fill this universe.The movie is essentially one long relentless chase scene with a succession of battles fought across scorched and barren wasteland. Cars and trucks of all sizes hold menacing drivers and passengers bent on annihilation. The warlords platoon features a death-metal electric guitarist providing cacophonous accompaniment to the tumult. But theyre not big on conversation. Dialogue is minimal.While the extended action sequences are dazzling the film succeeds mostly due to the powerful performances of Hardy and Theron.The best female action hero since Sigourney Weaver in Alien Theron is riveting as the clever and determined shaved-headed Furiosa. She lends the role a fascinating blend of toughness tenderness and gravitas as we learn her tragic back story in the films final third.Miller returns to the franchise -- after films such as Babe and Happy Feet --with a vengeance. Sometimes the vehicular crashes and over-the-top pandemonium grow a bit numbing though Miller finds a way to make even the carnage inventive.Amid all the adrenaline is a strong dose of estrogen. The story has a potent element of female empowerment as women of all ages face off against ridiculously dangerous men and transcend any imposed victimization. Miller dials back Maxs machismo and places Furiosa front and center as a principled icon in a way thats almost subversive in the world of male-driven action thrillers.Not exactly a re-boot and more like a rollicking re-imagining this new Mad Max is grim as expected but also exhilarating high-octane mad fun.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Though determined to wander the post-apocalyptic wasteland alone Mad Max joins Furiosa a fugitive imperator and her band who are all trying to escape a savage warlord.

We missed you in the land of the dark and twisted. The long-incubating Mad Max Fury Road is an R-rated rocket- fueled romper-stomper a nonstop chase epic powered by a reported 150 million budget and Millers indisputable visionary genius. One look at Max and the kiddie fans of Happy Feet would be traumatized for life. Does this ride down Fury Road always make sense? Not really. So what? Just go with it. The great Brit actor Tom Hardy steps in for Gibson as Max and does the role proud. As he tells us in voiceover ""My name is Max. My world is fire."" Gotcha buddy. Haunted by visions of his lost child Max is captured by Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne who also played the villainous Toecutter in the first Mad Max) a wacked-out warlord who controls his subjects by controlling their water supply. Joes elite soldiers the inbred head-shaved war boys smear on white body paint swill breast milk to counteract radiation and enjoy the fanatical fantasy of an erotic afterlife ""I live I die. I live again"" The plot really goes vroom when Joes trusted ally Furiosa (Charlize Theron) a warrior with a mechanical left arm goes rogue and takes off in an armored truck with Joes five breeder wives played by Rosie Huntington-Whiteley Zoe Kravitz Abbey Lee Courtney Eaton and Riley Keough. (Keough is Elvis grandkid - hows that for iconography?) In hot pursuit are the war boys led by Nux (a terrific Nicholas Hoult). The boys lash Max to a speeding car while tapping his arm for a grisly blood transfusion. Exposition has no place in a plot - cooked up by Miller and co-writers Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris - thats rooted in three words Go Go Go That the characters come through so vividly is a tribute to the actors. At first Hardy is stuck behind a mask similar to the muzzle he wore as Bane in The Dark Knight Rises. ""I bet you want that damn thing off your face"" says Furiosa. When she sees him whole Furiosa forms a bond with Max thats all in the eyes. Forget dialogue. Miller does. Hardy and Theron make a dynamite team but this is Therons show. Shes a knockout in a sensational performance that blends grit and gravity and becomes the films bruised heart and soul. The feminist core may surprise fanboys but it lifts the film far above the testosterone herd. Related 50 Best Sci-Fi Movies of the 1970s From cosmic head trips to adventures in galaxies far far away As Furiosa seeks redemption with Max at her side Miller keeps the images coming at you like a meteor shower from a ferocious sandstorm to war boys catapulting from vehicle to vehicle and the scalding sight of a dude shredding his guitar as the world burns. Miller downplays green-screens and digital effects. He wants it real. The stunt work is state-of-the-art as bodies and vehicles collide against a tangible landscape. The film was mostly shot in Africas Namib Desert by the gifted John Seale (The Perfect Storm The English Patient) 72. Miller coaxed Seale out of retirement for the occasion. And what a rare occasion it is with award-caliber contributions from editor Margaret Sixel Millers wife to the wondrous witty costumes of Jenny Bevin and the tumultuous score by Dutch master Junkie XL.

And for a change the ads wont be unforgivable fibs. This old-school thrill ride leaves a CGI contraption like ""Furious 7"" stalled at the starting line.This is analog filmmaking at its most daring. Director George Miller is as Australian as a boxing kangaroo and his 1979 debut ""Mad Max"" was a landmark of low-budget Down Under cinema. No Hollywood studio would have OKd the crazy pyrotechnics that used humans as cannon balls but half a world away from the regulators Australia had a community of stunt drivers who would risk their lives for a laugh and a lager. A new generation of stunt person steals ""Fury Road"" from its ostensible star. In the role that made Mel Gibson famous Tom Hardy plays Max a mysterious ex-cop who roams the Outback after a global catastrophe has turned the remaining humans into predators. Max is captured by a tribe of desert-sand pirates and taken to their canyon fortress where ageless leader Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) organizes raiding parties to steal vital gasoline.When Joe dispatches one-armed lieutenant Furiosa (the mighty Charlize Theron) to Gas Town she betrays him by smuggling his breeder females in the tanker truck. The whooping war party that pursues the rainbow-hued harem is a spectacle that would give John Ford an inferiority complex with Max as a human hood ornament on one of the spiked and supercharged death-mobiles. The whole movie is essentially a post-apocalyptic cowboys-and-Indians chase with swarms of barrel-chested cut-throats buzzing around atop and beneath the tanker. Max warily joins the gun-slinging Furiosa on the race to the fertile land of her birth along with a crazed warrior called Nux (Nicholas Hoult) who falls for one of the five maidens. But theres no room for sentiment in a landscape where even grandmothers travel as a biker gang. Catapulting over the previous three installments Millers production crew has fashioned a future as distinctive in its way as ""Blade Runner."" The powder-pale minions in the steam-punk citadel are literal cogs in a machinery that squeezes water from the desert. Joe whose face we never see behind a grill (like Hardy wore in ""The Dark Knight Rises"") goes into battle sheathed in a plastic muscle suit festooned with old medallions. The war wagons are hybrids of hot rods and heavy-metal tour buses.Maybe theres a warning sign buried in the sand about a species thats speeding out of control but the chaos is such a gas that ""Mad Max Fury Road"" keeps the message to a minimum.What ""Mad Max Fury Road""  Three and a half stars out of four  Run time 200  Rating R  Content Intense sequences of violence throughout and disturbing images Joe Williams  314-340-8344Film criticjoethecritic on Twitterjoewilliamspost-dispatch.com Tags Charlize Theron Tom Hardy Mad Max Fury Road Mel Gibson George Miller Joe Williams Joe Williams Joe Williams is the film critic for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

"Modernized Mad Max gets a jolt of estrogen review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesModernized Mad Max gets a jolt of estrogen reviewA franchise known for its testosterone appeal finds Furiosa a female road demon is every bit Maxs equal -- and then some -- when the rubber hits the road in George Millers triumphant reboot of his action franchise.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. May 14 2015Mad Max Fury RoadStarring Tom Hardy Charlize Theron Nicholas Holt Hugh Keays-Byrne Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Zoe Kravitz. Directed by George Miller. 120 minutes. Opens Friday at major theatres. RVaroom varoomAny fears that 30 years of waiting for George Millers return to his post-apocalyptic Wasteland of ""fire and blood"" might have been in vain are resoundingly stomped right from the opening engine revs of Mad Max Fury Road.Article Continued BelowThe Aussie writer/directors blockbuster reboot of his 1979-85 action trilogy had its world premiere Thursday at the Cannes Film Festival immediately prior to its wide release Friday in North America.With Tom Hardy assuming the Max Rockatansky title role that made Mel Gibson famous ex-cop turned manic Road Warrior the story shifts into overdrive without a hitch and with a great deal of kinetic energy.Its as smooth and commanding a transition as when Daniel Craig became James Bond a decade ago in Casino Royale bringing a more physical and taciturn presence to a well-known character just as Hardy does with Max.Mad Max Fury Road characters revving up for the franchisess latest installment. Power Howell writes that the franchise now rivals Star Wars for the diversity of its mad characters and war machines.  (Jasin Boland/Warner Bros. Pictures)  And Hardy does it while wearing the iron face mask of a prisoner for the first third of the movie which recalls his ferocious villain Bane Batmans nemesis from The Dark Knight Rises.Everything here amazingly feels like a fresh idea thanks to the addition of Theron in the co-lead role of Furiosa a female road demon who is every bit Maxs equal -- and then some -- when the rubber hits the road the fist hits the head and the bullets hit the bulls-eye.A franchise known for its testosterone appeal suddenly gets a solid jolt of estrogen from Furiosa and other strong female characters a true rarity for a movie like this.Furiosa is also the main plot mover as driver of the War Rig a tanker truck loaded with scarce gas and nitro stolen from Wasteland warlord Immortan Joe a skull-masked creep played by Hugh Keays-Byrne previously seen as the sociopathic villain Toecutter in the original Mad Max.Furiosa is helping five women -- played by Rosie Huntington-Whiteley Riley Keough Zoe Kravitz Abbey Lee Kershaw and Courtney Eaton -- escape the raping clutches of Joe who enslaves ""wives"" as breeders for the male heir he desires. Joe and his skinhead War Boys followers are in hot pursuit and loner Max is forced to ally with Furiosa in the struggle to stay alive in a world where compassion is rarer than water.Thats really all the plot summary you need apart from noting that Nicholas Hoults indefatigable Nux a War Boy with no greater desire than to die and go to the Valhalla that Joe promises his warriors makes for an excellent third main character as his allegiances become complicated.The beauty of the screenplay by Miller and co-writers Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris is so much of the story is told visually like silent cinema and without recourse to whiplash editing or excessive CGI.We learn about the characters and their agendas on the run with barely a moment to process what were seeing cross the brilliant lens of cinematographer John Seale (The English Patient) who came out of retirement to make the golden sands of the films desert locales (shot mainly in Namibia) seem at once both hell and paradise.""Dont breathe"" Furiosa barks to Max at once point as she uses his shoulder to aim her deadly rifle at an advancing threat.The audience needs the opposite command. You could use an on-screen reminder to take the occasional gulp of air.What you dont require is advance viewing of the previous Mad Max films. This one stands entirely on its own although there are many little shout-outs to the past the main one being Hugh Keays-Byrnes return to the franchise as a different villain than his previous Toecutter but one every bit as psychopathic and driven.What you might enjoy as I did is a second viewing just take in all the fascinating characters colors and textures of this thoroughly recreated and revived fantasy world which now rivals Star Wars for the diversity of its mad characters and war machines.Read more about Cannes Film FestivalThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Related links Mad Max Fury Road runs straight through North Texas By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 543pm on Thursday May. 14 2015 Thursday May. 14 2015 Thursday May. 14 2015 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Mad Max Fury Road is really like nothing else out there.With the soul of an art film locked in the body of a 100 million blockbuster its a surreal operatic take on the action movie that makes its direct predecessors -- Mad Max Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome and even the mighty Road Warrior -- seem almost timid by comparison. Its a bold idiosyncratic vision from Australian director George Miller that may alienate as many people as it entertains -- theres only the shred of a back story to hold on to as youre plunged headlong into the action -- but its a visceral invigorating experience.Mel Gibson was the original Max the hero whose life became a nightmare in the first film when his wife and child were run down by a murderous motorcycle gang in an Australia plunged into chaos after the collapse of civilization.Though he brought justice and revenge to Outback evildoers he had become a husk of a man.Thats how we meet the new Max played by Tom Hardy though its unclear exactly where in the franchises timeline these adventures play out. Hes a silent loner barely surviving when hes captured by the local warlord Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) and his tribe of suicidal War Boys including the ambitious Nux (Nicholas Hoult). Their feverish battle cry is ""I live I die I live again""Immortan Joe controls the local water supply and thats the wellspring of his despotic power. Meanwhile one of his most trusted underlings the one-armed Imperiator Furiosa (a fierce Charlize Theron) has treachery in mind. While on what is supposed to be a routine run in a tricked-out truck called the War Rig she is really freeing Immortan Joes enslaved wives hidden in the bowels of the vehicle.After some initial reluctance -- and a phenomenally choreographed fight scene with chains -- Max and Furiosa team up but unlike what might be expected in a different action film theres no flirtation or buddy-movie banter. Theyre both too damaged for that. What follows is fundamentally a two-hour chase movie but thats no insult. Miller stages these scenes with the heart of Evel Knievel and the eye of a painter. As the various desert tribes rush into war with their outlandish vehicles and brutally creative weaponry the film becomes a parade of one astonishing image after another. (Suggestion see it in 2-D not the distracting 3-D.)While its commendable that Miller has brought a blast of estrogen into Maxs testosterone-fueled environment with Furiosa the one nagging criticism is the general lack of racial variety in the directors sun-bleached futureworld. Its mind-boggling that those Australian Aboriginals leading a traditional desert lifestyle seem to have disappeared while their much paler peers -- hurtling through the oven that is the Outback in non-airconditioned metal boxes -- have yet to be felled by heat stroke and skin cancer. (Thats one thing a couple of other recent Aussie post-apocalyptic flicks Wyrmwood and The Rover get right by acknowledging there will be different types of people in the wasteland even if like everyone else theyre mostly evil crazy or zombies.)Still this doesnt totally detract from what Miller has wrought a jittery kinetic propulsive fever dream that makes every other action movie feel like a still life.

Share story By Soren AndersenSpecial to The Seattle Times Sheer pyrotechnic insanity. Were talking ""Mad Max Fury Road"" here. Its been 30 years since the last ""Max"" the regrettable and forgettable ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" -- Lost children? Tina Turner? Lame. But really its been 34 years since the franchises previous peak ""The Road Warrior."" With ""Fury Road"" George Miller who directed all four of the ""Maxes"" and co-wrote this one with Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that after all this time he still has it. ""It"" meaning an all-consuming addiction to demento-extremo stunts and high-octane vehicular mayhem. Movie Review    Mad Max Fury Road with Tom Hardy Charlize Theron Nicholas Hoult Hugh Keays-Byrne. Directed by George Miller from a screenplay by Miller Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris. 120 minutes. Rated R for intense sequences of violence throughout and for disturbing images. Several theaters. Millers style is over-the-top all-of-the-time. Across a hellish landscape of rust-hued desert sands and towering lightning-lit sandstorms in the first of many jaw-dropping chases Miller sends squadrons of bald berserkers driving all manner of much-modified big-wheeled scuffed-up retro hot rods in hot pursuit of a fleeing Max (Tom Hardy taking over the part from Mel Gibson who originated the role). Also on the run in a monster truck from these raging crazies is a shaven-headed one-armed fearsome female road warrior with the fabulous moniker Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron grim-faced with kohl-rimmed eyes). These pursuers are accompanied by a ride-along band of pounding war drummers and a crimson-clad guitarist whose electric ax shoots flames out the neck. Nothing subtle here.

""My world is fire and blood."" Believe him. Civilization has collapsed and the ruins are ruled by a disfigured dictator named the Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne who played the villainous Toecutter in the original 1979 ""Max Max""). Captured chained and slowly drained of blood to fuel the Immortans unnaturally white and diseased young male minions called War Boys (the main one of whom is played by Nicholas Hoult) Max has plenty of reasons to be mad. The long-ago violent deaths of his family which haunt him in flashbacks make him even madder. So when he finally escapes and emerges like some primordial creature out of the desert dust his goal is vengeance which to him will be his only redemption. He joins forces with Furiosa who is seeking redemption as well by rescuing and fleeing with the five young slave wives of the Immortan. Who look like swimsuit models wrapped in diaphanous white garments. These lovelies provide a weird contrast to all the grime and grease but theyre part and parcel of the bizarro extremity of Millers vision and somehow they fit in with everything else. ""Furys"" pace is delirious the stunts are incredible -- such crashes such explosions such a lot of flying bodies -- Hardys performance is a marvel of subdued conviction and Theron brings an impressive gravity to her work as Furiosa. Put it all together and youve got a rousing crowd-pleaser that hits on all fast-revving cylinders.

It is not just Millers clever reboot of his original trilogy from 1979 through 1985. It is not just an adrenaline-charged sexually potent well-acted thriller co-starring Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron as duelling road warriors of the new millennium. On top of that terrific stuff -- all of which will turn this version of Mad Max into a 2015 summer blockbuster that could even rival the box office of the latest Avengers episode -- Fury Road is a savage commentary on contemporary society. The 70-year-old Millers robust script is that smart. It was co-authored with actor-writer Nick Lathouris (who played Grease Rat in the original Mad Max) and comic book artist Brendan McCarthy (who once wrote for the Canadian animation series ReBoot). Together they conjured up Australias angry answer to George Orwells 1984 or Ray Bradburys Fahrenheit 451. In their case the Mad Max co-authors lampoon everyone from new age fascists to suicide warriors brainwashed by terrorists into thinking that their deaths will mean something rapturous and worthy. In the post-apocalyptic world depicted in Fury Road Hardy is the new Max Rockatansky replacing Mel Gibson as the former highway cop who finds himself trying to survive the madness of hooligans scavengers and murderers on the road. The major twist this time is that Theron is his equal and his rival and perhaps his noble partner-in-crime. As a second powerful Road Warrior she gives the new movie its femme fatale power. Therons character Imperator Furiosa has only one complete arm. So she uses a mechanical hand mounted on her stump that turns her into a feminist Terminator ... when the occasion calls for it. The set-up is fairly simple. It is 2060. We find ourselves in a parched landscape devoid of vegetation (Fury Road was photographed in Australia and for most of the outdoor sequences in the gorgeous deserts of Namibia in southern Africa when the original deserts where Mad Max was shot were turned into a verdant paradise after monsoon rains). The territory known as The Wasteland is ruled by a despot named King Immortan Joe (played by Hugh Keays-Byrne who gave us Toecutter in the original Mad Max). Behind his Darth Vader-as-a-clown mask Big Bad Joe rules by controlling the flow of water. His totalitarian regime has given rise to the War Boys -- young men like the wide-eyed white-faced Nux (the wonderful Nicholas Hoult) -- who willingly and routinely die to maintain Joes regime. But things start to unravel and Joe is mightily angry when Imperator Furiosa a trusted lieutenant goes rogue by driving off with a critically important 18-wheeler rig. Worse still she takes Joes five young wives along for the freedom ride. The roster of hotties includes red-headed Riley Keough an American actress and model who happens to be the eldest grandchild of Elvis and Priscilla Presley. Keoughs character known as Capable (because she certainly is) ends up having a complex relationship with Nux even though he first appears to be her enemy in this conflict. Fury Road is essentially one long chase movie done at breakneck speed. As Furiosa rumbles across the desert in the big rig as Max becomes her unwilling accomplice as the Five Wives become the object of everyones desire as secrets and lies are revealed in shattering ways this new Mad Max becomes a hypnotic trance that turns viewers into participants. Of course if you do not like action pictures then you might want to run screaming from the theatre and escape into the nearest Hollywood rom-com. But fans of the original Mad Max series -- especially the first two -- are legion. Fury Road with its sensational photography set design and other technical attributes that bring this fourth Mad Max into the 21st century will only add more legions of fans to the now-legendary franchise.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Diesel and dust blood and fire Mad Max Fury Road runs on all of it flooding its fuel tanks to stay in perpetual motion. Forgive the wordplay but this is the kind of movie that turns even timid drivers into fanatical car nuts. For two breathless hours the vehicular mayhem never lets up. Spiked dune buggies like porcupines on wheels burn rubber and scratch metal. All-terrain gas guzzlers flip through the air their rusty steel frames crunching and combusting upon impact. On the hoods of these speeding war machines ravaged travelers battle with fists pistols and even chainsaws. To single out a favorite image from this flurry of nonstop shock and awe would require committing all of it to memory. But heres one contender a masked musician perched high on a mobile stage serenading his fellow marauders with triumphant power chords. He supplies the appropriate soundtrack for this rock-n-roll apocalypse. Also his guitar is a flamethrower.With Fury Road director George Miller returns to the lawless oil-deprived future of his seminal series for the first time in three decades. It was worth the wait. Each Mad Max film has been bigger and more expensive than the last the scale expanding exponentially from the frugal road rage of the 1979 original to the increasingly elaborate dystopias of The Road Warrior and Beyond Thunderdome. Here the budget races across the nine-digit line and it shows. Some directors dont know what to do with that much money relinquishing control and losing personality in the face of hefty studio investment. Not George Miller. Rather than cede demolition duties to a digital team the filmmaker pours most of his pennies into the lost arts of daredevil stunt work and real pyrotechnics. The result feels like the closest Miller has ever come to getting the noisy spectacular action movie in his head--the Mad Max he could only dream about in his fledgling years--up there on-screen.In the age of Ultron theres something comforting about a franchise free of continuity where no new installment demands homework. Fury Road dispenses with the niceties of expository catch-up getting audiences on its titular escape route as quickly as possible. Most of the film unfolds like one long car chase a feverish pursuit across the vast arid expanses of the Namib Desert (filling in for the Outback). Max is up against another fearsome warlord a bulky despot in a skull mask played--unrecognizably but still notably--by the bad guy from the first movie Hugh Keays-Byrne. Immortan Joe a heavy cut from the same ragged cloth as Lord Humungus rules his desert oasis with an iron fist doling out the water supply to his slave labor in drops and instilling a literal death wish in his army of chalk-white ""war boys."" Hes cruising for a dismembering. For the first time ever the road warrior himself isnt played by Mel Gibson who may now be too crazy even to occupy the role of--in the new movies parlance--""a man reduced to a single instinct survival."" Tom Hardy that handsome bruiser with the low English mutter and the tank-like build makes for a suitable replacement. Introduced snacking on a live lizard in the calm-before-the-storm of the opening scene his Max is meaner terser and more unchained than the charismatic antihero that made Gibson a star. Hes also in some respects a sideline attraction. One of Millers boldest choices is to put Max in the passenger seat of the narrative letting him ride shotgun with a metal-armed Charlize Theron in what may be the best action heroine performance since Sigourney Weaver duked it out with a queen alien. The plot thin by design finds Therons gone-rogue soldier slave Furiosa smuggling the villains harem of ""breeder"" wives onto a souped-up tanker and heading for (literally) greener pastures. Miller is said to have brought Eve Ensler author of The Vagina Monologues in as a consultant on his script. If Fury Road isnt quite a full-blown feminist blockbuster it almost gets there This is a film after all where imprisoned women rebel against an abusive patriarch with designs on their ovaries putting the hurt on his legions of slobbering man-children. Speaking of which the only other vaguely sympathetic male character besides Max is one of those pasty war pawns--a hyperactive glory-obsessed drone played by Nicholas Hoult. Bellowing ""What a day"" as he barrels into an epic sand storm this zealot is a source of sick laughs until Miller locates a strange poignancy in his desire for a glorious death.Max by contrast remains most interesting as a force of pure mythic destruction drifting into the conflict basically by accident. (His survivors guilt expressed through sudden flashes of the loved ones he couldnt save is among the films least compelling ideas.) Likewise Fury Road reaches its most transcendent heights when at maximum velocity considerations of character and theme taking a backseat to an awe-inspiring onslaught of (mostly practical) effects. Millers years in animation seemingly squandering his gifts on those innocuous Happy Feet movies have provided him an almost limitless imagination--the ability to envision such Tex Avery touches as vertical poles that send enemy combatants swaying in and out of battle. At the same time Miller keeps everything physical putting flesh-and-blood humans perilously close to spinning tires and billowing flames. For all the chaos erupting at all times we never lose track of whats going on because its been staged not just with diabolical mischief but also total clarity. What a movie.

""Mad Max Fury Road"" also stars Charlize Theron Zoe Kravitz and Nicholas Hoult. In theaters May 2015. (Credit Warner Bros. Pictures) advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT In a post-apocalyptic world a drifter helps several women escape from a warlord. Rated R (intense sequences of violence throughout and for disturbing images). BOTTOM LINE The first ""Mad Max"" movie in 30 years doesnt disappoint -- its a sonic-speed juggernaut of violence and destruction. CAST Tom Hardy Charlize Theron Nicholas Hoult Zoe Kravitz LENGTH 200 How influential are George Millers ""Mad Max"" movies? Heres one example When disaster struck Bikini Bottom in the recent SpongeBob SquarePants movie the citizens immediately put on bondage gear and began torching their town. Even viewers whove never seen ""Mad Max"" (1979) or its iconic sequel ""The Road Warrior"" (1981) got the joke. Millers post-nuclear punk-rock future is still what we think about when we think about the apocalypse. Nevertheless its been 30 years since we last saw Max Rockatansky the anti-hero originated by Mel Gibson in 1985s ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome."" Today dystopian movies feel routine and our expectations of cinematic spectacle have been heightened by the Disney-Marvel machine. Yet here comes ""Mad Max Fury Road"" with Tom Hardy in the title role and writer-director Miller 70 back at the helm. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? One thing is clear ""Fury Road"" is not your grandfathers action movie. Its a neck-snapping eye-popping fantasia of violence and destruction filmed in supersaturated color with the locomotive energy of a Looney Tunes short. Its overstuffed and not entirely coherent but ""Fury Road"" is also exhilarating inventive hilarious and completely bizarre. The apocalypse has been updated Water not gasoline is the scarcest resource and religious fundamentalism abounds. The warlord Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne of the first ""Mad Max"") keeps a harem of wives to breed War Boys (one is Nux played by a maniacal Nicholas Hoult) who dream only of glorious martyrdom. Into this world drops Hardys Max but hes only here to provide franchise continuity. The real hero is Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa who smuggles out Joes wives (ZoA Kravitz plays the feisty one Toast) in a massive big rig. Therons Furiosa a one-armed warrior who uses motor oil as mascara might as well be Mad Maxine; Hardy sullen and taciturn literally takes the backseat. What follows is essentially the final car chase of ""The Road Warrior"" stretched over two nearly nonstop hours. If Miller is repeating himself he also ups his own ante with outrageous stuntwork (Stephen Bland a former Cirque du Soleil member contributed to the choreography) some gory humor and a newfound cinematic style. Miller may not set the standard for another 30 years but he still does the apocalypse like nobody else.

With Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron.Imperator Furiousa (Charlize Theron) has crossed the warlord Immortan Joe whos out to make her pay in ""Mad Max Fury Road.""(Photo Warner Bros. Pictures)Story Highlights4 stars (out of 5)Miller returns to the world of Max and its madder than ever.Hardy and Theron both are good in intense action roles but Therons story drives the film.""Mad Max Fury Road"" hits the ground running and never lets up in an orgy of automotive action that ought to be exhausting but in the hands of George Miller turns out to be exhilarating.It is insane. In a good way. Whoever said ""Too much is never enough"" made an impression on Miller who uses the phrase as a starting point and blasts off from there.Miller of course directed Mel Gibson in ""Mad Max"" (1979) and ""The Road Warrior"" (1981) the best of the original bunch and co-directed ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" (1985). In those films Max Rockatansky (Gibson) is a former cop who avenges the death of his wife and son at the hands of a biker gang. Later hes a kind of savior for the post-apocalyptic set living in a world in which water and gasoline are scarce and thus valuable even when human life is not.""Fury Road"" retains some of that story but its different -- especially Max now played by Tom Hardy. As the film begins hes on the road mourning the death of his wife and daughter. The latter haunts him in visions wanting to know why he couldnt save them.RELATED 36 years later Toecutter is back as Immortan Joe.Max gets captured and tortured by the minions of Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne who played Toecutter in the original ""Mad Max""). Joe is a monstrous creature wearing some kind of steam-punk breathing device and hoarding water using it to control whats left of the population. Its a nightmarish existence punctuated by mothers milk (really) and horsepower at least whenever Joe sends groups out to retrieve gasoline.Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) leads one of those excursions but things go awry when she goes rogue. She has something of great value to Joe -- five of his wives -- so he and his troops head off in hot pursuit.So does Max sort of -- he is a human blood bag for Nux (Nicholas Hoult) one of the War Boys who serve Joe. They rip through the wasted outback after Furiosa and the chases are ridiculous fun. The vehicles swerve and jump and lift off and crash andMax Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) is a man of few words but many actions. (Photo Warner Bros. Pictures)explode and recover and just go go go. This is as good as action sequences in movies get. Its a visceral experience. You dont just watch this movie you feel it.And the story? Thats in there too moving along at a slower pace constantly in danger of being overwhelmed by the mania. Its sort of like being handed a decent novel while boarding a roller coaster. What did you think of the character development? Uh uh ... hills?This sounds like a major demerit and maybe it should be. But it doesnt play that way because the go-for-broke action is true to the characters This is how they live their lives. Or their half-lives -- thats what the War Boys believe they have. Dying in service to Joe is a glorious sacrifice that will land them in Valhalla or so they believe.Events conspire so that Max and Furiosa wind up as a tentative team. She has a plan in mind but it doesnt work out as conceived so Max offers an alternative. What those plans are doesnt really matter -- they involve driving really fast and shooting at bad guys and crawling around and over and under speeding trucks and buggies and anything else on wheels.Hardy says very little even compared with Gibson in the role. But he commands attention with his actions (and action is the coin of he realm in this world). Theron meanwhile actually has more to do. Its her movie in many ways -- her story is what drives the plot and Max is along for the ride.Its an intriguing shift in the Mad Max universe and a good one. ""Mad Max Fury Road"" stands apart in the usual summer mishmash of remakes and reboots recalling the films that came before but forging its own breakneck path as well.Mad Max Fury Road4 stars (out of 5) Director George Miller.Cast Tom Hardy Charlize Theron Nicholas Hoult.Rating R for intense sequences of violence throughout and for disturbing images.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarionarepublic.com.

"Mad Max Fury Road (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Mad Max Fury Road (R) Director George Millers furious adventure starring Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron lives up to its title. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com5/13/2015 Editor rating 4 With Mad Max Fury Road director George Miller delivers the sort of jumbo-sized entertainment that makes you  break out in appreciative laughter The breadth of his imagination and showmanship leaves you giddy. Miller a former doctor turned filmmaker is 70 and he hasnt directed a live-action movie since 1998. He had been trying to jumpstart Fury Road for more than a decade which helps to explain the ferociousness with which he tears into this material (you can picture him on location in Africas punishing Namib Desert beaming and thinking ""Finally""). At this point Miller doesnt have anything to prove. But the film makes obvious how much he has been wanting to get back to work and he unleashes that pent-up enthusiasm in a two-hour blast of relentless excitement that never becomes tiresome or oppressive. This is a huge yet surprisingly fleet and brisk picture that celebrates the visceral primal pleasures of movies. With the help of John Seale the 72-year-old Oscar-winner who also shot The English Patient and The Talented Mr. Ripley and a magnificent score by Junkie XL which runs the gamut from lush orchestral compositions to throbbing electronica Miller has achieved the sort of movie that is all too rare these days A big-budget summer blockbuster unlike any youve seen before. Fury Road makes AvengersAge of Ultron look like an adorable childs toy (nice try Joss Whedon) and reveals Furious 7 to be the cheap hollow cartoon it always was. The movie has the same jaw-dropping impact as The Road Warrior did in 1982 except this one goes much further because the radical advances in filmmaking (along with that 150 million budget) allow Miller to do things he could only dream about before. Best of all Miller avoids the trap that snares practically every other filmmaker making genre pictures today. Fury Road is filled with computer-generated images and effects but theyre used as embellishments not replacements for the real thing. Almost every car crash and stunt you see on the screen was done live in front of the cameras. There isnt a moment in the movie when youre jarred out of the story by a blatantly fake image not even the part in which an oil rig racing through the desert carrying precious human cargo is hijacked by lunatics (performed by Cirque du Soleil athletes) driving alongside in buggies using poles to vault through the air and land atop the truck. You have to see it to believe it. The filmmaking (including the superb editing by Jason Ballantine and Margaret Sixel who have cut the movie at a thunderous speed without sacrificing clarity or confusing your eye) is the true star of Fury Road but the actors dont fare badly either. Taking over for Mel Gibson who had simply grown too old to reprise one of his signature roles Tom Hardy has little dialogue Max Rockatansky the former cop driven insane whose sole purpose is to survive in a bombed-out post-apocalyptic wasteland isnt much for chit-chat. What the part requires is a great physicality -- an ability to convey emotions and humor and personality through action -- and Hardy turns out to be a natural-born Buster Keaton. Hes able to sell far-fetched stunts as easily as ferocious close-quarters combat but he can go smaller too In a long sequence in which hes tied to the front of a speeding car like a hood ornament an iron muzzle strapped to his head while hes being drained of his blood like a human IV drip Hardy conveys Maxs horror and rage using only his eyes and the bulging veins in his neck. The few times he does speak Hardy gives Max a guttural growl with a vague accent that is hard to pin down He looks (and sounds) like hes lived through thousands of miles of hard road. But one of the best things about Fury Road is that although Max gets the title the spotlight is mostly on Imperator Furiosa (a fantastic Charlize Theron) a female road warrior who has fled a primitive city ruled by a monstrous tyrant (Hugh Keays-Byrne) with five of his fertile ""breeder"" slaves in tow hoping to take them to the ""green place"" she remembers from her childhood a paradise amidst the desert wasteland that is all that remains of our planet. Furiosa is the secret weapon in Fury Road She and her charges (who are all supermodel beautiful yet still register as real dimensional women) are the focus of the sort of story that is almost always dominated by male characters. Despite its fantastical often grotesque trappings and its vague steampunk underpinnings Fury Road is really a ferocious Western - Stagecoach on wheels - a feature-length chase picture in which people make a break out of Dodge aboard a stolen tractor-trailer and head for safer territory (thats about all the plot there is really; Miller doesnt bother with cumbersome backstories or explanations). The fact that the person driving that rig happens to be a one-armed woman who can throw down like a man without losing her femininity is one of the many surprises of this wonderful thrilling adventure which also manages to make time for small moments of beautiful creativity (in one shot what initially appears to be a giant sand dune turns out to be Max buried under the dirt). Mad Max Fury Road has everything one could want from a Road Warrior sequel (lets just pretend Beyond Thunderdome never happened) from Millers R-rated gallows humor to his ability to visualize fantastical things and capture them on film in a way no one else would think to do. Spielberg will be jealous. And I havent even mentioned the films surprising surge of emotion in its final 30 minutes or the infusion of nutty tenderness Nicholas Hoult brings to the picture as a dutiful suicidal soldier or the guy riding on the front of one of the vehicles in the bad guys convoy playing a double-neck electric guitar that spews fire - a minor side character who practically steals the movie without uttering a word. Summer hasnt officially started yet and already the film to beat for the title of the seasons best has arrived. Go ahead. Get excited.

Tom Hardy vs. Mel GibsonMad Max creator George Miller returns after 30 years with actioners fourth installment""Mad Max Fury Road"" reminds us of what is truly lacking in movie theaters these days seat belts.Trust me youll be reaching for them while watching veteran filmmaker George Millers thrill ride which will blow your mind and senses to smithereens.Millers 150 million reboot is everything you could want in a summer movie. Its devilishly detailed stunningly photographed boldly imagined and acted. This is the way reboots ought to be done.""Fury Road"" continues and expands on the depleted post-apocalyptic world that ex-cop Max Rockatansky (now played by Tom Hardy) ventures through a hellish surreality choked with toxic air and mostly toxic people. In this fourth film in the series which started in 1979 the brutish Max teams up with one of the toughest female characters weve ever seen on screen Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron). Through a number of tightly edited sequences she and Rockatansky wind up being hotly pursued in the Wasteland by the evil and hideous Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne Toecutter from ""Mad Max"") who has an iron grip on his people and precious resources including water and even breast milk.Advertisement Joe has in tow his group of deluded Warboy minions -- young men fated for death who believe their master when he says getting to Valhalla is their greatest reward. And they want to get back what Furiosa has taken a rig with its secret cargo -- Joes five ""wives.""The plot takes some surprising turns along this fast and furious road and Miller and his special effects and stunt team throw at us numerous chases and showdowns along the way. Every one of them including a toxic sandstorm near the start and a climactic sequence at the end will leave you gasping for air.Its remarkable that at 70 the veteran filmmaker who also co-wrote and co-produced ""Fury Road"" leaves recent dystopian adventures in the desert dust shaping a vision brought to painter-like vividness by photography director John Seale (""The English Patient""). Miller has put a spark back into this overworked genre by mostly tossing aside todays over-reliance on computer-generated effects a fallback that often drains a production of its human emotion. Instead throughout the film the hues in various scenes evoke the feeling of such classics as Sergio Leones Westerns and Akira Kurosawas ""Seven Samurai."" With its countless improbable stunts involving motorcycles monster rigs souped-up cars even catapults this return to old-school filmmaking results in a movie thats more intense more real more elemental. Tom Hardy as Max Rockatansky in Mad Max Fury Road. (Jasin Boland/Warner Bros.) ( Jasin Boland/Warner Bros. ) Even better is the direction in which Miller and his co-screenwriters (comic-book writer Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris) have maneuvered this testosterone-fueled series. While Hardy handily takes the wheel from Mel Gibson who played him in the debut as well as in 1981s ""Mad Max 2 The Road Warrior"" and 1985s ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" it is the women who power ""Fury Road.""The Oscar-winning Theron is the perfect driver for Millers feminist vehicle. As the nearly bald Furiosa a renegade one-armed war-rig driver who wants to go home in a world where home no longer exists shes a force of nature. Her Furiosa is a fighter determined to do something right in a world that has been made wrong by men. Theron taps deeply into Furiosas humanity along with her feral determination. Her primal scream reverberates in our bones.As the ""wives"" Rosie Huntington-Whiteley (""Transformers Dark of the Moon"") Riley Keough (""Magic Mike"") Zoe Kravitz (""Divergent"") Abbey Lee and Courtney Eaton are impressive. So is Nicholas Hoult as War Boy Nux one of Joes minions who discovers that the life he so devoutly believes in -- yes theres religious symbolism here -- is actually flawed.What remains an absolute in ""Fury Roads"" whisk-right-by two hour running time is that Miller has breathed new life not just to his own series but the action genre itself. ""Fury Road"" will leave you breathless and anticipating what will come next for Max since Hardy has reportedly signed on for three more movies. Hopefully by then theaters will do us all a favor and install some seat belts. A scene from Mad Max Fury Road opening on May 15 2015. (Jasin Boland/Warner Bros.) ( Jasin Boland/Warner Bros. ) ""Lestat"" (""Interview With the Vampire"" ""Queen of the Damned"")Actors Tom Cruise and Stuart TownsendWho played it best? Cruise. Despite the uproar from fans and author Anne Rice alike Cruise did a fine job as the conflicted sensuous vampire even though physically he doesnt fit the part. It helped the movie he appeared in was simply better than the one featuring the attractive Townsend. Willy Wonka (""Willy Wonka amp; the Chocolate Factory"" and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"")Actors Gene Wilder and Johnny DeppWho played it best? Wilder. While Depp deserves credit for trying something different with his trippy candy man Wilders iconic take on the quirky Roald Dahl character had just the right sprinkling of weirdness and childlike wonder. Clarice Starling (""The Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Hannibal"" (the movie)Actresses Jodie Foster and Julianne MooreWho played it best? Foster. Both Oscar winners put a unique stamp on the FBI agent engaged in mind games with a cannibal serial killer. But Foster had the most screen time and she made every quivering second count as the haunted Clarice. Jack Ryan (""The Hunt for Red October"" and ""Patriot Games""/""Clear and Present Danger"")Actors Alec Baldwin and Harrison FordWho played it better? Ford. Even though Tom Clancys CIA tough guy was also played by Ben Affleck and Chris Pine on the big screen it really comes down to these two actors. Both nailed it but Ford made us feel the seething intensity of Ryan especially when his family got caught in the crosshairs. The Hulk (""The Incredible Hulk"" and ""The Avengers"" films)Actors Edward Norton and Mark RuffaloWho played it better? Ruffalo. Like Ryan the Hulk has been played by others -- Eric Bana and Bill Bixby on TV etc. Norton made an impressive Hulk but Ruffalos Bruce Banner wins us over playing the eccentric scientist.Print Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Curb Your Enthusiasm The long wait for new episodes is almost overGame of Thrones Season 8 definitely the lastReview Holocaust haunts family in The Gathering Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

No not what Mad Max drives. What ""Mad Max"" is. ""Mad Max Fury Road"" the latest in the post-apocalyptic series is like the cars that race across its wide screen a mad mechanical mashup -- part loving remake part revolutionary re-boot. Its got a masculine muscle-car body - all steel and edge and anger -- but its powered by an unapologetically fierce feminist engine. And once it revs up it never slows down. The movie starts not in the middle of things but after the end -- in a post-apocalyptic land where gas and water are things to fight over and civilization has devolved into fiefdoms. Standing apart from any tribe Max - his tragic backstory is purposefully vague - wanders the desert alone until he is taken hostage by a gang built on biker chic Latin names and Norse mythology. Theyre also devoted recyclers. Max for example will be used for his blood and organs. But then Imperator Furiosa a rebellious woman warrior among them helps the leaders young sister-wives escape along with a tanker full of gas. Max hitches a ride too. And with an ever-growing crowd of high-octane animals in pursuit they speed off in search of a legendary oasis. Sometimes admitted they go a little too fast. Director George Miller - who invented this series back in 1979 with the original ""Mad Max"" - has always been more of a visualist than a clear thinker and he sometimes stumbles over his own ideas. On one hand this is the kind of action movie even Alice Walker could cheer with smart strong women taking up arms against the white male patriarchy. On the other if its such a sexist society how did Furiosa ever ascend to a trusted position of power? And if this is such a bright liberated movie why are the female characters so generic (and the actors apart from Zoe Kravitz so pale)? Or the character names so stupid? (If you smirked at Imperator Furiosa wait until you meet Rictus Erectus.) Tom Hardy is fine as Max -like the original movies masochist Mel Gibson all he needs to do is endure - and Charlize Theron is terrific as Furiosa. So terrific in fact you may wish she was riding solo. Wouldnt that have been the most feminist act of all -- ""Mad Maxine""? (Supposedly theres a spin-off script ready to go.) But those small flaws in the story - some occasionally easy political posturing perhaps too many shallow characters - cant even come close to touching George Millers strengths A nightmarish visual imagery an easy command of composition a relentless sense of pace. Once Max breaks free of his bonds the chase begins - and rarely slackens for nearly two hours. New pursuers bound into the frame; unsuccessful ones crash against the sides and then messily explode into the foreground. (This is really a movie you want to see in 3D and on the biggest screen you can find.) In fact the photography is as pushed into overdrive as the cars. Entire sequences jump monochromatically into dusty red or cold grey. Action is mechanically sped up - a sort of visual stutter which could give the film the herky-jerky look of a hand-cranked silent but somehow only makes things feel more impatient and intense. And the production design is superb. Millers bloated grotesque villains - some of the ugliest plutocrats since Baron Harkonnen from ""Dune"" - are inventively loathsome. And his cars - Cadillacs on top of Cadillacs Volkswagens turned into gun turrets - look like everything you always wanted to do with your Revell models and didnt. No movie is (or should be) for everyone but ""Mad Max Fury Road"" is liable to divide even knowledgeable moviegoers. Those who have a visceral dislike of violence and the growing belief that sci-fi and fanboys are ruining cinema will probably find more evidence here. Those who prize visuals above all else will discover riches far beyond the usual Marvel blockbuster. But even those in the vast middle should be able to get on board. Or should get out of the way before theyre run over. Ratings note The film contains graphic violence. Mad Max Fury Road (R) Warner Bros. (120 min.) Directed by George Miller.

"Mad Max Fury Road review A symphony of vehicular mayhem - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Mad Max Fury Road A symphony of vehicular mayhem Mad Max Fury Road Jasin Boland / Warner Bros. Tom Hardy as Max Rockatansky in Warner Bros. Pictures and Village Roadshow Pictures ""Mad Max Fury Road."" Tom Hardy as Max Rockatansky in Warner Bros. Pictures and Village Roadshow Pictures ""Mad Max Fury Road."" (Jasin Boland / Warner Bros.) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Mad Max is non-stop vehicular mayhem. Of course. You remember ""Happy Feet."" This is George Millers ""Happy Wheels."" The creator of the original ""Mad Max"" trilogy has whipped up a gargantuan grunge symphony of vehicular mayhem that makes ""Furious 7"" look like ""Curious George.""The full title of Millers remake of ""Mad Max"" is ""Mad Max Fury Road."" It stars Tom Hardy who says very little in the old Mel Gibson role of the post-apocalyptic road warrior. Here the characters bacon is saved over and over by the revolutionary in training known as Imperator Furiosa. Charlize Theron plays her and ""badass"" doesnt really capture it. Theron out-Hardys Hardy in the nonverbal seething department and shes right at home in the scorched-earth landscapes shot in Australia and the South African Namib Desert. Well get into a few details about the set-up but honestly this ones about the music not the lyrics. The storys thin thinner than it seemed in the earlier pictures but crucially director and co-writer Miller delivers several variations on a signature shot. Its one he didnt invent but that he relishes more than life or fossil fuel itself the low asphalt-scraping cars-eye-view perspective as the vehicle barrels down the road with a faster vehicle (or three) coming up fast on the left and then zooming past en route to someones last ride.This is a maniacal chase picture as if you couldnt tell from the trailers many times more expensive to make than Millers first two ""Max""s back in the late-20th century. The new film carries a full but not suffocating load of digital effects that actually look like Miller oversaw their creation rather than simply turning them over to people hed only met on the phone. And the real star of ""Fury Road"" is second unit director Guy Norris. Here too the collaboration with Miller appears seamless. Wars over the remaining water and oil have turned humankind into a desperate bunch. Max roams the Wasteland. High above a rock formation sits the Citadel where the brutish overlord Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) rules a society built on slave labor the occasional water ration and a tremendous amount of cruelty.Max captured by Immortan Joes chalky minions is drained of his healthy blood which is greedily consumed by the boy-man they call Nux (Nicolas Hoult). Nux becomes a kind of mascot and insane-but-redeemable nephew figure to Max and Furiosa. They flee the Citadel with Mr. Bigs five comely wives who represent Mother Earth though they appear also to be representing job opportunities for a post-apocalyptic Maxim shoot. The bad men pursue in many loud street-illegal chariots. And there you have it. More plot than the movie actually contains. Check out the latest movie reviews from Michael Phillips and the Chicago Tribune. Millers dynamism behind the camera is well-known and its fun to see it unleashed. The director expands his ""Mad Max"" mythology into the biggest most relentless movie hes ever made which doesnt mean his best. It is to be sure one of his most idiosyncratic. Certain images such as the heavy-metal guitarist whose guitar spews fire chained to the front of a particularly evil weapon on wheels become leitmotifs you simply wouldnt find in any other movie. Also its unlikely that many directors would take the time to set up and dramatically justify the image of a tanker truck full of breast milk getting shot to hell.There are patches of ""Fury Road"" when the flourishes get to be a little much. The action veers into exhausting cleverness. The riskiest move is Millers decision to speed up the frame-rate of the action so that everything seems jumpy out of control both less and more than ""real."" Some will go for it; some will not. And I say good for Miller for making a big-budget movie that doesnt feel like the studio was breathing down Maxs neck every second.

Photo Jasin Boland MOVIE REVIEW Mad Max Fury Road Running time 120 minutes. Rated R (graphic violence disturbing images). Tom Hardy succeeds Mel Gibson in the title role of ""Mad Max Fury Road"" George Millers first Road Warrior movie in three decades -- but this spectacularly great reboot is surprisingly owned not by Hardy who is fine but by Charlize Theron. I wouldnt be at all surprised if Theron collected her third Oscar nomination (she won Best Actress for ""Monster"") for her dazzling work as Imperator Furiosa a smart fearsome one-armed rogue soldier bent on smuggling five women to freedom inside a gasoline truck with Maxs initially reluctant help. Charlize Theron as FuriosaPhoto Jasin Boland Millers old-school post-apocalyptic vision dazzles the eye and engages the mind in ways that practically no contemporary blockbusters do. The dialogue is sparing it works as a stand-alone story (you dont need to catch up on the three Gibson films) and isnt busy setting up a sequel. In short its a blessed deliverance from the tiresome universe-building sanitized violence and rampant sexism of say the bloated Marvel epics. As the trailers accurately promise ""Fury Road"" doesnt look like any film youve ever seen -- though the story is roughly like a 21st-century feminist take on John Fords classic ""Stagecoach"" set in a post-apocalyptic world as it might be grotesquely imagined by the 15th-century Dutch painter Hieronymus Bosch. Zoe Kravitz (foreground) and other ""breeders.""Photo Jasin Boland The women -- some of them pregnant -- are fleeing Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) who brutally rules a desert city called the Citadel and had imprisoned his five ""wives"" so he could force one of them to bear him a male heir. Joe leads a convoy of tricked-out vehicles with gonzo warriors to recover his ""property"" -- with Max spending much of the first half-hour in an iron mask serving literally as a human hood ornament (and blood donor) for Nux (Nicholas Hoult) arguably the nuttiest member of Joes army. Max eventually joins forces with Furiosa and provides some key advice but with Therons steely gaze stoic determination and action chops shes very much the one calling the shots for this badly outnumbered band. The escaped ""breeders (played by Rosie Huntington-Whiteley Zoe Kravitz and others) take up arms against the enemy along with some rather surprising allies they pick up along the way. Tom Hardy as MaxPhoto Jasin Boland Director Miller may be 70 and returning to the series after a couple of decades making family films (like ""Babe"" and ""Happy Feet"") but he blows away younger action directors with brilliantly staged and edited sequences in what amounts to a two-hour chase. The violence is often graphic but its never gratuitous. The director a former emergency room doctor makes every last drop of blood count. The violence feels real and consequential a rarity in todays heavy computer-massaged films. Filming in the Namib desert Miller has crafted a visual masterpiece combining dust fireballs mud blood gasoline and mothers milk in vividly imaginative ways that are hugely satisfying and never look fake. But its Therons determined wounded warrior -- much more than Hardys haunted revenge-seeking road warrior -- that ultimately makes this the summers first must-see movie. ""Fury Road"" is also available in a 3-D version which I havent seen. What looks very much like the finest action film so far this century hardly needs further embellishment.

(Jasin Boland) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated Friday May 15 2015 457 PM Title MAD MAX FURY ROAD Film Info A roaming warrior helps a group of women escape a tyrant. Director George Miller (200). R Violence. Area theaters. Opens Thursday night. Strap in load up and hang on because ""Mad Max Fury Road"" is a freaky ballsy phenomenal ride. The title character and his postapocalyptic land was introduced in the Australian thriller ""Mad Max"" (1979) immortalized in the 1981 classic ""The Road Warrior"" and last seen in the underappreciated ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" (1985). Back then the gonzo motorized mayhem was revolutionary. Now its destructo cinema races back to save us from the multiplex doldrums. What helps make it whirr and roar is a minimal use of CGI. Director George Miller has kept an element that made ""Warrior"" and ""Thunderdome"" special super-real smashes and crashes. This thick-skinned (but not heartless) reboot of an action-cinema milestone makes most Hollywood vehicles look like theyre stuck in third gear. The movie is set after the world has torn itself apart and blown parts of itself up following something called ""The Oil Wars."" Whats left of scraggly civilization worships and covets gasoline. Their ""blood is poisoned"" and two-headed lizards sit in the sand. In a mountainside fortress called the Citadel a cruel leader in a skull-like breath-mask named Immortan Joe sends skeletal punk-thugs called War Boys to do his enforcing. Its here that the grizzled wanderer Max (Tom Hardy) is brought after being captured as a kind-of human sacrifice. But the attention of the Citadel turns to a convoy led by Joes lieutenant Furiosa (Charlize Theron). Shes raced away with all five of Joes slave-wives one of whom is pregnant. Joe wants them back so Max is strapped to a battle-truck driven by the War Boy Nux (Nicholas Hoult) and the film goes from 0 to 100 in minutes flat. The dialogue is speckled with a futuristic Pidgin English thats part of the fun Among the rag-wearing wives is ""The Splendid Angharad"" (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) and ""Toast the Knowing"" (Zoe Kravitz). Two of the villains driving steroid-jacked cars are called Rictus Erectus and Corpus Colossus. A band of old-woman warriors is the Vulvalini. Speaking of woman warriors; Therons stump-armed raccoon-eyed ferocious Furiosa is one for the ages. With a metallic appendage and a knife in her side Furiosa commands attention whether driving like the Devil pausing for reflection or howling in rage. Hardy -- taking over from the previous films star Mel Gibson -- is compellingly odd. Muttering to himself and able to take an arrow or a bullet hes a brute with kind eyes and a twitchy distraction that comes from his damaged psyche. These movies play with their end-of-the-world timeline but in quick flashbacks we get glimpses of the family Max couldnt save from mankinds fate. Those glimpses are fast like everything. Some action scenes are sped-up to have a herky-jerky effect and the fantastic score filled with war drums and pulse-pounding rhythm adds to the propulsive momentum. Exactly 30 years since the last ""Mad Max"" entry Miller who made the previous ones fuel-injects the whole shebang. There are wild scenes filled with gutsy edgy stuff. Its frankly stunning that a major studio like Warner Bros. would sign off on some of the audacity here but the movie is stronger for it. Yet its not just the action that benefits. The storys theme of undaunted hope in the midst of appalling inhumanity makes it the rare summer event flick that has its brain stuck right next to its gas pedal. jneumaiernydailynews.com Catch ""Joe Neumaiers Movie Minute"" throughout the day Thurs. - Sun. on New Yorks WOR 710 AM and at wor710.com.

If youre a devotee of director George Millers earlier Mad Max adventures youre in for a thrilling reunion. If you havent met this international treasure yet prepare for a treat. This epic of the car chase genre is a gleefully violent vertigo ride defeating your expectations about what action movies normally do. ""Mad Max Fury Road"" is amazing dark disreputable playful fun pure madness wrapped in fan boy pulp. And every step of the way it is breathtaking. It makes ""Fast and Furious 7"" look like ""The Love Bug."" A plot synopsis would reveal part of the films fireworks and this is about thrills not plots. So lets be brief. Were in dystopian future-land. Max an apocalypse-surviving former cop is held prisoner in a city commanded by Immortan Joe a patriarchal monster. Max makes an adrenaline-fueled escape across the Australian outback in a massive roaring getaway tanker truck. Pursuing even faster are Joes road-rage thugs who are after his payload. Their wheels? Street-illegal racers weaponized with plenty of things that go boom. Think Roman chariot races at turbine speed with plenty more explosions. Thats the first act the second act and the third act. It opens with impending doom and never slows down knocking off supporting characters by the hundreds. And the fist pumps into the air for almost all fatalities are just as valid as cheering for the exploding shark in ""Jaws."" Keeping the audience at hypnotized attention isnt hard with a thundering punk rock soundtrack and stellar cast. Tom Hardy (""The Dark Knight Rises"") leads the chaos in the title role. Oscar winner Charlize Theron (""Monster"" ""Prometheus"") steals the stage as his warrior-woman opponent/ally Imperator Furiosa (I think thats Latin for fuming mad). Nicholas Hoult (""X-Men Days of Future Past"") does comic-relief sidekick duty as Nux a young nitwit militant from the bad side. Video (0233) Here comes Mad Max Fury Road other summer movies Then theres superb looking camera work (retina-searing work by Oscar winner John Seale) and surreal wasteland locations in Australia and Namibia. Its not a film of great depth but oh my goodness those surfaces Hardy a performer who can express panic and frenzy with a glance has at most 25 words of dialogue but he owns every shot. Watching him smash dodge shove and hang by his heels from a speeding 10-wheeler is viewing a gymnastic achievement. He has our feelings in a rugged grip too helping make this the most gut-wrenching and emotionally draining action film in years. All through the film Miller keeps upping the ante of the dilemma Max and his runaway partners face. Just when their circumstances seem at the most dire Miller always surprises us by making matters worse. One of those rare B movies that is also a dynamic work of art ""Fury Road"" is equally gross and engrossing. Theron is outstanding as the film confronts the misogyny of action films both satirically and for shock value creating moments that cause you to squirm and groan ""Oh no."" The fact that the storys endless carnage is the result of corrupt human impulses gives it a resonance beyond the scope of typical action fantasy. Were not facing an evil computer with an agenda of its own but a power-mad psychopath and self-proclaimed deity. Immortan Joe is tyranny made flesh the sort of human-twisting horror you might find in Goyas ""The Disasters of War."" The horror is at once specific and universal. There are images simultaneously hard to bear and uproariously funny. Bringing back Max it feels like Miller is having a laugh at 70 saying ""I made Babe and those Happy Feet movies while my kids were growing up now I can play with all the naughty stuff Ive been keeping out of film for 30 years."" He has created a stylish sequel that has its own integrity not just revived something that was popular. What I like best about this film is everything. ""Fury Road"" is a testament to exciting cinema and to the barbarity that human beings inflict on one another. When you watch this one buckle in tight grab the armrests and hold on for dear life. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

"George Millers Mad Max Fury Road reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up The Insane Ornate Doom Buggies of Mad Max Fury Road The Insane Ornate Doom Buggies of Mad Max Fury Road Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.May 12 2015 1159 AM Mad Max Fury Road Come for the feminist empowerment stay for the tricked-out nightmare doomcars. By Dana Stevens Mad Max Fury Road. Photo courtesy Jasin Boland/Warner Bros It was clear from the start that the Australian writer/director George Miller would be influential. His wildly successful 1979 debut Mad Max--to be followed by Mad Max 2 The Road Warrior (1981) and Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985)--created a vision of postapocalyptic punk dystopia that was dustier and more barren than the one Ridley Scott would put forth a few years later in Blade Runner but just as inspirational. (The trilogy has influenced everyone from Guillermo del Toro to Hype Williams to the creators of the Saw movie franchise who say they took their stomach-churning premise from a scene at the end of the first Mad Max movie in which a character is forced to contemplate cutting off his own foot in order to escape.) Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The way the world ends for Miller is not in overpopulated high-tech megacities slicked with film-noir rain but in something like the polar opposite. Millers nightmare of the future posits the planet as a parched desert landscape against which the worlds few remaining humans scratch out a meager violent existence equipped only with the salvaged remains of mid-20th-century technology. Its that future that 36 years after Mel Gibson first put the pedal to the metal as Max Rockatansky is looking more like the one we may be leaving to our own survivors--which makes the now 70-year-old Millers decades-later entry in the series Mad Max Fury Road opening Friday feel like less of a reboot of glory days past than a prequel of scary days to come. Miller was always influential but we didnt know he would turn out to be an environmental prophet. That same Max Rockatansky--now played by Tom Hardy the fine English actor best known to American movie audiences as the dapper Eames in Inception (since he was all but unrecognizable as the masked Bane in The Dark Knight Rises)--is the first human we encounter in Fury Roads moisture-deprived but color-saturated world. Hes sitting on a rock in the middle of nowhere making a meal of a two-headed lizard as he catches us up on the state of things in a terse philosophical voice-over ""As the world fell each of us in our own way was broken. It was hard to know who was more crazy--me or everyone else."" Advertisement Shortly thereafter the answer to at least that question becomes clear There are plenty of people in Fury Road who are considerably further along the insanity continuum than Max beginning with the despotic god-king Immortan Joe. Played by Hugh Keays-Byrne who portrayed the sadistic villain Toecutter in the 1979 original this grotesque figure--the lower half of his face concealed by a mask that appears to be fashioned from a human skull--has somehow managed to gain control of the worlds remaining water supply. Below his cliff-top cave the desperate populace waits rusty buckets upraised for him to pump when and for whatever length of time he pleases. Immortan Joe also seems to have cornered the futures market on good-looking fertile young women. He keeps five ""wives"" dressed in diaphanous white and looking cleaner and better-nourished than anyone else in sight as prisoners in his well-defended fortress the Citadel. Led by the warrior-gone-rogue Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) these young women--at least two of whom are pregnant with the warlords longed-for heir--manage to escape in one of the Citadels tricked-out salvage vehicles. Enraged at the loss of the royal harem Immortan Joe and his minions give chase in a convoy of even crazier-looking cars many of them consisting of multiple chassis welded together in towering piles. Max and the melancholy white-painted War Boy Nux (Nicholas Hoult) join Furiosa in her mission to find a safe haven for the fleeing women at first out of an instinct for self-preservation and later with a sense of true solidarity. Theres a mythic land known as ""the green place""--dont all apocalyptic movie futures share such an idyll?--where Furiosa intends to deliver these five supermodel-gorgeous sex slaves or die trying. But does the green place still exist? And even if it does is there any hope of reaching it while being chased across the salt flats by a fleet of vehicles so freakishly elaborate that one of them includes an electric guitarist suspended from its front as a living hood ornament shredding away as the dusty miles fly by? Riley Keough as Capable Courtney Eaton as Cheedo the Fragile Rosie Huntington-Whiteley as the Splendid Angharad in Mad Max Fury Road. Photo courtesy Jasin Boland/Warner Bros Miller has said that he likes to envision all the Mad Max movies as films that could play anywhere in the world without subtitles and Fury Road could almost function as a silent film albeit one with a deafeningly loud soundtrack. (The score is by the Dutch music producer Junkie XL the sound design by Christopher S. Aud.) Essentially the story is one extended spectacular car chase which changes directions mid-movie to retrace its own footsteps as the stunts grow bigger and more outrageous with each passing mile. Dialogue is minimal flinty and brusque--sometimes effectively so but equally often not. The fleeing wives are generally indistinguishable in their catalog-ready prettiness (though Zoe Kravitz stands out as the marvelously named Toast the Knowing) and Hoult is a sweet otherwordly presence as the once-fanatical War Boy turned love-struck peacenik. Then theres Therons grimly determined Furiosa her head shaved her forehead blackened with axle grease and one arm digitally severed near the elbow and replaced by a prosthetic metal hand. Furiosa manages to come across as a real and touching character despite being given very little backstory. In fact if the movie has a central protagonist its Furiosa not Max. Hardys character remains more indistinct perhaps because hes usually (sometimes comically) placed in positions of extreme passivity; for instance he spends most of one long chase sequence suspended upside down from the window of a moving vehicle his ankles secured only by Furiosas metal-enhanced grip. A late encounter with a pack of elderly female warriors brings the films feminist subtext to the fore This is a story about rescuing beautiful damsels in distress yes but most of the characters doing the truly competent rescue work are women too. Most of all though Mad Max Fury Road is about the cars the costumes and the generally whacked-out production design (by Colin Gibson who also worked as art director on Millers underrated 1998 live-action animal tale Babe Pig in the City). The sheer variety of bizarre conveyances on display brings to mind a perverse update of Richard Scarrys Busytown with its cars made of pencils pickles and toothpaste tubes. One grandly imagined war rig has the shell of an old Volkswagen Beetle mounted whimsically to its top; another is a porcupine-like solid mass of metal spikes on wheels; yet another seems to be a Chevy Chevelle mounted on tank treads. The undercarriage of a petrol tanker is decorated with rows of rusted skulls barnacle-like encrustations that look as if they grew there on their own. One gearshift--Furiosas--features a knob made from the top of a human femur. These design details executed with wit imagination and care gave me something to appreciate even when the adrenaline from the nonstop virtuosic car stunts started to run dry around the 45-minute point. It may be the case as Miller has claimed that the majority of Fury Roads effects were done without using CGI but even so the onslaught of action is so fast-paced and overpowering theres little time to appreciate Millers analog artistry and the feeling of being inside a video game--a sinking sensation familiar from less carefully orchestrated action movies--sometimes takes over. There will be viewers--including many with no connection at all to the old Mad Max trilogy--who will thrill to every pulse-pumping fuel-tank-exploding second of Mad Max Fury Road. I wasnt one of them but its impossible not to appreciate the septuagenarian Millers boundless energy and investment in a film franchise thats older by a few decades than many of its most enthusiastic audience members are likely to be.

It has been 30 years since the last anarchic outing ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" -- so long that the iconic role of bereaved cop-turned-drifter in a dead world can no longer belong to aging disgraced Mel Gibson. But the muted hulking Tom Hardy is a natural fit for taking Max into another round of energizing showdowns between various demented figures battling for superiority in a twisted fast-paced arena imported from the earlier movies but never this spectacularly realized. Like Max himself Millers stripped-down approach to staging intense and involving action sequences stands alone. Before all else the movies familiarity marks a return to form. In the years since his previous ""Max"" outings Miller has developed a peculiar filmography of mainstream works that smuggle mature themes into popular material that never demands it -- most successfully with ""Babe Pig in the City"" and the first ""Happy Feet"" -- even if the sheer cinematic virtuosity of the ""Mad Max"" movies went latent. Judging by the constant forward momentum of ""Fury Road"" Miller had a lot to get out of his system The movie starts at a high velocity and barely ever slows down. Max has come a long way since his familys death in the initial 1979 entry turned him into a solitary drifter in this dreary milieu but it doesnt take long to pick up where we left off. In an opening chase scene Maxs typically reliable Interceptor gets knocked around by a group of white-faced marauders that lock him up in the dungeon run by Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) a grill-masked lunatic who lords over his minions in a horrific desert outpost where the dictator hogs a water supply and locks up his women to breed his army of ghoulish followers. Within minutes were treated to roaring engines dust-caked showdowns a gripping chase through claustrophobic tunnels and a dangling crane. Miller swiftly beefs up these scenes with tidbits of backstory as Max sees flashes of phantoms from the traumatic past that still haunts him. Its just enough to provide a reminder of his chaotic present. ""My world is fire and blood"" he intones in an opening voiceover which is just as much a literal description of the ensuing mayhem as a figurative one.  Despite a visionary set design that consolidates the biker aesthetic of the second film with the grimly carnivalesque look of the second ""Fury Road"" maintains a fairly straightforward narrative trajectory as it barrels ahead almost entirely focused on a series of rapid-fire chase scenes. READ MORE Watch New Full-Length Mad Max Fury Road Trailer is the Most Insane Thing Youll Watch All Day After he escapes from a debilitating position strapped to the hood of his vehicle by one of his demonic captors Max teams up with a throng of female slaves led by the trenchant Furiosa (a bald scowling Charlize Theron intimidating for reasons beyond her characters metallic arm) to escape Immortan Joes daunting advances from behind the wheels of souped-up monster truck. Furiosa hopes to pawn off her supplies and find a legendary world of greenery she remembers from her youth while forming a tentative alliance with Max that deepens as the pair survive a series of violent encounters. Unwilling to trust anyone but committed to survival at all costs their unruly chemistry is the closest thing to a tight bond in the series since Maxs early family days. But their toughness has nothing on maniacal foe Immortan Joe -- whose appearance recalls oddly enough the muffled Bane character Hardy played in ""The Dark Knight Returns."" However Joe retains a far more menacing edge thanks to the sparsity of details surrounding his rule. Even as hes protected by throngs of white-powered foot soldiers at every turn Joes a terrifically effective super villain unafraid to get his hands dirty. Furiosas own clan who call themselves the Five Wives (a group that includes Zoe Kravitz and Abbey Lee) are a largely indistinguishable bunch although their own uneasy alliance with one of Joes pale-faced offspring (Nicholas Hoult) -- who defects to the other side after hes inadvertently trapped in their truck -- comes as close as this movie gets to conveying a semblance of warmth. Overall however the personalities in ""Fury Road"" remain gruff one-note creations but thats at least fitting for this distinctive world that hits one note time and again so well. Miller brings a near-abstract quality to the proceedings that elevates from them from the specifics of the story. As Max and Furiosa speed through the desert with Joe and his team in hot pursuit the procession moves through the barren environments as though traversing through grim sonnets. Most dialogue is defined by concise declarations or punchy asides on par with the expressionistic despair of the scenery. The words ""Who killed the world?"" are scrawled on walls. Maxs inevitable pep talk with Furiosa finds him declaring ""Hope is a mistake"" while the psychos chasing after him gear up for martyrdom they envision as ""riding to Valhalla."" The sense of peril culling from historical and mythological reference points is at once poignant and fragmentary. However the main effective ingredient in ""Fury Road"" is its ongoing motion. The chases largely pivot on insane car-to-car acrobatics narrow exchanges of gunfire and metal smashing together at ridiculously high speeds. Inspiring fear and giddy excitement in equal measures ""Fury Road"" suggests the unruly collision of ""Ben Hur"" and a Road Runner cartoon. Over the course of two hours there are times when the pattern of tense shootouts and erratic outbursts strain from redundancy. Miller sometimes emphasizes the over-the-top zaniness to a distracting degree. (One recurring flourish a lunatic guitarist on a moving platform blasting out distorted riffs alongside the action feels too excessive for its own good.) Nevertheless Miller keeps the action fluid from scene to scene offering a bracing alternative to countless murky CGI spectacles that dominate Hollywood studio product today. In ""Fury Road"" special effects come secondary to the visual marvels of the color palette meted out by cinematographer John Seale at every turn. One standout moment revolves around a ginormous environmental storm that calls to mind ""Wizard of Oz."" Nighttime scenes are filled with silhouettes against a landscape baked in blue. Orange-red flare guns pierce the barren sky. In essence Miller has made a silent film enhanced but not defined by its meaty sounds. The vivid post-apocalyptic scenery pays homage to Millers homegrown tradition. In the years since the last movie ""Mad Max"" has been welded into the DNA of modern action and sci-fi movies while inspiring countless imitators. But no matter these lofty expectations Miller avoids taking the overwrought material for granted by pushing it beyond pure stylistic posturing. Theres rich thematic material here that extends beyond the storys immediate appeal Long before Millers script closes with a quote by Albert Camus it delivers a cautionary tale against the threat of global warming depicts the greed and desperation surrounding natural resources and celebrates the prospects of civilian uprising under ridiculously daunting conditions. Insert your metaphorical reading here. ""Sooner or later"" announces one rebellious slave ""someone pushes back."" The underlying thrill of ""Fury Road"" stems from watching those words come to life on several levels. ""Mad Max"" doesnt just depict conflicts with evildoers in a tattered existence. It delivers a rare alternative to aggressively stupid action movies. At a time of great need Max rides again. Grade A- ""Mad Max Fury Road"" opens wide on May 15. It premieres at the Cannes Film Festival this week.

Reply StBob May 12 2016 648 pm Not a fan of action films found the last two Batman films turgid beyond belief but I quite liked this so if you do like action filsm you will probably like this a lot. One thing I appreciated is the action isnt CGI for the most part - there are actually moving things moving from frame to frame not some CGI white light explosion of nothingness. Reply koko May 12 2016 648 pm lol Reply Topiary May 12 2016 648 pm Action movie of the year doesnt really mean much. Im sure its a good film. Im looking forward to seeing it and hoping its a great film but in my opinion Terminator 2 is the best action movie ever made. All other action movies pale in comparison. That film has aged extremely well. Even the CGI still looks great. The thing about movies these days is that more and more the trailers are better than the movies themselves. If youve seen the trailer youve no need to see the film. Its THAT bad Reply Shay May 12 2016 648 pm i lost interest when i heard they cast a joke like hardy to the lead. waste of time and waste of money Reply troy May 12 2016 648 pm This film resonates with some of us who occasionally want to have some adrenaline rush. Good review Reply Nick Goins May 12 2016 648 pm ""Tone poem""? No this is what happens when your screenplay is so secondary to production design you just throw it out and stretch the chase scene you have in EVERYONE movie into 90% of the 120 Min run time. Character development is important to ANY story especially one that picks up 30 years after the last installment. There is none. George Millers reticence in confirming whether this is a reboot recon or sequel/prequel is telling theres not help to be found within this movie. Focus is a problem as well something many filmmakers seem to have issues with these days. For a film called MAD MAXFury Road theres very little Max in it focusing far more on the Furious character. Tom Hardy seems to have his hands full with a really dicey accent. Its a pretty looking movie and pretty disappointing. Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

He knows that a decade and a half is enough foreplay--its time to cut right to the climax. And for 120 minutes that climax doesnt let up. Mad Max Fury Road may be the first Tantric action flick. Sting will love it. Souped-up motorcycles soar over Nitro-fueled muscle cars Nitro-fueled muscle cars crash into tricked-out oil trucks and all of them explode into glorious fireballs. Fury Road not only captures the same Molotov-cocktail craziness of Millers masterpiece 1981s The Road Warrior--its also a surprisingly hypercaffeinated film for a director in his fifth decade behind the camera. The original Mad Max first hit theaters in 1979 when the world was squeezed in the viselike grip of a global oil crisis. The parched Australian outback of the film and its scavenger-punk inhabitants quest for precious fuel may have seemed cartoonish at the time but not totally implausible. In this thirsty lawless wasteland a hero emerged--a cop named Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson) whose family was murdered by a mohawked gang and for whom payback and survival were two sides of the same furnace-blasted coin. The reason I bring up this backstory is because you wont learn any of it from Fury Road. Miller either expects his audience to be fluent in the Maxverse or he simply doesnt care. Either way if its more than just a demolition-derby high youre chasing it helps to know a bit about the character or you might walk out a little hungry. That is after your retinas cool down and the adrenaline rush wears off. As everyone knows by now Max is no longer played by Gibson but instead by Tom Hardy. And while the red-hot British actors unapologetic brand of macho danger in films like Warrior Locke and as Bane in The Dark Knight Rises would seem ideal for such a ferocious gig the truth is he pales next to Gibson who managed to convey not just physical pain but the emotional kind too. At the beginning of the film Hardys Max is the hog-tied prisoner of an evil warlord with a platinum fright wig and a Skeletor muzzle named Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne ""Toecutter"" from the 1979 original). This kabuki-painted tyrant lords over a dystopian city of enslaved women that looks like a Hieronymus Bosch painting come to life. After escaping Max teams up with Charlize Therons Imperator Furiosa--a buzzcut badass with a mechanical arm (who it should be noted is the movies real hero)--and hightails it across the desert pursued by Immortan Joes psycho death-race marauders. Cue the drums of war the fire-and-brimstone pyrotechnics and the death-defying practical stunts. When you get past Millers orgy of loco action sequences--and theyre so good you may not need to--the story is pretty thin. Max Furiosa and their band of gypsies tramps and thieves (including a gonzo Nicholas Hoult) basically race from Point A to Point B realize Point B isnt what they hoped and race back to Point A. What made the first Mad Max such a future-shock classic wasnt just its jittery overcranked action served up with a sick smile but also its metaphorical depth. The new film is Im sorry to say just another summer action film (albeit a gorgeously shot one). In the end Mad Maxs road may be furious but it doesnt really lead anywhere.

How is George Millers bonkers exhausting no-future smash-em-up Mad Max Fury Road not one of those almost-was boondoggles mourned and dreamed of by fans a revered directors impossible vision that thanks to the un-stout hearts of studio beancounters never actually vaulted from storyboard to screen? A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - But Fury Road somehow is. In the era of greenscreened blockbusters we have an R-rated studio release on which a 70-year-old director blew hundreds of millions of dollars crashing real cars into each other in Namibia. You know the charge that Furious 7 feels like what you would get if you asked a Hot Wheel-loving ten-year-old to work out the beats of a screenplay? Fury Road is what the kid might dream up at fourteen stoned at the motocross keyed up on Mountain Dew and old Conan comics except instead of writing a script hes lighting those Hot Wheels on fire and chucking them at your face. Hes also touchingly a feminist and eager for you to know it. Plus hes tireless touched with some genius and you would not believe just how many of those cars he has to throw. Here is a movie whose lead (Tom Hardy) fifteen minutes in is lashed to the hood of a hopped-up flame-flatulent Chevy like hes the figurehead maiden on the prow of some sixteenth-century ship. A villain -- one of the films many bald scarred-over mud-caked cancer-ridden raccoon-eyed albinos -- has chained Hardys Mad Max there as a fuel source. Turns out in Millers wasteland the bad guys need to siphon off the blood of the rest of us especially while rocketing across the flatlands in a convoy that looks like Gwars remake of Cannonball Run. Film DetailsCritics Pick Mad Max Fury Road RatingR GenreAction/Adventure Running Time120 min. More Info Trailer Hardy just hangs on the hood through the first of many relentless terrifying time-stopping road wars. Max has an IV jacked into him feeding the driver an action-film innovation that had me squirming. The crashes and splosions and impalings trigger some pleasure in me but nothing like fear. But the thought of being whipped around by a crazed driver while donating plasma? For the movies first third my veins shriveled up as tight as angel-hair pasta. Like the Mad Max films from three decades ago Fury Roads script is stripped down to rage and momentum. Neither Hardy nor Charlize Theron speak much as they rumble across the desert and what we know of their characters comes from observed detail the way hes happy to abandon Theron and the young women she has saved to the warlord pursuing them or the way she hides a gun in every cranny of the cab of her rig and then a knife too in the stick of her stick shift -- Fury Road spits in the eye of automatic transmissions. His motivation at first is mere survival; it richens eventually to survival and hoping to get a barbed death-mask off his face. (Hardy probably tapped into his experience on the set of The Dark Knight Rises.) Hers is more complex so the movie has her say it out loud ""Redemption."" Then its back to the automotive combat a two-hour parade/destruction derby of rustbuckets so viciously spiked you could do a brisk business selling audiences tetanus shots after the movie. Theron is every bit the swaggering tough Hardy is. The women shes rescued are the supermodel wives of Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) a local ginger god-king in a bucktoothed gas mask. The brides prove capable road warriors themselves but theyre later outclassed by a ladies-only tribe of sexagenarian ass-stompers on motorbikes. Like Max and Nux an albino slave of that god-king (played by Nicholas Hoult) theyre survivors trying to escape the exploitative logic of Millers wasteland which will harvest a commodity from anyone powerless Maxs blood Nuxs strength the wives fertility and the breastmilk of the women Immortan Joe has imprisoned in his dairy. Miller and his screenwriters (Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris) have the good taste not to assign the heroines any of-our-culture girl-power sass -- early on when Therons Furiosa fights Max to a draw she doesnt shout ""Youre going down bitch"" The story is streamlined but the action isnt. At one point Miller has four different convoys pursuing Therons rig and his cameras seem to be fighting to keep up with the dozens of cars onscreen at any moment. Hollywood action today is usually a stuttering blur of CGI bone-crushing where you have to take the movies word for it that something worth your awe has happened. Millers car-v.-car dust-ups are something different altogether Real cars practical stuntwork and the return of the thrill of believing what youre seeing -- and wondering how they pulled it off especially as those albino warriors swoop up and down the caravans on harpoons and chains and great bending flagpoles. The feeling here is of real events Miller and his team happened to be covering as if the worlds best-equipped newsvan were catching impossible vehicular mayhem en route to Burning Man. That said I wish the skies werent so often digitally sweetened. Some of the rawness of the original Mad Max films is lost and sometimes everything looks just a touch too pretty. During a mid-film chase I caught a glimpse of a wafer-thin half-moon reeling across the edge of the screen and I was heartened They let through something that just happened to have been there the day they were filming the way movies used to work. Later the moon and stars seem juiced the same overbearing visions we get in every other blockbuster.On ground though the design is perhaps more memorable than the stuntwork. The junkshop convoy built for the film those armadilloed muscle cars and Bigfoot-wheeled Caddies is ingenious and hilarious like what Ed Roth might have come up with if hed turned pirate. As the action ground on wearing me down the cars themselves continually dazzled me with their invention One truck is all amplifiers pyro blasts a timpani drum corps and a shredding guitar player sort of like Ozzfests entry in the Rose Parade. Still for all the ways the movie feels singular and impossible like something the studio suits couldnt possibly have signed off on Fury Road also feels entirely of its era. I admire its craft and cruel wit and its willingness to trust us to work out the particulars of its world but it lulled me into that familiar state of summertime action fatigue of being worn down by the violence rather than geared up of waiting the mayhem out rather than tracking it. Its an end-of-the-world thriller that can bum you out by suggesting the death of our own film culture. About 90 minutes in as spiked-over jalopies caromed again and again into Therons big rig my dazzlement sank into something like horror What if the wasteland rage of Fury Road is the only feeling studio movies of the future bother to stir in us? Were strapped to the hood and who knows whats being siphoned from us. 2 Photo by Jasin Boland Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Alan Scherstuhl Follow studiesincrap Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

Mad Max Fury Road to Screen at Cannes Film Festival Charlize Theron Inks First-Look Deal With Universal Cable Productions Three decades away from the series hasnt diminished writer-director George Millers ability to craft an intense breathless opera of violence and vehicular mayhem Just when we think the Hollywood sequel-reboot-retread machine has worn itself down to a useless nub along comes a movie to remind us that sometimes another dip in the same well can taste just as sweet. Thats certainly the case for ""Mad Max Fury Road"" the fourth of director George Millers smash-em-up derbies and the first one since 1985s ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome."" Yes its been 30 years and yes Mel Gibson is no longer playing the titular road warrior but Millers skill at this sort of grand adventure has only grown in the meantime; ""Fury Road"" is a breathlessly intense opera of violence and vehicular mayhem that demands both awe and multiple viewings to absorb everything thats happening in his packed but never overcrowded widescreen vistas. See Video Tom Hardy Runs From the Living and Dead in Mad Max Fury Road Trailer In the same way that the original 1979 ""Mad Max"" was the ""Citizen Kane"" of gut-bucket Australian exploitation cinema ""Mad Max Fury Road"" may well be the ""Gotterdammerung"" of drive-in movies. It has its roots in the Western and the post-apocalyptic road-rage action saga (which the second ""Mad Max"" outing 1981s ""The Road Warrior"" helped to create) but it also feels like an epic mic-drop where Miller dares anyone else to follow in his tire treads. (If nothing else this could be the movie that kills the blue-and-orange color scheme if only because no one else is ever going to blue-and-orange as hard as ""Fury Road"" does. Barring of course a ""Smurfs"" sequel set in a sherbet factory.) Also Read Russia Blocks Tom Hardy Movie Tom Hardy fills Mel Gibsons leather jacket with only a slight tweaking of the Max Rockatansky character; in the first ""Mad Max"" our hero is sent around the bend after a group of bikers kills his wife and infant son but this Max lost a spouse and a young daughter and its that little girl who keeps appearing to a haunted guilty Max accusing him of failing to save his family. Given his inner turmoil its no surprise that he lets his guard down long enough to be captured by minions of Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne whom ""Mad Max"" fans will remember as the evil Toecutter). Joe rules over a citadel in the wasteland parceling out precious water to his followers and raising a troupe of ghoulish gung-ho adolescent males known as ""War Boys"" who commit mayhem on Joes behalf thinking that they are living a ""half-life"" and that Valhalla awaits them after their demise. Also Read Hot Pursuit Studio Split Will Save Warner Bros. - But What About Mad Max? Both the captured Max and his car are stripped for parts (hes tattooed on the back with his status as a universal blood donor) and his initial attempt at escape goes nowhere. But when Joes trusted lieutenant Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) turns her mission to collect gasoline and bullets into something else entirely Joe sends his War Boys after her including Nux (Nicholas Hoult) who currently happens to be using a chained-up Max as his human blood bag. What happens next is best left unspoiled and ""Mad Max Fury Road"" will benefit from first-time viewers going in knowing as little as possible. (What I just described elapses in the first ten minutes. Try not clicking on the trailer that appears below.) Suffice it to say that Miller and co-writers Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris know when to thrill us and when to let us breathe how to introduce an entire society without losing sight of individual characters and why hope might still exist even when all seems lost. Where ""Fury Road"" stands apart from so much of todays action cinema is that the human element remains front and center; its one thing to watch an Avenger or one of the ""Fast and Furious"" drivers defy logic and gravity -- not that that cant be lots of fun -- but theres something more direct in watching people crawling on the outside of fast-moving vehicles or worrying about getting plucked from same by one of the bad guys that adds an additional relatable frisson to each action sequence. See Photos Mel Gibson Drops in on Tom Hardy at Mad Max Fury Road Los Angeles Premiere (Photos) Hardy has now appeared in both of the decades great road pictures although his role here couldnt be more different than last years ""Locke""; that film had him taking phone calls from start to finish whereas his tormented Max barely opens his mouth with his profound silences never diminishing his screen presence much in the same way that Miller so often generates thrills over what we cant see as much as over what we can. Theron matches his performance throughout creating an Amazonian warrior whose intensity is only increased when she makes a smoky eye reach all the way to her hairline. Theron and Hardy have one of the screens most powerful man-on-woman fights since ""Faster Pussycat Kill Kill"" and at no moment does one ever think that Theron is at a disadvantage against this worthy opponent. (Despite the testosterone on display here its girl power that fuels a great deal of ""Fury Road"" with some indelible moments provided by a talented ensemble of actresses both young and more experienced. Going into more detail would mean revealing more of the plot.) There are visuals in ""Mad Max Fury Road"" that wont soon be forgotten from the sight of a trussed-up Hardy attached to a car like a ships mast to the mother of all sandstorms to the heavy-metal guitarist and drummers that accompany the War Boys into battle to the secret of how the elites in Joes kingdom stay so well-fed. Miller redefined action cinema with ""The Road Warrior"" and its no stretch to suggest that ""Fury Road"" ups the ante on what the genre might deliver in the future. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

May 11 2015 | 0700AM PT Even the Fast and Furious movies look like Autopia test drives next to George Millers powerhouse reimagining of his iconic Mad Max franchise. Thirty years have passed since our last visit to George Millers sun-scorched post-apocalyptic wasteland and yet ""worth the wait"" still seems a puny response to the two hours of ferocious unfettered B-movie bliss offered by ""Mad Max Fury Road."" The sort of exhilarating gonzo entertainment that makes even the nuttier ""Fast and Furious"" movies look like Autopia test drives this expertly souped-up return to Max Rockatanskys world of ""fire and blood"" finds Tom Hardy confidently donning Mel Gibsons well-worn leather chaps. Still the tersely magnetic British star turns out to be less of a revelation than his glowering co-lead Charlize Theron decisively claiming her place (with apologies to Tina Turner) as the most indelible female presence in this gas-guzzling testosterone-fueled universe. It remains to be seen whether Theron will boost distaff turnout for Warner Bros. heavily marketed May 15 release but either way word-of-mouth excitement over the films beautifully brutal action sequences should lend it tremendous commercial velocity through the summer and beyond.SEE MORE Cannes Film Festival Miller may be better known of late for directing the (ostensibly) younger-skewing likes of ""Babe Pig in the City"" (1998) and the two ""Happy Feet"" musicals but for the many who have longed for him to return to his down-and-dirty Ozploitation roots ""Fury Road"" will seem nothing less than the fulfillment of a dream -- not least the writer-directors own. To describe the production as long-gestating doesnt do justice to the sheer litany of setbacks delays overhauls recastings and budget inflations that have plagued the picture since Miller first envisioned it years ago when it might still have been plausible for Gibson to reprise the role that made him a star. Suffice to say that for all the obstacles the writer-director and his collaborators endured in the interim the finished film feels entirely of a piece with its three predecessors never mind that the combined costs of the latter are dwarfed by ""Fury Roads"" budget (reportedly well over 150 million). We are admittedly a long way from the lean unnerving outback fable of ""Mad Max"" (1979) and an even longer way from the weirdly arresting kid-friendly detours of ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" (1985). Vastly more complex on a technical scale but simpler on a conceptual one ""Fury Road"" is for all intents and purposes a two-hour car chase interrupted by a brief stretch of anxious downtime and realized with the sort of deranged grandiosity that confirms Millers franchise has entered its decadent phase. All the more remarkable then that the movie still manages to retain its focus achieving at once a shrewd distillation and a ferocious acceleration of its predecessors sensibility. There is gargantuan excess here to be sure -- and no shortage of madness -- but there is also an astonishing level of discipline. Wisely Miller and his co-writers (the comicbook artist Brendan McCarthy and original ""Mad Max"" actor Nico Lathouris) seem to have taken their cues from the spare yet sturdy narrative architecture of the series acknowledged high point ""Mad Max 2 The Road Warrior"" (1981) whose influence can be felt even in the new films bare-bones prologue. Years after some unexplained cataclysm the world has fallen into lawless disarray as Hardys Max briefly explains while being pursued across a landscape of hot orange dunes and endless horizons (the Namibian desert stood in for Australia this time around). The chase soon ends with our hero captured imprisoned and tortured in the Citadel a desert stronghold ruled by a despotic warlord known as the Immortan (Hugh Keays-Byrne) who has enslaved what remains of the local populace by exercising miserly control over the water supply (inadvertently bearing out Keegan-Michael Keys California-drought joke at the recent White House Correspondents Dinner). Fans will remember (if not necessarily recognize) the Australian character actor Keays-Byrne as having played the Toecutter in the original ""Mad Max"" and his appearance here suggests a hideous heavy-set reincarnation of that earlier villain complete with snaggle-toothed face mask and kinky breathing apparatus. His male soldiers or ""war boys"" show their respect for their leader by sharing his gloriously awful fashion sense -- their torsos branded and bared covered in white body paint and blinged out with shrunken-head necklaces and other demonic accouterments. The films first half-hour alone is a marvel of freakshow aesthetics Blood banks and breast pumps are among the Immortans more imaginative means of controlling and sustaining his people while skulls figure prominently in Colin Gibsons elaborately grotesque production design and Jenny Beavans richly imagined costumes which are at once outlandish and pinpoint-precise. Setting the plot in motion -- and lending the film the swift steady undercurrent of rage suggested by its title -- are the five beautiful young women the Immortan has taken as his ""wives"" (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley Zoe Kravitz Riley Keough Abbey Lee and Courtney Eaton) whom he keeps locked away and forces to bear his children. Their defender and rescuer is Imperator Furiosa (Theron) a formidable warrior with a mechanical left arm who is tasked with replenishing the Citadels fuel reserves at nearby Gastown; she seizes the opportunity to smuggle the women out of the stronghold in a massive armored truck. When the Immortan sends his war boys after them with Max himself lashed (temporarily at least) to the front of a minions car the proceedings kick into high gear. As evidenced by everything from the original ""Mad Max"" trilogy to ""Babe Pig in the City"" Miller is a wizardly orchestrator of onscreen mayhem and in the two lengthy chase sequences that bookend ""Fury Road"" he ascends to that rare level of action-movie nirvana where a filmmakers sheer exuberance in every detail becomes one with the audiences pleasure. Everything we see here seems to have sprung fully formed from the same cheerfully demented imagination -- whether its the cars that look like overgrown porcupines on wheels the poles that catapult the war boys from one vehicle to the next or the fiery windstorm that sets in mid-chase making short work of some of the less well-armored participants. Adding yet another frisson of excitement (as well as a hint of anti-terrorist subtext) is the fact that the war boys arent just killers but fanatics brainwashed into believing eternal paradise awaits them if they die in battle. This may explain their devil-may-care habit of crawling over and under their vehicles while theyre in motion like kids navigating a jungle gym at 150 miles per hour. Miller conjures a vibe somewhere between monster truck rally in hell and Burning Man death-metal concert -- as signaled by the very funny inclusion of a rocker whose fire-breathing electric guitar seems to be at least one source of the pummeling wall-to-wall score (by the Dutch musician Junkie XL who recently scored ""Run All Night"" and ""Divergent""). The magnificence of the below-the-line contributions can hardly be overstated particularly the outrageously acrobatic fight choreography and the seamless visual-effects work all lensed by d.p. John Seale in dynamic enveloping widescreen images. If it sounds interminable -- and for viewers not on the films specific wavelength even a minute of this stuff will be hard to take -- rest assured that Miller proves himself a maestro not only when hes slamming huge metal objects together but also when attending to such subtler matters as pacing and modulation (with the invaluable assistance of his editor and wife Margaret Sixel). Notably our engagement doesnt wane even when ""Fury Road"" downshifts into an interlude of tense close-quarters intimacy as Max lone road warrior that he is must reluctantly endure the company of Furiosa and her five comely refugees. The feminist undercurrents rippling through this movie are by turns sincere calculated and teasingly tongue-in-cheek Our first good glimpse of the wives clad in skimpy white rags and gathered around a water spout plays like a vision out of ""Girls Gone Wild Coed Car Wash."" Even when they join in the fight it can be hard to tell where erotic fantasy ends and empowerment fantasy begins which is very much in keeping with the films unapologetically grindhouse attitude. Yet if ""Fury Road"" doesnt deliver as pure a hit of girl-power retribution as say Quentin Tarantinos ""Death Proof"" its hard not to respect the dramatic stature with which Miller elevates his female characters; Huntington-Whiteley and Kravitz in particular embody the sort of quiet defiance that ensures these women though victimized are never reduced to mere victims. ""You know hope is a mistake"" Max warns Furiosa late in the game. But even as it plunges us back into a vividly familiar realm of nihilism and despair ""Mad Max Fury Road"" never feels even remotely cynical -- or exploitative. Theres nothing but tenderness in the fiercely protective manner with which Furiosa and the five wives regard one another or in the key supporting role of Nux (a wonderful Nicholas Hoult) an eagerly aggressive young war boy whose dramatic shift in perspective takes the story in an unexpectedly poignant and romantic direction. As for Max himself he remains a thin tenuous figure at best -- less a fleshed-out character than an avatar of revenge and survival -- which is precisely what has made him such a durably iconic creation over the years. Mad Max 2.0 comes saddled with a slightly different tragic origin story referenced in quick hallucinatory memory blips involving a young girl (Coco Jack Gillies) but we accept Hardy in the role instinctively -- aided by the cruel iron mask that obscures much of his face until the movies midpoint but also by the actors taciturn charisma. Still theres no denying that Miller and his collaborators have subtly conspired to put our hero in the passenger seat of his own reboot while deftly ceding the wheel to Therons Furiosa and the characters rapport is as physically electrifying as it is emotionally charged. Tellingly plans are reportedly in the works for a ""Fury Road"" sequel called ""Mad Max Furiosa"" raising the expectation -- perhaps unreasonable on the strength of Millers powerhouse movie -- that this duos finest hour may yet be ahead of them.

Simon says May 26 2015 at 555 pm Have to say I was disappointed when I saw this film in 3D. The action was very well done but the colours were muted the characters were so thin that the only thing distinguishing most of them was their hair colour and the plot could be described accurately in a handful of sentences.

Dont be a freakin word Nazi. Orson Wells says May 14 2015 at 753 pm I stopped going to movies years ago F Hollyweird too many bad remakes too much CGI too much blood and gore sex and just plain disgusting nasty humor nothing original and nothing with good writing or acting anymore I did go see Appaloosa which was awesome and one of my favorite movies and Im not crazy about westerns. Super 8 was a great node to classic 80s movies. but other than that nothing I was excited about this since I saw the original Mad Max before Road Warrior both are two of the best REAL action movies ever made. The trailer for this is over done over produced CGI SPECIAL EFFECTS Is there even a real car in the movie? I cant stand Theron who other than her incredible looks CANT ACT Im glad I read reviews before I paid Hollyweird money for this crap Ill just watch Mad Max and Road Warrior again and again and again Reply DanZee says May 15 2015 at 1247 pm 80% of the special effects are real not CGI. Reply Word says May 26 2015 at 1003 pm Not you DanZee the troll Word says May 26 2015 at 1002 pm And yet youre here troll. lucylu (indi15243) says May 12 2015 at 902 pm This film needs to make a lot of money and it probably will if theres lots of violence and explosions. The films budget is really big closing in on 200 million with so many rewrites and reshoots. MM needs to make minimum 500 million.

Daily Edition Login to download Mad Max Fury Road Film Review 700 AM PDT 5/11/2015 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS After a long absence Mad Max is back and in fine form TWITTER Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron headline George Millers reboot of his cult postapocalyptic franchise. Thirty years after surviving Thunderdome the reluctant warrior of modern movies first and most memorable postapocalyptic action-fantasy series is finally back and ready for more in Mad Max Fury Road. George Miller has directed only five films in that time a three of which starred pigs and penguins a but it can safely be said that this madly entertaining new action extravaganza energetically kicks more ass as well as all other parts of the anatomy than any film ever made by a 70-year-old -- and does so far more skillfully than those turned out by most young turks half his age. Although the earlier entries were made before the target audience for this one was even born (its new leading man was just a baby when the first one was released) Mad Max has lingered in the zeitgeist through the years and a fair portion of the international public that has just wound down from Furious 7 will be happy to suck in the fumes from this equally action-packed and infinitely superior film. One could plausibly observe that Fury Road is basically The Road Warrior on a new generation of steroids and no doubt some critics will leave it at that; like the second and best film in the series this one is mostly devoted to maniacal anarchic goons chasing Max and his small group of rebels across a scenically parched desert and leaving some spectacularly destroyed vehicles in their dust. The new film certainly boasts a higher percentage of flat-out amazing action than any of its predecessors and thats probably enough said for most of its potential audience. Read more Inside the Fury Road Premiere With Tom Hardy Mel Gibson and Lisa Marie Presley Perhaps the long gestation period served it well. While very similar to its predecessors in almost every way the film has devilishness in its details the tribal-style makeup the endlessly inventive vehicles and armaments the wild costumes and facial adornments radiantly scorched locations that resemble a and yet go beyond a the series previous wasteland evocations and a society equally lawless but more entrenched than those seen in earlier films (one that is in fact presided over by the same imposing actor who played the chief bad guy in the original Mad Max in 1979). And then theres the new leading actor Tom Hardy whos so ideal a replacement for Mel Gibson that one wouldnt want to imagine anyone else having taken over the role. Rewatching the initial two installments today its striking to see how little Max Rockatansky (whose name is uttered just once in the first film) actually does during long stretches of them and so it is here; at the outset hes captured by soldiers of the Citadel and detained in a rocky hellhole where thousands of wailing captives perform slave labor while awaiting small rations of precious water dispensed by their tyrannical captor from his looming cliffside headquarters. When the time comes to hit the road Max his face confined behind a trident-like mask is strapped like a grille ornament on the front of a marauding car a predicament he is not expected to survive. But emerge from it he does of course and slowly the man behind the victim emerges -- first to exciting then to ultimately touching effect in the final scene. Its as if Hardy was cast for his brawn but ultimately used for his soul. Except for its mechanized details the heavy chains pulleys and steam-punk/heavy metal aspects of which lend a certain 19th century feel the world on display here is straight out of dire early biblical times. Presiding over the Citadel is the fearsome Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne the nasty Toecutter in Mad Max) who has grotesque offspring sports flowing gray locks and wears a toothsome facemask fed by large oxygen tubes. The slaves are covered in ashen white powder and live in a state of starvation and terror enforced by violent punks known as War Boys. The story cooked up by Miller and co-screenwriters Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris is no more complex than this Entrusted by Immortan Joe with driving the large War Rig truck across the desert to an oil-producing outpost tough ruling-class babe Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron with close-cropped hair and raccoon eyes) instead diverts it across the desert with an illicit cargo -- Immortans harem of breeding wives who have memorable names such as Capable Cheedo the Fragile and best of all Toast the Knowing. When first glimpsed they look like a bunch of supermodels strewn across the desert for an exotic fashion shoot although one of them the Splendid Angharad (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley a real-life supermodel) is soon due to give birth. Read more Tom Hardy Says Theres ""No Shadow of Doubt"" Hell Do Another Mad Max The first two Max features ran barely 90 minutes and it takes guts and real confidence to dare push a straight chase film with very little dialogue to two hours. But Miller has pulled it off by coming up with innumerable new elements to keep the action compelling the pitiless mindset of a brutish society; bending poles sticking up from vehicles that allow marauders atop them to be lowered into enemy trucks for hand-to-hand combat; an insane heavy metal guitarist affixed to one of the Citadels rigs whose raucous wailing and flame-throwing ability perfectly express this worlds extremity; and a central woman missing one arm whos as tough-minded as any man but also retains a special link to a remote society of women she intends to find. During the first extended high-speed jaw-dropping chase of Furiosa by the goon squad which only ends when its engulfed by an enormous desert dust storm Max remains frustrated by the chain linking him to his tormentors rig. But developing any trust with Furiosa takes considerably longer; she wants to kill him immediately and be done with it. They are it would seem potential soul mates but the world they inhabit is not exactly conducive to developing trust much less anything of a more amorous nature. Life is in this world not only cheap but almost assuredly very short. If one wanted to map out a chronology of Maxs life and adventures it would no longer make any sense in terms of the mans age nor does it matter at all. Miller recently absolved himself of any need to somehow explain the characters newfound youthfulness by comparing him to James Bond; Max just goes on and on with perennial access to rejuvenation via new actors. The difference between this and Bond and many other such durable series is that its so palpably the product of one mans imagination a man who also possesses the skill discipline and energy to put it all up on the screen so convincingly. Mad Max films are known for the moments when the cars superchargers are engaged for surges of speed and its clear that Millers personal superchargers are in excellent working order. The colors are bold the Namibia locations look like Arizona on steroids virtually all the action looks real (thoughts of CGI only intrude with the massive dust clouds and certain personal and vehicular wipeouts) cinematographer John Seales cameras are everywhere they need to be to record the action maximally and Junkie XLs score hammers and soars. Second unit director and stunt coordinator Guy Norris clearly deserves major credit for delivering much of whats most eye-popping onscreen and the film never sits still for more than a moment or two. Watch more Watch Tom Hardy Play Both Kray Twins in Legend Teaser Trailer Miller originally spoke of filming a sequel called Furiosa back-to-back with this one so presumably he has material more or less ready to go and Hardy has claimed hes signed for three more installments. In other words the world may not have heard the last of Mad Max.

In an age of weightless movie spectacles heres a movie that feels like it was made by kidnapping 150 million of studio money fleeing with it to the Namibian desert and sending footage back to Hollywood like the amputated body parts of a ransomed hostage.Its been 30 years since we last watched Mel Gibsons Max Rockatansky drift into the horizon in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome but the Road Warrior hasnt aged a day. Hes been transformed from a reluctantly charismatic Gibson into a terse Tom Hardy. Yet much has changed in the wasteland that Max wanders. While previous episodes were set amid the rubble of a ruined world the colourful hyper-saturated landscapes of this new movie locate the story closer to the dawn of a new civilization than the twilight of an old one. Things begin inside the mountain stronghold ruled by Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) an inbred monster who lords over a society that guzzles its citizens like fuel. Women are drained for their breast milk girls are farmed for their wombs and men like Max are used as vehicle ornaments called bloodbags. Unsurprisingly Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) Joes one-armed lieutenant is ready for a change. When she drives off with his prized concubines the warlord unleashes a suicidal eight-cylinder army on their trail. Pretty much the entire film is a screaming death race down Fury Road.Marrying the biting frenzy of Terry Gilliams film universe with the explosive grandeur of James Cameron Miller cooks up some exhilaratingly sustained action. But the key to this symphony of twisted metal is how the film never forgets that violence is a sort of madness. Millers world is a raw portrait of man at his most primitive and the oppression of women has long been a recurring motif. With Therons Furiosa behind the wheel though Fury Road steers this macho franchise in a brilliant new direction forging a mythical portrait about the need for female rule in a world where men need to be saved from themselves.Thats why Max is an enduring hero he knows when to drive off into the sunset. This time he leaves a generation of blockbuster cinema choking on his dust.

Relentlessly crazy...havent seen a film like this in a very long time. Definitely one to see at the cinema.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJun 2 20151 of 2 found helpfulChris JFeaturedthis was incredibly boring after enjoying 10 moinutes of some good special effects it had nothing more to say  far too violent with no purpose whatsoever and no story this is nowhere near as good as the originals. Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMore2 minutes agoAdrian HTastemakerFeaturedThis faced paced adrenaline fuelled action features Tom Hardy as Mad Max replacing the legendary Mel Gibson. Alongside Hardy Charlize Theron joins the franchise as the one armed Furiosa. The plot is basically a 2 hour car chase through the Australian outback. Tom Hardy has very little dialogue and often takes a back seat to Charlize Theron which I feel adds to the overall dynamic of the film.Well worth a watch and I can say that 3D adds a lot having seen it in both 2D and 3D. This film is for everyone and not just fans of the original trilogy.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreDec 9 2015Alex PlimmoderatorStaff WriterFeaturedThis film is breathless and intense and itll leave you feeling the same way. Sure it doesnt waste much time on dialogue or a complex storyline but who needs that when youve got a desert full of oily trucks and cars revving around and bumping into one another? This is one of the purest action movies Ive ever seen - certainly not a disappointing continuation of the Mad Max franchise.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreDec 9 2015Masumi SFeaturedWhat a disappointment all it is a chase movie they escape then get chased get to freedom go oh? Then return thats it Feck glad I only watched it on an airplaneHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreAug 20 2015mcuttleTastemakerFeaturedWrite a review...This has to be one of the best action movies Ive ever seen although I do disagree with a friend of mine who said ""never have I been so breathless and so bored at the same time"". For sure it is effectively just one massive car chase but the mix of bat sht crazy visuals such as electric guitarists swinging on the front of diesel beasts or what looks like a futuristic Peter Stringfellow trying to get his strippers back makes for one hell of a ride This isnt Maxs story its Imperator Furiosas. Charlize Theron is a total badass in this movie and I cant wait to see it again. Ill just bring some paracetamol next time.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJul 27 2015Adam NFeaturedAbsolutely mental from beginning to end love the concept of meat bags the guitar dude them pole people... Saw the first film for the first time a couple weeks back and didnt like it this is non stop action and completely nuts very enjoyable filmHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJul 9 2015Carly-Ann ClementsStaff WriterFeaturedI have never left a cinema so tense before in my life. If Max does indeed have high octane blood I must have been getting my very own transfusion because my heart was pounding right from the start.This film is stunning from beginning to end. Its rare to see something that has such a specific visual goal and to nail it in every scene. The attention to details is impeccable making the film all consuming. The fact that this is basically a two-hour car chase made me surprised that not only were the characters complex but I became entirely attached to them also. Charlize Theron (one of if not the best female actor working at the moment IMO) gave a seamless performance and Tom Hardy slipped into the role of Max effortlessly.Yes it was more about the action and about the grandeur of the set and design but this film made some great statements and told a story.I would say Id watch it again right now but I dont think my heart can take it.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJul 9 2015LSOFeaturedI loved it  Especially in bold IMAX 3D )  Thought Charlize Theron was superb as the hardcore warrior woman and the visual effects etc were fab.  Storyline I agree was somewhat lacking but I certainly wasnt bored at all.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJul 9 2015Emma PStaff WriterFeaturedThe set designers have done an incredible job of creating a visual world and the actors do the best they can with dialogue that fills perhaps 1% of the running time. Someone forgot about story nuance and character. Heres a potted version to save you wasting your time Max gets taken prisoner by an empire run by an evil dictator; Max teams up with some women from the evil empire who escape (this bit takes ten minutes tops). Long vehicle chase scene. The End (some people die along the way but you wont care).The absolute worst bit is when you think the film is about to end and then you realise theres a whole chapter to go involving the chase scene in reverse.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJun 23 2015Max TFeaturedI expected big things from this for several reasons not least because Tom Hardy is one of my favorite actors on the planet. Sadly adding this to the media hype left far too much for the movie to do. I love a good action movie but this was honestly hugely OTT and the utterly relentless chaos which ensued for all 120 minutes made me uncomfortable throughout. In turn the plot suffered. Especially as someone who hasnt seen the originals I was completely dumbfounded by the direction of the movie (literally and metaphorically it moves in one direction an then heads back). Disappointed. Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreMay 20 2015UglyGeezerFeaturedIconic.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreMay 18 2015Charly LestermoderatorStaff WriterFeaturedIncredible film - NOT just one for the boys - be totally transported to another world for two and a half hours.  As someone who normally switches off during car chases in films I was gripped by every minute.  Far more than a car chase. Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreMay 18 2015Paul CTastemakerFeaturedPleasantly surprised what good fun escapist and how physical this film is playing to a near full house on a Sunday night. Ok the story is totally daft and a Jeremy Clarkson three tissue fantasy  the vehicles really are the stars.This timeTom Hardy doesnt have a car phone to worry about and reprises Max in an exciting reboot. Charlize Theron brings a fantastic new tough female character to the screen on a par with Ripley  it would be great to see more of her as Imperator with Max. The Beat as Nux was a surprise and worked well adding another fun spin to the story. This film is a fitting tribute to Newtons Laws of Motion and Top Gear so do go along leave your Haynes manual and swarfega at home and have some non-stop mindless fun.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreMay 19 20150 of 1 found helpfulPopcorn PigFeaturedBemused and bewildered by the 5 star reviews of this film. Yeah ok its very stylised and maybe Im not the target audience but the endless vehicle chases and jumpy editing was relentless and boring. While it was quite enjoyable seeing Charlize Theron kick ass to begin with I lost interest in the characters and left half way through. Nothing against action films (in fact looking forward to the next Mission Impossible) but boy has this film been overhypedHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/london/film/mad-max-fury-road,200,madmaxfuryroad48,madmaxfuryroad,timeout
