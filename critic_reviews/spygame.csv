A vehicle for two glamour boys though it is ""Spy Game"" serves up a judicious blend of showy action political intrigue ticking-clock suspense and intramural CIA one-upsmanship for mainstream entertainment. Globe-trotting like the most fondly remembered espionage thrillers of old this selective survey of agency activities from the mid-70s through the early 90s as seen through a mentor-protege relationship has been machine-tooled to a fare-thee-well by director Tony Scott and his team. Snazzy filmmaking topical relevance of CIA and Middle Eastern issues and star pairing which produces Robert Redfords most engaging performance in years should spur solid biz Stateside and perhaps better overseas. Among other things this Universal release plays like a companion piece to Redfords 1975 starrer ""Three Days of the Condor"" in which he played a low-level CIA man who knew too much. This time out the now more rugged-looking thesp plays 30-year agency vet Nathan Muir who on the day in 1991 that hes hanging up his spurs learns that his former recruit and partner Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt) is in big trouble in China with just a day to live before being executed for having been caught trying to sneak someone out of the country. With a presidential visit to Beijing scheduled in a week the CIA anxious to avoid embarrassing publicity appears ready to sacrifice Bishop for his rogue operation. Or so it seems to Muir who gets to spend his final day on the job being grilled by superiors about his relationship with their wayward agent. One might think that after so long on the job Muir would be a secure member of the old boys network but no to the younger execs hes suspiciously old school and a bit impudent to boot. Much of the films fun in fact lies in the myriad ways Muir outwits his questioners who are just looking for reasons to wash their hands of Bishop. As Muir tells his helpful assistant Gladys (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) Noah knew to build the ark before it rained and much of Muirs success both in the field and the office comes from his well-learned practice of keeping one step ahead of everyone else. The brightly written interrogation sessions trigger the yarns three increasingly potent flashbacks. Initial flashback recounts how Muir in Da Nang Vietnam in 1975 engaged sharp-shooting soldier Bishop to assassinate a Vietcong officer. In West Berlin the following year Muir is seen officially recruiting the California kid for the CIA; as Muir expected Bishop quickly proves himself a natural his resourceful spontaneity being perfect for the job. Its in Berlin however that the younger man learns of the often-tragic human consequences of the spy game. Furious over having been ordered at the last second to abandon a man he was trying to bring over from the East and thereby condemning him to certain death Bishop gets a stern lecture from Muir about real politik and the greater good. As Muir tells the tale of his friend intricate games are being played at agency h.q.; agents ransack Muirs office for files he might have hidden Muir sneaks into colleagues quarters to make secret overseas calls about Bishops status and uses subterfuge to obtain classified documents and photographs. This is high-stakes office politics made increasingly amusing as he stays well past normal hours applying his masterly manipulative skills to this emergency at a time when he should be off celebrating his retirement. Third and most significant flashback lands the action in 1985 Beirut where Muir and Bishop are re-teamed to take out a major sponsor of terrorism. Interlude is very absorbing strictly on its own terms as it deftly illustrates the setting up of the hit -- deciding how it will be done making the critical contacts maintaining surveillance of the target as he arrives via speedboat from Cyprus and then lurks around town. Also strongly evoked are the refugee camps and medical centers where Bishop meets Elizabeth Hadley (Catherine McCormack) a British do-gooder aid worker of whom Muir is immediately suspicious. And then there are the inevitable eerie echoes of more recent events as the episodes climactic action involves a suicide bomber and a building that completely collapses upon detonation. Sequence is powerful and sobering but very acceptable and appropriate in context. Dramatically the incident coupled with Muirs exposure of Elizabeths true affiliations and background sends Bishop off the deep end finishing the relationship between the two men. Unlike ""Condor"" which reflected the fashionably anti-establishment paranoia of the period the script by Michael Frost Beckner creator of the hot-button TV series ""The Agency"" and David Arata (""Brokedown Palace"") is not fundamentally anti-CIA per se; Muir whose point of view defines the pictures stance has dedicated his entire life to the agency for a reason one he feels adamant about. On the other hand no one knows the ""game"" better than Muir; he never relinquishes his right to think for himself and does so when the agency is up to no good as in the case of Bishop. Resolution to the framing 1991 story is effected by a gesture of rule-breaking independence driven by an impulse that underlines Muirs dedication to loyalty and additionally suggests that the battle-hardened veteran might be a closet romantic at heart. Redfords role seems tailor-made for him in the way that many of his major starring parts of the 70s and 80s were designed to maximize his assets. As such his Muir is smart skeptical a bit of a smart-ass at times competent without being a show-off and off-handedly attractive. Despite having hit his mid-60s Redfords star luster is undiminished and with his hair and sideburns appearing somewhat longer he actually looks younger in the 70s-set flashbacks. With considerably less screen time and no depth written into his character Pitt cant take Bishop beyond one dimension and so must settle for making him look brash dashing and increasingly burdened by the gravity of his work. A potentially profitable area the script entirely neglects is Muirs personal interest in Bishop Does he see a young version of himself in kid is he trying to shape him in his own image and what does he think about the fact that they look so much alike? Supporting actors are mainly cast for their faces and the attitudes they can quickly convey. Most crucially given their significant time on-camera Stephen Dillane as Muirs chief agency adversary and Larry Bryggman as a more sympathetic inquisitor register extremely well. Scott employs considerable directorial sleight-of-hand to convey a great deal of information in highly economical ways keeps things moving at a pace that doesnt let down for a moment and uses his diverse locations in resourceful ways Morocco stands in for Beirut as well as Vietnam Budapest doubles for 80s-era Berlin and a pharmaceutical company near London completely convinces as the CIA. Contributions by production designer Norris Spencer editor Christian Wagner and lenser Dan Mindel are tops and the driving score by Harry Gregson-Williams effectively mixes in choral and classical motifs when appropriate.

But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

THIS IS A HANDOUT IMAGE. PLEASE VERIFY RIGHTS. Vetern CIA officer Nathan Muir (Robert Redford) and his protege Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt) take cover in a Beirut street in the Universal film Spy Game. HANDOUT. Redfords Game / He has best role in years as senior CIA man mentoring young spy 1 / 1 Back to Gallery SPY GAME Action thriller. Starring Robert Redford and Brad Pitt. Directed by Tony Scott. Written by Michael Frost Beckner and David Arata. (R. 126 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Robert Redford has been around for so long and has diversified his talents to such an extent -- director environmentalist indie film guru -- that one forgets what a strong and persuasive actor he can be. In ""Spy Game"" an action thriller that pairs him with Brad Pitt as senior and junior CIA operatives Redford dazzles in his best role in decades. Nathan Muir just one day shy of retirement is a sly crusty veteran of the international espionage arena. Drained of illusions amused by the world and his place in it -- but tough when it comes to defending his position -- Nathan goes to the wall when a former protege (Pitt) is arrested for espionage by the Chinese and is scheduled to die in 24 hours. At 64 an age when Cary Grant had retired and John Wayne was spoofing himself in ""True Grit"" Redford is the perfect age to play Nathan. Theres a texture a dimension to him now that wasnt there before -- not only in his weather-beaten face and lumpy hands but in the way he holds himself and regards the world; in the way he commits himself to this role and doesnt balk at playing the cynical callous and dishonest aspects of his character. At the start of ""Spy Game"" Nathan is called in by agency suits to offer his knowledge of Tom Bishop (Pitt). In a series of vivid picaresque flashbacks that Tony Scott (""Enemy of the State"") directs with verve and intelligence Nathan takes us to Vietnam Berlin and Beirut to show how he discovered Bishop as a military sharpshooter and mentored him as a spy and assassin before they became estranged. Its up to Nathan to save his life. Bishop has ""gone rogue"" and the agency has little interest in saving him especially with Chinese trade negotiations pending and a presidential tour one week away. Employing the same retinues of wily tricks that he used in the field Nathan decides to outfox his CIA colleagues and engineer Bishops rescue. Although ""Spy Game"" uses the tension surrounding Bishops death sentence to drive the action its really the tale of his education as a spy and his relationship with the older Muir that supply the movies chief interest. Tom and Nathan arent just mentor and protege; theyre buddies theyre father and son theyre each others mirror. The similarity between Redford and Pitt was evident even when Redford directed the younger actor in ""A River Runs Through It"" a decade ago. They look alike with their golden-boy radiance and they each to different degrees have spent their careers trying to work against the limitations of their extraordinary looks. Pitt doesnt deliver as strongly as Redford in ""Spy Game"" and Im not sure whether hes lacking the emotional resources to pull it off or if the part is simply underwritten. Why in the early Vietnam flashback does Tom Bishop take so quickly to the role of assassin and why later in his career does the killing game repel him? What happens in between? Thats not too clear and neither are various plot points or the route by which Tom found himself in a Chinese prison in the first place. These are the defects in a film thats otherwise enormously satisfying and fun to watch. What works beautifully in ""Spy Game"" is the way Redford shows us how Muirs life has been defined by the adrenaline rush of espionage -- how the pursuit of the thrill irrespective of the ethics involved has fueled him and cut him off from personal attachments. One can easily imagine a prequel to the film set 30 years earlier and told by another CIA operative who looks back on the careful grooming that he applied to Muir. All in the name of the spy game.

Its not so pleasant however to see Redfords sensible acting persona mutated by hyper-agitated modern filmmaking. ""Spy Game"" is a fairly interesting -- if almost hopelessly complex -- CIA picture that gets ratcheted to the stratosphere by director Tony Scotts near-romantic infatuation with his own technical abilities. You can more or less forgive him during action sequences even though truly gifted directors know how to shoot even those with restraint. But Scott films every scene no matter how routine as if hes covering the launch of a nuclear missile. Redford plays Nathan Muir a veteran agent who gets drawn into a tense situation during his last day on the job. Years earlier Muir secretly trained a recruit named Bishop (Brad Pitt) after Bishop successfully managed a difficult assassination in Vietnam. It seems that Bishop has now been captured while trying to free an unknown person from a Chinese prison. The ongoing negotiation of a trade agreement between the United States and China threatens to turn his detainment into an international incident. Higher-ups at the agency want Muir to spill his guts about his old apprentice. If it turns out that Bishop isnt worth the trouble theyll let him die in custody instead of trying to rescue him.

"USATODAY.com - Spy Game plays by cool-guy rules Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 11/21/2001 - Updated 0828 AM ET Spy Game plays by cool-guy rules By Mike Clark USA TODAY Robert Redford has just come off a depressingly smug performance in one of the worst films of his career but it isnt Thanksgiving time for nothing. Spy Game ( out of four) launches The Last Castle into its final resting place and its the actors old-pro persona more than the movie itself that reminds us why Redford has been a superstar for more than 30 years. Game is on the high side of the usual zippy slickness from Enemy of the States Tony Scott but Redford makes it more like a slow sip of aged Scotch which happens to be the preferred drink of the retiring CIA operative he plays. As a longtime agency mentor to a sharpshooter-turned-recruit (Brad Pitt) he met in 1975 Vietnam Redford is old school but with a maverick streak he gets to indulge during his last day on the job in 1991. Having apparently gone ""rogue"" Pitt has been caught trying for reasons initially obscure to sneak somebody out of a Chinese prison. His timing doesnt help either as the cocky younger agents in the emerging ""new CIA"" dont want to see a USA/Chinese trade agreement sunk by the messy publicity. With the flexibility that perhaps only pending retirement can bring Redford attempts a elaborate long-distance rescue and (in the movies most entertaining scenes) obfuscates the answer to every question his superiors pummel him with in frequent grill sessions. The Redford-Pitt relationship unreels in short Vietnam and West Berlin flashbacks and a much longer one in 1985 Beirut. Like the movie it is short on obvious emotion but heavy on moral ambiguity as Pitt -- whose underwritten role merely complements ad art of the golden-guy twosome -- comes to reject the everyday downside of a dirty business. In one scene a suicide bomber destroys a Beirut building but its so much in keeping with nasty stuff weve seen take place in previous scenes that it doesnt reverberate with the far more catastrophic events of Sept. 11 as much as one might think. Catherine McCormack as a British aid worker and the actors who play Redfords unforgiving inquisitors have more to play with than Pitt. Because of them Redford doesnt have to carry the show but he essentially does because its so much fun watching him remain so smilingly evasive with hard information when so many are trying to crack him. More than a quarter-century ago Redford played a young CIA employee in Three Days of the Condor. Someday it will make a great living-room double bill with Spy Game -- the actor then and now. If you cant find a copy of Condor you can learn everything you probably need to know about espionage by pairing Spy Game with Spy Kids.

Then there are films such as Spy Game which laser in on that special cultivated sector of the brain your information processors. From the opening moments of Tony Scotts tensely jumpy and data-jangled espionage thriller were assaulted with big important swirls of helicopters-eye camera movement credits that flash like digital Armageddon warnings as well as a logistically showy action ""situation""--Brad Pitt sneaks into a murky Chinese prison--that is laid out with a precision matched only by the utter cryptic nature of its purpose. If youre having fun yet you may just enjoy the rest of ""Spy Game"" which proceeds with the same cool kinetic spirit of communications-age onslaught. The film is brimming with plots counterplots dossiers and sinister corrupt priorities all held together by the telephoto obsidian gloss of Scotts look-ma-no-pauses style. In 1991 Nathan Muir (Robert Redford) a veteran of the Central Intelligence Agency finds himself odd man out. The Cold War has ended and Muirs old-school methods at once fearless and deeply interpersonal have fallen out of favor in the new corporate CIA. Even his look a professorial ensemble of herringbone jacket and sensible specs stands in marked contrast to the dark power suits worn by his bosses. Muir who can barely fight his way past the security checkpoints in his own office is a relic but he has been left behind by a CIA that is swimming in paranoid bureaucracy. In the films view the agency has reduced itself from a bulwark of security to a glorified tool of capitalism. As cowritten by Michael Frost Beckner (creator of the new CIA-set TV series The Agency) and David Arata Spy Game a stylishly moody and jacked-up cloak-and-dagger adventure pulsates with facile geopolitical insight. At the same time the films vision of the CIA--whats right with it and whats wrong with it--has a spark of genuine dramatic interest that overlaps however unintentionally with the urgency of our own current global concerns. On the last day before his retirement Muir learns that Tom Bishop (Pitt) his former protege is trapped in that Chinese prison and that the government doesnt even want him rescued. (It seems that a skirmish could derail the new relationship between America and China--the priority as Muir puts it of ""free trade microchips toaster ovens."") Muir is so far out of the loop that in order to save Bishop he has to coerce his way into a top-security briefing and outwit his superiors right there at the conference table. The hook of the movie and its a good one is that he becomes a spy directly within CIA headquarters tricking and cajoling and manipulating a regime grown bloated with complacency. Muir in essence never leaves the Langley Va. complex yet that doesnt stop Spy Game from leaping around the globe and also back in time--to Vietnam where Muir first encounters Bishop as a rawboned young assassin; to West and East Berlin in 1976 where he trains him in the ways of espionage; and finally to the hellish jagged no-mans-land rubble of Beirut in 1985 where Bishop puts his lessons to use by attempting to have a sheik murdered and where he also leaves those lessons behind by falling into bed with one of his ""assets"" (Catherine McCormack). These extended flashbacks are the heart of the film and theyre anchored by a subtle reversal of expectation. You dont cast Redford and Pitt in the same movie without setting up a major oedipal-dreamboat vibe yet if Muir sees Bishop as a younger version of himself he doesnt need to rein in the recruits rogue-youth ways; on the contrary he teaches him to turn his heart to steel. Few actors besides Pitt could get away with playing such a cuddly cutthroat but Spy Game ultimately belongs to Redford who reinvigorates his nobility by drying it out playing Muir with the subliminal sarcastic squint of an undercover Donald Rumsfeld. Redford has done the aging-knight bit before but this may be the first time that he has used his rugged handsome creases as a key thematic point in his acting. That intricately worn 60ish visage with its robot flicker of a smile seems the result of a lifetime of Muirs holding back--his professional spooks refusal ever to reveal whats going on inside. Spy Game is absorbing enough for a night out yet the film never pretends to be more than a lavishly downbeat popcorn thriller; it ends up skittering over the very issues that lend it a modicum of vitality. Watching the movie I kept wondering what might happen if a Hollywood artist of genuine force and vision like Oliver Stone or Steven Soderbergh dared to craft a global political thriller that took a dramatic look at the way the CIA actually operates and how it now needs to change. The forces of art suspense and patriotism might be joined in a vital and complex embrace. In the meantime a movie like Spy Game with its dark-toned technological efficiency looks a bit timelier than it might have four months ago but also more comforting in its movieness than ever.
