The Tale of Despereaux Dont mess with this mouse | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentThe Tale of Despereaux Dont mess with this mouseTo Stuart Little Ratatouille and that made-in-Canada hamster with a heart of gold Hammy we can add rodent hero Despereaux Trilling the smallest of mice with the biggest of ears.Mini-but-mighty Despereaux (voiced by Matthew Broderick) steps up in The Tale of Despereaux. Based on Kate DiCamillos bestseller the movie opens today.  (SUPPLIED IMAGE)  By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterFri. Dec. 19 2008An animated movie starring the voices of Matthew Broderick Sigourney Weaver Dustin Hoffman and Emma Watson. Directed by Sam Fell and Rob Stevenhagen. 95 minutes. At major theatres. G To Stuart Little Ratatouille and that made-in-Canada hamster with a heart of gold Hammy we can add rodent hero Despereaux Trilling the smallest of mice with the biggest of ears.Hes a rebel with four paws. Born with his eyes open he refuses to cower or scurry.Dressed in a jaunty red cap and wielding a sewing needle rapier Despereaux (voiced by Matthew Broderick) is mesmerized by tales of knights valour and honour all devoured in the palace library when hes supposed to be literally devouring the pages according to the mouse code of conduct.Based on Kate DiCamillos bestselling childrens book The Tale of Despereaux encompasses a trio of stories that awkwardly revolve around Princess Pea (Harry Potters Emma Watson) valiant mouse Despereaux who vows to be her champion; Roscuro a homesick former ships rat who yearns to do the right thing but gets off track; and potato-nosed orphan farm girl Miggery Sow (Tracey Ullman) who dreams of being a princess.Article Continued BelowWere barely past the credits when the queen drops dead plunging face-first into her bowl of soup on the much-vaunted annual soup day in the kingdom of Dor. Her demise was hastened by the shock of seeing Roscuro the rat (Dustin Hoffman who has some experience in the rat department having played Ratso Rizzo in Midnight Cowboy) doing the breast stroke in her potage.The grief-striken king bans soup and rats and the kingdom sinks into a funk.Meanwhile in the fanciful land of Mouseworld (a visually marvellous place) Despereauxs parents are trying to get him to mouse up but to their horror the little fellow strikes up a friendship with Princess Pea. Talking to a human is even worse than refusing to cower.Roscuro who has been hauled down to the slimy subterranean netherworld of Ratworld (think Times Square in the 70s) is yearning for sunlight and gourmet soup.And tubby Miggery does maid duty in the palace and spends her time being generally unlikeable.If you think youre baffled imagine what pint-sized moviegoers will face. Its all too much and far too confusing.Meanwhile Despereaux must pay the price for talking to a human and is banished to Ratworld slowly lowered into the dungeon from a spool of thread by blind mouse Hovis (Christopher Lloyd) a Charon-like character with bulbous cloudy eyes. Captured by the rats Despereaux is tossed into an arena to face a hungry cat surrounded by a huge crowd of jeering chanting rodents. Smaller viewers may find the event far too upsetting. Ditto Ratworld itself where human bones and skulls serve as carriages and bridges.The animation operates on a two-tiered system. Human characters are high-concept like Princess Pea who looks like she was drawn by Modigliani. The mice are classic CGI creatures right down to their fluffy caramel fur each hair distinct and every pink nose glistening. If there is a cuter mouse than Despereaux Ill eat my Beatrix Potter library.But not even a Dumbo-eared mouse with the heart of a lion can save The Tale of Despereaux. The plot is too convoluted and there are too many characters to keep track of even with the lovely voice of Sigourney Weaver trying to keep everything straight as the narrator. In many places the glowing charm of the piece gets smothered by darkness evil and foreboding that will make the smaller set uneasy. Theres too much moralizing and not enough fun.The Middle Ages may have been a nice place to visit but you wouldnt want to live there - even the worlds bravest mouse.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

With the voices of Matthew Broderick Dustin Hoffman Emma Watson and Tracey Ullman. Directed by Sam Fell and Robert Stevenhagen. (G. 94 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Any good childrens film director will tell you that computer animation is a means to an end not a genre in itself. The best animated films in recent years would have been successful as two-dimensional cartoons pencil sketches or acted out with sock puppets. The worst ones throw up a random collage of action and hope that technology will take care of the rest. ""The Tale of Despereaux"" has a few book-to-movie translation problems but the animation augments the story so successfully that its always enjoyable to watch. Even though the movie must have come together in rooms with endless rows of computer servers it never loses its fairy-tale roots. Based on Kate DiCamillos 2003 book the plot is in danger of tripping over ""Ratatouille"" last years superb Pixar film about an epicurean rat who takes the French foodie world by storm. Both films star an outcast rodent protagonist feature cooking themes and take place in Western Europe. But at the core the movies are no more similar than ""The Princess Bride"" and ""Big Night."" ""Ratatouille"" was a complex celebration of the creation of art. ""Despereaux"" is a fable with simple themes. The journey begins in a nameless town with a ""Camelot"" vibe which once celebrated its delicious soup-making traditions but was plunged into darkness when a rat named Roscuro (voiced by Dustin Hoffman) fell into the queens soup and she died of a heart attack. Salvation comes in the form of a mouse named Despereaux (Matthew Broderick) who despite his small size and enormous ears has absolutely no fear. He befriends a princess (Emma Watson) and they work together to lift the aura of gloom. ""Despereaux"" is co-directed by Sam Fell who worked on the underrated ""Flushed Away"" and the movies share some of the same charm. Humor is found in creative places such as the mouse primary schools which teach students to cower and scurry (our hero will do neither). Despereauxs family is equally aghast when instead of eating books he decides to read them. The straightforward story is told with lushly drawn backdrops many of which have the look of really old paper. Directors Fell and Robert Stevenhagen use whatever medium is best to get their point across reverting to two-dimensional animation for one flashback sequence and showing characters on a dungeon wall like a silent movie in another. Theres also a depth of field throughout ""The Tale of Despereaux"" thats reminiscent of skilled hand drawing. This may be the first animated film where you notice the cinematography. Unfortunately ""Despereaux"" is also a 272-page book thats been distilled into a 94-minute movie and there are some narrative casualties in the rewrite. A side plot involving the princess servant girl and a jailer seems thrown in and the rat Roscuro tends to switch allegiances a little too quickly as if a few scenes were edited out. Its also worth noting that despite the G rating the complicated story and darker turns (including rats who ride in human skulls like sedan chairs) will be better for older children than the prekindergarten set. That being said the good fairy tales always do result in improved sales of night-lights. ""The Tale of Despereaux"" may not be a classic but it still has a lot of class. -- Advisory This film contains a few dark themes characters in peril and rodent-related health violations.

In The Tale of Despereaux - the elaborate computer-animated adaptation of Kate DiCamillos Newbury Medal-winning childrens novel - the tiny intrepid rodent is so cute its impossible not to ooh and aww just looking at him. Which is a good thing because youll need something to get you through the long stretches of fairytale pastiche that make up this overwrought yarn about individuality courage grief and forgiveness. With echoes of (in no particular order) Ratatouille Flushed Away Gullivers Travels Shrek and at least a half-dozen Grimms fables The Tale of Despereaux transpires in the kingdom of Dor an island land presided over by a royal clan with a penchant for soup. Yes every year brings a soup festival around in which the royal chef creates an amazing new broth to set the peoples tastebuds atwitter. The aroma wafts up from the palace kitchen into the courtyards and around town. Gastronomic ecstasy ensues. Gastronomic ecstasy that turns tragic with the arrival of Roscuro (the voice of Dustin Hoffman) a scruffy sea rat that inadvertently tumbles into the queens bowl causing her to yelp ""Theres a rat in my soup"" Soon thereafter she dies. The king declares that from now on rats are to be outlawed exterminated and that there will be no more soup. The happy Dorians are plunged into despair. The sun wont shine the land turns gray (a picture of Dorians gray?) the king mopes and his beautiful daughter Princess Pea (Emma Watson) sits sad and alone. Despereaux (Matthew Broderick) a mouse unlike any other - hes unafraid and doesnt know how to scurry or cower - befriends Pea and tries to make things right. But mouse and rat are a big misunderstanding away from forging an alliance while directors Sam Fell and Rob Stevenhagen introduce a sour-minded scullery maid (Tracy Ullman); the respective subterranean environs of Mouseworld and Ratworld; a gladiator arena where a fierce cat reigns supreme; and more plot strands than the storys spools of thread can possibly tie together. (The subtitle of DiCamillos best-seller ""Being the Story of a Mouse a Princess Some Soup and a Spool of Thread."") Inspired less by Timothy Basil Eringbys original book illustrations and more by Brueghel and Vermeer The Tale of Despereaux has a painterly Middle Ages sheen. At times the visual style seems too classy - the cartoon capers of talking vermin at odds with the muted colors and composition. Narrated in an overbearing once-upon-a-time timbre by Sigourney Weaver (""What happens when you make something illegal thats a natural part of the world?"") Despereaux is a little too desperate to be loved. But that mouse Did I say hes cute? The Tale of Despereaux 1/2 (Out of four stars) Directed by Sam Fell and Rob Stevenhagen.

Stars Matthew Broderick and Dustin Hoffman and Emma Watson and Tracy Ullman Delgo Friday December 19 An adventurous teenager rallies his friends to protect their world from war. Stars Matthew Broderick and Dustin Hoffman and Emma Watson and Tracy Ullman (Universal) Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic The Tale of Despereaux talks a good game.It talks and talks and talks. This fairy tale cartoon based on Kate DiCamillos Newbery Medal-winning novel makes for a cluttered static film with images so vivid that the nose of the hero mouse named Despereaux glistens on screen. If only he moved a little more. For a childrens fable this is more interesting than entertaining a movie that lectures rather than delights.The title character doesnt show up for the first 30 minutes. This Tale begins with Roscuro (the voice of Dustin Hoffman) a rat with a thing for soup and not just ratatouille. He visits a kingdom known for its soup tumbles into the queens bowl and gives her such a shock that she dies. Rats are banished. Soup is banished. The king drops into playing his lute and weeping the princess ( Emma Watson) is trapped in his gloom the chefs go into a funk and a pall falls over the Kingdom of Dor. Then this mouse is born with big ears and a different attitude toward life.""He doesnt scurry He doesnt cower""Despereaux (the voice of Matthew Broderick) is banished for not living his life in fear and for reading books hes supposed to be chewing. He vows to live by a code of ""truth justice and honor."" And when he stumbles upon the princess he starts a quest to make her world right again and safe for soup.The best film fairy tales keep it simple and Despereaux goes wrong by ignoring that. We follow the rats plight and Despereauxs inert ""adventure"" but also the whole kingdom-suffers-without-soup plot and the longings and misadventures of a homely milkmaid ( Tracey Ullman) who longs to be a princess herself. Sigourney Weaver narrates and imparts the books many life lessons about bitterness -- ""When your heart breaks it can grow back crooked"" -- about stereotyping (""A rat is a rat. It doesnt really matter where you came from."") and how ""a single act of forgiveness can change everything.""All these lessons and characters and story threads and settings (""Mouseworld"" and ""Ratworld"") mean that theres precious little space in Despereauxs tale for heroism (save for the third act) and humor.Still children may take to this or that character or its gentle ""Tell me a story"" style if they can sit still long enough waiting for something anything interesting to happen.

The Tale of Despereaux (G) Universal (94 min.) Directed by Sam Fell and Robert Stevenhagen. With the voices of Matthew Broderick Dustin Hoffman. Opens Friday at theaters in New Jersey. THREE STARS Are you a man or are you a mouse? Thats a question that Despereaux hears a lot and it really makes him think. He has whiskers and a tail and a fondness for cheese. He knows what hes supposed to answer. But he also loves adventure and swordplay and tales of chivalry. He feels in his heart like a man. But that makes him different in his little world and that makes him dangerous. And so off into the land of men is he exiled. And so begins ""The Tale of Despereaux"" a pleasant adaptation of the charming bestseller by Kate DiCamillo. And before it ends we will have also met a self-loathing rat a grieving king a lonely scrubgirl an eccentric cook and an entire kingdom dedicated to the pleasures of soup. Its a mad mix of ingredients -- almost as complicated as those broths the castle chef is always whipping up -- and it demands a steady but selfless hand. That led to trouble early on when the films first director -- Sylvain Chomet who shot to fame with the eccentric ""The Triplets of Belleville"" -- left the project abruptly. Its finally been brought to the screen though by Sam Fell and Robert Stevenhagen a pair who come out of more conventional animated films. And quite frankly they feel like a compromise choice competent craftsman who can steer the ship without rocking the boat. Rather than bringing their own look to the film theyve borrowed others. And so the scrubgirl looks like she could be Shreks sister; the most villainous rodent resembles the critic from ""Ratatouille."" The princess has the high wide forehead and round eyes of a Tim Burton heroine; a dancing vegetable spirit looks like something from an ad campaign. But even if the film doesnt have its own style DiCamillos still shines through in the judicious narration by Sigourney Weaver and the storys gentle message of courage and forgiveness. And Weavers wise bedtime voice is joined by dozens of well-cast others -- including Matthew Broderick as the heroic mouse and as the tortured rat the original Ratso Rizzo Dustin Hoffman. Their gentle care and attention help fill out this sweet tale. So too do the background artists who have created wonderfully intricate universes for the different rodents to inhabit or veteran composer William Ross who -- thankfully eschewing the usual power ballads and repurposed 80s rock -- has given the movie a lush orchestral score. Some dueling and romance some derring-do and comedy -- and not a bathroom joke or Saturday-morning tie-in to be found. ""The Tale of Despereaux"" may look both a little tired and a little young but dont let that fool you. Even with a dreaded G rating -- that scarlet letter that screams ""baby"" to young sophisticates -- the two 10-year-old boys I took had a good time with it. And so Im happy to admit did I. Ratings note The film contains some scary scenes for the very young. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

Despereaux voiced by Matthew Broderick is a little mouse (hes half the size of other mice) who grows up with Dumbo-size ears. He longs for feats of derring-do even as his elders advise him of the superior strategic option of derring-dont. ""He never cowers"" say his peers. ""We showed him how but . . .

He also discovers he wants to be a sort of 2-inch Errol Flynn. Lucky for him he lives in a fairy-tale town (half-timbered houses a king a princess and er a magical man made of vegetables who has the best soup recipes). But things in the village have been bleak lately. How bleak? Gray clouds block the sun. Food has no taste and the people are relentlessly downbeat. Things have turned positively Scottish. Several other misfits are also around. For the first time since ""Midnight Cowboy"" Dustin Hoffman plays a rat one whose reputation has suffered even for a rat after an accident he caused that resulted in the death of the queen. The king has taken to sitting by himself and playing sad songs on his lute leaving an effect on the kingdom equivalent to Jimmy Carters speech about malaise. Theres also a serving wench a porcine young girl called Mig (Tracey Ullman) who is losing her enthusiasm for fawning over the princess (Emma Watson). Dark thoughts start to steal into the minds of both the rat and the servant girl. Despereauxs tale stands out among recent animated features for its lack of jokiness (even ""Wall-E"" had more shtick) its stately air its timelessness its bruised souls and damaged hopes. A lot of the movie takes place in a dungeon. The sadness that envelops the kingdom isnt a method for the writers to open up a discussion of current events but the result of a miserable series of accidents and misunderstandings among otherwise well-meaning folk. Although the movie based on Kate DiCamillos book and adapted by ""Big"" writer Gary Ross is simple enough for little kids (theres also some peril that makes its G rating questionable) adults will get caught up in the movies sweet sincerity. (Teens on the other hand may be bored.) Even Disney seldom makes movies like this one anymore without pop-culture gags or hit songs. ""The Tale of Despereaux"" is more like Disneys ""Sleeping Beauty"" somber slow and elegant instead of frantic and dazzling. It works like a beloved fairy tale. Despereauxs world is enchanting as well as enchanted. Whats not to like about a fantasyland where the biggest holiday of the year is soup day? THE TALE OF DESPEREAUX Mighty mouse. Running time 87 minutes. Rated G. At the 84th Street the Orpheum the Kips Bay others.

Despite a lustrous look that mimics Flemish masterworks and a pedigreed voice cast this computer-animated fantasy is more ordeal than enchantment. Its heavyhearted aura and lecturing moralistic tone may fly over the head of young sprouts content to sit mindlessly before the screen but more sophisticated kids will quickly grow restless. Matthew Broderick speaks the role of Despereaux a soft-spoken mouse who scandalizes his peers by openly conversing with humans and reading books rather than gnawing on them. Yes we are in a fairy world of twee bland mice. Despereaux lives in the Kingdom of Dor a mystical place with a soup-based economy whose doleful monarch lives in perpetual gloom. His Queen died in a soup-rodent mishap and the grieving King has outlawed soup and rats. This rankles the rat Roscuro (Dustin Hoffman) who wants to leave the darkness of sewers and cellars for the light of the streets above. Meanwhile Despereaux lacking the timidity of his fellow mice forms a friendship with Princess Pea (""Harry Potters"" Emma Watson) a flaxen-haired beauty with the faintly misty spiritual expression often associated with missing contact lenses. Lumpish chambermaid Miggory Sow (Tracey Ullman) envies the princess life of luxury. When Despereauxs trespass into the world of humans is discovered the mice exile him to the dank virulent rat world where he is threatened with death by cat before an arena of bloodthirsty cheese-nibblers. Roscuro plots revenge on the King by provoking resentful Miggory to kidnap the princess. Valiant Despereaux must swing from a spool of thread wield a needle like a swashbuckler and evade snappish mousetraps to save the day. While that may sound like vibrant adventure in summary these episodes hang limp on the clothesline. With two directors and three credited screenwriters this is a clear case of too many cooks spoiling the broth. The film takes significant liberties with the Newbery Medal-winning storybook none of them helpful. The filmmakers add a clumsy framing device to open and close the action clothe the tales animal characters in an act of absurd prudery and invent a new humanoid vegetable creature just to show off their visual effects capabilities. The film comes at you like an armload of pots and kettles clattering down the stairs. The personal tone of voice that distinguished the book is reduced to overexplicit narration by Sigourney Weaver underlining every authorial insight three times in red ink. And the point -- that people of all stations in life find true happiness in the love of their families -- carries a different emphasis when the story is told in visual terms. The moral of this fable seems to be that pretty girls deserve to live in castles and that coarse-featured broad-beamed girls should be happy slopping pigs. Hans Christian Andersens stories were authentically grim and terrifying but its not often you encounter childrens entertainment so glum. THE TALE OF DESPEREAUX  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating G.

Comments click to enlarge The Tale of Despereaux Rated G  2008 Many of the charms of Kate DiCamillos best-selling childrens book are lost in this British animation by Dreamworks alumni Sam Fell (Flushed Away) and Rob Stevenhagen. Matthew Broderick gives voice to the title character an adorable mouse with huge ears and Emma Watson (of the Harry Potter movies) is the kidnapped princess he gallantly rescues who looks like Mia Farrow. The imagery is colorful and artfully rendered but the filmmakers favoring technological wizardry over story have beefed up the narrative with teeming rodent civilizations a seafaring sequence and gladiatorial action pieces. With the voices of Dustin Hoffman Tracey Ullman Kevin Kline Ciaran Hinds and Sigourney Weaver who provides the arch and distracting narration. G 95 min.

By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / December 19 2008 Email| Print| Single Page| | Text size - + Its understandable that the movie with a talking rat running around a Frenchmans kitchen might produce a ""Ratatouille"" hot flash. And certain close-ups of some of the more stoutly drawn humans might make you wonder when ""Shrek"" became the going model for out-of-shape cartoon characters. But ""The Tale of Despereaux"" overcomes enough of what it seems like to be completely enjoyable for what it is a skillfully managed fairy tale about a mouse a rat and fairy tales in general.This tale begins more or less in tragedy. The festive kingdom of Dor turns dour after the queen keels over dead at the sight of a rat in her lunch. The king cancels Soup Day a holiday bigger than Christmas. He banishes rats. The sun refuses to shine. Think Victor Hugos France without the rampant starvation. In Dors recesses and its dungeons the movies ambitions come to life a tale of two rodents who refuse to behave according to the rules of their species and a poor chubby country girl (Tracey Ullman) who refuses to behave according to the rules of hers.Roscuro the rat with Dustin Hoffmans voice wont act like a savage. Despereaux the teeny mouse with big eyes and giant ears who speaks with Matthew Brodericks boyish voice confounds his genteel family and exasperates all of Mouseworld with his thirsts for literacy extroversion and adventure. They both genuinely like humans and find themselves mixed up in separate but interwoven plots to restore Dor and its royal family to their former soup-loving selves. The girl who winds up inside the kingdom wants to be princess.This film has a lot to do and the directors Sam Fell and Robert Stevenhagen and the screenwriter Gary Ross manage to get it all done. They even have time to spare for an excursion to a pig farm and two exuberantly rendered passages with a pot of veggies that magically becomes a farmers market scaramouche named Boldo (Stanley Tucci). Boldo has a melon head cherry eyes garlic bulb joints and a peapod mouth. Children may not understand a word of what he says but Im sure hell inspire a raft of little eaters to play with their food.So much of the design for ""Despereaux"" is so good - not at the Pixar level of visual transcendence (that apparently is hard to do) but a notch beyond the ""Space Chimps"" and ""Madagascars"" of the megaplex. The flotillas of technicians here are truly inspired. There is a cloud of flour bowls of reflectively oily mealworms and stains on a French chefs teeth that bespeak many glasses of Bordeaux and even more packs of Gauloises.The movies handsomeness makes it easier to ignore the occasionally enervating absence of sunlight and the possibility of some troublesome identity politics. Ratworld is a putrid ghetto that pulses with the rhythms of Afro-Arabian percussion and its leader is a long-snouted creature - Botticelli voiced by Ciaran Hinds - who could certainly have played Nosferatu for F.W. Murnau. Mouseworld by contrast is Waltons Mountain. Since neither the rat nor the mouse likes his respective home no harm is done.The blueprint for all this is Kate DiCamillos Newbery Medal-winning book whose subtitle - ""Being the Story of a Mouse a Princess Some Soup and a Spool of Thread"" - deserved some kind of prize in its own right. When the books title showed up on screen during the closing credits the audience cheered. I held my applause for Sigourney Weavers name. Weaver narrates the film and with all due respect to anyone who ever read me a book none of you was quite this effortlessly entrancing. None of you sounded quite this wise. Its as though she were perched on the edge of my bed. Weaver might be perfect for recession-era entertainment.

" The Tale of Despereaux stars the voices of Matthew Broderick Robbie Coltrane Emma Watson - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies  The Tale of Despereaux stars the voices of Matthew Broderick Robbie Coltrane Emma Watson Michael PhillipsTribune critic The chipper cynicism of the ""Shrek"" movies (2.2 billion in grosses worldwide) is a popular commodity indeed because so many cultures share the same fairy tale tropes and enjoy seeing them shot at with a peashooter. The success of those films makes it doubly hard for a more earnest emotional number such as ""The Tale of Despereaux"" to gain traction with a mass audience particularly a mass audience of preteens for whom DreamWorks and Nickelodeon-fed sarcasm is the default approach to everything.The film is a mixed but pretty interesting bag though its G rating may mislead some parents into taking 4- or 5-year-olds to it which could lead to some freakouts. I freaked out momentarily myself when the savage gladiator cat threatened to eat our hero in a scene more appropriate to ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome."" Adapting Kate DiCamillos Newbery Award-winning book the film has some visual distinction and a muted color palette unusual in commercial computer animation. Three worlds coexist in directors Sam Fell and Rob Stevenhagens universe. In the human world the kingdom of Dor all sunlight and optimism have vanished ever since a rat Roscuro landed from a great height in the queens soup leading to her instant fatal heart attack and the rats banishment to the dungeon or Ratworld. Elsewhere in the royal castle in Mouseworld young Despereaux resists all attempts on behalf of his elders to teach him proper mouse behavior scurrying cowering fear of humans that sort of thing.A romantic and a gallant Despereaux befriends the princess but such fraternizing is verboten. As punishment our hero is sent to the dungeon. Much of the film takes place there and a lot of the narrative is grim. Screenwriter Gary Ross who wrote ""Big"" ""Dave"" and ""Pleasantville"" misjudges some of his story flourishes particularly the gladiatorial battles. This underworld is about as cheery as ""Metropolis."" The voice casting lightens the load. Matthew Brodericks Despereaux Dustin Hoffmans Roscuro and Emma Watsons princess offer plenty of feeling and no wisecracking inflections and even Tracey Ullman--voicing the princess slovenly dreamy maid Miggery Sow--keeps her comic instincts in check. Inspired by the black-and-white Timothy Basil Ering drawings of the book the animation creates a world of shadowy menace and melancholy. The king for example is eternally at his lute consoling himself after the death of his wife.""The Tale of Despereaux"" arrives at its ""Gulliver"" moment when the rats have tied up the princess and are about to go all Willard on her. They plan to eat her. To which you can only say Too much Its all in the finesse; ""Ratatouille"" another animated feature involving culinary mastery and rodents had finesse to spare and managed to traverse all sorts of worlds effortlessly worlds fraught with adversity but hosted by a similarly can-do hero. Here the efforts more visible and the intensitys misjudged. I admired the craft more than I loved the results. But ""The Tales of Despereaux"" is still better-than-average animation.mjphillipstribune.comMPAA rating G (all ages admitted).

Aardman alumni Sam Fell and Robert Stevenhagen bring old-fashioned fairy tale dynamics and an inviting fireside warmth to this adaptation of the bestselling childrens book by US author Kate DiCamillo. A lengthy prologue sets the scene where the enquiring mind of ships rat Roscuro (Dustin Hoffman) gets the better of him on Soup Day and he falls into the queens painstakingly concocted broth and causes her to die on the spot. By decree of the king both soup and rats are outlawed which draws a veil of gloom over the land and inadvertently spawns the ugly underground Ratworld. Its up to tiny mouse Despereaux (voiced by Matthew Broderick) to revive the fortunes of this once-picturesque township. Stylistically the film uses brushed pastel tones to reference classical painting the most direct example of which is the Arcimboldo-inspired kitchen helper whose body consists of fruit and vegetables. Also older viewers wont have to rely on another tired barrage of pop-cultural references beat-boxing squirrels or hackneyed Shrekisms and can instead grapple with the films surprisingly complex subtexts ideas of regional conflict unreasonable abuse of the law and political scaremongering. There are a few problems mainly with the narrative which keeps doubling-back on itself to introduce new characters. And while its not animated with the breathless pizazz of a Pixar Despereaux is all the more affecting and dramatically successful for its contemplative pace and measured delivery of information. A lovely film.

Universal Pictures hide caption toggle caption Universal Pictures Medieval Mouse Intrepid Despereaux capably voiced by Matthew Broderick sets out on a quest to save an imperiled princess. Universal Pictures The title character in The Tale Of Despereaux is an almost unbearably cute baby mouse with enormous ears -- and a healthy curiosity about the world. You would think thats a good thing but curiosity can lead to nonconformity and even boldness. And those are just not mouse-y characteristics as Despereaux learns -- or rather doesnt learn -- in school. The teacher holds up a picture of a piece of cheese and there are Ohhhhhs and Ahhhhs and Mmmmms. Then the teacher holds up a picture of a knife and the whole class dives under desks -- and stays there except for our intrepid little hero. ""Despereaux you didnt cower"" says his teacher. ""Its a carving knife Its dangerous."" ""Its beautiful"" says Despereaux. ""Do you have any more?"" Something similar happens when hes taken to the library. The other mice are just hungry but Despereaux is hungry for knowledge. So while they devour pages he devours stories -- about chivalry and courage loyalty and justice. And in short order hes integrating what he learns from books with his life. He pursues in other words a life of the mind. Which is not lets concede the stuff most animated movies are good at animating. Hes not a kung fu mouse or a surfing mouse or a mouse who loves to cook. Hes interested in words and ideas. The filmmakers have given Kate DiCamillos childrens story a velvety array of images much like the ones in the book and capable voices -- Matthew Broderick as Despereaux Dustin Hoffman as a duplicitous rat and Sigourney Weaver as a narrator who keeps prodding the story back to life. But theyre a bit laid-back about plot trudging through a lot of exposition about soup dark days in the kingdom and princess-wannabes before they even get to the hero. Which might make The Tale Of Despereaux a little slow for the very youngest kids -- though the messages it imparts are certainly ones youll want them to hear.

Starring Matthew Broderick Dustin Hoffman Emma Watson Christopher Lloyd Kevin Kline Sigourney Weaver Robbie Coltrane Stanley Tucci Tracey Ullman Frances Conroy William H. Macy Director Sam Fell Robert Stevenhagen Running time 134 Release Opened Dec 19 2008  Editorial Review ""The Tale of Despereaux"" opens with a lovable stowaway rat named Roscuro (Dustin Hoffman) frigate-ing his way to the not-so-enchanted Land of Dor. But the movie has so many subplots its not long before the viewer gets that sinking sensation that narrative bloat will overwhelm the films ballast.The watery ""Despereaux"" is based on the Newbery Medal-winning book by Kate DiCamillo (""Because of Winn-Dixie""). Its a movie that simply has too much of everything except a storytelling technique that grabs kids and makes them forget they have to go to the bathroom. Its a beautiful film but in the end ""Despereaux"" is esthetically charmed but dramatically inert.Why? Too many stories none well told. The setup is simple enough ""Despereauxs"" titular mouse is a big-eared outcast who has been an embarrassment since birth. He refuses to cower; instead he goes to school to learn where hes treated as if hes developmentally disabled. His parents are mortified. The community is outraged. Out he goes.Lest we mislead the reader that theres something straightforward about this film there is also Roscuros story to be told. Hes something of an epicurean rodent who has come to the Land of Dor for the annual unveiling of a new soup. But when Roscuro inadvertently drops into the Queens bowl she drops dead.Heres where we start parting company with ""Despereaux."" Its sad. Not in an elevating or cathartic way but more in a way thats faux-profound. Theres a major striving for grandiosity when you just want to know what the heck is going on.As usual with these animated epics much depends on the vocal performances and its a mixed bag. Matthew Broderick makes Despereaux sound like a white guy from the suburbs; Hoffman is terrific just as he was earlier this year in ""Kung Fu Panda."" None however provides enough buoyancy to get one past the structural sandbar that ""Despereaux"" erects between its audience and any reason to care.-- John Anderson (Dec. 19 2008)Contains moments of peril.

He also is all ears. ABOUT THE MOVIEThe Tale of Despereaux  1/2 out of fourVoices Matthew Broderick Dustin Hoffman Emma Watson Richard Jenkins Robbie ColtraneDirectors Sam Fell and Rob StevenhagenDistributor Universal PicturesRating GRunning time 1 hour 40 minutesOpens Friday nationwide WATCH THE TRAIL By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Cute little Despereaux the lop-eared mouse is just that. To borrow from A Chorus Line his tale can be summed up thusly Looks 9. Originality 5. Since it focuses on mice and rats it invites comparisons with Ratatouille and falls short. Ratatouille is easily the definitive rodent movie should such a thing exist. Despereaux clearly suffers from bad timing. But even if Ratatouille hadnt existed it still wouldnt be as charming as the image of the adorable mouse suggests. The story narrated by Sigourney Weaver is a bit dreary bogged down by repetitive messages. Despereaux (Matthew Broderick) is not only a delightful little critter he also possesses a trait unlike any other mouse bravery. Much is made of how courage is discouraged in his native Mouseworld. The scenes focusing on how he refuses to cower are initially funny and clever. The animation is handsomely rendered but the story based on the award-winning childrens book by Kate DiCamillo meanders. Despereaux Tilling lives in the kingdom of Dor a magical place where everyone enjoys life and feasts happily on tasty bowls of soup. Then one day an accident occurs and a gloom falls over the kingdom. The king grows depressed. Princess Pea (Emma Watson) is filled with longing and the townspeople are weighed down by despair. Despereaux is destined to save the day. Born brave he loves music and books and he dreams of performing virtuous deeds. Though his family and teachers are constantly after him to shrink in fear just as they do Despereaux is too bold and is banished for refusing to obey. He makes friends with a gruff but good-natured rat named Roscuro (an engaging Dustin Hoffman). But each is hampered by how they are regarded Mice are cute rats are disgusting. Despereaux befriends the princess while Roscuro frightens her. Their lives intertwine with Botticelli (Ciaran Hinds) the despotic ruler of rats and with Miggory Sow (Tracey Ullman) a serving girl who dreams of being a princess. The impressive voice cast includes William H. Macy as Despereauxs timid father Frank Langella as the mayor and Kevin Kline as Andre the royal chef. While the story does not quite come to magical life the themes of courage hope and decency are sweetly inspiring.

The screen glows with Renaissance golds mice dressed like serfs and a princess with Botticelli hair draped over a permanently foreshortened face. Too bad the storys such a mess. As Despereaux (Matthew Broderick) tries to foil a royal kidnapping his tale snags on loose-knit subplots about a seafaring rat (Dustin Hoffman) and a kingdom-wide obsession with soup. The latter involving a snooty French chef and visions of floating veggies gives the movie a whiff of leftover Ratatouille.

Absolutely. Based on the novel by Kate DiCamillo The Tale of Despereaux gathers a host of vocal talent for a relatively complicated story of heroism and loyalty requiring that its young audience pay attention and is all the more rewarding for it (for kids and grown-ups). There are three worlds here the Kingdom of Dor known for its soup; Mouseworld where the timid mice live; and Ratworld a dark ugly place inhabited by rats. We begin in Dor where the annual making of the soup or some such a holiday venerated about Christmas is under way. Roscuro (voice of Dustin Hoffman) a rat who sails the high seas cant control himself around the aromas. His soup lust lands him in hot . . . soup leading to tragedy for the kingdom. Soon both soup and rats are banned in Dor. The skies dry up and colors fade leaving the place drab and gray. On the lam Roscuro winds up underground in Ratworld ruled more or less by the scary Botticelli (Ciaran Hinds) clearly modeled on Max Schreks Count Orlok in the 1922 version of Nosferatu (nice touch). Meanwhile in Mouseworld a strange baby is born. Despereaux (Matthew Broderick) is tiny but he has big ears and big eyes and doesnt cower or scurry. Those last two are sources of great consternation to his parents (William H. Macy and Frances Conroy) and his school principal (Richard Jenkins). There is so much to be afraid of the principal tells him. You just need to find it. Meanwhile meanwhile - yes this is the rare kids film that requires two meanwhiles - Princess Pea of Dor (Emily Watson) is sad missing the happiness of the former world when rain fell and soup was served. Her servant Miggery Sow (Tracey Ullman) is jealous and winds up serving slop to a jailer (Robbie Coltrane). Fate brings Despereaux and Roscuro together two rodent knights inspired by the books that Despereaux reads (instead of eating) seeking adventure. Roscuro wants to redeem himself for the trouble he has caused in Dor but Princess Pea will have none of it. Thus Roscuro hardens and seeks revenge. Its a nice twist unusual in a childrens story - a good guy goes bad. Can his honor be salvaged? Is the tiny Despereaux big enough to save the day? The film like the book is an interesting take on finding courage on being yourself. Despereaux while as cute as any little animated mouse ought to be also has a sort of devil-may-care attitude about life curious about everything afraid of nothing. But weve seen that sort of theme played out in movies before. The added spice of Roscuros journey gives The Tale of Despereaux a darker richer flavor (werent we speaking of soup?).

The five interwoven narratives in this visceral but disciplined and beautifully acted movie show to devastating effect how ordinary men and women -- and especially vulnerable boys desperate for masculine role models -- get caught up in the seductive violence and are ruthlessly destroyed by the networks hardened henchmen. Its hard to tell whether the movie exaggerates the Mafias reach deep into and pollution of the infrastructure of everyday life laying the groundwork for guerrilla-style civil war. Given Gomorrahs arch referencing of the brutality in Coppolas Godfather trilogy I could wish Garrone were a little less excited himself by the brutality he stretches over 136 long minutes. And if he too like author Roberto Saviano (upon whose best-selling expose the film is based) is forced to leave Italy for fear of mob reprisal will he be denied entrance to the United States on the grounds that one of the Camorras real-life business ventures is helping to underwrite the rebuilding of the Twin Towers in New York? (Sunset 5) (Ella Taylor) A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - MY NAME IS BRUCE If your ears perk up at the mere mention of a fourth Evil Dead movie or you tune in to Burn Notice just for co-star Bruce Campbell then My Name Is Bruce was made precisely with you in mind. A cult B-movie legend to throngs of fanboys who love sardonic zingers delivered with hammed-up machismo Campbell takes it on the chin as director and meta-star of this juvenile horror/comedy a self-serving tribute thinly veiled in self-deprecation. Campbell plays himself as a pompous washed-up oaf who lives in a desert trailer regularly drunk-dials his ex-wife and laments taking degrading roles like Cave Alien 2 albeit in a universe where characters quote his old catch phrases and reference his straight-to-video dreck as punch lines. Mistaken for the hero he plays onscreen Campbell is kidnapped one night by a goth teen (and superfan naturally) in the hopes that hell save the kids podunk town from Guan-di the glowing-eyed Chinese god of war and bean curd who has been accidentally resurrected. With a high-camp villain that seems to have escaped from Bubba Ho-tep slapstick scares a la Evil Dead and Ted Raimi playing three different roles the only things missing from this unfunny Campbell love fest are a passable script Sam Raimis inventiveness and a level of sophistication beyond nose-picking and ass grabs. (Nuart) (Aaron Hillis)RAB NE BANA DI JODI Working with actor Shah Rukh Khan in the 1995 record-breaker Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (Braveheart Wins the Bride) writer director and latter-day production executive Aditya Chopra re-imagined the Hindi movie hero as an obstreperous romantic tunefully refusing to take no for an answer. In Chopras new Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (A Match Made by God) SRK again stubbornly lays siege to the affections of a woman who is (for forms sake) temporarily hesitant this time cast not as a strapping student but as a mousey milquetoast of a functionary for the Punjab Power Company who with his pursed lips and fussy cleanliness hopes to win love through small gestures of affection. The other twist here is that as the movie opens Khans Surinder Sahni is already married to his idol Taani (Anushka Sharma) a match arranged on his deathbed by her father Surinders revered former teacher. ""I can never love you"" Taani tells Surinder sadly on their wedding day and no Shah Rukh Khan character worth his salt is going to take that one lying down. When Taani admits shes always wanted to learn to dance and Surinder happily agrees the way ahead seems clear Ever since Astaire and Rogers smooth footwork has been the ideal medium of movie-musical courtship. (Newcomer Sharma turns out to be a charming comedic sparring partner and also a fabulous hoofer.) RNBDJ in fact always seems to be right on the verge of blossoming into a classic but while no actor on Earth could gaze at a woman and lip-synch a line like ""Tujh Mein Rab Dikhta Hai"" (""I See My God in You"") with as much conviction as King Khan the romantic declarations feel too grandiose for this modest-spirited movie. The only character sensible enough to offer a word of demurral (""We are human beings only yaar not gods"") is a comic relief barber big-hearted Bobby Khosla (Vinay Pathak) who snips off Surinders moustache and gels his hair into a leaning tower in a nod to the loopiest of all Bolly-cinema conventions the Double Role. With the help of his impenetrable disguise Surinder approaches Taani on the dance floor as Raj exactly the sort of wild and crazy Punjabi guy a mild-mannered bureaucrat would envision as his polar opposite. The impersonation is set up with a wink and a clever twist but its consequences are psychologically incoherent. As Bobby cogently observes Raj wouldnt seem so real to Taani if he hadnt been in there somewhere all along. So why does the movie endorse the disappointing view that only the muffled nerdy version of Surinder is authentic and lovable? In effect the oppressed Taani is allowed to open up but the repressed Surinder is not which hardly seems fair.

Sep. 13 600pm THE TALE OF DESPEREAUX Kate DiCamillos 2003 childrens novel about a big-eared mouse with an inspiring case of shining-knight envy is one of the finest expositions of loss grief reactive vengeance and forgiveness for kids. I was looking forward to seeing what Sylvain Chomet who made the fabulously weird The Triplets of Belleville would bring to this great yarn which trusts small children enough to understand the concept of mixed motives and empathize with hurt rats who hurt in return. Alas for murky reasons Chomet was bounced from the project shortly after it was green-lit; only his production designer Evgeni Tomov remained. So The Tale of Despereaux looks good in a washed-out Flemish-masters sort of way. Otherwise screenwriter Gary Ross who made the cornball Seabiscuit and directors Sam Fell and Rob Stevenhagen have seen fit to turn this delightful tale into of all things an intermittently vicious CGI action movie in which the mouse (voiced by Matthew Broderick) who refuses to cower gets dumped down a well into a dungeon and shoved into a terrifying gladiatorial battle with a gruesomely drawn cat before he can even start saving the world from darkness and gloom. Clumsily wedged in like a TV commercial between deafening stunts the emotional storytelling sinks without a trace leaving you with only one flawed character to cling to -- a morally challenged Cabbage-Patch-like servant (wittily voiced by Tracey Ullman) who learns that every girl is somebodys princess. (Citywide) (Ella Taylor)TUNNEL RATS Changes in the German tax laws have changed the way that infamous director Uwe Boll (BloodRayne Alone in the Dark) does business. No longer able to rely on tax write-offs to raise capital hes been forced to go back to basics ... and against all odds this approach seems to be working. Tunnel Rats not based on a video game not featuring crappy CG effects and not featuring big-name actors in ridiculously miscast roles (Michael Pare is the closest thing to a familiar face) is easily Bolls best film to date. Admittedly in some quarters ""best Boll film"" is a phrase roughly akin to ""least unpleasant diaper change"" but Tunnel Rats really does evince some actual talent. A Vietnam war movie focused primarily on the underground tunnels dug by the Viet Cong -- and the unfortunately naive American troops who found themselves fighting inside said passageways -- its an effectively shot ultraviolent ultranihilistic moderately claustrophobic vision seemingly inspired equally by We Were Soldiers and The Descent. Only when the soldiers open their mouths and engage in overly accented casual conversation does the Boll badness factor become evident; this however is rare enough to give one an actual sliver of hope for the eight other films that the Notorious U.W.E. apparently has on his slate for the next two years. (Downtown Independent) (Luke Y. Thompson)WHERE GOD LEFT HIS SHOES Undercard boxer Frank Diaz (John Leguizamo) is a ring slickster whose lack of jaw and heart has kept his looks while eroding his self-worth. Hes supporting a family on one of those ""one paycheck away from the street"" budgets when that one paycheck doesnt come. From here Where God Left His Shoes overlaps with classics of hapless patheticism a little Bicycle Thief a little ""no room at the inn."" The films body takes place on Christmas Eve as Frank drags his preadolescent stepson (David Castro) under turnstiles borough to borough trying against deadline to find a job that will satisfy the familys application for a new apartment. Leguizamo working at a scramble gets more onscreen traction than in recent memory; the father-son rapport is bullyish-fraternal including raunch ribbing about girls and schoolyard sex-ed (""You cant go raw-dog these days""). Director Salvatore Stabile a Brooklyn native with a resume in TV production knows how to line up a permit and scout out perfect South Brooklyn Italian manors and melancholic intersections. He gets interesting scenes too -- a Halloween eviction the backing down of a suspiciously kid-friendly cot-jockey at the homeless shelter -- though the movies verite is diluted by a cozy adult-contemporary empathy with those less fortunate which left me hearing ""Another Day in Paradise."" (Grande 4-Plex) (Nick Pinkerton)GO  THE YELLOW HANDKERCHIEF Director Udayan Prasads post-Katrina road movie is not a remake of Yoji Yamadas 1977 winner of the first-ever Japanese Academy Award for Best Picture nor is it tied as tightly to Tony Orlandos oak tree as it is to ""Going Home"" the Pete Hamill short story that inspired all of the above. (Of course Hamill stole from folklore so go stare at the sun aint nothing new under it.) Affecting in his muted mien of regret William Hurt plays a freshly paroled Louisiana ex-con with a history of violence -- as Maria Bello can attest in parallel flashbacks -- who hitches a lift and briefly becomes a father figure to a makeshift family of self-perceived misfits. Behind the wheel is a socially retarded redneck eccentric (Savage Graces Eddie Redmayne) with a dire need for Ritalin and a hard-on for the other drifter a too-trusting teen romantic (Twilights Kristen Stewart) with daddy issues and an awkward surge of budding sexuality. Its the mismatched-ensemble-together-in-loneliness formula that Sundance dreams are made of and the predictables add up that title image signaling hope from afar; a run-in with the po-po and occasionally the next line of dialogue. Still Hurts revealed criminal past couldve been cringe-worthy and its not. All three leads are solidly convincing in their candor. And Oscar-winning cinematographer Chris Menges (The Mission) shoots the hell out of the swampy South to make for a nontoxic diversion. (Town Center 5) (Aaron Hillis) YES MAN Not the Liar Liar sequel it looks like in the trailer but close enough Jim Carrey plays a self-absorbed Debbie Downer named Carl Allen who green-lights every bad decision in an effort to reinvent his sorry life. And hey it works Really well because his first terrible decision -- to give a homeless man all his money -- turns out to be a stroke of good fortune as Carl is rescued by perky spontaneous Allison (Zooey Deschanel) a singer in an avant-rock band called Munchausen by Proxy and the instructor of a jogging-photography class. How quirky Theirs quickly blossoms into a romance defined by its random acts of wackiness including a flight to Lincoln Nebraska ... just because its there. Inevitably Carl winds up in the stands of a Nebraska-Oklahoma football game his body covered in red and white paint. See what saying ""yes"" to anything will get you? Turns a 46-year-old man into a frat boy. (See also Will Ferrell.) After Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and even 2005s Fun With Dick and Jane remake Carrey seemed destined for far more grown-up roles; hed transitioned from the slap-shticky surreal to the unexpectedly real. But Yes Man is nothing more than warmed-over holiday seconds a repackaged best-of for those who already own the hits.

"Tale of Despereaux The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; tale-of-despereaux-the ) Tale of Despereaux The (United Kingdom/United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli As animated films go The Tale of Despereaux represents adequate family entertainment. The quality is nowhere near the level we have come to expect from Pixar but since there are no Pixar films in theaters this time of year The Tale of Despereaux makes an acceptable substitution. Its on par or perhaps a little better than Dreamworks cash-grab Madagascar 2. Nevertheless this is not top-flight animation. While the voice acting is fine and the story is nicely paced the visuals are disappointing. The Tale of Despereaux looks like it was made about 10 years ago and at a time when even mediocre animated films can generally boast a stunning look this movies uninspired animation is a source of disappointment. The Tale of Despereaux focuses on four characters whose paths cross and whose lives intersect Despereaux (voice of Matthew Broderick) the courageous mouse; Roscuro (Dustin Hoffman) the cultured rat; Princess Pea (Emma Watson) the lonely daughter of the citys ruler; and Miggery Sow (Tracey Ullman) the servant who dreams of wearing her mistress tiara. After being banished from Mouseworld for showing un-mouse-like tendencies (such as not cowering intentionally tripping mouse traps and speaking to humans) Despereaux decides to embark upon a quest as the Princess champion and restore sunlight and beauty to a kingdom that has become trapped in grayness. He is joined in this endeavor by an unlikely ally Roscuro the rodent inadvertently responsible for the societys current malaise. But the Princess is given more to worry about than the endlessly dreary days when Miggery hatches a personal plot against her. The animation in The Tale of Despereaux is well below the bar set by 2008s earlier efforts WALLE and Madagascar 2. Although there are some cleverly designed sequences that intentionally use two-dimensional cartoonish images to give life to the stories of chivalry read by Despereaux the majority of The Tale of Despereauxs visuals are plain and lacking in detail. The backgrounds are devoid of the richness of texture we have come to expect from computer animated movies. Kids probably wont mind - its not as if the animation is awful and its light years better than anything found on TV - but discerning adults may be disappointed by what appears to be a step backward. The strength of the vocal casting mollifies to a degree complaints about the films look. The filmmakers Sam Fell (Flushed Away) and longtime animator Robert Stevenhagen have chosen a group of well-respected character actors to voice their human and animal creations. With the possible exception of Frank Langella (whose gravelly bass is unmistakable) as the rat mayor none of the actors have distinctive voices which means that the characters are allowed to exist on their own without being overwhelmed by the actor speaking their words. Matthew Broderick Dustin Hoffman Emma Watson vocal chameleon Tracey Ullman Kevin Kline William H. Macy and Stanley Tucci all contribute. Sigourney Weaver is easily recognizable but her only function is to narrate so its not an issue. For a family movie The Tale of Despereaux has a surprisingly complex plot with the story beginning aboard a ship then shifting from Mouseworld to Ratworld to the inside of a kitchen within the human castle to a pig farm to a the tower where the lonely princess resides. The transitions are effectively constructed allowing the movie to flow from one location to the next as it switches from character to character. There are satirical elements especially within the mouse society where attributes associated with cowardice are viewed as desirable and an overall moral about the virtue of forgiveness. The ending is abrupt but as with the animation this isnt something that will upset younger viewers. I have often discussed the difference between a kids film - a movie that is so tightly focused toward children that older viewers may have difficulty enduring it - and a family film - which blends simplicity and sophistication in a way that broadens its cross-generational appeal. The Tale of Despereaux skews toward the former category. The film raises an interesting question though Why are rats the bringers of the Black Plague and one of the most detested urban pests suddenly so popular as the heroes of animated films? Then again the cuddly denizens of Flushed Away Ratatouille and The Tale of Despereaux dont resemble their real-life counterparts. If they did children might not be so charmed by their antics in the animated arena.

Kate DiCamillos delectable novel about rodents royals and the restorative properties of soup gets the star-laden CG-animated bigscreen treatment in ""The Tale of Despereaux."" Nobly striving to realize the source materials many intricacies and chronological shifts this graphically well-rendered kidpic is less crass and mouthy than many recent feature-length toons but also more sluggish and ungainly as it tries to approximate DiCamillos singularly delicate tone. Drawn by a name-heavy voice cast family auds should lap up the Universal release in healthy but hardly ""Ratatouille""-sized numbers. Ancillary biz looks tasty. DiCamillos 2004 Newbery Medal winner tells the story of a valiant mouse a vengeful rat an ill-treated servant girl and the beautiful princess who in different ways transfixed them all. The novel was written in a hushed almost incantatory prose style with a tender direct address to the reader that allowed the authors moral insights -- about the virtues of nonconformity the power of storytelling and the universal need for forgiveness and redemption -- to sink in without condescension. Yet condescension ends up creeping into the screenplay by ""Pleasantville"" and ""Seabiscuit"" director Gary Ross (with screen story credited to Will McRobb and Chris Viscardi) due to lecturesome voiceover narration (by Sigourney Weaver) that spells out every last nuance as the film proceeds along its multiple parallel threads. The first of these threads concerns the rat Roscuro (voiced by Dustin Hoffman) who arrives in the kingdom of Dor in time for the unveiling of the castle cooks latest concoction. Soup is a big deal in Dor -- at least until hungry Roscuro accidentally falls from a chandelier and lands in the queens bowl the shock of which hastens Her Majestys death and impels the heartbroken king to issue a royal ban on soup and rats. In a different timeframe deep within the castles walls a runty little mouse named Despereaux Tilling (Matthew Broderick) is born. Mentally as well as physically Despereaux is different from other mice Hes brave literate and deeply curious about the human world and the pic spends too much time on comic-psychobabble sequences of Despereauxs parents worriedly discussing their sons rebellious tendencies (""He never cowers""). One of the rules of this storybook realm is that mice rats and humans speak the same language so its not long before Despereaux forges a heartfelt bond with the lovely grief-stricken Princess Pea (Emma Watson) -- an unspeakable transgression in the mouse world for which he is banished to the dungeon to be preyed upon by fearsome rats. There he crosses paths with Roscuro whos tormented by his inadvertent role in the queens death and plump freckled Miggery Sow (Tracey Ullman) a lowly scullery maid as unattractive as her name. In keeping with the novel with its free-flowing compassion for all creatures great and small the characters here are fuller and more complicated than one would expect. Roscuro is unusually introspective for a rat (as in ""Kung Fu Panda"" Hoffman delivers the toons standout vocal turn) and his guilt ultimately leads him on a twisted quest for revenge that endangers the princess -- and calls forth Despereauxs inner hero. Visually these critters hew closer to subdued 3-D photorealism than the more colorful cartoonish style of say the ""Madagascar"" franchise. Action is confined almost entirely to the castle elegantly detailed by production designer Evgeni Tomov and lensed with an emphasis on moody grays and browns by Brad Blackbourn. While beautiful enough to look at (and nicely supported by William Ross score) the film feels emotionally muted as a result and often turns downright laborious as it tries to shift gracefully from one character strand to the next. As if to compensate helmers Sam Fell (""Flushed Away"") and Rob Stevenhagen crank up the action elsewhere. Among their innovations are the lively kitchen sequences in which a strikingly designed culinary spirit composed entirely of fresh produce inspires the cooks soup recipes. Less successful are the gladiatorial bloodsports held in the rats underground lair -- which though hardly violent enough to call the G rating into question are sufficiently unpleasant to suggest that DiCamillo avoided describing such horrors for a reason.
