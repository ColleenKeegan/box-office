"Review Coraline is glorious and deep - CNN.com Share this on Mixx Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon Review Coraline is glorious and deepStory Highlights ""Coraline"" makes the most of its 3-D -- and its clever creative storytelling Movie is based on Neil Gaiman story about girl who finds new set of parents ""Coraline"" is intense but also whimsical and wonderful Next Article in Entertainment >> By Tom Charity Special to CNN (CNN) -- There is a lot of excitement around the potential of ""stereoscopic"" movies (""3-D"" to you and me). Much of it has been drummed up by director James Camerons forthcoming blockbuster ""Avatar"" and Dreamworks boss Jeffery Katzenberg who is releasing more than a dozen 3-D pictures this year. The title character looks over a note from her ""other parents"" in ""Coraline."" After seeing ""Beowulf"" and ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" two recent entries in the 3-D sweepstakes it was easy to conclude that this fad wouldnt last any longer than it did last time around in the 1950s. But after seeing the captivating ""Coraline"" the first stereoscopic stop-motion animated feature Ive changed my mind. Maybe this really is the next phase for motion pictures -- and whats more maybe thats not such a bad thing. In the hands of ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" director Henry Selick 3-D isnt a gimmick or the ocular equivalent of an obstacle course. Its an aesthetic enhancement layering the story and literally bringing depth and texture to the visuals. Adapted by Selick from Neil Gaimans novella (the same Neil Gaiman who co-scripted ""Beowulf"" incidentally) ""Coraline"" is a contemporary fairy tale about a bored blue-haired 11-year-old kicking around a big old house in rainy empty Oregon. Her parents are writers. They basically leave her to her own devices so when Coraline (voiced by Dakota Fanning) discovers a diminutive door hidden behind the wallpaper her mom (Teri Hatcher) agrees to fish out the key revealing ... a brick wall. Its only at night when she dreams that the door magically opens to a tunnel and Coraline passes through to the house next door a fabulous mirror image of her own home right down to an identical mom and dad. Identical except that these parents give her pancakes presents and their full attention. That and the buttons stitched into their skulls where their eyes should be. Any parent will immediately recognize that this ""other mother"" and ""other father"" are too good to be true (theyre prettier and more talented and they obviously dont work for a living) but Coraline is entranced by the dazzling super-saturated night-world with its garden of snapping dragons a circus of performing mice and all the treats she can eat. In her dreams the grass isnt just greener -- its emerald. In one of Selicks embellishments on the novel theres a facsimile of the only other child in the valley. Hes an irritating boy named Wybie whos very much improved in his all-smiling mute incarnation in Coralines opinion. At least until he musters up a scowl ... Selicks movie can be intense and even disturbing; it could easily freak out impressionable adults let alone their offspring. But I prefer to think of it as a feel-good movie for overworked parents. Theres also a redoubtable talking cat (voiced by Keith David) to ensure that everything will come out all right. Tapping into primal fantasies and fears the film also echoes classic fantasy stories from the Brothers Grimm Lewis Carroll and L. Frank Baum. The tunnel suggests the rabbit hole Alice fell down and the crazy mirror manner in which the ""other"" world reflects back on reality reminds us of the doubling of actors in the film version of Oz. ""Coraline"" isnt perfect. I could have done without either the downstairs neighbors -- two elderly showgirls -- or the acrobatic Russian barker upstairs (a little carny goes a long way). But the whimsy is always offset with comic mischief and the menace of Hatchers genuinely creepy Other Mother. The model work is extraordinary in its eccentric jury-rigged genius. A shower spouts rusty water -- fabricated from plastic apparently. And if you examine the blooms in Other Fathers garden too closely you might see they have been fashioned from popcorn. You cant taste it -- not yet -- but in its 3-D incarnation (about half the movies release prints will be in traditional 2-D) youll feel you could reach out and touch. With an dreamily sinister and seductive score by Bruno Coulais ""Coraline"" never stops taking artistic risks. I hope theres a brave enough audience out there willing to take the plunge. ""Coraline"" runs 100 minutes and is rated PG. For Entertainment Weeklys take click here.

Sprung from the fertile imagination of Neil Gaiman the king of hip fantasy and graphic lit ""Coraline"" captivates with its rich Gothic atmosphere eccentric characters and Alice in Wonderland storytelling roots.Although a bit scary for tiny tykes everyone else will hoist this macabre tale atop that cartoon shelf normally reserved for Pixar films.Like the best animated movies ""Coraline"" never sacrifices story for technical gee-whizzedness. Given the insufferable hype swirling around the films souped-up 3-D technology -- the first time 3-Ds been used with a stop-motion animation film -- thats surprising.3-D has become the new black in Hollywood with some movies wearing it elegantly and others a little crassly. Where the recent ""My Bloody Valentine"" remake made us duck from projectile eyeballs and pick-axes ""Coraline"" buzzes us with agitated hummingbirds and leaping Scottish terriers.

If the 3-D had been scrapped ""Coraline"" still would be remarkable; ""Bloody Valentine"" not so much.Gaiman and screenwriter/director Henry Selick (""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and the underrated ""James and the Giant Peach"") along with a small nation of stop-motion animation wizards have painstakingly created an ambitious and marvelously detailed world.Advertisement The filmmakers seamlessly transport us into the restless mind-set of a strong-willed 11-year-old girl (voiced by Dakota Fanning) a protagonist none too happy after her family relocates to a dreary rundown rental house in Oregon. Her self-absorbed workaholic writer parents (voiced by Teri Hatcher and John Hodgman) consider her an inconvenience so bored Coraline sets out to explore on her own.Along the way she encounters a mangy cat a nerdy boy and a trio of quirky retired carnival stars who are also residents of her Pink Palace rental home. One day Coraline stumbles upon a secret tunnel that leads her to an alternative reality where she can get whatever she desires. Or so she thinks.The mirror world turns out to be a nightmare -- one spooky enough to freak out kids who had a rough go with ""Snow White.""The wicked turn in plot presents the voice cast with a chance to ham it up. Hatcher (of ""Desperate Housewives"") is a standout both loving and frightening as real Momma and alterna-Momma. BBC stars Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French are hilarious as the voices of the well-egoed and retired grand-dame actresses who are Coralines neighbors. But truly all involved in this production deserve praise for turning ""Coraline"" into a triumph of storytelling and cinematic technology.

When inquisitive pre-teen Coraline discovers a secret door in her family home she stumbles into a universe of apparent perfection - and underlying danger.The films biggest draw has to be its intricate visuals particularly in 3D. Selick plays with expectations superbly presenting a drab grey-hued world which slowly transforms into a dazzling phantasmagoria of talking cats flying trapezes and a uniquely terrifying villain. This dark edge will be the biggest test of the film as a commercial prospect it may be too terrifying for the target audience.

"Coraline | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; coraline ) Coraline (United States 2009) February 06 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli Henry Selick has a particular sensibility and when choosing material for his movies he seeks stories that fit into the slightly twisted quasi-fairy tale realm where he feels comfortable working. Thus in the past he has collaborated with Tim Burton and adapted Roald Dahl. Coraline his fourth feature film uses a short book by Neil Gaiman as its inspiration. Employing stop-motion animation that renders human beings with the distinctive characteristics evident in both The Nightmare Before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach Selick finds the perfect look to bring Gaimans vision to life. The resulting tale may owe a little to ""Hansel and Gretel"" and ""Alice in Wonderland"" but ultimately stands on its own. Its a mark of any good 3D movie that it can be watched and enjoyed on its own merits when projected in 2D and thats the case here. In fact the 3D effects are in many cases subtle enough that its questionable whether the benefits of seeing the movie in 3D are worth the drawbacks (limited availability a dimmer picture more expensive tickets and uncomfortable glasses). Coraline does not employ an ""in your face"" approach to 3D. It uses the tool to provide a sense of greater depth but rarely do things pop off the screen (except during the climax). Theres nothing in this film that demands that it be watched in 3D. The movie tells the story of a blue-haired young girl by the name of Coraline Jones (voice of Dakota Fanning) who has moved to an out-of-the-way 150-year old mansion in Oregon. Unlike the usual animated heroine shes not sugar and spice and everything nice; Coraline has a nasty side that peeks through at times (most notably in her treatment of others). Her mother (Teri Hatcher) and father (John Hodgman) are writers with little time for their daughter so Coraline is left on her own to explore the house and its grounds. She meets the next-door neighbor Wybie Lovat (Robert Bailey Jr.) and his cat; the strange ""sisters"" (Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French) living on the lower level of the 3-apartment mansion; and the ""circus man"" Mr. Bobinsky (Ian McShane) living on the upper storey. One day Coraline discovers a hidden door that appears to lead nowhere; the opening has been bricked up. That night however a portal opens behind the door that transports Coraline to a strange world of unsuspected wonders where her ""Other Mother"" and ""Other Father"" are interested in only pleasing her and things are warm beautiful and colorful. But the time-honored clichA(c) applies If it looks too good to be true it probably is. Selicks animated style is almost smooth enough to be mistaken for CGI but theres a texture to the approach that betrays it as being a little more labor intensive (watch the cats fur especially in its first scene). Kids likely wont notice the difference but adults will appreciate that the movie doesnt feel like a generic clone of the animated product that studios are pumping out with regularity. Selicks bizarre streak is given ample opportunity to be on display. His tendencies to favor gothic backdrops and to develop his characters in such a way that they look like they have emerged from an Edward Gorey illustration makes the film potentially intense for young nightmare-prone children. This is the basis for the PG (not G) rating. The plot is interesting enough to involve viewers of all ages. Despite the incorporation of familiar elements it provides some surprises and the narrative trajectory is not predictable from start to finish. The vocal characterizations mostly provided by actors without distinctive voices are strong. Dakota Fanning makes the young heroine instantly likeable and Teri Hatcher has no difficulty with aspects of her role that force her into Wicked Witch territory. Selick may have incorporated a little of Fanning and Hatchers looks into their animated counterparts although nothing is overt. Like all effective fables Coraline isnt only for children although it would I suspect work as a bed-time story. One of my biggest problems with many animated movies is that they are pitched at an intellectual level below me but I didnt feel that way about Coraline. The film has been crafted with a consideration that the best family movies appeal not only to a young target audience but to the parents who accompany their offspring to theaters. And while the 3D experience may make Coraline a little more eye-catching it is by no means mandatory for those wishing to enjoy what this visually intriguing production has to offer.

By David Denby Share Tweet Table of Contents Andrzej Wajdas movie tells the story of the Katyn massacre in 1940. Credit Illustration by Tom Bachtell I have been to Poland just once briefly in 1978 to talk about movies but I kept meeting people there who wanted to talk about something else--the Soviet betrayal of their country. In particular they were obsessed with a single event the murder of Polish officers in the Katyn forest near Smolensk in 1940. For many Poles the lies spread about this massacre amounted to a virtual negation of the countrys identity. ""Katyn"" a stunning epic film directed by Andrzej Wajda is an attempt to settle the truth of the affair once and for all. In such films as ""Ashes and Diamonds"" (1958) and ""Man of Iron"" (1981) Wajda whos now eighty-two has dramatized the issues of Polish politics and national destiny and at the beginning of ""Katyn"" he reminds us with onscreen titles of the twin events that turned his countrys fate into a joke between two dictators. On September 1 1939 Hitlers forces invaded Poland; on September 17th the Red Army did too and the country was split into two occupied zones. The Soviets then captured around ten thousand Polish Army officers. What to do with them? Stalin was murderously prescient; he may have anticipated the future of the war--the coming German invasion of the Soviet Union and the Soviet recovery and counterattack which in the event rolled through Eastern Europe--and in that future he had his own plans for Poland. During April and May of 1940 the Soviet secret police the N.K.V.D. shot nearly all the captured officers--many of them reservists who had built careers as engineers doctors and teachers--and dumped their bodies in mass graves in the Katyn forest and at other N.K.V.D. execution sites. At the same time many other Poles held in Soviet custody were also shot. In all more than twenty thousand people were killed. Then came the second betrayal during the long Soviet domination of Poland after the war the crime was officially blamed on the Nazis. Its as if Polands grasp of the truth had been taken away along with its sovereignty. In ""Katyn"" after the opening titles smoke and clouds fill the air and the camera slowly moves through the murk and takes in a bridge filled with people converging from two directions. It is September 1939. A group entering from one end is fleeing the Germans; a group entering from the other is fleeing the Soviets and they mingle in abject confusion. Wajdas movie is based on a novel by Andrzej Mularczyk ""Post-Mortem"" and it manages the feat of telling the story of a nation through typical characters who nevertheless retain their individuality. A captain Andrzej (Artur Zmijewski) held captive by the Soviets says goodbye to his wife; he keeps a diary thereafter which occasionally forms the movies narration but he never fully understands whats happening to him. ""Katyn"" re-creates one of the everyday terrors of living under totalitarianism no one in power ever tells you the truth and you live on rumor and hope. The captains stubborn wife Anna (Maja Ostaszewska) longing for his return goes to live with his parents in Nazi-occupied western Poland. Earlier we had seen the Nazis arrest her father-in-law a professor along with most of the faculty of Krakows Jagiellonian University--all the men middle-aged or even elderly hustled into trucks and taken away without explanation. Wajda goes back and forth between the sudden stunning seizure of large groups of people and the intimate moments of companionship among their families waiting for news--any news. The scenes are curt decisive and unsentimental to the point of bluntness. ""Katyn"" has the severity of an old mans work--forceful plain statement and implication convey all that Wajda wants to say. Once the Red Army kicks the Nazis out of Poland and local Communists backed by the Soviets begin to take over the new society forms itself in part around the Katyn lie perpetrated by the Soviet ""liberators""--a lie enforced by prison for those who will not accept it. It is a situation of excruciating irony at least part of the population agrees to the fiction in order to forestall still worse repression and to save whatever it can of Polands integrity as a nation and a culture. ""There will never be a free Poland"" a bitter woman says. Wajda takes us into the Communist period and only at the very end of the movie as if recalling a nightmare that had been suppressed by everyone does he show us what actually happened in 1940. The officers are shot in a basement one by one with a single bullet through the head or pushed to the edge of a pit and killed there. The scene plays in virtual silence interrupted only by the repeated pistol shots. Before it is over we know that Wajda has made one of the movies most potent evocations of a gruesome twentieth-century ritual; we know as well that only in a free Poland could he have created this particular spectacle. (The Soviets didnt officially admit the truth about Katyn until 1990 as their authority was waning.) Wajda has exorcised feelings that may have burdened him since he was a teen-ager his own father Jakub Wajda a decorated fighter in the First World War was among the officers killed. This tenacious artist has now given his father a proper memorial and has reasserted with power and grace the history and identity of his nearly effaced country. A spindly metal claw like a tarantula made of steel squeezes under a door and comes right at you; hummingbirds hover before your face; a ride on a trapeze becomes a vertiginous swing into the depths. The animated ""Coraline"" seen in its 3-D version now and then uses the third dimension aggressively for nose-biting or swooping but most of the time the writer-director Henry Selick working from Neil Gaimans novel extends his reach into space as a way of increasing mobility and adventure--as a gift to imagination. Theres a lot of barrelling through tunnels and dashing into rooms and some very startling effects such as when the heroine Coraline (voiced by Dakota Fanning) a spunky eleven-year-old girl is walking with an all-knowing cat (Keith David) and both of them are under the control of a witch who suddenly turns everything around them piece by piece into white blankness. All dimensions it seems can be erased. ""Coraline"" is a beautifully designed rather scary answered-prayer story the little girl longs for more attention than shes getting from her parents so she enters a parallel world in which her parents are very attentive indeed--so attentive that they want to take control of her sew buttons into her eyes and turn her into a ghost child. All her neighbors are there too in slightly altered form and the movie is filled with both sinister and enchanting transformations as when the two portly retired British music-hall performers who live in Coralines house burst out of their shells of voluminous bosom and elephantine waist and fly through the air as slender graceful young maidens. Animation is the art in which all wishes sweet and sour eventually come true. The sleek iron-gray thriller ""The International"" is the first of what will undoubtedly be a series of movies that melodramatize the banking industry as the ultimate in wickedness. The Luxembourg-based institution in the movie known as I.B.B.C. and clearly modelled on the infamous Bank of Credit and Commerce International (B.C.C.I.) serves as a middleman in mayhem-producing arms deals and buys off or assassinates anyone who tries to investigate its criminal behavior. Yet two virtuous people an Interpol agent (Clive Owen) and a Manhattan assistant district attorney (Naomi Watts) refuse to be intimidated and chase the bad guys all over the world. Killer banks may be new to the movies but theres nothing else original in this if-its-Tuesday-this-must-be-Istanbul thriller with its portentous globe-hopping and racing through colorful street bazaars. And theres a big hole in the middle of the movie the director Tom Tykwer and the screenwriter Eric Warren Singer forgot to make their two crusaders human beings. Clive Owen unshaven and foul-tempered stares and stares in outraged frustration but not even this excellent actor and his beautiful dark eyes can create a role entirely out of wrath. For those who like tony scenes of wealth ""The International"" offers amusingly austere impressions of high-style skullduggery--men with closely cropped beards and perfectly tailored suits meeting in circular sparsely furnished conference rooms and climbing into shiny black Audis. Yet one cant help feeling that Tykwers visual panache is beside the point. The real-world bank story is about the banality of greed not about murder ordered at the highest levels. For years thousands of ordinary financial workers created sliced up and repackaged ridiculous investments not in bursts of viciousness but as a careless exercise of avarice. No one I imagine will make a movie about that kind of banking though Id like to see Mel Brooks give it a try complete with a male chorus the Derivative Boys dancing with a BlackBerry in one hand and shooting quarterly-statement airplanes into the audience with the other.

Focus Features/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Neil Gaimans hugely popular 2002 childrens horror novel ""Coraline"" has been given the animated 3-D treatment but you may want to keep the toddlers away from this one. Director Henry Selick previously known for his collaborations with Tim Burton (""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" ""James and the Giant Peach"") is all too effective at conjuring grody ghastliness. Hes less effective at giving that ghastliness a human dimension a resonance a reason for being beyond cheap thrills. Coraline (voiced by Dakota Fanning) feels neglected by her mother and father and enters into an alternate world where she is cared for by look-alike parents who prove to be a lot more malevolent than her real ones. At least its all in 3-D instead of 2-D. Grade B- (Rated PG for thematic elements scary images some language and suggestive humor.) Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test?

"Coraline | RichardRoeper.com BLOG On Camera RR YOUTUBE CHANNEL QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS Home    Movie Reviews    Coraline Print Page Email Page Search Coraline (2009; Rated ) B- "" Impressively crafted but left me cold."" -Richard Roeper MOVIE INFORMATION Coraline(2009; PG)In theaters Friday 6 February 2009 Summary An adventurous girl finds another world that is a strangely idealized version of her frustrating home but it has sinister secrets. Genre Adventure Animation Family FantasyDirector Henry SelickCast Dakota Fanning When adults review a movie like ""Coraline"" we inevitably feel compelled to say its probably too creepy too scary and too intense for ""younger children."" All of which is true. You plunk a five-year-old down in front of this film and his nightmares on you. But what we forget is that by the time kids are a bit older they LIKE being scared. ""Coraline"" is intermittently frightening and mildly funny but its wall-to-wall creepy. It practically redefines creepy. Be advised youre going to be handed a pair of those cheap-ass plastic 3-D glasses when you enter the theater and like every pair of cheap-ass plastic 3-D glasses in movie history theyre going to make you look like either Buddy Holly or ""Pat"" or that guy from the Verizon wireless commercials. Brad Pitt could be procreating with Angelina Jolie while wearing these glasses and he wouldnt look good. The 3-D effect give extra depth to the amazing stop-motion animation. Writer/director Henry Selick follows ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and ""James and the Giant Peach"" with another meticulously crafted visual gem. ""Coraline"" is always something to behold as a treat for the eyes even when the thin story begins to lose momentum. As for that story its ""The Wizard of Oz"" laced with acid. Coraline (voiced by Dakota Fanning) is a smart but sassy little girl who has just moved with her inattentive parents (Teri Hatcher and John Hodgman) into a giant Victorian house in the Northwest. Her neighbors include a bizarro hunchbacked kid a Russian circus performer and two ancient actresses who appear to be about one drinking binge away from re-creating ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane""?"" Theres also a mangy cat hanging about. Like so many lonely girls of a certain age in stories of this kind Coraline discovers a magical world. A small door in the wall opens only at night and leads to a parallel place where Coralines ""other mother"" is a seemingly all-loving all-about-the-Coraline mom. She bakes she hugs she plays games with her little girl. Meanwhile her ""other Father"" is like Robin Williams with a green thumb the old ladies and the Russian circus performer put on spectacular shows the annoying little boy who never shuts up is now mute and the cat talks. Coraline should listen to the cat. Hes the only one who seems aware that all is not perfect in the other world. (For one thing everyone has buttons where their eyes should be.) When Coraline realizes whats happening in the other world she engages in a prolonged battle with that Other Mother who grows increasingly Wicked Witch-like. Selicks inexhaustible trick bag of insanely weird images gets darker by the minute. The pace quickens and the music intensifies but the very elements that make ""Coraline"" so interesting also serve as a barrier of sorts blocking out our involvement with the characters. By its very nature stop-motion animation practically ensures that everyone even the cute little girl of the title will seem kind of chilly and yes creepy. (The same could be said of the live-action performance capture technology used in ""The Poloar Express."") After getting over the initial gee-whiz appreciation of the great craftsmanship at work here I tried to get into the story of Coraline and I tried to care about whether shed wind up with buttons sewn into her eyes but it never really took. Im recommending ""Coraline"" but if youre not a fan of this type of animation or youre not a kid of a certain age looking to be creeped out for the fun of it youll be all right taking a pass on this one.

LAIKA Inc./Focus Features hide caption toggle caption LAIKA Inc./Focus Features Handy Man Other Father -- the head of an alternate-universe family Coraline discovers at the other end of that tunnel -- makes a grab for her. LAIKA Inc./Focus Features When her family moves to a big old country house in Oregon 11-year-old Coraline Jones is less than thrilled. In fact at the start of the stop-motion animated film that bears her name Coraline is actively bored. So she goes exploring and finds a bricked-up trapdoor. Returning to it when she hears a noise that night she finds not bricks but a tunnel -- one that seems to lead to the same room it starts in which is a little weird. But whats far weirder is that Coraline appears to have a whole other family on the other side of the door -- a family thats a lot more fun than the one shes used to except for one flaw They all have black buttons for eyes. Otherwise the button-eyed side of the trapdoor is pretty cool; its brighter happier more fun. On that side Coraline gets what she thinks shes been wanting -- more attention more engagement more emotion. But it turns out to be something less than the joyfest she was expecting. In childrens stories the grass often seems greener on the other side of some metaphorical fence and then of course it turns out not to be. Think Alice popping down her rabbit hole or Dorothy blown over the rainbow or the Pevensie kids leaping through that wardrobe into Narnia. Novelist Neil Gaiman had something similar in mind for Coraline whos forever plunging into things and director Henry Selick delights in making those plunges physical. The movies stop-motion work is plenty impressive in 2-D which is how its being shown in about half of the theaters its been booked into. But this is the first stop-motion film to be actually conceived in 3-D so its worth finding a theater playing it that way so you can get the full effect as Selick pulls the camera back into corners to make rooms loom larger and deeper and on the far side of that trapdoor scarier. Hell peer up from below at a spinning chandelier dispensing mango milkshakes or down from on high at scurrying bugs and mice using wide-angle camera work with a sort of video-gamey feel. Which youd think would seem crazily artificial. But it doesnt because Selick puts his real faith not in the gimmickry that Coralines audiences will think theyve shown up for but in the stronger virtues that theyd likely view as old-fashioned character and story and handmade figures handmade milkshakes handmade blades of grass each one moving utterly persuasively as he and his animators tweak it frame by frame.

On three of the past four weekends Americans have been obliged to wear 3D glasses as essential entertainment accessories. My Bloody Valentine sent pokers and pickaxes jutting out of the screen; the Monsters vs. Aliens commercial shown Sunday during the Super Bowl featured a profusion of protrusions. And here on a more elevated plane is Henry Selicks Coraline the first stop-motion animation feature shot in the process. (Its also being shown in a ""flat"" version.) Theres so much 3D around -- with plenty more coming this year -- that ""four eyes"" is no longer an insult; its become a crucial movie demographic. Coraline (pronounced core-align) which Selick adapted from a kids book by graphic novelist Neil Gaiman begins with a needle thrust in the viewers eye. Mostly though 3D is used to heighten the pictures antirealistic otherworldly mood. The illusion of depth is boldly stylized; the scene of a front yard or a kitchen will be a series of flat surfaces like the planes in a pop-up picture book. This is the animated film as art film. Coraline doesnt try to ingratiate; it just looms like a cemetery gate daring curious souls to tiptoe in and fend for themselves. See Times Top 10 Movies of 2008 Thats what the movies heroine Coraline Jones (voiced by Dakota Fanning) must do. Newly arrived in Oregon from Michigan with her mother (Teri Hatcher) and father (John Hodgman) she feels ignored by her stay-at-home workaholic writer parents. Father hunched over his PC is a mild preoccupied sort; but Mother has no milk-drop of the maternal instinct. She speaks to Coraline in the curt distracted voice that a stern boss would use on a cleaning woman who had entered her office during a conference call. Mother is efficient officious utterly joyless; you couldnt make her smile if you handed her over to the Guantanamo tickling team. Left on her own Coraline wanders through the huge old house now divided into several large apartments to meet the other residents Mr. Bobinsky (Ian McShane) an eight-foot-tall blue Russian who runs a circus of more-or-less trained mice; and Miss Spink (Jennifer Saunders) and Miss Forcible (Dawn French) a pair of venerable theatrical troupers endlessly recounting their glory days in the music hall. Coraline also meets a boy her age Whybe Lovet (Robert Bailey Jr.) the grandson of the grande dame who owns the place and a talking cat (Keith David) with dark secrets he eventually spills. For Coraline the big secret is behind a small locked door. Like Lewis Carrolls Alice and the Narnia children (and by now far too many tyke heroes of fairy tales) Coraline goes through the doorway into another realm. Its a long oddly uterine passage that leads to an apartment exactly like her new home and with identical parents -- except for two things. The weird news Other Mother and Other Father have buttons for eyes. The better news these cheerful folks instantly dote on the little girl as if she were the center of their universe. How lovely to see you Have some cake Let us tuck you into bed. Coraline thinks shes lucked into paradise that shes escaped the loneliness and numbing drudgery of real life where shes either an obstacle or invisible and discovered her mirror home her ideal parents an Opposite World where she feels wanted pampered and for a change happy. ""You probably think this other world is a dream come true"" the Cat tells Coraline. ""But its not."" Hes right. In the deeply darkly conservative spirit of most fairy tales which are not adventures but horror stories Coraline will find that all those sweets and sweet words are simply fattening her up for the kill like Gretel in the gingerbread house. And Other Mother is worse than a Stepford mom. Shes... well well just say shes very bad and has been so for a very long time. Almost as nefarious as her plans for her new recruit is the poison she pours in the girls ear suggesting that Coralines real parents may have permanently abandoned her. ""Perhaps they became bored of you"" Sham Mom says ""and ran away to France."" Shivery thought thats right -- her parents are the restless young couple in Revolutionary Road and Coraline is the child they disposed of. Shes dead and doesnt know it.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Feb. 5 2009 205 PM Button Eyes Coraline will freak out your kids in both good and bad ways. By Dana Stevens Coraline visits an alternate world of button-eyed doppelgangers Coraline (Focus Features) an animated feature based on the young-adult novel by Neil Gaiman and directed by Henry Selick sticks a colorful crazy straw into the well of childrens literature and drinks long and deep. Like Alice in Alice in Wonderland the heroine an 11-year-old only child goes down a hole and emerges in another world. Like the siblings in The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe she discovers that portal in a forgotten corner of her own house. The alternate universe she visits at first seduces her with its seemingly unlimited pleasures--shades of Pinocchios Land of Toys--but like Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz shes soon desperate only to go home. As it moves into its ghoulish second act though Coraline has less in common with these nursery classics than with Invasion of the Body Snatchers. The world that Coraline Jones (voiced by Dakota Fanning) enters through that bricked-up wall is an uncanny double of her own minus (or so it seems) all the bad parts. Her crabby and work-obsessed parents (Teri Hatcher and John Hodgman) have been replaced with jolly sycophants eager to satisfy her every desire Suddenly her mother whips up perfect dinners her father has planted a fantastical garden in the shape of Coralines face and the dining room chandelier doubles as a milkshake dispenser. The Jones eccentric neighbors a Russian acrobat (Ian McShane) and two aged burlesque dancers (Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders) have been transformed into younger and kindlier versions of themselves who put on fabulous shows each night for Coraline and her friend Wybie (Robert Bailey Jr.). The only downside to this Land of Cockaigne All of its denizens have flat glossy black buttons instead of eyes. A detail Coralines willing to overlook until the ""other mother"" starts demanding that Coraline take a nice sharp needle and sew on some eye-buttons of her own ""Soon youll see things our way."" Uh-oh. Advertisement Coraline is at its best in this middle section before the somewhat muddled cosmology that links these twin universes begins to unravel. The films groundbreaking animation technique--its the first stop-motion feature film to be made in three dimensions--is uniquely suited to re-creating the sensory overload Coraline experiences as she steps into this brave new world. Unlike CGI stop-motion animation is a tactile medium its textures and volumes vividly palpable. The pink gabled house in which Coraline and her parents live looks and feels like a dollhouse full of marvelous small objects (a tiny stuffed toy a hand-stitched sweater) that the viewer wants to reach in and touch--and the subtly realized 3-D effects make that interaction with the image seem almost possible. The skinny-limbed blue-haired Coraline and her castmates are actual dolls figures that had to be moved against real (if computer-enhanced) backgrounds by human hands. For fans of the old Rankin-Bass holiday specials whove never quite been convinced by the shimmering gradients of computer-generated animation this puppetry aspect of Coraline is deeply satisfying. While its way more visually sophisticated than Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer it has a touch of that shows endearing wonkiness. Its impossible to get into just why and how Coralines last third falls apart without giving away too much of the story. But its not revealing to say that Coralines enchantment with the alternate universe needed a more gradual rate of decay for the shift to be convincing. When she discovers the real motivations of the other mother the film abruptly turns from an allegory about childhood longing into a routine escape-from-the-bad-guy adventure (albeit one with fabulously nonroutine visuals including a Matrix-like moment in which Coraline reaches the edges of the alternate universe and runs through a featureless all-white no mans land). Moment by moment the film is a font of pleasures yet theres something about it that keeps the audience at an aesthetic remove. Like Coraline in the doppelganger world we swoon over all the neat stuff without ever making ourselves at home. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. One last note Coralines PG rating should have come with an asterisk specifying that its up to each individual parent (or her psychoanalyst) to gauge whether her child is old enough to deal with the appallingly scary premise of a mother replaced by a fiendish insatiable double bent on stealing her childs eyes. Im 42 and Im not sure I can handle that yet. Is there such a thing as PG-43?

This romantic comedy was spawned by the self-help manual of the same name and indirectly inspired by an episode of ""Sex and the City."" The film explores but mainly celebrates the extended adolescence of American men and women who in their 20s 30s and even 40s continue to befuddle themselves and one another with the bottomless mysteries of relationships. What did he/she mean as opposed to what he/she said? When will he/she call/text/Twitter? And how could I have been so dumb? The possibilities of the dating game are endless and the potential for pain is great yet the permutations of the movies plot are predictable and repetitive. At the same time for the same reasons the productions commercial prospects are bright. Its a star-encrusted vending machine that dispenses nuggets of conventional wisdom in zesty flavors. The cast includes Ben Affleck Jennifer Aniston Drew Barrymore Jennifer Connelly Ginnifer Goodwin Scarlett Johansson and Justin Long. Theyre in alphabetical order. If the characters they play were arranged in order of immaturity Ms. Goodwins Gigi would top the sorry list. Shes an obsessive-compulsive romantic who takes all of the movies bloated running time -- 129 minutes -- to absorb its basic message Judge guys by what they do not what they say. As a consequence the poor baby keeps waiting by her pink Princess phone for Mr. Wrong to ring and make her life right. (Her Princess is tethered to the only land line in a wireless world where as noted in the script by Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein cell phones and caller ID have had a deep impact on dating patterns.) ENLARGE Ginnifer Goodwin Jennifer Aniston and Jennifer Connelly in Hes Just Not That Into You. Warner Bros. Gigis endless neediness is frightening but her plight is played for laughs like almost everything and everyone around her. The comedy can be sharp from time to time especially in a few mock-documentary straight-to-the-camera interviews when supposed veterans of the relationship wars offer wry advice to the chronically lovelorn. And Jennifer Aniston sustains a nicely astringent tone as Beth a marketing executive at a spice company -- all occupations are generic -- whose need to tie the knot threatens to destroy her great relationship with Neil (Mr. Affleck) a marriage-averse photographer. For the most part though ""Hes Just Not That Into You"" feels like a sitcom that resolves each mini-dilemma before going to commercial. The films director Ken Kwapis has done far better work than this; his extensive TV credits include the pilots of ""The Office"" ""The Larry Sanders Show"" and ""The Bernie Mac Show."" So too has Jennifer Connelly distinguished herself in such dramatic roles as a drug addict in ""Requiem for a Dream"" and John Nashs wife Alicia Nash in ""A Beautiful Mind."" Unfortunately her character here another spice merchandiser named Janine seems to have lost her mind. Janine hates lying -- we get that -- and her husband is a casual liar; we get that too. But Ms. Connellys ferocious wrath might better have been reserved for a revival of ""Medea."" Instead of lightening up she darkens down. The Pink Panther 2 If ""The Pink Panther 2"" were merely a minimalist approach to the classic series it might have been in keeping with Steve Martins own esthetic; hes a past master of subtle comedy. But the movie is minimumist -- as bare-bones as a ""Panther"" can be and still get away with it. This time the ever-bumbling Inspector Clouseau is on the ever-meandering trail of a thief who steals such priceless artifacts as the Magna Carta (nothing is made of that theft) the Shroud of Turin (Clouseau calls the pontiff Mr. Pope and detects that hes very spiritual) and the Pink Panther Diamond whose re-disappearance -- it was stolen in the previous film too -- may have been required for the perfunctory script to fill 90 minutes. That film gave Steve Martin his first crack at a character famously played by Peter Sellers and Alan Arkin and he pulled the role off with beguiling panache. This time he goes through the motions plus a few gyrations as a flamenco dancer with a dogged sense of duty thats shared by other prisoners of the shabby production Jean Reno Emily Mortimer John Cleese and Lily Tomlin who plays a strident enforcer of political correctness. The soundtrack makes generous use of trombones to indicate humor. Coraline Creating ""Coraline"" See an interactive graphic on the seven-year production process required for the making of the 3-D stop-motion movie. ""Coraline"" is Henry Selicks stop-motion 3-D version of Neil Gaimans fantasy novel about a young girl who discovers on the other side of a brick wall an alternate version of her happy home with an Other Mother who seems more loving than her own. Anyone who has seen Mr. Selicks earlier animated features ""James and the Giant Peach"" and ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" knows of his abundant gifts for graphic design. But ""Coraline"" is distinguished if you can call it that by a creepiness so deep as to seem perverse and the film finally succumbs to terminal deficits in dramatic energy narrative coherence and plain old heart. Even the 3-D effects fall into a no-puppets-land between art and technical oddity; some figures pop out from the screen fully modeled others stay stubbornly flat. Thats a relatively minor issue however in a childrens entertainment thats much too scary for little kids (ugly insects provide a pervasive visual motif) and too lifeless to enchant older audiences. Its as if Mr. Selick reached a brick wall on the way to feeling what his characters might feel and never found a way to punch through. DVD Focus Bob amp; Carol amp; Ted amp; Alice (1969) Theres no bloat in this relationship classic a first feature that Paul Mazursky directed from a script he wrote with Larry Tucker. The main targets of the loose buoyant satire are marriage inhibition and sexual freedom not to mention -- and its never specifically mentioned -- countercultural smugness. Bob and Carol played by Robert Culp and Natalie Wood spend a weekend of self-discovery at Northern Californias now-venerable Esalen Institute. Back in Los Angeles they preach the swingers gospel to their uptight friends Ted and Alice. Theyre played by Elliott Gould and Dyan Cannon both of whom are sensational funny. All of Me (1984) It was bad enough watching Steve Martin and Lily Tomlin soldiering through ""The Pink Panther 2."" But it was worse remembering what glories theyd achieved in this romantic comedy directed by Carl Reiner. She plays Edwina a dying millionaire spinster who arranges to have her soul transplanted into the body of a beautiful young woman. He plays Roger an attorney whos supposed to revise her will. When she dies prematurely in the midst of great confusion something goes wrong and she ends up sharing Rogers body in a crazed kind of joint tenancy. Though the film is imperfect the physical comedy is often sublime. Corpse Bride (2005) This stop-motion animated feature directed by Tim Burton and Mike Johnson combines charming creepiness blithe necrophilia and unexpected sweetness; the films seems bathed in the milk of inhuman kindness. You know something special is going on when youre instantly smitten along with Johnny Depps Victorian bridegroom by a winsome blue-faced maggot-ridden bride who is not just anorexic but downright skeletal and irreversibly if seductively dead. (Shes voiced by Helena Bonham Carter.) Energy abounds in ""Corpse Bride"" but this singular little film also takes time to smell the wilted roses. Who knew that death could be so vital? --- Joe Morgenstern Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com Find related television listings at LocateTV.

ABOUT THE MOVIECoraline   1/2 (out of four)Voices Dakota Fanning Teri Hatcher Dawn French Keith DavidDirector Henry SeligDistributor Focus FeaturesRating PG for for thematic elements scary images some language and suggestive humorRunning time 1 hour 40 minutesOpens today nationwide  WATCH THE TRAILER By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Its gorgeous to watch in all its dazzling stop-motion animation splendor but the wizardry of Coraline is more to be admired than enthusiastically embraced. GALLERY Spend some time in Coralines world This animated fantasy based on a 2002 childrens novel by Neil Gaiman and directed by Henry Selick (The Nightmare Before Christmas) is a visual marvel but its uneven in its story. The narrative lacks focus. Still its exquisite images have an undeniable whimsical appeal. The adventure saga envisioned and shot in stereoscopic 3-D centers on blue-tressed Coraline Jones (Dakota Fanning) a spunky tween. She has just moved with her mother and father (Teri Hatcher and John Hodgman) from Michigan to Oregon and feels lost. Her parents arent much help distracted as they are by their work and settling in to new surroundings. Coraline tries to explore those surroundings but finds more boredom than fun. The oddball neighbors dont offer much amusement. She cant quite warm up to the overbearing aging British actresses (Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French). Slightly more interesting is the outrageous Russian former gymnast (Ian McShane). She dismisses a boy named Wybie (Robert Bailey Jr.) as a stalker. Eventually Coraline does find excitement -- more than she bargained for -- when she discovers a hidden door in her familys drab apartment. It leads to a parallel universe. In her real world Coralines snappish mother cleans while her father cooks unappetizing dishes. Neither seems to pay enough attention to their daughter. In the alternate world Coralines Other Mother is a fabulous cook. Coralines room is a young girls fantasy bedroom. Coralines Other Father takes her for rides on a wild contraption through a phantasmagoric garden that he planted just for her. But Coraline soon finds her glorious dream becoming a gothic nightmare. The sugary-sweet Other Mother turns malevolent and her Other Father proves ineffectual. Their home once filled with flowers and tasty treats becomes a creepy lair that ensnares innocent kids. The 3-D is underused but more often the beauty of the animation resonates. Coraline is a plucky heroine and director Seligs imagination is indisputable. But the story falters in parts and its dark tone could be off-putting for children. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Reader Editor Brent Jones.

"Coraline Out of this world | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsCoraline Out of this worldThe highest praise that can be bestowed upon the richly deserving Coraline is that it doesnt require the dubious adornment of 3-D.Coraline takes a mysterious tunnel to another world and takes moviegoers with her in this four-star animated flick.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Feb. 6 2009 Coraline (out of 4)Animation featuring the voices of Dakota Fanning Teri Hatcher Keith David John Hodgman and Robert Bailey Jr. Directed by Henry Selick. 101 minutes. At major theatres. Check listings for 3-D screenings. PG The highest praise that can be bestowed upon the richly deserving Coraline is that it doesnt require the dubious adornment of 3-D.This animated screen rendering of Neil Gaimans masterful childrens horror fantasy is so full of life and texture its almost gilding the lily to add the third dimension to it.You dont need things popping out of the screen to appreciate what director Henry Selick (The Nightmare Before Christmas) and his stop-motion boffins have wrought especially since you might well be looking through your fingers at times while watching it.Coraline (pronounced Cora-LINE) presents a fully realized alternate world just outside our own that simultaneously enchants terrifies and instructs - the lesson being contained in the tagline adage ""Be careful what you wish for."" In fairness this is quality 3-D and Selick doesnt rely on the old trick of making you jump by hurling things at you. But neither should you feel youre missing something if you catch a screening in good ol 2-D as many people will. Coraline is the dark side of the Alice in Wonderland legend the saga of a young girl who enters a cosmic portal to find a world both thrilling and challenging. Unlike the Lewis Carroll story Gaimans midnight vision has evil spiders and rats rather that benevolent rabbits and caterpillars. The movie also owes a debt to Tim Burton the visual whiz who produced The Nightmare Before Christmas and whose earlier Beetlejuice is fondly recalled in the design of Coralines funky home where most of the action takes place.Known as the Pink Palace the house perches atop a hill as the new rural Oregon abode of sullen preteen Coraline (Dakota Fanning) whose granola-loving parents are attempting to live their own back-to-the-earth fantasy.Mom (Teri Hatcher) and Dad (John Hodgman) are too preoccupied with their writing gardening and cooking chores to assist Coraline in adapting to her new environment. Theyve chosen such a remote locale that the only neighbouring kid is the strangely intense Wybie (Robert Bailey Jr.) a character created for the movie who at first meeting terrifies Coraline with his skeleton mask and Ghost Rider impression.Blue-haired Coraline is quick to adjust and as curious as all get-out when she discovers a door in her new home that opens to a bricked-up portal. When she awakens one night to find the bricks gone and an undulating tunnel beckoning she enters to find herself in a world at once familiar and strange.Cheerful people calling themselves Other Mother and Other Father (also voiced by Hatcher and Hodgman) appear to be perfect copies of Coralines parents with one disturbing obvious difference they have black buttons on their faces in place of eyes. Even as she shivers at this Coraline delights in the treats offered by Other Mother and Other Father all of her favourite dishes cooked so much better than her real parents could manage. Out back of this alternate Pink Palace theres not a mess of weeds and mud but rather a garden of unearthly delights shaped to resemble her now-smiling face. Coraline also meets her exceedingly odd neighbours whom shed never really noticed before aging burlesque actresses Miss Forcible (Dawn French) and Miss Spink (Jennifer Saunders) and a former Russian acrobat Mr. Bobinsky (Ian MacShane) whose hobby is training mice to do circus tricks. As bizarre as it all is its also highly appealing to Coraline who thinks shed rather live with happy freaks than stay with her dull and pestering parents - and what kid wouldnt?Other Mother smiles knowingly and says a permanent transition can be arranged as long as Coraline agrees to sew up a couple of minor details ...The shocking request prompts Coraline to do some sleuthing aided by a mysterious black cat (Keith David) who also has the ability to traverse between the two worlds and who isnt at all fond of Other Mother - for good reason as it turns out.The films third act becomes a real horror thriller intense enough that parents with very young children should think twice about attending. A good test for your tot would be a reading of Gaimans original book and judging reactions accordingly - if the book keeps them awake for one night the movie will do it for a week. The score by French composer Bruno Coulais adds to the creeping dread bringing to mind the malevolent nursery vibe of Rosemarys Baby.English lit scholars and other pipe-smoking types will spot an intriguing reference in the odd other name given to Other Mother ""The Beldam.""It cannily connects to John Keatss haunting La belle dame sans merci (The Beautiful Lady without Pity) a haunting romantic poem in which a hapless knight is disastrously enchanted by a dangerously enigmatic woman.""La Belle Dame sans Merci hath thee in thrall"" goes the rhymes frightful summation and that ably describes how Coraline will grab you too.Read Richard Ouzounians interview with author Neil Gaiman in tomorrows Aamp;EutThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Featuring the voices of Dakota Fanning Teri Hatcher and Keith David. Directed by Henry Selick. (PG. 101 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The deepest virtues of ""Coraline"" are dark. This seemingly innocuous 3-D animation presents a grim vision of the modern family - as something to escape from - and shows the imagination as something too terrifying and self-consuming to offer refuge. That the movie does all this from within the confines of the childrens-film genre makes it all the more eerie and unconsciously evocative. What a shrewd achievement for writer-director Henry Selick (""The Nightmare Before Christmas"") to have made a movie that everyone will acclaim as beautiful when perhaps the most beautiful thing about it is the sheer ugliness of it all. Coraline is an 11-year-old girl newly moved into a big old house with her parents who both write about gardening even though theyre both so busy writing that they have no time to do any digging. Coraline is a querulous child about as adorable as a skin rash bossy with friends and demanding with her parents. Dakota Fanning voices Coraline and makes her even more unpleasant than the script demands. The idea of little girls throughout America actually identifying with this animated character is perhaps the scariest thing about the movie. We soon find that Coraline got her charm from Mom and Dad. Mom (Teri Hatcher) is sarcastic and unloving without a kind word for anyone and Dad (John Hodgman) is downright creepy one of those guys - we all know one - who halfheartedly pretends that his detachment is a form of wry affability. Its not. And so Coraline has a mother who isnt there and a father who has checked out long ago. Both are buried in work. This is a portrait of the American family that many children will recognize much to the embarrassment of their parents. Coraline longs for something better and one day after she has gone to bed she is awakened by a mouse which leads her to a small door that takes her out of her own house into another house. This house is an idealized version of her present reality Instead of dreary the house is colorful. The parents there are idealized versions of her own parents in that theyre loving and kind and make delicious dinners every night. Theres one point of peculiarity however These alternative parents have buttons in place of their eyes like old-fashioned dolls. This produces an unsettling affect. Indeed even before the story tips its hand something in the smiling unreality of these images suggests that something isnt right about Coralines idealized world. Based on Neil Gaimans book this is ""Alice in Wonderland"" or ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" all over again a metaphorical tour through the contours of the unconscious where the monsters are always hiding either underneath the floorboards or right around the corner. This is the LSD trip right before the friendly people grow fangs and start laughing when you scream. As a live-action film ""Coraline"" would have been too literal and either too frightening or too absurd (or both). The stop-action animation allows the filmmakers to turn unconscious terror into pleasing pictures thus enabling them to go further and deeper. By midway ""Coraline"" reaches the point that it seems to be hinting at dimly repressed childhood nightmares. We watch with a sense of memory and vague unsettled recognition. Theres something going on here something true and odd and definitely not cheerful and it gets under the skin. Meanwhile ""Coraline"" is gorgeous - gorgeous like a Venus flytrap A marching band of mice jump around in a mouse theater. Plants bloom into three-dimensional life in a moonlit garden. By such diversions the movie creates an aura of safety - and sneaks up on us slowly. Its method is actually a metaphor for the story being told in which the unconscious mind using pretty symbols and diversions goes on the attack. In keeping with this underlying seriousness the actors dont camp it up. I particularly enjoyed the cat as voiced by Keith David who has narrated so many documentaries on the History Channel that I half expected the cat to say something about World War II. He doesnt. The actors play it straight. They dont try to be charming or ad lib wisecracks. They serve the directors vision and what a rich strange vision it is. -- Advisory May be frightening for younger children.

Stephanie Zacharek Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies Neil Gaiman Entertainment News Theres often a pall of creepiness hanging over the most memorable childrens literature Wooden puppets yearning to become real boys are instead turned into circus donkeys liable to be skinned if they cant perform on demand. Spoiled young girls who insist on wearing red shoes to church are doomed to dance until the end of time even after their feet have been chopped off and replaced with wooden prosthetics. These stories were designed in part to scare kids into behaving but they tend to outlast their obvious motivational purposes. They often stick with us into adulthood perhaps as a reminder that childhood isnt necessarily a pretty or an easy place even though we often talk ourselves into remembering it that way.""Coraline"" Neil Gaimans compact but beautifully textured 2002 childrens novel is a modern-day fairy tale with its share of dark jagged corners. Its eponymous heroine is a little girl whose parents are often distracted and dont always have time for her. But she discovers an alternative family that at first seems to be an improvement -- although this Other Mother and Father do have buttons sewn where their eyes should be and you can bet thats not a good sign.Reading ""Coraline"" as an adult makes you realize youre never too old to want to sleep with a light on. The wonder of Henry Selicks gorgeous stop-motion animation version of Gaimans novel is that it preserves the books shivery unsettling qualities even as it expands on and slightly recasts the original story. ""Coraline"" is essentially faithful to the spirit of its source material. But its also so visually inventive and so elaborately tactile that it stands apart as its own creation. I dont recommend ""Coraline"" for very small children and Ill warn you that it may also make very big children -- Exhibit A Me -- feel very small. In the pictures opening-credits sequence (set to the most sinister-sounding lullaby music youve ever heard) a floppy used-up cloth doll has her innards removed and replaced her button-eyes resewn and her belly neatly sutured all by a spidery disembodied hand.But Selick -- the director of ""Tim Burtons The Nightmare Before Christmas"" as well as the charming 1996 Roald Dahl adaptation ""James and the Giant Peach"" and the raucous grown-up fantasy ""Monkeybone"" -- knows how to impart a sense of delight and wonder to even the spooky stuff. In ""Coraline"" the creepiest moments and images are also among the most seductively beautiful. The movie opens with the bored restless Coraline (voiced by Dakota Fanning) exploring the grounds of the rambling house shes just moved into with her parents Its an elegantly ramshackle Victorian called the Pink Palace Apartments and in her early explorations in the yard she meets a nerdy neighbor kid on a motorbike Wybie Lovat (Robert Bailey Jr.) -- a newly invented character who does not appear in Gaimans book -- who seems nice enough even though hes wearing a skeleton mask. Later Wybie gives her a doll that looks suspiciously like the one weve already met in the credit sequence. And thats where Coralines adventures springing from her restless wish that her family life could be ""different"" begin.In Coralines real life her mother and father are both writers -- their specialty is gardening even though they dont care much for dirt. Dad (John Hodgman) cooks the familys meals; his specialties are slippery disgusting-looking concoctions that sit in a heavy mound on the dinner plate. Mom (Teri Hatcher) is in charge of cleaning the house which is why she wont let Coraline go out in the rain -- she doesnt want to have to wipe up all that mud. And so Coraline wandering through the house discovers a secret door and finds on the other side of it an ""Other"" mother and father -- with buttons where their eyes should be -- who are willing to cater to her every whim. The Other Father has planted just for her a marvelous moonlight garden complete with glow-in-the-dark snapdragons that really look and move like dragons and the Other Mother presents her with elaborate delicious and picture-perfect meals (although curiously she eats nothing herself). Coraline at first delighted by this alternative home universe begins thinking it might be time to trade up in the family department. Maybe she could even learn to overlook the button thing. You Might Also Like Theres a catch of course and before Coraline can choose the family she wants to live with her Other Mother makes the choice for her. Selick -- who also wrote the screenplay -- has intensified some of Gaimans original themes in addition to introducing a few overtly Freudian elements. This ""Coraline"" suggests some of the ways parents try to hold onto us to keep us from growing up and therefore leaving them forever. It also flirts with the insidious rivalries that can crop up between mothers and daughters. (When Coraline learns that her Other Mothers intentions arent entirely selfless she says in astonishment ""Mothers dont eat daughters"" But sometimes at least in fairy tales and in parts of Southern California they may wish they could as a way of preserving their own youth and beauty.)Theres so much going on in ""Coraline"" -- both visually and in terms of its elaborate story -- that the experience of watching it can be a little overwhelming. Selick and his team clearly came up with so many enticing visual and narrative angles they couldnt bear to edit them down and the picture might have benefited from some streamlining. But ""Coraline"" has been made with so much care and with so much attention to detail that maybe its just as well theres more of it rather than less. The supporting characters in the story -- including the Russian mouse trainer Mr. Bobinksy (Ian McShane) the former vaudeville performers known as Miss Spink and Miss Forcible (with voices supplied by the English comedy duo Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French) and the character known simply as Cat (Keith David) an elegant black creature with mischievous-looking eyes -- are all beautifully designed. But its the thousand-and-one details around all these characters that give the movie its glorious and varied textures. Mr. Bobinskys performing mice are hoppity fellows with extraordinarily long tails who scamper and dance and play (as Gaiman described in his book) musical instruments with their tiny mouse fingers. One sequence features a performance hall filled with fidgety pointy-bearded scottie dogs. There are 248 of them to be exact and according to the movies press notes none of these extras was computer-generated. That means every single pup you see on the screen is an actual movable puppet figure although many of the ""background"" dogs were operated via a mechanical system. I have to say it sounds a little obsessive. On the other hand we live in a world flooded with cheap shoddily made goods Almost nothing is made to last anymore; everything is mass-produced and designed to be replaced. So even if ""Coraline"" suggests that the many many people who worked on it are at least slightly mad it is also clearly a labor of love. Nearly everything in ""Coraline"" -- from the puppet characters themselves to their small sweaters and shoes (the latter of which were in some cases cut from antique Victorian kid gloves) to the numerous miniature props (which include a toy chest full of weird wriggly toys with button eyes) -- has been painstakingly handmade and although the film was shot with digital cameras the images have not been computer-enhanced. The picture is being shown in select theaters in 3-D and while Im generally not much of a fan of the 3-D experience the technology lends itself beautifully to the tactile nature of stop-motion animation At one point I really did believe I could reach out and grab the long waving tails of those performing mice. The devil they say is in the details and ""Coraline"" brings them close enough to touch. Stephanie Zacharek is a senior writer for Salon Arts amp; Entertainment. More Stephanie Zacharek.

The dark sensibilities of Selick - the genius best known for directing the classic ""Tim Burtons The Nightmare Before Christmas"" - perfectly mesh with Neil Gaimans childrens book a twisted variation on ""Alice in Wonderland."" Coraline Jones voiced by the ubiquitous Dakota Fanning (also on hand today in the flesh with ""Push"") is a bored 11-year-old who has just moved into a dreary boarding house with her workaholic writer parents (Teri Hatcher and John Hodgman) who are vegans to boot. One day she discovers a door that leads into a parallel dimension (or whatever) where she discovers alternate versions of her parents who are cheery attentive and serve food she actually enjoys. Coraline is delighted to find there is no place for boredom in this universe where the elderly boarders - a pair of actresses (Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French) and a circus performer (Ian McShane) - are always ready to put on a show. Before you can say ""Be careful what you wish for"" the Other Mother announces her plan to make Coraline a permanent guest by sewing black buttons in place of Coralines eyes - just like she and the other alterna-boarders have. Can the suddenly frightened Coraline escape this fate with the help of a talking cat (voiced by Keith David) and a goofy neighbor (Robert Bailey Jr.)? ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" was beautifully converted to 3-D a couple of years ago but the exquisitely designed ""Coraline"" was conceived specifically for three- dimensional presentation. Its an ideal way to experience the tactile delights of stop-motion in which animators move tiny puppets and objects by hand - a fraction of an inch for each frame. This is perhaps the most effective 3-D movie I have ever seen with a sophisticated involving story that will appeal to many adults. The only reservation I have is with the PG rating which seems too lenient for a story that may give very young children - particularly if they are sensitive - nightmares. If you can try to see ""Coraline"" on the huge screen at the Ziegfeld. They didnt screen the 2-D version showing at some theaters for critics but personally why bother? CORALINE 3-D stunner. Running time 101 minutes. Rated PG (scary images suggestive humor). At the Ziegfeld the Empire the Union Square others.

USA - 2009 /0902031057 (LILO/SIPA) Elizabeth Weitzman Friday February 6 2009 1127 AM Animated fantasy about a little girl trapped in an alternate world. With the voices of Dakota Fanning Teri Hatcher. Director Henry Selick (140). PG Scary images and themes mild language. At area theaters. An extraordinary achievement that nevertheless falls short of its full potential ""Coraline"" is absolutely worth seeing for older children and adults alike. But the connection will be entirely through your eyes; if you want it to touch your heart youll have to go to the book on which its based. For his first feature screenplay director Henry Selick chose to adapt Neil Gaimans fairy tale of the same name. The material should be a perfect match Both men have a deep respect for the fears and fantasies of childhood. But Selick is a visual artist and the tone-deaf changes he makes to Gaimans perfect story are undeniably disappointing. When the movie begins smart lonely Coraline (voiced by Dakota Fanning) has just moved to a new house with her work-aholic parents (Teri Hatcher John Hodgman). Since theyre too busy to play she wanders off to meet her strange neighbors (including Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French) and explore her creepy home. Eventually she winds up in a mirror universe which comes complete with an other set of parents. They claim to adore Coraline to want to play with her and cook for her and do all the things her real parents wont. But something seems dreadfully off about their love even to this neglected child. Its almost impossible to overstate the artistry that unfolds on Selicks screen. Using the stop-motion animation he employed for ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" -- enhanced by astonishing 3-D effects -- he creates a darkly compelling fantasia in which every corner holds surprises. Alas amid all this beauty -- some of it unabashedly grotesque -- he lets Gaimans points slip through his fingers. None of the scripts changes are useful but one is especially dismaying. ""Cora-line"" was written for Gaimans daughters and its a wonderful lesson in courage and self-reliance. Yet the movie introduces a new character an annoying boy who befriends our heroine and eventually comes to her rescue. Huh? The Coraline we already know and love would kick this kid to the curb fully capable of saving herself.

Adapted from the childrens novel by acclaimed fantasy author Neil Gaiman the film conjures a world of wonders in 3D stop-motion animation. It creates two worlds actually as the heroine discovers a passageway from her daily life (Oregon rain boring parents) to a parallel universe thats entirely too good to be true. The director genius puppetmaster Henry Selick (""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" ""James and the Giant Peach"") has created an agreeably creepy wonderland of giant bugs dancing flowers and acrobatic mice along with a few hair-raising hobgoblins that find a worthy adversary in courageous Coraline. The very tenderest young sprouts may find the film overwhelming but most kids will enjoy the spunky heroines triumph over the forces of darkness and temptation. Like many good adventures the story begins in boredom. With too much time on her hands Coraline (voiced by Dakota Fanning) begins exploring her new home a mysterious Victorian mansion. It is equipped with a secret child-sized door and on the other side Coraline finds a replica of her household. This one however has lovely furnishings scrumptious food animated toys and two hyper-attentive parents the Other Father and the Other Mother -- a very possessive button-eyed beauty who aims to keep Coraline by her side forever and ever and ever. All she asks in return is to pluck out Coralines pretty hazel eyes and sew a couple of dull black buttons into the sockets. When Coraline objects to staying in her house and under her thumb the other mother replies with honeyed assertiveness ""Im going to need a Yes."" The film is a cavalcade of talent. Teri Hatcher delivers a revelatory vocal performance as Coralines two mothers one speaking with exasperated affection the other with sugarcoated malice. Ian McShane is in fine form as a consonant-crunching Russian acrobat who lives in the apartment above Coralines and the English comedy team of Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders play verbal badminton with their dialogue as daffy old actresses who inhabit the room below. Selicks vision is whimsical macabre and ornate. His puppets painstakingly manipulated frame by frame are remarkably expressive; Coraline is believably sullen stubborn frightened and brave. Selick takes the tale into phantasmagorical realms in the last act when Coralines rebellion against the Other Mother becomes a battle royal involving a tractor morphed into a praying mantis and a 20-story spider web. CORALINE  out of 4 stars Rating PG for thematic elements scary images some language and suggestive humor. The 3D spatial effects are consistently impressive although the transition from page to screen is not to borrow a phrase from Gaiman ""as smooth as oiled silk."" Selicks screenplay adds a dirt-biking neighbor boy who helps save the day (undercutting the heroines independence in order to draw in young males) and a lollapalooza action finale that turns the novels supple suggestive prose into something that might have been rewritten by Michael Bay. And the horror of replacing Coralines eyes with buttons is diminished by the fact that she is after all a doll. A live actress threatened with eye replacement would evoke a greater sense of peril. But these are quibbles. In every way that matters the film is a miraculous achievement. Movies often promise a magical experience and welsh on the deal. ""Coraline"" delivers.

"Coraline - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMOVIE REVIEW Coraline3-D melds with stop-motion to create a fantastical magical world.February 06 2009|KENNETH TURAN | FILM CRITIC The third dimension comes of age with ""Coraline."" The first contemporary film in which the 3-D experience feels intrinsic to the story instead of a Godforsaken gimmick ""Coraline"" is a remarkable feat of imagination a magical tale with a genuinely sinister edge.The story of an 11-year-old girls adventures in an alternate universe ""Coraline"" comes by its disturbing qualities honestly through the efforts of writer-director Henry Selick and novelist Neil Gaiman. It may be rated PG but it is more suitable for adults than the very small among us.Gaiman one of the premier dark fantasists of his generation wrote the original novel which has been translated into 30 languages and sold a million copies worldwide. As for Selick his past as the director of the deliciously creepy ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" tells you everything you need to know.If youve seen ""Nightmare"" you know that Selick is the preeminent practitioner of stop-motion animation which makes ""Coraline"" the first 3-D film to be made in that painstaking labor-intensive process that involves the frame-by-frame manipulation of three-dimensional models. Stop-motion and 3-D may seem like strange bedfellows but in fact they complement each other beautifully.Thats because while stop-motion creates a fantastical imaginary world the addition of the third dimension makes it so unblinkingly real we feel we could walk around in it. The third dimension is how the universe rattling around in Selicks head gains authenticity on-screen and to watch it unfold that way makes the theatrical experience feel special in a way it often hasnt in years.Coraline Jones the films feisty heroine (expertly voiced by Dakota Fanning) is introduced with a crisis on her hands. She and her unnamed parents (Teri Hatcher and John Hodgman) have moved from Michigan to dark and rainy Ashland Ore. taking up rooms in a large Victorian called the Pink Palace where Coraline is bored bored bored.Thats in large part because her parents are oblivious to her existence and given to saying things like ""Im really really busy"" whenever she tries to get their attention. Even the appearance of a local boy named Wybie (Robert Bailey Jr.) doesnt help.So Coraline is more than delighted when she discovers a hidden door in the house that opens onto a rabbit hole that leads down to a parallel world. There she meets her Other Mother and her Other Father the attentive devoted parents shes always wanted. They look and sound like her real parents with one unsettling exception Their active eyes have been replaced by large black buttons.Everything in this other world is livelier and more exotic than the one upstairs. Even Coralines neighbors the furtive acrobat known as the Amazing Bobinsky (Ian McShane) and the retired actresses called Miss Spink and Miss Forcible (the British comedy team of Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French) are much wilder and crazier down here than in the real world.Its in this thrilling other world that the combination of stop-motion and 3-D really comes into its own. A jumping mouse circus has 61 mice on-screen (and took 66 days to animate) and an entire audience of Scottie dogs 248 strong watches a theatrical performance. Its impossible not to be impressed.The more wonderful this world becomes the more the Other Mother pressures Coraline to stay forever to trade in her eyes for buttons. It becomes harder and harder for the girl to return to her real home and the entire experience turns slowly but inexorably into the kind of nightmare you cant wake up from no matter how hard you try. Advised by a self-possessed talking cat (Keith David) Coraline has to realize what is important in life and fight to keep herself and her family alive.To bring this complex unexpected world to the screen required a punishing investment of time and energy. ""Coraline"" spent two years in preproduction and then shot for 83 weeks on more than 50 small stages at Laika an Oregon animation studio owned by Nikes Phil Knight.Every frame of film wrote director of photography Pete Kozachik in American Cinematographer magazine was ""so dearly bought."" But while youre watching ""Coraline"" you are aware of none of that. Instead you are captured completely by what is going on.

Dakota Fanning is the voice of the little girl in Coraline. Photo AP Coraline 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Any fantasy worth its fairy dust takes us by the hand and leads us to another world. A good one makes us believe were actually there. But only a great one traps us. Henry Selicks Coraline is a PG-rated animated childrens film and the first stop-motion feature to be shot in 3-D. It is a sumptuous visual feast and a perfectly enchanting story. Yet its also white-knuckle scary -- not just cleverly morbid on the order of Tim Burtons Corpse Bride or Selicks The Nightmare Before Christmas but taut suspenseful and altogether goose-bump-inducing in a way that recalls classic gothic horror. Ill admit it my spine tingled. No way I would ever crawl down a shimmering violet tunnel into an other-verse beaded with black button eyes. But the title heroine? No fear. A blue-haired pixie who dreads nothing worse than boredom she has the burden of two distracted parents and too much time. Mom (voiced by Teri Hatcher) and Dad (John Hodgman) are writers on deadline for a garden catalog though they appear to hold no enthusiasm for the subject matter Theyre not big on flowers and they dont like dirt. To make matters worse Coraline (the spry Dakota Fanning) and her parents have moved into a dilapidated pink house also occupied by a chesty Russian circus gymnast (Ian McShane) and a couple of powdery old actresses (Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French) who hoard vintage taffy. A mysterious door in Coralines bedroom looks promising but leads nowhere. Then theres the owners annoying grandson (Robert Bailey Jr.) a kid in a skeleton costume by the name of Wybie -- short for ""Why Be Born."" One day Wybie finds a blue-haired doll thats the spitting image of Coraline -- or would be if she had black-button eyes -- and hands it to her. Someone else (say me) might shriek at this creepy voodoo plaything but not the doughty Coraline; she totes it around during the day and parks it next to her at night. And when she wakes in darkness to find a swirling passageway behind the mystery door she crawls right on through. At the far end of that crawlspace is a duplicate of Coralines home. There she finds her ""other mother"" and ""other father -- doppelgangers who wear those implacable button eyes. And at first its all delightful Other Mom bakes chicken and cupcakes Other Dad doodles at the piano in a polka-dot bathrobe. (""I didnt know I had an Other Mother"" says Coraline amazed. O-Mom replies ""Of course you do -- everyone does."" Shiver) As for the garden its a luminous spree of snapdragons and trumpet vines and magnificent flowering trees all of it exploding with color under a moonlit sky. A conduit to another realm can assume many forms. Alice has her looking glass; the Pevensies have their wardrobe; Harry Potter rides public transit; Dorothy takes the nearest tornado. In Selicks adaptation of James and the Giant Peach a boy finds a world beneath the down of massive fruit. But Coralines journey -- based on Neil Gaimans award-winning juvenile novella -- has more in common with Hansel and Gretels walk through the forest because she arrives as they do in the cozy digs of evil incarnate. And she has only her stomach to blame. Coralines seduction into Otherhood would be less persuasive in a less-gorgeous movie but the visuals are astonishing. The old-fashioned labor-intensive stop-motion approach has been sexed up with newfangled technologies but theres nothing forced or gimmicky about the results; aside from a pointy darning needle and a few fluttering hummingbirds the film is blessedly free of the usual 3-D money shots. No projectile body fluids goosh from the screen. Instead Coraline belongs in a surreal seamless universe that occupies three dimensions as naturally as you do.

JENNIE PUNTER From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Thursday Feb. 05 2009 410PM EST Last updated Thursday Apr. 09 2009 1118PM EDT Comments AA Coraline Directed and written by Henry Selick Featuring the voices of Dakota Fanning and Teri Hatcher Classification PG Ever since Alice tumbled down the rabbit hole stories have been told about lonely imaginative little girls passing through dark narrow portals into topsy-turvy often menacing worlds - but never in stereoscopic stop-motion animation. If youve been following the hype you know 3-D is back and better then ever - at least the glasses are comfier. For some flicks itll be a gimmick to get bums in seats during these penny-pinching times. But in the case of Coraline the thrilling eye-poppingly gorgeous new film from Henry Selick (director of the musical stop-motion classic The Nightmare Before Christmas) the technique propels a true creative revelation. Coraline the first stop-motion feature conceived to be shot in 3-D is based on the popular multi-award-winning 2002 novella by British writer Neil Gaiman of Sandman comics fame who sent the manuscript to Selick long before it was published. Rather than use the books illustrations (by Dave McKean) as a visual jumping-off point Selick who wrote the adaptation decided to create a brave new look starting with concept designs illustrations and scratch animation then moving into the painstaking team work of building the spectacularly detailed puppet universe where the action unfolds. Presented the usual way the film would be enchanting. In 3-D however Coraline is completely engrossing. Selick uses the technique brilliantly to enhance the comedy and horror that mingle in his more ""family-friendly"" version of Gaimans dark story. Right away we know evil doings are afoot. The opening credits show sinister-looking hands refurbishing an old doll sewing on button eyes as a finishing touch. The doll which resembles our heroine becomes the companion of 11-year-old Coraline (Dakota Fanning) a feisty curious and temporarily emotionally neglected only child who has just moved to a remote ramshackle rooming house. Coralines surroundings are Spartan and drab. Her mother and father (Teri Hatcher and John Hodgman) serve bland vegetarian food and are preoccupied with a writing deadline. The other tenants are eccentric upstairs Mr. Bobinsky (Ian McShane) an eight-foot-tall blue Russian acrobat claims to have a jumping-mouse circus; downstairs Miss Spink and Miss Forcible (Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French both of Absolutely Fabulous - stroke-of-genius casting) are an overweight retired nightclub act who have mounted their many deceased Scottie dogs on the wall. The only kid around is the weird and annoyingly talkative Wybie (Robert Bailey Jr.) a character added by Selick. One night Coraline discovers a passage to an alternate version of her world. Everything is prettier livelier and tastier. Aside from having button eyes everyone is more attractive and entertaining than their ""real"" versions not to mention the fact that her ""Other Mother"" makes mouth-watering meals and anticipates Coralines every wish. Skeptical at first Coraline nevertheless keeps returning. When things become untenable at home she even warms to the idea of staying there - despite warnings from Wybie and a feral cat (Keith David) who can move between the worlds that there is a horrifying legacy behind the scenes. Once Coraline realizes its a facade (Other Mother is really an evil spider-witch who tempts lonely children and imprisons their souls) its too late to back out. Her parents have been captured and she must rescue them. As the alternate world starts to break down the animation becomes increasingly surreal until the fake world becomes a web-like black-and-white grid (surprise Other Mother is an animator too). Like Selicks Nightmare Coraline features perfect music in particular a spooky mournful childrens choir and songs by They Might Be Giants. Although fairytale art and cinema references abound Coraline is thoroughly and excitingly original - and quite possibly the best 3-D movie ever made.

A portal in the rambling Pink Palace Apartments where theyve moved leads Coraline to a parallel residence where she finds her ""Other"" parents. They treat her infinitely better. At first. While food spoils in her real parents fridge this family dishes up a kid gourmands pleasures. Her Other Father gleefully bangs out ditties on a piano. Theres another notable difference Coralines Other Mom and Other Dad -- and every other being on this side of the corridor -- have black buttons for eyes. The only exception is a mangy cat (Keith David) who like Coraline travels between the worlds. Its eerie stuff. At times ""Coraline"" (adapted from a Neil Gaiman novel) feels like a primer for future Goth kids everywhere. Maybe this shouldnt surprise because director Henry Selick helmed ""The Tim Burtons Nightmare Before Christmas."" Here the writer-director and his gifted animators impress with stop-motion detail. Yet ""Coraline"" is short on delight. And the 3-D tricks are for kids. Overenunciating tenants Miss Spink and Miss Forcible (Brit comedy pair Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders) and strongman Mr. Bobinsky (Ian McShane) go some way in injecting amusement into this far from absolutely fabulous yarn. The problem for Coraline -- character and movie -- is her folks. Even when Aunt Em and Uncle Henry left Dorothy to her own devices we understood that the farm was a demanding undertaking. Coralines parents (voiced in both realms by Teri Hatcher and John Hodgman) present a less sympathetic we dare to say dismaying portrait of parenting especially motherhood. And its hard not to see Coralines treatment of equally lonesome oddster Wybie as an example of modeling gone wrong.

Hes found perfect source material in Neil Gaimans book about a lonely little girl who discovers a secret world as she explores the dusty old house into which she and her distracted and distant parents have moved. Movie Information CoralineRatingShowtimes | Official site | TrailerDirector Henry SelickActors The voices of Dakota Fanning Teri Hatcher and Ian McShaneRun time 100 minutesMPAA rating PG (for scary elements)Synopsis While exploring her new home a girl named Coraline (Dakota Fanning) discovers a secret door behind which lies an alternate world that closely mirrors her own but in many ways is better.More movies from GuideLive.com3-D technology is the hot and happening toy in Hollywood and Coraline makes a compelling argument that it may be more than just a flashy marketing ploy. In Coraline we are light years beyond silly 3-D tricks of balls flying out at the audience. Watching this movie is like flipping through a pop-up book Its full of wonderful and sometimes startling surprises.While parents of young children should know that Coraline is undeniably spooky it is never gratuitous or thoughtless in the jitters it stirs. Coraline is a sweet smart little girl who has been uprooted by her career-minded parents. Left on her own she discovers a passageway to a dream world where her ""other"" mother welcomes her with every wonderful thing Coraline could possibly want. Theres a reason this movies tagline is ""Be careful what you wish for"" as Coraline soon discovers.Scary sights - can there be a more preternaturally creepy image than buttons sewn over eyes? - mix seamlessly with images that are wonderfully weird or just flat-out beautiful The blooming of the midnight garden bursts across the screen like a fireworks display. Parents may need to give a reassuring squeeze now and then but Coraline is the best kind of childrens entertainment - smartly told and deeply felt. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Its not just the 3-D glasses that add an extra dimension to the horror and hilarity of Coraline. For those who cant see themselves forking over hard cash to stare at a cartoon about an 11-year-old brat (Dakota Fanning voices Coraline) whose neglectful parents (Teri Hatcher John Hodgman) move her to a remote part of Oregon let me say this Director Henry Selick the magic man behind The Nightmare Before Christmas did the dazzling stop-motion animation. Neil Gaiman (Sandman) a rock star among graphic novelists wrote the story. And if that doesnt grab you think of what Japanese anime genius Hayao Miyazaki did with another little-girl story in the Oscar-winning Spirited Away. Coraline isnt in that class but Selick and Gaiman will take you -- and Coraline -- for a certified wild ride. Secret doors lead to an alternative universe where parents and toys only seem to be better versions. Like Alice Coraline discovers a Wonderland filled with surreal characters and dark implications that make a kid grow up quick. OK sensitive tykes may be scared shitless. But those who tough it out with this twisted trippy adventure in impure imagination will only be the better for it.

Repeat. You just might get it. You just might. Get it? Over her perilous journey into wish fulfillment Coraline Jones the very curious heroine of Henry Selicks shivery fairy tale in stop-motion animation learns that more tears are shed over answered prayers than unanswered ones. A macabre mystery for children and a cautionary tale for their folks Coraline is a yarn - twisty knotty taut - about a perennially bored girl whose parents are too preoccupied with work to pay her much mind. Coraline (not Caroline as she is the first to correct you) wishes for a different Mom and Dad parents who would close their laptops open the toy box and cook real meals not just vegan glop. One wouldnt want to keep up with these Joneses who live in a Victorian boardinghouse that might have been designed by Gomez Addams before it was quartered into bizarro flats. Two dog-fancying eccentrics elderly actresses with packs of terriers living and stuffed cohabit one. A Russian circus strongman his army of trained mice and lots of stinky cheese reside in another. The Joneses (voices of Teri Hatcher and John Hodgman) new arrivals occupy the third. The fourth apartment is empty. But when Coraline (voice of Dakota Fanning) finds a key to a passageway between the Jones place and the one presumed vacant she discovers her dream parents there. The dream flat looks larger swanker and sunnier than the cramped drab move-in where she and her stressed-out parents reside. Coralines ""other mother"" cheery and slim presides over the stove and serves up breakfasts of tasty sausages. Her ""other father"" is demonstrative composes music instead of plant-catalog copy and seeds a magic garden of iridescent blooms expressly for Coraline to play amongst. Except for the fact that they have black buttons where their eyes should be her dream parents are perfect. Or are they? Selicks adaptation of Neil Gaimans primally charged saga is The Wizard of Oz of stop-motion as deeply unsettling as the flying monkeys in that family classic. The filmmaker is the gifted if somewhat ghoulish talent behind The Nightmare Before Christmas and his new movie is suitable for brave kids who are at least age 10 and like their stories dark. The film fine-tunes its eerie tone during a credits sequence where Selick focuses on a stylized doll (a rag doll or the voodoo kind?). It is gutted then restitched its stuffing replaced. One might say Selick takes the stuffing out of the doll then scares the stuffing out of the audience. Conceived in and shot in 3-D Coraline makes excellent use of the retro-modern effect when it takes the audience through Coralines rabbit hole kind of like a vacuum hose into the elongated abode of the Other Mother and Father. The films Moderne visuals - like the big-headed big-eyed slim-bodied figures of Jazz Age cartoonist John Held Jr. - have the color and elasticity of Silly Putty. It would take a lot more space than my allotment here to give a fine-grain description of Coralines deeper themes. In broad strokes it is a story about how children idolize and vilify their parents often wishing for better cards but ultimately learning to play the hand theyre dealt. Is it premature to assign it classic status? Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

Starring Dakota Fanning Teri Hatcher Dawn French Jennifer Saunders Ian McShane Director Henry Selick Running time 140 Release Opened Feb 6 2009  Editorial Review As we consume ever more sophisticated forms of animation its easy to lose sight of the emotional connections we seek under all the technological fireworks.When you watch ""Coraline"" its easy to admire its imaginative fusion of low tech and high. But with stereoscopic 3-D high definition and computer-generated effects added to the equation the movie becomes supercharged with in-your-face palpability. (Find a theater showing the movie in 3-D for the full experience; most theaters will show it in the 2-D format.) We feel as if we could reach out and caress the characters smoothly rounded faces or tweak the lacquered strands of their shiny hair. The problem is we just dont want to hug them.The movie adapted from Neil Gaimans enormously successful book of the same name follows 11-year-old Coraline (voiced by Dakota Fanning) whose wish to replace the adults in her life leads to a nightmarish experience in a parallel universe. She finds herself in another world where charming replicas of her parents invite her to live with them. Theres a major hitch of course. Coralines ""Other Mother"" (Teri Hatcher) makes her a prisoner and demands unyielding devotion.For all its visual delights however ""Coraline"" remains more an engaging spectacle than a connective drama.That is chiefly because of the writing. Director-writer Henry Selick doesnt reach for the kind of universality that would enrich the movie.Its a shame because Fannings performance is the movies most emotionally persuasive element. Her assured modulations from cheeky to sweet from bored to anguished should have been part of a bigger deeper movie. Unfortunately the screenplay is one humanistic rewrite away from realizing that. Animations great purpose isnt merely to build superhighways to imagined worlds. Its to show us new footpaths to the human heart.-- Desson Thomson (Feb. 6 2009)Contains scary images mild profanity and suggestive humor.

Share Tweet In Hollywood virtually any screen success is slavishly copied to the point where a horde of major studios--Disney included--have followed Pixar and DreamWorks into CGI hoping that the medium alone accounts for the box-office bounty of Toy Story 2 and Shrek. So why didnt The Nightmare Before Christmass massive cult following spark a similar flood of morbidly funny stop-motion movies all grabbing after that phat Nightmare loot? Maybe Nightmare director Henry Selick set the bar too high with his focus on impeccable craft and astonishingly intricate design. But while the 16 years since his last stop-motion film havent seen any feature-length competition except Corpse Bride he hasnt lowered his standards. His second fully stop-motion animated feature Coraline instead reaches even higher and the results are nothing short of magical. The story drawn from Neil Gaimans short novel of the same name follows a snappish snarky girl named Coraline whose writer parents whisk her away to a countryside boarding house then promptly ignore her. While sulking her days away she finds a passageway to an alternate world in which her oddball neighbors distracted parents and dull surroundings all exist as wonder-filled mirror-opposites focused entirely on entertaining and impressing her. She quickly becomes addicted to the other world but naturally theres a price to pay for admission starting with the fact that the mirror-world folk all have buttons for eyes and shes expected to sacrifice her eyes to the needle as well. Selicks script plays up the colorful fantasy possibilities of Gaimans perfect world in a series of amazing sequences where mechanical mice independently mobile flowers and hideously near-naked old ladies perform for Coralines pleasure. But he also taps into a playfully Burton-esque streak of delicious dread thats as much Beetlejuice as Nightmare. Gaiman poised the story--one of his tightest and slyest--at the nightmarish border of traditional fairy tales and Selick expands it while respecting its strong characters and eerie tone. He brings it to life as a piece of stunningly mobile art a lovingly detailed beautifully constructed clockwork contraption with CGI fluidity and handmade soul. Like Selicks Nightmare it demands repeat viewings for the craft alone. Also like Nightmare it seems like an act that no one could possibly follow except maybe Selick himself.

"Coraline travels a wondrous dark journey thats definitely not for little ones - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search Home Delivery HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsHomesLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies MOVIE REVIEW Coraline Alice in Freudland Coraline travels a wondrous dark journey thats definitely not for little ones By Ty Burr Globe Staff / February 6 2009 Email| Print| Single Page| | Text size - + Good news for family psychiatrists across the land ""Coraline"" is opening today which means on Monday theyll have a whole new clientele of traumatized young children whose parents saw the PG rating and thought this was the latest ""Kung Fu Panda.""It is not. A darkly invigorating stop-motion tour down the rabbit hole of childhood anxieties ""Coraline"" is a movie only Wednesday Addams could love. Well Wednesday and anyone who loves her; if you have a 10-and-up whos drawn to alt-comics smart books dark clothing and general pop culture subversion the movie will be his or her Wonderland. (That age group includes grown-ups of course.)Still allow me to repeat Do not take a 5-year-old to ""Coraline"" unless your health plan covers therapy. Henry Selick the mad-genius puppetmaster behind ""Tim Burtons The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and ""James and the Giant Peach"" has brought Neil Gaimans 2002 cult novella to the screen with almost all its playful psychodrama intact. This is ""The Corpse Bride"" with teeth Bruno Bettelheim retooled for the multiplex a nightmare of daft and creative consequence.I really liked it.Coraline (voiced by Dakota Fanning) is an only child whose parents writers both have moved her to a creepy old multifamily house in the middle of nowhere. Flat-headed blue-haired sardonic without being a pill about it the girl is bored and mother (Teri Hatcher) and father (John Hodgman) keep shunting her aside until they can meet their deadlines. Which as any writer will tell you is never.Guided by a shaggy-haired neighbor boy (a character not in the book voiced by Robert Bailey Jr.) Coraline discovers a secret tunnel behind a bricked-up door; it quivers like an expectant intestine. This leads not as you might think to John Malkovichs head but to a place even stranger a parallel universe in which her parents are lovely and attentive flowers talk and everyone has buttons for eyes. Sounds charming but a sense of unease persists especially when the Other Mother (Hatcher again) offers Coraline a deal. Sew buttons on your eyes and you can live with us forever.Gaiman (who last month won a Newbery Award for 2008s ""The Graveyard Book"") knows exactly what hes about with this fusion of Lewis Carroll and Sigmund Freud and Selick brings it into the mainstream without sanding off too many of the books eccentricities. Coralines neighbors are a delightfully baroque crew in and out of the Otherworld a spindly Russian acrobat (Ian McShane); two dotty round actresses (Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French) with an army of stuffed Scotties; a cat that speaks in the superior tones of Keith David.I only wish Fanning and Hatcher had brought more individuality to their vocal performances. The actresses are fine but only fine and their broad earnest nonregional accents are the closest ""Coraline"" comes to normal. At the same time neither Fanning nor Hatcher really has to bring the funk since the characters do it for them.Scratch its colorful loop-de-loop surface and the story is both elemental and rare an epic psychic battle between a mother and her daughter for acceptance recognition and space. The Other Mother is eventually revealed to Coraline (and us) as the evil harridan all teenage girls know their moms to be right after theyve slammed the bedroom door but theres a pathos to the older womans neediness thats unexpectedly moving. Better Coralines real mother is proved to be just that real flawed loving.(Wheres Dad in all this? Hes a kindhearted doofus like so many fathers in films and on TV. Since the main drama is between Coraline and her mom though hes forgiven and anyway how can you dislike a character who opens his mouth and sings in the voice of John Linnell of They Might Be Giants?)Selick has opened Gaimans prose up and daubed it with fantastical hues and skewed visual ideas; the movies not as complete a vision as ""James and the Giant Peach"" but it keeps you wondering whats coming around the corner next. ""Coraline"" indulges us with the sort of visual razzle-dazzle modern family entertainments are required to have like a funny and surreal production number for the aging actresses (and their Scotties). Yet because the technique here is stop-motion clay animation - an old-world hands-on craft with none of the eerie smoothness of computer rendering - the film feels warm and fussed-over. Its the product of humans instead of machines. Like its heroine and like its audience it has a soul.(A final note ""Coraline"" is being released in selected theaters in 3-D. Having screened that version Im pleased to say that very few things are tossed skimmed poked or spewed out at the audience and that in general the 3-D technology is used to give shape to the films world rather than assault us with it. The result is a gentle dimensionality that compliments the films dark and spiky sense of childs play.)Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2009 Globe Newspaper Company.

"Coraline stars the voices of Dakota Fanning Teri Hatcher Keith David John Hodgman Ian McShane - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Coraline stars the voices of Dakota Fanning Teri Hatcher Keith David John Hodgman Ian McShaneRating 31/2 stars (good-excellent)February 06 2009|By Michael Phillips TRIBUNE CRITICCORALINE  1/2""Coraline"" may not be for all tastes and its certainly not for all kids given its macabre premise. But writer-director Henry Selicks animated feature advances the stop-motion animation genre through that most heartening of attributes quality. It pulls audiences into a meticulously detailed universe familiar in many respects wacked and menacing in many others.Unlike other recent films shot in 3-D (""Bolt"" comes to mind) this one takes rich advantage of the process and does so without turning into a series of ""gotcha"" shots. ""Coraline"" has wit as well as fright in its dark corners and Selicks adaptation of the Neil Gaiman novella stays fairly faithful to the story. Its more streamlined and far more rewarding than the ungainly ""Stardust"" the previous Gaiman fantasy to reach the screen. Would the 8-year-old me have fallen for ""Coraline""? Maybe not. Like my own 8-year-old at that age I was more into comedy than anything designed to give me the comic willies. But the adult me is a big fan.In a film critically dependent on tunnel imagery theres a moment early on in ""Coraline"" crystallizing the rightness of Selicks touch. The blue-haired quizzically intelligent preteen heroine voiced well and earnestly by Dakota Fanning has discovered a tiny door in the wall of her immense ramshackle small-town Oregon home recently purchased by her preoccupied parents. The first time she opens it its just a bricked-up wall. The second time -- and this is the moment -- a magical pink-and-blue tunnel expands before her widening eyes. If you see ""Coraline"" in a theater equipped with 3-D and you should the sight really is something.Originally set in England Gaimans story works in a similar way taking a simple premise and leading us ever further down a rabbit hole. Coraline discovers a parallel universe at the other end of the tunnel a brighter more inviting version of the same house and her same parents. Here alls well all the time The food tastes better the garden sprouts garishly colored amazements on cue and a miniature train delivers a gravy boat atop a splendidly laid dining-room table.The entertainment is splendid as well ranging from a trained mouse circus to music hall turns performed onstage at a gorgeous 19th Century vaudeville house patronized by Scottish terriers.From the start the film plays its 11-year-old heroines loneliness and dislocation for real (without going for cheap pathos) so that the storys shift into a darker more sinister key feels natural. Other Mother and Other Father are much like Coralines real parents except for their eyes made out of buttons. Their interest in Coraline comes with a catch and the girl soon learns she cannot simply go back to her drab former life when she pleases.Selick directed ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and in a combination of live action and stop-motion animation ""James and the Giant Peach."" Certainly ""Coraline"" wears many influences starting with Tim Burton and his taste for graveyard pranksterism. In the opening sequence which owes a lot to the animation of the Quay Brothers a telltale Coraline doll is restuffed given button eyes and sent out into a dark void. The mouse circus evokes the old George Pal Puppetoons and composer Bruno Coulais excellent score recalls Danny Elfmans hurdy-gurdy melodies from ""Nightmare.""It all works because Selick doesnt believe in the hard sell. You dont feel beaten up by the peril here and the design collaborators -- cinematographer Pete Kozachik effects supervisor Brian Vant Hul animation head Anthony Scott among others -- respect the mechanics of stop-motion even as they embrace the depth of field offered by the 3-D framework. In the real-world sequences Coralines life is depicted in muted colors; when she discovers the Other World her depth of field deepens as does ours. Characters from one realm reappear in the other ""Wizard of Oz""-style and the voice work is flavorsome in both. Teri Hatchers Mother John HodgmansFather Ian McShanes Russian mouse-tender and especially Fannings forceful but sympathetic reading of Coraline serve the story well.The movie isnt flawless. Coraline is given a friend Wybie she didnt have in the book and he steals some of Coralines thunder at the climax. I suppose the film is 5 or 10 minutes too long. Yet halfway through I was already eager to revisit certain images from the first half again. Thats a sure sign youre watching an adventurous movie with brains personality a look and a knack for inducing shivers even as youre reminded to appreciate the parents you have as opposed to the parents of your dreams.- - -MPAA rating PG (for thematic elements scary images some language and suggestive humor)Running time 140Opening FridayStarring the voices of Dakota Fanning (Coraline); Teri Hatcher (Mother and Other Mother); Jennifer Saunders (Miss Spink); Dawn French (Miss Forcible); Keith David (Cat); John Hodgman (Father and Other Father); Ian McShane (Mr. Bobinsky); Robert Bailey Jr. (Wybie Lovat)Written and directed by Henry Selick based on the novel by Neil Gaiman; photographed by Pete Kozachik; animation supervised by Anthony Scott; music by Bruno Coulais; visual effects supervised by Brian Vant Hul; edited by Christopher Murrie and Ronald Sanders; produced by Bill Mechanic Claire Jennings Selick and Mary Sandell.

Coraline makes a convincing case that they should about-face from computer graphics and invest in stop motion. Directed by Henry Selick of The Nightmare Before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach Coraline is lush with textures--cotton puff hair dusty windshields ribbons that unfold towards the camera and bugs that squirt real goo; in 3D Selicks world feels so reach-out-and-touchable its realer than real (and more immersive than any pixels to date). Neil Gaiman this generations Brothers Grimm wrote the script and original book about a restless girl (Dakota Fanning) who escapes her suffocatingly dull parents (Teri Hatcher and John Hodgman) through a hidden door that leads to an alternative reality where her Other Mother stuffs her full of cake and wonderment before trying to replace her eyes with eerie black buttons. What follows is an all-ages fantasia (as in older folks should go) with Russian acrobats carnivorous plants dancing mice taxidermied terriers and a knockout vaudeville show starring Coralines batty spinster neighbors Miss Forcible and Miss Spink (voiced by Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders of the Brit comedy French and Saunders). Sure theres no subtext about saving the planet but for 2009 Pixars got to play catch-up. (Amy Nicholson) 0 Comments Be the first to comment You must be logged in to post a comment.

Comments click to enlarge Coraline Video Rated PG  100 minutes  2009 Tim Burton who wrote the story for The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) has since topped it with another animated chiller Corpse Bride (2005) while Henry Selick who directed Nightmare has been struggling to better it ever since. Like his James and the Giant Peach (1996) this is adapted from a popular childrens fantasy--Neil Gaimans 2002 horror novella Coraline which won the Hugo and Nebula awards. The intrepid Coraline frustrated with her parents after they move her to a new town discovers a portal to an alternate universe where everyone has buttons sewn over their eyes. Its the first stop-motion feature filmed entirely in stereoscopic 3-D and the technique makes Selicks artwork even more wondrously creepy. The problem is Gaimans story which keeps accumulating otherworldly mythology but doesnt establish a clear line of action in the home stretch (2009). Among the voice talent are Dakota Fanning Teri Hatcher John Hodgman and Ian McShane. By J.R.

Well that plus the minor detail of Coralines rabbit hole which looks more like a papier-mache umbilical cord that extends from a small door concealed by living room wallpaper. And instead of a grinning Cheshire cat here we have a melancholic black stray which speaks -- as cats are able to on the other side of that wall -- in the distinctive tenor of stalwart John Carpenter sideman Keith David.Nor does the movies air of genial weirdness end there In Coralines button-eyed alterna-universe life is a nonstop carnival where Coralines work-obsessed writer parents are transformed into a pair of gregarious playmates while her upstairs and downstairs neighbors -- an 8-foot-tall Russian circus acrobat (Ian McShane) and a pair of spinster chorus girls (the immortal British comedy duo of Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders) -- are restored to their youthful glory. Instead of slimy good-for-you Swiss chard dinner is a kingly feast of oven-roasted chicken mashed potatoes and a literal gravy train. And of course you can eat as much dessert as you want. Indeed everything is so practically perfect in every way that Coralines only regret is the nightly slumber that inevitably returns her to the slate-colored murk of ordinary life. Until it doesnt anymore. Which is when all the enchantments of Coralines wonderland begin to creak and crack and spill forth their menacing innards.Based on a 2002 novel by that prince of kid-lit darkness (and 2008 Newberry Medal winner) Neil Gaiman Coraline takes root in one of the most primal of childrens fantasies -- the desire to escape the clutch of parental authority for a life of boundless wish-fulfillment and adventure. And like her many literary and cinematic avatars from Alice and Dorothy to Jacques Rivettes Celine and Julie Coraline is soon to learn that one must always be careful what one wishes for. This is familiar terrain for both Gaiman (whose original screenplay for the 2005 film MirrorMask centered around a teenage girls journey through a grim parallel world) and Selick (whose 1996 stop-motion adaptation of Roald Dahls James and the Giant Peach remains a modern classic of childhood make-believe at odds with grown-up insolence). But so deep run both mens imaginations that Coraline is that rare case in which familiarity never risks breeding contempt.Coraline Jones isnt the pluckiest or most ingratiating sprite ever to take center stage in a childrens film and her (mis)adventures arent especially novel but Coraline is still a consistent splendor to behold. With all of the tools of the 21st-century CGI paintbox at his disposal Selick (who made his feature-directing debut on the Tim Burton-produced The Nightmare Before Christmas) prefers to dwell in the realm of stop-motion where one is restricted to those things that can be modeled with metal and latex balls and sockets and made to move not by binary code but by human hands. (For a glimpse of the process stay in your seat for the movies brief post-end-credits coda.) That lends Coraline a wonderfully tactile aesthetic befitting a story that takes place not a long time ago in a faraway land but rather in a draughty old boarding house in Ashland Oregon.

Sep. 13 600pm Selick avoids using the movies 3-D canvas for ostentatious ""gotcha"" effects instead employing the enhanced perspective the way a painter might adding subtle details of height and distance which would be diminished in the standard 2-D frame as he slowly envelops us in Coralines dueling realities. Best of all he understands that the most affecting fables are those in which sweet dreams turn out to be trapdoors concealing nightmares.

Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review Coraline -- 5 out of 5 stars Coraline and Other Mother Focus Features Coraline (voiced by Dakota Fanning) finds Other Mothers (voiced by Teri Hatcher) snack treat to be distasteful. Coraline (voiced by Dakota Fanning) finds Other Mothers (voiced by Teri Hatcher) snack treat to be distasteful. (Focus Features) Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Dark magical and endlessly inventive Coraline is the latest stop-motion animated marvel from Henry Selick whose Nightmare Before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach are gold standards for the style.Where most of todays animated films are like video games -- snappy slick computer-assisted/photo-realistic wonders designed for the ADD set -- Selick is still playing with toy trains telling quiet funny and sometimes disturbing tales for kids using dolls hand-built miniature sets and great voice actors. Theres a little digital effect here and there. But Selicks movies are best in their unmatched tactile sense of reality -- shooting it in 3-D only heightens that. Coraline based on a story by award-winning writer Neil Gaiman (Stardust) is about a girl who looks to be about 11 an only child who has moved to a remote boarding house with her word-processing parents. The adults slave away over a gardening catalog they produce too busy to give Coraline (Dakota Fanning) a moments thought or to cook her a decent meal.The kid entertains herself. She has to. Theres not much a girl can do with that pot-bellied trapeze artist (voiced by Ian McShane) upstairs or those plump bawdy and doddering burlesque dancers (Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French) in the basement. Theres a mysterious door in the wall that gets Coralines attention. When she opens it she wanders into her ""other"" life with her ""better"" parents a mom (Teri Hatcher) who cooks wondrous meals and dotes on her and a father who whips off ditties about his Coraline on the piano. Coraline may wake up in a dreary dull ""real"" world. But at night she can slip off to her own personal Oz where the colors are Van Gogh splashy; the flowers are playful; and that stray cat who wanders through both worlds now speaks with the warning growl of Keith David.""You probably think this other world is a dream come true"" the cat cautions. ""But youre wrong.""For one thing all the alternate people have buttons for eyes.Coraline must not let her real eyes be fooled by the promise of a shiny idyllic life in button-eye land and awaken to the menace packed in ""your BETTER moms"" iron-fisted rule over this alternate reality. The voices especially a vamping Russian-accented McShane and British comedy duo French amp; Saunders re-united for this film are simply perfect. Fanning was recorded in the last blush of adolescence.Selick stages the third acts chases and monstrous 3-D menace (this may be too much for anybody under 5) with style and wit.But its the pacing and look of Coraline an amble through a lovingly realized model-makers paradise that makes the film stand out. A VW Beetle shown here even has a perfectly smudged windshield. For all the polished electrons of the latest works from Pixar Blue Sky or DreamWorks Selick and Co. show that stop-motion animation still looks moves and feels like nothing at all the computer animators terrabytes can mimic.

But what if you dont have those comfortable relationships in real life to begin with? The appeal of a fantasy world an alternate reality would be substantial. And if that turns out to be a cruel trick? Youre in trouble. That alternate reality is where the title character in Coraline finds herself. The film is imaginative original and scary enough that small children will probably have nightmares of alternate dimensions for days. But thats not necessarily a deal-breaker. Its not the role of director Henry Selick who also wrote the screenplay based on Neil Gaimans book to decide whats appropriate for the audiences children. Its his role to make the most entertaining movie possible and hes done a pretty good job of it. The stop-motion animation used by Selick in his earlier films The Nightmare Before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach is fantastic. And the film is shot in 3-D giving the backgrounds more texture (the poking-stuff-at-the-audience-because-we-can is thankfully limited though some of the scenes are too dark to get the full three-dimensional effect). The story drags in the middle and is quite frightening. But its also quite enjoyable in an Addams Family kind of way. Coraline (voice of Dakota Fanning) has just moved with her parents to a creepy old apartment house complete with eccentric neighbors. Theres Mr. Bobinsky (Ian McShane) who trains jumping mice. There is a pair of fat ladies downstairs Miss Spink (Jennifer Saunders) and Miss Forcible (Dawn French). Then theres Wybie (Robert Bailey Jr.) the grandson of the weird houses owner who pals around with a feral cat (Keith David) and bugs Coraline to no end. Wybie gives Coraline a doll he took from his grandmother that looks suspiciously like her. Why? She asks her parents (Teri Hatcher and John Hodgman) but theyre far too caught up in writing a gardening catalog to be bothered by something so distracting as a daughter. So its no wonder that when Coraline finds a secret door she opens it and wanders through turning up in the same house only . . . better. Her parents - her ""other mother"" and ""other father"" - are doting attentive catering to her every whim. Theres just one thing Their eyes are buttons. And ""other Wybie"" cant talk; other Mother thought Coraline would like him better that way. The cat on the other hand can talk in this world and he has alarming things to say. Other Mother isnt quite the dream mom she seems - something that becomes apparent when she tells Coraline that to stay in this world forever she too will have to have buttons sewn on in place of her eyes. From there its a race to escape and to save her real parents who suddenly dont look so bad in comparison. It takes a little long to get to this point when its so clearly where the story is headed. But the mind-melding attempt to get home is exciting and certainly creative. Tales of alternate worlds are always fascinating when done right and Coraline fits that description.

And of course adults regularly visit imaginary worlds too often with psychotherapists as travel agents. Add to those interested parties the millions who love the fantasy-rich literature of Neil Gaiman and those who adore the dreamscape artistry of Nightmare Before Christmas filmmaker Henry Selick and you have the audience for Coraline everybody. This thrilling stop-motion animated adventure is a high point in Selicks career of creating handcrafted wonderlands of beauty blended with deep disconcerting creepiness. The story is familiar to those who have read Gaimans award-winning 2002 book and appeals to all who previously followed Alice down a rabbit hole or stepped with Lucy through a closet door to visit Narnia. Coraline Jones (voiced by Dakota Fanning) moves with her distracted parents (Teri Hatcher and John Hodgman) to an apartment in an eccentric old house. The tenants are similarly unusual. Theres a pair of gaga British ladies of the stage (the Absolutely Fabulous comic duo of Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French) and a Russian circus gymnast (Ian McShane) whos all skinny blue limbs and big blue belly. But Coraline is bored and feels ignored until she discovers a secret door in her bedroom. In the way of fearless children she enters. And in the bizarro world on the other side shes greeted by her Other Mother (also Hatcher) -- an impossibly perfect version of her real parent better in every way except for eyes that are dead black buttons. Theres a more charming dead-eyed Other Father too and indeed more magnificent versions of everyone she left behind?until that is the danger behind the magnificence is revealed. Book purists will be satisfied even with the movie-only addition of a playmate for Coraline a yakkety boy whose ""improvement"" in the Other World is shocking indeed. And Selick fans will beam -- especially those who seek out theaters offering 3-D screenings. Stop-motion in 3-D wow Theres magic through the end credits. So dont rush out the exit door.

Eerily inhabiting the netherworld where a young girls wildest dreams become her cruelest nightmares ""Coraline"" is a dark delight. Although it coarsens some of the details in Neil Gaimans popular 2002 childrens horror novel this eccentric and deliriously inventive fantasy finds stop-motion auteur Henry Selick scaling new heights of ghoulish whimsy buoyed by a haunting score that works its own macabre magic. Probably too frightening for very small tots the PG-rated Focus Features toon deserves to be seen in all its bigscreen 3-D glory but should also achieve family-favorite status on homevid. ""Coraline"" may benefit from the added synergy of an upcoming Off Broadway musical (slated for a May 6 world premiere) and a videogame (released Jan. 27) featuring voicework by three of the films thesps Dakota Fanning Keith David and Robert Bailey Jr. The captivatingly creepy yarn also has inspired an Italian short film an Irish puppet show a Swedish play and a P. Craig Russell graphic novel -- not bad for a book that sprung from a series of bedtime stories Gaiman told his daughters in the 1990s. Like the novel the film functions as a crafty cautionary tale on the perils of getting what you want whether its a pair of gloves or a new family. Yet the dazzling colors and unhinged imagination of Selicks visual palette also have the effect of rendering ""Coralines"" fantasy world that much more eye-ticklingly and dangerously seductive. Small but spunky with blue hair and stick-like limbs Coraline Jones (engagingly voiced by Fanning) is an only child who feels neglected by her garden-catalog-writing parents (Teri Hatcher John Hodgman). The three have just moved into a ramshackle old boarding house whose other tenants include two faded actresses Miss Spink (Jennifer Saunders) and Miss Forcible (Dawn French) and a Russian acrobat (Ian McShane) who has his own rodent circus. Where Gaiman tossed off these peculiar supporting characters with deadpan drollery the pic somewhat ill-advisedly turns them into colorful almost Busby Berkeley-esque sideshow attractions that are simultaneously dazzling and wearying. Selicks script also saddles Coraline with a goth-nerd sidekick Wybie (Bailey) a figure of eventual dramatic importance but questionable comic value. The film is on surer footing once Coraline unlocks a mysterious door in the wall and finds herself in a parallel dimension that looks an awful lot like home emphasis on the awful. This haunted house is impeccably maintained by Coralines ""other mother"" a dead ringer for her real mother only shes cheery and attentive and probably smells like cookies -- oh and she has black buttons where her eyes should be. Clearly somethings not quite right here. And when the other mother tells Coraline she must live there forever and have buttons sewn into her own eyes (""Soon youll see things our way"") the chill is unmistakable. Coralines other mother likes to play games and create twisted facsimiles of real-world people and places; in that respect she and Selick have a lot in common. While this is Selicks first toon not produced by Tim Burton (after ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and ""James and the Giant Peach"") its very much in keeping with that filmmakers darkly funny spirit; even the production design bears shades of Burtons ""Beetlejuice."" The use of stop-motion as opposed to CG or hand-drawn 2-D animation is inspired; with its slightly stilted frame-by-frame movements and tactile stylized puppets the film never lets one forget that its an imperfectly hand-crafted marvel -- a world the other mother herself might have stitched together. As Coraline and a helpful cat (David) engage their enemy in a battle of wits the film keeps bursting its stylistic boundaries A scene set at the outer reaches of this make-believe world harks back to the Looney Tunes classic ""Duck Amuck"" and a later sequence brilliantly visualizes the idea of Coraline as a fly trapped in her captors web. As a visual experience ""Coraline"" is enriched immeasurably by its sophisticated 3-D engine which is after subtler more immersive effects -- sweeping camera movements delineation of foreground and background -- than the mere gimmick of having objects pop out from the screen. Riffing on her ""Desperate Housewives"" role with a devious sense of fun Hatcher (with the help of some nifty character morphing by the pics animators) makes the other mother a villain worthy of the many evil stepmoms that have preceded her. But the films most indelible asset is French composer Bruno Coulais score a feverish singsong concoction that evokes a girls everyday boredom as well as the demons lurking just beyond the limits of her imagination.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review What You See Is What You Get The stunning oddly soulless film of Neil Gaimans Coraline. Plus Liam Neeson awesome butt-kicker. By David Edelstein Published Feb 1 2009 ShareThis (Photo Courtesy of Focus Features) The film adaptation of a book can be nearly perfect on its own terms and yet subtly off as in Henry Selicks exquisite entrancing very occasionally enervating movie of Neil Gaimans Coraline. Frame by frame its a treat. Selick employs old-fashioned stop-motion animation (Yay Puppets) enhanced by computers and extended to the bridge of your nose by state-of-the-art 3-D (in roughly half of all theaterschoose one of those); Bruno Coulaiss music pirouettes nimbly between child-choir enchantment and Night on Bald Mountain dread. You should see itespecially if youre tired of boisterous animated joke-fests like Bolt and crave a bona fide fairy tale. I feel like a goblin under a bridge when I grumble but I could have done with a touch less entrancement and a touch more story. In his novel (which is stupendous) Gaiman devises an eerie variation on the familiar over-the-rainbow parable A lonely little girl transplanted to a rambling old country house and neglected by her parents discovers a tunnel in the wall that leads to a parallel universewhere she finds a nearly identical mother and father who dote on her. Indeed this new world seems to revolve around Coraline Goodies appear at her command mice serenade her flowers rearrange themselves to form her face. But there are hints of malevolence Her Other Mother (as the woman refers to herself) has black buttons in place of eyes and a widening streak of possessiveness. Gradually we discern the psychological truth. The Other Mothers overbearing love has nothing to do with the child and everything to do with her demonic need for control. Its a careful-what-you-wish-for tale with a powerful testimonial to self-reliance. Gaimans prose is plot-driven The prose is plain which makes the swerves into fantasy so disarming. Hes artful but hes not a stylist whereas Selick is all style. Breathtaking style to be sure. Working with the Japanese illustrator Tadahiro Uesugi Selick comes up with a look thats part Tim Burton (Coralines elongated house is right out of Beetlejuice) part Pinocchio. The sets are like dollhouses that open up and float you in. The puppets have wide smooth faces on stick legs and necks and their barely perceptible jerkiness makes the movie feel lovingly handmade. Coralines features under her turquoise hair are simple yet beautifully articulated Watch her face when she sees Other Mother for the first timeand how it contrasts with the less mobile masklike visage of the scarily familiar alien. As I drank in the phantasmagoria the surreal music-hall routine the flower dances the giant grasshopper ride the heroines endless prowls around artificial landscapes I kept wondering what I was missing. It might be as basic as emotional focus. The pace is barely varied and instead of becoming a spitfire detective (as in the book) Coraline drifts around in a daze. Selick saddles her with a playmatea curly-haired boy with a souped-up sci-fi-worthy scooterand her initial impatience with him makes no dramatic sense Its the lack of contact with kids that helps drive her into that alternate universe. Selick botches the climax by having the boy roar back and deprive Coraline of her ultimate triumph. Did he need a male character to keep this from being a you know girl picture? Selick has a great fantasy filmmakers artistry but he lacks that overflowing Geppetto-esque love that brings puppets to life. In Coraline hes woozy with his own lyricism. In Taken Liam Neeson plays Bryan Mills an exJason Bournelike spook who wants to make amends for being an absent dad to his 17-year-old daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) so he whines and pleads with his chilly ex (Famke Janssen) not to let her travel to Paris with her rich girlfriend. Its a bad world out there he insistsa bad bad world. You dont know. I know. Believe me. Ive seen things. You dont want to know. Dismissing him as a hysteric Kim jets to France and is promptlyI mean she doesnt get to peesnatched by Albanian sex-slavers for sale to sheikhs and sundry other wealthy sadists. This is where Dad gets to prove that he can karate-chop the windpipe of one Albanian while taking out three more with a paper clip a wad of gum and a hard stare. (I exaggerate but not by much.) The script by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen panders to macho American wet dreams that feel distinctly antiquated in the new age of American non-exceptionalism. And in a just universe the idea that rich white American virgins are the prime targets of sex-slavers would make tens of thousands of captive underage Asian girls rise up shouting That is the last straw I would leave it there except that Takenin the hands of director Pierre Morel (District B13) with Neeson in nearly every shotworks like gangbusters. The Frenchies have made the filet mignon of meathead vigilante movies. 1 2 Next Share this story...
