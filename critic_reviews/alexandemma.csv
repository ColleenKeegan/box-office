Comments Alex amp; Emma Desperate to get over his writing block so he can finish a novel collect 125000 from a publisher (director Rob Reiner) and pay off gambling debts to violent Cuban loan sharks a young author (Luke Wilson) hires a stenographer (Kate Hudson) who helps him along with her strong opinions. The novel set in 1924 follows the romantic adventures of an aspiring novelist (Wilson again) working for a French family as an English tutor and romancing first the childrens mother (Sophie Marceau) and in later versions her au pair (Hudson again) a character whose nationality keeps changing as the story is revised. The actors make this fun if you can overlook the ludicrous view of Jeremy Levens screenplay concerning how novels are written and what publishers generally pay for them--the true subject is writing silly Hollywood scripts like this one. 100 min.

But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

""Alex amp; Emma"" is a desperately slight romantic comedy marked by contrived romance and little comedy. A period-jumping tale of a struggling writer who finds his fictional work and his heart impacted by the stenographer to whom he dictates his novel this surprise-free trifle belongs to the ever-popular breed of love stories in which two people obviously meant for one another dont face up to the fact until the end. This coupled with an ad campaign that recalls ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and lack of any other contempo romances in a marketplace overwhelmed by heavy-ammo guy pix means this flyweight Warner Bros. release has a chance to rack up some sweet femme-driven B.O. in the busy midsummer period. Playing it safe with an eye to making some ""When Harry Met Sally""-like waves after his unloved last two features ""The Story of Us"" and ""Ghosts of Mississippi"" director Rob Reiner has turned out a confection as glossy as it is predictable. Roughly based on the circumstances of Dostoevskys writing of his novella ""The Gambler"" which was composed in 30 days under intense pressure from his publisher during which time the author fell in love with his stenographer script by Jeremy Leven (""Don Juan DeMarco"") begins with young novelist Alex Sheldon (Luke Wilson) being dangled out the window of his Boston loft by two Cuban gangsters who tell him he has 30 days to pay off his 100000 gambling debt. Despite his lack of an idea for his new tome Alex incredibly already has a deal in place that will pay him even more than that upon delivery of the manuscript but his publisher (Reiner) wont advance him anything until he has the book in hand. His laptop barbecued by the thugs Alex even more incredibly induces legal stenographer Emma Dinsmore (Kate Hudson) to take dictation from him for the month on spec. Whatever else one can say about ""Alex amp; Emma"" it is the least credible portrait of a writer working on heavy deadline to have appeared onscreen in living memory. Despite the convincing incentive to overcome the writers block or procrastination with which hes recently been afflicted Alex whose previous book was entitled ""Love Is Always Having to Say Youre Sorry"" maintains a mild laidback demeanor throughout as if he scarcely had a care in the world. Whether due to the script direction or Wilsons relaxed performance there is no urgency whatever to Alexs predicament and film would have benefited had Reiner at least invested the central situation with some suspense. As it is pic mostly consists of Alex and Emma sitting around the formers dingy digs (which look quite respectable and very back-lot from the outside) as Alex gradually spins a 1924-set tale of Adam Shipley a young writer much like himself (and also played by Wilson) working as a tutor to the children of a beautiful French woman Polina Delacroix (Sophie Marceau) who is summering on an island along the coast of Maine. Accustomed to the high life but short on funds Polina looks destined to marry unprepossessing moneybags John Shaw (David Paymer) but Adam becomes increasingly infatuated with the flirtatious vixen the more she toys with him. Main running gag of the opulently appointed ""fictional"" story strand is the appearance of Hudson as a succession of au pairs. After trying on different accents and outfits as Ylva the Swede Elsa the German and Eldora the Spaniard Hudson settles in as Emma from Philadelphia and here just as with Emma back in present-day Boston its just a matter of time until Adam/Alex wakes up to the charms of the young lady whos been right there for him all along. Minor laughs stem from Emmas suggestions and modifications to Alexs writing which briefly veers into gambling territory but mostly concerns Adams obsession with Polina played with glamorous hauteur by the ever-sexy Marceau. But the period scenes often bathed in brilliant sunlight have a brittle feel while the modern section lacks the basic credibility needed to invest any interest or emotion in them. With Wilson providing little energy the burden falls on Hudson to carry the picture and she fights an uphill battle to enliven things without resorting entirely to tricks. Thesp is trapped by the overwhelming artificiality of the enterprise but gives it a little zip no one else sees fit to provide. Lavishly decked out period scenes consciously evoke a ""Gatsby""-like ambiance especially in Shay Cunliffes pristine costumes and contrast strongly with Alexs grubby apartment. Music is cutesy.

Instead it feels wan and uninspired despite its likable cast. Kate Hudsons performance is humdrum in Alex amp; Emma. Rob Reiner directs this story of an angst-ridden novelist with writers block who must complete a book in 30 days or risk being killed by loan sharks to whom he owes 100000. Luke Wilson plays Alex the writer whose computer is destroyed when thugs tear up his dingy apartment. And even though that sounds improbable the plot quickly gets more far-fetched. Kate Hudsons Emma supposedly a smart girl thinks shes applying for a position in a law office. Thats because Alex inexplicably pretends hes an attorney. Even more mystifying is Emmas decision to take the job even though she wont be paid for a month -- and only then if her employer isnt killed first. Review of the movie Alex amp; Emma ( out of four) Stars Kate Hudson Luke Wilson Sophie Marceau David Paymer Director Rob Reiner Distributor Warner Bros. Rating PG-13 for sexual content and some language Opens Friday in selected cities The story that Alex dictates set in the 1920s on a fictional New England island seems as if it were written by an F. Scott Fitzgerald wannabe. But the film does take off when Alex begins to narrate the tale with Wilson and Hudson playing Adam and Anna key characters in the story within the story. Alex re-imagines Emma as a sympathetic au pair with whom Adam a struggling writer strikes up a friendship. Meanwhile Adam falls madly in love with Polina the gorgeous mother of two children he tutors. But Alex keeps revising Annas character changing her ethnicity from Swedish to German to Spanish to American. Hudson plays them all attempting each accent along the way but only her German works. Wilson has an endearing manner but hes not well-suited to the role. Hes best playing the easygoing boyfriend as in Legally Blonde. The role of a hypochondriac writer requires an edge a neurotic quality that try as he might boy-next-door Wilson doesnt have. One could picture John Cusack Ben Stiller or even David Duchovny in this role but Wilson seems too well-adjusted to convincingly pull it off. Hudson who was vivacious in How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days and winsome in Almost Famous is humdrum here. Her playful blonde is transformed into a drab brunette. Its not clear why unless its to contrast her earnest simplicity with the glamour and flirtatiousness of Alexs French ex-girlfriend (Sophie Marceau). And the filmmakers cant get a fix on Emmas character. In some scenes shes an intriguing free spirit reading the endings of books first and easily abandoning the notion of working for a stodgy law firm to take dictation for a flaky writer. In others she is conventional and banal. Though it has some mildly amusing moments (mostly in the visuals accompanying the novels narration) Alex amp; Emma is disappointing neither very romantic nor very comic.

Starring Kate Hudson and Luke Wilson. Directed by Rob Reiner. (PG-13. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Here we are in the 21st century and were right back to where we were at the start of the 20th in terms of the romantic ideal safety practicality making the smart choice. These days romantic comedy -- the only mainstream genre dealing with love -- comes with a message and the message is always the same. Dont trust impulse. Dont take chances. Lead with the head not the heart. Perhaps 100 years of diving in blindfolded have made people cynical or maybe just wise or careful. In any case the result is a movie like ""Alex amp; Emma"" a cute and amusing little romance that has all the fiery impetuosity of an egg sandwich. The people are pretty (Luke Wilson Kate Hudson Sophie Marceau) and the tone is bouncy and everythings OK -- except its not. Not really. Directed by Rob Reiner the movies claim to distinction is that it juggles two stories and two settings. Wilson plays Alex a novelist who has to finish a novel in 30 days in order to pay off loan sharks. He hires Emma (Hudson) a stenographer and dictates his novel to her. The movie alternates between scenes of them in Alexs apartment crafting the novel over the course of long work sessions and scenes from the novel itself. The first meeting of Alex and Emma is wretched even by the low standards of romantic comedy with Alex fainting (for no reason) and with a patch of looped dialogue that makes one wonder how awful the original had to be. The modern- day story suffers from the claustrophobic apartment setting and from the fussy one-note character of Emma while the story of the novel set in the 1920s is too absurd to stand alone. Yet -- there must be a word in botany for this -- the stories become stronger when grafted together. ""Alex amp; Emma"" is lighter than helium but its just sturdy enough to be pleasing. Wilson in a double role plays the protagonist of his novel a young writer who takes a summer job as tutor to a Frenchwomans children. The year is 1924 and the milieu is straight out of ""The Great Gatsby"" which Fitzgerald wrote that same year -- white linen suits palatial summer homes and glamorous people dripping money. Desperate the protagonist decides he needs money too real money and for that most Fitzgeraldian of reasons. He has become madly and instantly in love with a rich woman Polina (Marceau) the mother of his two students. With her hair in a dark Daisy Buchanan bob Marceau plays the ideal personification of the elusive woman of fantasy the unknowable and flawless beauty who is perhaps best known from a distance. Marceau gives the role some nice twists letting us see Polina as the hero sees her and as she really is manipulative and scheming transparent to anyone not love-struck. Its a witty performance. Hudson fares less well in the novel scenes incarnating a series of housekeepers (the character keeps changing) in what seems intended to be a showcase of her comic versatility. Her Swedish maid is loony enough to be funny but her German housekeeper is broad and embarrassing. Her director should have protected her. As for the apartment scenes theyre just two people sitting around talking and its pretty much the same conversation -- Emma doesnt like the Polina character but she likes all the housekeepers. And the movie seems to agree with her. Its ironic that ""Alex amp; Emma"" should evoke Fitzgerald a writer who above all else was about reaching for the dream for glamour for fantasy (even knowing its fantasy) no matter what the cost. No self-respecting Fitzgerald character would have had any trouble choosing between Sophie Marceau and Kate Hudson. There could be no choice -- hed only see Marceau. By contrast ""Alex amp; Emma"" celebrates the pedestrian existence the comforts of life on an even keel. Advice on the order of ""Look before you leap"" and ""think long term"" might be something wed appreciate hearing from a friend but as the heart and soul and essence of a romance its so lifeless its sad.

"Reiners Alex amp; Emma Not Much on the Screwball washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Reiners Alex amp; Emma Not Much on the Screwball Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Special to The Washington Post Friday June 20 2003 The generation of film fans who came of age in the 1980s can safely be divided into two demographic strata those who love Rob Reiner as the creator of the wicked rock-and-roll satire ""This Is Spinal Tap"" and those who love him for the romantic comedy ""When Harry Met Sally."" Viewers in the first group will definitely want to pass on ""Alex amp; Emma"" which turns out to be a genial if watered-down attempt to entertain the second group. Even fans of Harry and Sally may be a little bored with those characters 21st-century counterparts played here by Luke Wilson and Kate Hudson with as much good cheer as they can muster in an essentially derivative static and zing-free endeavor. Wilson plays Alex Sheldon a novelist who owes a book to his publisher and 100000 to a couple of Cuban loan sharks. ""Alex amp; Emma"" opens as Alex receives a visit from the latter gentlemen who arrange a 30-day payment schedule with the young author while one of them torches his computer a clever bit of business that means Alex will have to . . . borrow a friends computer? Hie himself to a local library? Tuck himself into a corner of his publishers office? But those would be inexcusably dreary options not to mention insurmountable obstacles to getting this particular movie off the ground. Instead Alex hires a lovely stenographer named Emma Dinsmore (Hudson). After some initial verbal sparring Emma dutifully records Alexs dulcet prose but shes smart and sassy and cant help but give him suggestions along the way and soon it becomes clear that one of the romantic protagonists at the center of Alexs novel bears more than a passing resemblance to Emma herself. The conceit of ""Alex amp; Emma"" is that as the title characters talk out Alexs novel Hudson and Wilson take on the characters in the book which is set on a posh Maine island in 1924. This not only gives the couple sumptuous locations yummy costumes and fun hairstyles to play with but also allows Hudson to strut her comic talents as an au pair who appears in Alexs book and whose nationality shifts throughout the writing process. Thus Hudson tries out various overblown accents as Ylva the naive Swedish milkmaid; Elsa a rather randy Teutonic siren; Eldora a Spanish temptress; and finally Anna a sweet down-to-earth redhead from Pennsylvania. That last persona is the most similar to Emmas own girl-next-door appeal (with her auburn hair and little makeup on Hudson resembles a younger Bebe Neuwirth) which grows on Alex as the 30-day deadline approaches. Hudson and Wilson dont generate much heat in ""Alex amp; Emma"" but their low-key playing is admittedly refreshing (their first meeting is reminiscent of the screwball comedies of the 1930s) as is the genteel 1920s setting of their imaginary story. But the dialogue in ""Alex amp; Emma"" isnt nearly sparkling enough to support such a talk-heavy movie. And Reiner borrows from Harry and Sally a bit too often especially when he gives Emma such adorable quirks as reading the last sentence of books first and compulsively removing the skins of the tomatoes on a pizza. Whats more ""Alex amp; Emma"" is a stunningly inert piece of cinema a movie that basically boils down to serial shots of people talking to each other. Much of the film takes place in Alexs Boston apartment as he narrates the book to Emma -- the effect is that of watching a Hollywood pitch without the studio perks or enormous salaries. The filmmaker John Sayles has famously said that he makes movies for free; what hes paid for is going to the meetings. Based on that calculus filmgoers who actually sit through ""Alex amp; Emma"" may be entitled to compensation. Alex amp; Emma (100 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for sexual content and some profanity.

People who manage to overlook (or perhaps simply havent seen) his shrill ""black"" comedy North his unconscionably naive Medgar Evers biopic Ghosts of Mississippi or that insufferable misogynistic divorce apologia called The Story of Us. For Reiner has persevered maintaining the image of a bankable director of ""prestige"" Hollywood product. Yet even for those of us who have never been indoctrinated into the cult of Reiner -- who find even such ""classics"" as Stand by Me A Few Good Men and The Princess Bride (a movie I never cared for even as a child) something less than the sum of their hype -- his last few movies look as though they had been made by someone else someone with matters other than movies pressing on his mind. In recent years Reiner has thrown his hat as frequently into the political ring as the cinematic one strongly backing childhood-development programs and even contemplating a California gubernatorial bid. Is it possible that the actor-turned-director who in fairness did give us This Is Spinal Tap and The Sure Thing now views his filmmaking career as little more than something to fall back on? Taking Reiners latest Alex amp; Emma as any indication the answer is yes. Though it is arguably Reiners least grotesque film of the last decade it seems the work of a director in absentia as though Reiner only periodically paid visits to the set between stops on the pre-campaign trail. Of course movies are themselves a form of politics nowadays a constant battle to remain diplomatic in the throes of impossible schedules unruly egos and that consuming quest to satisfy the demands of one demographic or another. So maybe its not that Reiner has checked out at all but that hes simply become too political -- a director ever more devoted to middle-of-the-road moviemaking-by-committee. Based very very loosely on Dostoyevskys The Gambler and the story of its creation Alex amp; Emma opens with a scene that is like a working definition of screen comedy at the end of its tether A struggling writer is dangled out of a high-rise window by two beefy Cuban gangsters one of whom is played by an actor named Chino XL and neither of whom would look out of place in a West Hollywood leather bar. The movie proceeds to be about how the writer (the Alex of the movies title played by Luke Wilson) must deliver his new novel to his publisher (Reiner himself the length of whose onscreen appearances in his own films generally seems in inverse proportion to their quality) in 30 days time so as to be able to repay the 100000 loan he owes to Chino and company. Dostoyevsky of course found himself in a similar predicament in 1866 having sunk deep into debt supporting the family of his late brother his own no-account stepson and yes having gambled away much of whatever remained. And Dostoyevsky already well into writing Crime and Punishment had contracted to complete his new novel under a one-month deadline -- not for fear of some hoods wrath but because of an agreement he had made with the books intended publisher from whom he had already borrowed a considerable sum that failure to deliver the work on time would result in the publishers ownership of all future Dostoyevsky works -- for free for the next decade. At the suggestion of a friend the author employed the services of a young stenographer Anna Grigoryevna who not only helped Dostoyevsky to complete The Gambler on time but became his wife as well. One of those great stranger-than-fiction true-life stories. In Reiners variation Grigoryevna is Emma (played by the winsome Kate Hudson) who becomes not only Alexs secretary but his muse offering spunky responses to his story ideas and assuming a role in the story itself a hodgepodge of Gambler-esque scenes intercut with the present-day action and somehow managing to include Rip Taylor and Cloris Leachman for about 30 seconds each. For Reiner and for screenwriter Jeremy Leven (who did this sort of thing much better in his 1995 directorial effort Don Juan DeMarco) the goal is a screwball throwback in which Alex and Emma start out fighting like cat and dog only to discover theyre perfect for each other just as Adam and Anna (their fictional counterparts in the novel-within-the-movie) come to the same realization. But in this would-be Dostoyevsky in Love aiming for Hepburn-Tracy rhythms but falling short even of Paltrow-Fiennes the results are more listless than lively.

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm Set almost entirely in one of those fantasy writers lofts that have been ever so carefully production-designed to look grungy-chic the movie has no visual energy; its like a three-times-too-long sitcom pilot missing the laugh track. Theres no energy in the writing either which is rather fatal for a movie about writing under the gun. Wilson (at best the second most interesting Wilson brother) and Hudson (very much endowed with mom Goldies charms but here peddling them much too hard) have a modicum of chemistry together but despite all the tony appurtenances (stories within stories romantic triangles within triangles) I never cared who ended up together or why. In the end and despite its despairing insight into the sick soul of gambling both as an addiction unto itself and as metaphor for the folly of classism The Gambler -- rushing across the page as it does like a novel running for its life -- is a far screwier farce than this movie. The Hard Words Hard man Guy Pearce. <a href=""index.php3?iyear=03amp;inumber=31amp;iimage=sm31film1.jpg""></a> Guy Pearce and Rachel Griffiths each of them reason enough to expect the unexpected returned to Australia and teamed up to make The Hard Word a nasty little heist movie that begins with a couple of screwy lively scenes of its own one in which Pearce and his team of ""associates"" stick up an armored car in something less than the blink of an eye another in which Griffiths (as Pearces wife) visiting her hubby in prison sticks two fingers between her legs and then draws a smiley face on the Plexiglas partition with the residue. (A great moment that gives new meaning to the idea of ""down under"" cinema.) Regrettably The Hard Word is all downhill from there a compendium of caper cliches and stylistic Tarantino-isms in which neither the getting nor the getting away is particularly gripping. Revolving around a plot to rob the proceeds from Australias most famous horserace the Melbourne Cup the movie is thick with double- and triple-crosses Aussie slang so indecipherable it occasionally requires English subtitling and lots of gratuitous bloodletting played for grim chuckles. Even though the premise is beyond fatigued this sort of thing can still be done well; evidence James Foleys snazzy Confidence earlier this year. But the writer-director of The Hard Word Scott Roberts paints his movie in shades of the dreariest whos-conning-who pictures like The Score and the Oceans Eleven remake and seems particularly hard-pressed to come up with any ideas that feel like his own. Shot in wide-screen the movie is slick and technically proficient but in an unexciting way. The Hard Words greatest betrayal however is of its cast of Pearce (hamming it up as the charismatic antihero) and Griffiths (as sexy as ever but more or less abandoned by the movie midway through) who give it their all but get very little in return.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr (Alex and Emma Suzanne Tenner) D+ Alex amp; Emma Genre Romance Comedy; Starring Kate Hudson Luke Wilson Sophie Marceau; Director Rob Reiner; Author Rob Reiner; Release Date Wide 06/20/2003; Runtime (in minutes) 93; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted June 27 2003 -- 1200 AM EDT If you thought that Britney Spears made a big brunet mistake a month ago just wait until you see how Kate Hudsons flat brown yuppie hair martyrs her sexiness in Alex amp; Emma. It doesnt help that shes atrociously lit but Hudson cast as a Boston stenographer looks weirdly washed-out and squishy-featured; its as if wed stumbled onto one of those old celebrity yearbook photos. ""Alex amp; Emma"" could almost be a ""Mad TV"" parody of a god-awful modern romantic comedy. The director Rob Reiner shuffles when-randy-met-prissy cliches as though he were a man struggling to play checkers long after hed forgotten the rules. Watching ""Alex amp; Emma"" were asked to buy that Luke Wilson acting like a frat-house slob whose idea of heaven is a place where ESPN gets piped into every bathroom is a successful young novelist grappling with writers block. Are you ready for the premise? Wilsons Alex owes 100000 to the Cuban Mob and unless he can dash off a novel in 30 days to retrieve his advance hell be killed. Enter Emma (Hudson) whom Alex hires so that he can dictate his manuscript a historical romance set on a ritzy island off the New England coast in 1924. Each time Alex spouts a scene we dissolve to the soggy sub? ""Masterpiece Theatre"" love quadrangle hes describing in which Adam (played by Wilson) an idealistic writer in beige linen falls for Polina (Sophie Marceau) a ruby-lipped French gold digger. Then just as abruptly were jerked back to the present day where Emma all harrumphy over the tiredness of Alexs you know male gaze cant restrain herself from editing his scenes - e.g. registering stern objection to such phrases as ""ample bosom."" Its hard to say whats more excruciating Alexs novel which is like ""The Great Gatsby"" rewritten by Lizzie McGuire or his quarrelsome flirtation with Emma who has no existence as a character apart from her drive to reshape Alex into a specimen of respectable tamed manhood. The one note of relief is Hudsons twinkly performance in the live-fiction scenes as an au pair who morphs nationalities from Swedish to German to Spanish. Speaking in accents worthy of Madeline Kahn Hudson proves a witty farceur perhaps because as a blonde shes obviously having much more fun.
