Columbia Pictures hide caption toggle caption Columbia Pictures Back in black Spider-Man gets a style makeover in summers first blockbuster but the result is less than Marvel-ous. Columbia Pictures Arent we done yet? When a superhero franchise leans as regularly as this one does on its characters emotions and back-stories maybe its predictable that by Episode Three itll become an effects-laden As the Web Turns. But at 141 minutes this supe-opera is seriously overextended with four distinct subplots and way too much hand-wringing over things like the heroines singing career. Spideys got a dark side Harrys got amnesia Mary Janes a pill Sandmans misunderstood and Venoms -- well Venoms a mess of black goo. But its hard to gin up much suspense when your supposedly vulnerable hero can get hit by a moving train and bounce off unhurt. Director Sam Raimi shoots everything but the big effects sequences in close-up presumably so the moviell look good when it gets played on cell phones in a few weeks. And he visualizes Aunt Mays observation that ""revenge is like a poison that can ... turn us into something ugly"" by turning Peter Parker into a smarmy Eurotrash version of John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever. Its a good thing the effects are state-of-the-art.

"Spider-Man 3 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; spider-man-3 ) Spider-Man 3 (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli The Spider-Man series which debuted in 2002 and continued in 2004 and 2007 represents the first superhero cycle to complete a trilogy with the same primary cast and production team it had at the beginning. If nothing else that assures viewers of a certain degree of continuity. However while it could be argued that Spider-Man 2 had too little plot for its substantial running length the opposite could be said of Spider-Man 3. Its really two movies crammed into one the first of which is a lot better than the second. Spider-Man 3 starts out strong but before it finishes many viewers will desperately wish it had called it quits an hour earlier. One has to consider that the films problems - and they are numerous - may be the product of the franchises runaway popularity. In each of the first two films director Sam Raimi was careful to limit the villain count to one (unless one counts Daily Bugle editor J. Jonah Jameson brilliantly played by J.K. Simmons). Here it triples and the focus on the bad guys limits the amount of time we have for the soap opera that is Peter Parkers life. Expectations for this movie were sky-high and one wonders whether the pressure to fulfill them caused the director to overreach his grasp and miss the point that bigger and louder do not always equate to better. When the film opens things couldnt be rosier for Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire). His alter-ego Spider-Man is a beloved icon. His girlfriend Mary-Jane (Kirsten Dunst) is making her Broadway debut. And hes getting straight As in college. The only downside is that his former best friend Harry Osborn (James Franco) continues to harbor a grudge. Harry has discovered his dads secret storage space full of bombs and body-changing chemicals and he uses those to pursue his goal of offing Spider-Man. Meanwhile Harry isnt the only bad guy Peter will have to face. Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) the con who killed Uncle Ben has escaped from prison and fled into a forbidden testing zone where radiation turns him into a creature made from living sand. And a parasitic creature from outer space called Venom has infected Spideys suit enhancing his powers and aggression any time Peter wears it. Venom eventually makes its way into the body of Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) a photographer with a grudge against Peter. The films setup is effective and feels like a continuation of the previous Spider-Man stories. The most kinetic action scene is the first one as Harry and Peter tussle through the streets of New York. Although Sandmans introduction is lame Thomas Haden Church plays the character so movingly that might have been possible to ignore this plot device if it was the only weak one in the movie (which it isnt). The most glaring stumbling block is Venom. Hes one bad guy too many. Not only is the creature poorly realized but its introduction into the story causes everything to be crowded rushed and overlong. Spider-Man 3 feels like it should end around the 140 mark but like the Energizer Bunny on a rampage it keeps going. The climactic battle is a disaster. Its not exciting and it requires two contrivances too excruciating to ignore (one involves a butler that would make Alfred look dumb; the other involves Sandmans eventual fate). Its unforgivable that the films last action scene should be so vastly inferior to the first one. The special effects arent even all that impressive. There are several instances in which its all-too-obvious that Spider-Man and his nemeses are computer generated. This is sloppier than anything in either Spider-Man or Spider-Man 2. To a large extent the movie seems like a regurgitation of motifs and ideas from its predecessors. The Mary Jane/Peter/Harry love triangle is back and it spends much of the movie spinning its wheels (although I will admit that the scene on the bridge is heartbreaking). Peter once again must battle his inner demons and bemoan how he handled Uncle Bens death. Mary Jane gets to bait the hook for a third time and ends up re-playing the damsel in distress role. The fight scenes feel like they take a little from the first movie a little from the second and mix them together. Theyre more formulaic than exhilarating and theres nothing in Spider-Man 3 that comes close to the train sequence from Spider-Man 2. There are also unnecessary characters. I guess Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard) has been added as a nod to comic book fans but she serves no purpose other than to make us wonder whether Mary Jane is still an interesting character. Her father (James Cromwell) is equally underused. Bruce Campbell gets a nice extended cameo but why do his scenes seem like Monty Python outtakes? And as I have already mentioned everything about Venom is a mistake. At the very least this villain deserved its own movie rather than being awkwardly shoehorned into a film that starts out being about Peter Harry and Sandman. Audience reaction to the film at the midnight opening screening was negative bordering on hostile meaning that the core group of fans did not like what they were seeing. Its easy to understand their displeasure. Compared to the other two movies in the series this one is a misfire. Its for completists only and even they are likely to feel let down. Spider-Man and the first sequel were breezy adventures - easy and fun to sit through. Spider-Man 3 is a chore. The effective moments require a lot patience to uncover and some of what has to be shifted to get to them is not worth the effort. People love trilogies because its said that good things come in threes but this series would have looked better and felt more satisfying had the filmmakers stopped at two.

The loosely woven plot of ""Spider-Man 3"" has more flyaway strands than Donald Trumps comb- over. With at least six major subplots tied randomly into a cloying patternless weave the most anticipated movie of the hot season quickly loses our interest. And I say this as a huge fan of the ""Spider"" ancestors 1 and 2 which presented coherent stories based on beloved characters bound seamlessly into vivid popcorn plots. ""Spider- Man 3"" feels threadbare - a leftover - prompting us by sheer repetition to grow irritated with the same characters we previously adored Naive Peter Needy M.J. Sainted Aunt May Deathless Friend Harry. Director Sam Raimi seems stuck. We revisit troubled storylines that were cliches in ""Spider-Man 2."" We see Uncle Bens pivotal death scene - again hashed over - another four or five times. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) still arent married and 145 minutes later are no closer to picking a china pattern. Friend Harry soldiers on despite being apparently killed three or four times ... see? Even Im repeating myself. This was meant to be Spider-Mans ""dark"" movie. You know superhero pressures build chicks dig the Tef- lon-coated Lycra fame and fortune extend their beguiling webs. The power bug bites Spidey and his very suit turns black. Will blank cheerful Tobey acquire a believable snarl? Raimi and screenwriters Ivan Raimi and Alvin Sargent never decide whether to filter this intrigue through evil or humor. They go for both to the detriment of each. As Bad Peter Parker Maguire is sent on a geeky strut through the streets of Manhattan like a John Travolta fresh from his shift at Radio Shack instead of a paint store. He humiliates M.J. in a jazz-club sequence less reminiscent of Errol Flynn than of Will Ferrell bo-garting the jazz flute in ""Anchorman."" Even the fight scenes are nauseating but unremarkable for all their expense. (Hollywood word has it that ""Spider-Man 3"" is the most expensive movie ever made at between 270 million and 350 million - not counting another 100 million in marketing.) This third go-round feels self-indulgent in length pacing inside jokes and family casting (Raimis everywhere including little Raimi children in rough cameos and clunky comic sequences.) ""Spider-Man 3s"" opening credits are promising - within the stirring confines of the trademark Danny Elfman score we get a quick visual summary of the first two movies their monsters and heroes. Now to part III Peter wants to propose to M.J. but lacks money and courage. M.J. wants to start her Broadway career but lacks confidence and talent. Former Friend Harry (James Franco) wants revenge against Spider-Man but lacks enthusiasm and skill. A black ooze lands near Peter Parker in an errant meteor and wants to possess Spider-Mans soul but lacks proper backstory or screen time. Theres also a Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) created from an escaped convict. (Must they insist on locating Supermax prisons next door to experimental particle accelerators with low fences?) Harry gets amnesia. Topher Grace plays a new Daily Bugle photographer. Editor Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons) has high blood pressure. Idle Aunt May could really use a book club or a casino cruise or something. And that engagement ring gets more screen time and subplots than most of last years best supporting actress nominees. All in all the fun has simply gone out of it. Spidey has long since taken Manhattan and now he doesnt know what the heck to do with it. Maguire risks losing himself to Spider-Man altogether whether the good one the bad one or simply the dull one. Dunst should gamble her luminous face on more challenges like ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" and ""Marie Antoinette."" Raimi should exit the franchise before he blows the budgets of 10 worthier movies. Everyone in short should move on. Shows over. Theres nothing to see here folks. Perhaps no two spider webs are alike but its getting harder and harder to tell the difference.

Its partly the sheer length partly the well-paced but notably episodic plot but mostly because it offers the culmination of the cohesive narrative of honesty and betrayal to oneself and ones loved ones that has underscored the whole franchise. Its an impressive achievement balancing petty psychological foibles against citywide peril just as the CG mise en scene roves from the molecular to the multi-storey.We open with Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and his girl Mary-Jane (Kirsten Dunst) in the pink though this of course cant last. Their schoolfriend Harry (James Franco) embittered son of the first films Green Goblin is nursing Hamlet-lite revenge fantasies against our hero who must also contend with the Dracula-Frankenstein combo of Venom - a black glob of parasitic alien symbiote that brings out its hosts dark side - and Sandman the shape-shifting result of fugitive Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) being scientifically melded with er sand. Needless to say this all plays havoc with everyones private life.These films greatest pleasure is their gleefully swooping exploitation of Manhattans vertiginous topography - its a good job Spidey wasnt hatched in say Holland - and this one doesnt disappoint. Dog-fights amid skyscrapers in the bowels of the subway and most effectively in a tight alleyway all exhilarate; impressively a bare-knuckle punch-up behind closed doors packs as much wallop. Despite such action some fine comic relief (Bruce Campbell as a French maitre d) and a few cheesy moments the tone is ultimately more subdued than your average superhero movie. Kudos to Raimi for making it feel justified.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor May 4 2007 Save for later Saved Reviewing franchise movies is a bit like reviewing an ad campaign. The studio mind-set and promotional tie-ins are as integral to the discussion as the film itself. In a sense they are one and the same.With ""Spider-Man 3"" the studios mission is clear Sony wants to keep this tent pole upright for as long as possible - maybe until Tobey Maguire qualifies for the AARP.I thought the first Spider-Man movie was OK and the second much better. The new one however is a let-down - too much going on with too little to show for it. Director Sam Raimi and his team will do anything to hold the audiences attention even if it means clogging the landscape with so many bad guys that the movie develops villain gridlock. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Spidey gets lost in the shuffle. To some extent he always has. Especially as played by Maguire Spider-Man has to be one of the most recessive superheroes in movie history. I realize that his ordinary-guy routine is integral to his appeal but a little of this meekness stuff goes a long way with me. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 In ""Spider-Man 3"" we are brought into Spideys ""dark side"" - which turns out to be grayish. It all begins with a gloppy substance that crashes to the earth and affixes itself to Spider-Mans suit turning it black and enhancing his powers. Also his ego. He spiffs up his hairstyle and struts the city streets while women gasp.Given what a dweeb Peter Parker - Spideys Clark Kent-like self - is I initially welcomed the Nutty Professor-style transformation. But it turns out that a little of this goes a long way too. Maguire isnt really a different actor playing the ""dark"" Spider-Man - he just has a different haircut.Much more of a drag this time around is Kirsten Dunsts Mary Jane whose Broadway career takes a nose-dive along with her love life. With Peter gallivanting about much of the time she has little to do except fume and act bereft.So who does that leave to look at? For me it was pretty much all Sandman - the best of the villains by far. It was a brilliant move to cast Thomas Hayden Church the somnolent jock from ""Sideways"" as escaped con Flint Marko. Churchs morose doggedness works perfectly here. Even before Marko morphs into the shape-shifting Man of Earth his movements have a slurry slowness - hes a human sandbag.The other bad guys are visually less interesting. Topher Grace plays a rival for Peters job as photographer at the Daily Bugle who is transformed into Venom - a megaversion of Spider-Man. Their aerial fight scenes are well done - all the aerial special effects in the film are - but overlong.Harry Osborn (James Franco) out to avenge his father the Green Goblin also signs on as a villain. Sporting the latest in trendy Goblin-wear he zooms into the stratosphere to battle his nemesis. Lots of midair clanging ensues.""Spider-Man 3"" is far from a flop and Im sure the Spider-maniacs will eat it up. For me its a buffet without much aftertaste. Grade B- Rated PG-13 for sequences of intense action violence.

"Spidey Runs Out of Webbing washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Spidey Runs Out of Webbing Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday May 4 2007 Must we always kill the thing we love? In an apparent effort to put a stake in the heart of the franchise that threatens to swallow his career whole ""Spider-Man"" series director Sam Raimi has delivered an overlong visually incoherent mean-spirited and often just plain awful ""Spider-Man 3"" a tangled web of special-effects overkill and self-indulgence that all but destroys the fun and goodwill created by the first two movies. If this first of the blockbuster ""three-quels"" is any indication its going to be a lumbar-challenging summer. And when viewers consider that at nearly 2 1/2 hours ""Spider-Man 3"" is 30 minutes shorter than the upcoming ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movie they might want to cancel the paper hold their mail and simply move to the multiplex for the duration. (Fans with memories of ""Batman Forever"" ""X-Men The Last Stand"" and ""Blade Trinity"" might also conclude that the number three is to comic-book franchises what 13th floors are to hotels.) Tobey Maguire Kirsten Dunst and James Franco reunite in the third installment of the Spidey story which is still dominated by father figures sexual competition and revenge. Peter Parker (Maguire) now a New York hero as Spider-Man is ready to pop the question to Mary Jane (Dunst) whose Broadway career -- singing a painful rendition of Irving Berlins ""They Say Its Wonderful"" -- is off to an un-wonderful start. Meanwhile Peters erstwhile best friend Harry (Franco) is still convinced that Peter killed his dad played by Willem Dafoe way back in ""Spider-Man"" circa 2002. Peter viewers will remember also suffered his own primal loss in that first installment when his beloved Uncle Ben was brutally murdered. That event comes back to haunt Peter in the form of Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) an escaped convict with bulging biceps a mournful visage and a score to settle. (A blondified Topher Grace plays another new character a cub photographer named Eddie but he doesnt make nearly the same impact.) Whereas the first two terrific ""Spider-Man"" movies stayed true to the original comic books dark psychological materials without sacrificing an overall tone of lightness and wholesome fun ""Spider-Man 3"" is a curiously joyless enterprise with Peter becoming infected with a weird supernatural substance that allows his native fatheadedness to metastasize into full-blown jerkdom. It all starts when a dollop of black alien glue attaches itself to his scooter and follows him home one night; soon a thoroughly unpleasant alter ego emerges propelling Peter to assume the haircut and eyeliner of an old Joy Division cover band and sashay down Manhattan streets with an awkward cock-of-the-walk strut. Maguire who recently proved he can play a rat in Steven Soderberghs ""The Good German"" doesnt pull off the physical bits of business Raimi asks of him here whether in that weirdly off-key sequence or an even stranger musical number in which he dances like a reject from a Bob Fosse bus-and-truck audition. Raimi has always been a conscientious shepherd of the characters who populate the ""Spider-Man"" series giving them their depth and narrative due. Here he seems to have it out for both Peter and M.J. who never quite manages to overcome her pathetic story line. From that tuneless opening number things never get much better for poor M.J.; even when Peter realizes what an egomaniac hes been things end on a decidedly minor key. (Indeed the entire movie doesnt conclude so much as deflate in large part because Raimis idea of wrapping things up is for a butler to suddenly appear with a confession best described as Tenetesque in its now-you-tell-us timing.) ""Spider-Man 3"" has been reported as the most expensive movie ever made at an estimated 350 million most of that money going toward computerized visual effects. Even with countless effects-driven set pieces -- including an early showdown with Harry as New Goblin (decked out as a Space Age skate punk whizzing around like the Silver Surfer from the new ""Fantastic Four"") a terrifying stunt with a crane run amok and several encounters with two new villains Sandman and Venom -- there are no truly memorable stunts with Raimi filming everything in jittery close-up with head-spinning edits and slice-and-dice sound effects. ""Spider-Man 3"" may eventually look good on an iPod but on the big screen its a blobby illegible mess. Theres one exception when a character falls into a particle physics lab (particle physics labs being as common as sidewalk cracks in Spidey-world) and is blown into more pieces than James Frey. When hes reconstituted as Sandman the effect is truly stunning with each granule swirling together at the hands of an invisible sculptor. Not only is that visual creation myth itself a terrific piece of artistry but Church as the Sandmans human alter ego turns out to be unusually well-suited for such a larger-than-life tale. With his preternaturally muscular build and deeply etched sorrowful features hes the one person in ""Spider-Man 3"" who already looks as though he could have been drawn at a drafting table yet is still recognizably human. Spider-Man 3 (140 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for intense action violence.

Spider-Man in his new dark bodysuit Its odd to think of Spider-Man 2 as a small movie but next to the clanking wheezing contraption that is Spider-Man 3 that 784 million-grossing megahit feels like some little Sundance indie. In an attempt to break opening-weekend records and justify this movies much-disputed price tag director Sam Raimi has piled on so many villains subplots supporting roles and production numbers (Kirsten Dunst sings Tobey Maguire dances) that a news anchor is brought in at one point to help distinguish between two separate black-Lycra-clad superdudes who are terrorizing the city at the same time. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The second Spider-Man one of those rare franchise sequels that surpasses the original cleverly kept things simple Peter Parker (Maguire) the superheros schleppy alter ego had to decide whether saving the world was worth losing his beloved Mary Jane Watson (Dunst) while Mary Jane had to decide between sticking with Peter and marrying a square-jawed astronaut. Spidey 2 also had a knockout villain in Doc Ock a man-machine-octopus hybrid played with Byronic gloom by Alfred Molina. Advertisement The writers of Spider-Man 3 a team that includes Raimi and his brother Ivan (but not novelist Michael Chabon who collaborated on the script of 2) seem to be suffering from villain insecurity. Are they afraid that James Franco as Peters best-friend-turned-superfoe Harry Osborn isnt threatening enough? Why do they feel the need to overcompensate by throwing in the Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) an ex-con who can change into a shape-shifting heap of sand particles and Venom (Topher Grace) an envious rival of Peters at the Daily Bugle who transforms into a fanged building-scaling meanie? And Im not even counting Bad Spider-Man or the evil space licorice. Yes licorice. In a development entirely unrelated to any of the abovementioned bad guys a meteor harboring an evil symbiotic life form just happens to land near the spot where Peter and MJ are lounging on a giant spiderweb looking at the stars. (Yet another perk of dating a superhero He can weave you a rad hammock) A bit of this space fungus which looks like a living bundle of black licorice whips just happens to wrap itself around Petes scooter. The candy rides back to his squalid apartment where it hangs out under the furniture till its time to wrap itself slowly inexorably around his Spidey suit. Overnight Spider-Man gets a black-clad evil twin while the modest nerdy Peter metamorphoses into a conceited spotlight-hogging ladies man--basically a superdick. Peters narcissistic self-enjoyment during the early phase of this transformation is one of the funnest parts of the movie. Tobey Maguire struts the streets of New York like John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever giving finger guns to every attractive woman he sees. He heads into a clearance sale and comes out looking fine in a suave black suit. He performs a weird Bob Fosse jazz-hands evil dance with his new love interest Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard) while Mary Jane looks on crushed. These utterly silly scenes add little to the movies multiple story lines and this film at 140 minutes is plenty well-padded without them. But they do return us briefly to the spirit of Spider-Man the endearing fact that as Dan Kois points out in his slide show on the character this is a superhero for the rest of us. Hes broke a bad dresser clumsy at romantic gestures and perpetually late. The evil Peter Parker is funny because hes nowhere near as frightening as he thinks he is--a gambit that in a defter movie could have been played not only for laughs but for drama. The script hints that Peters jerkification was already under way before his encounter with the corrupting space candy. Why not go with that internal motivation for the transformation? Scrap the Black Vines of Doom and this becomes a fable about how success makes monsters of us all (a story that Raimi helming one of the top-grossing franchises in movie history no doubt knows something about.) Of course the critics could condemn Spider-Man 3 in one thundering chorus and wed sound like a few sorry crickets chirping to the hordes who will line up to see it this weekend. There are plenty of pleasures here The slow birth of the Sandman from a heap of supercharged sand crystals (or something) is a marvel of digital animation and the chemistry between Dunst and Maguire feels like the dynamic of a real couple full of subtle shifts and eloquent silences. But the climactic action sequence with its surfeit of villains and its final weepy sacrifice seems hastily assembled from a bargain rack of lesser movies. Your first thought as the credits roll isnt ""Wow whatll happen next?"" but ""Where is there left to go with this?""

Starring Tobey Maguire Kirsten Dunst and James Franco. Directed by Sam Raimi. (PG-13. 140 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) If the first ""Spider-Man"" had a script as weak and muddled as the one for ""Spider-Man 3"" its hard to believe it ever would have been made. But with the series a worldwide success -- and especially coming off ""Spider-Man 2"" which was superb -- the filmmakers can afford a weak entry without having to worry about being punished. The only ones wholl be punished are audiences. ""Spider-Man 2"" was a textbook example of how to make a sequel Deepen it make it funnier give it more heart and come up with a strong villain and a good story. ""Spider Man 3"" by contrast shows how not to make a sequel. The film takes three bad stories and tries to fashion a narrative out of them. It cant be done. It also takes established and warmly regarded characters and has them behave in ways that make no sense in terms of what we know about them. And perhaps to give the movie the illusion of scale it contains many empty conversations -- scenes in which characters dither and nothing happens. Word to the wise Whenever Rosemary Harris shows up as Peter Parkers beloved old aunt its safe to run out and get popcorn. Even the special effects take a step backward. Body movements are awkward. The elastic springing of Spider-Man as he vaults and swings from the tops of buildings looks unnatural too often like something on a computer screen. The effect isnt helped by director Sam Raimis choice to film a lot of the hand-to-hand combat in close-ups in quick cuts which sometimes makes it difficult to track whats going on. Little imprecisions in the effects wouldnt matter if the other aspects of the film were working. But ""Spider-Man 3"" screws up even some of the more reliable elements most notably the relationship between Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and his girlfriend Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). Things start well. Mary Jane has a singing part in a Broadway show and Peter goes to see her. The reviews are awful and thats a potentially interesting and satisfying direction Dunst who does her own singing really does sound amateurish. But the movie doesnt build from that in a coherent way. The script hints that maybe being Spider-Man is going to Peter Parkers head but it doesnt commit to that course. It suggests that maybe Mary Jane is becoming jealous of Peters success but it doesnt follow through on that either. It just keeps feinting in various directions and in the process it distorts Peter and Mary Janes relationship. At times the plotting is so flimsy that it rolls out the oldest and least forgivable trick in the book It depends on Peter and Mary Janes not talking when they most certainly would not telling each other things they definitely would say. Thats just cheap and it betrays these characters whove been lovingly built over the course of two features. Three stories are set in motion in the movies first minutes (1) Harry Osborn (James Franco) Peters old friend decides to follow in his Goblin fathers footsteps and becomes Spider-Mans nemesis; (2) The criminal (Thomas Haden Church) who killed Peters saintly uncle (Cliff Robertson) is transformed through a process of disintegration and reintegration into an unkillable Sandman; and (3) An alien substance -- black and elastic -- comes to earth in a meteorite and finds its way to Peters apartment. Its all marginally interesting but theres one thing missing a real villain. Harry Osborn is a confused young man not the essence of evil and Sandman though a destructive force is as mournful as Lon Chaney Jr.s Wolfman. Hes not a driven adversary. Hes more like a sad mope. The most promising plot element is the black elastic substance which attaches itself to the body as a second skin and emphasizes whatever latent dark traits its wearer might have. But Raimi and his associates let that element lie dormant for almost half the movies running time when a good story might have been fashioned from that concept alone. Epics are made from stories that demand the epic treatment. A story has a certain scale and grandeur and the act of doing justice to it results in an epic. Thats the right way to do it. The wrong way is to decide you want to make a big movie and then without much to say you proceed to throw every possible idea at the screen in the hope itll work out. Thats what Raimi does in ""Spider-Man 3"" which is so clumsy that at times one can sense the filmmaker artificially slowing down one story in order to pursue another. Maguire and Dunst are appealing as always even though theyd be better off with stronger material. Actually the whole world of the ""Spider-Man"" films is appealing which is what saves this entry from disaster. At 140 minutes its not a difficult movie to sit through. Its just difficult to enjoy. -- Advisory Intense action violence.

Related Spidey bad guys dish on fine art of villiany ""Spider-Man"" scenes and characters Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""Spider-Man 3"" with Tobey Maguire Kirsten Dunst James Franco Thomas Haden Church Topher Grace Bryce Dallas Howard Rosemary Harris J.K. Simmons James Cromwell. Directed by Sam Raimi from a screenplay by Sam Raimi Ivan Raimi and Alvin Sargent based on the Marvel Comics books by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko. 134 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sequences of intense action violence. Opens at midnight tonight. Opens in IMAX Friday at Pacific Science Center. ""Where do all these guys come from?"" muses Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) pouring sand from his Spidey sneakers after an encounter with the franchises newest villain Sandman (Thomas Haden Church). ""Spider-Man 3"" the latest stellar installment in Sam Raimis superhero series gives us an impressive lineup of baddies; more youd think than one skinny webslinger -- or one movie -- could handle. But Raimi hurtles us breathlessly through the many subplots like were swinging on one of Spider-Mans threads. The result is sheer fun at the movies the ooh-look-at-that pass-the-popcorn kind of fun thats become increasingly rare -- except in this franchise. We know the main characters well by now whether we grew up with the Stan Lee/Steve Ditko Marvel Comics books or just fell in love with Raimis two previous installments and well follow them anywhere. Theres something immensely appealing about Peter Parker (Spider-Mans regular-guy alter ego) and Maguire plays him like the good guy in an old-time Hollywood melodrama. With his hair carefully parted and his voice chirping dweebily hes all innocent charm and he looks at Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) the girl he loves like shes his pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. ""You are such a nerd"" she says to him affectionately early in the film. A redheaded damsel in distress (you know that at some point in these movies Mary Janes going to be dangling from something) shes now catching the eye of old pal Harry Osborn. Played by James Franco (whos as handsome as any silver-screen star) hes a still-life-painting rich boy with a secret identity -- and a secret revenge agenda -- of his own. Add to the mix Sandman an escaped con transformed by a visit to a particle physics testing facility -- hes now for reasons that only a physicist or comic-book writer could explain able to shape-shift at will transforming himself into grains of sand. Church who has a nice touch with vulnerable big guys (as he showed in ""Sideways"") makes him a tragic figure; a deft contrast with Venom (Topher Grace) an oily villain who revels in his own evilness. His human persona is Eddie Brock a glib photographer for the Daily Bugle whos eyeing Peters position. Grace a breezy comic actor attacks the role like its a ham sandwich. Hes having a blast and so are we. And the populations larger still. Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard) a pretty classmate of Peters turns up to run some blond interference between Mary Jane and Peter. Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) is back with more homespun wisdom grounding Peter in a more humble world. Meanwhile J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons) is still presiding over the Daily Bugle cantankerously coping with high blood pressure and with the general headache that Spider-Man gives him. ""Hes a fake Hes full of stickum"" Jameson yells at whomever will listen. (The wonderfully wound-up Simmons who bellows all his lines as if the rest of the cast is across the street is one of this franchises treasures; you wish he were on screen more.) The three separate (sometimes intersecting) villain storylines make for plenty of high-flying duels each breathtaking -- I particularly liked a moment when Spider-Man zipped nimbly between the grid of a construction crane high above Manhattan. And the main arc of the plot in which Spider-Mans suit turns black and his personality takes a darker turn gives Maguire a rare and unexpected chance for comedy. As the newer more caddish Peter Parker (hes wearing the dark Spidey suit under his clothes) he struts the streets with confidence. Flipping up the collar of his jacket hes grooving to some mysterious Bob Fosse-ish beat (hes almost got jazz hands). The new Peter thinks hes pretty fabulous but the gazes from random women on the street say otherwise. Superhero movies can often fall into the trap of being overly solemn and reverent; ""Spider-Man 3"" delightfully avoids this peril. For every funny scene though theres a moment of beautifully acted drama or a tiny character piece from an actor who well barely see again. (Mageina Tovah as a landlords slouchy daughter quietly enthralled by Peter gives us everything we need to know about her character in just a few moments.) Its not quite as perfect as ""Spider-Man 2"" though and the problem is mostly in the character of Mary Jane whos now struggling to become a Broadway star. Dunst is charming as ever but the choice to have her warble a few songs (just barely passably) seems misguided and the screenwriters havent found much for her to do otherwise. (An oddly detailed scene in which she makes omelets with Harry in his kitchen stops the movie dead just for a few minutes.) But thats a small flaw in an otherwise terrific film which should deservedly pack the multiplexes well into the summer. Will this be the end of ""Spider-Man"" on screen? Surely not; the studio isnt likely to give up on a franchise this profitable whether or not Raimi or Maguire chooses to return. (Its hard to imagine the ""Spider-Man"" movies without either of them. We all saw the ""X-Men"" franchise take a dip in quality when original director Bryan Singer left after two films. And Maguire has made Peter/Spidey all his own; the supporting characters are marvelous but its his brave soulful work that pulls it all together.)

Related Is Spider-Man Worth 300 Million? Email Print Share Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Del.i.cious Google+ Reprints Follow TIME The movie audience has been on a post-Lenten fast lately. Last weekends total take at the domestic box office was only 77.7 million -- a most unlucky number for the studios dumping their clearance-sale titles on an apathetic market. For filmgoers this was the purge before the binge. A heady month is ahead with Shrek the Third and Pirates of the Caribbean At Worlds End ready to pick the publics pockets. And this weekend Spider-Man 3 which on its own is guaranteed to top last weekends cume. Anything under a 100 million launch would be disappointing for a threequel with a budget in at least the quarter-billion-dollar range. These days directors of special-effects epics can spend money faster than Tony Soprano at the roulette table. Tony in moments of crisis has an anxiety attack or orders someones death. In Spider-Man 3 Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) the young-adult nerd with preternatural powers gets covered in intergalactic black stickum. Once hes gooed hes bad -- bad for him anyway which is still better than most of us on our best behavior. He spends much of the movie trying to resist the temptation of outlawry the nefarious fashion of basic black. This plot device has tested the credulity of some early viewers of Spider-Man 3 as I gleaned from snippets of Jon Stewarts chat with Maguire on Tuesdays Daily Show. ""Heres what I buy"" Stewart said teasingly. ""A supergenetic spider bites you on the hand and you yourself take on some of the characteristics of a spider. [But now] apparently something falls from outer space and it turns into a black suit. And that for me is where the Spider-Man series y know loses its believability."" Plausibility isnt the biggest challenge for the comic-book-movie fan base. Sentimentality is. An Aint It Cool News review supposedly written by the mother of a friend of AICN critic Moriarty tosses Spidey 3 into the sar-chasm by informing us that ""Theres only about 25 minutes of actual Spidey footage in this movie -- which makes all kinds of room for That darling Mary Jane singing (two songs). Peter Parker crying. Harry [Osborn] crying.... The Sandman crying. Eddie Brock crying. Mary Jane crying. Aunt May crying.... And yes I might as well tell you there ARE a few action scenes that get in the way of all the interesting stuff between the characters and their relationships and their ordinary everyday lives."" No question this is one wet action movie. It sets a worlds record for so-called tough guys shedding tears. Harry Osborn (James Franco) gets weepie over his fathers death and enraged at his belief that Peter was responsible for it; he vents his rage in the supervillain guise of the New Goblin. Before being transformed into the irradiated Sandman Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) the recidivist hoodlum -- and murderer of Peters sainted uncle -- goes all soft and moist as he clutches his young daughters locket. Peter has a jewelry fetish too his aunt has given him her wedding ring which he plans to present to his girlfriend Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst). But our hero has more urgent concerns. His protracted adolescent funk has given way to an anxiety crisis from which his ability to soar over the city saving lives cannot extricate him.

"Spider-Man 3 Spin out | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesSpider-Man 3 Spin outThe dew is definitely off the web in the third instalment of the Spider-Man cinema saga five years after it first wowed weary eyes.Everyones favourite hero returns to the big screen in Spider-Man 3 on May 4.  (COURTESY COLUMBIA PICTURES)  Spider-Man examines his dark side in his third movie outing which spends too much time mired in recycled subplots.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. May 3 2007Spider-Man 3 (out of four) Starring Tobey Maguire Kirsten Dunst James Franco Thomas Haden Church Topher Grace Rosemary Harris and J.K. Simmons. Directed by Sam Raimi. 140 minutes. At major theatres. PG Spidey still swings in Spider-Man 3 but man does the story dangle. Our wall-crawling urban warrior doesnt know which direction to spin. If hes not fighting icky alien gunk that turns him funky hes wrestling with a grieving goblin a fanged photog and a real son of a beach. Even with a leisurely running time of 2 hours and 20 minutes this first blockbuster of summer 07 has at least two bad guys too many. And whats with all the crying? Both heroes and villains shed tears so readily you almost want to stand up mid-screening and ask director Sam Raimi to stop the projector so everybody can have a group hug. Did someone forget that Spider-Man is supposed to have funny moments too? Meanwhile girlfriend Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) has become both bore and trollop. Unable to fully connect with either Spider-Man or his nerdy alter-ego Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire times two) and miffed that her stage musical career is bombing (with good reason) she turns as faithful as a fruit fly. Not that Peter is much better since he falls under the spell of blond hussy Gwen (Bryce Dallas Howard) the daughter of the police captain (James Cromwell). The dew is definitely off the web in this third instalment of the Spider-Man cinema saga five years after it first wowed weary eyes. Battle fatigue has set in as so often happens when franchises hit a triple. The writing credited to Raimi his brother Ivan and Spider-Man 2 co-scripter Alvin Sargent seems drained of ideas relying on recycled subplots from original Marvel Comics episodes. In the realm of movie thrill makers Sam Raimi always seemed like the smartest guy in the room. Now he just seems like the guy with the biggest budget - a near-record 250 million (U.S.) There are times when you wonder what he spent the money on. Yet for all that Spider-Man remains the best of the comic book movie adaptations. Enough energy and spirit remain to warrant a recommendation although its one larded with reservations. The action scenes still thrill but there arent enough of them. The hook with this latest instalment is that Spidey turns bad switching to a jet-black suit that is definitely a sartorial upgrade even if it messes with his mind. Hes the victim of alien slime that literally falls out of the sky and which acts like a fashion consultant with a bad attitude. It turns our hero turn into a pimp-strutting and bitch-slapping rouser who comes perilously close to a Ron Burgundy parody. When hes not in his snazzy Spider duds Parker dons a black suit matched with a shaggy hairdo that makes him look like a member of Spandau Ballet or an Emo kid depending on your age and perspective. It takes a full hour for Spidey to turn to the proverbial dark side and its just one of many strands in this very tangled web. ""Ive come a long way from the boy who was bitten by a spider"" Parker brags to himself. ""Now people really like me."" His therapist may buy that but whos zooming who? Support for Spidey in his New York domain remains shaky at best. Especially since Daily Bugle editor J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons) is still bent on portraying him as a thug in tights a mission also taken up by photo hotshot Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) who wants a Bugle job badly enough to blow taps for Spidey. Brock cuts in on the Spidey-snapping turf previously owned by meek Bugle boy Peter Parker who requires a backbone transplant more than ever. And while Parker is sorting things out at home and at work all hell is breaking loose in the concrete canyons. His erstwhile buddy Harry Osborn (James Franco) still his romantic rival for Mary Jane has gone as nutso as the late Osborn Sr. Hes morphed into a reborn Green Goblin more dangerous than ever. An early aerial confrontation between the New Goblin (or Goblin Jr. as Bad Spidey mocks) is one of the highlights of Spider-Man 3. Then theres small-time con Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) who has a big connection to Parker that is revealed in an eyebrow-rolling flashback. On the lam from the cops he falls into a vat of souped-up sand that turns him into a genuine dirt bag and a maudlin one at that. Hes now the shape-shifting Sandman but hes all busted up over his nasty habit of firing guns at the people hes robbing. ""Im not a bad person"" he wails. ""I just had bad luck."" Tell it to the judge bub. Or maybe wail to Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) who has become a tedious scold. Like a distaff Yoda she warns about the dangers of giving into feelings of anger and revenge hard things to suppress when psycho mutants are chasing you. Ambulance chaser Eddie Brock turns into fanged foe Venom who is looking to get even with Spider-Man because - get this - he blames the web-slinger for an act of plagiarism that cost him his job. Its not exactly the kind of motivation of which gripping drama is made but Spideys other adversaries arent much better. Goblin Jr. wants to avenge his dead pa Sandman wants to prove hes not bad by killing people and the black alien gunk seems to want a job dressing Goth supermodels. Nobody expects great acting in movie like this but the franchise has previously been a cut above its comic origins. The same cant be said of Spider-Man 3 which manages to make both Maguire and Dunst seem wooden wimpy and whiny. What snuffed the spark between these two? The films many complications make you nostalgic for the villains of Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2 the original Green Goblin and Doc Octopus who had much simpler yet grander plans. Whatever happened to wanting to take over the world or at least New York City? None of the super creeps here can even muster a truly evil laugh although Topher gives it a go God bless him. But there I go looking for trouble when all anybody really wants is a nice big hug.

Columbia Pictures Spider-Man 3 perfect for geeks too long for others 1 / 2 Back to Gallery How much of a geek are you? All those who confess to Spider-Man fanaticism raise your right hand. Now bend the two middle fingers toward your palm flick your wrist outward and shoot flying-arachnid goop on any available skyscraper. Swing to the roof of the nearest multiplex. If you are ill-equipped for such a maneuver do not attempt it. More pedestrian approaches to Spider-Man 3 will get you there too although nongeeks should enter with care. Movie goers not absorbed by the spring-wound Spidey mythos might find the running time exhausting the subplots excessive and the mood shifts bizarre but hard-core fans should be giddy little web-slingers. And thats not even counting the Bruce Campbell cameo. The third Spider-Man like the first two was directed by genre king Sam Raimi and stars the charismatically ordinary Tobey Maguire as a young man with a radioactive spider bite. The joy of the first film was one of discovery -- look a comic-book hero can be a nasally dork and still kick butt -- while the joy of the second lay in its rich character byplay and oddball comic riffs. The oddball element remains in Spider-Man 3 but the script is busy with so many supporting characters and plot detours that the series charming idiosyncrasy is sometimes lost in the noise. Fortunately its entertaining noise switching in timbre from giddy innocence to swivel-hipped ironic cockiness to fanged vengeance and back again often in the space of a few tidy scenes. The name of the game is sudden turnabout character change Good guys go bad bad guys go good and M.J. nearly goes off the deep end with frustration. Youll recall M.J. as Spider-Mans main squeeze ably rendered by the melancholic Kirsten Dunst. As the movie begins shes starring on Broadway and crazy in love with Spideys quotidian alter ego Peter Parker. He plans to pop the question but there are hitches including a venomous rival photographer (Topher Grace bleached hair signaling dubious moral rectitude) an escaped convict turned Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) and a still-ticked-off Harry Osborn (James Franco back for thirds) seeking to avenge the death of his pa the Green Goblin. Peter also has to cope with his own inflated head ""People really like me"" he crows in a Sally Field moment of bubbleheaded swagger. But his main problem is a cosmic black ooze that binds to his cellular structure knits him a black Bad-Spidey costume and makes him an angry angry boy. It also makes him look like the bassist for an emo band Is that Pete Wentz behind the bangs? Spider-Mans trip to the dark side is played half for laughs half for the benefit of free-will philosophizing (""We always have a choice"") that cuts to the heart of every comic book. Spider-Man 3 is funny here and touching there but its also relentlessly violent -- and utterly inappropriate for small children. The action bits are cartoonish and unrealistic yes but watching a mans head get ground to dust on the side of a speeding subway car is not the stuff of nursery rhymes. Other sequences are magically imaginative especially Churchs sculpted transmutation -- thank you particle physics lab -- from brokenhearted convict into monstrous Sandman. Fans love ranking franchise installments (Empire then Star Wars then Jedi) so Ill save them some work Spider-Man 2 is the best of the lot then Spider-Man 3 then Spider-Man 1. Feel differently?

The kids sailing through college. His girlfriend cant stop goo-goo-eyeing him - and shes not only beautiful shes making her Broadway singing debut. And after a rocky start the town he lives in - New York - has come to welcome Parkers web-slinging crime-fighting alter ego. A headline from one of the tabs ""Why NY Spidey."" At least thats how things are in the opening minutes of Spider-Man 3 before an asteroid deposits evil black goop on Parkers motor scooter; before an escaped convict walks into a particle-physics gizmo; before a hotshot photographer tries to muscle in on Parkers newspaper job; before a rich kid with a mind for revenge starts hover-boarding around town lobbing IEDs; before a beautiful blond coed falls from 62 stories and Spidey catches her and before Spideys girl gets jealous. Its a messy business. And it gets messier as Parker also known as Spider-Man wrestles with villainy romance his own exploding ego and the burden of coming up with something to satisfy the millions of fans of Installments 1 and 2. Its a mighty burden and one that Spider-Man 3 doesnt shoulder well. Theres a certain desperation evident in the plots busyness and a bloated quality that may come from having too many villains too many characters too many big set pieces - and too much money to toss around. Although Sony Pictures denies it there are reports that the second sequel in this billion-dollar franchise tallies up as the priciest release in Hollywood history with combined production and marketing costs of 500 million. Even if the sum is 200 million less than that its a ridiculous amount of money and it doesnt really show on-screen Spider-Man 3 once again directed by Sam Raimi suffers like its predecessors from video-game syndrome. The big special-effects action sequences with Spidey projectiling those webs and swinging through skyscraper canyons like Tarzan on steroids never ever feel ""real."" But they dont feel fresh anymore. Theyre just cool computer-graphic shots mixed with stunt-double acrobatics. The screenwriters (Raimi his older brother Ivan and veteran Hollywood wordsmith Alvin Sargent are credited) have forgotten one of the essentials of the Marvel comic books and one the writing team embraced in Spider-Man 2. In that movie as Spidey whirls spins and kapows he doesnt stop talking issuing one smart-aleck riposte after another. But in Spider-Man 3 our hero mostly preens or broods. A big part of that has to do with the aforementioned intergalactic goop Whatever that black substance is its fixed itself on Parker (soft-spoken boy-man Tobey Maguire) ""amplifying aggressive characteristics."" Its like hubris-slime It sticks makes you swell-headed and compels you to try on that new all-black costume thats mysteriously appeared in your closet. Welcome to the Dark Side - or the side where most of L.A.s talent agents live. Peter/Spideys new smug swaggering ways do make for one of this overstuffed sequels more entertainingly oddball sequences Pumped on his own pomposity Maguires Parker struts down the street like Travolta in Saturday Night Fever believing himself irresistible to the ladies (they just sneer or flee). At a nightclub where girlfriend Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) is performing Peter brings that other blonde Gwen (Bryce Dallas Howard) along. Then he starts hoofing on the bar like Astaire amped up on testosterone. Its a first a Marvel superhero song-and-dance routine. Along with Maguire and Dunst Spider-Man regulars Julie Harris (as Peters wise beloved Aunt May) J.K. Simmons (the Daily Bugles blustery editor in chief) and James Franco (millionaire scion Harry Osborn) are all back for more. Franco serves double duty Hes Parkers old school buddy and rival for the heart of Mary Jane and hes also the ""New Goblin"" taking over from his dead dad the Green Goblin (Part 2s Willem Dafoe) and blaming Spider-Man for his fathers demise. But one villains not enough Enter Thomas Haden Church as Flint Marko a hulking prisoner-on-the-run who stumbles into a top-secret science experiment and emerges as Sandman a shape-shifting behemoth with the body mass of a grain silo. Apparently two villains arent enough either. Topher Grace (whos sort of Tobey Maguire with irony) appears as Eddie Brock the ambitious young photojournalist wholl stop at nothing to gain a staff job at the Daily Bugle. Brock gets contaminated by the same black ooze from outer space thats buggin Spidey. Suddenly Grace is suited up in black reptilian spandex and sprouting fangs (it makes it hard to deliver those lines). His name Venom. A cautionary tale about the danger of letting success and superheroism go to your head Spider-Man 3 kicks off this Summer of Sequels in big loud occasionally clever but more often meandering ways. Its not dull exactly but neither is it much fun. Spider-Man 3 1/2 (Out of four stars) Directed by Sam Raimi written by Sam Raimi Ivan Raimi and Alvin Sargent based on the comic book created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko photography by Bill Pope distributed by Sony Pictures.

"Spideys muddled return - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeSpideys muddled returnVILLAIN COUNT UNDERMINES SPIDER-MAN 3By Bruce NewmanMercury NewsPosted 05/02/2007 024143 PM PDTUpdated 05/02/2007 040051 PM PDTClick photo to enlargeTobey Maguire as Spider-Man in ""Spider-Man 3.""<<1>>There are so many super-villains buzzing around like flies in ""Spider-Man 3"" that the web of plots subplots flashbacks and unnecessary character amplifications makes it feel more like ""Spider-Man3."" Everything in this third installment of the popular franchise has been pumped full of noise and hot air and the stakes raised to the third power. But Spidey cubed is only about half as good as he was last time. ""Spider-Man 3"" which also can be seen in a large-screen Imax version opens throughout the Bay Area Thursday. After serving up the insidious Doc Ock - a hugely satisfying mechanically limbed baddie - in ""Spider-Man 2"" director Sam Raimi obviously has decided that when it comes to evil super-villains less is just less. This is meant to be a test of character for Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) for whom everything seems to be going just fine as the movie begins. Peter sees himself as a guy with extremely high job satisfaction (hes Spider-Man after all) and hes surrounded by people he cares about. With friends like Harry (James Franco) - his bipolar best pal who frequently talks to an oil painting of his barking-mad dead dad - and his flighty girlfriend Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) Peter doesnt need enemies.Advertisement But he gets them in triplicate starting with Harry whos still trying to avenge his fathers death at Spideys sticky hands two movies ago. Fortunately he suffers what the doctors diagnose as a ""short-term memory loss"" a period defined mostly by its convenience to the plot. After Harry is temporarily neutralized Spidey is still bedeviled by A black puddle of sludge More on this later. Sandman An escaped convict named Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) whose greatest crimes are his apparent lack of fashion sense (he changes into wide horizontal stripes after busting out of jail) and his willingness to do whatever it takes to get money to buy the medicine that will save his dying daughter. (She looks surprisingly healthy by the way although still not as good as Willem Dafoe the Green Goblin and Harrys late father who as we may have mentioned has been dead for two movies.) As luck would have it while attempting to escape the police dragnet Flint jumps a fence and lands in the middle of a particle physics test site. His molecules are immediately rearranged and his body is reconstituted as a shape-shifting sand spit. Yet the wide stripes on his shirt remain mysteriously unaffected. Venom Peters new rival for the job of Spider-Man photographer at the Daily Bugle is Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) whose personality is best summed up by a scene in which he goes to church and prays to Christ on the cross asking him to kill Peter Parker. As uh luck would have it at that very moment Peter is up in the church bell tower extricating himself from an evil ball of tar that came from outer space. The black goop then drips down on Eddie. This instantly turns him into a super-villain whose primary powers are the ability to make his cowl retract from his face like a convertible top and what appears to be a super-retainer that turns his teeth into fangs. Eddie has the hots for blond bombshell Gwen Stacy but Gwen has her eyes on the web-spinning prize. This new character is played by Bryce Dallas Howard former ethereal ingenue in such M. Night Shyamalan oddities as ""Lady in the Water"" and ""The Village"" who looks more like Gwen Stefani here. As a rival for Spider-Mans affections she provides a welcome counterpoint to the ickfest that the relationship between Peter and Mary Jane has become. Will somebody please explain the big attraction to M.J. for me? She sings flat whines constantly and in this movie rarely even bothers to brush her stringy rust-colored hair. A well-deserved bad review for her singing sends her into a tailspin and because Peter is so pleased with how well things are going for him she decides that hes not ""there for her."" Sweet sensitive psychotic Harry is more in tune with M.J.s needs and while hes tending to them Peter is letting Spideys fame go to his head. ""They love me"" he exclaims at one point. One of the funniest sequences in the movie is the chronicle of that swelling pride as Peter struts through a musical montage that makes him look like a cross between the irrepressible Tony Manero of ""Saturday Night Fever"" and the irredeemable Buddy Love of ""The Nutty Professor."" They are but two additions to the vast menagerie of heroes and villains wandering through ""Spider-Man3."" After a fight with another of their number Spidey is left shaking the sand out of his cowl and wondering aloud ""Where do all these guys come from?"" Good question.

For 2 hours and 19 minutes Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) in the guise of his web-spurting alter ego does fierce battle with a dissolving molecular-mutant shape-shifter called Sandman who might have risen from the digital desert of a Mummy sequel. He also confronts Venom a reptile-headed prancer of an alien as well as Harry Osborn (James Franco) his old comrade/nemesis whos all too eager to retrofit the Green Goblin mask and flying skateboard of his late father. On the home front Peter must deal with a girlfriend the lovely Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) who feels frozen out by him not to mention the biggest baddie of all the hidden demon that lurks inside. All in all thats a heavy burden to pile on Tobey Maguires star-child gawk and perpetually curled baby lips. Its also a lot to ask of moviegoers who in this jumbly sometimes fun sometimes dispirited sprawl of a sequel end up getting more bang for their buck...and also less. Spider-Man 3 has terrific moments but after the danger and majesty and romantic brio of Spider-Man 2 those adrenalized rooftop ballets feel more than ever like sequences hermetic action miracles cooked up in the effects lab with a story patched around them. Sam Raimi directing his third Spidey adventure (the script is by Raimi his brother Ivan and Alvin Sargent) tosses together the rivalries criminals and amorous mishaps like salad and he contrives a way to make Spider-Man into a figure of ""alienated"" vengeance without ever risking the tiniest sliver of audience market share. In Spider-Man 3 an asteroid crashes just as in the old 50s sci-fi movies and out of the fiery rock emerges a sticky shiny black tangle -- beware Its the crawling audiotape -- that for no discernible reason heads straight for Peter infesting his cruddy apartment like fleas waiting for a dog. The alien stickum is searching for a host and when it finds one it brings out the hosts latent dark side. His suit now black as a tire Spidey possessed leaps over rooftops pursuing a foe to what looks like a grisly demise. This time he has a private stake in the square-off Sandman before emerging Hulk-like from a grand atomic snafu was a desperate criminal named Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) who may have been responsible for the murder of Peters uncle. The movie tells us after the fact that Spidey was doing his best to kill Sandman yet the vengeful act in question looks closer to an accident so the distinction between the ""good"" and ""bad"" Spider-Man is never more than cosmetic. It boils down to how abstractly demonic he looks in that shineless black suit. Peter by contrast wears the dark side on his sleeve if not his designer lapels. Hes exorcising a more profound demon the curse of nerdishness which makes Maguire play every scene with the same dorky strangled whine and am I just nice or trying to get you to join a cult? good-guy stare. Theres got to be an escape from that Tobey daze and as the crawling audiotape from space takes over Peter lets loose and Maguire lets his hair down -- or at least lets a shock of it fall onto his forehead. It does him good. As he saunters down the sidewalk in a black suit doing snappy Rat Pack things with his fingers Maguire seems to be enjoying himself even if it isnt clear whether the girls are giggling at him because Peter is suddenly sexy or because he seems to have lost his mind. When he wanders into a jazz bar where M.J. now estranged from him is singing a set he looks tough talks tough and finally takes over the floor of the club. At last we see the secret that lies in Spider-Mans heart Its Peter Parkers desire to dance as if he were in a revival of Cabaret. Okay I kid but its only because Raimi sets up the whole dark-side-of-a-hero business and then treats it like a Jim Carrey joke. Meanwhile the movie lurches along on quasi-contrivances. You never see why M.J. after being fired from her play neglects to tell Peter or why on a day honoring Spider-Man hes willing to jab at her jealousy by restaging their famous upside-down kiss with the blond tart Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard). Topher Grace as Peters rival photographer a smarm in frosted Brad Pitt hair brings the movie a welcome dose of seething energy. And lets not take the effects scenes for granted. A few of them are indelible like a vertiginous sky-high office disaster that evokes 9/11 or Sandmans tornado-to-giant-fist morphings or the climax with its scary plunging taxicabs. Spider-Man 3 is product but its a machine that tickles your eyes.

Secret identity crisis - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Events    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Secret identity crisis Spider-Man faces new rivals including his own freewheeling dark side By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  May 2 2007 We all know Tobey Maguire spends a lot of time in the Spider-Man movies on his best behavior. But for one comical stretch in Spider-Man 3 (which to the relief of zillions opens everywhere tomorrow night at 1159) Maguire wilds out. The explanation is a long one. But basically an inky substance from outer space follows Peter Parker home invades his Spider-Man uniform and introduces him to the ample thrills of being bad -- as bad as somebody who suddenly looks like he fell in with Fall Out Boy can be.Peter wears this new black suit beneath his street clothes like an undershirt. Soon his jeans get a little tighter his patience a little thinner and his hair long enough to flip in hilariously cocky irritation. He struts down the streets of Manhattan in a dual state of geeky entitlement and Travoltan bliss while some lite disco-funk plays around him -- hes got night fever. The ladies who stop to check him out arent turned on. But hes impressed himself. Its as if over night Peter has gone from lowly bio-chemistry student to biotech jerk. Dont worry. Its a phase.Under the playful yet perceptive direction of Sam Raimi Spider-Man has always been about its characters psychological and emotional tribulations. But this sequence feels fresh because its a real release. The rest of Spider-Man 3 is an intricately plotted saga which takes our hero from adolescence to adulthood. After six years the franchise may be familiar and lucrative yet it hasnt curdled into a burdensome series of ones zeroes and dollar signs.This time the villains -- including Thomas Haden Church as Sandman -- arent villainous so much as misunderstood pains in the neck. Dark forces spring from the central characters self-doubt and life-size insecurities from human personality crises.In the opening minutes Peter and his girlfriend Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) are ecstatically in love when we catch up with them. By the end the previous movie he had come out to her as Spider-Man and now her stage career has taken off.After the opening night of her new musical they lie in a deluxe web and stargaze in a park. The sight of Maguire and Dunst whos as radiant and vulnerable as ever suspended like that making out is a wonderful image simultaneously innocent weird and erotic. Then in the background a glowing meteor blazes softly to earth and that black blob oozes out. Peter and Mary Jane are gleefully oblivious driving off on his motorbike as the goop affixes itself to the fender.This could well be the opening scene from a 1950s B horror flick and points to a gleeful hook of the Spider-Man series The coolest thing about these movies is how uncool they are. Raimi gives us Eisenhower-era squareness that blooms in a technologically state-of-the-art New York. Spider-Man exists out of time so the walk say from Natalie Wood to Kirsten Dunst is very short. SPIDEY-MANIASee photo galleries trailers and more on Spider-Man 3 at boston.com/films.THIRD_LINE_WHITESPACEIn any case Peter and MJ as he calls Mary Jane dont have equilibrium for long. She wants a little humility but he loves that New York loves Spider-Man. Right before he can ask her to marry him she walks out in frustration. On the bright side she finally seems to have a found a flattering hair color.Meanwhile Peter and Harry (James Franco) who when we meet him is still seething at Peter/Spider-Man for killing his father the Green Goblin achieve an accidental rapprochement. A show-stopping fight between them in the first 20 minutes leaves Harry with a memory-erasing concussion that temporarily reboots their friendship. When Harry gets home from the hospital he and Peter share some boyish horseplay around his penthouse. Its a gentle affectionate contrast to their near-murderous brawl a few days before.Maguire and Franco still seem to be enjoying themselves after all these years. You really miss Francos easy-going nature when hes gone for too long. But the editing is so smartly paced that the second you want to see him there he is.The script keeps Maguire on the move but part of the reason this movie sails along with such deceptive effortlessness is that he keeps finding energetic new gears to play this character. Peter began as an affable nerd whose powers shocked him. Then he became a cauldron of emo disaffection wanting love but too meek and selfish to declare himself. Now hes on the cusp of adulthood struggling to balance his emerging self-confidence his intense affection for MJ and the exhaustion of working two jobs that still keep him living in a dumpy apartment. (Crime may not pay but from the looks of it neither does stopping it.) He keeps a police scanner beside his bed and has to face the possibility that Sandman may have killed his Uncle Ben. Throughout Maguire makes it all look like the easiest acting hes ever done.Raimi who shares script credit with his brother Ivan and Alvin Sargent strikes an exquisite balance between pop and woe drama and whooshing adventure. The series has the shadows and demons of Tim Burtons two Batman films but the sensibility is very comic book. Bill Nunn Elizabeth Banks and the rousing J.K. Simmons as the implacable editor J. Jonah Jameson resume their roles at the Daily Bugle where Peter works as a freelance photographer giving the film a screwball zing.This time Peter finds himself competing with an arrogant new hotshot Eddie Brock (played by Topher Grace) whom Jameson will grant a staff job should he find incriminating photos of Spider-Man. With the new black suit -- which for Peter becomes a freeing id -- catching naughty Spidey could get easier.This by the way is a movie of intense replacement and doubling. Grace is Maguires lankier more sardonic doppelganger. Like Peter Harry discovers another self. Even Mary Jane gets an opposite number in Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard) a blond model whom Bad Peter starts seeing.Describing Spider-Man 3 as busy is an understatement. It sets out to accomplish a lot maybe too much The film lasts well over two hours and toward the climactic fight sequence fatigue starts to set in.To their credit though Raimi and his big hard-working crew are determined to dazzle (the budget is rumored to be almost 300 million) even at the risk of bombarding us with pleasure people images action and real feeling. The movie has the curious effect of leaving you over-fulfilled. When its done any appetite for another event picture even one half as well made as this is temporarily curbed.Dont get me wrong. Blockbusters with this much going on should come along more often. But they should also come with a doggie bag.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Maybe not quite as cool as Alfred Molinas many-tentacled Doc Octavius in the sequel ""Spidey 3s"" evil Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) is nonetheless a brute an ex-con with the voice of Lee Marvin and - after being demolecularized in an industrial accident - the body of a 30-foot sand sculpture in the shape of the Hulk. The other new villain is Venom aka Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) an ambitious freelance photographer who aims to elbow Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) out of the way and take over his staff job at the Daily Bugle. Hah. For his troubles Eddie ends up covered in the Black Goo that arrives on a meteorite in the opening scenes and drapes people in a bad attitude. First the Goo attaches itself to Spider-Mans red suit turning both Spidey and Peter into egocentric bullies destroying Spideys reputation as a super-hero and sending Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) into the arms of Peters friend Harry Osborn (James Franco). The plot - and the Goo - thicken. Harry blames Spider-Man for the death of his father the late great Green Goblin and has been secretly training with his dads weapons with revenge on his mind. Way too much of the films two-hour 20-minute running time is devoted to quiet conversations the on-again/off-again romance between Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson (which is really starting to bug me) or to Peters silly antics under the influence of the Goo. But Ill take a wild guess and say that Spidey fans come for the action and on that count they will not be disappointed. jmathewsnydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

By Anthony Lane Spider-Man gets a makeover in Sam Raimis movie.   Credit ISTVAN BANYAI There is one great scene in ""Spider-Man 3"" and you can pretty much leave the theatre once its over but for those three or four minutes you wouldnt want to be anywhere else. An escaped convict named Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) flees the New York City police and tumbles as you do into a Particle Physics Test Facility. He finds himself in a sandpit subjected to what we are told is ""demolecularization"" a process familiar to anyone who pounds crackers to make a cheesecake crust. Once the experiment is over the sand lies still; then it stirs and heaves and like a crumbling Lazarus Marko rises again his legs sifting and scattering with the effort. Finally he staggers upright to reveal his transfigured self Sandman his flesh and blood blown away for good and an odd look--part mourning part implacable resolve--dimly discernible on his granular face. From here on he will be storming dust a wondrous mixture of the quick and the dead. It is thrilling to imagine what Guillermo del Toro who made ""Pans Labyrinth"" or the James Cameron who brought us ""Terminator 2 Judgment Day"" would do with Sandman. Both directors are obsessed with shapeshifters--with their sad restlessness their ability to conjure threat out of the apparently fragile. The director of ""Spider-Man 3"" Sam Raimi is unconcerned by such niceties; to him Sandman is just a bullying baddie against whom Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) must pit his web and his wits. The film is certainly well stocked with villainy. Besides Sandman there is the New Goblin (James Franco) better known as Harry Osborn of whom I had personally had my fill by the end of the first movie. He is the son of the late Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe) and his agonized drawn-out desire to make Spider-Man pay for that death makes Hamlets revenge look like a snap decision. We also have Venom (Topher Grace) who is introduced with something close to panic two-thirds of the way through the film. Until then he has been known as Eddie Brock who takes over from Peter Parker--the earthbound off-duty Spider-Man--as a photographer for the Daily Bugle. Eddie then gets fired and his response in a radical solution to youth unemployment is to don a sticky black body stocking and a mouthful of fangs. The most pathetic aspect of ""SpiderMan 3"" is that stickiness. In an early scene a meteorite crashes to Earth and from it crawls what seems to be a tiny garbage sack with half a mind of its own not a bad image of where this film belongs. And would you believe the first person this superblob attaches itself to is yes Peter Parker. It doesnt choose him; nobody has targeted him--of all Earths inhabitants he just happens to be close by. Is this truly the best that the filmmakers can be bothered to do for our delight? Just how easily and stupidly pleased do they presume we are? Peters college professor (Dylan Baker) declares that the black stuff ""amplifies characteristics of its host."" Fine and I vaguely understand what occurs when it latches onto Eddie. The first host however is Spider-Man himself and this is where the film becomes so embarrassing that you have to crouch down and stuff popcorn in your ears. The joke about Peter has always been how uncool he is. ""You are such a nerd"" his girlfriend Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) sighs thus giving a breath of hope to all the nerds in the audience. Once infected by the black stuff he should by rights become an ubernerd but the movie cant decide what it wants. One moment he is being eyed by girls in the street and the next they are shying away from him as he struts along like John Travolta at the start of ""Saturday Night Fever."" You laugh but the sound of it dies in your throat. Peter then dances in a night club but unveiling a mean and moody Tobey Maguire is roughly as convincing as asking Norah Jones to rap. Dumbest of all is the change of hair style as Peter stops combing his bangs sideways and lets them flop down over his brow. He looks like the bronze medalist in a teen-age Hitler-impersonation contest. Spider-Man meanwhile gets his own makeover oiling into a different outfit (black is the new red) and hanging out moodily on church spires. What is being amplified here?  If ""Spider-Man 3"" is a shambles thats because it makes the rules up as it goes along. By the end for instance Sandman has become the size of an office block each swinging fist as big as a truck his personality reduced to brutishness. I half expected him to come after Spider-Man and Mary Jane carrying a gigantic bucket and spade. By what criterion did he grow so mountainous? Is he like a Transformer or more like a genie? The fact is that if the fantastical is to flourish it must lay down the conditions of its magic and abide by them; otherwise we feel cheated. (Tolkien knew this better than anyone.) Some viewers will take the New Goblin whose name sounds like a small-circulation poetry magazine to be a vessel of unnatural forces while others will see him when he fires up his rocket-powered skateboard as a rich kid with too many toys. Thats the problem with this third installment of the franchise not that its running out of ideas or lifting them too slavishly from the original comic but that it lunges at them with an infantile lack of grace throwing money at one special effect after another and praying--or calculating--that some of them will fly. In May of 2006 the Wall Street Journal suggested that the budget for Raimis film had swollen to more than two hundred and fifty million dollars possibly to three hundred million. Thats a lot of dough. The government paid less than that in foreign aid to Haiti last year. Still if the movie performs as expected the outlay will be swamped by the profit and one cannot fault Sony and Columbia Pictures for their business sense. What matters to a moviegoer is that costs appear to rise in inverse proportion to formal coherence the more you spend to judge by ""Spider-Man 3"" the less control you exert over the finished product. Domestic scenes that would not pass muster in a TV soap are allowed to drag on forever (""I want to be there for you"" ""You werent there for me"") while major plot shifts--the teaming up of Venom and Sandman say--are patched together in seconds. Fine character actors such as James Cromwell and Theresa Russell are handed a token scene and then flicked aside like chewed gum. Bryce Dallas Howard whose pale and unnerving looks would make her a perfect villainess is fobbed off with a role of smiling fluff. Laziness mingles with overkill violence with mawkishness most of the characters weep at the slightest provocation but heads are beaten burned and sheared off by passing subway trains. ""People really like me"" our hero says at the start adding later ""They love me"" Not for long Whiny-Man not for long. Has Sir Ian Holm ever given a bad performance? More to the point have you ever seen him even in a small or fleeting role fail to assume a commanding position--not hogging the limelight but pointing briskly to the unexpected heart of the film? Like Claude Rains another compact Englishman with a lovely and questioning voice Holm seems to gather a movie toward him like a priest with his congregation. That was the case with his royal doctor in ""The Madness of King George"" and it holds true for another doctor Ernesto Morales the Argentinian psychoanalyst Holm plays in ""The Treatment."" Morales describes himself as ""the last great Freudian"" and the claim is neither a joke nor a boast. He sits in his New York consulting room clad in his professional armor of cardigan tie and sports jacket and calmly dismembers the life--and more witheringly the syntax--of a hapless English teacher named Jake Singer (Chris Eigeman). ""Constructing passive sentences is a way of concealing your own testicles lest someone cut them off"" Morales says with no more fuss than a butcher jointing a chicken. Oren Rudavskys movie which he and Daniel Saul Housman adapted from Daniel Menakers 1998 novel (parts of which first appeared in this magazine) is a slight and rueful affair intermittently funny about Jakes attempt to equip himself for the giving and receiving of love. The object of his affections is Allegra Marshall (Famke Janssen) a mother at the private school where Jake teaches. She is tall luminescent recently widowed disturbingly wealthy and to my eyes hundreds of miles out of Jakes league; even as the story clasped them together I was hoping that she might escape and do better elsewhere. Dr. Morales is also dubious about the union being concerned solely with ""the healthy sexual interest between you and this dowager."" Not that healthy I would say; this is one of those courteous tales in which people make love with their clothes on. Who wants to behave well in bed? As the lovers work through their issues Dr. Morales is shunted to the sidelines. It is as though to the directors discomfort he had seen through not just their earnest romance but the civil erudite mood of the movie. As he says to Jake ""You make from the world a banal comedy and you are a spectator. You even have a name for it life in the city."" And with that an entire genre on TV as well as on film falls apart in our useless hands.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Web 3.0 Spider-Man 3 is too good-hearted (and lofty). Also would someone just let Kirsten Dunst fall already? _ By David Edelstein ShareThis Illustration by Paul Willoughby  (Photo Courtesy of Sony Pictures) Spider-Man 3 is the latest quasi-religious comic-book superhero epic to demonstrate that with extreme power comes extreme spiritual torment that there are grave psychological dangers when the mask (in the Pirandellian sense) supplants the face and that the practice of throwing around insane amounts of cash while getting absurdly rich off tent-pole studio franchises can make even an ecstatic horror maven like Sam Raimi a little flabby. For Raimi this is meant to be the Big Onethe most spectacular monsters the most grown-up relationships the most Sunday-school homilies. The movie isnt a dud It has exuberant bits and breathtaking (money money money) effects. But its supposed to be fun and inspirational and its too leaden for liftoff. This is a trend Since the angst-ridden (and deeply expressive) Tim Burton Batman there havent been many simple straight-ahead superhero movies. Ang Lees Hulk groaned under cheap Freudian baggage and even Superman in Superman Returns took to his bed in a lingering depression. But in Spider-Man and especially Spider-Man 2 Raimi got the balance right. The bashful dorky Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire with his soft features and pale blue eyes) had to cope as all adolescent males must with sudden sticky excretions and to live up to his newfound potency by facing his fears (among them declaring his ardor for Mary Jane the buoyant Kirsten Dunst). It was too bad that at regular intervals this grounded character metamorphosed into a weightless little video-game Luigi swinging through a cartoon cityscape. In the sequel the FX were more tightly woven into the drama; the villain played by the soulful Alfred Molina had more dramatic stature; and the love story was a few notches up the evolutionary scale from adolescent infatuation. It was both amusing and affecting to watch a hero so conflicted that neither side of him human or superhuman functioned properly. His Spider-Man 3 trajectory is more of a slog. At the start Spidey is a celeb (hes even bless me on the cover of this magazine)and it has gone to Peters head so that he cant begin to empathize with Mary Janes disastrous Broadway debut. (He says not to worry about the criticsgood advice) Although he still lives in a hovel Peter enjoys the perks of superheroism among them gazing on a meteor shower with his beloved in a web high above Central Park. Smooching he misses the rock that lands on cue and bears black sticky stuff with legsa blob from space with no apparent purpose except to bring out Peters Darth Spidey. The charcoal-black Spider-Man is pretty cool-looking and the black-clad Peter (with a lock over his forehead) brings off some snazzy moves in a jazz club when he tries to make Mary Jane jealous with his blonde arm candy (Bryce Dallas Howard)hes like Jerry Lewiss Buddy Love in The Nutty Professor. Its disappointing that Peter/Spidey doesnt seem particularly power-mad and that hes so easily swayed by tiresome old Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) whose scenes stop the movie cold. BACKSTORY Blocked streets were plentiful during the five weeks Spider-Man 3 shot in Manhattan last spring but not all of the skyscraper backdrops are authentic. The city wouldnt suspend traffic for the six days needed to film a climactic chase scene so Sam Raimi chose the next best thing Cleveland. The priciest movie in history (somewhere between 270 and 500 million depending on whos counting) this was also the first film to take advantage of the Cleveland Convention Center. The crew even threw a public wrap party. Hes also upstaged by three (count em) antagonists Harry Son of Goblin Osborn (James Franco) still bent on vengeance for his fathers death; Venom (Topher Grace) a jackass photographer who has been black-slimed; and most memorably the Sandman (Thomas Haden Church plus 6782 computer artists and programmers) an escaped con who was pulverized in one of those many hazardous particle-physics labs that dot the marshlands around New York City. Haden Church is an inspired choice for the role since his groggy voice matches up with the behemoth who has to practice (in an exquisite sequence) holding together the millions of grains that constitute (and reconstitute) his body and who swirls around the city to the strains of Christopher Youngs Night on Bald Mountainstyle strings. The clashes between Spider-Man and his foes still look a tad video-game-esque but who cares with all the rock-em-sock-em new permutationsthe spiraling midair collisions the Sandmans thunderous fist? Todays kids have more incentive to study math and physics better CGI superhero battles Whats missing? Momentum. A touch of meanness. A centrifugal threat like Molinas octopus man. (In terms of dramatic stature the three villains here dont add up to one Doc Ock.) The script by Ivan Raimi and Alvin Sargent wears its heart on its web It pointlessly revises the murder of Peters uncle so he can forgive the new culprit and gives nothing new to J. K. Simmons whose once hilarious snarling editor is now a tiresome fellow. I lost count of the number of times Dunst plunges from a building during the climaxenough to make you think Put her on the ground or let her fall Its fun to see Raimi stalwart Bruce Campbell channel Peter Sellerss Clouseau but apart from the Sandman and the nightclub dance my favorite thing in the movie is when a rejected Peter fishes an engagement ring out of a Champagne glass with a fork small poetic perfect. 1 2 Next Share this story...

The three main recurring characters get stuck in a rut and the same can be said of the film itself in ""Spider-Man 3."" After the significant improvement of the second installment over the first new entry reps a roughly equivalent dip in quality and enjoyment with Spidey now giving off the faint odor of running on fumes. This devaluation shouldnt hurt at the box office at least at first as the vast majority of the fans who turned the first two into 822 million and 784 million worldwide grossers respectively will cram multiplexes around the globe to see the first blockbuster of the summer. A sense of strain envelops the proceedings this time around. One can feel the effort required to suit up one more time come up with fresh variations on a winning formula and inject urgency into a format that basically needs to be repeated and due to audience expectations cant be toyed with or deepened very much. Big problem with third Spideyis the script the very same element that elevated the second yarn. Four years back vet scenarist Alvin Sargent with a story assist from Michael Chabon enriched the premise from all angles -- emotion humor and villainy. This time the magic has eluded Sargent and the Raimi brothers director Sam and co-writer Ivan the result being a story that would have provenmore satisfactory for a late 60s cartoon-hero TV show than for a new-century blockbuster. At the outset everything is so hunky-dory that New York City looks like Pleasantville. Thanks to Spider-Man crime is virtually non-existent Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) is a burgeoning musical theater star and Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) still studying science at college is dorkier than ever. But evil begins to reassert itself on several fronts. As Peter and Mary Jane gaze at the stars from their spider-web hammock overlooking the city a modest ""War of the Worlds""-like meteor crashes nearby and emits a gooey black silk that slithers and slides of its own accord. A hard-outside/soft-inside criminal (Thomas Haden Church) who turns out to have been responsible for the murder of Peters beloved Uncle Ben escapes from prison and through a process that defies comprehension but is undeniably eye-catching turns into a shape-changer named Sandman who can blow through the caverns of Manhattan or become a giant hulk with fearsome pummeling power. And then there is Harry Osborn (James Franco) who still blaming Spider-Man for the death of his father decides to emulate the great green one by engineering a new designer Goblin outfit and flying board and taking to the skies to avenge his old man. Peter acquires yet another adversary in the person of Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) an aggressive street photographer who vies with Peter to capture the revelatory shot that will reveal Spider-Man for who he really is a coup that will land the winner a full-time job from editor J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons) at the Daily Bugle. The rivalry turns into outright war when Eddie morphs into one more Marvel supervillain the fanged Venom whose skills eerily match those of Spidey. Early going is enlivened by a couple high-wire action sequences a Goblin attack and especially a vertigo-inducing scene in which an out-of-control construction crane demolishes part of a nearby skyscraper sending platinum blonde Gwen (Bryce Dallas Howard) a classmate of Peters heading toward the pavement only to be saved at the last second by guess who. But the dramatic temperature is brought way down by Mary Jane whos become a real drag. Fired in a poor scene from her Broadway play she pathetically begs for attention becomes petulant when Spidey plants a public kiss on Gwen after saving her then seeks solace from Harry. In all his dealings with her Peter still acts like the prim naive high school kid he was when first seen in the series five years ago as if he hadnt learned anything through all his subsequent trials. Scripting of the many domestic scenes between Peter and women specifically Mary Jane and Rosemary Harris Aunt May is very dull and unimaginative. Scripts one big idea is to have Peter/Spidey explore his ""dark side"" a gambit of tiresome psychological value but with the obvious side benefits of temporarily suspending his goody two-shoes personality and giving him a new black costume. All the ploy really amounts to is an interlude in which Peter struts around Gotham with a trendy new haircut ogling women and humiliating Mary Jane with some aggressive nightclub antics. Given the setup Spider-Man in the end has to contend with multiple villains in a gigantic action climax that unfortunately is too reminiscent of the first films Roosevelt Island episode thanks to the similar imperilment of Mary Jane. Still Sandman is a strange and visually interesting baddie endowed by Church with a melancholy undercurrent. Grace who could plausibly have played Spider-Man himself provides a spark with something extra as Spideys first major adversary his own age. Technically pic is fully on a par with the previous entries which means the visual effects will have fans wide-eyed throughout.
