The naive heroine Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) first refers to it as ""that room of pain."" The surpassingly rich--and shades of Krafft-Ebing sexually deviant--hero Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) contends that the room is about pleasure. Whats for sure is that its about gain. The E.L.

By Anthony Lane Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan in Sam Taylor-Johnsons adaptation of the novel.   Credit Illustration by CONCEPCION Studios If the figures are correct ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" by E. L. James has been bought by more than a hundred million people of whom only twenty million were under the impression that it was a paint catalogue. That leaves a solid eighty million or so who upon reading sentences such as ""He strokes his chin thoughtfully with his long skilled fingers"" had to lie down for a while and let the creamy waves of ecstasy subside. Now after an enticing buildup which took to extreme lengths the art of the peekaboo the film of the book is here. Nothing has exercised the novels devotees--the Jamesians as we must think of them--quite as much as the proper occupants of the central roles. Who could conceivably play Christian Grey the awkward young billionaire with the extensive neckwear collection let alone Anastasia Steele the English-lit major who is also as we gasp to learn one of the leading virgins of Vancouver Washington? Many combinations were suggested my own preference being Nick Nolte and Barbra Streisand who made such a lovely couple in ""The Prince of Tides"" but in the end the lucky winners were Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson. Good choices I reckon especially Johnson who as the granddaughter of Tippi Hedren knows everything about predators who stare and swoop. Ana as she is usually called first meets Christian Grey at Grey House which is home to Grey Enterprises in Seattle. (Dont you adore rich men who hide themselves away?) She is there in lieu of her roommate who was meant to interview Grey for the college newspaper but has fallen sick. Ana ushered into his presence stumbles first over the threshold and then over her words but begins to melt as he expounds on his bountiful gifts. ""Ive always been good at people"" he says as though people were Scrabble or squash. He is interested in ""what motivates them--what incentivizes them."" Any woman should run a mile from a man who uses the verb ""incentivize"" but things could have been worse I guess. He could have said ""monetize."" He also lends her a pencil bearing the word ""Grey"" the tip of which she rubs against her lip. Either she has a cold sore or these folks are getting ready to rumble. Their next encounter comes at a hardware store where Christian is stocking up on masking tape cable ties and rope. ""Youre the complete serial killer"" Ana says. Now theres a thought. We know Ana reads Jane Austen and here for a second she sounds like the heroine of ""Northanger Abbey"" who is mocked for always assuming the worst or at any rate the most gothically arousing. Also Dornan is no stranger to wickedness; in ""The Fall"" a BBC drama that shows on Netflix he is a serial killer armed with a rasping beard his native Belfast accent and roughly ten times the sexual allure that he projects in ""Fifty Shades."" Could Anas fears be well founded? Is Christian a terminator? No. He is many things--a pianist a pilot a pervert and a tremendous bore--but evil is not in his wardrobe. Ana asks casually if he is a ""do-it-yourselfer."" That would explain a lot. Christian it transpires has a private passion the cause of what James calls ""his odd Ive-got-a-whopping-big-secret smile."" Down a corridor of his apartment behind a locked door lurks his Red Room. Lavishly stuffed with the tools of domestic torture it is supposed to radiate a breathless lust although the result looks more like a spread from House Beautiful. Here within these crimson walls our hero is free to express himself as a ""dominant"" meaning not that he is the fifth tone of the diatonic scale which really would be hot but rather that he constrains and chastises women who wish to be treated thus. At least thats what he tells himself. Mostly he sounds like your basic stalker ""Im incapable of leaving you alone"" he informs Ana--a notion that appears to stimulate her although it would easily warrant a call to 911. She succumbs up to a point but her recurring doubts lead Christian to dish up one of those crusty old no-means-yes propositions which feminism has battled for decades ""You want to leave? Your body tells me something different."" Pass the butt plug. So how does the movie directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson stack up against the book? And whats in it for non-Jamesians? Well we lose Anas introduction to fellatio set precariously in a bathtub; in a similar vein we skip the breakfast that she shares with Christian at an International House of Pancakes. Above all we are denied Jamess personifications which are so much livelier than her characters ""My sleepy subconscious has a final swipe at me."" ""yes My inner goddess is thrilled."" ""no my psyche screams."" Couldnt someone have got Sarah Silverman to play the psyche? On the other hand the film by dint of its simple competence--being largely well acted not too long and sombrely photographed by Seamus McGarvey--has to be better than the novel. It could hardly be worse. No new reader however charitable could open ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" browse a few paragraphs and reasonably conclude that the author was writing in her first language or even her fourth. There are poignant moments when the plainest of physical actions is left dangling beyond the reach of her prose ""I slice another piece of venison holding it against my mouth."" The global appeal of the novel has led some fans to hallow it as a classic but with all due respect it is not to be confused with ""Madame Bovary."" Rather ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" is the kind of book that Madame Bovary would read. Yet we should not begrudge E. L. James her triumph for she has in her lumbering fashion tapped into a truth that often eludes more elegant writers--that eternal disappointment deep in the human heart at the failure of our loved ones to acquire their own helipad. Much of the novels fixation with style or with the barrage of stuff that a sense of style can buy is carried onto the screen. Where the money shots should be we get shots of what money can provide. The subtle silk ties that adorned the paperback covers and which somehow made it O.K. by a dazzling sleight of the publishers hand to read soft pornography in public are arrayed in the opening scene. Ana can barely move for Audis. Christian wows her with rides first in his thunderous chopper and then in his smooth white glider presumably praying that she wont have seen Pierce Brosnan do the same in ""The Thomas Crown Affair."" The only viewer in fact who may feel shortchanged by ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" is Liam Helmer who is listed in the credits as ""BDSM Technical Consultant."" Check out the Red Room rack upon rack of cutting-edge bullwhips a variety of high-end ass paddles and more restraining cuffs than you can shake a stick at. And how much of this kit gets used? A mere fraction and even then Christian supposedly the maestro of pain can do little more than brush his cat-o-nine-tails over Anas flesh with a feathery backhand. He looks like Roger Federer practicing gentle cross-court lobs at the net. And there you have the problem with this film. It is gray with good taste--shade upon shade of muted naughtiness daubed within the limits of the R rating. Think of it as the ""Downton Abbey"" of bondage designed neither to menace nor to offend but purely to cosset the fatigued imagination. You get dirtier talk in most action movies and more genitalia in a TED talk on Renaissance sculpture. True Dakota Johnson does her best and her semi-stifled giggles suggest that unlike James she can see the funny side of all this nonsense. When Christian alarmed by Anas maidenhood considers ""rectifying the situation"" she replies ""Im a situation?""--a sharp rejoinder although if I were her Id be much more worried about the rectifying. Even Johnsons valiant performance however cannot pierce the gloom or persuade her co-star to lighten up. He brings color to her cheeks courtesy of mild slaps but she brings no light to his spirit in return. He spends half the time badgering her about a contract that has been drawn up in which she--""the Submissive""--must consent to his supremacy. Clauses and subsections are haggled over in such detail that one feels bound to ask How much of a sex film can this be given that the people most likely to be turned on by it are lawyers? ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" is being released in time for Valentines Day. Thats a bold move since the film is not just unromantic but specifically anti-romantic; take your valentine along by all means but be warned itll be like watching ""Rosemarys Baby"" at Christmas. Try holding hands as the hero taunts the rituals of sentiment such as going out for dinner and a movie ""Thats not really my thing."" What his thing actually is Lord knows although to judge by the importance that he attaches to grooming regular feeding and nicely buffed leather goods my suspicion is that he doesnt want a girlfriend at all. I know Mr. Greys whopping-big secret. He wants a pony.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

"Fifty Shades of Grey - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire Fifty Shades of Grey Posted by Christy Lemire on February 15 2015 36 Comments Universal Pictures Rated R for some strong sexual content including dialogue some unusual behavior and graphic nudity and for language. Running time 125 minutes. Three stars out of four. I liked ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" and I am not ashamed. I realize this is not the most popular opinion. The film has plummeted to 26 percent on Rotten Tomatoes as of this writing. And I dont care. I went to a screening with a girlfriend of mine -- a fellow school mom whod also read all three books -- we had a drink beforehand and giggled the whole way through. This is probably the best way to experience ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" -- slightly under the influence and with a large group -- making it all the better to surrender to the guilty pleasure of the escape. But from a perspective of evaluating the actual quality of the content Sam Taylor-Johnsons film is a vast improvement over E.L.. James best-selling page-turning source material. The first book (which I read for professional edification I swear) was inane and repetitive with an annoying interior monologue which reflected our heroines reactions to the outlandishly kinky situation into which shed stumbled. And yet I -- and millions of other self-respecting educated women -- devoured it and couldnt put it down. We had to find out what was going to happen next. We had to find out how far the innocent Anastasia Steele would go in this dark sexual world. Screenwriter Kelly Marcel has done yeomans work in stripping the text of all its adolescent idiocy (gone are Anas ""inner goddess"" and her exclamations of ""Oh my"" and ""Holy crap"") but maintaining the lines images and moments that the legions of fans would want to see. If there were a category for most-improved adaptation at the Oscars Marcel would be the clear winner. As an experience though ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" is a visual feast. Taylor-Johnson made her name as an artist before shifting to directing feature films with 2009s ""Nowhere Boy."" Here shes teamed up with cinematographer Seamus McGarvey -- a two-time Oscar nominee whose work ranges from ""Atonement"" and ""Anna Karenina"" to ""The Avengers"" and ""Godzilla"" -- to create a look thats sleek glossy and sensual. Merely the sight of billionaire bad boy Christian Greys closet sent shivers. The film is edited fluidly (especially in the much-anticipated sex scenes) and production designed beautifully. Costume designer Mark Bridges -- who frequently works with Paul Thomas Anderson and David O. Russell -- also deserves a special mention not only for recreating Christians crisp wardrobe but also for styling Anastasia in a way that vividly reflects her transition from a mousy college student to a young woman blossoming and finding her power. So yes ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" looks great. But you may have noticed that we havent talked about the actual plot. Or the relationship. Or the performances. As Anastasia Dakota Johnson is a total find. She finds a spark and a spine that the character in the book woefully lacked and she has terrific comic timing. (Thats something else about the film that makes it superior It realizes this story is ridiculous in ways the book itself never could. It has an actual sense of humor.) Johnson facially resembles her father Don Johnson but she has a presence thats reminiscent of her mother Melanie Griffith; she has a similar sweetness and directness which are appealing. Johnson must reveal herself in more ways than one throughout the film and rises to the challenge every time. ""Fifty Shades"" will make her a star and deservedly so. And then theres Jamie Dornan who co-stars as the enigmatic and beguiling Christian Grey. At least these are attributes hes supposed to exude. Hes kind of a stiff (no pun intended). Sure the former underwear model is handsome and muscular and hes really good at that thing where you reach back with one hand and pull your T-shirt over your head while flexing your abs at the same time. (He does this so many times it could be a drinking game.) But hes never as intimidating as he should be despite Anastasias insistence that he is. Perhaps Dornans restraint is intentional; after all the story is told through Anas eyes and hes supposed to be mysterious. But hes also supposed to be impossibly sexy and irresistible and thats never the case -- to the extent that the mind starts wandering to other actors who would have been a better fit. Charlie Hunnam originally was cast in the role then changed his mind. (I always pictured a Matthew McConaughey type when I was reading the book -- someone handsome and slick but with a slightly dangerous vibe -- but hes too old. Christian is supposed to be 27.) Yet Johnson and Dornan manage to create a decent and sometimes lively chemistry with each other -- a topic which has inspired no shortage of gossip and speculation. This is especially true in the scenes in which they remain fully clothed bantering and negotiating as they flirt feel each other out and find some BDSM boundaries which are mutually acceptable. A quick plot summary for those who have been living under a rock Anastasia Steele is a college senior who visits Christian Grey at his imposing Seattle office to interview him for the school paper on behalf of her sick roommate Kate (Eloise Mumford). Christian is the enormously successful founder of some vague tech company whos giving this years commencement address. Hes also a notoriously eligible bachelor. But when Ana staggers into his office and falls on her hands and knees looking up at him nervously with her big blue eyes the secret dominant in him is instantly intrigued. From there its a traditional romantic tale of boy meets girl boy seduces girl boy makes girl sign a non-disclosure agreement boy ties up blindfolds and spanks girl. Boy also stalks girl showing up uninvited when shes out drinking with her friends or enjoying lunch in Florida with her mom . (Shes played by an underused Jennifer Ehle; Marcia Gay Harden similarly has little to do as Christians mother.) Christian famously ""exercises control in all things Miss Steele"" but the film definitely underplays the creepy needy power-mad elements of his personality -- facets which were forged in his fucked-up childhood which well get to by book three. But he also buys her a car And takes her hang-gliding And he provides the previously virginal Anastasia with unprecedented orgasms in the so-called Red Room of Pain. Much has been made of the perceived subversive transgressive nature of Christians proclivities but ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" is the rare mainstream film that talks about sex -- and the way people connect through sex -- in refreshingly candid ways. And it does end up being rather traditional in terms of the relationship dynamics that emerge. Christian and Ana meet each other halfway but while she learns about the fun that can be had while blindfolded he learns to open his eyes to the possibility of romance and even love. Shes the submissive in the equation but she ultimately bends him to her will. And -- spoiler alert -- by the third book ""Fifty Shades Freed"" theres even marriage a home and a baby.

It had plenty of promise but ultimately that promise went out the window once I realized that there was hardly anything interesting to these characters. Good review Christy. Reply February 15 2015  by  MovieJay (MovieJay)     Yes yes yes I believe the hype machine was only useful this time at generating hype not actual information. I was led to believe this was supposed to be wildly offensive stuff. Or that it reflects the fantasies of bored and lonely woman. Neither of those claims are true. In its own totally trashy way the movie subverts its own patriarchal-dominated genre within the confines of traditional trashy romance tropes. It wont win any Oscars and wont find a home on my year-end list but I certainly cant call it bad. I can see how more literal-minded people might confuse it for bad though. Reply February 15 2015  by  MovieJay (MovieJay)     ...of A bored and lonely woman I meant. Sowry. Reply February 15 2015  by  Becca     I liked your review. Thank you for your candid and honest take on this much anticipated film. I too am an educated woman who found the writing very blase at times but I too could not put the books down. I will hopefully see the movie soon based off your review. Reply February 15 2015  by  Rhonda     Thanks for sharing. I felt the exact same way about the movie. Reply February 16 2015  by  Karla     Its a Twilight fanfic The history of this story needs to be made as public as the story is. Because the main characters are just alternate-reality Edward and Bella in an Samp;M relationship. It was never MEANT to be taken as serious literature because it was written for ""lemons"". It wasnt even good fanfic when it came out in 2009. I just feel like people are being dupped because there are thousands of people who read the Twilight fic (originally called Master and Servant) and know the story of how it became a novel. I guess it would one thing if the author cited her source material and then everyone would be like ""Oh I see."" But they are putting this out there as original work when ALL of the characters were based on the Twilight universe. It feels so disingenuous to have it out there without transparency. Reply February 16 2015  by  justin     my fiance had been talking about this movie for MONTHS saying she couldnt wait till valentines day for us to go see it....well all the hype about how she had read the books and couldnt wait to see the movie actually had me somewhat excited thinking about how shed be raring to go once we got home....well to say the least the movie absolutely sucked...sure lots of bondage and a small dose of romance/flirting that went along with it but this movie BORED me so bad im in the doghouse now because it was SO boring i actuallyshe claims i fell asleep and now she claims we need to take a break...lol...all because of some idiot took a supposedly kick ass freak book and ruined it to the point of boredom...i swear when the movie ended there were SEVERAL women who actually broke out in laughter no doubt because of just how STUPID the movie ended up being...thanks a lot whoever you are who wrotedirectedand produced this film...may actually have cost me a true one of a kind relationship because the boredom level was just too much for me to handle...justin toole 387 Reply February 17 2015  by  Christina     Dont worry Justin I agree with you by far the stupidest boring movie ever I almost fell asleep myself and if your girlfriend is going to break up with you over something as stupid as that then she is not meant for you. I think she is just taking it out on you because she knows your right and you had every right to fall asleep but she doesnt want to admit it because she made a big deal about it and it was highlyhighly disappointing so hang in there Justin I hope you find someone who is going to make you happy she obviously didnt care enough about you to get mad over something so stupid especially when the movie was stupid. Reply February 18 2015  by  Elana     Dude you need to find yourself a smarter girl. Reply February 16 2015  by  TB     Before claiming "" the rare mainstream film that talks about sex""; see Australian film The Little Death. 5/5 for it. Reply February 16 2015  by  Trevor     Take note of the word ""mainstream"". Very few have heard of The Little Death. Thats not mainstream. Reply February 16 2015  by  Luke     Spot the feminist Reply February 16 2015  by  Titus     Huh? Reply February 16 2015  by  Michael Moore     Im curious whether youve seen Dornan in the TV series The Fall. He is really good in that yet from the 50 Shades trailers (I havent seen the whole movie) I am not surprised to read that he comes off as stiff and dull in the movie. I was hoping that impression was just an artifact of the way the trailers were edited. Its too bad because he really is capable of doing excellent work and holding his own in the company of Gillian Anderson. I wonder what went wrong here. Anyway thats for the good review. Reply February 16 2015  by  Michael Moore     Uh that was supposed to be ""thanks for the good review."" Sorry Reply February 18 2015  by  Elana     He looks stiff because he HATED the movie. He thought it was gross and stupid...actually so did everyone else on the set. Imagine having to do something you really dont Wang to but signed a contract. Thats pretty much how everyone involved with the film feels...except for EL James. Reply July 18 2016  by  Lorraine Shaw     Having read 50 Shades of Grey"" I concluded that Jamie Dorman is an excellent actor...his facial expressions are fantastic.....you could tell what he was thinking as Christian Grey...Screenwriter Kelley Marcel is to be congratulated in saving the plot from the annoying redundancies E.L. wrote over and over. Ms Marcel almost made a good movie of the plot she has to work with. Reply February 17 2015  by  Christina     I think this movie was by far the stupidest movie ever made and I have seen some really stupid movies before I think it should get 5 rotten tomatoes instead of 5 stars. It was by far the longest hour and 50 minutes of my life I could never get back. I read the books they are amazing and they should of just left it at that no movie should of came of this because you cant really call it a movie I mean there wasnt really a story the two main characters had no chemistry it is easy to throw two people together and have them ""act"" there way through and that is exactly what these two characters did they acted through the sex scenes I didnt really see no spark and how unrealistic is it that Anastatia would actually be a senior in college and still be a virgin I mean really I am sorry but in todays generation there is no such thing as college virgins give me a break that right there was just where I was like this movie is so ridiculous and unrealistic it should be renamed 50 shades of stupid and unrealistic. So disappointed Reply February 17 2015  by  Ryan     My wife and I really enjoyed the movie and Im glad to see that were not alone I especially hope this movie paves the way for more films willing to explore sexuality specifically for women Reply February 22 2015  by  anthony     No wonder the divide between men and women is getting wider. All women do is complain about being objects....yet if a man doesnt have a huge penis or a ripped body he is considered useless. This is not good and I really feel sad for my own children having to grow up in a society that cares very little for its young men. Hollywood is owned by women and gay men. There is no room for the avg white male anymore. I think that mars trip sounds pretty good at this point. Prostitution is on the rise for a reason. Dad always said watch out for the fat and flat women for a reason. Is their anyway we can start a movement to end suffrage. Reply March 4 2015  by  hudson     You really need to watch more foreign films. Reply February 18 2015  by  Elana     What I hate about the books/film is that supposedly this is what ""women want"". I hate that the media just paints with a broad brush like that. I hate that all my husbands friends and coworkers suggested when he asked for Valentines Day ideas that he take me to see this. Im offended that just because Im a female Im put in a bin and told what I should want. I have had plenty of ""Christian Greys"" come on to me in my single days and I hate that kind of guy. 50shades isnt every womans fantasy and it certainly isnt mine Reply February 22 2015  by  David     You are so delusional i just had to comment. Youve had plenty of under 30 year old very handsome ripped billionaires come on to you in your single days? Thats interesting because literally 0 of those exist in the world. Even if we tone it down to millionaires thered be few men who check all those boxes. The whole plot is so retarded and unrealistic i just dont understand how people actually like this. Everything from Chris Gray to the sex scenes was just completely absurd not to mention boring. Reply February 18 2015  by  Taryn     I completely agree with your review The people commenting above are not realizing the brilliance in the sarcastic humor that is featured in the film. The book had a great story idea but the characters their traits and the writing style were all stripped right from Twilight.. which also features repetitive descriptions and a klutzy-awkward girl who falls (in Anas case- literally) for a freaky self-loathing adonis. Either way the film did drag on a little longer than I would have liked. I also would never drag my boyfriend to a truly female-oriented film Obviously an educated 31-year-old male who has never read the books would have zero interest in a movie that is clearly heavily dependent on the fact that the audience knows every detail about this book so we have to make this for them. Reply February 20 2015  by  David     I havent watched the movie and dont plan to but I find strangely sexy that Christy liked it.

That makes sense (sarcasm) Reply February 22 2015  by  Kaylene     I went to seethes film with my husband mostly as a joke for entertainment. I did read the first 2 books and beginning of the 3rd. I kind of felt offended by how much societys reaction is that women will be so turned on by it. From what I read he picks out this ladies based on how closely they resemble his deceased crack addict mom so he can beat them then have sex with them.... maybe Im just odd but that does not turn me on it seems very creepy and borderline incest. I noticed during the film they left out some of the earlier painful spanking she had and also the part where he puts butt rash cream on her afterwards and they just made it seem like the sadism was very minor and extremely pleasurable for her- except for the ending. I also observe that the girl who plays Anastasia seems a little more into the sex scenes than Christian. She could have been better but its not really her fault since there was zero chemistry from the Christian-Robot and he honestly seemed like all his efforts were put into not screwing up his American accent that he couldnt put any focus into the actual acting- maybe he should stick to modeling. I liked the humor in the film but then realized it took away from the sexual chemistry that the film is supposedly about. Also at my theater did the majority of the audience burst out laughing at the end. Reply February 27 2015  by  Joe     Actually i agree its a v interesting movie. The sets were art decor-ish awesome especially his house. And the movie was well-shot. Loved the glider ride too (Ana obviously enjoyed the moneyed ride l). I think many people have this fantasy of having a dark brooding rich man falling heads over heels for her. However it will be a better film if Ana was less shallow and reject his advances (at least initially). She liked Grey because hes filthy rich. I also think shes lying that she is a virgin (you will be a fool to believe her lol). Reply February 28 2015  by  Jen     Its not based on a true story it is merely a fantasy that some will love some wont mind and some will hate similar to every other fictional story ever written. If youve read the books you become invested in the realtionship between the characters and how they evolve. The movie evolves too and this is supposed to be a review of the movie not a place to voice that this is or is not your fantasy. If you havent seen it dont write a review. Reply February 28 2015  by  blaine     Details about me first. I have a PhD and teach in a large university. The previous two movies I saw were The Imitation Game and The Theory of Everything. I mention this because I suspect people think that viewers who liked Fifty Shades must be idiots who have lousy taste. I enjoyed the movie immensely. So did some who reviewed the movie at Slate and Salon who seemed though to need to stipulate that it was lowbrow or trashy or whatever and yet despite that they LOVED it. I suspect that the legions of critics who hated the film are simply too snobbish and too worried about being seen as easily amused to admit that they might have had lots of fun seeing it if theyd been younger and less jaded. The movie is a gorgeous visual treat with beautiful locations and atmospheric moods great set designs lovely costuming and one heck of an adorable sexy and funny female lead Dakota Johnson. Personally I thought the male lead was acceptable too even if a young Mathew McConaughey might have been ideal. The sex scenes are erotic light years better than porn and the leads have relationship chemistry. Yes the concept of a young everywoman meeting a mysterious billionaire is fantasy but who does not mind a fairy tale sometimes on a friday night. Reply July 18 2016  by  Lorraine Shaw     Blaine - good review but I take exception with not getting the feel of how good Jamie Dornan was as Christian Grey......he has the most expressive face Im seen in years. I could read everything he was thinking with regards to Anastasia. I am looking forward to the sequel....... Reply March 5 2015  by  lulu rongmei     I read the book and loved it. Watched the movie and I dont think theres much to complain. Sure they downplayed the BDSM elements in the movie but really if the sex scenes in the movie were to be played exactly as written in the book then it would be no different then porn(although it was porn in print). But that subtlety in the movie was what made it sexy(and not vulgar. Big difference).And I dont get why people are complaining about dornan being stiff and all that. Well if you must know its because his character(as per the book) demands it. Christian grey is all dark and brooding and emotionally tortured in the book it would do injustice to his character if dornan were to be all charming and vibrant and friendly. Reply March 7 2015  by  Pat     I read all three books. Yes they make your eyes bleed but that did not deter me from finishing the trilogy or watching the movie. First let me state that I feel all the Jamie hate is a bit misplaced. First the writer made such an effort into making Ana a better character someone we could like that she spent absolutely no effort in developing Christians character at all. Or so it seems. Now enter into the factor that all the scenes where Christian was amused and passionate were watered down to mud. For one example take the scene where he first punishment spanks her for rolling her eyes. In the book they had just had hot sex. Anna begs him to stay -- he has one more condom she reminds him. He says no and she rolls her eyes. So he (they are in the bedroom remember -- just had sex) pulls down her sweat pants takes her over his knee and gives her a real punishment spanking. An 18 smack true punishment spanking. And she is turned on; hot I want sex right now turned on. Just as turned on as he is. And they have hot hot earth shattering sex. It is then when they are both panting breathless and post orgasmic that Christian tells Ana ""welcome to my world"". An explanation about the sweat pants for those who havent read the books which can be very confusing since they just had sex. She sleeps in those sweat pants and had just gotten dressed since he was dressing to leave. From Fifty Shades of Grey ""Oh Ana"" he cries out loudly as he finds his release holding me in place as he pours himself into me. He collapses panting hard beside me and he pulls me on top of him and buries his face in my hair holding me close. ""Oh baby"" he breathes. ""Welcome to my world."" We lie there panting together waiting for our breathing to slow."" ~~~~~~ Afterward she cant look him in the eye. He spends some time with her rubs oil on her bottom and makes sure she is okay. Which she insists she is. Once she leaves she has to deal with the humiliation that this man has just spanked her. She has to deal with the fact of how much it turned her on. When she gets the phone call from her mother (which they did feel was important enough to include) she becomes tearful. After hanging up all her emotional feelings overwhelm her and she ends up sobbing. He emails her telling her how in awe of her he is because she took the punishment spanking. She tells him shes not happy because he did not spend the night. (not because he spanked her mind). He comes back finds her sobbing and ends up spending the night just cuddling and sleeping. When she wakes up her thoughts arent about the spanking but the fact that she has had him in her bed one more night when he doesnt sleep with anyone. And the fact that this scene happens before she shows up at his house to go to the playroom the first time is very important in terms of her first playroom session their relationship and how it progresses. What did the screenwriter give us of this entire scene? You might not recognize it from the movie so Ill help out. They are in the living room talking. No sex beforehand. She rolls her eyes and he brings her across his knee and gives her 3 really mild little swats. Hes smiling. Shes smiling. No one is turned on he doesnt stay and its no big deal. In the meantime we get a very monotone lifeless ""welcome to my world"" from the Christian character. All the life the passion and the progression is taken out of the original scene. This was one of the important scenes that should have been portrayed as closely as possible to the book. All of Christians power passion and actions are watered down to something as lifeless and boring as changing your cat litter box. But how the hell is that Jamies fault? He had nothing to work with. His scenes were watered down as lifeless as the way the director obviously wanted him to portray them. And its not the only scene that was changed to the point of boredom from the screenwriter and director. As I said they worked so hard to make sure Ana had a personality and more likable that they made Christian so unbelievably boring by cutting his lines his passion his part of the story down to nothing. And to be clear Dakota (and Im not taking anything away from her) didnt write her part. She didnt make Ana likable or witty. The screenwriter did. Jamie didnt make Christian boring and lifeless the screenwriiter and director did. And both the story and chemistry suffered because of it. Even in the first scene at his office they took out much of the dialog that gave that scene life. In the book Christian was trying not to laugh at her. He was amused. He knew she wasnt Kate before Ana entered his office. From his perspective (which is given in another section of the book) this is what he was thinking ""Showtime Grey. Lets have some fun."" All the interaction that made this interview fun were simply deleted with the screenplay. In the movie at the end of the interview you cant see why either one of them would want to see the other again. And before anyone reminds me that the film was too long and every scene could not be included the point Im making is that the wrong scenes were used or changed. Instead they gave us many repetitive scenes we didnt need and left out the ones that actually told the story and gave both characters personality and depth. And yes it sounds like Im a Jamie defender. I guess in this aspect I am. But Ive seen Jamies other work. I keep hearing ""underwear model"". But hes been an actor for some time. He was fantastic in the television series ""Once Upon the Time."" In ""The Fall"" he does himself proud and brings the role of Paul Spector to life with finesse and courage. In the final episode the interaction with him and Gillian Anderson is chilling. Every little facial expression every line tells us more about this man than you can imagine. He has also done some movies. He was very good in ""Racing Hearts."" Yes Im sure he struggled with his accent since he has a very pronounced Irish accent in real life. But remember the director could have stopped filming taken Jamie aside and told him that she wasnt getting what she needed for the character. She could have done a retake until she got what she needed to make the scenes sizzle. Since she didnt I cant help but think that this is how she wanted him to play the character. Which made the scene fizzle instead. But you cant take all the passion and character out of a role and then blame the actor because thats how its played. They were so worried about making the sex scenes hot that they ended up being much too cold. There was so much choreography and edited footage that the sex scenes just werent exciting. There was very little foreplay. Really just a few kisses down her stomach? In the virgin scene in the book Christians foreplay and the way he talked her into a near orgasm before he ever touched her intimately would have made that a much hotter scene. Instead what did we get? A scene watered down to tediousness and boredom. As for the first scene I talked about I know the actors were probably uncomfortable as hell with the sex scenes but not all of them had to been showed. The one where he comes in and uses the ice could have been deleted. It really didnt do anything to push the plot along. Instead they could have used the spanking scene. The way it was told in the book was that he wanted to fk her on the hood of her new car. Then they go into the bedroom to have that first round of hot sex. Instead of showing another sex scene they could have gone from the car scene and cut away to the bedroom where it shows him getting up after the sex making the actors look a little breathless and sweaty and that would have conveyed what we needed to know without them having to strip down and actually act it out for the cameras. Then after they showed the spanking they could have done that sex scene instead of the boring ice scene. That would have been super hot after the punishment spanking (as it was in the book) That would have shown how turned on Ana was which explains more about her feelings and character when she shows up for the Red room the first time. And wouldnt a breathless panting post orgasmic Christian telling Ana ""welcome to my world"" told us a lot more about Christian Grey than the lifeless ""welcome to my world"" written by the screenwriter and given to Jamie to play? Reply March 21 2015  by  Sarah     Youre review was absolutely the best review on here. Great job I felt the same in watching the movie after reading all three books Thank you Reply March 23 2015  by  jamie     I look at it as a romance. Strictly that. She couldnt get him to love her the way she wanted. He couldnt either. But deep down at the end its jus a love story woth sex involved like any other movie. The kinky sex focus is jus a game they both lost. Jus like love. Its unique style is what make it interesting to me. Sex play a big part in relationship. But jus like a man want to have sexual relationship and nothing more. Sometimes u fall in love but usually the female cant stay for the good sex becus we are emotional. Men dnt mind....im young. Jus my view. Its all bout falling in love and being hurt in the end knowing what could have happened.

Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size Christopher Orr Feb 13 2015 Culture Has there ever been lower-hanging fruit than the cinematic adaptation of Fifty Shades of Grey? The movie has tens of millions of devoted fans set to queue up and tens of millions more wondering what all the fuss is about. And ... how to put this delicately? It couldnt possibly be as bad as the book.And indeed director Sam Taylor-Johnsons adaptation is not nearly as painful an experience as E. L. Jamess novel. The authors sub-leaden prose is gone thank goodness as is the internal monologue of her 21-going-on-14 protagonist Anastasia Steele. There are no holy shits holy cows holy craps holy fucks or holy Moseses; no boys or oh mys or jeezes. Theres no mention of Anas ""inner goddess"" let alone of it ""doing the merengue."" For this we can all be grateful. (Much of Jamess dialogue alas is rendered intact.)Related Story Bad Romance Taylor-Johnson also tones down to some degree the most troubling element of the novel. In it the sexual encounters between college student Ana and her paramour the 27-year-old billionaire tycoon and Samp;M enthusiast Christian Grey are never nonconsensual in the most literal sense. But her consent is frequently coerced as my colleague Emma Green has noted at length. Christian makes clear that he wants to explore new sexual territory. Ana makes clear that she does not. He makes clear that its his way or the highway. She relents out of fear of losing him. By cutting out Anas internal monologue Taylor-Johnson removes many of the moments in which her unhappiness with Christians sexual mistreatment is made most explicit.Thats not the only transgressive (or would-be transgressive) material thats been cut. The post-tampon sex scene is out. Anas performance of oral sex on Christian is gone as well though memory of the phrase ""my very own Christian Grey-flavored Popsicle"" will I fear remain with us forever. The Ben Wa balls do not make an appearance and the beneath-the-dinner-table groping of Ana that Christian undertakes at his parents house is presented as decidedly tame.Which leaves? Well awfully little. While Taylor-Johnsons adaptation may not be as unpleasant or offensive as it could have been it is stunningly mind-glazingly dull. This is a two-hour film containing maybe half an hours worth of anything actually happening.Theres the excruciating meet-cute in which Ana (Dakota Johnson) stumbles her way through a school-paper interview with Christian (Jamie Dornan)--literally stumbles his first sight being of her falling in through the doorway. On their next meeting he saves her from the tragic fate of being run over by a bicycle. And for their third she drunk-dials him from the bathroom of a club and he shows up just in time to have her vomit on his shoes and then pass out altogether. (Sexy) He whisks her away to his apartment shows her his Red Room of Pain and asks her to sign a lengthy contract to become his sexual ""submissive.""While she dithers on this attractive offer he meets her parents and she meets his and none of these four presumptive adults suggest even the possibility that there might be something untoward about a hard-charging global CEO romancing a virginal college student. He takes her up in a helicopter. He takes her up in a glider. He gives her a room in his apartment. He plays Chopin on the piano in order to convey the sensitive soul beneath his cool cruel veneer. He buys her a three-volume first edition of Tess of the dUrbervilles. He buys her a laptop. He buys her a car. His chauffeur buys her some vomit-free clothing.They have between 10 and 20 variations on the following conversationAna Why do you want to spank/whip/tie me up? Why cant we be an ordinary couple?Christian Because this is what I am.And of course they have sex. Theoretically it is portrayed as ""kinky"" sex though as noted the kinkier bits of the book have mostly been cut and none of them were all that kinky to begin with. So Christian ties Ana up with a necktie with leather shackles with rope. He tickles her with an ice cube. He tickles her with an ostrich feather. He spanks her gently with his hand. He swats her lightly with a crop and later with a ""flogger."" Though there is discussion of vibrators dildos and butt plugs none of these items are ever in evidence let alone in use. With the exception of the movies climax (no not that the narrative kind) pretty much nothing takes place that would scandalize your parents and perhaps your parentss parents. This is a movie that features less frontal nudity than Forgetting Sarah Marshall.In addition to erasing pain from the Ana-Christian equation Taylor-Johnson has largely erased pleasure.It has been widely rumored that the movies stars Johnson and Dornan actively dislike one another and both have said in interviews that they were very uncomfortable when filming the movies sex scenes. I am sorry to say that neither is a persuasive enough performer to give any impression otherwise. The sex scenes begin gently and conclude pneumatically but they offer vanishingly little in the way of heat or life or joy or daring. They are if anything less risque than such long-ago R-rated staples as 9 1/2 Weeks or Fatal Attraction. In addition to erasing pain from the Ana-Christian equation Taylor-Johnson has largely erased pleasure. The stultifying sameness of the sex sequences is such that I suspect one could shuffle them around without anyone noticing.During the non-sexual scenes Johnson occasionally displays real ease and finesse onscreen. Unfortunately shes clearly been saddled with a directive to convey her characters burgeoning sensuality through a near-constant oral fixation. Its been said that the movie contains 20 minutes of sex; if this is the case it must contain at least 40 minutes of Ana biting her lip or putting a pencil in her mouth.Dornan however fares far worse. In part this is a problem of page-to-screen translation In the book Christian is seen only through Anas eyes as a kind of divine distillation of masculine charisma a six-foot Y chromosome in a tailored suit. As such the role would be a tough challenge for any actor. (Its a shame though that American Psycho-era Christian Bale was not available to give it a try.) But Dornan despite his exemplary turn in The Fall is utterly lacking in the fierce intensity this role requires. It doesnt help that the Irish actor can manage only an intermittent approximation of an American accent. His native brogue is evident in the very first scene and try as he might to choke it down it keeps coming back up like an elocutionary hairball.As for Taylor-Johnson she is a respected artist and its hard to know what she (with screenwriter Kelly Marcel) might have made of the movie if left to her own devices. What we do know is that she was not so left By all accounts she dealt with near-constant interference from James. The author was given uncommon creative control when she sold the book rights and she weighed in heavily--and according to most reports unhelpfully--on every aspect of the production from costume to set design to dialogue with an explicit personal mandate of ""protecting"" the experience of the books fans. The final line of the movie was a particular bone of contention between the two with James unfortunately prevailing. It is perhaps a fitting irony that this should be the fate of the movie version of Fifty Shades of Grey contractually enslaved to an unrelenting control freak.

Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

"Fifty Shades of Grey | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; fifty-shades-of-grey ) Fifty Shades of Grey (United States 2015) February 13 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli Who would have imagined that a movie about sex could be so boring? Thats the bottom line when it comes to Fifty Shades of Grey although Im perfectly willing to admit that this could be one of those films where the ""Men are from Mars Women are from Venus"" effect comes into play. After all this movie is effectively a visual representation of one of the most common female fantasies (the so-called ""rape fantasy""). Seen from that perspective one can perhaps defend Fifty Shades of Grey as something more than an overlong repetitive unsatisfying drama about a physically and emotionally abusive love affair. For most movies a one or two sentence synopsis does a disservice - not so for Fifty Shades of Grey which is so plot-deficient that its essence can be captured easily in a 140-character tweet Shy college girl meets kinky rich dude who attempts to manipulate her into becoming a submissive to his dominant. Thats pretty much the entirety of what Fifty Shades of Grey has to offer. Its window into the world of BDSM (Bondage amp; Discipline Dominance amp; Submission Sadism amp; Masochism) is idealized but theres a disturbing aspect to this fantasy. When the participants in a BDSM relationship are well-matched (a dom and a sub) it can be rewarding for both. However when one is a narcissist control freak and the other is merely looking for a ""normal"" relationship things can turn physically and emotionally abusive - which is precisely what happens in Fifty Shades of Grey. The interaction between sweet Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) and cold Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) isnt kinky; its twisted. This is a warped relationship from the start but the filmmakers seem blithely unaware of the dark territory into which they have stumbled and insist this is healthy erotica. Its supposedly about Anastasias development as a person but the movie steers clear of examining the psychological damage being done to her along the way. It reminds me of General Hospital in the late 1970s/early 1980s when Lukes rape of Laura became referred to as a ""mutual seduction."" Its no secret that Fifty Shades of Grey achieved its notoriety because of its supposedly-steamy sex scenes and although they have been tamed and shortened in the film to avoid the dreaded NC-17 they remain in the forefront (at least following a generic ""meet cute"" 45-minute lead-up). We see all of Dakota Johnson and most of Jamie Dornan but director Sam Taylor-Johnsons approach is sterile and clinical. Theres nothing arousing about Johnson and Dornans clothes-free acrobatics. Chemistry might be an overrated term but theres no heat or combustibility evident here. The chilliness between the actors speaks less of obsession adoration or love than it does of indifference. During a bathtub scene when Johnson reclines against Dornan theres a palpable sense of discomfort - as if neither of them wants to be there. (Watch their expressions.) Its off-putting and breaks the fantasy almost as thoroughly as recognizing what Fifty Shades of Grey is actually selling. Johnson has difficulty grasping the essential characteristics of Anastasia from the beginning overplaying her mousiness to a degree thats almost embarrassing. Dornan gives us a stony domineering self-obsessed Christian - a monster not far removed from Patrick Bateman in Bret Easton Ellis American Psycho (memorably played on film by Christian Bale). Im not sure if this is an accurate reflection of the character in E.L. James novel but it emphasizes how unhealthy - bordering on toxic - the films central romance is. Fifty Shades of Grey ends on an unsettled note that rather than closing the book on the ugliness of Christian and Anas tryst promises more angst manipulation and emotional power struggles in future episodes. Apparently even low-brow material like this cant tell an entire story in a two-hour time slot. Sequels are fine but is it too much to ask for a film to work on its own without requiring the viewer to see the other installments? Fifty Shades of Grey ends up coming across as a curdled setup for additional financially-motivated productions that hopefully will show more respect to the characters and the audience than this one does.

"F- - - in Problems For a Good Time Do Not Call Fifty Shades of Grey << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com F- - - in Problems For a Good Time Do Not Call Fifty Shades of Grey Chuck Zlotnick/Universal Pictures Movies February 13 2015 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print ""Do you trust me?"" asks Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) the titular billionaire bore in Fifty Shades of Grey after hes twice made love to Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) the college senior who shows up in his Seattle skyscraper for a newspaper interview and eventually stays for a spanking. Should we trust this guy? By this point he has shown her his Samp;M parlor liberated her from virginity and celebrated by sitting alone at his piano and playing Beethoven. This is the 16th woman to be offered an exclusive to his penis and apparently the first to find the contract that comes with it a little fishy. (Her ""What do I get out of this?"" Him ""Me."") The contract isnt all thats binding. Anastasia is baby-stepped into Christians private world of treating bondage and pain as pleasure. What danger there is in this scenario feels accidental. Dornan is an Irishman and former fashion model who comports himself here with the kind of stiff American masculinity that presumably is meant to connote arousal. Christians chest is dotted with burns and youre in constant suspicion that theyve been caused by faulty circuitry beneath his skin. When he drops in on Anastasia at the hardware store where she works looking for cable ties its not wrong to presume theyre for his own wiring. Christian is a sex machine all right -- if that machine also happens to be the Terminator. Fifty Shades of Grey is based on the first book in a 2012 trilogy by E.L. James that hoped to connect old-fashioned romance and point-blank eroticism Sense and Fuckability. The series began as self-published fan fiction based on the Twilight vampire books which pitted lust against chastity. Fan fiction tends to double as an ardently wishful critique of its source material. Here the wish was for the sex to happen much sooner and last way longer -- and what if the vampire happened to be a young businessman raised by a family friend to be a domineering lover? (Everlasting kinkiness is the equivalent of the vampire curse.) Any movie based on Jamess books holds an advantage over the Twilight films since it doesnt need to involve the onslaught of computer-generated sequences and world-building nonsense and invented jargon. Fifty Shades is ultimately just a girl a guy and his riding crop and that should be enough. But its not. In another life James worked as a television executive. The episodic pacing and zinging dialogue of her books is better suited for TV where most of the best life-size adventures now take place. Instead theres a galling presumption that running for two hours confers movie-ness upon it. The film doesnt culminate in anything. Its a bunch of scenes that end before any kind of satisfying conclusion. The fifty shades might be grey but your balls are also blue.  The adaptation credited to Kelly Marcel empties itself of the books sublime ridiculousness. For instance Christian still takes Anastasia up in a glider but omits the novels soft-core quasi-feminist camp of encouraging her to take the joystick. ""Go on Anastasia. Grab it he urges more vehemently"" writes James in the book. ""Oh shit. Hes going to make me fly the plane. No"" Its diet Erica Jong Fear of Gliding. ""Come. He holds out his hand for me"" James writes ""and I clamber out of the cockpit."" In the movie theres no mention of the planes joystick which means Anastasia has no opportunity to put her hands on it. As a book Fifty Shades of Grey doesnt go on long enough to be a chore. Unlike Stephenie Meyers Twilight books theres no torture in the breathless writing. The prose is purple the way a plum is not the way a face is from lack of air. Fifty Shades can be appreciated simultaneously as romantic fantasy and a mockery of it with very little need to distinguish between the two. Its simple but theres psychology lurking in its simplicity. This isnt to say that James in this first book explores psychology. Shes rather reckless with it but the recklessness is absurdly readable. Both of her characters come from broken yet stable homes. Anastasia has seen a revolving door of stepfathers. Christian is an orphan whose adoptive mother is a renowned doctor. Anastasia doesnt like to be tied up and whipped. Christian claims he doesnt like her lovingly touching him. Both are forms of bondage. In the books fantasy Christians perverse damage needs true love to be healed (not it appears a shrink) and Anastasia is the woman who can bestow it upon him curing him of his sexually deviant nature. (This by the way is what you get when the premise of your series is somebody elses series that was based on vampires werewolves and horny teenage girls.) A movie studio would be foolish not to adapt any book that sat atop the best-seller lists for two years. Its success is foreordained. But a movie made from these books demands shamelessness. It needs Anastasias hand on the joystick. Instead this one goes for something moral clean and almost tediously straight-faced. Its true that were spared the werewolf-vampire gobbledygook -- there are no Volturi to speak of. But it must also be said that there are no Volturi to speak of. There really is no movie. There are sex scenes here and there. The director Sam Taylor-Johnson does everything she can to make them tasteful and fair like shes selling body spray or panties. Johnson goes topless. Dornan reveals a patch of pubic hair and makes a lot of his moves in sweatpants and jeans. The soundtrack is obvious ""I Put a Spell on You"" ""Beast of Burden"" ""Im on Fire."" The bedroom scenes are polite appetizers for what Christian presumably hopes will be many evenings in his playroom. The plot chiefly orbits around the sex contract Christian has drawn up for Anastasia. It enumerates the ways in which she (the submissive) will obey him (the dominant). He will punish her and she will like it. The hook of Jamess book is Anastasias casual and exclamatory narration in which she mentions Christian slipping into and pulling out of her the talk of condoms and erections and oh. Mercifully she doesnt narrate the movie but in losing her point of view the movie loses the novels sense of ecstasy. Episodes of Friends have been more explicit. To that end its far closer to your average romantic comedy than to a sex drama between a punisher and the punished. Christian keeps buying Anastasia stuff -- a new computer a new car a very old first edition of Thomas Hardys tragedy Tess of the dUrbervilles. He makes surprise appearances at events where he monitors her alcohol intake (""another margarita"" he texts once in judgment). Possible Terminator. Definite personal trainer. What obviously comes to mind is Pretty Woman in which Richard Geres antisocial businessman decides to make Julia Robertss prostitute The One. Fifty Shades of Grey takes 125 minutes to do what that movie did in its first dozen or so scenes. It could use some of Geres seasoning. Dornan is fine -- hes willingly opaque keeping the movie shallow by being hot and passive-aggressively available. These are the characters as James wrote them and I can imagine the riots if a Richard Gere were to class up the joint with his emotional firewall. But with onscreen Samp;M you need to believe in the doms dominance. Dornan is part of the way there. He looks like a guy youd see in his own world at the gym or at a table in an expensive restaurant -- a mystery. But the movie needs him to be boyish. I suppose thats a crucial element of the fantasy -- that despite his alleged damage Christian is hot and nice that he isnt dangerous just robotically perfect. The best scene in the movie is the one that seems the most like it could have been in Pretty Woman. Anastasia calls a business meeting to go over the contract and strikes anal and vaginal fisting from the appendix on Page 5. Johnsons firmness in this exchange wakes you up. The movie is letting her play situational comedy instead of vacuous good-girl quirks. Those were all she was left with on Foxs defunct sitcom Ben and Kate in which she charmed you into liking a human jellyfish. Johnsons mealy girlish delivery doesnt evoke Julia Roberts so much as Johnsons own mother Melanie Griffith. Griffith boarded the express train to a sort of movie stardom with a contract-negotiation scene in the most cockamamie of Brian De Palmas cubist Hitchcock tributes 1984s Body Double. Griffith plays Holly Body a platinum blonde porn actress propositioned by the wallowing actor shes just done a scene with. Hes pretending to be an adult-film producer who wants to hire her and Holly lays out her terms ""I do not do animal acts. I do not do Samp;M or any variations of that particular bent. No water sports either. I will not shave my pussy. No fist fucking. And absolutely no coming in my face. I get 2000 a day and I do not work without a contract."" Griffith is the daughter of Tippi Hedren. Presumably De Palma hired Griffith for the opportunity to make explicit the sexual trauma and suppression in Hedrens appearances in Hitchcocks The Birds and Marnie. This is all to say that Johnson hails from complex erotic stock (her father is the randy TV star and recording artist Don Johnson) of which Fifty Shades of Grey only scratches the surface. Whats nice about the negotiation scene is how much Johnson evokes Griffith creating her own angles in Working Girl in which Griffiths screwball-dingbat delivery belied great reserves of self-confidence. No matter how much nudity -- or near nudity -- the movies wanted of her and even when she was miscast (which she always seemed to be) that confidence remained the source of her sexiness. She was post-Born Yesterday Judy Holliday.1 In any case it would be a relief to see Johnson too get something more declarative to do.  Anastasia is not only submissive in this movie shes also clueless. ""What are butt plugs?"" she asks. Dornan could have answered ""Have you seen The Story of O.?"" Anyone whos old enough to remember the old fear and hysteria caused by Samp;M movies like Luis Bunuels Belle du Jour and Tim Blake Nelsons O and Adrian Lynes Nine 1/2 Weeks; or anyone whos seen Bernardo Bertoluccis Last Tango in Paris Michael Hanekes The Piano Teacher and the trashily vicious Color of Night; or anyone whos watched Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader in the imperfectly exciting Secretary or watched Girlss audacious second season or any year of Sex and the City is likely to leave Fifty Shades of Grey perplexed by its uncontroversial mildness. Whats the big deal? The phenomenon of the book and now the movie is to Samp;M what Madonna was to vogueing -- a catchy legitimization. Having somebody like Lyne direct these movies would obviously distort the nature of whose fantasy this is. But at least then hed be giving you something whose adult-male impulses entertained even as they appalled. It feels as if Taylor-Johnson is consciously pushing back against men like Lyne who made Fatal Attraction and Indecent Proposal and Unfaithful. But in pushing back it also feels like shes pushing down like shes suppressing. In the film Christians issues with sex arent treated like a problem at all until they are -- and the film falls into a visual trap of frivolity from which it cant fully escape. Watching Christian whip a weeping Anastasia my mind drifted to Michael Fassbender having Chiwetel Ejiofor do the same to Lupita Nyongo in 12 Years a Slave. In Fifty Shades the prevailing lightness toward the abuse in that moment is shocking even as it sets up the drama for installment two. The movie seems scared of itself. Look at Anastasias back. There are no scars. Griffith starring in a 1993 remake with Don Johnson and John Goodman was redundant. Filed Under Movies Jamie Dornan Dakota Johnson Fifty Shades of Grey E.L.

More like fifty shades of beige Add to ... Courtney Shea Special to The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Feb. 12 2015 1259PM EST Last updated Thursday Feb. 12 2015 424PM EST Comments AA Directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson Written by Kelly Marcel Starring Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan Classification 18A Year 2015 Country USA Language English Putting aside the actual movie for a moment the team that brought Fifty Shades of Grey to the screen knows a lot about foreplay. From the moment it was announced that E.L. Jamess erotica-for-housewives sensation would be made into a movie excitement has been building every casting decision met with moans every preview picked over like a Playboy in a prison washroom which is - of course - the trouble with excessive anticipation both in sex and in cinema Get too worked up beforehand and the main event rarely measures up. Not that the Fifty Shades of Grey movie was ever going to be a masterpiece. Will this or wont this be an Oscar contender is not a question people will ask themselves as they slink into the theatre hoping to avoid colleagues and relatives and anyone else with whom future eye contact could be required.In light of this reality a traditional evaluation seems pointless and so to borrow a phrase from back before Dakota Johnson was even a twinkle in Don Johnsons linen pants - lets not and say we did. Instead here are five questions for Fifty Shades fans (and everyone else who is secretly dying to see this movie).1. Should you go see Fifty Shades with your significant other on V-Day?A pressing matter since Hallmarks favourite holiday is almost upon us and since many couples will consider seeing Fifty Shades as a form of Valentines Viagra. Will it work? Possibly. The very act of seeing an ""erotic film"" with your significant other may be enough to spark that sex drive and even if your libidos arent tickled your funny bones will be. This isnt a jab since the screenwriter (Kelly Marcel Saving Mr. Banks) and the cast embrace the campiness of the source material delivering lines like ""if you were mine you wouldnt sit for a week"" with just the right amount of wink-wink. The first two-thirds of the movie are fun and stylish and its entertaining to watch the classic boy-meets-girl setup interlace with the more adult aspects of this particular story (boy meets girl girl falls for boy boy asks girl to sign a 50-page sex contract). The last 20 minutes drag on leaving ample time to make out in the back row.2. How hot is the sex and how much sex is there?Not enough and definitely not enough. While book readers could flip straight to the good bits theater-goers must sit through scene after scene of snoozy phallic imagery Christian Grey driving a sports car commandeering a helicopter piloting a glider plane. Even when he and Anastasia do get kinky in the ""playroom"" the action is strangely sterile Nobody sweats or pants or experiences onscreen ecstasy which is presumably how a movie about violent sex manages to avoid an NC-17 rating but the result feels like 50 shades of beige.3. How are Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson?Both are relative newcomers on the Hollywood film circuit though he is from the amazing BBC series The Fall and she is from the amazing genetic mash-up of Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith. When the co-stars first appeared publicly together at the Golden Globe Awards in January all the talk was around their lack of sizzle a criticism that turned out to be half right As the titular anti-hero Dornan is stiff and as unappealing as a preposterously good-looking half-clad man could possibly be. Johnson however has sparkle and ""it"" factor enough for two. In her surprisingly deft hands dialogue is funny and even sharp. Her performance is by far the biggest reason to recommend this movie - just as Julianne Moore recently made light of her beginnings on Days of Our Lives Dakota Johnson may some day joke about her humble beginnings as the girl with a ball gag in her mouth.4. Is it as good as the book?Do people really think the book is good or is it more a case of how much they enjoyed it? Having never read it I can only say how much my movie viewing experience was enhanced by the occasional ""in the book - blah blah blah"" insight. For example The movie has a scene where Anastasia dines with Christians family and he gropes at her thigh under the table. ""In the book she is wearing anal beads through this entire scene"" my friend informed me. So no to come back to the question above - its not.5. Bad-bad or so-bad-its-good?Much was made about how with respectable director Sam Taylor-Johnson at the helm Fifty Shades was going to be a legitimately good movie. Its not and its also not over-the-top enough to suggest future cult-classic status. What it is is a movie best saved for at home viewing both because there is no compelling reason to see it on the big screen and mostly because the pause rewind and fast-forward controls are sure to come in handy.Special to The Globe and Mail Report Typo/Error Follow us on Twitter GlobeArts More Related to this Story Meet the new Christian Grey Fifty Shades of Grey lead is recast Fifty Shades of Grey becomes subject of university course Fans arent very happy with the Fifty Shades of Grey casting decision Comments AA In the know Life This woman became a middle-age man magnet.

The other 49 shades promised in the title are missing from the movie version of the infamous novel. Regardless of whether or not you have read E.L. James mommy porn bestseller -- or its two sequels -- the movie commits a cardinal sin. And it has nothing to do with the restrained and awkward portrayal of BDSM sexuality on the screen. The situation is far worse. Fifty Shades of Grey is a mind-numbing soul-destroying excruciating bore. It helps not at all that there is zero sexual and/or romantic chemistry between the two leads Dakota Johnson (the 25-year-old daughter of American movie actors Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson) and Jamie Dornan (a Belfast-born Irish actor model and musician). Johnson is actually quite appealing as the virginal and awkward Anastasia Steele the young university student who falls in love with uber-rich Seattle entrepreneur Christian Grey only to discover that he rejects romance and prefers to negotiate a BDSM relationship with him as the dominant and her as the submissive. The camera loves Johnson -- especially her liquid eyes -- and she shows more acting chops than either of her famous parents. But Dornan (who replaced Charlie Hunnam after the Englishman dropped out) only looks great Otherwise he is zombie-like in trying to make sense of his shallow and petulant character. In the movie Christian Grey is incapable of explaining away his fetishes and just comes across as a creepy jealous and selfish stalker. Mobile users please click here. As a result Fifty Shades of Grey offers nothing of interest for BDSM practitioners for romantics in general or for women who have gobbled up the James books (which were written by Briton Erika Mitchell under a pseudonym originally as Twilight fan fiction). The sexual scenes are not just a long time in arriving in the movie they are absurdly tame. The director of this Anglo-American travesty British filmmaker Sam Taylor-Johnson claims to have been inspired by classic sexualized films such as Last Tango in Paris. But there is not even a glimmer of the dangerous carnal excitement that Bernardo Bertoluccis film generated -- 43 years ago As for more recent mainstream films that explore the outer limits Danish director Lars von Triers ridiculous Nymphomaniac at least showed the sex including BDSM scenes that it purported to be interested in on an intellectual level. As for sensuality the French-made Blue is the Warmest Color reminds us just how sterile and mechanical Fifty Shades of Grey really is in claiming any relevance in the arena of human sexuality. Instead Fifty Shades becomes an unintentional comedy. Some of the hackneyed lines of dialogue -- perhaps reflecting the bad writing in the novels -- are so silly that audience members laughed out loud during the preview screening. There were also guffaws when Taylor-Johnson showed us Greys ultra modern office space and apartment -- and then his medieval red room of pain where his bondage devices are as well organized as his grey business suits. As for what you actually see Johnson and Dornan are both totally naked in some scenes but there is no full frontal at any time. Spanking and flogging are both depicted but not in any sensual or even sensible fashion. The procedures of BDSM are discussed but are neither shown nor explained properly. That leaves us with the murky sexual politics of Fifty Shades of Grey. But the movie is such a bore that it crushes any desire to debate whether the Steele-Grey story is evil incarnate total porn freedom for women or some slick and superficial variation on what people are already thinking about all day long.

"Fifty Shades of Grey movie reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Fifty Shades Sure Never Overthinks Things So Ill Try Not to Overthink It Fifty Shades Sure Never Overthinks Things So Ill Try Not to Overthink It Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Feb. 12 2015 756 PM Sweet Whispered Safe Words Oh my God ladies are you dying over Fifty Shades of Grey? By Meghan Daum Moan. Still from Fifty Shades of Grey (Courtesy of Universal Pictures) After youve seen Fifty Shades of Grey come back and listen to Amanda Hess Dan Kois and Dana Stevens discuss the film in Slates Spoiler Special If you come to Fifty Shades of Grey looking for true kink you will have come to the wrong place. Youll get peacock feathers and satiny blindfolds horsehair whips better for tickling than flogging and of course many expensive silk ties. The Fifty Shades phenomenon (and that would include the three novels in E.L. Jamess trilogy plus this film and its already-in-the-works sequels) may have courted controversy for its exploration of a dom-sub relationship but Story of O (or even Secretary for that matter) this is not. If anything Fifty Shades of Grey is a generic romance cynically engineered to appeal to the lowest common denominator of female fantasy. A virginal college student named Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) whose mousy bookishness belies her bodice-ripping name (she goes by Ana) finds herself drawn to Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) a young billionaire whom she interviews for her school newspaper. Christian is ravenously attracted to her too though his sexual proclivities are such that not only doesnt he ""do the girlfriend thing"" he also doesnt have sex unless it involves the whispering of sweet safe words. Advertisement But this time things are different. Christian is so taken with Ana that he deflowers her with ""vanilla sex"" something hes never had in his life--therefore kind of making him a virgin too. He even tolerates--possibly enjoys--the post-coital pancakes she whips up in the morning. There as the sun bathes the steely kitchen in flattering hopeful light the tableau of every womans fondest dream is realized a romantic night with a sexy if possibly demented stranger followed by a Maxwell House commercial. Its a class-A fantasy. Hes trouble but shes special enough to change him an end she achieves largely via the kind of coy rebuffing techniques championed by books like The Rules. He may be buying her expensive gifts (a computer an Audi a first-edition copy of Tess of the DUrbervilles) flying her around in his helicopter and showing up stalkerishly-cum-telepathically when shes trying to go about her normal life but shes savvy enough to feign indifference. Jamie Dornan has one of those faces that makes you think you might have face blindness. Johnson does the best she can with a script that sends her character lurching between doormat and sassy back-talker. She tempers Anas raw vulnerability with enough dignity that we have to admire the gamesmanship she brings to playing hard to get. Shes good at it and the rewards are greater than any helicopter ride. Christian is soon driven so crazy by Ana that he starts to do real boyfriend things. He visits her at her scrappy student apartment. He meets her stepdad at her graduation. He dances with her in his living room to Frank Sinatra. Eventually he even introduces her to his parents who have never once met any woman hes been involved with. Oh my God ladies are you dying? Advertisement Fifty Shades of Grey feels in many ways like a steroid-infused production of The Bachelor. Not so much wooden as cardboard Christian is less a fully (or even partially) realized character than a symbol of the kind of generic wholly unimaginative interpretation of ""extreme wealth"" we tend to see on reality television. Dornan has one of those faces that makes you think you might have face blindness. Every time he appears in a scene theres a split second of wondering if its him or someone else. Needless to say that doesnt bode well for presence in the boudoir. (Though swap Dornan out for Max Martini who plays his quietly charismatic driver and you might have something.) There are if you will three shades of pornography in Fifty Shades of Grey. The first and dullest consists of the sex scenes themselves which are essentially a series of music videos depicting strategically lit mildly transgressive erotic adventures accompanied by the plangent wails of Beyonce and Jessie Ware. (The soundtrack pretty much steals the film.) The second is the movies hot naked display of wealth. Christians nebulous business enterprise Grey Industries is conspicuously headquartered Flynt Publications-style in a sleek office tower called Grey House. His apartment in the luxury Seattle high-rise Escala is all travertine floors and twinkling cityscape views. He owns innumerable suits and several Audis. He parks his Eurocopter right on the roof. (In the inevitable South Park spoof hell overshoot the landing pad and impale the vessel on the Space Needle.) Depending on your taste in vehicles and home decor all this might be worth the ticket price. Ultimately though whats smuttiest about the movie is the way Christians ""dominance"" involves fewer direct orders than emo pandering. He may be a slave master but his commands often suggest hes been secretly reading Our Bodies Ourselves. ""You have a beautiful body"" he barks. ""I want you unashamed of your nakedness. Do you understand?"" Advertisement Even the infamous ""contract"" a lengthy agreement drawn up by Christian outlining what Ana will and will not do as a submissive proves so negotiable and prone to deal-sweeteners that its almost a piece of erotica unto itself. After Ana takes certain (not necessarily comfortable though not necessarily all that exotic either) sex acts off the table Christian offers to throw in a once-a-week ""real date"" like ""regular people."" To see the look on her face youd think he just slid a diamond tennis bracelet across the table. Or a small Audi. In this age of affirmative-consent laws and widespread debate about the definition of rape and sexual violence theres something odd--or maybe oddly perfect--about a dangerous deviant lothario who says things like ""Im not going to touch you not until I have your written consent."" No doubt right now there are untold numbers of gender studies majors writing papers about how all sex is transactional and the dom-sub dynamic explored in Fifty Shades simply places the inherent inequities of any physically intimate interaction in high relief. But that would be overthinking things. And since neither the film nor the book upon which its based go to any such trouble its probably best to evaluate both on their own terms. To that end Fifty Shades of Grey is a movie about Audis marble floors and Tess of the DUrbervilles. And if you see only one film this year about Audis marble floors and Tess of the DUrbervilles you could do a lot worse than this one.

By Peter Rainer Film critic February 12 2015 Save for later Saved Fifty Shades of Grey stars Dakota Johnson (l.) and Jamie Dornan (r.). Chuck Zlotnik/Universal Pictures and Focus Features/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of I suspect that the many millions of readers of ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" will find the movie adaptation not equal to the film they imagined while pantingly devouring the tome. Essentially a Harlequin Romance with pulleys E.L. Jamess novel is not exactly ""Lady Chatterleys Lover"" but the movie directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson and written by Kelly Marcel (whose previous screen credit was ""Saving Mr. Banks"") takes itself so seriously that it almost cries out to be lampooned. Im sure the ""Saturday Night Live"" crew is already on the case.Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson the daughter of Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson) is a mousy virginal college English major who ends up ensnared by brash Seattle billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan). She becomes the submissive to his dominant in his playroom aerie equipped with enough cable and rope ties to stock a hardware store. (Just in case we missed the connection we see him buying cables and rope ties at the hardware store where she works before things get heavy.) Recommended Famous movie lines How well do you know them? Anastasia doesnt really know what to make of this guy and neither do we. Although hes supposed to be strictly business - he wont even sleep in the same bed with her during her stayovers - hes really not such a bad sort. Test your knowledge Famous movie lines How well do you know them? Monitor Movie Guide He was an abused orphan you see and he had a submissive relationship with an older woman when he was younger etc. etc. This attempt to give Christian some soulfulness falls flat since Dornan has all the charisma of a hologram. Johnson is rather sweet though and if she played a role that required her to look more than alternately smitten and poleaxed she could score big. But now that ""Fifty Shades"" is poised to be a franchise will she have that chance?

By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 457pm on Thursday Feb. 19 2015 Thursday Feb. 19 2015 Thursday Feb. 12 2015 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram So much Internet ink has been spilled over Fifty Shades of Grey -- first because of the BDSM content of E.L. James steamy 2011 bestseller and then over who would star in the film -- that no matter what director Sam Taylor-Johnson and screenwriter Kelly Marcel concocted it would be a disappointment. There was no way any mainstream film could portray the books shock-around-the-clock sexuality or that any actors could sustain all of the wish-fulfillment fantasies of the storys most ardent fans.Still even with those obstacles Fifty Shades of Grey needs to have characters who connect with each other and with whom an audience can connect even if it cant duplicate the books exact appeal. And thats where the movie falls down. The easily titillated may come for the biology but what Fifty Shades lacks is chemistry.Dakota Johnson ( Need for Speed The Social Network) is Anastasia Steele a young woman who -- despite bearing the name of a soap-opera villain -- is a shy slightly nervous English Lit major. Shes especially bumbling around 27-year-old Seattle telecom millionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan The Fall) whom shes interviewing in advance of his commencement speech at her Portland college. They ""meet cute"" when she literally tumbles into his office.But Grey -- the kind of man who has a fleet of icy leggy assistants who look as if theyre straight from an 80s Robert Palmer video -- is attracted to her and she thinks hes kind of easy on the eyes too. Faster than you can say ""Hey you want me to do what?"" hes introducing her to his secret world of dominance and submission. He even has an entire room dubbed the playroom filled with what to the casual eye look like instruments of torture.The movies best moments come early as Anastasia slowly becomes aware of what shes getting into. Johnson is good at conveying the subtle giddy energy of initial attraction and then the bewilderment that sets in as she realizes that the man she is fantasizing a life with -- who is actually kind of creepy and stalkerlike -- may be beyond her understanding.Theres a very funny scene where once she verbally agrees to get involved they hash out a written contract about which of his sexual whims she will or will not satisfy. While she may be signing up to be a submissive Anastasia seems to be coming into her own and finding her voice.But the (intentional) humor evaporates about halfway through Greys 125-minute running time. From there it becomes a plodding roundelay of soft-core increasingly slap-happy sex and flat dialogue much of it revolving around him not being able to commit or love because hes really one seriously damaged dude.Yet the films biggest problem is its two stars. Despite all the ripped abs and exposed breasts blindfolds and cuffs there are few sparks between them. Without that Fifty Shades of Grey feels as cold and sterile as Greys sleek penthouse.No doubt just as with the book much will be written and argued about the movies sexual politics why women in particular seem to be drawn to its themes its portrayal of those involved in BDSM what type of box-office juggernaut its going to be (its the first of a trilogy) and its excellent soundtrack (Annie Lennoxs I Put a Spell on You is magic). It will be reviled in some quarters (the Archbishop of Cincinnati is calling for a boycott) and celebrated in others.All that is well and good but its worst sin is that its boring. Thats more painful than all of the toys in Greys playroom put together.Cary Darling 817 390-7571Twitter carydar Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

What should I do? Wait for them to report back? JOY TIPPING/STAFF WRITER Staff Writer Published 12 February 2015 0258 PM Updated 12 February 2015 1020 PM Related Ballyhooed bondage film Fifty Shades of Grey is more tedious than tawdry (C-) 50 shades of inappropriate Middle-school kids given naughty puzzles OK Ill admit it I didnt find Fifty Shades of Grey nearly as boring as my colleague Chris Vognar did (see his hilarious review here). But perhaps thats because I was so heavily as a sometime book critic comparing it to its source material. The movie is AT LEAST 1000 times better than the book which offended me in so many ways none of them regarding the sex all of them regarding author - and just calling her that makes me grit my teeth a little - E.L. James flagrant disrespect of the English language plot narrative arc all the things that supposedly comprise a novel.The movie soars above the book in three primary ways1) Its shorter. WAY shorter. Admittedly I thoroughly read only about the first 50 pages and last 20 of the book then skimmed/speed-read the rest. Thats the only way I could stomach my way through. Even that was an hour-and-a-half of my time that I sorely resent giving up to such ineptitude. I did it only because it was a popular phenomenon in book form and I do feel a responsibility to keep up on such. It hurt mentally way worse than anything Christian does to Anastasia. The movie at two hours and two minutes comparatively flies by. Like Vognar I did find myself checking my watch a time or two but I wasnt in actual emotional pain unlike what I experienced reading that tripe in book form.2) The book told as it is from Anastasias point of view lets us in FAR TOO FREQUENTLY on her inner thoughts and conflicted nature. Honestly I just wanted to slap the girl and say ""If youre really SO conflicted about this just tell the man no until you figure it out."" By going along with his bondage games while she ""makes up her mind"" about signing his ""submissive contract"" Anastasia gives consent. You may not like it but thats the fact. In both the book and the movie Christian (Jamie Dornan) makes it crystal clear on more than one occasion that the minute she says ""no"" its all over. She doesnt and in fact she enjoys herself immensely. We read her thoughts in the book and believe me shes having a good time conflicted or not. In the movie Dakota Johnson (the best thing to come out of any iteration of Fifty Shades) shows through her face and body thats shes really really into it. She may be crying at one point but the whole point of BDSM is that for some people pain brings pleasure and Im not going to argue with consenting adults.Which brings me to another point something thats been bothering me a lot in the lead-up to the movies release with every publication under the sun it seems giving space to those who decry the book and films ""concessions to rape culture."" I call BS on that right now. This is not a story about rape. There is NO rape in Fifty Shades of Grey book or movie. You may not approve of the whole domination-submission thing or kinky sex in general but ""kinky"" does not equal ""rape.""I find this rape-culture comparison disingenuous - well no actually I find it downright hypocritical. With every rape story that comes out we implore men not to think they can read womens minds. ""No"" means ""no."" Not ""Yes Im just drunk enough to like it anyway or ""Im so drunk I cant even speak so that must mean yes"" or ""Well no but I did flirt slightly with you so I must really mean yes"" or ""No but I was wearing a short skirt but I must mean yes."" Its simple No means no. And ""unconscious"" means ""cant consent."" This is what we want men to understand Dont try read our minds; listen to what we SAY.So if ""no means no"" cant ""yes mean yes""? Why are we  expecting Christian Grey to read Anastasias mind into a ""no"" when shes absolutely saying yes? OK shes a virgin when their relationship starts and yes shes a little naive for her age and yes shes a little shy. But shes an adult woman who certainly knows her wants and needs (see the ""contract negotiation"" scene to understand that). Give her credit for being an adult woman in charge of her own sexuality. She gives Christian every indication that shes willing in every encounter. She holds her hands out to be tied up. She asks him to show her the worst it can get. When he does shes eventually crying yes but shes also counting along with him each time he whips her. So its not as though shes rendered speechless yet she CHOOSES not to use her safe word which would stop him instantly. Through all of their sexual encounters SHE NEVER ONCE SAYS NO. So. BDSM? Certainly. Not to everyones taste? Certainly. Rape? Not even close.Universal Pictures/TNSDakota Johnson easily the best thing about ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" in any iteration3) Back to the film Its funny. Dakota Johnson especially shows a rare gift for timing and nuance and hers and Christians early encounters are frequently hilarious. Even Christians control-freak ways earn a laugh or two. And when at her job in a hardware store she helps him find duct tape cable ties and rope then laughingly calls him a ""perfect serial killer"" weve seen enough of Christian to understand that that is NOT where this is headed.Ill say this about the film - it actually got me curious about what happens in the next two books something the first book didnt even come close to doing. Ill go see the next movie quite happily. Read the second and/or third books? NO. And no means no.Follow JoyTipping editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

(Universal) By Stephanie Merry February 12 2015 Follow stephmerry The movie adaptation of E.L. Jamess best-selling book ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" was always destined to be a blockbuster; the quality of the film was beside the point. After all the erotic romance novel based on saucy ""Twilight"" fan-fiction did great business despite being a 500-page lesson in how not to use a thesaurus. Millions of readers paid their dues skimming countless boring scenes with a narrator who says nothing more profound than ""holy cow"" and ""double crap"" so they could get to the good stuff bondage-laced sex scenes between the storys innocent protagonist and her impossibly hot impossibly rich damaged-goods love interest. So you have to hand it to director Sam Taylor-Johnson and screenwriter Kelly Marcel for making a film that while not as titillating as the book is a much better adaptation than the source material deserves. The pair stripped out the more idiotic dialogue -- leaving behind one ""holy cow"" --streamlined the preposterous plot and most important made a very smart casting decision by placing Dakota Johnson the daughter of Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson in the lead role. Between pratfalls and perfectly timed facial expressions Johnson brings a steady stream of humor to the part of college senior Anastasia Steele while also nailing the sexy ingenue vibe. Its immediately clear that Johnson is up to the task of transforming an annoying even embarrassing character into a likable one When Anastasia first enters the Seattle offices of billionaire Christian Grey she looks around in wonder at the tall impeccably dressed blondes that work for him before glancing down at her own getup with a hilarious look of dismay. Casting Dakota Johnson as the lead was a smart decision. (Universal Pictures/Focus Features) The slightly unkempt Anastasia is there to interview the 27-year-old self-serious entrepreneur for the school newspaper. In both the movie and the book the awkward first meeting begins with Anastasia taking a spill as soon as she enters the office. From there the novel quickly becomes an overwrought description of funny feelings down below while the movie wisely keeps things in comedic territory for as long as possible. Comedy and chemistry are not mutually exclusive but during this opening scene of supposed animal magnetism the spark doesnt quite materialize. Irish actor Jamie Dornan portrays the wounded moneymaker with such restraint that he never channels anything more than his own good looks (which are indeed very good). In any case so begins a flirtation between the two that ultimately leads to a nondisclosure agreement -- never a good sign during a relationships early stages -- followed by an introduction to Christians ""playroom."" Or as Anastasia calls it his Red Room of Pain a locked chamber in Christians penthouse where he likes to get busy with the help of various implements -- floggers whips shackles you know the usual. All of which leads to yet another contract. Will the virginal Anastasia agree to be the submissive to Christians dom? Hes upfront about the fact that he doesnt ""do romance"" but he likes her so much hes willing to sweeten the deal. If she spends each weekend being essentially his sex slave hell spend one night a week doing normal couple things. Two days of punishment in exchange for dinner and a movie seems like a raw deal in every sense and Johnson makes this whole ridiculous scenario seem believable by responding not with impassioned earnestness but with a healthy dose of incredulity ""What do I get out of this?"" That contract is about as much plot as youre going to get. Whether she will sign on the dotted line is the mystery that powers the narrative and it isnt much to go on. Of course the tedium of doing business is broken up by about 15 minutes of sexcapades. Compared to the book which features a much-discussed scene involving a tampon the movie is a model of moderation. Every sexual encounter plays out to the soothing strains of some lovely vocalist (Sia Beyonce) and careful framing means we see plenty of skin but not as much as you might expect for a chronicle of fringy sexual habits. Dornan doesnt even get totally naked for the camera. Taylor-Johnson clearly was going for an R rating and even with what the MPAA deemed ""unusual behavior"" -- including one difficult-to-watch whipping -- no scene comes close to earning an NC-17 designation. In the end theres nothing here we havent seen before. But theres also nothing as agonizingly awkward as Jamess prose. Fifty Shades of Grey   (125 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for strong sexual content including dialogue some unusual behavior and graphic nudity and for language. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Lets get this out of the way--those going into Fifty Shades Of Grey expecting an erotic experience are going to be disappointed. The sex scenes are all tastefully shot and save for the much-ballyhooed BDSM trappings not especially provocative. (The French were right on this one.) But even if the film were NC-17-level explicit it wouldnt make that much of a difference. Leads Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson both of whom spend the majority of the film supposedly desperately longing for each other have so little chemistry that it gives the sexy goings-on a rather clinical feel.Hardcore fans of the book may also be disappointed. Director Sam Taylor-Johnson who reportedly clashed with author E.L. James over nearly every aspect of the film brings an arch irreverent take to the story that makes Fifty Shades Of Grey occasionally resemble the American Psycho of mommy porn. The film benefits greatly from discarding the authorial voice of the book (Anastasia Steeles inner goddess remains silent thank God) and where James frankly embarrassing dialogue does come through its played for laughs. (There are no ""holy crap""s but there is one ""holy cow."") Ostensibly erotic moments like a stolen kiss in an elevator come with a punchline reinforcing the notion that Taylor-Johnson doesnt want us to take all this swooning romantic nonsense at face value. Its got a Danny Elfman score for fucks sake.However somewhere around the first sex scene the winking self-awareness begins to recede and to its detriment Fifty Shades Of Grey starts taking itself seriously. By the time we actually get to the light BDSM--images of women bound with rope that Ana finds horrifying are more Helmut Newton than Kink.com--the 125-minute running time begins itself to feel like a punishment. Thats also when Taylor-Johnson begins trying to shoehorn a feminist message about sexual agency into what is essentially a fairy tale with MacBook Pros (suave billionaire prince comes to sweep ordinary girl off her feet and tell her shes special). The results are mixed--its more empowering than the book though thats not saying much--but you cant fault her for trying.Another aspect of the film that might be subversive provided it was intentional is Dornans performance as 27-year-old billionaire and kinky Prince Charming Christian Grey. Dornan appears to have mistaken lack of affect for mystery and despite his assertion that hes ""50 shades of fucked up"" he has about three shades four at best. The characters creepier more abusive tendencies while impossible to remove entirely (can we just mention that he tracks Anas location by tracing her phone?) are downplayed and Christian functions as a sort of well-dressed Wikipedia article about BDSM onto which Ana can project her inner conflict. The Fetlife crowd is right to object to the books (and films) continued insistence that Christian is kinky because he was abused as a child--somehow his protestations of ""Its just the way I am"" never quite stick--but the cinematic Christian Grey is too toothless to really be threatening. Dakota Johnson on the other hand is the unexpected highlight of the film. She gives Ana a strength of personality thats lacking in the book subtly transforming the character from a breathy house-mouse who never makes eye contact into a glamorous intelligent woman who knows what she wants and has no problem articulating it. The story begins when Ana visits Christians office to interview him for her college newspaper a meeting that wouldnt have happened if Anas roommate were not sick that day. Charmed by her shyness Christian begins aggressively pursuing Ana showing up unannounced at her workplace and at the bar where she drunk dials him one sodden night after her final exams. In the book he maintains dominance throughout pressuring her to sign an (unrealistic) D/s contract that will make her ""his."" One telling change between the book and the film is in the negotiation of the contract between Christian and Ana; a dinner scene where Ana struggles to maintain composure is replaced by a playful ""business meeting"" proposed and controlled by Ana. Shes stringing him along not the other way around.These aspects of the film--making the hot guy (the ostensible draw) the most boring part of the movie while imbuing the female lead with personality presenting the submissive as the partner truly in control of the situation--could be seen as subversive. They might even be empowering as much as a story about a womans desire to fix a damaged man with the power of love can be. And well see if Fifty Shades Of Grey is the subject of revisionist think pieces in the decades to come. It certainly wont be remembered for its technical merits as Taylor-Johnson has crafted a bland slickly unexceptional-looking film with a soundtrack of cover songs as empty as the echoing expanse of Christian Greys high-rise.The answers to these questions might lie in the ending of the film which Taylor-Johnson wanted to change from James version. (Plot revelations ahead obviously.) In the film Ana runs out of Christians apartment after he finally at Anas request shows her the true extent of his sadism. He runs after her and as the doors of the elevator close she turns and yells ""Stop"" which turns into an exchange of pleasantries echoing their initial meeting. Taylor-Johnson wanted to change Anas assertion to ""Red"" their agreed-upon safe word. It might seem like a small change but think about that for a minute. In Taylor-Johnsons version Ana knows this is all a game and she can end it at any time. In James version Ana is still in thrall to Christian a more romantic and not insignificantly sequel-friendly version of events. In the end James won the argument and the movie stayed true to her vision. Maybe thats why it fails. Share Tweet Filed Under Film Dakota Johnson Sam Taylor-Johnson Jamie Dornan E.L.

April 10 2015 -- 1159am Video (0223)  This is the hotly anticipated film adaptation of the bestselling book that has become a global phenomenon. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Colin Covert colincovert I have no objection to films whose characters have gymnastic bedroom flings while firmly tied and controlled by others. Honestly the famed sex scene between two clumsy string-controlled marionettes in ""Team America World Police"" was an offensive blast. Sadly ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" doesnt entertainingly cross the line of good taste so much as trip and fall on it. The much-anticipated movie opens promisingly with a bluesy Annie Lennox cover of the 1956 classic ""I Put a Spell on You"" which fits the films kinky motif. From then its all downhill. Shot in the manner of a ho-hum perfume commercial ""Fifty Shades"" takes itself all too seriously when it needs a healthy jolt of cynicism and irony. Watching it doesnt inspire creative naughty new romantic ideas. It torpedoes the libido and invites snoregasms. Adapted from the first book of E.L. James bestselling sadomasochist trilogy the film arrives in an atmosphere of hoopla that no movie deserves. It introduces shy literature student Ana (Dakota Johnson) who begins a dominant/submissive affair with Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) an authoritarian businessman with a vast collection of bedroom pulleys bondage ropes and riding crops in a sinister red room. His proclivities include pain pleasure and schmaltzy piano solos when he is feeling a bout of his ongoing self-pity. He mustnt be kissed or touched you see because he began life very painfully. The cigarette burn scars on his frequently bare chest hint at how that went on. The liaison between the 21-year-old virgin and the 27-year-old billionaire is a rather mysterious relationship. After she briefly interviews him for an article in his alma maters magazine the aloof entrepreneur is hypnotically drawn to her. Although he runs a vast Seattle tech firm Christian has plenty of free time to court Ana (or stalk her as it often feels). How does he peg the meek retiring girl as the perfect potential partner in his spank-centric fantasies? How does she who early on asks the male ice queen if hes gay return his fixation? Well he showers her with expensive gifts which feels more like coercion than seduction and she channeling Mary Tyler Moore continually calls him ""Mr. Grey."" As their dates deepen he insists that she sign a domination contract agreeing to follow his rules or receive a solid whacking. Its not in film terms a match made in heaven. Johnson is a charming presence agreeably cute and nicely expressive helping lift the scripts sluggish juiceless attempts at humor. When Ana greets Christian at breakfast following their first overnight in his Olympian suite Johnson turns ""Im making pancakes"" into a true giggle. Dornan is not dreadful in a role that is two-dimensional at best suggesting that cyborg-style control freak Christian has a bit of warmth and humor. (Not all that much of course; when a college pal of Anas offers her a hug and smooch Christian jumps atop him from nowhere like Batman.) The central problem of the movies many shortcomings is that there is absolutely no chemistry between the stars. Throughout their publicity tour before the films release Dornan and Johnson gave the impression they utterly despise each other just as interviews with director Sam Taylor-Johnson revealed how deeply she dislikes the hot-tempered novelist James who fought for more bondage scenes. There were by my wristwatch only about 40 minutes of whacking and wriggling involving blindfolds lashes and ice cubes. That seemed like enough.

(AP Photo/Universal Pictures and Focus Features) Fifty Shades of Grey is lewd but limp By Joe Williams St. Louis Post-Dispatch Joe Williams Feb 12 2015 (...) Chuck Zlotnick In this image released by Universal Pictures and Focus Features Dakota Johnson left and Jamie Dornan appear in a scene from ""Fifty Shades of Grey."" (AP Photo/Universal Pictures and Focus Features) Sows ear meet silk purse.E.L. James ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" is a trashy and laughably bad book about bondage that has sold more copies in three years than Fyodor Dostoyevskys collected works have sold since 1846. Thats a crime and the punishment is being inflicted on all of us as were being threatened with a film trilogy as well as countless blog musings about the meaning of masochism in modern relationships.Yet theres some good news for those who arent quite ready to enter the dungeon. The movie version of ""Fifty Shades"" is better than the book. Its still awful but when a filmmaker starts with stupid source material hes handcuffed. Or in this case its a she. Director Sam Taylor-Johnson made the smart sensitive film ""Nowhere Boy"" about John Lennons love for his estranged mother and she proves to be a good choice for burnishing this femme-centric potboiler. Reportedly she and James clashed on the set and some of the books steamier scenes including one involving a tampon were left to molder on the cutting-room floor.What we get instead is a parody of romance-novel plotting. Sporting the kind of name youd find only in a fantasy shy Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson daughter of Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith) is a student at Washington State University who drives 90 miles to Seattle to interview hunky young billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) for the school newspaper. Hes an utter tool the kind of poker-faced pretty boy who repeatedly calls her ""Miss Steele"" and finishes her sentences for her. Yet Anastasia later raves to her roommate (Eloise Mumford playing a hard-partying valedictorian) that the handsome hotshot is so ""courteous"" and ""clean.""Actually hes quite dirty but only the most special woman gets to enter his ""playroom.""Its both easy and pointless to ponder the social implications of a story about a billionaire who gets his jollies from flogging a penniless innocent. (Christian actually cheers when he learns that Anastasia is a virgin.)This is soft-core commercialism without a trace of real-world relevance. Taylor-Johnson stokes the flames for the female audience with lugubrious music and innumerable shots of Anastasia biting her lower lip as Christian guides her toward the slaughterhouse as if she were a veal calf with a ring in her nose.""Fifty Shades"" is hardly the first mainstream movie about bondage. But unlike the imports ""Nymphomaniac"" or ""Tie Me Up Tie Me Down"" theres nothing subversive or scary about it. Taylor-Johnson gives us lots of exquisitely lit scenes of the shirtless Christian binding and banging Anastasia like a Cinemax stud.But the likably coy Johnson has no chemistry with the dreary self-serious Dornan. Hes a casting disaster and no amount of backstory trauma can explain his characters obsession with a mousy student whose only personality attribute is a lack thereof.Notwithstanding Christians private helicopter his penthouse and his fleet of Ferraris its not remotely plausible that this dim-witted creep is a tech billionaire. If he were he could teach the producers of this misbegotten project a core principle of software programming ""Garbage in garbage out.""What ""Fifty Shades of Grey""  Two stars out of four  Rating R  Run time 207  Content Strong sexual content including dialogue some unusual behavior and graphic nudity and for language Joe Williams  314-340-8344Film criticjoethecritic on Twitterjoewilliamspost-dispatch.com Multimedia Color of controversy 10 shades of cinematic scandal Feb 12 2015 (...)

"50 Shades of Grey (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review 50 Shades of Grey (R) The film adaptation of E.L. James bestselling kinky novel isnt torture to sit through. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle cogleMiamiHerald.com2/12/2015 Editor rating 2.5 Put down your handcuffs and leave the blindfolds in the drawer. You wont need those props to get you through a viewing of Fifty Shades of Grey. Despite what you might fear the movie is not torture. And even if it doesnt inspire lust you will breathe a warm sigh of relief thinking This could have been so much worse. Director Sam Taylor-Johnson (Nowhere Boy) and screenwriter Kelly Marcel (Saving Mr. Banks) have taken E.L. James ridiculous and painfully earnest bestseller about the relationship between clueless virginal college grad Anastasia Steele and hot dominating billionaire control freak Christian Grey and shaped it into something resembling actual entertainment. Taylor-Johnson and Marcel approach the story with the right mix of humor melodrama and steamy sex which is not as explicit as you expect but not as vanilla as you have been led to believe (the theater I saw it in got very quiet during a scene involving a tie and an ice cube). The filmmakers have sensibly operated on the time-honored The Bridges of Madison County Principle which states that adapted right with most of the cringe-worthy dialogue removed a movie can transcend poorly written source material. This is not to say Fifty Shades of Grey is transcendent. Its really just dumb fun for a girls night out or maybe even a date night sticking close to the book plotwise but moving the story along more rapidly and wisely swerving from the more ludicrous aspects of its characters. The film follows Anastasia and Christians first meeting -- shes ineptly interviewing him for a college newspaper hes clearly intrigued -- and their growing mutual attraction. He stops by the hardware store where she works flirts and buys a number of suggestive items (not surprisingly she does not realize what the rope is for -- yet). He asks her out for coffee then appalled at her girlish enthusiasm for romance storms off telling her she should leave him alone. She wants to date like normal people. He has another sort of relationship in mind and eventually reveals his Red Room of Pain to her full of sex toys and frightening devices that clank out of the ceiling telling her he wants to dominate her and asking her to sign a contract agreeing to a bizarre arrangement that will make her his submissive. Taylor-Johnson handles the negotiation scene particularly well The contract in the book caused only hilarity for readers and the director understands that even the guy wanting this would need to have a sense of humor to get through a discussion about it. I can promise you if someone ever presented me with paperwork negotiating the size and shape of butt plugs to be used at a later date there would be a lot of laughter. As Anastasia Steele Dakota Johnson (Need for Speed Beastly The Social Network) is still surprisingly inexperienced for a 21-year-old in the 21st century but shes not the babbling ninny of the book who has never been kissed and squeals over acquiring an email address. Shes also able to show Anastasias incredulity at Christians request while at the same time making us understand why shed even flirt with the possibility of signing on for this relationship something the book never quite managed. For his part Irish actor Jamie Dornan (The Fall) is shockingly adept at humanizing the impossible character of Christian Grey whos about oh so much more than nipple clamps and duct tape (you can tell because he plays melancholy classical tunes on his baby grand after sex). Much has been made of the actors lack of chemistry at their various press appearances but on screen their awkward nervy interactions work just fine and as their relationship progresses and grows more tense their scenes grow more erotically charged until the final one when everything falls apart. The script inevitably makes a few missteps -- Marcel really should have resisted the temptation to have Christian groan in anguish ""Im 50 shades of f---ed up"" and allusions to Christians sad past are an unwelcome oversimplification -- but at least theres no chirpy Anastasia internalizing her inner goddess. The movie is ultimately incomplete; this is part one of a trilogy and so the ending is far from satisfying. I hate to confess this but Ill probably go back to see part 2. Wouldnt you?

Richard Corliss Feb. 12 2015 SHARE Chuck Zlotnick--Universal Pictures Dakota Johnson and James Dornan star in Fifty Shades of Grey The movie of the trash-lit sensation is sometimes intelligent often cuddlesome and ultimately bland. Is this your idea of a date-night movie? I come as a virgin to the Fifty Shades of Grey phenomenon having read not a word of E L James three bestsellers -- ignorant of the voluminous online commentaries knowing little of the movie adaptation. So I take notes like Washington State University student Anastasia Steele and share them with you. Here are 15 takes on Fifty Shades 1. Anastasia (Dakota Johnson in the movie) literally stumbles into a meeting with Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) 27-year-old owner of a huge Seattle IT company to which he pays almost no attention since he is instantly obsessed with the frazzled unconfident we-wont-say-mousy Anastasia. Smitten he proposes that she be his sex slave -- under stringent lavish conditions. She takes the first book to consider his proposal and the rest of the trilogy to ... well you probably know. I dont. Anyway there are three. 2. A hundred million copies sold And apparently its the lowest form of prose fiction -- less literature than shiterature -- with the enticement of gaudy bondage-and-discipline scenes. Inspired by the young adult Twilight series James wrote for Actual Adults women mostly to whose wishes feats and dreams the risky romance of Ana and Christian spoke. 3. The Fifty Shades of Grey film opens in a double-whammy four days -- Valentines Day in the middle of Presidents Day weekend -- and is expected to stoke a 90-million windfall. For some its a hearts-and-floggers date movie A couple attends the movie then he asks ""Dinner or my Red Room of Pain?"" And mothers in the mall theyll tell their kids to go back and see the SpongeBob SquarePants movie another time-and-a-half. ""Mom has some shopping to do"" -- for fantasies of romance and submission whips and wisdom. 4. Among the early reviews the critics are split between favorable and dismissive. And not to bury the lede any deeper Ill say while watching Fifty Shades I kept waiting to tumble into derision but never got there. My early curiosity built to a cozy level of admiration then drifted off into ennui. 5. James (real name Erika Mitchell) tweaked the Twilight teen virgin Bella Swan into the slightly older Anastasia and reimagined sensitive vampire Edward as the well-mannered sadist Christian. The result had all the fidelity and floridity of fan fiction. The movie directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson and scripted by Kelly Marcel is just the opposite. Its as if the filmmakers didnt care much for the books literary lapses and dramatic excesses and set out to make a solidly ethereal romance about a smart girl who realizes her strength when she meets a lost boy eager to fill her power vacuum. 6. Gone is Jamess careless jargon; Anastasia doesnt keep saying ""Holy crap"" Diminished degraded or simply hinted at are The Big Scenes. Johnson and Dornan spend plenty of time undressed (she fully nude he topless but rarely trouserless or towelless); there are spankings and just a soupcon of wicked whiplash. But the lovemaking is mostly tender canoodling cuddling. Its all foreplay. Creating a genteel R-rated film from a very X-rated book is like making a Mamma Mia movie without the songs. 7. Sadomasochistic romance ought to be a burgeoning movie genre because it touches on the power vectors in any relationship and because each person frequently switches roles of dominant and submissive youre on top you give in. Once in a while such a story connects becomes a film sensation as when Marlon Brando toyed with Maria Schneider in an unfurnished Paris hotel room in Bernardo Bertoluccis Last Tango in Paris. Mark Rylance took the Brando role and Kerry Fox the Schneider in the more sexually explicit art-house drama Intimacy in 2001. 8. Last Tango was so long ago 1972. Back then films strove mightily to be as mature and confrontational as novels and theater; and a movie house was the only place that a group of strangers could find public connection to erotic ecstasy and anguish. Shortly thereafter (Star Wars) cinema reverted to a kids medium and trained audiences to want only spectacle and sensation action epics horror films rowdy comedies -- circuses. Lets go Wow Eek or Ha together. Watching people make love is not participatory but nakedly voyeuristic; everyone in the auditorium feels weird. They laugh nervously or contemptuously to prove their superiority to the urgent intensity on screen. Besides they dont need simulated sex in a theater; they can see the real thing for free online at home. 9. But the E L James readership presumably wanted to see writhing walloped bodies in the movie. Why is it rated R not NC-17? For the reason most things are what they are in Hollywood greed. Many theaters would not show a scrupulous adaptation; fewer people would pay to see it. Hence this Fifty Shades of Pale Grey which underlines the filmmakers intuition that this is less a sex tale than a love story. 10. Or possibly a commodity exchange. Christian a dreamboat in conservative coiffure and couture is a 50-year dreamboat throwback a generic James Bond or Hugh Hefners early Playboy man whose essential accessories included sleek cars well-chosen wines and a stock of beautiful women. Christian tries to win Anastasia by buying her things (a car a new wardrobe) and paying her things (attention respect). He takes her for a trip in his private helicopter first applying seat belts like airborne erotic restraints and somersaulting in a glider. Its a seductive dream of luxe but maybe more his than hers. She will let her mind lead her heart in a long amusing debate in contract law the terms of Christians pre-whup. Anastasia gives it so much scrupulous attention -- no fisting for example -- that any signer of a smartphone or health-club agreement would be wise to engage her as an advisor. 11. Ideally sadomasochism is the most complementary of sexual role-players. You cant have one without the other. Otherwise its torture. (Thats what safe words are for.) Christian veteran of 15 previous dominant-submissive relationships has chosen Anastasia as his next partner. But she needs to decide if pain can give her pleasure. Does she like it? Can she stand it for love of him? Can she upend his priorities and make herself the dominant? The 514 pages of the first Fifty Shades book and the two-hour movie still havent answered that question. Stay tuned for two more sequels. 12. In Christians ""playroom"" decorated like the upmarket gift shop of a Louisiana bordello we finally get to the climax six whacks of a riding crop which he gently carefully prepares her for. Even by movie standards the flogging is more ceremonial than sadistic. It hasnt nearly the sickening impact of the 40 lashes given Mel Gibsons Jesus in The Passion of the Christ or the eight or 10 minutes spent on the torture of poor Patsey in 12 Years a Slave. The Fifty Shades scene is brief and demure. One might like to see the impact of Christians whipping on Anas emotions perhaps pain shading into surprised enjoyment or hardening into the resolve of revenge. But thats for some other movie. Dont we all dream up our private ones? 13. So Christian is a shade of Jane Austens Mr. Darcy. Dornan 32 and Irish is old-school handsome with soft features. He could be the young Colin Firth minus the sad merriment in his eyes. (For film-history symmetry Jennifer Ehle who was Elizabeth Bennet to Firths Darcy in the 1995 BBC Pride and Prejudice miniseries plays Anastasias blowzy mother.) The producers first hoped to cast Ryan Gosling but he would have made Christian sulkier more brooding more Heathcliff. Manacles on the moors 14. The movies warming revelation is Johnson as Anastasia. The 25-year-old daughter of Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson (and looking like neither of them) she has the gift of signaling her characters shifting thoughts and feelings through the ripples of smile lines on either side of her mouth. Director Taylor-Johnson relies on closeups of her star as the heroine the wordless narrator and the go-between assuring the audience that what goes on will have a measure of emotional intelligence. 15. Having built tension by nicely guiding viewers smoothly through Christians courtship of Ana Taylor-Johnson has little to deliver as a climax erotic or dramatic. The submissive gets cropped doesnt like it and walks out in an ending that is startlingly abrupt -- and to one impressionable audience of New York critics the cue for a thunderclap of pig-snorts. The real moviegoers who see it by the tens of millions this weekend may have a reaction more like mine muted pleased and restless in turn. Well all have participated in an international event that like the Super Bowl neednt be loved but must be endured. And in a movie universe where a grownup couple rarely gets the chance to challenge each other with love and bondage Fifty Shades of Grey offers the first cant-miss Date Night film since Gone Girl.

Certainly theres nothing even vaguely smoldering about this limp and lifeless film.E.L. James erotic ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" trilogy seduced millions with its soft porn romance between a virgin and a sadist. Shes got the looks hes got the money. Its Jane Austen with ""safe words."" For those who read the books theres no doubt getting to imagine what the characters looked like was part of the pulse-racing pizazz. No longer. Make no mistake Dakota Johnson is suitably lovely as the shy Anastasia Steele and Jamie Dornan is appropriately chiseled as billionaire Christian Grey. Still they generate zilch in the way of heat. The thundering lack of chemistry might be less mind-numbing if the film offered something in the way of delicious dialogue. Frankly the movie might be more entertaining if it were as silent as it is filthy. That way we wouldnt have to cringe our way through lines like ""Im not going to touch you until I have your written consent."" Raunchy eye candy is all well and good and Johnson a waifish cross of her parents Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson bites her lip frequently and fetchingly. But while Dornan a former Calvin Klein model displays some very impressive abdominal and gluteus muscles pretty body parts arent enough to carry a two-hour picture.Advertisement Indeed Seamus McGarveys cinematography is as glossy and smooth as a perfume commercial but with just as much gravitas. The tone is so slow and sedate the sex scenes so generic its hard to get hot and bothered about any of it. For the record theres plenty of skin in the infamous Red Room of Pain but very little erotic charge. Sure there are games with whips and cuffs and blindfolds but theres little sense that anyone is experiencing more than a frisson of arousal. Fans of kinky taboos might get more bang out of the average episode of ""Game of Thrones."" Thats perhaps mostly the fault of Dornan who cant find a way to ground Greys brooding perversity in something human and real. The actor seems to be simply going through the X-rated motions. Its also strange that in the hot-and-heavy scenes hes often wearing pants.Johnson brings a welcome sauciness to her submissive role (particularly in the never-ending contractual negotiation scene) and she does her best to gild the twisted high jinks with lust and yearning but Dornan doesnt give her much to work with. Most of the bedroom action is pretty ho-hum except for a scene involving a belt and many tears thats just plain disturbing. You also cant help but feel a little sorry for substantive actresses such as Jennifer Ehle who plays Anastasias loving mother and Marcia Gay Harden as Christians bossy adoptive mother who are squandering their craftsmanship in this smutty time killer. About an hour in it finally dawned on me that perhaps the movie was giving me insights into masochism after all. As the minutes slowly painfully ticked by I came to accept my punishment. Apparently there are sequels planned. Shudder.Contact Karen DSouza at 408-271-3772.

"Review Fifty Shades of Grey - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review Fifty Shades of Grey Dakota Johnson outshines Jamie Dornan in Fifty Shades of Grey Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips is joined by Associated Press film writer Lindsey Bahr to discuss their opinions of the romantic thriller adaptation. Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips is joined by Associated Press film writer Lindsey Bahr to discuss their opinions of the romantic thriller adaptation. Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Far less heinous than the book. Dakota Johnsons good; Jamie Dornans working on it. Adapted and directed by women of considerably larger talent than novelist E.L. James the film version of ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" turns out to be an intriguing tussle -- not in the sack or in the Red Room of Pain but in its internal war between the dubious erotica of James novel (the first of three) and the far craftier trash offered by the movie.Its poetic justice. James love story concerns an impossibly rich sexually exotic emotionally remote billionaire and the collegiate virgin who becomes the Submissive to his Dominant in the parlance of the bondage/discipline/sado-masochism realm. The novel is very likely the worst-written international bestseller since the ""Twilight"" series and maybe since once upon a time in the same kingdom of forbidden love ""The Bridges of Madison County."" What has happened with ""Fifty Shades of Grey""? As with the first ""Twilight"" movie back in 2008 the one directed with canny low-key commitment by Catherine Hardwicke James book has been de-crudified  its most operatic expressions of lust stricken from the record. That leaves the greasy sexualized violence of the premise but even that has been tilted ever so slightly to a more skeptical position.Director Sam Taylor-Johnson and her adapter Kelly Marcel remain true to the Etch-a-Sketch contours of the narrative up to and including the abrupt cliffhanger ending that really doesnt work in a stand-alone movie. At a recent screening yelps of frustration greeted the final exchange between Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey as they reached the impasse setting up books two and three. So. While the film will surely kill this Valentines Day weekend those yelps may point to a medium-smash as opposed to an extra-large model. Rumors of James getting all whips-and-chainsy with her on-set demands during filming have been circulating ever since the first photos appeared of Dakota Johnson who plays Ana and Jamie Dornan a.k.a. His Abcellence as Christian. I wonder if James could even recognize some of the screenplays exchanges since they occasionally approximate human speech and in the crucial case of Ana create a female protagonist who isnt entirely a doormat. The set-ups the same as it was in the book. Covering for her ailing college roommate (Eloise Mumford very good) bookish but demurely smoldering Ana interviews the elusive Mr. Grey for a class assignment. Smolder smolder smolder and pretty soon Ana and Christian are dating sort of. His stalkerish behavior and insane control-freakery is mitigated by exquisite taste in wines and a penchant for shirtlessly interpreting melancholy sonatas at the keyboard with the lights of Seattle far below. Fifty Shades of Grey trailer Fifty Shades of Grey trailer for the movie that premiers on Valentines Day 2014. Fifty Shades of Grey trailer for the movie that premiers on Valentines Day 2014. See more videos Like the vampire and werewolf hunks of the ""Twilight"" series Christian is forbidden fruit served hot. Ana is the retrograde heroine metaphorically tied to a railroad track (and later literally tied to other things) who yearns for adventure and release and a healthy way to explore her dawning sexuality and find a boyfriend wholl open up a little. Is that so much? But it is. It is so much in this world. The bulk of ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" presents a world ruled by a helicopter-flying gym rat raised on a steady diet of ""9 1/2 Weeks"" Zalman Kings soft-core cable fantasies and fashion spreads straight out of ""Muted Blues and Greys Monthly.""The surprise if there is a surprise here is that the film has found a slyly humorous tone for much of the running time. Johnson gets all the right kinds of laughs with Anas flustered or chops-busting reactions to her Dominants latest exhibitions of A) hotness or B) scariness. Reading the novel which set a record for high-volume clinically successful yet grimly downbeat orgasms in mainstream erotica nobody and nothing seemed human or even humanoid. The movie actually does though Dornan struggles to keep up with Johnsons loose ingratiating rhythms. Hes not terrible but the Northern Ireland natives dialect work (going for neutral American) doesnt quite sound natural and he has a way of hitting one note emotionally per scene and sticking with it while trying not to blink. This is what they teach models-turned-actors at the Hawklike Stare School of Troubled Dreamboats. Latest movies reviewedOpen link Even de-crudified the world the ethos and the selling points of the ""Fifty Shades"" phenomenon are to me suspect and hollow. The story exhibits zero interest in how a contrivance such as Christian could possibly compartmentalize his interests to this degree and still be called an earthling. However much or little intercourse is involved popular fiction often showcases impossible fantasies in lieu of people; its the golden ticket in ""Gone Girl"" among others. For an hour or so director Taylor-Johnson sidesteps the biggest land mines in her material but as Christians possessive obsessive secret-laden nature gathers the storm clouds overhead and Ana goads her master into testing her limits theres only so much a director can do to pretend the material is something it isnt. Going in I expected either a camp hoot or a complete slavishly faithful Submissive of a film playing opposite the Dominant novel. Instead ""Fifty Shades"" turns out to be roughly as pretty good as the first ""Twilight"" -- appropriate since James wrote ""Fifty Shades"" as sexed-up loinzapoppin  fan fiction paying tribute to the ""Twilight"" bestsellers. For the record ""Fifty Shades"" has been banned outright in Malaysia while receiving a 13-and-up rating in France.

Photo Universal Pictures / Universal Pictures / Focus Features Fifty Shades review Actors breathe life into weak script 1 / 3 Back to Gallery To see ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" is to realize that movies could really use more sex scenes directed by women. Women know how to take their time. As directed Sam Taylor-Johnson those bedroom and playroom interludes are as erotic as any reader of E.L. James novel might hope them to be and theyre not at all lewd. Theyre effective because theyre personal all about the people involved and their longing. In a movie thats as much about sex as this one thats a major asset and ""Fifty Shades"" has the additional advantage of two charismatic leads in the main roles. Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan are not merely adequate. She is instantly engaging and the focus of the audiences sympathetic attention from start to finish and he is always interesting. We will be seeing them for years and not just in ""Fifty Shades"" sequels. Related Stories Sex on the screen a century of double standards With all that going for it one might wonder what else could matter. The enormous make-or-break things are perfectly in place and just that is enough for a reasonably enjoyable movie. But plot problems some comically weak dialogue repetitious scenes and a nonending ending keep the experience a little more earthbound than it had to be. All the films problems can be traced to the novel which is ironically just the kind of book that often makes for a successful film Its bad but it has something. Theres something there if youre willing to blast for it. So the task of the screenwriter would seem to be straightforward to mine the novel for the elements that work and fix what doesnt -- except with a famous book you cant do that not without starting a revolution in the audience. Still for the first hour ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" is almost entirely successful. Anastasia Steele (Johnson) a college student goes to the office tower of 27-year-old billionaire Christian Grey (Dornan) to conduct an interview with him for the school paper. He is confident and decisive and she is scattered and diffident. But something in the honesty of her essence penetrates his practiced facade so that each represents something the other wants. In a reversal of what we usually see in movies its the woman who is overcome with lust for the man and these early scenes in which Ana tries with all her might to hold it together in his presence contain many funny little moments subtly executed. Johnsons direction is full of light specific touches as when we see Ana from behind glancing at the clothing of the women in Greys office and realizing she is underdressed. Watching this film particularly during its first hour but later too one gets the impression of a director who knows the script has nothing to offer her but the central relationship of Ana and Christian. So she works with her two actors making every scene rich with nuance and backstory with moment-by-moment stratagems and barely perceptible shifts in power. She takes time to build the characters lust for each other so that their lust gradually becomes the audiences lust. Once Ana and Christian have sex for the first time and especially after theyve had sex for the second time the movie starts to sag. There are too many similar scenes in which she tries to get close and he tries to get her to sign some contract agreeing to become his ""submissive"" partner in sadomasochistic sex games. Curiously though these scenes become tiresome Johnson and Dornan never do. Nor does the odd romance of Ana and Christian ever become a matter of indifference. We always care; we just wish theyd talk about something new. Some scenes are so lazily written they become funny. At one point Christian is having some business trouble and this is what he shouts into his phone ""Tell them they dont have 24 hours ... This is unacceptable ... Keep me informed"" The only way thats good business dialogue is if a sequel later reveals that Christian really isnt a businessman that hes been faking it. Still Im not going to pretend I didnt like this movie just as I cant pretend theres nothing wrong with it. But try thinking of it this way Its an event movie thats also a relationship drama and thats rare. Finally it should be said Dakota Johnson is not related to Sam Taylor-Johnson but is the daughter of Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith and Griffith is the daughter of Tippi Hedren. So young Miss Johnson can be seen as the happy end-result of a three-generation genetic experiment conducted on celluloid. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

"Fifty Shades of Grey brings little pleasure - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Fifty Shades of Grey brings little pleasure Fifty Shades of Grey Universal Pictures / Focus Features Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson in a scene shot in Christian Greys penthouse. Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson in a scene shot in Christian Greys penthouse. (Universal Pictures / Focus Features) Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter Film critic KennethTuran calls Fifty Shades a genially preposterous fairy tale. Read his review More years ago than I want to remember I was wandering down a disreputable street near New Yorks once-seedy Times Square when I spied a hand-lettered sign in front of a storefront theater. ""At Last"" the poster read. ""A Bondage Film With a Believable Story Line""I dont remember what film was playing but it certainly wasnt ""Fifty Shades of Grey."" An unashamed and genially preposterous fairy tale a kind of ""Cinderella"" with restraints ""50 Shades"" is about as believable as ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" albeit considerably more kinky in intent.Though it has its charms including pleasing and well-matched actors Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan as the star-crossed couple these pleasures have little to do with the bondage-themed sexual encounters that enabled E.L. James badly written unapologetically graphic trilogy of novels to sell a whopping 100 million copies in 52 languages worldwide. In fact the celebrated kinky elements in ""Fifty Shades"" are so used as a tease in this considerably less explicit film (rated no more than R for among other things ""some unusual behavior"") that when the worst does take place -- its a painful and distinctly unpleasant whipping if you must know -- it feels so out of place it seems to have come from a different film altogether. Fifty Shades of Grey Movie review by Kenneth Turan Kenneth Turan reviews Fifty Shades of Grey starring Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan reviews Fifty Shades of Grey starring Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan. Video by Jason H. Neubert. See more videos As adapted from the novel by Kelly Marcel (""Saving Mr. Banks"") ""Fifty Shades"" fits snugly into a very specific Hollywood mold the romance between the millionaire and the shop girl with roots that go at least as far back as Mary Pickfords last silent film 1927s ""My Best Girl"" and the 1930s radio serial ""Our Gal Sunday.""But as director Sam Taylor-Johnson (who dealt with the early years of John Lennon in ""Nowhere Boy"") understands given that traditional barriers to romance like differences in status in race in religion have been all but obliterated ""Fifty Shades"" both book and novel has to posit a new kind of difficulty that can keep loving couples apart. Photos Snapshots from ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" starring Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan. So while Anastasia Steele (Johnson) yearns for the dreamy coupling of romantic equals Christian Grey (Dornan) contemptuously proclaiming ""I dont do the girlfriend thing"" insists on the dominant/submissive model of the BDSM world. Even the Cohens and the Kellys didnt have it this hard. Anastasia and Christian meet cute when she fills in for a sick journalist friend and agrees to drive to Seattle to interview him for the newspaper at Washington State University where he will give the commencement speech. (Naturally she snags a parking space right in front of the building; its that kind of a movie.)Shes a mouseburger of a college senior while at 27 a major whiz at telecommunications hes ""the worlds most eligible billionaire bachelor."" Weve seen just what that means in the films opening sequence which lingers as lovingly over Christians extensive wardrobe -- those suits those shirts those grey ties -- as it will later over his drop-dead apartment and snazzy private helicopter. The pornography of possessions is definitely alive and well in this production.Against all odds sparks fly between Anastasia and Christian during the interview to such an extent that the busiest man in the world tells his secretary to cancel his next meeting. Just imagineThough the audience having heard about the book presumably knows all about Christians sexual proclivities virginal Anastasia hasnt a clue even when he all but gives it away with lines like ""I enjoy very physical pursuits"" and ""I exercise control in all things Miss Steele.""Eventually as these two cant leave each other alone Christian tells Anastasia about his ""playroom"" an immaculate space filled with restraints whips and assorted bondage paraphernalia so tastefully arranged you expect to see it in a future issue of Architectural Digest.Anastasia being a sensible young person is less than impressed with what she calls ""the red room of pain."" But Christian with a dark secret in his past is nothing if not determined to make her part of his world and as they go back and forth about the submissive contract he wants her to sign discussions of sexual situations that cant be mentioned in a family newspaper tease us with a frisson of danger.What we actually see however though involving considerable female nudity in the 1960s soft core mold is mostly but not entirely more tame than the talk though Christian does exhibit a facility with elaborate knots that would impress a Boy Scout.""Fifty Shades"" encourages us to buy into this credulity-straining scenario because the actors go well together (casting director Francine Maisler did the heavy lifting) Dornans steely resolve facing off nicely against Johnsons engaging feistyness as each tries to make this cross-cultural relationship work on his or her own terms.But these pleasantries do not adequately prepare us for the inevitable moments when ""Fifty Shades"" is forced to go over to the dark side when Christians actions come to feel abusive and not consensual and the delicate balancing act this film has been engaged in comes crashing down. It was not exactly fun while it lasted but it certainly was better than where it ended up.-------------- ""Fifty Shades of Grey""MPAA rating R for strong sexual content including dialogue some unusual behavior and graphic nudity and for language.Running time 2 hours 5 minutes.Playing In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Literature Reviews Fifty Shades of Grey director Sam Taylor-Johnson finds R-rated sweet spot 5 OMG facts to know before seeing 50 Shades of Grey With possible sequels Fifty Shades of Grey could get more colorful Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad81deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-fifty-shades-of-grey-review-20150213-column.html,200,fiftyshadesofgrey25,fiftyshadesofgrey,latimes
"50 shades of bland Fifty Shades of Grey review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMovies50 shades of bland Fifty Shades of Grey reviewA pulpy sex novel becomes a surprisingly conventional romance as ""mommy porn"" phenomenon Fifty Shades of Grey slides onto the silver screen.By Peter HowellMovie CriticWed. Feb. 11 2015Fifty Shades of GreyStarring Dakota Johnson Jamie Dornan Eloise Mumford Jennifer Ehle and Marcia Gay Harden. Directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson. At GTA theatres. 124 minutes. 18AA pulpy sex novel becomes a surprisingly conventional romance as ""mommy porn"" phenomenon Fifty Shades of Grey slides onto the silver screen.The film is McKinky for the masses with lots of nudity (mostly female) but very little of the erotic punishment explored in the book.Article Continued BelowVainly seeking to reach the widest possible audience the makers of this exercise in banality stripped it of almost anything that could cause offence. In the phenomenon ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson step into the iconic roles of billionaire entrepreneur Christian Grey and curious college student Anastasia Steele.  (Chuck Zlotnick / Universal Pictures)  The sex scenes are so bland the film could almost be shown on aircraft as is. There are fragrance commercials with more bedroom heat than this. Curiosity will have Fifty Shades fans flocking to multiplexes this weekend but disappointment will in all likelihood be sending them home.Most problematic is the pairing of relative unknowns Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan as Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey the submissive/dominant duo of the story about a Seattle billionaire seeking to explore his violent sexual fetishes with a compliant female.She looks older and more experienced than the virginal college student of the E.L. James bestseller. He looks younger softer and considerably less menacing than the Olympian figure of purple prose described as having ""unfathomable grey eyes.""Those peepers prove to be all too fathomable as Dornan fails to convey real depth to his character. His Christian is just your regular mixed-up rich kid with life issues who doesnt yet realize the sting he feels upon his derriere when he gazes at Ana comes from Cupids arrow not a riding crop. The cat o nine tails he wields in his ""Red Room of Pain"" is one tame tabby and when he speaks of being ""bone-twitchingly mad"" at Ana for her disobedient behaviour he barely seems peeved.If this movie wasnt trying so desperately to shock and offend this alpha male versus feisty female conceit could be remounted as a screwball comedy. Something along the lines say of Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell in His Girl Friday or Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan in Youve Got Mail.Alas Fifty Shades of Grey also aspires to make a big weepy statement the familiar one about the good girl redeeming the naughty boy who swears he cant feel love but it fails in that regard as well. It sets up the story for multiple sequels rather than being a single satisfying movie.But its not a disaster. In fact director Sam Taylor-Johnson (Nowhere Boy) and screenwriter Kelly Marcel (Saving Mr. Banks) deserve considerable credit for turning James risible drivel into something resembling an adult romance if not a mature one. They had an almost impossible task trying to create a soft-porn romance that would arouse everyone while offending no one.Wisely dispensing with voice-over narrative theyve excised the ""holy crap"" and ""oh my"" expletives that litter Anas first-person account in the book (although Christians bizarre ""Laters baby"" remains). The movie also doesnt meander the way the book does although for those keeping score at home Christian doesnt administer his first spanking until the 140 mark of this two-hour tumble.Ana seems less of a little girl lost here in part due to Johnsons convincing performance although that annoying lip-biting habit remains and the dear lamb seems to have no idea what a butt plug is for.Taylor-Johnson and Marcel add humour the book lacks. They acknowledge the ridiculousness of the basic premise billionaire kinkster Christian constantly seeks and grooms BDSM recruits (Ana is number 16) insisting they must sign reams of documents vowing secrecy and obedience on terms that are strictly negotiated.The signing ceremony is amusingly lit like a sunset walk along the beach but rather than going barefoot in the sand Christian and Ana stroll their pens down a long list of ""wills"" and ""wonts"" with Ana very much the dominant voice on the ""wont"" side of the ledger.Its good that shes always shown to be in command of her own destiny no small matter at a time when the non-consensual violence allegedly perpetuated by Jian Ghomeshi and Bill Cosby against women is still very much top of mind.Its hard not to think of these two when Ana finally gets around to asking Christian the billion-dollar question ""Why do you want to hurt me?""The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

VPCThe film version of the insanely popular erotic novels is a dull listless affair with only Dakota Johnson mustering any life.Dakota Johnson stars as Anastasia Steele in ""Fifty Shades of Grey.""(Photo Universal Pictures and Focus Features)Story Highlights2 stars (out of 5)For a movie with so much sex it sure is boring.If only we had known the safe word to make it stop.Whats the sound of people swooning?It seemed that it might be possible to learn the answer while watching ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" -- the film based on the best-selling series of erotic novels -- with an audience. But two hours later nope. The sound of titters and outright laughter? Sure and lots of it (some of it even intentional). But swooning? Titillation? Excitement? Better look in another theater.So lets get down to brass tacks. Yes there are sex scenes in the film quite a few. But for a movie where people are naked for a large chunk of time and play at bondage and dominance (without ever really seeming all that committed to it) it sure is boring.But boredom is far from the only problem with director Sam Taylor-Johnsons adaptation of the E.L. James book. If you wanted to be overly generous you might even say that Taylor-Johnson working from a script by Kelly Marcel is simply moving slowly working patiently toward what everyone in the audience came for in the first place -- teasing perhaps.Or you might say is anything ever going to happen here? Erotic? Thats a foreign notion in this movie.Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) seduces Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) in a scene from ""Fifty Shades of Grey."" (Photo Universal Pictures and Focus Features)The film tells the story of Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson the best thing in the movie by about 10 miles) a 22-year-old virgin about to graduate from college who takes over for her sick roommate at an interview with billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan). It says something about the film that the abject implausibility of such a situation barely registers a blip so ridiculous is the rest of whats going on.We are meant to believe that sparks fly when the two meet but thats asking a lot when they have such lousy chemistry together. But lets give them the benefit of the doubt.Next thing you know Christian is sending Ana gifts and calling her and for lack of a better word stalking her. She is confused naturally. So too are the filmmakers and it wont be the last time. Her actions are confusing as are his. He wants her. But she should stay away. But he wants her. But she should stay away etc. etc. (Ana even makes a joke about it.)Before ""Fifty Shades"" 50 sexy films that raised ire eyebrowsSomewhere along the line Ana manages to graduate from college and Christian wants her to enter into a contract. Not for employment. For dominance -- and in her case submission. Theres a pretty funny scene when she goes over line by line the terms that she will not agree to. Surprisingly Christian goes along with all her requests.She wont sign it right away which of course infuriates but intrigues him. And the lack of a signature doesnt prevent them from going into his ""playroom"" anyway. Shes curious and willing to try things and he is eager to get to it.Then the confusion sets in again. The next day they seem happy enough with the way things went the night before but then THAT NIGHT at dinner with his family shes crying and complaining about how shes not allowed to touch him and why is he afraid of intimacy and whatnot. Its like a big chunk of the movie is missing (and Im certain I didnt fall asleep which might be another explanation for the tonal shift -- though anyone could be forgiven for doing so).There are reasons for Christian being the way he is but he wants to control access to that information the same way he wants to control everything else. Evidently the only real way Ana can burrow through to the truth is to truly submit to punishment. (A question Why?)Dornan plays Christian as a blank a cipher with a big wallet soulless apartment spiffy helicopter and larger-than-average collection of Samp;M toys. For all his money and his hang-ups theres nothing interesting about the guy.Johnson fares much better. Alone among the cast she seems to somehow clue us in to the fact that she realizes how absurd all this is while still working to create a real character. How good might she be you wonder in a better movie? Or maybe an insurance commercial?We can assume that Christian and Ana are in some way helping each other her helping him to get in touch with his feelings or whatever and him helping her to open herself to new experiences even if most of those involve being spanked.But the real sadism arrives at the very end of the film and it is breathtaking in its cruelty the promise of a sequel.Fifty Shades of Grey2 stars (out of 5)Director Sam Taylor-Johnson.Cast Dakota Johnson Jamie Dornan Jennifer Ehle.Rating R for strong sexual content including dialogue some unusual behavior and graphic nudity and for language.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

James Fifty Shades of Grey is such a dull decorous affair about as erotic as an ad for Pottery Barn. Yeah the book attracted 100 million readers in 52 languages. But the book sucked. I know there are three novels (Fifty Shades of Grey Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed)  but I only made it through the first one. Literary torture isnt my thing. But at least James suggested there might be something to learn from what connects a dominant and a submissive. (Only amateurs say ""sadist"" and ""masochist."") More News Real-Life Dominatrix Takes on Fifty Shades of Grey Sundance 2015 The Joys of Sleeping With Other People Watch Peter Travers Gag Over Januarys Worst Films 2015 Preview 68 Reasons This Year Will Rule All Stories >> Related Barely Legal 30 Nearly Pornographic Mainstream Films Full-frontal nudity steamy threesomes one-for-the-money shots -- these movies pushed the envelope and still played multiplexes Onscreen directed by a slumming Sam Taylor-Johnson (Nowhere Man) from a sanitized script by Kelly Marcel we have the story of a poor virginal English major -- one Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson). She finds the perfect man Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) a 27-year-old  techno-billionaire  hottie out to stop world hunger. Christian has a single flaw -- he gets off by blindfolding Ana tying her up in his Red Room of Pain cuffing her to the wall and flogging her. Whats a girl to do? According  to the romance-novel sympathies of this movie the answer is domesticate him into a normal guy wholl cuddle in the sack charm her parents and do her bidding. Whoops Now whos being the dominant? Instead of dinner and a movie Christian offers a contract that spells out how he wants to hold Ana in bondage with sex toys such as butt plugs and genital clamps. This being a consensual love story Ana says no to anal and vaginal fisting. Its quite the negotiation. Christian sweetens the deal by dressing her in high fashion supplying a computer (the Apple plugs are relentless) buying a sports car flying her around the Pacific Northwest in his chopper taking her hang-gliding and -- aww he cares -- gifting her with first editions of Thomas Hardy. Wheres the rough stuff? Since the filmmakers are basically remaking Twilight with spikes standing in for vampire teeth there isnt any. No need to lock up grandma. Director Taylor-Johnson shoots all this crotch nuzzling and nipple nibbling with the careful good taste of a headmistress with strict instructions not to let the naughty kids get out of hand. The soothing soundtrack purred and panted by the likes of Beyonce Ellie Goulding and Sia help the few sex scenes (most saved for last) play like vintage MTV videos -- all gloss no grit. The movie shies away from welts bruises and bodily fluids though we do get a quick peek at Christians junk while he spanks Anas naked ass to a blushing pink. If youre still with me and I dont blame you if youre not this kind of Cinderella porn is what substitutes for the books darker bloodier fantasies. Sorry pervs the tampon scene is gone Amazingly Johnson (The Social Network 21 Jump Street) the daughter of Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson and no relation to the director plays all this silliness as if she means it. Shes the one bright spot in a film that deals with sex by removing the joy of  it. Luckily Johnson suggests her mothers pert Working Girl mischief and gives Ana a core of feisty intelligence the book never hinted at. Sadly costar Dornan an Irish model-turned actor (hes quite good being bad on the BBC series The Fall) gives her a brick wall to act with. Either pulverized with fear or embarrassment Dornan seems to have no idea who or what he is playing.  Cant blame him Christian has no shades. Hes a human Ken doll with a kinky set of accessories that go unused. Dont want to frighten the little girls of all ages and sexes who will line up to see this sanitized swill. A few early reviews have given the film a pass because its not as dirty as advertised. They seem grateful. Im disappointed. Twisted me The true audiences for Fifty Shades of Grey are gluttons for punishment -- by boredom.

Novelist E.L. James erotic reveries read like the rantings of a drunk yokel -- less ""His firm hands cupped my breasts"" and more ""Holy crap Hes touching my boobs""The story is simple 21-year-old virgin Anastasia Steele is offered an opening to be cold-hearted tycoon Christian Greys sex slave. Before they sign a contract -- an actual legal document with an addendum for buttplugs -- they test the merchandise and each others emotional and physical limits. The smartest decision director Sam Taylor-Johnson made when adapting the novel for the screen was to throw out half of it especially her ingenue Steeles ""inner goddess"" a split personality that appears halfway through the book to grant the prudish college senior permission to screw the hell out of the hot rich guy. To get to the sex stuff readers had to suffer through such lines as ""My inner goddess is dancing the merengue.""Film Details Fifty Shades of Grey RatingR GenreDrama Running Time125 min. More Info Trailer On screen Taylor-Johnson and leads Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson seem embarrassed by the source material as though its an old high school friend theyre forced to invite along to a fancy dinner. Theyre fine with the tits -- its their middlebrow creator theyd rather cover up. The film strips Fifty Shades of Grey to its essentials a confident man an awkward girl and a red room rimmed with leather handcuffs. From there Taylor-Johnson rebuilds. She constructs an erotic dramedy that takes its romance seriously even as it admits that Christian Greys very existence is absurd.Grey is physically perfect unfathomably rich and inexplicably obsessed with the guileless Steele who per rom-com tradition first greets him while literally tripping over her own feet. Dornan plays him deadpan his eyes as cold and appraising as those of a shark debating the fleshiest part to bite. Early on asked about his hobbies he replies ""I enjoy various physical pursuits."" He never laughs even at his own double entendres but were allowed to laugh at him -- even though Dornan seems so uncomfortable that its unclear if hes in on the joke.

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm Steele was deliberately written as a blank -- a cheap Xerox of Twilights Bella Swan herself a thin audience surrogate. Dakota Johnson breathes life into her in tiny motions the way she leans in to Greys neck or dances like a fool to Frank Sinatra. Her Anastasia lives in the real world -- a place where Christian Greys are unicorns. Every time she looks at him we see her wonder ""Who the hell is this guy -- and why me?"" Shes a fantastic comedian with a voice that sounds like theres a feather duster lodged in her throat. When Grey growls that they cant fuck until he has her written consent Johnson pauses then croaks ""What?"" Johnsons Anastasia sees the lunacy of her situation. The only thing Johnson cant pull off is her characters over-dramatic name -- she introduces herself as Anastasia Steele like an apology.The irony of Fifty Shades is that Anastasia isnt passive. Shes a power bottom. In the book her resistance comes from being a stubborn prude. Here Johnson finds a slyer twist Anastasia can say no to Grey because shes not afraid of losing something she never expected to own like a gambler on a winning streak.Taylor-Johnson has a shrewd understanding of what turns women on. Take Christians toys all made of leather fur brass and feathers which line his sex lair like the accessories rack at Gucci. It works both as a display of wealth and skill -- only a connoisseur would need four different foxtails -- and as a tangible fantasy where we can imagine the weight and touch of every whip. Taylor-Johnson favors tactile close-ups that activate the senses Dornans knuckles gripping a desk Johnsons lips nibbling a pencil four shots of him clicking her into a seatbelt before they zoom off in a private plane. Every shot is a subliminal suggestion from the smooth parting of an elevator door to a quick insertion of Anastasia at her job at a hardware store coiling several feet of rope. The electric thrill of their first bedroom scene isnt Grey stripping off his shirt but how he lunges onto the mattress and without warning or apology bites into Anastasias toast.Taylor-Johnson isnt apologizing either for shooting a sex-positive movie where the woman doesnt end up dead. (Ahem Basic Instinct and Body of Evidence.) But James Fifty Shades trilogy is at heart puritanical. The books are credited with introducing dissatisfied women to bondage. Yet the thrust of the series isnt Christian Grey awakening Anastasia to the pleasures of submission -- instead its her convincing him that his sexual wants are wrong. She may temporarily thrill as he spanks her over his knee but the book-three climax is a wedding and a baby. The series savors kink and stigmatizes it implying Grey is into BDSM only because an older woman stole his virginity at 15 and his mother was a crack whore. Confesses Grey ""Im 50 shades of fucked up.""Its too bad that Taylor-Johnson cant give these insults a suspicious side-eye. She must mouth them as gospel since his Mrs. Robinson-like backstory villain factors in to the sequels. As a result the book and the film punish their fans. Yes this naughty stuff is hot -- but if you like it too much youre sick.Instead to James the real aphrodisiac is that this billionaire bachelor grovels for attention from a schoolgirl who bends him to her vanilla wills by offering and withholding sex. She gives him her virginity he buys her a car. Thats not modern -- its shockingly retrograde. What he didnt have 60 camels to offer her father?Under the covers Fifty Shades of Grey is even more square than Twilight where a teen girl begged her boyfriend to bone her and a werewolf fell in love with a baby.

In case further proof is required that movies have changed for the worse Valentines Day is no longer about flowers and heart-shaped candy boxes but a celebration of sadomasochism and twisted titillating sex. Exhibit A A gullible naive and inexperienced college girl in Vancouver goes ape for a handsome young billionaire in Seattle seeking a virgin to make his sex slave. Only a filmmaker of outstanding subtlety or a kinky provocateur with the powers of limitless exploitation could make the most of this premise. Unfortunately Sam Taylor-Johnson doesnt remotely succeed in Fifty Shades of Grey the doomed movie version of the trashy best seller by E.L. James that made dildos as coveted an item on every Cosmo girls back-to-school list as yoga pants. The movie dead ends just like the book and for anyone who has ever seen a real porno film its tame as tapioca. But for its target audience (giggling girls and horny frustrated anti-feminists) its a great gimmick for selling exotic sex toys and lubricants. FIFTY SHADES OF GREY  (2/4 stars) Written by Kelly Marcel Directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson Starring Dakota Johnson Jamie Dornan and Luke Grimes Running time 125 min. Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) is a serious business major whose man-crazy roommate sends her off to interview the mysterious Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) for the campus newspaper. The result is a cliche-riddled flop for the journalism archives but a red letter day for the Marquis de Sade when the 27-year-old tycoon with his own office building named after him takes one look at the girl and spots his next victim. What pasty virgin would not be lured into a love affair with a GQ cover who pilots his own helicopter and plays Chopins ""Prelude in E Minor"" after a five-star dinner by candlelight? But there are problems. ""I dont do romance"" he warns. ""My tastes are very ... singular. You wouldnt understand."" Anastasia has no idea what he means and neither does anyone else. ""Enlighten me"" she says. In his lavish penthouse he beckons her to his decadent ""playroom"" filled with walls of assorted chains whips and a collectors gallery of other favorite ""floggers."" Appalled she flees. But naturally she returns even after he presents her with a detailed contract promising her unspeakable luxuries in exchange for total dominance if she becomes his coveted ""submissive."" Intrigued she says shes O.K. with bondage but anal torture is a no-no and she draws the line at vaginal clamps. Were off and running. Alas after more than two hours she still hasnt signed the contract but this is only Part 1 of a dreaded trilogy. Two more books and movies are on the way called Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed. I can only wonder if anything more stimulating will ever happen in the inevitable novels audiobooks Samsung tablet rebates and smarmy publicity campaigns that are forthcoming. The movie is lovely to look at and the sets and clothes are trendy and cool but for anyone seeking out a little action to go with the corny dialogue by screenwriter Kelly Marcel it is safe to say nothing ever happens here. Whoever photographed the sex scenes must have been thinking of puppy dogs and breakfast cereal. Fortunately the two heavily promoted leads are talented and pleasant though hardly enough to leave home for. As Anastasia Dakota Johnson can act and although Jamie Dornan from Belfast seems like an odd unnecessary choice to play an all-American corporate executive he looks good in and out of his pants. At the crowded screening I attended every time he unbuckled his belt the girls in the audience exploded with collective screams which I found somewhat baffling because instead of living up to the screenplays torrid description of Christian Grey as ""ridiculously hot"" Mr. Dornan is like dozens of other nice young junior stockbrokers on Wall Street. When he describes himself in a rare moment of confessional candor as ""50 shades of fucked up"" you want to yell ""Are you serious?"" Neither of the actors are ever out of handcuffs long enough to develop anything close to a real character and despite the overheated heavy-breathing publicity blitz surrounding the movie there is no full-frontal nudity. Still if word of mouth doesnt kill Fifty Shades of Grey the door is open at the end for more to come. Maybe in future installments there will even be something that resembles a plot. For now the entire movie is about as sexy as a root canal.

James erotic romance Erotica Fifty Shades of Grey jamie dornan kink Movies Romance romance novels Sam Taylor-Johnson Sex Entertainment News Dakota Johnson in ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" (Credit Universal Pictures) ""Behind this door is my playroom"" says buff blank and smooth billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) inflicting his Mount Rushmore gaze and flying-buttress hair upon wide-eyed and frizzy-haired Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) who seems naked and newborn even with her clothes on. Christian is walking Anastasia through his Seattle bachelor pad early in Sam Taylor-Johnsons lucid focused and almost antiseptic film version of ""Fifty Shades of Grey."" He lives - accepting for the moment the notion that he exists - in a high-rise sprawl of high-end consumer goods a luxury apartment with no hint of any individual personality beyond the unseen playrooms unspoken possibilities. Its a holographic representation of a rich mans life drawn from expensive but generic mail-order catalogs and suited to a character who seems projected from a 17-year-old girls daydreams Hyper-masculine loaded bored and in need of redemption not to mention unconvincingly non-gay.So thats where the Xbox is Anastasia suggests? With unless I imagined it a semi-demi-quiver of her lower lip suggesting that she suspects the answer is no? The answer is no. This scene is unconvincing for oh so many reasons but lets stick with one How the hell would Anastasia know what an Xbox is? She knows nothing about anything. She is a 22-year-old English major at a liberal arts college in Portland (Portland) so impossibly ingenuous that she has never heard of BDSM and is a virgin - not a feared-by-Republicans virgin who gives blowjobs but the real thing - and cannot envision what is signified by the term ""butt plug."" So shes a fan of ""Grand Theft Auto""? I dont think so. She was either born yesterday - fully grown and floating on the divine foam in a scallop shell - or she was teleported forward out of a Thomas Hardy novel. Or as I read Taylor-Johnsons take on the porn-romance bestseller by E.L. James (as adapted by ""Saving Mr. Banks"" writer Kelly Marcel) Anastasia is an angel fallen from heaven to suffer unendurable torment (or at least a few smacks on the ass) and so redeem a lost sinner. A lost hot sinner with piles of dough every kind of conveyance short of a magic carpet and no end of free time.I have more to say about that but lets cut to the chase. Yes Anastasia and Christian spend some time in that playroom together even in this pointedly inconclusive opening chapter of their story. It too turns out to be generic in its own way as if Christian had just sent his chauffeur to the neo-Victorian fetish boutique and bought out the entire stock. His supposed sexual expertise is a lot like his supposed job in an office tower with his name on the front of it where he hangs out all day with a bunch of leggy assistants out of a 1978 Helmut Newton photo shoot and plays Minesweeper on his MacBook or something. Its not remotely convincing and in some sense isnt meant to be.It would be overstating the cast to claim that Taylor-Johnson and Marcel go for a campy or satirical reworking of this material in the mode of ""Showgirls"" or ""American Psycho."" But there are more than a few notes of ambiguous ironic distortion throughout the movie more obvious when it comes to the Helmut Newton girls and less obvious in the sex scenes both ""vanilla"" and mild BDSM that comprise the main attraction. Whether viewers will find ""Fifty Shades"" arousing is of course an individual matter but I suspect it offers support for those critical theories about the difference between the male and female gaze albeit in complicated fashion. Theres no question that Taylor-Johnson (a British artist-turned-filmmaker and a woman) renders Christians elusive persona impressive physique and penumbra of consumer goods seen through Anastasias eyes as the focus of both power and desire.But I found the film purposefully anti-erotic and I dont mean because it was directed by a woman and is aimed first and foremost at female viewers. (You could say the same thing about Andrea Arnolds ""Fish Tank"" which will sear the eyeballs out of your head.) We certainly see a great deal of Dakota Johnson and/or her body double as Anastasia in the playroom scenes and its not as if Taylor-Johnson declines to objectify her. Visibly trembling with need while clothed Anastasia becomes virtually still when undressed and enmeshed in Christians literal ropes and metaphorical web. Her body is presented as a near-abstract study in shape and form an object of aesthetic contemplation more than lust. She is an exquisitely worked nude figure its perfection almost painful to behold rather than a representation of a person having an experience. Her curves echo those of Christians lamps and vases her perfect skin the perfect marble of his floors and counters and elevator doors. What Christian means when he says he wants Anastasia becomes abundantly clear.All that has virtually nothing to do with BDSM in the bedrooms of the real world - which is pretty far from being some emotionless acquisitive power game whether you approve of it or not - and a lot more to do with hoary conceptions of what men and women want from relationships. Anastasia wants cuddling and intimacy and movie dates and hot sex where shes the focus of attention and a stream of luxury gifts and trips to surprise destinations. Well why not? Christian wants to whip her and use her and then send her to bed in a different room. Im guessing he also wants not to have to remember when her damn birthday is but that doesnt directly come up.Christians problem is not that he has unconventional sexual appetites because in the universe of ""Fifty Shades"" those do not exist in themselves. He could not possibly find gratification in a dominant sexual role nor could he possibly find female partners who enjoy a submissive role. James is willing to titillate her audience by acknowledging that such practices exist and some people claim to like them but then must retreat to a position possibly more puritanical (and certainly more hypocritical) than simply ignoring them. Those people are of course mistaken and damaged and their so-called preferences are symptoms of sinfulness confusion trauma or abuse (which pretty much amount to the same thing). One could say such things are the work of the devil but in Christians case it can all be blamed on a wildly implausible back story involving a diabolical cougar ex-girlfriend. You Might Also Like Anyway dont let the name fool you What goes on in Christians playroom is deadly serious and the stakes could not possibly be higher - if we were in a 17th-century religious parable which in some respects we are. As in the stories about Don Juan or Faust Christian Greys legendary but less ripped great-grandfathers the contest is over a mans soul and Mephistopheles has his hooks deep in those meaty pecs. Whether she knows it or not Anastasias task is to pull Christian from his impeccably furnished upper-story version of the Slough of Despond the swampy mire of doubt fear temptation lust shame guilt and bottomless sinfulness described in John Bunyans ""Pilgrims Progress."" (The hero of that most famous of all English religious parables by the way is named - well youve guessed it by now or you knew it already.)Am I reading too much unintended meaning into a conventional romantic fiction one that happened to touch a cultural nerve by dabbling in some previously taboo erotic fantasy? (Lets set aside the question of how taboo or unusual any aspect of BDSM-related sexual practice or fantasy could possibly be two centuries after the Marquis de Sade and two millennia after Caligula.) Well sure. The ""Pilgrims Progress"" parallel might be coincidence and I dont know of any direct evidence that James means ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" as a religious allegory. To no ones surprise the guardians of Christian morality have been scandalized by her books. (They had no idea about butt plugs either. Until now) But to borrow a word from Thomas Hardy Anastasias fave literary author religious meaning is immanent in the romance novel and entirely obvious in the vampire novel in which the soulless but irresistibly seductive demon lover ravishes the innocent virgin.""Fifty Shades of Grey"" began in emulation of Stephenie Meyers ""Twilight"" series whose plausible spiritual lessons are closer to the surface. So far as we know Christian Grey is not immortal and doesnt drink blood but he has a dark secret that renders him unlike other men and lends him fearsome erotic power. Dornan an Irish-born actor and former Calvin Klein model supremely skilled at that hunky-guy-pulling-off-shirt maneuver was previously best known for playing a serial killer on the series ""The Fall"" and he brings the same inscrutable and almost inhuman intensity to Christian. As almost everyone whos ever written about James books has observed Christians Uber-stalker behavior would send up multiple red flags in real life He spies on Anastasia has her followed pursues her across the country to interrupt a private meal with her mom and even steals her car and sells it. (Unlike the bad boyfriend who would do that and keep the money he replaces it with one thats much more expensive and obnoxious.) So he could be a rich psychopath with armies of assistants and limitless technology or he could have supernatural powers. Either way its evidently what girls like.Oh wait - except they dont. That is they do but they dont. Its so confusing Christians obsessive and possessive pursuit of Anastasia along with his desire to punish and dominate her in the playroom represent attention she craves delivered in much larger doses than she wants. Like Edward Cullens propensity for drinking blood they stand for the untrammeled masculine Id which not so secretly yearns for the powerful feminine superego that can master it. As antediluvian as these sexual politics are - woman as civilizing force lion tamer and holy redeemer -- Dakota Johnson captures Anastasias awakening from angelic innocence to worldly experience in witty and compelling fashion. She moves rapidly from woozy lip-biting enthrallment (not to mention unconditioned split ends) toward a sleeker and more calculated performance of need and desire and command - the performance of femininity in other words -- which incorporates the understanding that the real power struggle is not happening in the playroom.I wouldnt say that Taylor-Johnson has made a good movie from ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" precisely. Thats asking too much. But she and Marcel have risen to the challenge of this bizarre cultural moment with an odd and memorable film one that pulls elements of archetypal fable -- Don Juan defeated by true love; Faust rescued from Mephistopheles - out of an incoherent gender-war Rorschach test with no plot. On its surface the ""Fifty Shades"" movie is a depthless pornographic fantasy as superficial and thunderingly empty as Christian Greys enormous head or the echoing halls of his apartment. Beneath that surface lies the buzzing life force we feel within Anastasia the force of desire at war with itself. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

Photo Universal Pictures The eagerly awaited/dreaded film adaptation of the best-selling BDSM romanceA Fifty Shades of GreyA is nowhere near as laughable as you might have feared (or perversely hoped for) Its elegantly made and Dakota Johnson is so good at navigating the heroines emotional zigs and zags that you want to buy into the whole cobwebbed premise. The movies biggest surprise is its powerful affirmation of family values. ItsA Jane EyreA with ropes. That this vanilla bean has been denounced by religious decency brigades while female churchgoers pleasure themselves over advance tickets is further proof of Americas insane cultural bifurcation -- or trifurcation if you count the worriers who predict that womens shelters will have to add more beds to accommodate battered copycats. Are there really people who still think that watching a man tie up a woman and both of them get off is the gateway to hell? Not being a masochist I couldnt bring myself until recently to read the first book in E.L. Jamess trilogy which began (and should have ended) as fan fiction. A few pages was all it took to grasp that the shy virginal narrator-heroine Anastasia Steele needed to be liberated from her mousy introversion and the sleek chill billionaire Christian Grey from his anger toward women -- one hopes by the love of an independent lass willing to meet his demand for submission partway (but only partway). Anastasia and Christian are literally made to rescue each other. The setup is not dramatically speaking virgin territory. A successful male control freak whos compelled by an emotionally pure woman to open himself up is the basis for thousands of romances and is far less disturbing in its implications than say Pretty Woman that launching pad for American Sweetheart Julia Roberts in which the prince purchases his princess on the open market. Here the characters names say it all A vulnerable princess with a core of steel(e) meets a morally gray prince who is first and foremost Christian. Not-untalented not-unsophisticated people have swallowed hard and labored to make these cliches seem fresh. It couldnt have been easy. Johnsons Anastasia begins as a bookish ingenue with slumping shoulders and bangs that hang limply over her cast-down eyes. Having been enlisted by her flu-ridden journalist roommate to come to her rescue by interviewing the forbidding Mr. Grey Anastasia is ushered into a high-in-the-skyscraper office by a tall crisp blonde in an expensive suit. Seeing Grey she gets tingly all over. He is not merely Master of the Universe but an Adonis to boot. Theoretically at least. Jamie Dornan a last-minute replacement after Charlie Hunnam left so fast that the revolving door must have flapped for days cuts a less commanding figure than youd hope so the first look between Anastasia and Grey is a nonevent. With his fluffed-up hair and pert pretty little face Dornans Grey looks more like a natural bottom than a top. Hes a bantamweight. Although I did grow to appreciate his modest unshowy acting its clear hes not sending much heat her way and that shes having to work herself up in a vacuum -- at a cost to her psyche judging from her glassy PTSD demeanor in television interviews. Whatever she went through Johnson is superb. The daughter of Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson she resembles neither one. Her gift (which her mother had before all the shtick and plastic surgery) is for achieving emotional transparency while looking nothing like a trained actress. But the craft is there. Johnson doesnt so much speak her lines as float them removing the sharp notes so that Anastasia can seem both intelligent and strangely unassertive -- the sort of smart unformed woman whod be irresistible to a man with a compulsion to dominate. The most original and entertaining parts of Fifty Shades of Grey are the pre-coital negotiations. Christian hands Anastasia a long contract the details of which have been hammered out by the kind of lawyers that you and I will never be able to afford; and Anastasia strikes out clauses and then announces after all the niggling that she needs to go home and think a bit more. Her non-surrender is the key to movies dramatic tension but also alas its libido-killing pace. My God this thing goes on. By the time the two get busy in Christians ""playroom"" the oomph has gone out of the whole erotic setup the focus having shifted to the happiness of Greys mom (Marcia Gay Harden) at finally being allowed to meet one of Christians girlfriends as well as Christians decision to do what he never does with a submissive take her on a ""real date."" How you respond to those ""playroom"" scenes will depend on many factors from your gender to your sexual predilections to the depth of your experience. Anyone who has dabbled even casually in Samp;M will find Fifty Shades of Grey cruelly mild though a few might get off on knowing that in the theater next door the kiddies are watching SpongeBob. Given the preponderance of female nudity and absence of pickle shots we hetero males probably get the better deal -- which is too bad given that the director Sam Taylor-Johnson is a woman and ought to have a more female-centric perspective. Its not that she employs the usual prurient male gaze. Its that her own gaze is as nervous as her heroines. She seems shackled (so to speak) by the movies takeaway that even mindful ultraregulated BDSM isnt for normal people but emotional basket-cases -- damned souls -- who need to hide behind prescribed roles and rituals. This is not in other words a film for those who believe that an interest in dominance and submission is -- as long as no one gets seriously hurt -- healthy. Its for people who are titillated by BDSM but feel ashamed of themselves (or our culture being singularly screwed-up are titillated by feeling ashamed of themselves). Cocky confident Christian is actually in hell. When for the sake of healing him Anastasia pleads with him to show her what he really wants to do his predictable demonstration sends her reeling retching weeping into his private elevator. What did she expect? Perhaps James finds a middle ground in parts two and three of the Fifty Shades of Grey ""trilogy"" which will be made into movies assuming Johnson can be induced to put up with Dornan two more times. (Sadists might find the actresss evident pain more exciting than the characters.) Meanwhile newscasters and talk-show hosts will squirm through discussions of BDSM with the knowledge that hordes of churchgoers are massing at the doors everyone reliably missing the point that in a country where almost every movie features a hero racking up serial-killer-worthy body counts its a little slap and tickle that draws the most blood.

Boy likes girl. Boy asks girl to be his sexual submissive. That kinky love story sparked a best-selling phenomenon -- but its adaptation is a limp bore. In no order here are 50 reasons why 1. First off I get it. This flick isnt intended to be a polished work of high art -- you just want an escapist night out. But its not fun enough to be enjoyed over popcorn or emotionally charged enough to be taken seriously. Its not even campy enough make it a future cult classic. Its just mediocre. The most damning fate of all. PHOTOS Dakota Johnsons red carpet style 2. Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) is a virginal soon-to-be college grad sent to interview 27-year-old billionaire benefactor Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) in Seattle in place of her sick roommate. (Fine this isnt a problem. Just need to need to get the premise out of the way.) 3. As soon as Ana bites her lower lip Mr. Grey decides to pursue her. Yet the banter is so awkward that youre more likely to be entranced by his sleek office aesthetics. 4. Author E L James wrote her novel from Anas awestruck perspective. On the big screen our leading lady cant internalize. 5. ...And though Johnson does a nice job at conveying the characters sweet vulnerability shes cant quite show the range of required emotions. 6. Christian Grey has piercing gray eyes. James noted this roughly 87 times. Dornans eyes are just a fine shade of blue. 7. Ana ""I wouldnt look at me."" Christian ""I am."" PHOTOS Fifty Shades steamiest pics 8. Christian shows up at the hardware store where Ana works and she literally shows him the ropes. She doesnt think this is weird. 9. He buys her a rare edition of her favorite book. She doesnt think this is weird. 10. After Ana drunk-dials him from a club he saunters in from Seattle and takes her back to his hotel room. She doesnt think this is weird. 11. Were not even at the sex yet. 12. The bland supporting actors from her roommate to his fixer disappear halfway through the film. Not that theyre missed. 13. Christian ""What is your thing?"" Ana (whispering) ""Books."" 14. Christian finally deflowers Ana in a darkly lit scene meant to be scintillating. Brace yourselves Its more sterile than a doctors office. PHOTOS Celebrity sex confessions 15. People in the audience snickered. 16. Dornan and Johnsons lack of passion is criminal to the point where their screen test must be sent to the labs and dusted for fingerprints. 17. The actor may have a sick chiseled body but he looks uncomfortable playing a psychologically and physically scarred alpha male. 18. Christian ""F--- the paperwork."" 19. His American accent. Sorry dont buy it. 20. Truth Johnson was more flirtatious in bed with Justin Timberlake during her lone scene in The Social Network. 21. Instead of dinner dates Christian asks Ana to contractually agree to be whipped and chained in his Red Room of Pain. This serves as the remainder of the plot. 22. She thinks this is only moderately weird. PHOTOS Best TV couples 23. Christian ""I would like to bite that lip."" 24. The stilted and cheesy dialogue. 25. Granted the Twilight saga also featured the same hackneyed dialogue and star-crossed courtship. At least Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart brought the heat. 26. After one roll in the sack they slow-dance to a Frank Sinatra song. This is neither the time nor place for a Nora Ephron homage. 27. Christian buys Ana a new laptop and car. She doesnt think this is weird. 28. Would Charlie Hunnam have made a better Mr. Grey? Or perhaps Alex Pettyfer? Or Ian Somerhalder? Its all too easy to play casting agent during the movies long stretches of dullsville. 29. For example theres no need to include Anas hometown visit to Georgia to see her mom. 30. Or watch Ana and Christian fly in a drone. 31. Or watch Anas mom give her daughter earnest relationship advice. If mama only knew 32. Marcia Gay Harden a bona-fide Oscar winner is wasted in the thankless part of Christians mom. 33. Why is Ana using a flip phone? 34. Christian ""If you agree to be my submissive Ill be devoted to you."" PHOTOS Most romantic movies ever 35. Christians method of wooing from the piano playing to the aerial rides is straight out of the Pretty Woman playbook. 36. Christian doesnt have a trace of a sense of humor. All girls enjoy a sense of humor. Its a fact. Look it up. 37. Ana meanwhile is dryly sarcastic and nurturing. She could have Tindered a guy more compatible for her easy. 38. Does Ana ever plan on signing this contract? Get on with it girlfriend 39. The running time is 122 minutes. Boyhood was only 44 minutes longer. That film spanned 12 years. 40. Christian I dont make love. I f--- Hard."" 41. Swaths of Christians backstory -- including details of his tragic childhood --have been discarded. 42. Because of this he comes off more like a creepy cipher than a lost soul. 43. The most erotic scenes between our two leads are also cut from the book. Two words silver balls. PHOTOS Fifty Shades stills 44. The Samp;M piece de resistance set to a slow-jam version of Beyonces ""Crazy in Love"" is cut and spliced together like a music video. 45. And its a bigger Seattle letdown than Super Bowl 49. 46. Beyond the raunch nothing here will convince audiences that this unlikely pair belongs together. 47. Anas declaration of love is overwrought and disingenuous in a sequence meant to be heart-wrenching. 48. The er climax. Its not satisfying. 49. Christian ""Im fifty shades of f---ed up"" 50. Two sequels have already been announced So lets shut this door and hope the ensuing outings are more...pleasurable.

""50 Shades of Grey"" is an S/M romance about a fabulously wealthy dominant man named Grey who makes a pretty young woman his willing submissive. So already you can see how original the new story is. I mean with the changed vowel and all. But heres another difference. Silly as it could be the first movie was beautifully photographed and ripely sexy. The second is just a little wan and pale and cautious. Its more like ""50 Shades of Beige."" It has a small beating heart though and thats Dakota Johnson. The child of Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson and grandchild of Tippi Hedren - pretty decent gene pool there - she has her mothers baby face and her own open emotional eagerness. As hard as it is to believe this character Anastasia Steele - a perfectly blank 21-year-old virgin who signs up to be the sex slave of a man who keeps a ""red room of pain"" and is named Im afraid Christian Grey - Johnson almost makes it possible. But then we get to Jamie Dornan who has a house as beautifully empty as his expression and prowls its rooms late at night like an only slightly darker Bruce Wayne. The Adam West version too. The whole things about as transgressive as ordering a Cabernet Sauvignon with your fish. Were told early on that Anastasia is an English major with a particular love of Hardy. Too bad. What the movie really needs is a good dose of Bronte - a tall dark lover with a scowl like a thundercloud and lots of passionate back-and-forths on the edge of rough cliffs. Instead we get the damp afternoons of the Pacific Northwest Harlequin Romance names and a character who doesnt so much seem deliciously kinky (the movie deep in its own fantasy never shows him raise so much as a welt) as he does a dangerously obsessive stalker. Really next to him the controlling Edward of the ""Twilight"" movies comes off like some nice bearded vegan with a degree in womyns studies. The sex scenes all stay safely within the parameters of R (and also typically expose more of the woman than the man). Theyre not photographed or edited in any particular interesting way and theres no sense of mystery or anticipation. Nor is there any attempt to make any more of this than a giddy vicarious fantasy. Surely theres something that could be done with the contrast between what Christian does for fun with Anastasia (helicopter rides glider flights soaring free) and what he does for pleasure (ropes cuffs bondage). Maybe we could find just the tiniest bit of poetry among the soft-core sex? But why waste the time? Quick Robin to the porn cave Of course this story - nice young innocent submits to nice young pervert - has its own audience. Heaven knows millions of readers werent buying those books for the awful writing. (E.L. James didnt just wrestle with her sentences; she got them in a headlock and made them eat grass.) And perhaps this movie will find those hard-core fans. But from the somewhat shocked and mostly disappointed laughter I heard when the film abruptly ended - true to the book by the way but completely unsatisfying - I felt like I was the one whod been teased and pushed around for two hours. And I didnt even have a safe word. Oh wait yes I did. ""Enough."" Ratings note The film contains nudity sexual situations sexual violence alcohol abuse and strong language. Fifty Shades of Grey (R) Universal (125 min.) (R) Universal (125 min.) Directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson. With Dakota Johnson Jamie Dornan. Now playing in New Jersey.

Photo Credit Universal Pictures and Focus Features advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT An inexperienced young woman meets a wealthy man with a bondage fetish. BOTTOM LINE Despite the endless sex a highly unsatisfying encounter. Cold as a fish and almost as dumb. CAST Dakota Johnson Jamie Dornan Marcia Gay Harden LENGTH 202 A pretty young virgin gets a taste of the lash in ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" the big-screen adaptation of E.L. James best-selling novel about a bondage-driven romance. Its big all right The movie plays in supersize IMAX this Valentines Day weekend. As Anastasia Steele the films frequently dumbstruck heroine might say ""Holy cow"" You might be equally agog at how an R-rated film full of kinky sex and dirty talk could be so painfully dull. ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" stars a fetching Dakota Johnson as Anastasia a college student pining for romance and Jamie Dornan as Christian Grey the handsome billionaire with a riding-crop fetish. The actors are attractive and we see just about every naked inch of them. Despite all the waist-down action though the movie has no pulse. Whats more its dead from the neck up. advertisement | advertise on newsday The blame begins with James artless witless source material which began its literary life as a work of ""Twilight"" fan fiction. That explains the storys Northwest setting Seattle and the maddening way its adult characters behave like dopey teenagers. Grey a vaguely defined ""businessman"" is an unconvincing mix of Regency aristocrat and high-school hunk while Anastasia is another Bella Swan (""Twilight"") though with even bigger daddy issues. ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" pitches itself as a story of sexual awakening and dark desires. Grey incapable of intimacy wants Anastasia to sign a contract submitting to various thrashings; Anastasia however wants to cuddle too. This emotional tug-of-war sometimes involves literal rope but the argument quickly grows tiresome (Kelly Marcel wrote the screenplay a thankless job). Just as boring are the sex scenes which -- lets face it -- are the only reason you might show up. Director Sam Taylor-Johnson brings a strangely dry and sanitized feel to the bedroom collisions (blue lighting pop songs) which never get much kinkier than ice cubes and peacock feathers. Neither the book nor the film has the guts -- or perhaps the brains -- to acknowledge Anastasias basest desire money. Whenever shes unsure about taking another beating Grey buys her a car or shows her his enormous helicopter. It works too. Now thats the true meaning of domination.

Author E L James may not be much of a prose stylist but she can write an effectively dirty hot easy-to-read complicated-to-accessorize sex scene when she puts her mind to it. James throws in descriptions of bondage submission foreplay cosmic orgasms private helicopters and fine white wine. And minus the boring bits about private helicopters and tedious wine -sipping its all tatty arousing fun. Mind-boggling book sales for James enthusiastic efforts especially among mature self-actualized women suggest that I am not alone in my private enjoyment of such engorged erotic semi-literature. The movie Fifty Shades of Grey is considerably better written than the book. It is also sort of classy-looking in a generic TV-ad-for-bath-oil way. Dakota Johnson who plays the virgin English-literature major Anastasia Steele and Jamie Dornan who plays Christian Grey the wildly rich and sexually...particular business titan who wants Miss Steele in his playroom are exceedingly attractive actors with enviably supple bodies well suited to nakedness. And really under the circumstances movable parts matter more than acting skills. The production is also oddly sedate--the most polite aspirational romance between a screwed-up prince and girlish princess ever to include loving close-ups of dominance-and-submission sex toys. Presumably the look-but-dont-pant tone of the storytelling was negotiated among the books author director Sam (as in Samantha) Taylor-Johnson screenwriter Kelly Marcel and various producers and studio types; the movie version appears to be aimed at a younger consumer crowd than -the readers (albeit a crowd qualified for R-rated entertainment). In any event the result is confounding leaving both those coming to the Fifty Shades phenomenon for the first time as well as those who have read the book to wonder for different reasons Wheres the beef? I dont think this is entirely the inevitable result of coaxing an R-rated movie out of an X-rated book. True nobody in the movie has visible genitals; Christian in particular seems to do a whole lot of stuff in the playroom with his shirt off but his pants on which cannot be comfortable for such an active young man. But even more frustrating to voyeurs nobody sweats nobody strains nobody loses control or even fakes losing control by simulating an orgasm. Also--and this is a turnoff--every time a sex scene comes on some lady starts singing a big whooshy Sex Scene song. Hello Beyonce Ellie Goulding Sia Jessie Ware Skylar Grey. On the other hand when dressed the two stars look clean smartly groomed and ready for their fashion-magazine tie-ins. Johnson with her indefinably French look a la Charlotte Gainsbourg is particularly lovely conveying a welcome flash of wit and self-awareness missing from the book. (Not once in the movie does Anastasia say ""Holy crap"") The production design subtly reinforces the title in everything from the color gradations of the sky to the wardrobe of the sleek office babes on Christians payroll. Its a kick to see the fine actors Jennifer Ehle and Marcia Gay Harden play the young couples respective mothers. I spoil nothing by reporting what readers already know that when Fifty Shades is not a dirty story it is as the trilogy unfolds a study in cartoonishly weird family dynamics. Readers also know the thrill of secret arousal--the power to privately reread the scenes that get their motor running (or helicopter flying) and skip the dull pages. This perfectly normal way of consuming erotica suggests that the movie Fifty Shades of Grey will work better as home entertainment when each viewer can race past the blah-blah about how well Christian plays the piano and pause on the fleeting image of the man minus his pants.

Clearly she went to the Kristen Stewart School of Acting.The two meet when Anastasia interviews Christian for her college newspaper in his corporate headquarters in Seattle. She trips and falls on her face upon stepping into his office. Maybe it was this less-than-graceful entrance that inspired Christians fixation with making Anastasia his next playmate in sadomasochism. After the interview Christian shows up at the hardware store where Anastasia works and buys masking tape cable ties and rope though he doesnt seem the handyman type.

He just wants to lure Anastasia to his ""red room of pain"" as she puts it -- a chamber outfitted with whips chains handcuffs and other bondage-related sex toys.Being of sound mind and intact virginity Anastasia doesnt take Christians proposition lightly which translates to dull scenes of her mulling things over. She goes over his elaborate contract with an eagle eye. Their tete-a-tete regarding the document held at his office with the lights dimmed is meant to be a sexy interlude full of suggestive overtures. Instead its laugh-out-loud ridiculous.USA TODAYFifty stars hope result is sexy and sensualDespite the blandness of their moments together Anastasia cant help but be seduced by this handsome billionaire who buys her expensive gifts orders her around and creepily appears when she least expects it. Its a perverted twist on a Cinderella tale. The film is being touted for steamy elevator sex scenes. Mostly however the pair just repeat each others names as elevator doors close. Dont expect passionate goings-on between floors. Lets just say it wont do for elevators what No Way Out did for the back seat of limos.USA TODAYFive burning questions about Fifty ShadesFifty Shades glamorizes sexual violence implying that women seek to be controlled. What goes on between consenting adults on equal footing is one thing but the power imbalance here is striking especially given that Fifty Shades and its two sequels were written by a middle-aged woman. Another woman Sam Taylor-Johnson directed the film and a female screenwriter Kelly Marcel faithfully adapted the novel to the screen. In the wake of rising rates of sexual assault on college campuses in the military and elsewhere its disturbing that the story features the naive but well-educated Anastasia seeking to overcome her aversion to being abused degraded and isolated just to please her man. USA TODAYNo Jamie Dornans wife wont be seeing his bum in Fifty ShadesWere supposed to believe Anastasia might be swayed to share Christians predilection for dominance and submission but Johnson doesnt convey much enthusiasm with her one-dimensional acting. What could have been provocative instead just feels like retro fantasy.Say what you will about the domineering Christian but at least he knows himself which is more than can be said for the suggestible blank slate that is Anastasia in this plodding inane and wretchedly acted movie. 4221 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDIN 116 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1DfWTIj",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/02/10/50-shades-of-grey-review/23154403/,200,fiftyshadesofgrey38,fiftyshadesofgrey,usatoday

James Manufacturer Fifty Shades of Grey Sex Toy Sales Bulging and Universal Is Turned On Fifty Shades of Grey Mania Spawns Pimping by Condom Company in Parody Spot (Video) Despite some missteps (and misunderstandings of the kinks it should be exploring) this adaptation of E.L. James bestseller will leave fans satisfied Since its publication four years ago the ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" books have sold over 100 million copies despite novelist E.L. James abysmal dialogue and perfunctory sex scenes -- a sales figure that suggests the trilogy is certainly doing something right. Heres my guess Like the ""Twilight"" franchise before it (which inspired the original version of James tale) ""Fifty Shades"" taps into the narcissistic but understandable fantasy of having some innate quality that makes the audience-surrogate character the romantic and sexual obsession of a man who just happens to be handsome intelligent wealthy and generous. After years of being told they arent ""good enough"" -- girls and women are constantly pressured to be prettier cooler nicer to Smile -- a man finally comes along and proclaims that everything that she already is is so fantastically desirable that shes all he can think about. Oh and he wants to worship her for being so awesome by giving her lots and lots of orgasms. Also Read Fifty Shades of Grey Shocker 10 States Most-Obsessed With the Jamie Dornan-Dakota Johnson Movie (Exclusive) That ""Fifty Shades"" is a mega-blockbuster then is no surprise. The stylish and mostly satisfying film adaptation by director Sam Taylor-Johnson (""Nowhere Boy"") will be too and deservedly so. Starring a vivacious Dakota Johnson and a game Jamie Dornan Taylor-Johnsons erotic romance is a skillful distillation of James first book that captures the heady exhilaration of being someones fixation. Enjoying a belated coming-of-age is college grad Anastasia Steele (Johnson) a mousy but charming naif who meets aloof billionaire Christian Grey (Dornan) through an interview for her school newspaper. She trips into his office and looks up at his standing figure on her hands and knees. (Subtle the film is not.) Also Read Fifty Shades of Grey Shocker 10 States Most-Obsessed With the Jamie Dornan-Dakota Johnson Movie (Exclusive) Instantly smitten Christian pursues her until she ends up in his bed -- but only because she drank too much the night before. Over hangover-eliminating toast the next morning Christian makes his intentions clear he wants to become her Dominant but not her boyfriend and hed like her to sign a contract that will dictate the parameters of their sexual play. Once Ana and Christian get together theres not much more to the story its mostly PWP or ""porn without plot"" as its called in fan-fiction jargon. (The softcore scenes are tasteful but decidedly sensual.) And yet screenwriter Kelly Marcel smartly contrasts Anas erotic submission in Christians gorgeous sex dungeon with her ongoing resistance to actually signing the contract a move that leaves open the possibility for her to negotiate a more open and emotionally vulnerable relationship with her new bedroom partner than what he initially imagined. That negotiation is literalized in the films best scene in which a newly confident Ana sits in Christians conference room to discuss the terms of their contract finally proving that shes no longer willing to take it lying down anymore pun intended. (The films Ana -- funny smart always quick with a quip -- is a vast improvement from the self-hater in James book.) Theres also a grown-up drama hinted at in the script under-explored here but perhaps to be elaborated on in the two sequels that have already been greenlit about a couple that cares for each other but are forced to confront their sexual incompatibility since the further Ana concedes to Christians sexual wonts the less satisfied she becomes. Also Read Size Matters Fifty Shades of Grey Gets Last-Minute IMAX Release Despite the condescending snark and ridicule the books and the movie has received for supposedly introducing Samp;M to soccer moms ""Fifty Shades"" is certainly not the sexually progressive story it could be. Christians sexually dominant tendencies are related to his mysterious but tragic past the implication being that only damaged weirdos are into BDSM. That correlation is not only demeaning but also represents one of the films most tonally discordant and melodramatic moments. Unfortunately the obscure details of Christians past serve as a bridge to the next two movies which are set up through an abrupt cliffhanger that ultimately renders this film simply a hastily wrapped-up prelude to whatever comes next. ""Fifty Shades"" doesnt exactly leave me panting for more but it certainly knows how to keep a girl happy during its running time. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Photo Universal Pictures MOVIE REVIEW Fifty Shades of Grey Running time 124 minutes. Rated R (sex language violence). In theaters Thursday night. Ladies start your engines ""Fifty Shades"" is here just in time for Valentines Day. Roses are red and so is the X-rated playroom of  bondage-loving billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) in this steamy cheesy adaptation of the best-selling novel by E.L. James. Gone are the truly dreadful aspects of the book and the biggest surprise may be that Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) and Grey have developed senses of humor. Still the film never pretends to be other than what it really is soft-core porn for the ladies diluted with an ""R"" rating. Its a timeless story the one about the naive young woman and the wolfish seducer. Hes Mr. Grey model-handsome CEO of a large and vague corporation; English major Anastasia filling in for her ailing journalism-student roommate Kate (Eloise Mumford) comes to interview him for their college paper literally falling through his office doorway in her cartoonish clumsiness. Hes complicated we can tell -- hes hung a giant framed Rorschach blot in the hallway uh-oh -- but he takes a shine to Anas unvarnished honesty. Soon hes showing up at her job in a hardware store slyly asking for help finding cable ties and rope. (""Youre the complete serial killer"" she chirps in what may or may not be a nod to Dornans chilling role on the BBC show ""The Fall."") No hes not a murderer -- he just has ""very singular tastes"" as he puts it when he gives Anastasia a fat contract asking her to become his legal sex slave. (Christians big on paperwork; for their first date he serves her a glass of white wine and a nondisclosure agreement.) The inscrutable Dornans a pretty good fit for control-freaky Christian though he cant keep that Irish lilt out of his lines. Johnson for her part makes Anastasia less annoying than the golly-gee-whiz hayseed she is in the book. Her character round-shouldered in her schlumpy cardigans has some backbone -- she even drunk-dials Christian at one point razzing him as ""Mr. Fancypants."" Photo Chuck ZlotnickTheres been some buzz about the lack of chemistry between Johnson and Dornan but most of their trysts have a decent amount of heat. Dornan however is not a natural smiler and in an early scene in which he deflowers Ana he looks downright grim-faced as he climbs atop. Whether or not this is appropriate to his romance-phobic character (as Im guessing some book fans might argue) its a little unsexy on-screen. And the massive success of the ""Fifty Shades"" franchise has made one thing abundantly clear Women want more sex in their media. Theyre not going to get as much of it here as in the novel but no matter -- its already quadruple the amount in any other mainstream movie women are likely to see this year and its all aimed squarely at them. Sure Anastasias spanked blindfolded tied to various pieces of furniture and smacked with a riding crop but there are no scenes -- outside of the films dark final act -- in which Christian the sadist is seen as enjoying any of it more than she is. Photo Chuck ZlotnickDirector Sam Taylor-Johnson and screenwriter Kelly Marcel have also done away with the cringeworthy parts of the novel -- no ""inner goddess"" references here -- and reduced Anastasias irritating verbal tic of ""Holy crap"" to one ""Holy f - - k."" Theres humor in some unexpected moments like Anastasia and Christian negotiating the terms of his dominant-and-submissive contract. (Im guessing most boardrooms would never encounter the kind of terms theyre flirtatiously tossing around ""Genital clamps? Absolutely not."") One bedroom scene in which Christians growling at Ana to ""say yes to being mine"" is hilariously interrupted by a voice outside the door ""Oh God"" he says ""its my mother."" (Shes Marcia Gay Harden who along with Jennifer Ehle as Anas mom and Victor Rasuk as her friend Jose we see only in briefest passing.) ""Fifty Shades"" is not without its howlers. More than once we find Christian mournfully playing the piano the instrument thats lazy shorthand for emotional depth. Anastasias constant refrain of ""Why wont you let me in?"" is a little too on the nose aimed as it is at a guy who maintains a locked ""playroom."" And Christians world is Rich Guy 101 all private air travel Champagne and bespoke suits. But none of this matters. Mr. Grey will see you now -- and Im betting record-breaking numbers of female moviegoers are ready to be seen.

However it ultimately speaks to a bigger force at work -- namely the absurd extent to which this unapologetically trashy source material has managed to hold sway over popular culture. READ MORE 6 Reasons Why Fifty Shades of Grey Will Rock the Box Office Lifted from the first of E.L. James wildly successful novels which started as a form of ""Twilight"" fan fiction the movie plays strictly by the book -- which is hardly a compliment. Directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson from Kelly Marcels screenplay the considerable talent behind the camera and a modicum of considerable performances yield a few undeniable guilty pleasures but most viewers will be seeking a safe word to escape this two-hour-plus mess of half-baked excess. Taylor-Johnsons previous directorial outing the John Lennon origin story ""Nowhere Boy"" similarly tracked a young character coming to grips with his identity. But while Lennon had real talent and ambition Anastasias only sincere desires involve whether or not shes willing to sign a contract allowing Grey to turn her into his object of fetishistic abuse. Johnson does her best to give Anastasias conundrum a genuine sense of intrigue and her final bits as she confronts Grey on the nature of his peculiar desires register some modicum of suspense. However the stilted Dornan doesnt even meet her halfway. But he cant be held entirely at fault for the paucity of material hes given and the extent to which the movie remains tethered to the books limited scope. Admirably enough Taylor-Johnson and the ever-reliable cinematographer Seamus McGarvey (""Atonement"") go great lengths to work around it. The drab Seattle setting takes on a haunting aura not unlike its ""Twilight"" inspiration; when Christian invites the befuddled Anastasia into his ""pleasure room"" the scene is bathed in an ominous red while their tender nighttime exchanges adopt a calming blue. One recurring motif finds Grey silhouetted against an expansive view of downtown from his palatial high rise at once celebrating his luxury and oddly trapped by it the sort of epic conceit that might seem at home in ""Citizen Kane."" But no amount of polished technical ingredients can salvage a relatively faithful screenplay that -- while skimping on some of the more outlandish sex scenes -- lifts much of the books painfully rudimentary dialogue verbatim. ""If you were mine"" Christian tells Anastasia early on ""you wouldnt be able to sit down for a week."" Such trivial moments are exacerbated by the extent to which ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" relies on its main protagonists unconvincing chemistry. Marcia Gay Harden lands a few enjoyably catty scenes as Christians demanding mother while Eloise Mumford does a competent job as Anastasias encouraging roommate but the movie predominantly operates as a two-hander. Filling in for her roomie on a college newspaper assignment to interview Grey at his office Anastasias immediately smitten with the cryptic figure despite his apparent resistance to open up. The sparks between them are obvious from the moment he confesses his desire to control everything in his life and she cant help but seem attracted to the suggestion. Moments later after drunk-dialing him from a bar Anastasias swooped up in an unruly series of encounters with the publicity-shy figure who confesses his desire for her before revealing his biggest hang-up If she wants him she has to sign a contract in which she agrees to his sadomasochistic urges. The second half of ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" revolves around Anastasias prevarications over Christians proposition even as their sexual chemistry continues to blossom. From the moment he takes her virginity in a softly-lit scene set to a swooning pop score the movie displays a willingness to show some skin for the sake of the titillation promised by the material while still very clearly holding back. The sex well-choreographed for what it is hovers on the verge of soft-core material but only offers fragments. With the books dirtiest sequences excised from the picture even the most extreme bedroom sessions amount to little more than a teaser trailer for the source material. Needless to say no amount of evocative images or elaborately-framed thrusts can save a story this blandly one-note. Christians silly backstory which pivots on his childhood as the offspring as a crack addict arrives on cue midway through the narrative to explain away his kinks as the depraved side-effect of a troubled youth. This context extends to the movies treatment of sexuality as a whole in darkly unappealing terms even as it advertises the opposite. In a welcome contrast ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" opens the same month as Peter Stricklands lesbian Samp;M romance ""The Duke of Burgundy"" in which the role-playing of its two lovesick leads ultimately builds to a warm conclusion. By contrast ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" is a maddeningly conservative affair. More than that it mostly avoids the prospects of giving its characters any real agency. Johnsons investment in the role only reaches its fruition in the tightly-directed climax when she manages to wrestle control of the situation. If the story ended there it might allow for a burst of transgressive energy largely invisible for most of the picture. But knowing that it arrives with the promise of more to come makes the overall experience even more execrable. Over a decade ago Steven Shainbergs ""Secretary"" bested ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" by using its setting to explore the intersection of private and personal experiences on modern sexuality. By now the concept registers as fairly hollow Christians a rich dude with some screwed up urges. Who cares? The movie fails to make a case for anything other than the idea that a sadomasichistic romance bolstered by affluent surroundings registers on the same shallow level as Christians luxurious existence. So it comes as no surprise that the more eccentric attributes of their sexual antics -- which involve everything from whipping and cuffs to a touch of ice cube foreplay -- barely give us more than glimpses of unimaginative kitsch. No matter its salacious reputation ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" retains an uninvolving quality to the proceedings. At one point Christian refers to his romance with Anastasia as ""fifty shades of fucked up"" but its actually quite routine. ""I dont make love"" he tells her. ""I fuck. Hard."" Despite all that ""50 Shades a Grey"" only goes surface deep. Grade C- ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" premieres this week at the Berlin International Film Festival.

And Jane Eyre is spelled incorrectly. And by all means please know Im not comparing the writing of EL James to Charlotte Bronte only in terms of using classic themes of romance. Reply Tinseltine May 12 2016 726 pm For me ""The Duke of Burgundy"" is slow pointless and dull. Where ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" is engaging and endearing. As much as I enjoyed the books as a guilty pleasure I too scoffed at its prosaic tones and thought of the book and the movie as icing. Then a friend pointed out to me that EL James wrote a classic romantic tale of a wounded man and innocent woman meeting and falling in love not unlike many such stories in literature - ""Jane Eyer"" for instance. Her words and a second screening of the movie opened my eyes to see past the icing to the cake. These two people want each other but need different things therefore the movie explores matters of trust and letting ones guard down. Why isnt that a enough for the movie to be about? The light BDSM and the over the top romantic gestures are entertaining ways to narrate this ""Rochester"" and this ""Jane"" finding their way. Reply Joe May 12 2016 726 pm Dee there is no such thing as a completely unbiased review. You seem pre-biased in favor of the book as are most of the people who gave this film a positive review.

""Directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson from Kelly Marcels screenplay the considerable talent behind the camera and a modicum of considerable performances yield a few undeniable guilty pleasures but most viewers will be seeking a safe word to escape this two-hour-plus mess of half-baked excess."" When you start the sentence with ""Directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson from Kelly Marcels screenplay"" the next thing you type has to be ""Fifty Shades of Grey."" Thats what was directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson from Kelly Marcels screenplay. Reply Elspeth Chagall May 12 2016 726 pm Dee its only a review. Get over it. Or are you one of those die-hard ""Grey"" fans? My condolencesp Reply Dantoni May 12 2016 726 pm Honestly Im going to have to sit through this with my Rub Maps girlfriend. I love her enough and its going to be Valentines Day. Reply Moeez May 12 2016 726 pm So the dirtiest scenes from the book are taken out but the super dumb dialogue is in? Oh man would love to see this for free for the bad delivery. Like The Room of erotic movies. Reply Danni May 12 2016 726 pm Insightful articulate and humorous in the right places. Unfortunate the film strays from what its lure was but what can we expect?? Its not the literary prowess thats selling tickets. Its the taboo nature of the relationship between the two characters Reply GM May 12 2016 726 pm I predicted this movie would be boring as the books are painful to read. Annas monotone whispery voice - I just couldnt possibly listen to that for two hours. The feigned virgin look is dull and painful to watch. James got lucky so many people have no idea what is good erotica. These two actors have no chemistry or individual sex appeal. Give me 9 1/2 Weeks with two sexy people who bring a lot of chemistry to the screen. Not even going to go watch this ridiculousness. Great review though Eric. Reply The Truth May 12 2016 726 pm Of course. The folks here on Indiewire has been dogging on Fifty Shades of Grey for weeks. Of course they were going to give it a negative review. Reply Dee May 12 2016 726 pm To Joe and ""Haver"" If either of you two morons have been actually paying attention to IndieWire in the months leading up to the release of Fifty Shades you would have noticed the condescending haterade filled commentary towards it and that the unwavering support of Secretary coincides with the re-release of Secretary in new formats which somehow was magically timed to release near Fifty Shades of Grey coming out as a film. The filmmakers of Secretary even changed the original cover art to show a brown haired girl with a gray tie falling down her bare back. What kind of bs is that? The original cover was fine and way more honest to the feature. Secretary and Fifty Shades are not the same story or the same film and I am tired of punks trying to make it seem like they are or make some far fetched comparison out of loyalty to the former. As far as getting annoyed with a review Haver (Punk) I dont like Mr. Kohns pre-biased review as it is disgusting and betrays the very field of which he pretends to be a part. Why dont you go be productive and grow a pair? Reply Lannychopper May 12 2016 726 pm I have seen a lot of good reviews but it is always nice to hear a different opinion. Reply Good Opinion Haver May 12 2016 726 pm Also great review Eric. Reply Good Opinion Haver May 12 2016 726 pm Dee stop getting angry at a Film Review on the internet. Go do something productive instead. Reply Joe May 12 2016 726 pm Dee the reviewer brought up a movie that dealt with similar themes and argued that one was more better. Reviews often do this. Sorry your toes have been stepped on. Reply Dee May 12 2016 726 pm Of course you dog Fifty Shades and then dare to bring up Secretary (and I love that movie) even though they are not even remotely the same bloody story. You should be ashamed of yourself. Turn in your credentials as a critic and admit whose pockets you really live in. Reply Joe May 12 2016 726 pm hahaha. YES. Good review Reply Susan June 7 2016 131 pm No matter which direction a review of Fifty Shades of Grey goes positive or negative never the train shall meet. That movie is done much to my disappointment. There have been scathing comments on the two leading actors as being well whatever ""clever"" degrading description can be assigned. I was very disappointed in the ""no holds barred"" evisceration of Jamie Dornan. In other performances Mr. Dornan has demonstrated his ability as an actor. I feel like if there had been a different director a better screenwriter and a special ""red room"" to store author EL James out of the way and out of the hair of the director and screenwriter things might have turned out differently for this movie. Jamie Dornan has shown his skills and he has been rewarded for his abilities by winning awards from IFTA and by nominations from other respected organizations for his performances in ""The Fall."" His intentions for Christian Grey were good but the script was lousy and the story was thin. The director and screenwriter were not given freedom to improve anything as the author was a huge interference. So the director and the screenwriter quit Would that Jamie and Dakota could have vacated their slots too But hopefully the new director James Foley can resurrect the next two movies in the trilogy. Ive noticed that ELJames has been off the set so maybe that will help. Excuses for bad reviews dont make the reviews fair so whats done is done. I feel really sorry for the ridicule that Jamie Dornan has endured and the same for Dakota. However Dakota has piled on a bunch of additional movies which helps her. Jamie has ""The Fall"" and hopefully some new releases for him can restore his battered being because he is a talented and capable AND A CREATIVE actor.

James novel. If the problem with too many literary adaptations is a failure to capture the authors voice then that shortcoming turns out to be the single greatest virtue of ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" the hotly anticipated first film inspired by E.L. James bestselling assault on sexual mores good taste and the English language. In telling the story of a shy young virgin and the broodingly handsome billionaire who invites her into his wonderful world of hanky-spanky director Sam Taylor-Johnson and screenwriter Kelly Marcel have brought out a welcome element of cheeky knowing humor that gradually recedes as the action plunges into darker kinkier territory. Glossy well cast and a consistent hoot until it becomes a serious drag this neo-""91/2 Weeks"" is above all a slick exercise in carefully brand-managed titillation -- edgier than most grown-up studio fare but otherwise a fairly mild provocation in this porn-saturated day and age. Still any movie thats generated a Lego trailer parody a 75-screen Imax rollout and countless sex-toy tie-ins is clearly filling a very special void in the zeitgeist and with its built-in female fan base and off-the-charts curiosity factor the Universal/Focus release looks set to flog the box office competition through Valentines Day and beyond. See MoreMeet Jamie Dornan the star of Fifty Shades of Grey The ""Fifty Shades"" trilogy may have first surfaced in 2009 as a work of ""Twilight"" fan fiction but it quickly distinguished itself as its own hugely successful thoroughly dubious pop-lit phenomenon (100 million copies sold and counting). A far cry from Stephenie Meyers pro-abstinence fantasy James startlingly explicit story proved massively popular with women of all ages ushering the taboo subject of bondage porn into the mom-friendly mainstream. And for all the deserved criticisms of Meyers prose style she really had nothing on James in that department as demonstrated by sentences like ""Desire pools dark and deadly in my groin"" and ""The muscles inside the deepest darkest part of me clench in the most delicious fashion."" Is it sadomasochistic longing or is it irritable bowel syndrome? At any rate it may partly explain why our heroine spends much of the movie looking not entirely in control of her lunch. A nervous dark-haired English literature student at Washington State U. Anastasia ""Ana"" Steele (Dakota Johnson) has been assigned to write a school newspaper article on Christian Grey a 27-year-old business magnate and university benefactor who turns out to be not just obscenely wealthy and successful but (as played by Jamie Dornan) impossibly good-looking to boot. Speaking with Ana in his glass-walled Seattle office Christian fixes her with the iciest of come-hither stares his cheekbones practically slicing through the narrative torpor. Ana for her part responds by looking quietly dazed with lust distilling the rich and complicated subtext of James novel -- oh my god hes so hot -- into a single oh-my-god-hes-so-hot expression. See MoreFifty Shades Wont Feature Infamous Tampon Scene Following their interview Christian and Ana heighten their mutual attraction with a few not-so-chance encounters. He sends her some rare first editions (happily not ""The Iliad"") hits on her at the hardware store where she works and eventually whisks her off to his apartment by private helicopter -- at which point James contemporary Cinderella story begins to reveal its Angela Carter side. Its not just that this American-psycho Prince Charming shuns conventional romance and conducts his relationships on a strictly transactional basis. As he notes early on Christian is a man of ""many physical pursuits"" which include piloting stalking topless piano playing and recreational bondage Specifically he selects and grooms young women willing to be bound gagged clamped lashed and probed for his pleasure and presumably their own. Imagine Bruce Wayne with a Red Room of Pain in lieu of a Batcave and youre more than halfway there. A self-described ""dominant"" Christian invites the naive sexually inexperienced Ana to be his latest ""submissive"" and hands her a lengthy contract outlining the very specific requirements and boundaries of their relationship -- ""the only sort of relationship I have"" he declares when she wonders why they cant just stick to dinner and a movie. In slowly easing Ana and the viewer into Christians private realm of decadence and deviance Taylor-Johnson and Marcel (who previously scripted that rather more tasteful dominant-submissive psychodrama ""Saving Mr. Banks"") reveal an unexpectedly deft and disarmingly irreverent touch wisely grasping -- more so perhaps than James and some of her more slap-happy readers -- that a film set in the leathery world of BDSM fetishism might not be without a measure of comic potential. Relying on the performances of two appealing fresh-faced leads with little prior onscreen baggage the filmmakers have turned their version of ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" into a sly tragicomedy of manners -- Jane Austen with a riding crop if you will or perhaps Charlotte Bronte with a peacock feather -- that extracts no shortage of laughs from the nervous tension between Anas romantic dream come true and the psychosexual nightmare raging just beneath the surface. By happily shedding the books 500 or so pages of numbingly repetitive inner monologue and adding the crucial perspective of the camera the filmmakers have also made Ana a somewhat tougher more skeptical heroine played by Johnson with a very appealing combo of little-girl-lost naivete and gradually deepening assertiveness. One of the movies more amusingly tongue-in-cheek moments finds the two leads seated at opposite ends of a conference table enacting perhaps the most eccentric contract negotiation scene since ""A Night at the Opera."" Naturally Anas agonizing deferral of her decision -- whether or not to become Mr. Greys personal sex slave -- doesnt keep them from sampling each others wares in the meantime starting with a scene at roughly the 40-minute mark in which Christian divests her of that pesky virginity in a safe handcuff-free environment before slowly introducing her to the exquisite pleasures of pain. By the generally prudish standards of the mainstream the bedroom action on display manages to be appreciably more explicit than the studio norm while steering clear of anything particularly objectionable. Breasts and buttocks are lavished with matter-of-fact attention in d.p. Seamus McGarveys precisely framed widescreen compositions while a trio of editors -- including Oscar-winning veteran Anne V. Coates whose many salient credits include ""Unfaithful"" ""Out of Sight"" and ""Striptease"" -- navigate smoothly between closeups and full-body shots their every cut maintaining a careful visual partition around the actors modesty. (Unsurprisingly for a movie with this particular control/submit dynamic the usual gender-based double standard prevails plenty of Johnson but only a fleeting glimpse of johnson.) See MoreFifty Shades to Play on 75 Imax Screens Before her 2009 feature debut with ""Nowhere Boy"" Taylor-Johnson made an earlier foray into onscreen sexuality with the short film ""Death Valley"" (included in the little-seen 2006 art-porn omnibus ""Destricted"") which consisted of a young man pleasuring himself in the desert for eight grindingly tedious minutes. ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" offers her a much livelier and vastly more commercial feature-length canvas to work on though it also forces her to elide the more intimate particulars of Christian and Anas relationship hemmed in by an R rating that in a less craven world should rightly have been an NC-17. Obviously there are scenes from the book that were never going to pass muster here most notoriously a sex act involving a feminine hygiene product that would have been right at home in Nagisa Oshimas 1976 arthouse scandal ""In the Realm of the Senses""; certainly theres nothing here to compare with the much more grim and unyielding portrait of female self-debasement in Lars von Triers recent ""Nymphomaniac."" But to be fair theres also nothing here that could possibly rival a culture where hardcore bondage is just one more ho-hum niche in the great big pornucopia of the Internet -- a culture that among many consequences has banished provocative sexually mature cinema to the theatrical fringe. In that respect theres something at once underwhelming and almost heartening about the sleek professional softcore spectacle of ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" which substitutes a genteel visual shorthand for James hot-and-heavy descriptions duly cushioned by the rhythmic thrusts and heaves of Danny Elfmans score. (The soundtrack selections including tracks by Ellie Goulding Sia and Beyonce establish an initially lovey-dovey mood that turns vaguely sinister as things progress.) The film is arguably much more graphically indulgent as a piece of real-estate porn given the seductive grandeur of production designer David Wascos immaculate sets shot against the wintry cityscape of Vancouver (ably standing in for the Pacific Northwest locations). And in a picture where clothing might well have been beside the point Mark Bridges costumes offer precise delineations of character from Christians custom-fit suits and gray neckties (not just a namesake wardrobe choice but a handy prop) to Anas increasingly relaxed and stylish dresses. James novels were pilloried in some quarters for glorifying abusive relationships and hailed in others for subverting bondage and role play with a striking vision of female empowerment. Whatever ones interpretation the story they tell is meant to be one of redemption in which Ana proves herself to be the true dominant by luring the abused damaged Christian out of his playroom and into the world of functional human relationships -- one represented here by his adoptive mother (Marcia Gay Harden) and Anas sweet but distracted mother (Jennifer Ehle) and spirited best friend (Eloise Mumford) all glimmering beacons of sanity and emotional stability. Unfortunately its a drama that can scarcely sustain one movie let alone three and as our heroine becomes ever more aware of just how dark Christians dark side is ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" starts to lose its sense of humor and elicit the wrong kind of giggles -- climaxing with a hilariously overblown Samp;M montage laden with so many slow-motion dissolves as to suggest that Ana wasnt the only one wearing a blindfold during the assembly. The final half-hour or so is punishing in more than just a literal sense bringing us to a less-than-scintillating cliffhanger in the now de rigueur manner of book-based fan-driven franchise fare. Dornan a charismatic presence largely nails (among other things) the combination of intense formality and playful lewdness that defines Christian Grey but he proves rather less skilled at illuminating the complex inner life of a sexual deviant. ""I exercise control in all things"" he notes early on -- spoken like a man who doesnt realize hes still got two sequels to go.

Are we all just broken? They did a great job capturing so many different emotions. Kelly Sutherland Reply Kelly marie says March 5 2015 at 140 pm I only read half of the first book but I have watched the movie twice already and I love it. Its a romantic.....kinky......love story and I cant wait to see the next film an I hope its the same actors as they played there parts brilliantly..... Reply John Shea says March 3 2015 at 214 am A sexual deviant? Deviant from what? Reply Tessa Winters says February 19 2015 at 729 am Loved this review. Not a fan of the movie. The writing was so poor and the sex scenes just made me uncomfortable because I didnt see the chemistry between Ana and Christian. I think Dakota Johnson did a good job though. At least as well as she could with such a bad movie Reply Jan says February 16 2015 at 939 pm Great review..with one exception. It is clear in the book FSOG that Christian DOES NOT stalk and groom young women for his prediliction. He finds women who are open to BDSM who are experienced who know what theyre getting into. Sometimes ""Mrs. Robinson"" helps him. He makes this clear to Ana. She is the only inexperienced woman he has sought....hes attracted to her and hopes that he can turn into his submissive because thats the only way he knows.....at this point. The point of the first book is....will Ana submit. Reply Kellie says February 16 2015 at 958 am Is this a joke review? a C+ Cinescore? Yes my girlfriends and I went but we laughed our way through this film-and the theater was laughing. Loudly. This may not have meant to be a comedy but people left feeling they took serious material and turned it into a farce. A terrible adaptation. Reply jamesblames says February 14 2015 at 744 am every year we get reviewers fawning praise over absolute rubbish......this is another example.....if you find merit in this crap then you dont have taste. Reply ItsMe says February 13 2015 at 531 pm So does Variety get paid to write such a positive review. This one seems to go out of its way to find the positives. Most other reviews have placed the movie as being somewhere between terrible and mediocre. This is by far the most positive review that I have read and its so far removed from the others it really makes me wonder why its that way. Reply timgray2013 says February 13 2015 at 613 pm Youre kidding right? Havent you ever liked a film that none of your friends liked or vice-versa? Tastes vary. Its as simple as that. Reply Tazuki Kurata says February 12 2015 at 904 am I respect you opinions on this review Justin Chang. Dont pay attention to the craps other people say. Because of your review Ill go Fifty Shades of Grey as soon as it releases in my country. Reply MissFaulkner says February 11 2015 at 1056 pm Comparing it to Charlotte Bronte makes it sound like youve never read anything by Charlotte Bronte before. Jane Eyre would never have put up with this shit. Christian Grey on the other hand is eerily similar to Arthur Huntingdon from the Tenant of Wildfell Hall by Anne Bronte. The only difference is that Annes main character Helen fights back and wins. ) Reply BoDo says February 11 2015 at 846 am After the movie ended I was completely stunned as in my jaw dropped. The reason- I liked this movie more than I thought I would a great deal more. I really thought I would dislike it and find so many faults much like the book. If youre a fan of the Fifty Shades of Grey book you will eat up this movie and love it hungry for more. If you havent read Fifty Shades of Grey you will enjoy the movie for what it is and will be anxious to see Fifty Shades Darker the sequel which was announced as moving forward. Fifty Shades of Grey was very entertaining with many moments of humor and a romance that should appeal to both men and women. Its a perfect date movie including one for Valentines Day. Those who are looking for more spice in their movies Fifty Shades of Grey is the movie to see. The love scenes are well choreographed and sexy. When the time comes for the BDSM scenes they are extremely well done and very erotic. Reply lulu says February 11 2015 at 816 am I cant stop laughing at this review. This guy actually wanted a porno film lol. Quite frankly Im glad the sex is toned down. If I want to see a porn Ill put one on. The reviewer writes as if they made Ana into this strong figure for the film and this is exactly how she is in the book. In the beginning of book two she really sets Christian straight after seeing what hes capable of. Ana becomes a strong-willed woman in FSOG. Heck in the third book shes telling Christian what to do to her lol. Clearly all you perverts wanted some kind of porn movie which FSOG isnt about. Its about this man who goes thru such tragedy in his life which leads him not to be close to anyone. He keeps his distance until he meets Ana who is the only person who can get close to him. This is a guy who was basically raped (even though he didnt see it that way) and abused as a child so much he never sought love. He cant even stand to be touched thats why the bonding of hands is so important. Its so no one can touch him and not for sexual gratification. The ignorance of this review is disgraceful. Stop treating this film like its a porno where you fast forward passed the story just to get to the sex. Reply liza9113 says February 16 2015 at 1217 pm You deserve an award. I couldnt have said better myself. Reply vp19 says February 11 2015 at 950 am Yes nothing says ""romance"" like BDSM especially when a ""hunky"" man is involved. Im sure millions of shopgirls and receptionists will go wild over this silliness while munching on their bon-bons. Reply Jude says February 11 2015 at 1150 am So is it ok for poor old Christian who had a terrible abusive childhood to rape Ana then which he does near the beginning of FSOG? Im not a pervert and I dont want a porno film just dont want to see a film about a highly abusive man manipulate a young inexperienced girl. Some romance Jess says February 11 2015 at 921 am Slow clap for you I couldnt have said it any better. God. you will love the film. If you havent watched it yet. (Im lucky bc it was released in my country the same day its released in Berlin.) Its sad but only a few people will understand this story no matter how hard we try to do so. And I am seriously glad that Im not the only one who thinks this. Reply Jude says February 11 2015 at 1120 pm He didnt nearly rape her he did. This is what happened......Christian turns up uninvited. He proceeds to try to seduce Ana. Ana tells him that she doesnt want sex and would rather talk. ""No I protest kicking him off."" Hearing the woman he claims to care for saying a very definite ""no"" to sex he replies with these words ""If you struggle Ill tie your feet too. If you make a noise Anastasia I will gag you. Keep quiet. Katherine is probably outside listening right now."" He then proceeds to have sex with her in spite of her trying to kick him away and saying ""no."" Thats not rough sex thats rape. He twitters on about her using a safe word and Id have thought no was a fairly obvious one to be starting with. Amy SP says February 11 2015 at 836 pm He didnt nearly rape her. She liked it and wanted it. Some people get hot over rough sex. Danna says February 11 2015 at 912 am Well said Reply TONY says February 11 2015 at 737 am TRASH. With bad reviews. BRILLIANT. The devils attempt failed. Reply Tazuki Kurata says February 13 2015 at 1203 am Not .... excellent reviews. And the movie will make a lot of cash. Accept it. LOL Reply stefaroohS says February 11 2015 at 103 am For a book with supposedly so much graphic sex I am surprised to see the film turn out so demure and dimple on the sex front. Another Hollywood hype that fails to live up to the material (even if that material is complete trite). They should have gotten a European director and studio on board here. Reply Will C says February 12 2015 at 252 am Im sure Lars von Trier would have been game to do ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" if he hadnt already done the material infinitely better in the ""Eastern and Western Church"" chapter of ""Nymph()maniac"". ;-) Reply guylodge says February 11 2015 at 514 am Well they did get a European director. Reply nircea says February 11 2015 at 1232 am Tooo mach sex for me Reply geekgirlglory says February 10 2015 at 1113 pm seriously did you even really read the book. the book isnt about the sex...it is about self hate and learning to move past child abuse and sexual abuse in a mans world. she wasnt ""writing the article"" when they met she just did the interview because her room mate couldnt go. the room mate wrote the article. the sex is just a small portion of this story. seriously this review is laughable at best from someone who seriously was looking at just the sex part and not the story as a whole. i did find the british lingo a bit off putting but it is just words in british form. Deal and move on. the books are wonderful and e.l. james did a good job with telling the story. so it was a first writing attempt but she made more money off it then you will in a lifetime. id say pretty successful. people need to pull their heads out of the sand. Reply liza9113 says February 16 2015 at 1216 pm Couldnt agree more Reply Naseem Randhawa says February 10 2015 at 724 pm I found myself laughing more than once reading this review. Insightful witty and appropriately justified review of the movie. Reply Aaron Steckman says February 10 2015 at 452 pm Why is this fantasy romance not just a lifetime movie? I guess it could be well filmed but who cares? Its about nothing. Young innocent girl meets rich adventurous in bed man....and???? Really the only fantasy part is the money which makes the whole movie pretty weak in my opinion. But thats why its called an opinion I suppose. Btw this review doesnt exactly strike me as fresh. Most reviews seem to be saying ""its not as bad as we thought"". Wow Sounds like a magical evening out. Heres my twenty bucks. Reply Julienne says February 10 2015 at 431 pm Who cares if its not great acting...its a porno Reply Alex says February 10 2015 at 249 pm This flick is going to get so-so or awful reviews...and will still be a big money maker. Critics are going to be pissed. Reply Julienne says February 10 2015 at 431 pm The critics are wrong more often than not. MOST critics are failed film makers Reply okay says February 10 2015 at 941 pm Just because it makes money doesnt mean the critics are wrong. People cant look away from a train wreck and its pretty well established that many people are going to be hate-watching. The critics are right; the movie is crap. That doesnt mean it wont make money... realestatemagnet says February 10 2015 at 218 pm I havent seen the movie yet but I did run out to Target the other day for a new set of anal beads and they just didnt seem to be as good as the anal beads in the book... Im sure you guys know what I mean. After that experience Im hesitant to try either the vibrating butt plugs or nipple clamps from the 50 Shades line. I am curious to know what other peoples experience has been? Reply vp19 says February 10 2015 at 121 pm Has hugely popular (but aesthetically terrible) 1920s author Elinor Glyn (""Three Weeks"") been reincarnated as E.L. James? This sounds like a Clara Bow cinematic vehicle for 21st-century shopgirls only with the addition of BDSM. Reply Gilda says February 10 2015 at 1249 pm You couldnt pay me to watch this movie. EL James is an awful writer truly shockingly bad who just happened to write about something that appealed to sex starved women and gullible young teens. She basically stole Stephenie Meyers characters of Edward and Bella and write her fantasy then changed the names later. She is no different from thousands of other amateur writers except she had the luck to have the Twilight fandom to take advantage of. Most of them hate her now. Reply liza9113 says February 16 2015 at 1225 pm In a way its also about the maturity level. Im sorry but I bet you couldnt even write a successful book. Even more successful than the ridiculous vampire series. Reply CS says February 10 2015 at 441 pm Its giving the source material more dignity than it deserves to refer to the author Erika Mitchell by the pen name E L James; its just as appropriate to refer to her by her original pen name of Snowqueens Icedragon. Reply Dunstan says February 10 2015 at 1142 am Justin Chang has outdone himself with this hilarious review. Reply Lisa says February 10 2015 at 1135 am Why? Just Why? Ugh. Reply Jim says February 10 2015 at 1050 am Good review. Reply tammyinlalaland (tammyinlalaland) says February 10 2015 at 1038 am (Unsurprisingly for a movie with this particular control/submit dynamic the usual gender-based double standard prevails plenty of Johnson but only a fleeting glimpse of johnson.) After all the literary bashing you have this in your review? Opps... Reply ravengirl57 says February 10 2015 at 237 pm Oh come on that was clever. Reply MOVIELAND REVIEW says February 10 2015 at 1025 am This british book is so unknown within THE REAL AMERICA yet the brits were stupid enough to set this faux adult fiction junkbook within America. That was one of the first bad moves by this alien imported british nonmovie nonevent. Another is inflating its sales figures by 10000 percent especially within the real America where it is unknown and unheard of. America obviously hasnt been paying attention to it and America obviously isnt about to start. Reply liza9113 says February 16 2015 at 1231 pm Oh cmon. AMERICA? Please Your beautiful and perfect America is one infected place. Were the number one place in the world with the highest STD ratings that has nothing to do with book. I loved the books. Praise for E.L James. Reply Mallory K says February 11 2015 at 224 am I wasnt aware that the entire population of Britain wrote Fifty Shades of Grey. Reply Well then says February 10 2015 at 149 pm America this America that; I think the entire thing wrong with this book is that its awfully written and yet had the luck to appeal to a lot of bored individuals who will literally consume anything if its got some kinky sex content. Might I remind you this IS essentially a fanfiction of Stephanie Meyers book - isnt she American? Reply ted says February 10 2015 at 1039 am Everything about it is pretty hokey Reply Hpz says February 10 2015 at 1012 am That first sentence is just priceless. Best. Reviewer. Ever. So funny ) Reply TV Watcher says February 10 2015 at 1242 pm I agree. The first sentence is one of the best ones Ive ever read in a film review just outstanding. This really can stand as the Rotten Tomatoes summary as it tells me all I need to know. Reply Glenn C. says February 10 2015 at 1008 am Oh so many sex deprived married women will adore this Their fantasies come true on a screen But then they return to the reality of their own bedroom Thus wishing to be back in the theatre Reply Joyce Tyler says February 10 2015 at 959 am Love this review Justin Chang.

James books that inspired it. And yet thats exactly why it works. Fifty Shades begins with Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson nuanced) a demure college senior arriving for an interview in the office of Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan stiff) Seattles most eligible billionaire. It isnt long before the two are bound together like a harlequin romance novel. The virginal Anastasia however is in for a surprise Christian is as kinky as he is rich. Inevitably this telling of the tale has been neutered to the brink of recognition. Christian is an Samp;M fetishist and when Anastasia is invited into her new partners ""Red Room of Pain"" shes confronted by a wonderland of leather rope and repurposed circus equipment. And yet by the time the movie ends just a few mild spankings later Fifty Shades feels like going on a trip to Disney World and only riding the monorail. But Sam Taylor-Johnsons film becomes fascinating for the finesse with which she navigates the prudishness forced upon it. The director is capable of pivoting from romantic comedy to erotic drama at the whack of a flogger her dexterity allowing the tepid sex scenes to be framed by a surprisingly sensitive story of self-discovery. Substituting heartache for handcuffs Fifty Shades is the rare studio romance in which the characters actually try to understand one another. As this is the first installment of an epic trilogy how much there is beneath the surface remains to be seen but Taylor-Johnson seems genuinely interested in finding out. Fifty Shades may not make you come but youll still be glad you went.

Daily Edition Login to download Fifty Shades of Grey Film Review 600 AM PST 2/11/2015 by Sheri Linden FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS A well-cast conversation starter by turns provocative and romance-novel gooey TWITTER Bondage stakes its claim on the multiplex as Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele transition steamily from best-seller to the big screen. As the tens of millions of readers of Fifty Shades of Grey know Christian Grey doesnt do hearts and flowers. The long-fingered antihero of E L James 2011 novel is a sexual dominant practiced and resolute determined to make Anastasia Steele his submissive without giving her the dreaded ""more"" -- i.e. the dinner-date trappings of conventional romance. Both on the page and in the glossy compellingly acted screen adaptation one of the more perverse aspects of their zeitgeist-harnessing story is the breathless way it melds the erotic kink known as BDSM with female wish-fulfillment fantasy of a decidedly retro slant. Hearts and flowers are barely concealed beneath the pornographic surface and as with most mainstream love stories an infatuated but commitment-averse male is in need of rehabilitation. Arriving on Valentines weekend with record-setting ticket presales the first in a planned trilogy of movies will stoke the ardor of James fans entice curious newbies and in every way live up to the ""phenomenon"" hype. Although the books soft-X explicitness has been toned down to a hard R this is the first studio film in many years to gaze directly at the Medusa of sex -- and unlike such male-leer predecessors as 91/2 Weeks it does so from a womans perspective. Aiming to please the filmmakers submit without hesitation to the bold yet hokey source material with leads Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson breathing a crucial third dimension into cutout characters. See more Fifty Shades of Greys Jamie Dornan and 18 More Male Models Turned Actors Director Sam Taylor-Johnson who depicted the psychosexual domestic drama of John Lennons adolescence in Nowhere Boy has a feel for the dark corners of relationships. Telling the story of a virginal young woman in thrall to a man with ""singular"" needs -- the book began as Twilight fan fiction -- she depicts fringe pursuits within a familiar reassuring romance-novel dynamic. And she makes brisk cinema of the opening sequence placing English-lit major Anastasia in the gleaming high-rise Seattle office of supercapitalist Grey and setting up the contrast between her fumbling innocence and his affected formality. Shes a last-minute substitute for her roommate Kate (Eloise Mumford) whos home nursing a cold while Anastasia interviews the young entrepreneur for their school paper. In that glass box Dornan seems lacking as the stormy-eyed Grey displaying little of the animal magnetism of the serial killer he plays on BBC series The Fall (indirectly referenced in an exchange of in-joke dialogue). But his performance quickly grows fascinating in its containment revealing a disturbingly more animated side of Grey when he next encounters Ana. With a suddenness that wouldnt be out of place in a horror thriller he shows up in the aisles of the hardware store where she works and leaves her deeply flustered as she helps him with a shopping list of items -- rope and cable ties among them -- whose true purpose shell soon understand. Read more Fifty Shades of Grey Ticket Sales Hot in the South But not all that soon. Its a slow build to the smutty bits and one thats disappointingly devoid of tension. Even so the movie is by definition a stronger proposition than the book because it strips away the oodles of cringe-inducing descriptions and internal monologue that tip the text heavily toward self-parody. Things grow more compelling once Grey whips out his nondisclosure agreement -- along with a nice Pouilly-Fume naturally -- and shows Ana his ""playroom"" expertly outfitted with state-of-the-art Samp;M gear. Except for his prowess at pleasuring women everything is slightly off in Grey from the not-quite-swagger of entitlement to the not-quite-revealed memories of a wounded childhood. In his first major big-screen performance Dornan creates a remarkable range within Greys tightly wound intensity. When he takes Ana up in a magnificent glider both characters let go and the two leads wordlessly evince very different forms of unhinged joy equally affecting. Read more Fifty Shades of Grey Lubricant Claimed Ineffective In Class-Action Lawsuit The screenplay by Kelly Marcel whose only previous feature credit is the utterly wholesome Saving Mr. Banks is ultra-faithful to James writing and retains some of its most risible lines. Many of these fall to Dornan who finds the icily deranged conviction in such morsels as ""Im not going to touch you until I have your written consent"" and ""Welcome to my world"" Greys pronouncement after receiving said consent and giving Ana her first spanking. As the attraction plays out Ana is both doe-eyed and skeptical challenging Grey on his philosophy as well as specific clauses of the contract that would officially make her his submissive. They negotiate that document in a nighttime ""business meeting"" with cinematographer Seamus McGarvey finding a stylized sensuality in the widescreen frame. Throughout the film his use of close-ups is fully attuned to the central performances. Read more Fifty Shades of Grey U.K. Hardware Stores Stock Up on Bondage Props Ahead of Films Release First seen looking in a mirror Anastasia is a figure defined by self-discovery. Shes embarking on postcollege life at the same time that she experiences a physical awakening that she never would have imagined. Although the characters literary leanings are as flatly drawn as Greys vague philanthropic undertakings and high-powered tech-biz talk Johnson is captivating. Her facial features recall both her parents (Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson) but shes very much her own actor. With a loose-limbed naturalness she conveys naivete intellectual curiosity and romantic yearning and shows the unassuming Anas newfound thrill at being seen however complicated the man holding her in his admiring gaze. Shes open and vulnerable but no fool. Best of all Johnson and her director embrace Anas paradox She snickers at Christians predilections but they also turn her on. The movie too wants to have it both ways Informative and nonjudgmental about bondage and discipline it distances itself from such pursuits with shard-sharp slivers of backstory indicating that Christians desires are expressions of trauma-induced pathology. Hes supremely dreamy damaged goods ripe for the saving. And so the moonlit postcoital sonatas he plays at his piano -- interludes of self-conscious melancholy that are among the most laugh-out-loud schmaltzy in the book transplanted whole to the screen. Read more Fifty Shades of Grey Religious Organization Asks Theaters to Reject ""Epitome of Elevating Abuse"" From meet-cute to deflowering to the sequel-setup ending the relationship between Ana and Christian is one of carefully navigated mutual consent. Their first use of his playroom is packaged in a montage-y way that feels nonthreatening and more than a little generic complete with intrusive pop-track accompaniment. A few dom-sub contract details and a couple of online photos notwithstanding the movie maintains an artful restraint even as it talks dirty; the sex scenes suggest more than those of the standard Hollywood drama without quite going there. The penultimate scene where Christian punishes Anastasia with a belt -- and thrills to it as Dornan communicates with exquisite subtlety -- is by far the films most extreme. Surrounding the steamy/clinical pas de deux are barely sketched types Jennifer Ehle plays Anastasias much-married mother Victor Rasuk is her smitten photographer friend and Luke Grimes is Christians demonstrative brother. Among these half-conceived characters Mumford as Anas all-American valedictorian best friend and Marcia Gay Harden as Christians adoptive mother make the sharpest impressions.

When its not insistently bland and overused Danny Elfmans score hits the right notes of heart-thumping dread/excitement accentuating Anastasias point of view. The inclusion of on-the-nose songs such as ""Beast of Burden"" is more distracting than helpful but the opening-credits use of ""I Put a Spell on You"" sets the right hot-and-bothered tone.

(Universal Pictures) Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated Tuesday February 10 2015 1002 AM Title Fifty Shades of Grey Film Info With Dakota Johnson Jamie Dornan. Sultry romance between a wide-eyed virgin and a bondage-minded billionaire. Director Sam Taylor-Johnson (205). R Explicit sex graphic nudity language. Area theaters. Opens Thursday night. If Hollywood still has doubts about whether women can dominate at the box office the steamy -- if occasionally stilted -- adaptation of E. L. James Samp;M romance novel ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" should push them aside permanently. One of the things weve learned from James (besides proper paddling protocol) is that we take the pleasure with the pain. Her erotic trilogy is such a massive global phenomenon that any movie version was bound to heat up Valentines Day. But lets be honest Her writing is almost as famous for its cringeworthy dialogue as its unflinching sex scenes. So credit goes to director Sam Taylor-Johnson and her screenwriter Kelly Marcel whove stripped the first book of its biggest flaws while still honoring its essence. And lead Dakota Johnson makes for an ideal heroine though -- as doubters feared -- her chemistry with costar Jamie Dornan doesnt always sizzle. The filmmakers show their sense of humor right up front by bringing the leads together in lighthearted meet-cute style. College senior Anastasia Steele (Johnson) is roped into interviewing billionaire businessman Christian Grey (Dornan) after her journalist roommate (Eloise Mumford) gets sick. Though shes as inexperienced as he is arrogant they connect instantly. But hes controlling and shes resistant -- especially when she finds out just what ""controlling"" means. Christian in case you havent heard likes to dominate in every aspect of his life. And -- with her full agreement -- he wants Ana to be equally submissive. Hed like to tell her what to wear who to see how to eat. If she resists shell be punished. Which brings us to Christians infamous Red Room of Pain a crimson dungeon generously stocked with every harness flogger and shackle an R-rated movie can handle. Director Sam Taylor-Johnson does well in balancing atmosphere with action. (Universal Pictures) FIFTY SHADES OF MAKEUP CHECK OUT HOW YOU CAN GET ANAS LOOK Both actors do strip down and the books centerpiece scenes are faithfully recreated. But anyone hoping the movie would really push the Samp;M envelope may find Christians tastefully shot toy room a little... vanilla. We see a whip here a handcuff there but nothing that would shock even newcomers to the series. What Taylor-Johnson does best is balance atmosphere with action Desks benches bathtubs and red leather beds are all creatively employed as is camerawork designed to show us plenty of skin with just a few full-frontal revelations. Dornan unfortunately never evolves into anything more than a pretty face. But Johnson is a true find Shes so committed she makes Anas every discovery -- in or out of the bedroom -- convincing. Christians infamous Red Room of Pain is stocked with Samp;M toys but the film doesnt quite push the envelope. (Fifty Shades of Grey) Though the books always reflected the trilogys roots as ""Twilight"" fan fiction the movie aims to give Ana in particular a story and identity of her own. Shes smarter and sassier than her literary counterpart while Christian thank goodness is less creepy-stalkerish. Aside from Dornans apparent discomfort there are other flaws fans will have to overlook. Except for Mumford the supporting cast -- including Marcia Gay Harden as Christians mom and Rita Ora as his sister -- is underused. And yes some of the more earnest moments threaten to cross the border into camp. Frankly though the filmmakers earn points just for cutting the novels many excesses.
