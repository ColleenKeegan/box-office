Lee David Zucker Comedy PG-13 1h 26m By ANDY WEBSTERAPRIL 12 2013 Continue reading the main story Share This Page Continue reading the main story Photo Lindsay Lohan in ""Scary Movie V."" Credit Quantrell D. Colbert/Weinstein Company Its not even Halloween and Dimension Films (the Weinstein Companys horror action and sophomoric-comedy arm) is releasing ""Scary Movie V"" the latest installment of the slick highly profitable parody franchise. Hollywood has certainly kept the screenwriters (the ""Scary Movie"" veterans Pat Profft and David Zucker) supplied with material the biggest targets here are the ""Paranormal Activity"" series ""Black Swan"" and ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" with nods to ""Mama"" ""The Ring"" ""Saw"" and others.The ""Scary"" movies are noted for its cameo appearances and ""V"" is no exception Molly Shannon Snoop Dogg (I thought he was Snoop Lion) Heather Locklear Usher Mike Tyson and Tyler Perry as his Madea character parade through the scattershot skits. Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan have a faintly amusing bit at the start in which theyre in bed and Mr. Sheen mocks his sexual appetites as Ms. Lohan gamely pokes fun at her arrest record.Handily inheriting the mantle of ""Scary Movie"" scream queen from Anna Faris is Ashley Tisdale a Disney-factory graduate and ""High School Musical"" comic asset whose elastic face lends itself to numerous reaction shots. (Somebody give her a sitcom or at least a better movie.) There is a plot thread -- about a couple (Ms. Tisdale and Simon Rex) who adopt children haunted by a nefarious mother-spirit -- but forget it.The pot and potty jokes are to be expected while repeated casual denigrations of the couples Hispanic housekeeper (Lidia Porto) inadvertently suggest affluent unthinking Los Angeles prejudice. Most effective are high-speed video sequences (a ""Paranormal"" staple) used for silent-movie physical comedy. And a poolside soiree of possessed hard-partying home appliances has its moments. But Marlon Wayanss satire ""A Haunted House"" got to ""Paranormal"" first and for a much smaller budget delivered bigger laughs. ""Scary Movie V"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes a vomiting vacuum cleaner monkey suit gags and Charlie Sheen. Scary Movie 5 Directors Malcolm D.

"Scary Movie 5 is the ghost of a once-good idea review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesScary Movie 5 is the ghost of a once-good idea reviewWith Scary Movie 5 youd have an easier time reading a zombies pulse than finding a single good laugh Ashley Tisdale in a scene from Scary Movie 5.  (QUANTRELL D. COLBERT / THE WEINSTEIN COMPANY/MCT)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticSat. April 13 2013Scary Movie 5Starring Ashley Tisdale Simon Rex Erica Ash and Molly Shannon. Directed by Malcolm D. Lee. At GTA theatres. 85 minutes.You want to see something really scary?If so youve come to the wrong film with Scary Movie 5 the latest ghastly emission from the horror parody franchise that refuses to die. Article Continued BelowIts not meant to terrify. Its supposed to be funny but youd have an easier time reading a zombies pulse than you would finding a single good laugh in the movie which opened without critical previews natch.When the franchise began in 2000 the Wayans Bros. Keenen Ivory Shawn and Marlon riffed off Scream The Blair Witch Project Buffy the Vampire Slayer and other fright flicks for reasons of hilarity. Subsequent instalments did the same to whatever blood-spillers were happening at the moment. But now the Wayans are long gone and so are franchise regulars Anna Faris and Regina Hall. Whats left is the ghost of a once-good idea directed by Malcolm D. Lee (The Best Man) a once-promising filmmaker who seems to have joined the ranks of the walking dead. Scary Movie 5 flatlines right out of the gate. A pre-credits parody of Paranormal Activity features Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan trying to make fun of their public images as law-breaking hellraisers and substance abusers. Whats the opposite of ""winning"" Charlie? Yes failing.From there Scary Movie sequels vet Simon Rex and newcomer Ashley Tisdale (High School Musical) log the most screen time as married couple Dan and Jody Sanders who live in a Paranormal Activity home with adopted children from a Mama nightmare. Dan works as a primate researcher for a Rise of the Planet of the Apes company while Jody tries to make it as a Black Swan ballet dancer.Star cameos by the likes of Snoop Dogg Heather Locklear Mike Tyson and Terry Crews help pad out an 85-minute running time that feels twice as long.The obnoxious overuse of Shakycam makes it hard to watch. The only thing more annoying is how lame the jokes are. Youd have thought that producer/writer David Zucker would remember how to make people laugh from his Airplane days. Youd have thought wrong.Just one thing surprises in Scary Movie 5 and thats how quickly the film manages to parody the Evil Dead remake which opened just last week. But its still not scary or funny.The Scary Movie franchise has never been quality cinema but it did have a ribald energy and the occasional good gag. Now its just a frightful waste of time.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Review Scary Movie V moves between frenzied and stoned - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Movies_nowReview Scary Movie V moves between frenzied and stonedThe eye-rolling antics abound in the latest horror-film parody where even Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan are barely believable as themselves.April 12 2013|By Amy Nicholson Ashley Tisdale stars ""Scary Movie V."" (Quantrell D. Colbert Weinstein...)Poor Charlie Sheen In the opening of ""Scary Movie V"" no sooner does he bed Lindsay Lohan a both barely convincing playing themselves a than a ghost kills him and kidnaps his three kids. (Legal troubles aside Lohan is fine.) Three months later Snoop Dogg finds the now-crabwalking moppets in a haunted cabin in Humboldt County and delivers them and their new ghost mom back to civilization.Three months is auspicious. ""Scary Movie V"" lifts its plot from Jessica Chastains surprise horror hit ""Mama"" released in January and if you think three months is an impossible amount of time to write and produce a feature film well it is. In the Oscar nominees role is former Disney star Ashley Tisdale here seen having her way with a microwave. A game comedian she earns our applause through sheer empathy.Director Malcolm D. Lees strategy is to out-stupid the competition. Roll your eyes at ""Paranormal Activity 2s"" haunted robot pool cleaner? Here the droid stirs to life to throw a raging house party snorting bleach through its nozzle and somehow playing beer pong without any hands.For the art-house crowd who may I suppose stumble drunk into the wrong theater after too much Chardonnay there are nods to ""Black Swan"" and ""127 Hours."" Kudos to comedian J.P. Manoux for his excellent impersonation of Vincent Cassel from ""Swan"" not that ""Scary Movie Vs"" target audience will notice.The pacing alternates between frantic and stoned. Within five minutes an ""Inception"" gag begets a ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" gag begets a cameo from Mike Tyson who at this point in his career appears to be a gag just by showing up. While another five minutes drags on in a montage in which Simon Rex repeatedly electrocutes himself installing security cameras the better to prevent Ghost Mom from sticking Tisdales toothbrush up the wrong end of a German shepherd.Animals have it almost as bad here as Lidio Porto cast in the thankless role of Tisdale and Rexs Mexican maid. She never gets her deserved vengeance in a film that thinks her bottom in a thong bikini is the height of hilarity but at least a chimpanzee gets the films fitting last line ""Apes need to take over this planet.""calendarlatimes.com-----------------Scary Movie VMPAA ratingA PG-13 for crude and sexual content throughout language some drug material partial nudity comic violence and goreRunning timeA 1 hour 25 minutesPlayingA In general release PHOTOS AND MORE Roger Ebert Career in pictures ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz PHOTOS Greatest box office flops MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESVideo Music Awards provide sideshowsSeptember 13 2010The Mirror Has 36 FacesJanuary 5 1997MORE STORIES ABOUTMovies_nowLindsay LohanNot_live_webEntertainmentCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-scary-movie-five-review-20130413,0,5378236.story",200,scarymovie52,scarymovie5,latimes

Colbert) D Scary Movie V Genre Comedy; Starring Regina Hall Lindsay Lohan Charlie Sheen; Release Date Wide 04/12/2013; Runtime (in minutes) 85; Distributor The Weinstein Company Posted April 29 2013 -- 1200 AM EDT The latest and worst entry in the Scary Movie franchise begins with Lindsay Lohan and Charlie Sheen in bed together. Theres a joke about Lohans driving ability. Theres a joke about how much Sheen parties. Wait youve heard those jokes before? Well what if I told you that the whole thing is also a parody of Paranormal Activity? Oh youve heard that joke before? Then you should probably steer clear of Scary Movie V a film composed almost entirely of jokes that were much funnier when you read them on Twitter years ago. Hitting theaters seven years after the last Scary Movie the new film doesnt even feature the ameliorating presence of Anna Faris who gave the earlier films a certain spoofy grace. In her place is High School Musical refugee Ashley Tisdale her face frozen in an eyeroll of mild irritation. Who can blame her? The film hopscotches between too-late riffs on Rise of the Planet of the Apes Inception Insidious and Black Swan. At a running time of 86 minutes its about as long as an episode of Saturday Night Live except with less laughs and worse storytelling. In a film this bad you look for bright spots. Molly Shannon Heather Locklear Usher and Darrell Hammond all stop by for parts that last about one minute onscreen and probably took less time to shoot. Franchise mainstay Simon Rex is much funnier than anyone with the resume ""Adult film actor-turned-VJ-turned-rapper"" has any right to be. The ape costume is pretty decent. Back in 2002 director Malcolm D. Lee made the Blaxploitation spoof Undercover Brother. It wasnt a great movie but at least the comedy had a certain specificity knowingly riffing on the tropes of its genre. Here Lees spoofing barely even scratches the surface. Weirdly the central plotline of the film is taken wholesale from Mama -- a movie that hit theaters just three months ago. Points for topicality but that only increases the sense that were watching a rush job. Reportedly Scary Movie V cost 20 million to make -- roughly 20 million more than the entire budget of the first Paranormal Activity. Somehow it actually looks cheaper than Paranormal Activity. Its less funny too. D Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

Colbert/Quantrell D.Colbert) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated Friday April 12 2013 442 PM Title Scary Movie V Film Info A couple adopts two evil children in a satire of horror films. Director; Malcolm D. Lee (125) PG-13 Comedic drug use sexuality violence. Area theaters. The best comes first in ""Scary Movie V"" the fifth mockery of chillers in this 13-year-old satirical series. Thats when Lindsay Lohan and Charlie Sheen in a match made in troubled-star heaven appear as themselves in a nod to the ""Paranormal Activity"" films. Their bedroom romp is interrupted as they each have to remove their numerous electronic monitoring devices; drugs jail traffic and courtroom violations and fame itself have taken their toll. Once they get down to (comically acrobatic stunt-double-filled) business they realize a supernatural entity is in the room. Lindsay screams though its at a TV headline she spots across the room; ""Lindsay Lohan parole denied."" Then the weathered-looking but buxom reformed starlet and constant miscreant is possessed by evil and throws Sheen into a wall. ""Charlies body was discovered on May 17"" says an onscreen ""Paranormal""-esque subtitle. ""His corpse didnt stop partying until May 23."" From there things go downhill though Snoop Dogg livens things up as a stoner who sets in action the spoof of this springs hit horror film ""Mama."" Charlies ""kids"" are missing and Snoop and a pal find two feral girls and a baby in a cabin in the woods. They give them to Charlies ""brother"" and sister-in law Dan and Jody (Simon Rex and Ashkey Tisdale). Which then kick-starts more ""Paranormal Activity"" larks into gear though none are ever really funny. Theres also an extended joke on ""Black Swan"" (not quite the same audience but it gives Molly Shannon a few good moments) a psychic-exorcist character ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" (which at least brings along a guy in an ape suit) and the just-released ""Evil Dead"" (you cant say these movies arent current). Seen for quick wocca-wocca bits are a man as a black woman that looks like Tyler Perry-as-Madea an ""Inception"" echo that allows a damn good Leo Dicaprio imitation and a missed-opportunity ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" riff with Jerry OConnell sleazing it up. Like so much of this whole series - hatched in 2000 by the Wayans brothers and intermittently directed by ""Airplane"" veteran David Zucker though newcomer Malcolm D. Lee takes over here - the mere mention of a familiar pop culture figure or title is supposed to be hilarious. It often isnt and in fact the constant name-dropping and gross-out humor gets tiresome (in a movie thats at least 10 minutes too long). Luckily folks like Snoop and good sports like Sheen and yes Lohan break up the monotony. Until like an undead beastie the boredom and dumb jokes come roaring back.

(Photo by Quantrell D.Colbert) By Stephanie Merry April 12 2013 Follow stephmerry ""Scary Movie 5"" must be some kind of psychological experiment. Perhaps the filmmakers sat in a lab rubbing their temples while wondering aloud how awful they could make a movie and still score at the box office. Its the only reasonable explanation for this lazy boring vile and tragically unfunny attempt at a horror-film spoof that is sure to kill brain cells and may signal the impending apocalypse. Its the kind of movie that leaves audience members partially lobotomized exiting the theater and muttering absently to themselves ""How on earth did this movie get made?"" The answer cheaply. Each of the increasingly terrible ""Scary Movie"" installments has enjoyed an impressive return on investment so its only logical that producers want to keep making them quite literally ad nauseam. The cost-cutting is evident between the not-so-special effects and the amateur editing errors including a casual relationship between dialogue and moving mouths. Thirteen years after the first ""Scary Movie"" this new chapter follows the same general template with one exception This incarnation kicks off with Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan playing themselves preparing to make a sex tape. From there the story skips to couple Dan (Simon Rex) and Jody (Ashley Tisdale) who inherit a trio of youngsters after the demise of the kids dad (Sheen). What follows shouldnt be confused with a plot; its more a series of snippets in which the characters borrow familiar story lines from other movies including ""Mama"" ""Inception"" ""Black Swan"" and ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes."" But ""Scary Movie"" doesnt really put any kind of twist on these familiar plots so much as present them in some brainless context. But stupid doesnt necessarily equate to funny and that goes for Heather Locklear dressed as a pregnant ballerina whose water breaks all over a male dancers face as he lifts her above his head. The movie is so appalling that even a film fan who guffawed her way through ""The Aristocrats"" would feel nothing but a deep emptiness as the end credits begin to roll wondering if one solid joke was too much to ask from a movie that bills itself as comedy. But no theres nothing worthy of even a small smirk. Instead the movie serves up violence against man woman child doll and ape not to mention sexual situations involving a German shepherd a hairy overweight nanny Santa Claus an automatic swimming pool cleaner a pony and a microwave. A knock-knock joke told by a 6-year-old would be funnier than this endless stream of flatulence jokes feces-infused food items and gratuitous vomiting. For some reason watching this movie kept conjuring up the voice of Smokey Bear intoning ""Only YOU can prevent forest fires."" It must be a sign from beyond that we -- the film-going public -- have the power to end this. As long as people keep watching these inept films the ""Scary Movie"" franchise will thrive and reproduce. And that is a truly terrifying prospect. No stars PG-13. At area theaters. Contains crude language brief nudity sexual situations allusions to drug use and gory if obviously fake violence. 85 minutes. goingoutguide true Please provide a valid email address.

All of these factors must be broached in order to fully explain why ""Scary Movie 5"" is so massively un-enjoyable a hate crime against cinema a ringing indictment of the depths commercialism will go to in search of the lowest common denominator. Quick now we havent a moment to lose Jokes comedy punchlines and the like are constructed on the element of surprise. You are given one tone one direction and then the rug is pulled out from under you the curtain drawn back and an involuntary laughter rises from that momentary mental hiccup where your brain has been thrown in the other direction. Jokes by their very nature are meant to confound your expectations and great jokes confound them in new and interesting ways. Secondary punchlines callbacks improv agreement - all of these comedic elements create a foundation in which youre lured into one reality and then jolted comedically awake. This is not at all what ""Scary Movie 5"" does or even attempts because writing halfway decent jokes can be a difficult endeavor whereas ""Scary Movie 5"" is the sort of film you and I could come up with after not sleeping for three days and then drinking four bottles of wine between ourselves. Yes the ""joke"" behind ""Scary Movie 5"" if there is one (theres not) is built upon a very simple yet idiotic premise. The basic construct is 1) These are things that happen in actual scary movies and then 2) Look at them thats them the things that happen in those other movies Its almost as if youd rounded up a bunch of three-year-olds at a koi pond gave them some fish food watched them feed the fish only to have them point out the fish to you. ""Look mommy"" theyd say ""Fish"" Well yes sure darling fish. But the ability to notice something isnt the same thing as inspiring laughter because everyone notices things all the time all around us merely as a function of existing. Observing something that happens is quite different from observational humor of course because the latter makes a remark upon the knowledge whereas again simply seeing something is about the easiest thing we do all the time our frontal lobe constantly lending a helpful hand. To wit here are a few of the methods in which ""Scary Movie 5"" seeks laughs the depraved observations of a flattened intellect 1) Ashley Tisdale (as Jody) plays a guitar on her kitchen counter when the lights suddenly start flickering. This naturally worries her and she looks around for the root cause of this electrical non-conformity. She then notices the headstock of her guitar has been turning the lights on and off. Issue solved Then the lights flicker again only this time it is because of a ghost. This interaction could be described as a coincidence or a clumsy self-unaware guitarist followed up by a plot point. There isnt a joke here. There isnt an anything here. It merely is. 2) A fart propels someone across the room. There isnt a joke here. There isnt an anything here. 3) A dog has a toothbrush placed in his rectum. There isnt a joke here. There isnt an anything here. 4) A man stands under a pan and the pan falls on his head conforming exactly to our expectations of what would happen. There isnt a joke here. There isnt an anything here. 5) A banana is made of feces. There isnt a joke here. There isnt an anything here. 6) Apes throw feces. There isnt a ... well you know (see thats a little joke). This could go on for another hundred examples but its probably academic at this point as its entirely clear that no one involved with ""Scary Movie 5"" had even a passing understanding as to how comedy works. Many movies much better movies are aped and mimicked all in an effort to point out that other movies have existed just like this one and these movies include ""Inception"" ""Black Swan"" ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" and ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"". I share this only to assist should it ever come up in Trivial Pursuit please dont see ""Scary Movie 5"" to see how they reference said films. ""Look mommy other movies have been made that people have seen"" Yes dear now why dont you head back to your finger-paints while mommy makes herself a stiff drink. If a joke is to be found it has to be located firmly in the notion that this film could even have an audience or perhaps the idea that actors agreed to participate in the project in the first place. Now to be fair the opening scene with Lindsay Lohan and Charlie Sheen contains around four mild chuckles though these just end up spoiling you because they are the last mini-laughs youll be treated to for the next 85 minutes. In a way these jokes are cruel because they set up a world in which ""Scary Movie 5"" doesnt hate you an existence where it doesnt think youre a walking imbecile who is often distracted by shiny things. If we were in a relationship and I made you a dinner after a hard day of work and youd thrown that dinner across the living room fettucini alfredo scattered across the tile floor while shouting ""I want a divorce"" then ""Scary Movie 5"" would be a month later when I visited you at your dingy apartment by the freeway making you the exact same meal leaving it at your door complete with dead flowers and a note that said ""Burn in hell you sad pitiful shell of a woman"". Its that good of a movie its that hardcore of a success story. So it would be fair to say my experience with ""Scary Movie 5"" wasnt ideal. Before the movie started the helpful AMC commercials told us to keep our eyes out for danger and to report suspicious characters if we noticed anything amiss. But the only suspicious characters were us for watching the movie and the only danger was to our minds on the screen directly in front of us. Indeed one of the de facto views of our time is that the ""Scary Movie 5""s of the world will win and well all inhabit a world where commercialism and art can no longer co-exist closer than 1000 yards apart. The cynic would hold that the studio system who signed up for five of these will eventually strangle everything thats right and good about the movies while they trot toward the edge of a cliff all while giving us the thumbs up. I for one am willing to entertain that battle the struggle for hearts and minds if only because ""Scary Movie 5"" never bothers to engage either. Grade .5 out of 10 Laremy wrote the book on film criticism and dedicates this column to the late great Roger Ebert who fought the battle for hearts and minds as well as anyone ever has.

A moment of movie history Perhaps the greatest spoof film of all time was 1980s ""Airplane"" which mocked a trope of a previous decade (1970s disaster movies) by parodying a 23-year-old movie (1957s ""Zero Hour""). By contrast ""Scary Movie V"" goofs on ""Mama"" which was released 12 weeks ago. And the remake of ""Evil Dead""...which came out last week. Thirty-three years later were still quoting ""Airplane"" whereas almost no one is going to remember ""Scary Movie V"" after oh Monday. Given the steady decline of the sequels its easy to forget that the first ""Scary Movie"" released in 2000 was a mostly funny parody of ""Scream"" mixed in with lots of outrageous sight gags and random spoofy moments. This fifth entry however reeks of desperation with anything and everything thrown at the wall and almost none of it sticking. Its a movie where stop-motion vacuum cleaners and model train tunnels get the few big laughs there are to be had but these objects sadly take second billing to the human cast. ""Scary Movie V"" opens with Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan; in happier times these performers got laughs by earning them rather than exploiting their own personal tragedies for no comic payoff. Charlies missing children turn out to be living in a cabin in the woods as feral creatures leading to their adoption by Charlies brother Dan (Simon Rex) and his wife Jody (Ashley Tisdale) and they... Seriously do you even care? The movie exists as a framework on which to hang obvious jokes about ""Mama"" ""Evil Dead"" ""Paranormal Activity 4"" ""Black Swan"" ""The Help"" ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" ""Inception"" ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" and so on ad infinitum. Despite a screenplay credited to comedy veterans David Zucker (one of the brains behind ""Airplane"") and Pat Proft (as the saying goes head to his IMDB page but pack a lunch first) these gags generally revolve around racism (the Mexican maid swings at a pinata in her sleep) sexism size-ism and the shock of watching two inappropriate combatants (an adult and a child an adult male and an older woman etc.) get into a fistfight. Not that humor cant be found in fistfights and stereotypes but in ""Scary Movie V"" humor cant be found at all. Anywhere. The biggest laughs come from animated vacuum cleaners in a scene thats over all too quickly. This is the sort of movie where you feel bad for Sheen and Lohan because they hadnt actually hit rock bottom until they agreed to appear in it. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The horror spoof series returns this time tackling ""Mama"" ""Black Swan"" and others. BOTTOM LINE You know that friend of yours the one who cant tell even the simplest joke? Watching him struggle for 85 minutes would still be funnier than this movie. CAST Ashley Tisdale Simon Rex Lindsay Lohan DIRECTOR 125 Lindsay Lohans cameo is surely the biggest selling point of ""Scary Movie 5"" so lets get it out of the way first just as the movie does. Its exactly what youd expect Lohan is about to make a sex tape with Charlie Sheen but first they have to remove their court- ordered tracking devices. Then come the jokes about her driving his partying and their shared familiarity with the Los Angeles legal system. This five-minute skit might have been funny if the material werent so obvious (and if the situation didnt seem so plausible). The ""Scary Movie"" franchise has never offered the most incisive satire -- remember the ""wazzup"" routine from the 2000 original? -- but this fifth installment is so feeble so grindingly uninspired that it may set a comedy record 85 minutes without a single laugh. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Credit goes to a number of people. Ashley Tisdale a Disney Channel alum replaces four-film veteran Anna Faris but doesnt show a glimmer of comic timing; ditto for her co-star Simon Rex. Together they drag themselves through spoofs of ""Mama"" ""Black Swan"" and when the ideas really dry up ""Inception"" and ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes."" The slapdash direction from Malcolm D. Lee (a cousin of Spike) turns the sight gags into a confusing jumble of slaps and punches though the writers (including David Zucker of ""Airplane"") dont exactly come up with the sharpest ideas. Remember that mysterious pool-cleaning machine from ""Paranormal Activity 2""? Here it invites all the other machines over for a party. Even the talented people -- comedian Katt Williams as a fake psychic high-energy actor Jerry OConnell in a send-up of the ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" books -- get chewed up and spit out by this relentless antilaugh machine. ""Scary Movie 5"" doesnt even have the imagination for a worthwhile gross-out joke. When the best you can offer is a poopy toothbrush its time to pack it in.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The Scary Movie franchise like the Seltzer-Friedberg empire of garbage it spawned traffics in timeliness. But in this ADD-addled Internet age its impossible for a studio comedy even one as hastily and shoddily assembled as Scary Movie 5 to be truly timely. The Charlie Sheen/Lindsay Lohan joint cameo that made headlines a while back cant help but look like rehashed tabloid junk mere months later. And those Here Comes Honey Boo Boo and Big Ang jokes that already seem dated now will likely seem incomprehensible to audiences decades on. Willed into existence by the sinister intertwined forces of commerce and cynicism Scary Movie 5 casts Ashley Tisdale and Simon Rex as a couple who inherit a trio of spooky children from Rexs brother played by Charlie Sheen who is opportunistically cast as himself not as the fictional character he played in Scary Movies 3 and 4. (Though in those films Rex played his brother; Rex also plays a different character in Scary Movie 5 than in 3 and 4--but not himself because cmon thatd be confusing) Scary Movie 5 has so little commitment to continuity from sequel to sequel and scene to scene that it borders on avant-garde. The filmmakers have to include wall-to-wall narration from a Morgan Freeman sound-alike just to make the film even vaguely resemble a coherent narrative with a beginning middle and end rather than 85 or so minutes of random nonsense from filmmakers so clearly dispirited by their mercenary assignment that they seem to be running out the clock from the very first frame. Scary Movie 5 aspires to timeliness but its comic sensibility is so groaningly retro that the film features a series of tributes to The Benny Hill Show and its signature ditty ""Yakety Sax."" Thanks to grizzled old hacks David Zucker and Pat Proft (whose days in the comedy trenches date back to his work on The Star Wars Holiday Special) the films fundamental comic spirit is baggy-pants vaudevillian. Co-screenwriters Zucker and Proft recycle the same pratfalls and genial silliness they perfected with Police Squad and Naked Gun but those limp gags have been so ubiquitous over the years that Scary Movie 5 cant help but feel like a Xerox of earlier triumphs reproduced so often that its smudgy to the point of incomprehensibility. For Zucker this is pure hackwork limply and dispassionately executed but since the pathetic right-wing Michael Moore parody An American Carol ensued the last time Zucker was engaged with his subject material perhaps his apathy isnt altogether unwelcome.

One scene inspired by ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" features a roomful of chimps hurling their feces at the wall providing a perhaps unintended metaphor for the writing process behind this unwelcome resurrection. Still insofar as past installments have proved frighteningly lucrative (more than 800 million worldwide) there may yet be some commercial life in this pop-culture barf bag. A recent wave of horror hits - including but not limited to the ""Paranormal Activity"" franchise ""Sinister"" and ""Here Comes Honey Boo Boo"" - is the slender justification offered up for the existence of this sequel scripted by David Zucker (who helmed the previous two ""Scary"" movies) and Pat Proft. But the gleefully parodic Zucker sensibility that long ago produced the likes of ""Airplane"" and ""The Naked Gun"" seems to be choking on fumes from the opening scene featuring Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan in a sort of self-mocking celebrity-train-wreck duet that also represents the first of many tired spoofs of ""Paranormals"" sped-up surveillance-footage gimmick. But the bulk of ""Scary Movie 5"" is devoted to an extended riff on ""Mama"" which having scared up a sizable audience since its January release may well be fresh in some viewers minds. Relevance however isnt enough to breathe comedic life into the tired proceedings as Jody (Ashley Tisdale) and Dan (Simon Rex) become adoptive parents to a trio of feral youngsters found in the wild. Soon their house is being haunted by a maternal monster with a J-horror-style sewer-rat coiffure all of it captured on videocameras helpfully set up in every room. Theres something admittedly shrewd about merging elements from ""Mama"" and the ""Paranormal"" pics though the fact that these family-in-danger movies themselves tended toward the tediously repetitive ensures a similar effect in comedic terms. More random and all the more welcome for it are the many shoehorned-in references to ""Inception"" and especially ""Black Swan"" as Jodys sudden decision to revive her once-promising ballet career accompanied by much back-of-the-head wobblecam supplies the sole instance of visual wit displayed by director Malcolm D. Lee (""Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins"" ""Undercover Brother""). Audiences not inclined to laugh at the sight of a babys head catching fire are encouraged to at least chuckle at the various gags made at the expense of Jody and Dans housekeeper (a game Lidia Porto) who satisfies many of the pics comedic-target prerequisites by being plus-sized hysterically religious and Latina. Elsewhere in the cast Mike Tyson appears briefly in a scene whose purpose is so vague as to suggest a plug for ""The Hangover Part III""; Snoop Dogg briefly amuses as a stoner who stumbles upon a cabin in the woods; and Molly Shannon makes a hilariously boozy ballerina.

This is a horror movie thats really a supposed comedy; shes a supposed comedy actress whos actually scary. Its lucky that people dont often look at her face because as the worlds most haggard 26-year-old she kinda looks like someone who needs an exorcism. Lohan and Charlie Sheen who dont appear in the rest of the movie appear only in a brief opening scene as a couple about to make a sex tape while paranormal activity is occurring in the background. Fast forward through some dull sex jokes (a cat with its tail sticking up crawls under the sheets in Sheens crotch region) and ""Benny Hill Show"" theme music plays. The main story which lasts roughly an hour before the closing credits mercifully arrive A young couple (Ashley Tisdale Simon Rex) adopt his feral nieces and wind up re-enacting both ""Paranormal"" and Jessica Chastains ""Mama"" which I guess is impressive since the latter movie came out only three months ago. Not that the writers (""Naked Gun"" veterans David Zucker and Pat Proft who are out of comedy ammo) seem to have sweated the jokes. Put it this way theres a spoof of ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" in which gorillas throw their feces at the wall to see if it sticks and you cant help wondering if this is actual documentary footage of the script meetings. With its parodies of ""Black Swan"" (Heather Locklear plays a ballerina who gives birth while doing a split in the air; baby winds up in tuba) and ""Inception"" (which features a cameo by Mike Tyson that makes his appearance in ""The Hangover"" look like ""Hamlet"" by comparison) the fifth ""Scary Movie"" comes across like a series of variety-show sketches written in the elevator on the way up. Though I enjoyed the strangely whimsical scene in which while everyone in the house is asleep the pool-cleaning robots gain consciousness and invite all the machines in the neighborhood for a party. (They use their rubber hoses to snort white cleaning chemicals.) Otherwise the gags are consistent Theyre miss-or-miss. The odd obsession with ""Black Swan"" (is this a movie that was seen by the middle schoolers at whom the ""Scary""franchise is aimed?) leads to loads of repetitive scenes in a dance studio. There are sight gags about what ballerinas eat for lunch (a single Cheerio in one case; a huge pizza in another) Molly Shannon embarrasses herself stumbling around as a tutu-wearing performer who drinks a martini during a workout and one routine turns into a naughty pole-dance segment. In a ""Cabin in the Woods"" segment college kids hack off their own limbs when a magic spell is recited and Snoop Dogg is spotted carrying around a spliff the size of a canoe. The ongoing ""Paranormal"" spoof keeps circling back to mean-spirited jokes about a portly Latina housemaid who makes a stinky in a toilet scene and wears an overly revealing swimsuit. Also she beats a pinata tries to run over her employer with a lawn mower and sleeps with her vacuum cleaner. Zucker and Proft If the National Hispanic Media Coalition ever calls pretend youre not home. Down at the bottom of the comedy barrel where the slimy gray algae-like stuff lives Thats where this script came from. If you must go to ""Scary Movie 5"" be sure to bring an iPad with you. That way you can watch a better movie on it.

Daily Edition Login to download Scary Movie 5 Film Review 1001 AM PDT 4/12/2013 by Frank Scheck FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS The Weinstein Company Spoofing movies ranging from Black Swan to Mama to Paranormal Activity this installment of the profitable series is woefully painfully unfunny. TWITTER This latest installment of the horror movie spoof franchise is mainly notable for its Charlie Sheen/Lindsay Lohan cameos. You have to at least give Scary Movie 5 points for timeliness. This latest installment of the horror movie spoof franchise manages to deliver parodies of movies as recent as last weeks Evil Dead remake not to mention one that hasnt even been made yet (Fifty Shades of Grey). But those points immediately are subtracted by the fact that this Wayans-less installment doesnt manage to wrest a single laugh from any one of them. PHOTOS Scary Movie 5 Premiere Lindsay Lohan Charlie Sheen Promote the Paranormal Parody Directed by Malcolm D. Lee and co-written and produced by the venerable David Zucker (Airplane The Naked Gun) it demonstrates that the latter has definitely lost his comic mojo. The film which opened without being screened for the press unspooled to an opening-day audience that produced a deafening silence. If youve seen the trailer youve already seen the most notorious segment in which Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan enthusiastically -- if sadly -- make fun of their naughty personas in a clownish opening sex sequence riffing on the Paranormal Activity series. Its pretty much all downhill from there. The filmmakers desperation is evident from the fact that a good chunk of the running time is devoted to spoofing the recent Jessica Chastain starrer Mama. While that film was indeed a sleeper hit it hardly seems memorable enough to warrant such sustained treatment and indeed the comic payoffs are nil. PHOTOS The 20 Most Dramatic Child Star Transformations Otherwise its mostly a jumbled-together collection of sketches riffing on a disparate group of films including Rise of the Planet of the Apes Inception Cabin in the Woods Paranormal Activity and its sequels and even Black Swan. Resembling the sort of lame bits relegated to the closing minutes of Saturday Night Live when airtime must be filled and featuring narration by a Morgan Freeman sound-alike their collective lameness is numbing. Ashley Tisdale and Simon Rex anchor the films loose plotline mashing together parodies of Mama and Black Swan and while both performers certainly are game neither possesses the comic chops necessary to keep the proceedings afloat. The rest of the cast consists largely of major and minor celebrities popping in for silly cameos including Heather Locklear Terry Crews Mike Tyson Snoop Dogg Katt Williams Jerry OConnell Usher and others too numerous to mention. Only Molly Shannon -- playing a demented accident-prone ballerina -- manages to impress with her sheer determination to be funny even if she never quite succeeds. Director Lee periodically speeds up the film to produce a comic effect though sadly not enough to reduce its seemingly interminable 85-minute running time. The inevitable outtakes during the closing credits indicate that the performers at least managed to get some laughs out of the experience. Opens Friday April 12 (The Weinstein Co.)
