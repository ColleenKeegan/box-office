That line could serve as Kaufmans mission statement He writes about men who are trapped in their own minds either literally as in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind or through some metaphorical metaphysical meta-everything framework like Adaptation or Synecdoche New York. Cusacks Craig Schwartz is a professionally and emotionally frustrated puppeteer who discovers an escape route into the headspace of actor John Malkovich. The still boyish-faced Cusack sports a ponytail a patchy five oclock shadow and a hollowed-out expression that suggests he aged all 14 years since The Sure Thing in one day. He like costar Catherine Keener and director Spike Jonze does some of his best work here and Being John Malkovich is much more than a primer on a writers pet themes. Its a delightfully absurdist occasionally off-putting masterpiece of existential voyeurism that runs on its own off-brand logic. Even 13 years later it still feels as if the film sprang fully formed from Kaufmans mind only to take the back door into ours. The EXTRAS are a rabbit hole of their own. Theres a new behind-the-scenes documentary a dialogue between Malkovich and funnyman-slash-fan John Hodgman and a commentary track not from Jonze but from frequent Kaufman collaborator Michel Gondry (who directed Eternal Sunshine). It offers viewers exactly what everyone in the film is searching for a different perspective.

This maze-like journey by first-time feature-helmer Spike Jonze and scribe Charlie Kaufman touches on questions of love identity sex gender and penetration with a playful perverseness few other semi-mainstream productions would ever dare to dabble in. Hot musicvideo and commercials creator Spike Jonze makes a bracingly original entry into the feature-film arena with ""Being John Malkovich"" which also marks a no-less-auspicious bow for writer Charlie Kaufman whose first produced screenplay this is. A metaphysical comic love story about the desire to be someone else and the urge to control another persons thoughts and actions this maze-like journey touches on questions of love identity sex gender and penetration with a playful perverseness few other semi-mainstream productions would ever dare to dabble in. Devilishly inventive and so far out there its almost off the scale the film should see smart urban audiences turning out in force but may be too dark and eccentric to conquer a broader marketplace. U.S. opening is set for Oct. 29. While its title might sound bizarre anywhere other than on a docu portrait of the actor the work itself goes beyond odd taking its unconventional outlandishness to hilarious dizzying heights. Yet what makes it so fresh is the decision to treat even the storys most surreal inventions in real rather than fantastical terms placing Kaufmans peculiar universe in everyday New York City with characters who register each surprise development as merely another unusual but not incredible crease in the fabric of their lives. At the center of this world is talented but esoteric street puppeteer Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) whose darkly sexual marionette dramas prove unpalatable to most NYC pedestrians. Equally unfulfilling is his marriage to frumpy pet-store staffer Lotte (a startlingly deglamorized Cameron Diaz) whose priorities revolve primarily around kitty litter deliveries and the neuroses of her traumatized chimp one of a menagerie of animals inhabiting their dingy apartment. Driven by lack of income to find a job Craig answers an ad for a nimble-fingered filing clerk in offices located on a Manhattan buildings low-ceilinged 7-1/2th floor which legend has it was constructed to ease the stigma suffered by the original owners height-challenged inamorata. At orientation he meets neighboring office employee Maxine (Catherine Keener) and is immediately smitten but she is far too cool a customer for the love-struck loser. The two colleagues form a business partnership when Craig stumbles on a weird discovery. Behind a cabinet in his office is a sealed door that opens onto a cramped sticky tunnel. Exploring this he is sucked into the head of John Malkovich from where he views the world through the actors eyes for precisely 15 minutes before being spat out into a ditch off the New Jersey Turnpike. Before long Craig and Maxine are charging thrill-starved New Yorkers 200 a pop for entry into this portal to Malkovichs brain. But complications arise when Lotte takes the trip and is instantly hooked on ""the Malkovich ride."" Inside the actors skin Lotte finds a real sense of herself for the first time and begins to consider sex reassignment. Her feelings are further confused when Maxine sets up a date with Malkovich and Lotte is party to her seduction while Maxine also responds with heightened pleasure to the awareness of a womans eyes desiring her through Malkovichs. As the two womens unorthodox sexual relationship takes wing Craig takes matters into his own hands entering Malkovichs brain and using his puppeteering skills to take up permanent residence. From within he completely redirects the now helpless actors career and for a time finds bliss with Maxine. The beauty of Kaufmans endlessly resourceful script is not just the originality of its humor but that the ideas never let up. And despite the sheer absurdity of much of it the story retains its own unique logic. This is due in great part to Jonzes shrewd decision to focus on the performances and the exhilaratingly paced material letting the actors and script shine rather than investing heavily in visuals. The director has declined to go the expected route for a musicvid savant of concocting elaborate slick visuals or heightened atmosphere instead opting for functional simplicity that if anything is often a little drab and underlit. But d.p. Lance Acord -- who like most of the principal technical team comes from musicvideos and has collaborated frequently with Jonze in the past -- perfectly mirrors the materials tone with his jumpy manic camerawork as does Eric Zumbrunnens tight editing. Working with actors in fully developed roles for the first time Jonze draws rich enjoyable performances from the entire cast. Each character goes through his share of bumps and changes and the four leads fully embrace the materials wild spirit. While it takes time to recover from the shock of seeing Diaz so dismally plain with shapeless outfits and a bad perm the actress again demonstrates her verve and razor-sharp comic skills as she falls for Maxine is thwarted by her husband and responds with fierce determination to secure happiness at any price. In the showier role of smart-mouthed cynical Maxine Keener she brings plenty of sexy attitude poise and bite. And the actress ultimately uncovers some softer angles when true love finally finds Maxine. Craig is the kind of edgy idiosyncratic role Cusack -- also dressed-down and with scruffy beard and hair -- does best. His nervous energy propels the puppeteer from being an almost Kafkaesque figure in dementia-land to a manipulator and amoral exploiter of the situation to a pitiable quietly tragic soul in the audaciously twisted melancholy final act which is both disturbing and poignant. Malkovich reveals himself to be a terrific sport taking shots at his own career (almost no one can remember a movie he was in except ""that one about the jewel thief"") his screen persona even his looks and body and more fancifully his murky past when Lotte chases Maxine through the various levels of his subconscious. Its hard to imagine many established actors game enough to allow themselves to be presented in this often questionable way and equally hard to imagine another name that would fit the conceit so snugly. Malkovichs aloof slightly stoned and at times inhuman demeanor makes him elastic enough to be inhabited and gradually taken over. His puppet dance of despair with Craig pulling the strings from inside is a classic. Mary Kay Place has some extremely funny scenes as the office receptionist who chronically mishears everything said to her as does Orson Bean as the companys enigmatic 105-year-old sex-obsessed president. Sean Penn and Brad Pitt among others pop up in brief amusing cameos while Charlie Sheen gets some major laughs especially when advising the incensed Malkovich not to let go of ""the hot lesbian witch thing.""

Comments click to enlarge Being John Malkovich Recommended Watch on Netflix Rated R  112 minutes  2012 This outrageous comic fantasy may not sustain its brilliance but it keeps cooking for so much of that time that I dont have many complaints. The first feature of both screenwriter/executive producer Charlie Kaufman and director Spike Jonze it charts the complications that ensue when an out-of-work puppeteer (John Cusack) gets a filing job on the surrealistically cramped seventh and a half floor of an office building where he discovers a hidden tunnel that allows its occupant to become actor John Malkovich (playing himself natch) for 15 minutes before being ejected onto the New Jersey Turnpike. Things get even wilder when the filing clerk and his wife (Cameron Diaz as a pet-store employee) both get the hots for the same woman (Catherine Keener) who has comparable lust for the wife as long as shes inside Malkovich. Whats great about this lunatic farce (1999) isnt only its premises about sexual and professional identity but also the spirited way the actors and filmmakers flesh them out.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

Starring John Cusack Cameron Diaz Catherine Keener Orson Bean Mary Kay Place and John Malkovich. Directed by Spike Jonze. Written by Charlie Kaufman. (R. 112 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Hollywood is so financially overextended and so afraid of losing its investment so were told that nervy risk-taking movies dont stand a prayer of getting made. Theres plenty of evidence to support that argument -- ""Random Hearts"" for one -- but also in recent weeks a number of releases that contradict it. ""Fight Club"" ""American Beauty"" and ""The Straight Story"" are all the products of original voices -- and so is ""Being John Malkovich"" a wonderfully demented fantasia that opens today. Directed by Spike Jonze who made his mark with music videos and commercials and written by the previously unproduced screenwriter Charlie Kaufman ""Malkovich"" is inspired madness. After its over one wants to yell ""Thank you I believe"" at the screen. A metaphysical journey about identity gender creativity and the urge to transform oneself ""Being John Malkovich"" looks as if it were hatched by Terry Gilliam or Lewis Carroll on drugs. Its silly unpredictable and completely faithful to its perverse vision. John Cusack stars as Craig Schwartz a bearded longhaired street puppeteer whos down on his luck. Stuck in a stale marriage to Lotte (Cameron Diaz) a pet-shop employee and depressed about the lack of public regard for his delicate marionettes Craig takes a file-clerk job on the seventh-and-a-half floor of a New York office building. The seventh-and-a-half floor? Thats right. Wedged between two floors and approachable only by bringing the elevator to an emergency stop between floors the seventh-and-a-half floor has 5-foot-3-inch ceilings low rent and a feeling of the surreal. Hired by a crazy old man (Orson Bean) Cusack is alone in the office one night when he discovers a secret portal like a rabbit hole behind a file cabinet. He enters it slides down a slippery tunnel and winds up inside the head of actor John Malkovich (who plays himself) for 15 minutes. Kaufmans script is so illogical and curlicued so wonderfully for eign to the templates that Hollywood screenwriters all seem to follow that its impossible to see where all this is going -- which is a great feeling for the viewer. Nearly unrecognizable in a frizzy mousey-brown wig Diaz is intrigued by Cusacks Malkovich downloads. She tries it and gets so aroused when Malkovich makes love to sexy Maxine (Catherine Keener) -- shes ""inside"" him when this happens -- that she considers sexual reassignment surgery. Part of the pleasure in watching ""John Malkovich"" is seeing these actors at full creative throttle and knowing how much they relished the insanity of the script Cusack as the Kafka-like Schwartz; Diaz as his nerdy animal-fixated spouse; Keener as a glamorous trickster whose motives cant be trusted; and Mary Kay Place as Beans daffy secretary. But its Malkovich who has the most fun. Spoofing oneself is usually therapeutic but for Malkovich whose image is bound up in the flesh-eating characters he plays and the reputation hes earned as an intellectual prima donna it must have been ecstatic. In this movie he gets to poke fun at his persona at show business pretension and at actors in general with their pampered egos and clubby shop talk. In the movies piece de resistance Malkovich appears in a dream sequence as multiple versions of himself. Its a brilliant piece of seamless digital illusion the most impressive I can remember since Gary Sinise lost his legs in ""Forrest Gump."" But ""Being John Malkovich"" doesnt bog down in allegory. Its tremendously entertaining and probably worthy of repeat viewings. ..

Its set in a casually surreal version of the everyday where puppeteer Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) discovers a portal that sucks him into the mind of John Malkovich. Before long Craig his wife (Cameron Diaz) and a diamond-hard office vixen (Catherine Keener) are using Malkovich as a host body layering their identities on top of his. Director Spike Jonze works in a bustling yet deadpan pretzel-logic style so that you never question the reality of what youre seeing.

"Being John Malkovich | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; being-john-malkovich ) Being John Malkovich (United States 1999) A movie review by James Berardinelli These days critics (and non-critics for that matter) are fond of complaining about how multiplexes are populated by cookie-cutter motion pictures that follow safe formula-derived patterns designed to please audiences who want a different version of a story they have already seen dozens of times. And while theres some truth to the maxim that ""theres nothing new under the sun"" Being John Malkovich tries hard to be the exception. Admittedly the themes addressed by the movie - those of identity celebrity and manipulation - are familiar but the manner in which director Spike Jonze and writer Charlie Kaufman address them is fresh and inventive. Im not arrogant enough to claim that nothing like Being John Malkovich has ever previously been committed to celluloid but if it has been I havent seen it. This is the first movie to be directed by Jonze who cut his teeth doing TV commercials and music videos. Unless youre isolated from all aspects of pop culture youve probably seen his work. (He also has one of the four primary roles in Three Kings.) As is the case with many of the so-called ""MTV filmmakers"" Jonze displays a strong sense of style. However unlike most of his contemporaries he does not rely on quick cuts and visual gimmicks. He has sound mature cinematic instincts. Kaufmans script is not constrained by viewer expectations. For about 110 minutes he pushes the envelope taking us in new and unexpected directions. Every time I thought I recognized where Being John Malkovich was headed the movie surprised me. The screenplay is as funny as it is clever. Some of the jokes are of the ""big laugh"" variety but few are representative of the cheap shots and dumb humor that have become commonplace in 90s offerings. Being John Malkovich revels in smart comedy instead of wallowing in the opposite. And alongside the laughter theres plenty of material for contemplation. Cinematically speaking this is a well-balanced multi-course meal. The premise is as intriguing and offbeat as it is difficult to adequately describe in a few sentences. Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) is a master puppeteer but after being out of work for a while he is becoming restless so his wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz) suggests that he swallow his pride and get a job - any job. Since he has nimble fingers he decides to apply for a position as a filing clerk. The job in question is on the 7 1/2th story of a New York City office building - a floor that is four feet from carpet to ceiling (""low overhead"") and can only be reached by stopping the elevator between the 7th and 8th stories and prying open the door with a crow bar. After a successful interview with the firms sex-obsessed carrot juice-drinking 105 year old boss Dr. Lester (Orson Bean) Craig gets the job and meets his co-workers including Floris (Mary Kay Place) the hearing-impaired secretary and Maxine (Catherine Keener) a sexy brunette who allows Craig to flirt with her even though she has no interest. One day while searching for a lost file behind a cabinet in his office Craig discovers a hidden door. Venturing through it he is sucked into a portal that lands him inside the brain of John Malkovich where Craig can look out the actors eyes and experience what he feels. Its the ultimate in voyeurism but it doesnt last for long. 15 minutes after Craig enters Malkovich the portal spits him out dropping him from the sky and landing him alongside the New Jersey Turnpike. He returns home and tells his wife who wants to try the portal for herself. He also reveals the secret to Maxine and while he ponders ""the metaphysical can of worms"" the portal unleashes she sees it as an opportunity to sell tickets 200 a pop to be John Malkovich for 15 minutes. For those who think I have given away too much this is only the background and basic setup presented in the films first half-hour. Being John Malkovich ventures into much deeper and stranger territory. I havent written anything about the chimp who goes to a psychiatrist for feelings of insecurity or the man who like a modern day Dorian Gray has plans to live forever. Somehow Jonze and Kaufman blend all of these disparate elements together without missing a beat. Unlike most comedies which go for laughs without worrying about depth Being John Malkovich has both. The film raises questions about the nature of identity and how some people are only completely free when their real self is hidden behind a mask or beneath a costume. With Craig as a puppet-master and Maxine playing him like a musical instrument issues of manipulation rise to the surface. How much of what we do in our day-to-day lives involves attempting to pull the strings of others or having our own strings pulled? Being John Malkovich also addresses the appeal of stardom with greater impact than Woody Allens Celebrity. Certainly some of those willing to pay to enter the portal are interested in having a temporary personality transference but others want the experience of being a star. In fact taken as a whole this could all be seen as a commentary on the crafts of acting (taking on an alternative identity) and directing (manipulating others). Beyond that there are issues of ethics and commercialism (will we exploit anything?) as well as addiction (some customers become addicted to the experience). And for those who like to see the dark side of things the film offers unsettling threads about the annihilation of identity and the price of immortality. Is this too much material for one movie? Not with Jonze at the helm and a capable cast in front of the cameras. That cast is headed by John Cusack one of Hollywoods most underrated actors. Cusack (last seen in Pushing Tin) has astonishing versatility and is able to thoroughly inhabit the skin of any character he plays. Craig isnt the most pleasant of men - during the course of the film he does some unconscionable things - but Cusack is so effective that we form a tenuous bond with him anyway. As Lotte Cameron Diaz is almost unrecognizable. Like her male co-star she disappears into the character (with the help of an atypical hair style). Catherine Keener for years the muse of filmmaker Tom DiCillo (Living in Oblivion) continues to show why she has always deserved the greater exposure she is starting to get. Then theres John Malkovich who plays an exaggerated fictionalized version of himself. Although that might initially seem like a simple role it isnt especially considering that Malkovich must re-invent himself as a man being possessed by others. His performance is flawless mixing a version of the world-weary actor with an imitation of John Cusack and a touch of Steve Martin from All of Me. Jonze and Kaufman chose Malkovich as the title character because they wanted someone who is both well-known and a little elusive. Having appeared in the likes of The Killing Fields Dangerous Liaisons In the Line of Fire Of Mice and Men and The Man in the Iron Mask Malkovich is certainly a familiar face but his varied choice of roles has kept him just out of the realm of superstardom. And its refreshing to see an actor participate in the process of parodying his personality and image. The movie is surreal precisely because Jonze plays everything straight. The characters are not aware that theyre in some kind of distorted reality gazing through the looking glass darkly. Like Alice they try to believe three impossible things each day before breakfast. This approach aids in the willing suspension of disbelief drawing us into the story rather than distancing us and forcing us to gaze at the proceedings from the outside looking for seams in the plot. Being John Malkovich is one of those rare cinematic experiences that works on one level or another for nearly everyone who sees it. It is a triumphant debut for Spike Jonze.
