Cuss words fly off the screen the body count is sky high and one sequence may set the world record for exploding heads on screen. But somehow its all very polite and British; its a punch to the face washed down with a spot of tea.The film follows an independent international intelligence agency that doesnt sacrifice good manners while saving the world.""We are first and foremost gentleman"" Kingsman Harry Hart tells a young recruit and since Hart is played by Colin Firth -- who indeed makes quite the dashing action hero -- theres no trouble believing him.That young recruit is Eggsy whose father was being groomed for Kingsman duty when he was killed during training. Played by the magnetic Taron Egerton Eggsy is slightly rough around the edges but a born leader.While Eggsy works his way through the Kingsman recruitment process Hart and crew are dealing with Richmond Valentine a billionaire hatching a scheme for world domination. Samuel L. Jackson who with his prominent lisp and askew New York Yankees cap is clearly channeling hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons is a gas as the super villain who wants to wipe out the planet but just cant stand the sight of blood.In his previous films ""Layer Cake"" ""Kick-Ass"" and ""X-Men First Class"" Vaughn showed his flare for style kinetic action and big-budget extravaganzas. Here he combines all three and puts a meta post-modern spin on the spy genre like a flip fun James Bond for the millennial set.""This isnt that kind of movie"" characters say at two different points in the film one of the ways Vaughn winks at the audience. Theyre empty words if they theyre not followed through but the sequel-ready ""Kingsman"" has a few good tricks up its designer sleeve.

"Spying Spongeing Singing Kingsman The Secret Service Sponge Out of Water and The Last Five Years << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Spying Spongeing Singing Kingsman The Secret Service Sponge Out of Water and The Last Five Years 20th Century FOX Movies February 17 2015 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Sometimes its easy to spot a directors favorite scene. Your pulse may not always go up but its clear his does. The filmmaking changes. It was obvious for instance when David Fincher finally came alive in Gone Girl. The bucket of blood hed been careful not to spill for 100 minutes finally tipped over. The films style loosened up just as the mystery got good and lurid. Kingsman The Secret Service has a moment like that. One of the movies elite English spies -- the one played by Colin Firth -- drops in on a Kentucky church teeming with flamboyantly racist rednecks who turn into killer drones before a melee erupts. Why it has broken out and what Firth is doing at the center is a plot point for someone else to spoil but the orchestrated chaos shoves the filmmaking into a new dimension of violence. The parishioners and Firth attack each other with guns knives an ax a pole and whatever else isnt nailed to the floor. The camera makes promiscuous leaps among attacking bodies the way a virus invades a host. Firth swerves and pirouettes from fighter to fighter wielding something weaponized. Hes got big black glasses and for about two minutes he does such smooth battle that his hair is barely mussed. This is a variation on the joke told every time Firth uses his legs and fists to clean house in this movie King George the Thug-Zombie Slayer. By this point theres already been a long skydiving sequence but the energy in this brawl is akin to being sucked out of a plane at 30000 feet. Maybe its fun but it feels like a hazard too You cant breathe. Im sure director Matthew Vaughn would say he loves all of Kingsman which is based on the Secret Service comic-book series and features a young U.K. street tough named Eggsy (Taron Egerton) training to become a superagent. However that church brawl feels like a sequence that for Vaughn justifies making the rest of the movie. He wants it be a violent rock-and-roll aria. But unlike say any one sequence in a Transporter film either of the Raid extravaganzas the preposterously amazing Old Boy or The Yellow Sea the ""Crazy 88"" climax of Kill Bill Vol. 1 or the Guggenheim ramp shootout in The International Vaughns mayhem moves so fast that its hard to believe. Firth seems insulated from harm by both his cool and the effects. Any sense of triumph is purely at the level of stuntcraft. The rest feels less than the sum of the moving parts. The sequence for one thing is almost ancillary to the story. For another Firth is the only actual character in this video game. If this is an aria it feels lip-synched. Vaughn is a synthetic director. He must know it. The opening lick of Kingsman belongs to Sting singing ""I want my MTV"" from Dire Straitss ""Money for Nothing."" There are jokes about 24 and the Bourne movies and constant allusions to James Bond. The nostalgic shots of boom boxes evoke the more convincingly loose Guardians of the Galaxy and the satire here would be better off in the hands of a director like Edgar Wright who can take a good script and give it strangeness and heart. This film is a lot of zero-calorie flash that makes Guy Ritchie look like John Frankenheimer. Ritchie is insufferably derivative but at least his commitment to masculinity can be sexy. His best capers are hung while Vaughns pants feel stuffed. Vaughn does have a competence that tends to elude a filmmaker like Ritchie. Kingsman is well oiled. Its trapdoor opens smoothly and the vengeful jaunts to Eggsys fraught home life which he shares with his mother and her abusive mobster husband satisfy the itch for life-size justice. These strands manage to meet up loosely in a primary plot in which the Kingsman agency is trying to stop a lisping telecom mogul named Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) from fulfilling his evil-genius plan for a kind of ecological apocalypse via SIM card. Theres a nice (if overlong) finale and I was happy anytime the dancer Sofia Boutella showed up with spiked and bladed feet as Valentines chic henchwoman. After a while though it all starts to repeat itself even Boutellas high-speed fights. Egerton is rough and mildly charismatic. For a lot of the movie he dresses like Samuel Jackson -- caps sweat suits swagger. In the big black glasses he gets from Kingsman he looks like Gary Oldman back when Oldman was one of the most exciting weirdos in the movies. Without them he looks like a DiCaprio or a Wahlberg. Egerton is Welsh. Its surely only a matter of time before Hollywood makes him do so many American accents that he will start to seem as body-snatched as this ironically respectable incarnation of Firth does. Firth has aged into dull stiffness. I miss the version of him that seemed to smell garbage even when he wasnt starring in it. Now everything seems to smell the same. Jackson is the best thing in the movie. He is given couture streetwear and uses that lisp the way some villains use cats. This is something you want from a star for him to relish being in a game or a cartoon. Is it weird that this is yet another movie in which the primary heroes are white guys and the deadliest people are brown or female (or both)? Of course it is. But Jackson can usually get you past -- or least complicate -- a movies casual racism. He could be phoning in his performance but hes having a very good time instead. He slays without ever having to go into a racist church.  Paramount Pictures A steady diet of animated American movies gets you acclimated to a certain kind of regulated rambunctiousness. Sometimes Ill leave a Bolt a Rio or a fiasco like The Nut Job wondering why more of these movies arent crazier. Part of what made people so happy about The Lego Movie is that in its way it got close to out-there. The SpongeBob SquarePants movies go further. The team thats been doing the SpongeBob show on Nickelodeon has been at it for the better part of a decade. Out-there is now pretty much baked into every frame. This is how you wind up with Sandy the cartoon squirrel who uses deep-diving gear to live underseas turning into an actual squirrel in The SpongeBob Movie Sponge Out of Water and pretty much staying that way during the climax. Once again poor bellicose Plankton tries to swipe Mr. Krabss secret Krabby Patty burger recipe. But the recipe vanishes which brings riots and dystopia to the organisms of Bikini Bottom. Mr. Krabs believes Plankton is lying when he says he doesnt have it but SpongeBob knows Plankton is telling the truth and the two enemies are more or less banished together until everyone figures out that the recipe is up on dry land at which point the movies animation style switches from a charming unsophisticated flatness to expensive-looking computer-generated stuff. Sponge Out of Water is a big improvement over the previous soggy 2004 film. It has a nutso druggy quality that makes it feel like its up to more than its plot. Having Antonio Banderas play a live-action pirate named Burger Beard is one thing; having him narrate from an ancient storybook in his exuberant Spanish accent is proof of the movies arbitrary hilarity. Adults make up 40 percent of the shows audience but kids also seem to get the Burger Beard jokes. Whats true of Jackson in Kingsman could quadruple here for Banderas. Ive never seen an actor work this hard this embarrassingly without actually embarrassing himself. The man is an international treasure. Its obvious that the people responsible for Sponge Out of Water feel free. They work with pleasing literalism musicality and an abundant appetite for throwaway lines and puns. (""Unleash the condiments"" says Mr. Krabs while at war with Plankton. ""With relish"" says SpongeBob.) The alacrity is so contagious that even a few of the many fart jokes smell pretty good. I never know what I want from commercial animated entertainment but I do know that I like being able to suspect that -- by the standards of the competition -- its makers might be outlaws and lunatics.  RADiUS/TWC The Last Five Years is a musical drama about Cathy and Jamie a New York couple that meets marries and breaks up after his writing career takes off and her acting career goes in the opposite direction. Its bland earnest and receptive and in order to capture it the director Richard LaGravenese thinks he needs more crane shots than Citizen Kane. But Anna Kendrick and Jeremy Jordan play the couple and as performers they make the movie seem fuller than it is. Jordan is a theater actor and a lot of his singing appears to be on the spot. Hes aggressive eager and spontaneous. Kendrick is more tentative but you sense that its because she has put thought into the part. Her voice isnt big or rich but she controls it and can act out a song. When shes not singing in a movie now youre almost disappointed. The Last Five Years is based on a 2001 stage musical by Jason Robert Brown whose conceit is that Cathy and Jamies songs are duet-less with one exception and time is shuffled. LaGraveneses adaptation puts Cathy and Jamie together a lot so you notice that his numbers are all about how great life is and hers take up the cause of the unhappy and long-suffering. The gimmick doesnt work in the film because the story begins at the end. You know the relationship will never work. But even if it began at the start youd know which way things are headed. Standing side by side or in each others arms they sing every which way but together.

In ""Kingsman The Secret Service"" directed by Matthew Vaughn and based on the popular comic book Firths Harry Hart is an expertly tailored gentleman who is actually a ranking member of a hush-hush spy organization modeled on the Knights of the Round Table dedicated to eradicating bad guys. Chief bad guy here is Samuel L. Jacksons Valentine a billionaire entrepreneur with a nefarious plan to curb global warming by eradicating large swaths of the worlds population.

(Honestly the puns just write themselves). PHOTOS Most romantic movies of all time The Last Five Years 3 stars We already know the talented Anna Kendrick can sing lush fairy tales and a cappella pop songs. Now she expands her range to original love songs in this inspired (and at times melancholic) musical based on the off-Broadway show. In the opening scene Kendricks Cathy cries on her bed in NYC and laments that her husband Jamie (Smash alum Jeremy Jordan) ""is gone."" She then melodically chronicles the couples story going backward while her ex croons his perspective from the beginning of the courtship. Detailing the ups and downs of romance the two enchant on screen. (Kendrick gushing about her new engagement is a joy to behold.) Just make a note The wall-to-wall singing may cause some squirming. Jaap Buitendijk Kingsman The Secret Service 2 1/2 stars A dapper British spy uses nifty gadgets and winking humor to defeat a megalomaniac. Yup director Matthew Vaughn (Kick Ass X-Men First Class) aims high with his slick James Bond throwback. For the most part he succeeds; but prepare to be shaken -- not stirred -- by the obscene violence splayed across the screen for entertainment value. Plot time Harry (Colin Firth) recruits a lad from the wrong side of Londons tracks (Taron Egerton very appealing) to join the Kingsman an espionage agency. Their goal is to stop an evil techie (Samuel L. Jackson who bellows in a distracting lisp) from achieving global genocide. Yeesh. The set pieces manage to be both bold (the would-be recruits must skydive) and old (a barrage of explosions). A bloody shoot-out set in a Kentucky church scored to Lynyrd Skynyrd however is just cold. PHOTOS More new movies Anne Joyce The Rewrite 2 1/2 stars Hugh Grants latest comedy is as comforting and well-worn as a heavy blanket on a freezing day. He stars as a jaded has-been screenwriter forced to take a professor job at a college in upstate New York. Soon the usual quirky mix of faculty and students fixate over this new guy from Hollywood as if hes Brad Pitt -- then try to teach him a thing or two about life. Passages of this predictable flick could use a you-know-what. But you know what? Two decades after Four Weddings and a Funeral Grant can still charm with just a sputter and a smile. And the flicks supporting players including J.K. Simmons Allison Janney and Marisa Tomei (as a late-bloomer student) class it up. (Also available on VOD.)

Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size Christopher Orr Feb 12 2015 Culture ""Manners maketh man."" Thus does an immaculately tailored Harry Hart (Colin Firth) instruct a gang of rude working-class hoods in a London pub early in director Matthew Vaughns Kingsman The Secret Service. He then proceeds to lock the doors and administer a lesson in manners with extreme prejudice. Said lesson begins with his grasping his umbrella by the point and using the curved handle to scoop up and sling a pint glass hockey-like into the cranium of the lead hood. Matters proceed from there roughly as one might expect.Its a winning joke the tasteful well-appointed gentleman delivering a bloody beat down with the aid of his umbrella--John Steed as reimagined by Quentin Tarantino. At the same time its an awfully tricky proposition to maintain this contradiction--extolling the virtue of good manners in the most ill-mannered way possible--for the length of an entire feature film. Vaughn succeeds to a remarkable degree. Kingsman is a movie addicted to its own excesses with cultural undercurrents that are frequently reactionary bordering on retrograde bordering on reprobate. But its also a tremendous amount of fun.Related Story Secret Agent Mom How Allegiance Reinvents the Female Spy The movie is pitched simultaneously as a sendup of early Bond and his imitators--The Avengers The Man from U.N.C.L.E. and even Get Smart--and as an over-the-top exemplar of the genre. (There are even gags involving Jason Bourne and Jack Bauer.) The gadgets are self-consciously ridiculous--among its other properties Harts umbrella is bulletproof--and the plot purloined to a considerable degree from Moonraker involves a diabolical mastermind with dreams of global dominion. Knowing riffs are scattered about liberally on martinis (to be stirred for 10 seconds while glancing at an unopened bottle of vermouth); on vintage brandy and scotch (at 58000 a bottle the 1962 Dalmore featured in the film is among the most expensive in the world); on haberdashery; and most of all on bespoke suits. In one of the movies most genial touches the headquarters of Kingsman the titular ""independent international intelligence service"" is accessed through an eponymous high-end tailor shop on Savile Row. (The pass code should you require it is ""Oxfords not brogues."")The story progresses along two lines. Early on Kingsman loses one of its agents code-named ""Lancelot"" (Jack Davenport very good in a too-small part). Each of the remaining agents all of them named for knights of the Round Table (Hart is ""Galahad"") is required to submit one potential recruit all of whom will compete under the lethal tutelage of ""Merlin"" (Mark Strong) to be the next Lancelot. The recruits are a passel of toffee-nosed upper-class prigs save for Harts selection ""Eggsy"" (Taron Egerton) the hard-case semi-hooligan son of a former agent. Meanwhile as Eggsy and the others make their way through Kingsman training a global threat gradually reveals itself in the form of a billionaire Silicon Valley industrialist Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) with a novel remedy for global warming.Kingsman is based on a graphic novel by Mark Millar--the third to be made into a motion picture following the guilty pleasure Wanted and the teen-superhero flick Kick-Ass. (The latter was also directed by Vaughn though less winningly; call me old fashioned but I prefer that my ultraviolence not be administered by--and upon--children.) Vaughn seems in some way to have been born to direct this movie. He grew up believing his father to be the actor Robert Vaughn with whom his socialite mother was involved at the time of his birth. Only later did he learn that his father was actually George de Vere Drummond a minor English lord and godson to the late King George VI. In Kingsman these two patrimonies are intertwined Napoleon Solo meet the British aristocracy.The violence may frequently be extreme but its engineered with exceptional wit and inventiveness.Vaughns direction here is operating at a higher level than in any of his previous films which also include Layer Cake and X-Men First Class. The violence may frequently be extreme but its engineered with exceptional wit and inventiveness. A free-for-all bloodbath set in a Kentucky church is a particular marvel of choreography and spatial geometry set cunningly to the guitar solo from Lynyrd Skynyrds ""Free Bird."" Its exactly the kind of bravura sequence Edgar Wright might dream up if he were high on meth.In the central role Firth is precisely as gin-martini-dry as one might hope and relative newcomer Egerton represents a genuine find as ""Eggsy."" Strong gets a nice brogue on as Merlin and while its true that Michael Caine could play his role as the head of Kingsman--""Arthur"" naturally--in his sleep this is not entirely a bad thing. Jackson meanwhile gets far greater comic mileage than seems possible out of the tech mogul Valentine a lisping villain made ill by the sight of blood. The female characters alas are given considerably less to do Sophie Cookson makes scant impression as one of Eggsys fellow recruits; and Sofia Boutella who plays Valentines right-hand woman is notable principally for her razor sharp prosthetic legs--an ironic updating (and not the only one) of Rosa Klebbs switchblade shoes in From Russia with Love.Kingsman The Secret Service will not be to all tastes. Some of its excesses land with hilarious aplomb (a parade of literally hundreds of human heads popping like mushroom clouds set to the patriotic standard ""Land of Hope and Glory"") while others fall flat (an out-of-left-field sexual provocation involving a Scandinavian princess). I am hesitant to call it as a good movie. But for those open to its tea-and-testosterone premise I would gladly describe it as a very very good bad movie.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip.

"Kingsman The Secret Service | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; kingsman-the-secret-service ) Kingsman The Secret Service (United Kingdom 2015) A movie review by James Berardinelli Kingsman The Secret Service is to the 60s British spy movie genre what Kick-Ass is to todays motion picture superhero movement. Part homage part cartoonish spoof and part high-energy actioner Kingsman feels right at home with the likes of Kick-Ass and Layer Cake two previous efforts from director Matthew Vaughn. (The latter stared a pre-007 Daniel Craig and is sometimes credited for getting the actor the coveted Bond role.) Based on a comic book Kingsman occasionally betrays its roots but Vaughn has adapted it to fit his unique approach. Fast-paced with a morbid sense of humor and copious pop culture references Kingsman breezes along at a nice clip until it gets a little bogged down during its final third. The films most obvious inspiration is the Connery Bonds (which are openly referenced) but theres an equally evident call-out to another spy series. Michael Caine the star of The Ipcress File and a couple of other Len Deighton Harry Palmer adaptations plays the role of Arthur Kingsmans version of ""M."" There are also unsubtle references to The Avengers (the 60s TV series not the Marvel movie) and even (would you believe?) Get Smart. Vaughn has a lot of fun frolicking in this playground doing unexpected things and engaging in a head game of one-upsmanship with Steven Spielbergs Raiders of the Lost Ark. One could argue that the only thing missing from Kingsman is a cameo by a Roger Moore or Timothy Dalton although Moore at least is present in spirit. The unlikely action hero of this piece is Colin Firth who has done a lot in his career but has never previously attempted a mimicry of a David Niven/Moore amalgamation. His Galahad is the perfect embodiment of the gentleman spy who takes out a gaggle of bad guys without rumpling his suit. Its said that Firth did about 80% of his own stunts and this allows Vaughn to shoot the fight scenes without having to resort to a lot of quick cuts and trick camera angles. The double-branched story follows Galahad as he investigates the possible nefarious actions of a multi-billionaire philanthropist named Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson affecting a lisp) while teaching his protege Eggsy (Taron Egerton) what it means to be a member of the elite off-the-radar cadre of spies called ""The Kingsmen."" These are modern-day knights whose armor is an impeccably tailored (bullet-proof) suit. Galahad calls The Kingsmen an ""international intelligence agency operating at the highest level of discretion."" In order to become a Kingsman Eggsy has to go through a Hunger Games-like contest of elimination where the last one standing gets the vacant seat at the not-so-round table. Most of the candidates are like Edward Holcrofts Charlie - sneering and superior. Eggsy quickly becomes attached to the approachable Roxy (Sophie Cookson) one of only two women seeking to earn the nom de Kingsman of ""Lancelot."" (The previous bearer of that title having been vivisected by a woman with blades for feet.) Kingsman features three memorable sequences. The first is a bar brawl in which Galahad displays his talents to an amazed Eggsy. The second occurs in a Kentucky church where the darker side of human nature comes to the fore. And the third... well lets just say it involves a lot of mushroom clouds. Vaughn goes over-the-top in the right measure. Its a difficult thing to satirize Bond because so many aspects of the 007 series skate close to self-parody. So Vaughn pokes fun without going too far and without losing sight of the fact that at its heart Kingsman isnt intended to be a straightforward comedy. The films irreverence is its greatest asset as when Valentine and Galahad confront each other with a knowing nod toward how that encounter would have been handled by Connery. Firth representing Kingsmans marketable star is joined at the top of the marquee by international newcomer Taron Egerton whose previous credits have primarily been on U.K. TV. He has plenty of sex appeal and charisma and looks great in a suit. Samuel L. Jackson surprisingly tones down his usual tendencies to play a megalomaniac with a scarily credible motivation. Mark Strong who often plays a heavy gets a few opportunities to shine as Merlin Arthurs right-hand man. Small supporting parts go to Mark Hamill as a rumpled professor and Jack Davenport as an unflappable agent. Although Kingsman is for the most part an enjoyable experience it runs too long. There are times especially during the second half when it feels repetitive. There are also some pacing issues during the training sequences - the movie works best when Firth and Egerton are sharing the screen rather than when theyre doing their own things. (Galahad conveniently ends up in a coma for a while to limit the amount of back-and-forth switching necessary.) Its difficult to assess what could have been pruned from Kingsmans final cut but a little tightening up might have resulted in a stronger sharper film. Still when it comes to affectionate spy movie spoofs this is one of the best and certainly more engaging than anything offered by the Austin Powers series.

Its for us the great unwashed bloodthirsty audience. 378 Shares Share 324 Tweet 53 Share 0 Share Email Print Share Colin Firth in Kingsman The Secret Service. Photo Jaap Buitendijk/Twentieth Century Fox The kind of action extravaganza only a truly fallen civilization can produce Kingsman The Secret Service will both entertain you and send you running to the shower. Adapted (loosely) from Mark Millar and Dave Gibbonss gleefully brutal 2012 comic book The Secret Service with in-your-face visual bravado by Matthew Vaughn (who also turned Millars Kick-Ass into a similarly deranged and beautiful killfest) this tale of a young tough getting introduced into a clandestine espionage network takes a familiar setup and upends it with comically stylized brutality.A The film knows its story is an obvious one. ""Have you seen Trading Places Nikita Pretty Woman?"" Colin Firths Harry Hart (code name Galahad) asks our hero Eggsy (Taron Egerton) a council estate kid with a chip on his shoulder. Eggsy hasnt heard of those films but he has heard of My Fair Lady one of Kingsmans less intuitive reference points. Due to a long-ago incident that left Eggsys father dead Harry has been waiting for the opportunity to try and turn the troubled young man into a Kingsman -- a secret group of international super-spies formed out of a centuries-old order of tailors. The Kingsmen are run out of a Savile Row shop and they pay as much attention to their bespoke suits and fine Scotch as they do to their elaborate gadgets and bulletproof umbrellas -- theyre a fantasy of weaponized Englishness.A Most of Kingsmans story involves Eggsy and several other young initiates attempts to make it through the orders intense training program at the end of which only one of them will be allowed to join. There is a ticking clock however Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) a colorful internet-billionaire-cum-climate-change-doomsayer is going around the world hatching an evil plot that involves kidnapping celebrities and politicians while giving everybody free SIM cards that may or may not have some mind-altering properties. Were not sure what Valentines ultimate aim is but hes clearly up to no good He cant stand the sight of violence so his dirty work is done by the young lithe Gazelle (Algerian actress Sofia Boutella) who has deadly razor-sharp blades instead of feet and who already killed one of the Kingsmen in the films opening scenes. More than any other director Vaughn (who also made the well-liked X-Men First Class) has found a cinematic analogue for the intricacy of the comic-book page. Kingsman is full of elaborately orchestrated violence and acrobatic stunt work shot in fast sinewy CGI-enhanced long takes that push and pull our perspective this way and that. Its all very silly and not really meant to be taken seriously but as the story gets more and more brutal something strange happens We start to care for these cartoonish characters and this absurd scenario. A similar thing happened in Kick-Ass the films willingness to kill off key characters to send the story spinning off in ever-darker directions all the while not letting up on its cheekiness made us think anything was possible -- that a crazy person might be behind the camera. It has the curious effect of investing you in what happens onscreen as if that might be the only way to maintain your sanity. Theres a funny somewhat intentional disconnect at the heart of Kingsman. The films central conceit is that to be a super-spy you not only have to be a lethal killer you also have to be a debonair gentleman (or gentlewoman) one with unflinching moral rectitude -- a philosophy the film itself casually and knowingly betrays with the gonzo joy it takes in its many scenes of tongue-in-cheek violence. But would a gentleman cackle with laughter at the sight of a bad guy grimacing in disgust as his fellow henchmans tooth flies past him in slow-motion? Or of a man getting stabbed in the face while watching his own severed hand fly past him? Or of a racist preacher getting a flagpole stuck through his mandible? No Kingsman is not a film for gentlemen. Its for us the great unwashed bloodthirsty audience. Its an immaculately engineered laugh-out-loud appeal to our own depravity.A Tagskingsman the secret servicemovie reviewmovies Share on Facebook Tweet this Story Top Stories Winona Ryder and the Power of Meta-Casting 8 Essential PokA(c)mon Go Tips Youall Want to Know Mike Birbigliaas Quest to Create Comedy of Communion Most Viewed Stories Constance Wu Slams Matt Damonas Great Wall Film for Perpetuating a aRacist Mytha 37.4k Shares Share Tweet LeBron James Reportedly Stopped Justin Bieber From Performing at the RNC 90 Shares Share Tweet John C.

That winking self-aware line gets tossed off more than an hour into ""Kingsman The Secret Service"" and its really meant to tell us This is not your fathers British spy movie. Be aware. Also maybe be alarmed. During the first hour of the film there have been several nods to the good old days of 007 ""The Avengers"" and their American brothers. Rosa Klebbs shoe pops up and Maxwell Smart gets a nod. There is a secret spy headquarters (a la ""The Man From U.N.C.L.E.) and of course a billionaire megalomaniac who poses a global threat. But then things take a turn. A really nasty nihilistic turn that involves a hero butchering dozens of (moderately) innocent people - this actually comes before the movies warning - and then a quick slide into carnage that doesnt end until ... Well small spoiler alert. But if your idea of a good joke is a movie in which a jug-eared African-American president is revealed as a murderous traitor and then has his head exploded this is the film for you. But the assassination of a real-life person wasnt funny when it happened in ""The Interview"" and its no funnier here where its merely the most obvious off-note in a movie full of them. Thats too bad because there are some great ideas in ""Kingsman"" (which was based on a comic-book series). Theres the private spy agency modeled after the Knights of the Round Table and populated by very proper English gentleman. Their tools include bulletproof bespoke suits and weaponized umbrellas. They know all the right vintages (and never spill a drop even while killing a roomful of assassins.) And then there are the stars including the fine Colin Firth as our heros mentor (and Michael Caine old arry Palmer himself as Firths boss) Samuel L. Jackson (less felicitously) as a supervillain with a lisp and Sofia Boutella as a double amputee with razor-sharp blade-legs (which feels like a fever dream Takashi Miike and Quentin Tarantino once shared). Thats all in the first hour and its fine. But then that man makes his announcement and it becomes a different kind of movie. A lot of that has to do with the filmmaker Matthew Vaughn an English aristocrat who had a huge success with ""X-Men First Class"" but whose other slumming sadistic movies include ""Kick-Ass"" and ""Layer Cake."" Like those films this one seems to have an almost sexual fascination with the super-slow penetration of flesh by bullet blade and sharp object. It relishes low-class ugliness. This includes his supposed young hero Taron Egerton the novice spy were supposed to take to. Hes what the Brits call a Chav - someone with a fondness for tracksuits bad jewelry and stupid lager-fueled crime. But as Egerton plays him he only seems thick not tough - and not anyone we particularly want to root for. Still the plot pushes us along and Vaughn knows how to amp up drag out and otherwise hard-sell an action scene. Theres a good one when Firth singlehandedly takes out a pub full of toughs another one when Egerton faces Boutella. The opening sequence (which actually quotes a Miike film ""Ichi the Killer"") is a doozy. But for someone like Vaughn too much is never enough. And so when theres a chance for mass slaughter he takes it (and scores it to... ""Free Bird""?) And then takes it again and sends what seems like the worlds population at each others throats. As well as suggesting most of the worlds leaders are traitors and throwing in a winking sodomy joke for the sexist fade-out. No one is suggesting that the 007 films -- particularly the Connery/Moore ones -- didnt feature their own sexism sadism and stereotypes. But they didnt revel in them. They certainly didnt think the world was an ugly place. They tried to give you a few thrills and leave you walking out of the theater happy. ""This isnt that kind of movie."" Ill say. Ratings note The film contains violence gore strong language brief nudity and substance abuse. Kingsman The Secret Service (R) Fox (129 min.) Directed by Matthew Vaughn. With Colin Firth Samuel L.

Brad Wheeler The Globe and Mail Published Friday Feb. 13 2015 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Feb. 13 2015 1200AM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Matthew Vaughn Written by Jane Goldman and Matthew Vaughn Starring Taron Egerton Colin Firth and Samuel L. Jackson Classification 14A Country USA Language English From Matthew Vaughn with love.Kingsman The Secret Service is a lively dashing and amusing motion picture that smartly spoofs and slyly celebrates the James Bond spy-film franchise. Based on the graphic novel The Secret Service the cheeky but compelling-enough thriller from the Kick-Ass and X-Men First Class filmmaker Vaughn (the son of an English aristocrat and a husband to a German supermodel) also takes a blunt stab at British snobbism with a talented but lower-class young fellow as an aspiring international man of mystery. Jon Stewart announces hes leaving The Daily Show; NBC suspends anchor Brian Williams for six months; Cops called to Bobbi Kristina Browns home a week before she was found in bathtub. (Feb. 11) AP Video Video Video ShowBiz News Jon Stewart leaving The Daily Show Director Niobe Thompson says his crew was the first to film traditional breath-hold divers in a war-torn part of the Philippines. His series ""The Great Human Odyssey"" premieres Thursday on CBCs ""The Nature of Things."" CP Video Video Video Documentarian travels globe for Great Human Odyssey series That would be Unwin - Eggsy Unwin a son of an operative but not an unlikely candidate to carry a poison pen himself. Hes played charismatically by Taron Egerton an English actor with whom you are currently unfamiliar. This should change.Those with any awareness about the world of shaken martinis colourful villains and inefficient henchmen will catch on fast to the Bondsian allusions - a mannered gun pose here; Sean Connery in C Minor music there. There are gadgets galore but not kitties galore. (Eggsy befriends an adorable pug he names ""J.B."" not after the big-screening James Bond or Jason Bourne but televisions time-pressed Jack Bauer.)The excellent Colin Firth is Harry Hart a long-time member of a wealthy crime-fighting operation unaffiliated with any government. Code-named Galahad - Kingsmen are named after the knights of the Round Table - Hart is the natty chap who grooms Eggsy as a gentleman spy. At the underground espionage academy Eggsy is up against others some of whom are privileged jerks.Firth as Hart is an elegant killer - a right Gene Kelly dancing with a bulletproof brolly. Speaking of choreography Harts nemesis is Richmond Valentine played by a jaunty lisping Samuel L. Jackson. Like any Ian Fleming rogue megalomaniac worth his weight in idiosyncrasies gold and good manners he tangos with his suave secret-agent counterpart.But here comes the fun Valentine brings up classic spy-action genre mentioning cliche elements and then dismissing them. ""This aint that kinda movie"" he says. Maybe not but Valentine does have the requisite lair exotic sidekick killer and outlandish scheme. Hes a tech billionaire and disheartened ecocampaigner whose desire to save Earth involves a deep culling of the population. The exaggerated plot involves the kidnapping of celebrities and dignitaries and a mind-warping mobile app designed to induce a worldwide murderous rage among citizens.We get a mid-movie taste of the mayhem complete with slo-mo slaughter set against the best Lynyrd Skynyrd soundtrack choice since Saturday Night Special from The Longest Yard.I wont tell you if the Valentines Day massacre happens but I can say that a naughty princess gets it in the end. And that Kingsman in the end is an appealing film about upward mobility and learned nobleness that nearly rises to a 007 level - a classy comic homage with a fanfare finale that is literally mind-blowing.

Craig along with director Sam Mendes (Skyfall this years Spectre) essentially rebooted Bond giving us a 007 for a new era. Gritty angry dangerous grounded. But lets be honest hes not exactly what youd call a fun guy. Lately it feels like weve lost some of the cheesy zany brilliant Bond of yesteryear movies that mixed ludicrous gadgets and over-the-top villains with legitimate high stakes and white-knuckle peril. Bond was getting too goofy to be sure - Roger Moores Moonraker is still the franchises cornball low point - but perhaps weve overcorrected a tad. And perhaps Kingsman The Secret Service is a response to that. Loosely based on the graphic novel series by Mark Millar (Kick-Ass Wanted) and directed by Matthew Vaughn (Kick-Ass X-Men First Class) Kingsman is James Bond meets well Kick-Ass with a dash of Pygmalion and a pinch of Harry Potter. Its not necessarily trying to reinvent Bond so much as reminding us that there are other games in town. And they can be just as enjoyable to play. Mobile users click this link A smart but wayward young Londoner nicknamed Eggsy (newcomer Taron Egerton) finds himself taken under the wing of dapper Harry Hart (the absolutely perfect Colin Firth) an old comrade-in-arms of Eggsys long-dead father. The lad soon discovers as the audience has learned through a couple of prologue scenes that Harry is part of a secret spy organization called the Kingsmen. Operating out of a high-tech lair beneath a Savile Row tailor shop and with codenames based on Arthurian legend the Kingsmen are an independent agency one that is currently investigating the apparent abduction of public figures from across the globe. And from the looks of things the eccentric lisping tech billionaire Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) is somehow involved. Mobile users click this link The brash but naturally talented Eggsy is invited to try out for the Kingsmen competing against a small group of other young hopefuls (including a sole female initiate gamely played by Sophie Cookson) for a single opening. Meanwhile Harry and his compatriots start to suss out Valentines plan one that will see our reliance on technology bring about a culling of the human race. Its a stylish cocky silly and exciting movie and demands not to be taken seriously even when it has something serious to say. From an extended hyper-violent melee inside a Kentucky church to a Swedish princess offering frank sexual favours in exchange for rescue Kingsman The Secret Service comes about its R-rating honestly making Kick-Ass look tame by comparison. But it does this while riffing on British spy movies and British kid-lit with spoofery so spot-on that it sometimes eclipses its targets. Seriously Algerian dancer Sofia Boutellas Gazelle - a henchwoman with razor sharp leg prosthetics - is cooler than most Bond villain subordinates. With lesser talents or weaker resolve Kingsman could have been too light and silly to make an impact and the movie does start to groan a bit under the weight of its own compounded absurdity in the final third. But with powerhouse supporting players like Michael Caine and Mark Strong helping to ground it and an intoxicating mix of over-the-top violence and slick charm its unlike anything weve seen before. If the franchise gods are smiling this wont be the last time we see Bonds younger bloodier rivals.

Twentieth Century Fox Twentieth Century Fox Kingsman The Secret Service    (out of five) Director Matthew Vaughn Cast Colin Firth Taron Egerton Samuel L. Jackson Rated R (sequences of strong violence strong language some sexual content) Running time 129 min. By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 457pm on Thursday Feb. 19 2015 Thursday Feb. 19 2015 Thursday Feb. 12 2015 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram There may be a good film buried inside Kingsman The Secret Service a well-cast and sporadically entertaining but overly long exceedingly violent and ultimately perplexing spin on the comic-book action movie.Based very loosely on a graphic novel Mark Millar and David Gibbons The Secret Service it supposes that theres a super-secret British spy agency where not only are the agents well-trained and well-equipped but exceedingly well-dressed. Working out of what appears to be an exclusive mens shop on Londons stylish Savile Row the Kingsman organization turns grooming into warfare; many of the sartorial choices are actually weapons in disguise. True James Bond has done this before but these guys make Bond look like Paul Blart Mall Cop.Colin Firth is lead agent Harry Hart (aka Galahad) a man who feels guilty because one of his crew was killed in the Middle East a decade ago. While visiting the mans widow and young son he gives the boy a number to call if he ever gets into real trouble.Flash forward to present day where Mom is involved with a low-life and the kids a working-class street tough who goes by the name of Eggsy (an impressive Taron Egerton) and seems to be on the fast track to nowhere. If he doesnt change his ways hes going to be in prison for a long stay or worse.In fact its from jail -- after a run-in with the cops -- where Eggsy remembers Harrys words from years before. The next thing he knows hes Eliza Doolittle to Harrys Henry Higgins (theres actually a funny My Fair Lady joke in the film) and is in training for a slot as a Kingsman.As it turns out not only does he have to worry about his Kingsman competition -- most of the others vying for the opening are posh-accented upper-class brats who look down on him -- but saving the world too. Harry and Eggsy have to take down the evil Internet billionaire named Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) who has a Pinky-and-the-Brain-style plan to dominate the planet through SIM cards.The plots of these types of film matter little; their appeal rests in the execution and this is where Matthew Vaughn ( X-Men First Class Kick-Ass) working from a script he co-wrote with Jane Goldman stumbles. What is supposed to be both over-the-top and funny -- such as in the movies most obnoxiously violent scene when Harry turns into a killing machine inside a fundamentalist church -- ends up just wearying.Violent action scenes can work when theres a sense of the skillful choreography ( The Raid) or a sense of humor ( Pulp Fiction). Kingsman has neither one of these elements going for it.Theres a strong cast of supporting players such as Michael Caine and Mark Strong but theyre mostly wasted.A movie like this needs a good colorful villain but Valentine doesnt cut it. Jackson is one of those actors who can turn trash into treasure but not this time. Part of the problem is that inexplicably he speaks with a lisp. If its supposed to be funny its not.Ultimately theres little to care about in Kingsman a spy film thats all dressed up with no place to go.Cary Darling 817 390-7571Twitter carydar Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

"Suave yet with comic book energy Kingsman goes spying - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Suave yet with comic book energy Kingsman goes spying Kingsman The Secret Service Jaap Buitendijk / 20th Century Fox Colin Firth portrays a revered spy who becomes a mentor to a hard-luck youth (with mad parkour skills) played by Taron Egerton. Colin Firth portrays a revered spy who becomes a mentor to a hard-luck youth (with mad parkour skills) played by Taron Egerton. (Jaap Buitendijk / 20th Century Fox) Betsy Sharkey With Kingsman on the scene James Bond encounters a bit of competition in the spy spoof genre ""Kingsman The Secret Service"" starring a natty Colin Firth a newbie Taron Egerton and a naughty Samuel L. Jackson is a dry wry sendup of the 007 world which is itself a sly dry sendup of the spy game.Directed by ""Kick-Ass"" action specialist Matthew Vaughn with slightly more vigor than necessary and a shade less restraint than needed its a bit too too to be ""brilliant"" as the Brits say. But its not half bad either. Based on a comic book -- isnt everything these days? -- the idea spun from Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons ""The Secret Service"" is as rich with possibilities as the spy genre is for spoofing. So is the bizarre weaponry always good for a laugh in ""Kingsman"" from basics like a lethal fountain pen or cigarette lighter/hand grenade to the exotic Oscar Pistorius-style racing blades of one sultry Gazelle (Sofia Boutella) that can slice a man in half in mere seconds.Unlike the fire power foot power and fisticuffs however the script doesnt always hit its mark. Still the screenplay by Vaughn and Jane Goldman (""Stardust"") is at times wickedly witty having fun not just with spies but the British obsession with social class. If you can forgive the failings for at least some of the two-plus-hour running time ""Kingsman"" serves up its share of entertaining froth. Much of that is due to Firth the films true star. The Oscar-winning actor who tends to be equally engaging in comedy and drama plays the most revered Kingsman Harry Hart code name Galahad. Firth displaying a charming bravado genuinely seems to be having the time of his life playing a well-turned-out action hero. Kingsman The Secret Service Matthew Vaughns love letter to spy cinema Gina McIntyre Gina McIntyre In keeping with Knights of the Round Table code names the Secret Services leader is Arthur (Michael Caine). The villain is Valentine (Jackson) a mega-billionaire obsessed with global warming and old movies which seem to be his reference point for all things. Seeded through the film its a conceit that movie buffs will likely enjoy.Valentine has a nefarious ""solution"" for the planets temperature problems that involves free SIM cards implanted in the populace so the world can text and talk as much as its wants. And he can rid the world of its texters and talkers when he wants. There are few actors who can walk the bad guy/funny guy tightrope with quite the aplomb of Jackson. Every time the actor shows up in the midst of the mayhem of ""Kingsman"" he never fails to dole out a little comic relief. Gazelle is his girlfriend bodyguard and No. 1 warrior. The special effects used to allow the actress to spin slice and dice any adversary with those prosthetic running blades is quite amazing though whether it represents a step forward for people with disabilities or not is a tough call. (Boutella is not disabled herself.) Like Bond ""Kingsman"" is British-suave from its agents tailored suits to its machine-gun-quality bumper shoots. It begins with a mission gone wrong. An agent whose lower-class background Arthur always questioned explodes while saving Harry. His son Eggsy is left with an apology and a medal of honor with a phone number etched on back than can only be used once in an emergency.Seventeen years later the death of another agent opens the way for a single replacement candidate to the Kingsman elite. Harry sponsors a now grown-up Eggsy after he bails him out of jail -- that one emergency call finally used. Weve gotten a glimpse of what the intervening years have been like for Eggsy basically a hard-luck life for him and his mum a vicious stepdad and a talent for the extreme obstacle sport parkour.The street-wise Eggsy is the only commoner in the Kingsman training class. The rest are upper-crust guys Oxford or Cambridge grads and a smart pedigreed lass named Roxy (Sophie Cookson). Sparks between Eggsy and Roxy will fly.The man putting the kids through their paces is code named Merlin (Mark Strong). He is also Harrys best friend in the Service and along with Harry becomes Eggsys mentor. Hes the solid center you need in the kind of stormy conflicts kicked up in these films.Much of the movie is about making Eggsy into a spy. No need to look for movie allusions; Harry offers up ""Trading Places"" by example Eggsy comes back with ""My Fair Lady."" Needless to say its a process to take Eggsy from street thug to gentleman spy.The action is over the top and excessive and exceptionally well staged with director of photography George Richmond doing a bang-up job making it remarkably easy to follow. The fighting style keeps the emphasis on comedy the blood is almost nonexistent and the exploding heads at times are ethereal abstractions and quite stunning to watch. Production designer Paul Kirby costume designer Arianne Phillips and music maestros Henry Jackman and Matthew Margeson keep the lightness brightness and wryness going.It all helps remind us that ""Kingsman"" is very much rooted in the comic book fantasy realm.

Jaap Buitendijk/Twentieth Century Fox hide caption toggle caption Jaap Buitendijk/Twentieth Century Fox Harry (Colin Firth) helps Eggsy (Taron Egerton) try out for a position with Kingsman a top-secret independent intelligence organization. Jaap Buitendijk/Twentieth Century Fox Midway through the hip new spy comedy Kingsman The Secret Service ultra-classy secret agent Harry Hart (Colin Firth) infiltrates a sermon at a hate-spewing rural America congregation clearly modeled on the Westboro Baptist Church. Their sign out front proclaims ""America Is Doomed"" and their pastor leaps across centuries worth of bigotry in a single bound. As Harry tries to quip his way out a supervillains mind-control plot springs into motion and he is compelled to murder all the churchgoers for no reason in a brightly photographed slow-motion frenzy of martial arts gadgeteering and impalement set to the Southern rock anthem ""Freebird."" The sequence teeters from cheeky to brutal its humor from winking to shocking both building on and desecrating the careful mythology the film has established. When a well-dressed man shows off a grenade disguised as a cigarette lighter he will eventually use it; we just dont expect it to be used so inelegantly or that the inelegance will itself become the joke. This anti-gag is at the heart of Kingsman which keeps finding new ways to surprise with well-trodden territory. The stylish super spies are members of a privatized espionage group founded more than a century ago by tailors to the wealthy and the idea that menswear is keeping the worlds peace is just the tip of this films cult-ready sensibility. The gadgets including an umbrella that doubles as both a shield and a projectile launcher are designed around the Kingsmen model of the ideal gentleman an expressly polite and impeccably dressed do-gooder who never wears brogue shoes and will only lay waste to a group of hoodlums after hes already asked them nicely to leave. Years after one of their members is killed in battle his street tough son Eggsy (relative newcomer Taron Egerton) finds his way to their latest recruiting class under Harrys tutelage. But first Harry will have to help Eggsy find the gentleman within. It looks so easy when Colin Firth wears that suit. Theres naturally a villain at large Valentine a tech mogul (arent all modern supervillains?) whose world domination plot involves mind control transmitted via cell phones and computer chips planted in the minds of the global elite like the worlds worst Davos conference. Hes played by Samuel L. Jackson Americas favorite shouter with an odd lisp. Valentine wants to wipe out the human race but he cant stand the sight of blood and the funniest part of Jacksons performance is that he plays this trait unironically he cowers from his own gun even as he shoots it. A sultry sidekick with razors for legs named Gazelle (Sofia Boutella) is the most Bond-ian character to have never appeared in a Bond film. But the films true conflict is between Eggsy and the oppressive posh legacy of the organization hes trying to enter. During the long training sequence Eggsy dodges jeers from his Oxford-educated rivals resenting the class system even as he tries to climb it. But he isnt above whooping with joy over Spy 101 stunts like skydiving during a plummet which director Matthew Vaughn shoots with dizzying speed. There are so many activities the film drops the ball on a few like a seduce-the-target training exercise that ends before realizing any comic potential. Vaughn and his co-writer Jane Goldman are the umpteenth filmmakers to send up the spy genre but theyre also cleverly subverting the cult of Bondian Brit sophistication. After years of watching Michael Caine play the benevolent elder its refreshing to see him here as a stubborn crank obsessed with bloodlines and absurd tests of character. When he commands Eggsy to shoot an adorable dog we do a double-take -- what if we cant trust everything Michael Caine says after all? -- and Vaughns frenzied close-ups keep the scene from going off the rails. Vaughn also made Kick-Ass which like Kingsman is an R-rated genre sendup based on a Mark Millar comic book. (Question for the class How popular do sendups need to be before they become the establishment instead of merely mocking it?) This film maintains the same irreverence and ultraviolence but blessedly without the sour tone of Kick-Ass The joke rarely goes too far. Even so scores of innocents still die as in most save-the-world movies these days. Surely if gentlemen have rules about brogue shoes they have rules about this sort of thing.

Comments click to enlarge Kingsman The Secret Service Video Rated R  129 minutes  2015 Director Matthew Vaughn delivers another comic book adaptation in the vein of his 2010 hit Kick-Ass full of bright surface pleasures and mean-spirited violence. A working-class thug in his early 20s discovers that his late father belonged to a secret crime-fighting organization; recruited by one of the old mans colleagues (Colin Firth) he joins a mission to stop a crazy software entrepreneur (a lisping Samuel L. Jackson) from killing most of the worlds population. The filmmakers clearly sympathize with the villain as much as the heroes encouraging us to delight in the murder and mutilation of Arabs British proles American religious fundamentalists and a number of world leaders. Like a good comic book artist Vaughn packs the frames with eye-popping detail and theres an infectious creative energy to his violent action sequences but the films hatefulness is hard to stomach.

"Kingsman a gleefully subversive spy thriller spoof review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesKingsman a gleefully subversive spy thriller spoof review Kingsman The Secret Service has enough subversive wit solid casting and inventive action sequences to please action fans.Eggsy (played by newcomer Taron Egerton) learns to be a super-spy under the tutelage of dapper Harry Hart a.k.a. Galahad in Kingsman The Secret Service.By Bruce DeMaraEntertainmentThu. Feb. 12 2015Kingsman The Secret ServiceStarring Taron Egerton and Colin Firth. Co-written and directed by Matthew Vaughn. 129 minutes. At GTA theatres. 14A. Its been a long time since weve seen an action hero -- The Avengers John Steed in the swinging 60s -- wield an umbrella for anything other than warding off the wet stuff.Then theres Gazelle clearly inspired by James Bond movies of decades past a supervillain hench-wench who uses her super-sharpened blade runner prosthetic legs to slice and dice with lethal efficiency.Article Continued BelowBut just when youve got Kingsman The Secret Service pegged as an homage to the campy spy thrillers of yesteryear director Matthew Vaughn who co-wrote the screenplay takes the film to some unexpected places.Sure our hero gets the girl in the end. But in Kingsman youre never going to guess exactly how its going to happen.One of the best things about the film -- based on the 2012 comic series by Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons -- is how thoroughly and gleefully Vaughn revels in subverting the form and conventions of the genre.Yes there are scenes that feel clunky and much of the dialogue certainly could have upped its wit and banter quotient. And at nearly two hours and 10 minutes the film occasionally tries ones patience. But theres enough action suspense and all-around fun to make Kingsman The Secret Service an unexpectedly enjoyable ride.The film opens with a bit of necessary back story involving the death of a Kingsman agent during a Middle East misadventure before arriving in the present day with Harry Hart a.k.a. Galahad seeking to recruit the dead agents son into the super-secret ""independent international intelligence agency.""That turns out to be Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin a lower-middle class no-account (played by Taron Egerton) whos only discernible skills appear to be pickpocketing and driving backward at high speed.At the same time Eggsy is competing with a cadre of upper-middle class toffs for a coveted spot at the agency supervillain Richmond Valentine is hatching a plot to save the Earth from the effects of climate change and the virus that threatens to destroy humanity.Its a pleasure to see Samuel L. Jackson dial down the volume portraying Valentine with a comically over-the-top lisp a villain who plots mayhem on a global scale but has no stomach for violence.The reliably watchable Colin Firth is both Savile Row suave and in trim fighting form as Galahad. He needs to be since the role requires two very energetic action scenes.Vaughn has done well in casting relative newcomer Egerton (who bears a resemblance to Ewan McGregor) as Eggsy. Hes not too obviously good-looking and he manages to convey the protagonists personal growth as he graduates from sneering callow youth to budding superspy.Providing solid backup is Mark Strong playing Merlin (the Bond equivalent of gadget master Q) with a Scottish burr and Michael Caine in his umpteenth-and-counting role as spy chief Arthur.Vaughn has constructed some dazzling and memorable action scenes and the films protracted conclusion is both suspenseful and satisfying.Sure theres a lot of codswallop about class differences and what defines a real gentleman and a subplot involving Eggsys hated stepfather that feels unnecessary. But with its engaging cast and unexpected plot twists Kingsman displays enough energy and playfully subversive wit to please action and nonaction fans alike.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Photo Credit TNS / 20th Century Fox advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A young British thug is recruited into an elite spy ring. Rated R (violence language some sexual content). BOTTOM LINE Firth gets his 007 on in this bloody stylish spy romp. CAST Colin Firth Samuel L. Jackson Taron Egerton LENGTH 208 ""Money for Nothing"" the 1985 song by Dire Straits featuring Sting opens the action comedy ""Kingsman The Secret Service."" For some reason its blaring from a boombox belonging to two Middle Eastern soldiers a scene that eventually leads us to a suicide bomber a weeping widow and a dashing British spy who mixes martial arts with fine scotch. The less you try to make sense of ""Kingsman The Secret Service"" the more youll enjoy this freewheeling preposterously violent action comedy from the creators of ""Kick-Ass."" Based on the comics by Mark Millar and directed by Matthew Vaughn the movie is a jumble of genres references and influences. It cant decide whether its a send-up of James Bond or a bloodier version of ""Austin Powers"" but its stylish energetic and entertaining throughout. advertisement | advertise on newsday Everything in ""Kingsman"" is a nod or a wink including its fine cast. The films title refers to a ring of gentleman spies who sport bulletproof bankers suits chunky glasses and lethal umbrellas. Colin Firth is pitch-perfect as noble agent Harry Hart code name Galahad and Mark Strong plays Merlin the rings tech-savvy figure. Their leader Arthur is played by Michael Caine -- an in joke perhaps since Caine helped invent the rings square-cool dress code in 1965s ""The Ipcress File."" Driving the plot is Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin a brilliant but thuggish teen (played with laddish spirit by Taron Egerton) whom Harry taps as a new recruit. Coincidentally a technology mogul named Richmond Valentine is attempting to conquer the world using smartphones. Played by Samuel L. Jackson with an absurd lisp (""Im tho thorry you had to thee all thith"") and decked out in Flavor Flavs wardrobe Valentine makes for an enjoyably loopy villain. The violence in ""Kingsman"" ranges from spectacular (a serio-comic bloodbath in a church) to ridiculous (heads exploding in time to an Elgar march). Its all a giant cartoon thats short on real human emotions and completely uninterested in women (Sophie Cookson plays Roxy another new agent) but the spiffy visuals and cheeky humor help compensate. Keep an eye on the crackpot Professor Arnold -- its the first major film role in years for the once and future ""Star Wars"" icon Mark Hamill. 247 MoviesKingsman The Secret Service trailer Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it Eggsy (Taron Egerton) and Arthur (Michael Caine) bond in ""Kingsman The Secret Service."" (Jaap Buitendijk/AP) By Michael OSullivan February 12 2015 The two heroes at the center of the cheeky highly entertaining English espionage thriller ""Kingsman The Secret Service"" -- one a master spy and the other his protege -- are a study in opposites. The more senior of the pair played by Colin Firth is a dapper James Bond-like super-agent code-named Galahad. He wears custom suits speaks in a plummy refined accent and carries an umbrella that performs double duty as both firearm and when opened a bulletproof shield. His young student on the other hand is a rough-around-the edges Cockney lad with an arrest record and an affinity for ballcaps and sneakers. Played by Taron Egerton Eggsy (as he is known to his friends) is not far from the loutish British youth demographic known as ""chavs"" despite an innate sweetness and intelligence that belies his upbringing by a single mother (Samantha Womack) in council housing a.k.a. the projects. Like this odd couple the film is also a mix of the juvenile and the sophisticated. Based on a series of comic books by Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons its both a sharp send-up of spy movies and a silly celebration of action movie cliches in the Quentin Tarantino mold. Though less bloody than that auteurs films ""Kingsman"" even boasts Samuel L. Jackson as the villain Richmond Valentine a billionaire Internet entrepreneur with a diabolical plan. His henchwoman an amputee femme fatale named Gazelle (Sophia Boutella) has prosthetic legs -- Oscar Pistorius-like running ""blades"" -- that are quite literally lethal weapons. The plot is at once ridiculous and smart. Though Valentine is intent on human annihilation he means to achieve this goal not with a doomsday weapon but with an object whose ubiquity and potential for evil is becoming all too clear in the real world these days the cellphone. How this unfolds is one of the films several pleasures so Ill leave it at that. A major subplot concerns Galahads mentorship of Eggsy who has been recruited by Galahads employer the fictional Kingsman an independent intelligence agency founded after World War I by members of the gentry. Eggsy must compete against eight candidates for a single slot that has opened in the ranks after the gruesome death early in the film of a veteran Kingsman operative (Jack Davenport). Colin Firth as Galahad prepares to dispatch some local toughs. (Jaap Buitendijk/Twentieth Century Fox) Much of the film concerns Eggsys boot camp-like training in which he must demonstrate -- and in some cases learn for the first time -- resourcefulness teamwork patience loyalty manners and of course the suave communication skills of a secret agent at least the cinematic kind. One funny scene features Eggsy and his fellow recruits in a bar where they have been assigned to use their ""NLP training"" or neuro-linguistic programming -- yes its a real thing -- to attempt to seduce the same woman with a blend of high-brow psychological manipulation and time-tested if cheesy pick-up lines. Its one of several clever self-aware examples of ""Kingsmans"" tendency to mix the new and the old. After Eggsy adopts a puppy a requirement of Kingsman training he names it J.B. -- not for James Bond or Jason Bourne as Galahad suspects but for Jack Bauer. When Eggsy is being fitted for dress shoes -- and learning the difference between oxfords and brogues -- Galahad tells him in a nod to ""Get Smart"" (itself a parody of spy movies) that ""in the old days they had a phone in the heel."" Of course this being a modern movie theres loads of violence though most of it is bloodless and surprisingly balletic. One massacre set in a conservative Christian church in the American Deep South is a master class in cartoonish fight choreography. Another set piece featuring a room full of exploding human heads looks like technicolor Orville Redenbacher popcorn. Its more comedic than disturbing. Not all gags however pop. Jacksons lisping way of speaking for example while funny at first quickly becomes annoying. And a dirty joke near the films end which portrays Eggsy as way more lecherous than we have been given to believe -- and less interested in his fellow Kingsman recruit Roxy (Sophie Cookson) than some may have hoped -- comes across as crass. Directed by Matthew Vaughn who with co-writer Jane Goldman previously adapted Millars ""Kick-Ass"" ""Kingsman"" delivers on its promise of escapist fun with a touch that alternates between Galahads old-school polish and Eggsys roguish charm. Like the rookie who knows that you have to make a few mistakes while following the master the movie shrugs off its missteps with a wink and a smile that makes them easy to forgive. R.

(AP Photo/20th Century Fox Jaap Buitendijk) Photo Jaap Buitendijk Associated Press Kingsman review A tip of the hat to Bond Get Smart 1 / 4 Back to Gallery ""Kingsman The Secret Service"" makes up its own rules as it goes along. It asks to be taken seriously then turns ridiculous then brings out the horn section to indicate the hoped-for triumph of good then shows peoples heads exploding in a CGI sequence intended to be funny. It tries to get by on charm and like a lot of movies and people who make that attempt ""Kingsman"" does have charm -- just not enough. It tells a story involving a society of secret agents that operates out of a high-end London tailor shop and it must be noted that even though the movie opens in 1997 Colin Firth does not once appear in the baggy trousers of that era. From the beginning he wears the more form fitting skinny-legged pants common to today probably because Firth knows he looks good in them. Lets just say it that man can wear a suit. A riff on British spy movies it stars Firth as Harry who is asked by his leader -- Michael Caine of course -- to find a potential recruit to replenish their ranks. Harry decides on the son of the man who saved his life years before. Eggsy (Taron Egerton) is a working-class kid with no prospects a horrible home life and nothing to lose. The movies depiction of working-class despair is committed. Its about the only thing that director Matthew Vaughn doesnt regard as funny. ""Kingsman"" shows characters discussing spy movies and deciding what about their present circumstances is and isnt like a James Bond picture. At the same time Vaughn hits most of the familiar stations of a Bond movie including the introduction of gadgets in the first hour that get used in the second. Vaughn co-wrote and directed ""Kick-Ass"" and perhaps the looseness and outrageousness of that earlier film -- the way it satisfied genre conventions even while tweaking and satirizing them -- is what Vaughn was trying to do here. But this is the first time that Vaughn (""Layer Cake"" ""Stardust"") has lost control of his story. Long before it ends the movie has already started to feel like a long stunt a genre parody for the sake of itself with no larger comment or insight to offer. Samuel Jackson shows up as a criminal mastermind a technology mogul who schemes to kill a billion people but is too delicate to witness the violence he creates. Jackson plays him with an exaggerated lisp that goes in and out in a performance thats too silly for the movies more serious sections involving murder. Though at first Harry and the new recruits burgeoning father-son relationship seems to be at the core of the films purpose there really is nothing in ""Kingsman"" to ground it in anything like real emotion. It tries to hold us through scale and outlandishness and yet every time the script springs a surprise on us its always for the worse with things happening that either wouldnt or really shouldnt. But heres the real irony. The attempt may have been to do a postmodern ironic 21st century spin on Bond. Yet if we were to say what ""Kingsman"" most resembles it would be the old TV show ""Get Smart"" which was conceived as a Bond satire in the mid-1960s. As with ""Get Smart"" the mix of comedy and corpses in ""Kingsman"" becomes callous and clueless -- in addition to seeming about 50 years behind the times. In the end the most interesting thing about ""Kingsman"" might be that its the second movie to come out in a week -- the other was ""Jupiter Ascending"" -- to identify computer technology and the technological ruling class as the ultimate threats to peace and happiness. Sometimes movies contain truths that their filmmakers are unaware of just like dreams often mean more than dreamers realize. This may be a trend worth watching.

Jackson star in a trailer for the spy movie ""Kingsman The Secret Service."" If you go into Matthew Vaughns film expecting a posh British spy thriller (Colin Firth Michael Caine) youll be surprised. But not in a bad way.""Kingsman The Secret Service"" stars (from left) Taron Egerton Colin Firth and Samuel L. Jackson.(Photo Jaap Buitendijk/20th Century Fox)Story Highlights4 stars (out of 5)Colin Firth proves surprisingly adept at action sequences.Taron Egerton in his first major role balances the tough and the soft in winning fashion.Director Matthew Vaughns only shortcoming is that he doesnt know when its all too much.Those who file into theaters to see ""Kingsman The Secret Service"" -- and by all means you should -- are in for a surprise if not an outright shock.With a cast that includes Colin Firth and Michael Caine and concerns James Bond-inspired intrigue and action you think ah a posh British action comedy. Characters speaking the Queens English (or ""The Kings Speech"") the occasional comic-action set piece all that eh what? Smashing.Nope.The thing to remember about ""Kingsman"" is that its directed by Matthew Vaughn who also directed ""Kick-Ass."" He got a lot of mileage out of that graphic-novel adaptation (as is this) by shocking us with for instance an adorable young girl slicing up bad guys and cursing like a stevedore while doing so. It was anachronistic and bizarre and really entertaining if you were willing to give yourself to it. (The sequel not so much.)Related Director Matthew Vaughn loves loves loves spy moviesThat same dichotomy of expectation means itll take you awhile to reset what you thought you were in for but you wont have long to do so A man is sliced right down the middle five minutes into it. (This is not a spoiler. So many appendages and heads and whatever else are separated from their bodies that you quickly lose count.)The trick of course is in the numbers. Kill one person in a film and youve personalized the experience. It means something. It affects you. Explode heads by the dozens if not hundreds in a rainbow-colored shower of fireworks and classical music and you enter the realm of the absurd which is where Vaughn works best.Firth plays Harry Hart whose code name is Galahad. Hes a member of a super-secret group of elite spies who operate out of a swank Saville Row menswear shop. They operate beyond the purview of any government and the attendant red tape instead taking their cues from the Knights of the Roundtable (thus the code names). Theyre gentlemen you see but lethal in the extreme when foiling the bad guys.The film begins with a botched mission that costs one of the knights his life. Seventeen years later his son Eggsy (Taron Egerton) is just a step above a street kid who gets into trouble calls the number on the back of a coin Galahad gave him when his father died and the next thing you know Eggsy is competing against others for a spot among the secret service. As hes enduring training and competition insane billionaire Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson lisping for all hes worth) is plotting a far-fetched culling of the population that involves deadly violence (obviously) but whose most ridiculous element is Valentines offer of free cellphone and Internet service to the world.Well believe most anything but really come on.Theres a scene in which Valentine invites Galahad to dinner and they engage in an I-know-you-know-and-you-know-I-know conversation that revolves around their shared love of early James Bond movies (before they got so serious). The movie based on the graphic novel by Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons is filled with such winks and nods some played for laughs one in particular not.Eggsys a tough nut different from the better-educated (but less intelligent) candidates for the single opening. Merlin (Mark Strong) devises all sorts of impossible-seeming tasks for the bunch but Arthur (Caine) doesnt have much hope for Eggsy even with the boys pedigree.Things go from far-fetched to insane before its over and Vaughn wisely keeps the pace at a healthy clip. But never underestimate his power to floor you. A scene set inside a church goes far beyond prayer into something that feels like too much -- the only real complaint about the movie. Vaughn never knows when to pull back and if that approach works most of the time it doesnt always. That said the operatic staging of the violence is amazing.Firth is outstanding as a Bond-like spy surprisingly able to dispatch bad guys. Who knew? And Egerton gets the balance of tough-on-the-outside soft-on-the-inside just right. Hey some of us like those later serious ""Bond"" movies. But it doesnt mean we cant enjoy a face-smacking goof like ""Kingsman"" too.Kingsman The Secret Service4 stars (out of 5) Director Matthew Vaughn.Cast Colin Firth Taron Egerton Samuel L.

(AP Photo/20th Century Fox Jaap Buitendijk) If you didnt know that ""Kingsman The Secret Service"" was directed by Matthew Vaughn (""X-Men First Class"") you might think it was the work of a confused and borderline sociopathic young man who was weaned on movies instead of milk. As a spoof of spy flicks it openly declares war on the seriousness that has crept into the genre since the heyday of James Bond.Such spoofery dates back to the 60s when movies such as ""Our Man Flint"" and ""The Silencers"" were harmless apolitical fun. But ""Kingsman"" is ultra-violent as if an ""Austin Powers"" movie had been directed by a Tarantino wannabe. And its underlying politics are fascist with villains who include Christians a climate-change scientist a handicapped assassin and several democratically elected heads of state.Yet because Vaughns name is attached were forced to give it the benefit of the doubt. With the politically incorrect ""Layer Cake"" and ""Kick-Ass"" Vaughn leapfrogged his friend Guy Ritchie (""Snatch"") as the pre-eminent action director in the U.K. So maybe theres a method to the madness. But good luck trying to find it. In this adaptation of a comic-book series the Kingsmen are private intelligence operatives who work incognito out of a London tailors shop. They have pseudonyms that link them to the Knights of the Round Table. Harry Hart aka Galahad (Colin Firth) is their top gun. For 17 years he has kept a watchful eye on a scruffy working-class lad called Eggsy (Taron Egerton) whose late father saved Harrys life. At a pivotal moment in Eggsys life Harry invites him to join the league of deadly gentlemen.As in so many movies targeting the 18-30 demographic theres a trial by fire. Eggsy must outsmart and outfight a handful of snooty recruits who are subjected to potentially fatal tests by Merlin (Mark Strong). Meanwhile American tech billionaire and climate-change zealot Romeo Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson with a terrible distracting lisp) is plotting to save the planet by trimming the excess human population. When dapper Harry and downtown Eggsy unleash their tech toys and martial-arts maneuvers against Valentine (who employs an assassin babe with razor prosthetics instead of feet) all hell breaks loose. A bloody melee in a Southern Baptist church might be the most distastefully violent scene of the new century. Then theres a finale in which the worlds most powerful leaders (including Barack Obama) get a colorful comeuppance for siding with the scientist. (Its actually quite a lovely flowering of pyrotechnics until you think about what is happening --something this flashy movie rarely encourages us to do.) To top this loathsome layer cake a punchline ending involves debauching a beautiful princess.""Kingsman"" is like a high-speed collision between a Jaguar and a jaywalking soccer hooligan. Its ridiculously out of balance and when youre stuck in the middle it doesnt seem so funny.What ""Kingsman The Secret Service""  One and a half stars out of four  Rating R  Run time 207  Content Extreme bloody violence strong language and a scene of sexuality/nudity Joe Williams  314-340-8344Film criticjoethecritic on Twitterjoewilliamspost-dispatch.com Tags Colin Firth Kingsman James Bond Joe Williams Matthew Vaughn Joe Williams Joe Williams is the film critic for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Feeling a bit weary of watching Samuel L. Jackson in hero mode through countless Marvel adventures? Jaded by Michael Caine acting grandfatherly in any Christopher Nolan movie you can name? Tired of Colin Firth hitherto known as a proper fastidious Englishman in every film hes made? Sick of Mark Hamill in ""Star Wars""? Then check out ""Kingsman The Secret Service"" a stylized superspy caper stretching a selection of high-profile actors to roles satirically against type. Seeing the dapper Firth bayonet a bigoted Southern preacher on a stake or cleave a redneck lady congregants skull with a hatchet is such a refreshing change of pace. ""Kingsman"" is a tongue-in-cheek love letter to the days before James Bond Jason Bourne and Jack Bauer decided that espionage is gritty grounded serious stuff. Directed by Matthew Vaughn creator of such pedal-to-the-metal classics as ""Kick-Ass"" and ""X-Men First Class"" its compulsively watchable escapism from the get-go. Its partly a salute to the old -- think Roger Moores Bond suave but silly -- and to the new in its cartoonishly violent high-five to politically incorrect neoconservatism. When is the last time a big-budget film made a visual joke out of a world-famous left-leaning real-life leaders head exploding like a grenade-filled pumpkin? The Kingsman organization is run by posh British gentlemen operating from a ""Downton Abbey""-style castle free of government control. Funded by the kingdoms wealthiest blue bloods for generations they imitate the Round Table of Arthurian legend with matching code names Arthur the leader (Caine) Galahad (Firth) and many more. Their code of chivalry is to untie knotty international problems with an armory of bulletproof umbrellas poisoned pens exploding lighters and dagger-tipped Oxford lace-ups designed at their elegant Savile Row haberdashery. Dressing in impeccable double-breasted suits is their way of aweing opponents. As Firth tells the groups newest recruit ""The suit is a modern gentlemans armor. And the Kingsman agents are the new knights."" But can even a bespoke suit fit a lower-class lad with a history of youthful larceny? Eggsy (Taron Egerton) grew up stealing cars and skipping school after his fathers Mideast ambush in a Kingsman battle that opens the film. Galahad hopes to train him X-Men Academy style against half a dozen upper-class rivals for a spot at the Round Table. This setup is a gift for Vaughn whose films make hallmark sequences of kids joining superhero squads. kingsman the secret service 1/2 out of 4 stars Rating R for sequences of strong violence language and some sexual content. But the movie reaches its best action beats surprisingly when the 54-year-old Firth sighs stands up and pushes his way through lengthy single-camera sequences of ultraviolence. Its a grand new direction for the urbane actor but he pulls it off. Each scene is choreographed to painstaking perfection. His nemesis a lisping cellphone billionaire named Valentine (Jackson) is a cousin of Austin Powers Dr. Evil. The mogul is allergic to the sight of blood but willing to shed oceans of it to halt global warming and the population explosion. Valentines bodyguard taps another Vaughn delight uber-violent female supporting characters. Gazelle (played by lovely Algerian dancer Sofia Boutella) is one of the most remarkable supporting villains since ""Goldfingers"" Oddjob. Performing balletic karate on steel prosthetic legs she resembles the worlds most beautiful meat cleaver. Vaughn is a gifted director where visual style is concerned but occasionally off-target with matters of character and timing. The lower-class dole-sucking East Enders surrounding Eggsy are Brit-flick cliches all baseball caps imitation sportswear track suits and illiterate antisocial jive. Even Eggsys dear mum turns into a feral cleaver-swinging beast now and again one of several females in the story who get the shaft metaphorically or literally. And the films second-act momentum slows and sputters for a while before shifting into top gear for the finale where Egerton finally steps into the lead. The film isnt 100 percent perfect but its classic 007 and then some. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

It even references Bond outright in a post-modern way.Mashing up satire subtle social commentary clever gadgetry keen wit and high-octane style this spy saga -- based on the comic book series The Secret Service -- is bolstered by a terrific cast.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Colin Firth Taron Egerton and Samuel L. Jackson star in a trailer for the spy movie ""Kingsman The Secret Service."" Twentieth Century FoxDirector Matthew Vaughnknows how to stage an action scene particularly martial arts madness and leaven it with cheeky humor. Hes also skilled at adapting comic books having helmed2010s Kick-Assand 2011s X Men First Class.A ""Kingsman is a dapper member of an elite and super-secretive international spy organization where the members model themselves after the Knights of the Round Table. The group is led by Arthur (Michael Caine) who must oversee the recruitment of a new member to replace a fallen operative.Arthur entrusts major responsibility to Galahad/Harry Hart (Colin Firth) a suave and unflappable gent if ever there was one. Harry can wield a sensible black umbrella like nobodys business. The operatives fight crime in unusual ways and use an upscale tailors shop on Savile Row as the front for their elaborate operations.The sophisticated Harry recruits an unlikely teen candidate Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin (Taron Egerton) the rough-around-the edges son of a former Kingsman and troubled Michelle (Samantha Womack). Hes also a frequent punching bag for abusive stepdad Dean (Geoff Bell).Though Eggsy seems on his way to becoming a thug Harry sees something in the lad. Soon Eggsy is facing stiff competition with a half-dozen other wannabe Kingsman operatives under the strict instruction of Merlin (Mark Strong).Firth is spot-on as Harry. His crisp delivery and ease with a droll retort is ideal for the part. As he tells Eggsy ""We are first and foremost gentleman spies.""Its also a singular treat to watch Firth ordinarily the picture of refinement play a bad-ass in a perfectly tailored suit and horn-rimmed glasses.Eggsys path is as bizarre and amusing as the contests he faces to test his mettle.A global villain looms in the form of a twisted technical whiz Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) the head of a cellphone empire who makes a splash along with his blade-legged henchwoman Gazelle (Sofia Boutella). Jackson is hilarious as a lisping bad guy bent on world domination but who hates the sight of blood.The film opens with a bang. One of the early scenes involves a kidnapped Professor Arnold (Mark Hamill) being held captive at a remote lodge in the Argentine Andes. It sets the tone for the stylized twists and dark humor to come.One scene stands out awkwardly however involving Harry going on a drawn-out murderous rampage in a church. Its excessively grisly and could have been jettisoned.Through most of the story though director Vaughn nimbly balances cartoonish fantasy with just enough character development.The blithe spirit of the tale has a few weaknesses and incomprehensible spots Why does the conclusion involve a silly sexist scene? Its as if the filmmakers didnt quite know how to wrap things up. The film is also about 15 minutes too long for an action comedy.Still Kingsman is giddy fun sometimes thrilling often absurdly amusing and consistently well-tailored. 236 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 7 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1Dm0STr",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/02/12/kingsman-review/23262639/,200,kingsmanthesecretservice26,kingsmanthesecretservice,usatoday

"Kingsman The Secret Service review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review Kingsman The Secret Service Kingsman The Secret Service Twentieth Century Fox Colin Firth in ""Kingsman The Secret Service."" Colin Firth in ""Kingsman The Secret Service."" (Twentieth Century Fox) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune The film posing the question Wait did Obamas head just explode on-screen? Silly sadistic and finally a little galling ""Kingsman The Secret Service"" answers the question What would Colin Firth have been like if hed played James Bond?With faint traces of boredom in his eyes Firth portrays one of the crack gentlemen-spies working for a supersecret and extraordinarily well-funded agency out to save the world from a crackpot billionaire philanthropist (Samuel L. Jackson with a wee lisp and a plan to destroy the human species). As Firths beautifully tailored colleagues Michael Caine and Mark Strong offer unblinking gazes par excellence. And in the leading role Welsh newcomer Taron Egerton is engaging as the working-class miscreant ""Eggsy"" recruited by Firths Harry Hart to join the Kingsman cadre. Its a family thing; Eggsys father was a Kingsman now deceased. And theres your plot summary.If you dont like the way the actions handled in an action movie you are in trouble and thats where I was with ""Kingsman"" from the moment a metal-footed henchwoman (Sofia Boutella) scissor-kicked through the air and sliced an adversary in half. Those pulled into the theater based on vague marketing promises of a classy espionage lark starring familiar English faces may wonder what hit them. Based on the 2012 graphic novel ""The Secret Service"" by Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons director Matthew Vaughns picture will appeal to anyone who enjoyed Vaughns earlier ""Kick-Ass."" I didnt. I find the jocularity of Vaughns gamer-style violence a drag. The sudden slo-mo; the flurry of anonymous kills painlessly brutal but cumulatively numbing After an hour I wanted some visual clarity and something more than a few jokes about the tropes of the spy movie genre. At one point Firth and Jackson talk about their love of the old Bond pictures and the necessity of a strong villain. Its good for a laugh but its a dead-end laugh; when its over youre stuck with ""Kingsman"" again. Latest movies reviewedOpen link Vaughns visual approach is to approximate the outlandish physicality of whats possible within a graphic novel fantasy on paper. I will say this ""Kingsman"" has some nerve however misguided. It kills off a major character and as part of the young hot recruits deadly audition for the agency theyre asked to kill the puppies (kill the puppies) theyve been charged with overseeing for months.Theres a scene set in ""KENTUCKY U.S.A."" as the helpful title card informs us in which a brainwashed Firth murders a hundred or so white supremacists at a church. And get this Theres a fleeting shot of President Barack Obamas head exploding (seen from the rear) along with various other politicians and celebrities heads after the psycho-billionaires plan gets underway.Lets take that as a shoutout to the exploding-head bit in ""The Interview"" that caused so much fuss lately. If Kim Jong Un is still miffed about that movie perhaps hell take solace in ""Kingsman."" As different as they are both movies offer roughly the same entertainment value. Which is to say some. Not enough.

Share Tweet Kingsman The Secret Service is a live-action Hammacher Schlemmer catalog of pseudo-retro novelties spiced up with self-aware asides and over-the-top violence--slick entertainment provided the viewer turns off whatever part of their brain is responsible for recognizing and parsing subtext. Very loosely adapted from a Mark Millar comic by Jane Goodman and director Matthew Vaughn--who were also responsible for the Millar adaptation Kick-Ass--Kingsman centers on an ""independent spy agency"" which is headquartered in Londons Savile Row and outfits its agents with bulletproof umbrellas perfectly tailored suits and hi-tech Harry Palmer glasses. Its an exaggerated pastiche of Cold War-era spy shows and James Bond films with characters continually bringing up Bond and martinis in the dialogue just in case the audience doesnt catch on. Self-awareness can be subversive but not if its the only end goal. Far from being a Team America-style send-up of gentleman spy movies Kingsman is actually even more reactionary than the movies its referencing; it traffics in the kind of Tory values Bond flicks merely suggest building to a finale that can only be described as an ideological can of worms that cant be opened without spoiling the movies third act and whatever fun a viewer might have watching it play out. (Lets just say that Barack Obama is in cahoots with the bad guys and Ronald Reagan helps save the day.) And the thing is the movie is fun at least from a visual design standpoint even though its hard to separate its bespoke fashions future-vintage gadgets and aristocratic decor from its fusty worldview. As in X-Men First Class Vaughn shows a real knack for integrating flashy production design and complex effects sequences most notably during a couple of super-violent bone-cracking head-impaling hand-to-hand fight scenes. Colin Firth stars as Harry Hart a veteran Kingsman agent tasked with finding a new recruit after one of his colleagues ends up dead--sliced neatly down the middle by a henchwoman (dancer Sofia Boutella) with razor-sharp prosthetic legs--while trying to rescue kooky climate scientist Professor Arnold (Mark Hamill). Harrys pick is working-class public-housing-bred delinquent Eggsy (Taron Egerton)--much to the apparent dismay of the head of the agency (Michael Caine naturally) who is codenamed ""Arthur."" (Harry is codenamed ""Galahad"" while the agencys Q stand-in--played by Mark Strong--is known only as ""Merlin."") Sent off to the Kingsman mansion via a giant pneumatic tube Eggsy finds himself as one of dozen candidates competing for a chance to become the agencys new ""Lancelot"" learning marksmanship and survival skills alongside lessons in manners and style. Kingsmans central conflict can best be described as ""snobs vs. gentlemen."" The former category includes most of Eggsys fellow Kingsman candidates and megalomaniac dot-com billionaire Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jacskon dressed like Spike Lee and speaking with a lisp) who has a convoluted plan to save the planet by killing off most of its population. The latter is embodied by Harry Kingsman candidate Roxy (Sophie Cookson) and eventually Eggsy. That sounds palatable but its soured by the movies vision of the working class as composed entirely of promiscuous women and the lowlifes who beat them and by Harrys definition of a gentleman as someone who looks down on his past self whereas snobs look down on others. Anyone can be a gentleman regardless of gender or socioeconomic background provided they adopt the look and bearing of the idealized mid-century British upper class. Gentlemen not elected governments are the only ones fit to run the world. (Readers wondering whether this is a case of a critic reading too deep into an often funny spy pastiche should know that this idea is explicitly expressed in the movie several times over and is the motivating ideology of the Kingsman agency which has no government ties and is funded by old money.)This is a long way of saying that Kingsman is ideologically vapid--unless of course a viewer believes that the world is better off being run by shadowy Napoleonic brandy-sipping patricians and that socially or economically disadvantaged groups will wallow in filth if left to their own devices and can only achieve anything by imitating their betters. (This worldview is also known as snobbery. Go figure.) Vaughn--who produced Guy Ritchies early work and shares Ritchies taste for visual flashiness--cant make these political points seem any less stupid nor is he trying to; theyre the animating force behind the whole movie. What he does do however is mine them for jokes and gory kicks whether its the aforementioned blade-footed henchwoman carefully unwrapping a tray of Big Macs in the background of a tense conversation between Harry and Richmond Valentine or the movies climax in which bodies explode like fireworks. How much a prospective viewer might end up enjoying Kingsman probably depends on how much theyre willing to ignore in the interest of being entertained or whether they prefer the kind of entertainment that doesnt require a mental off switch.For thoughts on and a place to discuss the plot details not talked about in this review visit Kingsmans spoiler space.

But hey thats just me. Caught between straight-up James Bond and the Austin Powers parody version Kingsman is a high-octane combo of  action and comedy that breathes sweet and surreal new life into the big-screen spy game where Bond meets Jason Bourne and Jack Bauer. Adapted from Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons 2012 comic book series and directed by Matthew Vaughn with the same anything-goes ingenuity he brought to Kick Ass Kingsman is all over the place sometimes to its detriment. But you wont want to miss the surprises it delights in springing. More News 10 Best Movies of 2014 Sundance 2015 Stars Answer Peter Travers Burning Question Watch Peter Travers Gag Over Januarys Worst Films All Stories >> Related 2015 Preview 68 Reasons This Year Will Rule The smash albums blockbuster movies and water-cooler TV shows to watch out for over the next 12 months In a role that fits him like a bespoke suit Firth is everything you want in an international man of mystery. His suave British agent Harry Hart code-named Galahad plays by the rules of a company headed by Arthur (a kingly Michael Caine) that names its agents after knights of the round table.  Since Lancelot (Jack Davenport) died saving Galahads ass 17 years ago Galahad resolves to return the favor by recruiting Lances now grown son Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin (Taron Egerton) into the secret service. The thing is Eggsy is a lout a street kid who seems destined for prison instead of the elegant environs of Kingsman a swank tailoring shop on Saville Row that fronts for the Secret Service. Got that? Now add the posh young recruits that Eggsy must vie with to achieve a place at the table. My advice? Just jump into the action and go with it. Thats what Vaughn does. The opening scene a flashback introduces Richmond Valentine a big-bucks super-villain played to the hilt and beyond by  a lisping Samuel L. Jackson with a cruel streak Goldfinger would envy. Valentine has a gal Friday named Gazelle (Algerian dancer Sofia Boutella) whose prosthetic legs are tipped with blades Kleb would envy. Too much of an in-joke? The movie is loaded with them including a cameo from an unrecognizable Mark Hamill and a dissertation on Bond villains from Firth and Jackson. Newbie Egerton holds his own with a cast of pros and I loved his twist on an 007 martini -- ""gin poured while glancing at an unopened bottle of vermouth."" I could go on. The movie sure as hell does with Vaughn and co-writer Jane Goldman throwing grenades into the plot every chance they get. The big set piece and its a wowzer involves a church massacre provoked by lethal SIM cards that Valentine installs in cell phones. Even when it stops making sense Kingsman is unstoppable fun.

(Jaap Buitendijk/Twentieth Century Fox) Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday February 11 2015 433 PM Title ""Kingsman The Secret Service"" Film Info With Colin Firth Taron Egerton Samuel L. Jackson. Spy satire pits old-fashioned mores against newfangled action. Director Matthew Vaughn (209). R Graphic violence language sexuality. Area theaters. Half amusing and half appalling Matthew Vaughns shameless spy caper ""Kingsman The Secret Service"" is ultimately done in by its own hypocrisy. But its an entertaining ride for a while especially with a droll and dapper Colin Firth leading the charge. Firth plays Harry Hart an agent in the Kingsmen an ultra-elite British espionage organization. When the group finds itself a spy short Harry asks Eggsy (Taron Egerton) a young rough-edged grifter to try for the job. Eggsy doesnt fit in with the other potential recruits. Theyre mostly entitled prep-school grads. But his rebellious attitude is more valuable than their posh snobbery once they come up against nutty tech zillionaire Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson). The eco-minded Valentine and his murderous henchwoman Gazelle (Sofia Boutella) have hit upon an ... unusual version of population control. We wont spoil the details but its fair to say their plan to save the Earth involves sacrificing many of its citizens. At this point the mayhem moves from bold to bloody to brutal with an unfortunate slide into pandering. Its easy to see why Vaughn (""Kick-Ass"") would want to adapt ""The Secret Service"" the graphic novel on which the film is based. He has a great eye for comic book unconventionality and keen instincts for marrying sly observations with brazenly blunt action. He aims to both undercut and update spy cliches and his cast (including Michael Caine Mark Hamill and Mark Strong) is absolutely in on the joke. There are lots of clever moments especially when Harry introduces Eggsy to the Bond-level perks of their craft -- hidden weapons secret lairs perfect cocktails. But things get pushed too far and the movies cruelest scenes make clear that no one set any limits here. The political statements which veer between liberal and conservative depending on convenience are aggressively delivered but muddled and amoral. The violence flies repellently over the top and the finale features an extended joke so insanely sexist it sends us out on a seriously sour note. Thats a shame because theres a lot of fun to be had in the first half especially for anyone looking for a high-octane alternative to ""Fifty Shades of Grey."" Vaughn may have set out to satirize the retrograde values of the Kingsmen but he never settles on a satisfying alternative himself.

Photo Jaap Buitendijk MOVIE REVIEW Kingsman The Secret Service Running time 129 minutes. Rated R (graphic violence profanity sexual content). ""Kingsman The Secret Service"" borrows the tone story characters and humor of ""Kick-Ass"" only this time in a 007 world instead of Batmans. Nearly everything it does it does poorly This one is ""Weak-Ass."" This time the boy and girl transformed into the bane of supervillains by a father figure are Brits Eggsy (Taron Egerton) and Roxy (Sophie Cookson) whose James Bond-style mentor (Colin Firth) is a member of a secret order of contemporary spy-knights the Kingsman led by a sort of King Arthur (Michael Caine). Directed (like ""Kick-Ass"") by Matthew Vaughn ""Kingsman"" is a mad clutter of ""Austin Powers""-style parody campy comedy and gory action. Its like a salad composed of lettuce tomatoes butterscotch pudding raw liver and motor oil. As the baddie who plots to destroy the world to the tune of a KC and the Sunshine Band song Samuel L. Jackson does a bizarre lisp and seems to be in an entirely different movie from Firth who plays it more or less straight as a debonair James Bond. The movie is so desperate to be irreverent that a captive princess says to the hero ""If you save the world we can do it in the a - - hole."" Isnt it romantic? ""Austin Powers"" knew the way to do a Bond spoof was full-on comedy not with screeching tonal shifts from scene to scene. Sequences in which the tryouts for the Kingsman wake up to find their barracks flooding over their heads or are tossed out of an airplane and learn that one of them has no parachute are excitingly filmed but theres so much goofing off surrounding these bits that the characters seem disposable. Jacksons villain meanwhile is not only not interesting hes just plain ridiculous neither threatening nor funny. ""Kingsman"" thinks its clever to have characters discuss what kind of movie theyre in and whether the psychopath should come up with a convoluted method to kill the hero. That kind of meta-joke went stale years ago though This martini is neither shaken nor stirred. Its spilled all over the place leaving you with a mess instead of a buzz.

"Review Kingsman a sharp entertaining sendup of 007 - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Kingsman a sharp entertaining sendup of 007By Randy MyersSan Jose Mercury News CorrespondentPosted 02/11/2015 114833 AM PSTUpdated 02/11/2015 043153 PM PSTWhen done right parodies look easy. In reality theyre high-wire acts that demand the limber creative skills of filmmakers who can balance the crazy alongside the clever. Mel Brooks is a master of the form. His ""Young Frankenstein"" charmingly skewered old-school horror tropes while ""High Anxiety"" affectionately lampooned Hitchcock. Both films were quotable hilarious and exuberantly over-the-top.Unfortunately successes like these arent the norm in a grab bag genre stuffed with too many rotten apples.Now smack in the middle of a film calendar with blunders like ""Jupiter Ascending"" and ""The Boy Next Door"" comes some relief with ""Kingsman The Secret Service.""Starring a very on-top-of-his-game Colin Firth and directed with wild wit and confident edginess by Matthew Vaughn (""Kick-Ass"") this go-for-broke homage to 007 and his superspy brethren is refreshing and well violently kick-ass. Based on the comic book series cooked up by Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons ""Kingsman"" isnt always steady on its feet but once it defines its characters and pours out the storys foundation it kicks into overdrive.Harry Hart is a dapper superspy with a license to kill in a British secret intelligence society overseen by Arthur (Michael Caine). Each member of this group receives the namesake of a King Arthurs Round Table seatmate.Advertisement Frothily yet smoothly played by Oscar-winner Firth Hart is a smartly dressed dandy who keeps tabs on the family of a colleague killed on a long-ago mission. When the son of that fallen Kingsman gets into police trouble 17 years later (one of the films clunkiest roll-your-eyes sequences) Harry arrives to honor his colleagues memory and lead the boy with a gymnast background toward the clandestine organization. Harrys Kingsman teammate Merlin (Mark Strong) puts Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin (newcomer Taron Egerton) through boot camp training along with others vying for a position once held by Lancelot. That vacancy came about when Lancelot was slain while trying to rescue a climate-change scientist (Mark Hamill of ""Star Wars"" fame) from the clutches of a wacko billionaire philanthropist Valentine (played by Samuel L. Jackson delivering a comic ace of a performance). Valentine partners with a paraplegic hit woman named Gazelle (Sofia Boutella) a beauty who wields lethal blades to take out adversaries. Valentine is a piece of work a baseball-capped guy who hates the sight of blood and develops a cuckoo plot that benefits celebrities leaders and the well-heeled.This setup gives the film a subversive kick in the pants and opens a window of opportunity for Vaughn and his frequent co-writer collaborator Jane Goldman to jump through. While the script pays jocular homage to the spy genre with a martini-laced toast to such icons as 007 Jason Bourne Jack Bauer and all their gadgetry its not just accessorizing. Social commentary zingers take aim at our celebrity-obsessed culture renegade billionaires and the hazards of extremism on the right and the left.It all clicks with Vaughns style -- best described as out-of-control yet operatic violence (the finale and a scene in a church explode in so many ways) coupled with brazen observations. Vaughn and Millar form a good union having partnered before in bringing Millars ""Kick-Ass"" comics to the screen. In directing five films Vaughn who helmed ""X-Men First Class"" has carved out quite a reputation as an exciting pop-art filmmaker frequently compared to Quentin Tarantino. In its carefully choreographed and precisely edited violent set pieces ""Kingsman"" reminded me of ""Kill Bill.""But Vaughn is unique. And its his vision moxie and attention to detail along with the trifecta of invigorating performances from Firth Jackson and Egerton that make ""Kingsman"" not just another pawn in the parody department. If youre not averse to ridiculous violence and un-PC irreverence your money will be well spent.

Expensive derivative and boring as mattress ticking masquerading as designer fabric Kingsman The Secret Service is a James Bond parody with a teenage 007 based on a series of British comic books that in my opinion should never have crossed the pond. The Kingsman is a secret freelance spy organization operating out of an exclusive Savile Row haberdashery shop and composed of debonair heroes in double-breasted fashions who take the names of the Knights of the Round Table. You wont go away humming anything from Camelot. KINGSMAN THE SECRET SERVICE  (1/4 stars) Written by Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman Directed by Matthew Vaughn Starring Colin Firth Taron Egerton and Samuel L. Jackson Running time 129 min. The head of the independent agents is Colin Firth looking splendid as the elegant tailor Harry Hart (nicknamed Galahad) with his tongue firmly checked in his lockjaw as he tries not to frown in disgust at the routine violence or dopey dialogue. His job is to find and recruit a new Lancelot to insure fresh young blood into the groups future as saviors of the realm which by the way seems to be totally unaware of their existence. (No M to link them to the government.) The chap they discover is a junior G-Man (newcomer Taron Egerton) they call Eggy a gymnast who left the Marines to take care of his ailing mum. A great deal of time is wasted introducing the strenuous tests a wannabe espionage agent must pass before he can really go out and blow up London or kill interminable lists of innocent bystanders. Eggy must not only endure inhuman challenges like being pushed out of an airplane without a parachute but the cliches of British class snobbery. The villain is a homicidal maniac with a speech impediment played by Samuel L. Jackson who lisps his way through corny lines with an excess of Ss (""Call the Chineth Thecret Thervith"") in a performance that is more annoying than amusing. It is never clear what hes up to or why--something about destroying the world with signet rings that deliver 10000 volts of electricity mobile phone cards that drive adversaries into violent rages and shoes with knives in the toes like Lotte Lenya in From Russia With Love. Lenya did it better. I am told there is one scene in overwhelming bad taste in which President Obamas head is blown off like the exploding heads in the disastrous universally panned The Interview. I cannot swear to that face personally because it happened while I was dozing off from tedium missing it completely. Michael Caine drops in without excuse from time to time. Vomiting at the sight of blood and serving Big Macs at a bountiful dinner party Mr. Jackson is just silly. But the real sadness is watching Mr. Firth lower his standards. After so many astonishing performances in films of great merit its dismaying to see him in drivel like this.

Whats beyond argument however is that Vaughn has whipped up the most interesting one the only to make ferocious unsettling art out of the great contradiction of superheroic fantasy jolly do-goodism and its brutalizing sadism. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Vaughns violence here is more florid ingenious and giddily amoral than the provocations of Kick-Ass his 2010 adaption of a comic co-created by Mark Millar the troublemaking Scottish co-author with artist Dave Gibbons of the Kingsman comic series. Kingsmans opening plays like British Sniper meets The Lego Movie A pair of Taliban in the Afghan desert suffer rah-rah head shots and then Western helicopters strafe their ancient palace the rubble exploding out and morphing into the movies opening credits. Liberals who feel queasy about all that Arab-murdering should know that Vaughn bookends that mission with a climax targeting the worst of the West the billionaires who might opt in to the just-the-swells new society of Atlas Shruggeds Galts Gulch -- I wont spoil it except to say the scene is wicked and rapturous.Everything in Kingsman is familiar cribbed from James Bond and a thousand other sources yet every setup gets twisted twice and then once more just when you think youre ahead of it. Vaughns mode is parodic but he stages the killings with joyous vigor -- with one key exception hes gunning for applause even as what hes showing us would have been read by previous generations as horror. He invests the nastiest elements of kill-em-all entertainments with rare invention going so far over the top that you might worry as the movie swells up bigger and bigger with its madness that at some point it must collapse crashing back into formula the way most Bond and comic-book movies do. But somehow he keeps the craziness coming through three or four escalating climaxes. Even the most stale of adventure-tale cliches gets blown up to absurdity Our leads reward for his heroics isnt just the usual good-hearted beauty -- its a princess who quite literally promises him her asshole.Film DetailsCritics Pick Kingsman The Secret Service RatingR GenreAction/Adventure Running Time129 More Info Trailer Is that a critique of womens roles in mens adventures? Or just a horny-porny updating? As in Kick-Ass Vaughn and Millar leave you to make sense of their mess although this time there are some encouraging clues. Kingsman focuses on a fusty British secret service comprising handsomely suited gents who call themselves ""tailors"" and take pride in not having their heroics make the papers. After a Kingsman dies in the field spectacularly the organization -- headed of course by Michael Caine -- must bring in new blood a batch of promising teenagers who must survive deadly spy-game training. If you wonder why Kingsmans potential recruits are all white or why the movie blasts its lone heroic female character out to space for the last couple reels Vaughn and the studio have a wise-ass defense Blame the British aristocracyColin Firth plays the most enlightened of the Kingsmen an elegant fellow who can bust up a pub full of yobs with just his umbrella. (Vaughns fantastic beat-every-bastard-in-the-room scenes have a crowd-pleasing clarity and logic too often missing in this kind of thing -- compare them to the ""Wait what just happened?"" dust-ups in The Equalizer.) Firths agent being a decent chap takes on young Eggsy (Taron Egerton) as a candidate for the agency despite Eggsys glaring unsuitability The fireplug tough is after all a tenement kid aspiring to the poshest of stations. Eggsy gets sneered at by the upper crust all through training of course but wouldnt you know it His street savvy eventually puts him ahead. In Kingsman as in actual comic books where everythings going isnt ever in doubt -- but just what might happen the next moment always is.While Eggsy grits his way through an inspired Enders Game/X-Men First Class learning-curve plot Firths agent swans through a delicious 007 pastiche one that finds him and Samuel L. Jackson as the tech-titan villain openly discussing everything dumb and great about Bond movies -- and how much more fun those films used to be. That cutesy stuff is funny though and Jackson -- lisping and excitable as a Silicon Valley naif who proclaims ""Now that is a dope-ass top hat"" -- is the most hilarious Bond villain since the one Albert Brooks played on that old Simpsons. Sofia Boutella an Algerian dancer plays Jacksons lethal Oddjob stealing and slicing to ribbons every scene shes in.Heres a warning though. This might all sound like the usual action-comedy laugh just with some R-rated language and squib packs. But Vaughn and Millar live to rub our faces in the kind of entertainment we seem to want. So deep into the film one of those kill-every-bad-guy-in-the-room sequences becomes something much more harrowing an unstintingly nasty kill-every-person-in-the-room scene that grinds on and on capping with a gruesome impalement. The preview audience I saw this with cheered much of the film but this stunned them -- the fascistic dehumanizing subtext of our million-dollar entertainments laid bare right in the midst of one. But Vaughns no polemicist and he persuades viewers to swallow back their revulsion just a couple scenes later. The next deaths he gets us to whoop to. Samuel L. Jacksons great here but Vaughn wittily exposes us as the real villains.1 Photo by Jaap Buitendijk Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Alan Scherstuhl Follow studiesincrap Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

By Anthony Lane Colin Firth plays a British agent in a movie directed by Matthew Vaughn. The template is early-to-mid James Bond.   Credit Illustration by Shout The conceit upon which ""Kingsman The Secret Service"" rests is a simple one. The service in question is international filthy rich and independent of any government although it is based in London and staffed by British agents. They are modelled on the Round Table with sobriquets to match Arthur (Michael Caine) Galahad (Colin Firth) Lancelot (Jack Davenport) and so on. They fight evil crime and other caddish deeds and the front for their headquarters is a tailors called Kingsman in Savile Row. The name is cunningly wrought combining hints of sovereignty and of Firths most lauded role in ""The Kings Speech"" with the actual firm of Huntsman in the same street. Some scenes were filmed at the Huntsman shop. You can drop by anytime and order a bespoke suit should you have seven thousand bucks going spare. In case all this sounds too decorous for its own good be advised that the director is Matthew Vaughn who made ""Kick-Ass"" (2010) and whose idea of decorum as far as I can gauge involves switching to slow motion in the wake of a savage punch the better to show us an uprooted tooth sailing gracefully by. The appeal of ""Kingsman"" depends on a calculated clash between this unbridled mayhem and the decency of the nicely bridled spies. In the cruellest sequence Firth diverting slightly from his role in ""Pride and Prejudice"" (1995) goes berserk in a church shooting or stabbing half the congregation burying a hatchet in the skull of one woman and impaling the preacher on a stake. Heaven forfend If you deem it unbecoming that Mr. Darcy should conduct himself thus the film has got you right in the britches. Your shock is part of the plan. The narrative parades its own absurdity. Eggsy (Taron Egerton) a working-class London lad whose father once spied and died for Kingsman is encouraged by Galahad to apply for the Round Table jockeying with a bunch of better-bred candidates for a single vacant spot. Meanwhile a lisping Internet billionaire named Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) has imprisoned various global leaders and is preparing to brainwash the wider population into a mass homicidal brawl. The template is early-to-mid James Bond as borne out by the trappings exploding cigarette lighters poisoned pens and a villains lair complete with a landing strip hewed into the side of a mountain. In case were slow on the uptake Galahad and Valentine agree over dinner on the sullenness that has infected late-period Bond and his kind. ""Give me a far-fetched diabolical plot any day"" Galahad says. Few recent movies have fetched quite as far as ""Kingsman"" and countless viewers will relish the brazen zest of its invention. When one mans head exploded in David Cronenbergs ""Scanners"" (1981) we felt the pressure of some uncontainable horror. When a hundred heads explode as they do in ""Kingsman"" bursting with the colors of the rainbow and trumpeted by Elgars ""Land of Hope and Glory"" we are meant to rise and applaud a pretty sight. Whats not to like? Well for one thing the striking of mean political poses. Take the dinner chez Valentine at which a silver carving dome is opened to show Big Macs and fries. Would a white baddie have been saddled with a similar gag? Female characters are no more than also-rans and most of the male ones are stiff with stereotyping. Eggsy aside the lower orders are feckless louts while the look and the sound of their posh counterparts seem to have been devised by someone leafing through a copy of the Tatler from 1983. This is pitiful stuff and like the violence it eats away at the blitheness for which ""Kingsman"" strives leaving an aftertaste of desperation that the Connery of ""Goldfinger"" say would not have dreamed of bequeathing. The sadness is that Firth alone in the film does raise the spectre of those days radiating a lightly amused reserve amid the havoc. I loved the sigh that he emits in a pub having put down his pint of Guinness before laying into a squad of angry assailants. It is the sigh of a gentleman--of a gentle man--who is obliged to play rough in a tiresome world that is made for naughty boys. Anybody who hears about ""What We Do in the Shadows"" from secondhand reports will fear the worst. The movie deals in nothing but exhausted tropes. One its a mock documentary. Two its a vampire flick a genre that after five attacks of ""Twilight"" has officially succumbed to hardened arteries. And three the new film counts as horror comedy; what seemed a delectable mixture when Bela Lugosi stalked into ""Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein"" (1948) has grown stale with the years. It was with both joy and mystification therefore that I found myself cackling at ""What We Do in the Shadows"" like a witch with a helium balloon. The first laugh comes after eighteen seconds an alarm clock set for six oclock begins to beep and a groping hand turns it off. Weve seen that many times onscreen but here the hand reaches out from a coffin raising the creaky lid. The time is six in the evening and Viago (Taika Waititi) is getting up. ""Ziss is alvays really szcary part for me"" he tells us timidly twitching the curtains to make sure that darkness has fallen. Instantly we are on his side for Viago is that rarest of beasts the true innocent. He has an adorable smile a flutter of vanity (he is costumed like an eighteenth-century beau) and a bent for politesse. O.K. he asks a girl over and chews her neck setting off rococo fountains of gore but as he says afterward facing the camera in his drenched lace ""On ze upside I sink she had a really good time"" Viago lives in Wellington the capital of New Zealand. (The film purports to be made by ""The New Zealand Documentary Board."") He shares an apartment with three guys all of them heavy boozers of blood. There is Deacon (Jonathan Brugh) who hasnt done the dishes in five years; Vladislav (Jemaine Clement) who gives himself Byronic airs but has never recovered from an apocalyptic feud with someone or something called the Beast; and Petyr (Ben Fransham) who is eight thousand years old and looks like Nosferatus grandpa. Petyr doesnt get out much whereas the others are forever cruising the nightspots of Wellington--smartening up before they leave though naturally unable to check the result in the mirror. Vampirism has its uses (Viago and his pals can fly and turn into bats) but parts of it really suck. ""I cant sunbathe I cant watch daytime TV."" So says Nick (Cori Gonzalez-Macuer) adding ""Dont believe the hype."" Nick is new to the game. He came over one evening and stayed for a bite. Now he too is one of the gang grudgingly accepted by his roommates. The person they do like is his friend Stu (Stuart Rutherford) a regular human and so sensationally dull that vampires dont worry him in the least. Also they are musty in matters of hi-tech so why bother to kill Stu when he can show them how to find stuff on Google? (""I lost a really nice szilk scarf in about 1912"" Viago says.) There is one other mortal in the mix Jackie (Jackie van Beek) a no-nonsense type who helps with domestic tasks. The vampires have promised her eternal life but in the meantime as she admits ""Im stuck here ironing their fucking frills."" Clement and Waititi are not just the stars of this enterprise but also its writers and directors. Flight of the Conchords fans will know Clement as one half of the band; he was also directed by Waititi in ""Eagle vs. Shark"" (2007). That augurs well but it still doesnt prepare you for the uncanny lure of ""What We Do in the Shadows."" The hitch with the majority of spoofs--the dismal ""Scary Movie"" franchise say--is that they pull their stunts in a void. When one target of lampoon has been hit (or more likely aimed at and missed) there is nothing more for the film to do but swivel randomly toward the next. By contrast what the new movie demonstrates is that eccentricity and outrage prove their worth and acquire their comic shape only when squeezed into the confines of the workaday world--the world of Jackie and Stu. What happens when the haywire hits the humdrum? How should the dead or the undead adjust to the rhythms of the quick? The quest for answers is what drives this tale guards its deadpan mood and guarantees the blast of its finale. This is set at the Unholy Masquerade an annual fancy-dress bash where the vampires club together with the zombies banshees and other mutants who infest Wellington. At last the identity of the Beast is revealed in all its majesty while that of Stu who has perhaps unwisely come as a plus one is soon challenged ""Are you a demon?"" ""Im a software analyst"" he replies. Nothing rattles Stu. My one regret is that the documentary crew was not present for the year when Viago went to the party as Whoopi Goldberg from ""Sister Act"" to the chagrin of his peers. (""Vampires dont like nuns."") Still we do get a snapshot of his outfit and it repays consideration here is a half-Maori half-Jewish actor playing a three-hundred-and-seventy-nine-year-old satanic dandy playing an African-American bride of Christ.

Colin Firth plays Harry Hart one of an elite band of impeccably dressed crimefighters aligned with no specific government but steeped in old money and aristocratic privilege. When one of their number pops his clogs unexpectedly Harry tries to fulfil an old promise by bringing latchkey bruiser Eggsy (Taron Egerton) into the Kingsman fold with explosive consequences.Never less than slick precision-tooled multiplex entertainment Kingsman hews close to the formula Vaughn and his co-writer Jane Goldman established in their superficially similar Kick-Ass hyperspeed action pithy one-liners and grotesque ultraviolence. Firth plays it straight up with a smirky twist Egerton is a likeable frontman and there are winning cameos from Michael Caine as a shifty bureau chief and Mark Hamill as - get this - a fusty British science professor. But like Kick-Ass Kingsman can leave a sour taste. The script has a penchant for nasty lads-mag humour while attempts to play on timely themes of privilege versus poverty fall flat thanks to a crass reactionary depiction of working-class life. If all youre after are sharp suits quickfire gags and spectacular kill-shots (one unforgettable sequence is destined to go down in exploding-head history) Kingsman is undoubtedly worth the ticket price.

TWITTER Old-school spycraft meets cartoonish high jinks in a comic book adaptation starring Colin Firth and Samuel L. Jackson Playing a world-saving and somewhat world-weary superagent Colin Firth is the epitome of suave as lethal as he is elegant in the spy thriller Kingsman The Secret Service. His sad-eyed heroics ground the comic book adaptation while Samuel L. Jackson brings the goofball villainy big-time as a mad genius who concocts a ticking time bomb of a scheme. As he did in X-Men First Class director Matthew Vaughn strikes an energetic balance between cartoonish action and character-driven drama though the tinge here is darker with a story that hinges on matters of climate change the insidiousness of technology and the class divide. The mix grows less seamless and the story loses oomph as it barrels toward its doomsday countdown but the casts dash and humor never flag. And if the movie sometimes panders shamelessly to fanboys that could serve it well upon its February release when it goes head-to-head against a fantasy of another persuasion Fifty Shades of Grey. Just as the cast combines masterly screen vets and impressive newcomers the film embraces old-school undercover sensibilities while updating them. A self-contained adventure as opposed to a franchise-launching introductory chapter the screenplay by Vaughn and Jane Goldman is based on a comic book series by Kick-Ass writer Mark Millar and Watchmen artist Dave Gibbons (published by Marvel imprint Icon). Like its source material it uses pop culture references to sharp effect. My Fair Lady for example provides an unlikely punch line. And theres more than a touch of Bond -- James Bond -- in the globe-trotting London-based escapades.

Headed by the inscrutable Arthur (an extended cameo by Michael Caine) theyre latter-day Knights of the Round Table. Firths Harry Hart code-named Galahad finds a new sense of purpose as mentor to petty criminal Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin (Taron Egerton). Sponsoring the teen as a recruit for the Secret Service Harrys not just trying to save a street-smart kid from a rudderless existence with his troubled mother (Samantha Womack) and her abusive boyfriend (Geoff Bell); hes atoning for the botched mission 17 years earlier that cost the life of Eggsys dad (Jack Davenport) aka Lancelot. That mission a high-body-count fracas involving a kidnapped professor (Mark Hamill) in a ski chateau opens the film and sets the tone of jokey mayhem and stylized gore. Making flamboyant first impressions in the scene are Jacksons cellphone gazillionaire Valentine and his sleek murderous assistant Gazelle (Sofia Boutella) named for the flexible-blade prosthetics she wears a la Oscar Pistorius. In the present day Valentine whose idiosyncrasies include a prominent lisp and a squeamishness about blood that doesnt stop him from wreaking havoc is preparing to press play on a devilishly logical plan to save the human race from the devastation of climate change. The ultimate showdown grows numbing in its back-and-forth although the screenplays clever use of Eggsys toddler sibling brings home the panic with impact. Read more Secret Service Comic Gets Movie Tie-In Cover Vaughn and Goldman whose previous screenwriting collaborations include Kick-Ass root the storys crazy gizmos including Valentines use of SIM cards as weapons of mass destruction in recognizable tech from biometrics to satellites and mainframes. Less recognizable and something to behold are Firths graceful martial arts moves. Exaggerated by effects and editing they create a form of live-action animation that reaches its apex (or nadir depending on your view of over-the-top violence) in a sequence set to the wail of Lynyrd Skynyrds ""Free Bird"" that pits Harry against the congregation of a Southern church. Nominally hes a soldier in the culture wars but that doesnt quite hold up as more than a cheap shot in the context of the action. The true engines of the movie are the chalk-and-cheese contrast between Firths and Jacksons characters and the understated father-son dynamic between Harry and Eggsy. In his first major big-screen role Welsh actor Egerton captures the characters resentment and suspicion as well as his longing to make something of himself and to be like Harry who can coolly lay waste to a barroom of hooligans between sips of his pint. Beyond the unexpected physicality that Firth brings to the part he imbues Harry with a bone-dry wit. Theres also something unfulfilled in his bespectacled eyes. The longing finds eloquent unsentimental expression when he brings Eggsy to the Kingsman haberdashery to be fitted for his first bespoke suit and to get his first glimpse of the organizations stylishly deadly gadgets (ace work here and throughout by production designer Paul Kirby and costume designer Arianne Phillips). Lending strong unfussy support are Sophie Cookson as Eggsys chief competition and only friend in spy school where hes a pleb among posh upper-crust types and the dependable Mark Strong as Scottish spy Merlin who trains the wannabe agents and oversees the groups inventive arsenal -- the storys equivalent of the Bondian character Q. Reviewed in nearly final form the widescreen feature pops with sharp action including a brief bit of parkour and a car chase in reverse. Until choppiness overcomes the final section all of it is choreographed with urgency by cinematographer George Richmond and enhanced by Henry Jackman and Matthew Margesons lush score. The humor pops too but a late-in-the-proceedings sex joke involving a Swedish princess (Hanna Alstrom) comes across as a desperate bid for edginess. (Not yet rated stateside the film received a 15 certificate in Britain after some violent images were cut.) The gag is crude and out of tune with the rest of the movie. Harry Hart its safe to say would not be amused. Production companies Marv Cloudy Cast Colin Firth Samuel L.

For those who think James Bond has gotten a little too serious in his old age ""Kingsman The Secret Service"" brings the irreverence back to the British spy genre offering a younger streetwise variation on the 007 formula while gleefully pushing audiences favorite elements -- sartorial taste killer toys and cracked-out supervillains -- to hyperbolic extremes. Based on Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons 2012 comicbook series and directed by Matthew Vaughn in much the same pop over-the-top style as his earlier ""Kick-Ass"" Foxs franchise-ready one-off at first poses as a more teen-friendly option before taking a hard turn into decidedly R-rated territory. For nearly three-quarters of its running time ""Kingsman"" could pass as a flip PG-13 alternative to the increasingly gritty turn the genre has taken in the wake of Jason Bourne -- a fact it acknowledges outright when debonair operative Harry Hart (Colin Firth) and cuckoo billionaire Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) talk spy-movie aesthetics. ""Give me a far-fetched diabolical plot"" Jacksons wonderfully eccentric villain says with a lisp ""like the old Bond movies."" But the film also reserves the right to go gonzo in its final stretch and while theres sure to be an outcry from some corners over the turning-point scene no one can contest that the pics last couple of reels distinguish it from countless other spy-movie knockoffs. And lets not forget that Vaughn effectively gave Daniel Craig a bespoke 007 audition with the slick 2004 crime caper ""Layer Cake."" Here the helmer launches yet another British talent Welsh actor Taron Egerton a compact bulldog-like actor with a square jaw and squinched-up features who goes from scallie tough to Savile Row neat over the course of the film -- a ""Pygmalion""-like transformation that is hardly lost on the character himself. Egerton plays Gary ""Eggsy"" Unwin whose father dies in service of an organization so secret his widow and son never realize the significance of his sacrifice which serves as the first of several punchy setpieces in a pic thats front-loaded with action scenes. Ignorant of his own potential Eggsy grows up in a grim South London housing estate falls in with a group of good-for-nothing thugs and risks spending his remaining years behind bars. At least thats the way things are headed until Harry springs him from prison and offers him an alternative to replace recently fallen agent Lancelot (Jack Davenport) who died in a violent yet admirably bloodless attempt to free a kidnapped scientist (a heavily made-up Mark Hamill the casting of whom plays as an inside joke for fans of the original comic wherein its the missing ""Star Wars"" star who needs rescuing). The scientist is one of many prominent figures whove vanished as Valentine readies his far-fetched diabolical plot. And so two elaborate yet extremely well-oiled mechanisms are set in motion. In the first we get young Eggsy thrust into a high-stakes boot camp to determine which of a group of new recruits (the rest of whom are all posh prep-school types) is worthy of becoming the next Kingsman. At the same time Valentine moves forward with his plan to distribute free SIM cards programmed to trigger an aggressive killing frenzy worldwide thereby solving the climate-change crisis by eradicating all but a hand-picked elite. Class plays a key role in ""Kingsman"" which hinges on the fantasy that a kid from the projects could assimilate into Londons most exclusive circles. Hidden behind a suit-shop storefront on Savile Row Kingsman HQ are accessed through a series of ""Get Smart""-style secret doors and tunnels while the group itself is presided over by an old blue blood played by Michael Caine. But these elite types have a critical weakness They believe their own superiority which makes them no better than Valentine in the end. (In one throwaway gag Jackson is seen pitching his plan at the White House to a man clearly intended to be President Obama.) Together with longtime screenwriting partner Jane Goldman Vaughn milks these class differences for maximum amusement throughout embracing the notion that ""Kingsman"" is as much a comedy as it is an action movie -- just not in the corny quippy way that mid-career Bond used to be. Its the sort of movie where the worlds most cultured men prefer to eat McDonalds behind closed doors while its streetwise protagonist boasts a far snobbier martini recipe than Bond ever did. Few of the years films have been so openly covetous of material possessions which sits oddly with the movies open resentment of extreme wealth. After all Vaughn belongs to that school of directing whose glossy hyper-polished pics look almost like feature-length commercials where every outfit and prop is potentially for sale (the suits designed by Arianne Phillips will soon be made available for online purchase via Mr Porter). But he also kicked off his career producing for Guy Ritchie whose dynamic rough-and-tumble attitude has clearly been a key influence on his approach most obvious in a virtuoso pub altercation where the camera varies speeds as it ducks and loops around the action. Its as if style is the only thing Vaughn holds sacred while extreme convictions on religious or political grounds are something to be ridiculed and in two jaw-droppingly irreverent sequences wiped from the face of the earth. On the style front Firth comes across as an extreme caricature of perceived elegance ultra-cool within the normally priggish confines of custom-tailored London fashion. Hes an impeccably dressed action figure capable of dispatching a room full of goons without so much as wrinkling his suit. Valentines no slouch either his DayGlo look adapted more to fit Jacksons flamboyant persona than the characters socially awkward idiosyncrasies (which include an amusingly paradoxical aversion to the sight of blood). And because a great villain is judged in part by the quality of his henchpersons ""Kingsman"" introduces Algerian dancer Sofia Boutella (""StreetDance 2"") as Valentines lethal valet Gazelle -- a sultry improvement over ""Goldfingers"" Oddjob with legs that have been replaced with razor-sharp powerbocks. So while seriousness has overtaken the Bond franchise in recent years (hardly a bad thing mind you) ""Kingsman"" runs no such risk. Vaughn welcomes details that might seem silly in another directors hands such as a bulletproof umbrella or tiny microchips that can make ones head explode presenting everything playfully enough that plausibility isnt a factor. Its all a question of attitude really from the films funky score (which clearly owes a debt to John Barry) to cocky newcomer Egerton who looks plenty tough speeding backward through oncoming traffic or skydiving without a chute but softens up the instant hes asked to train a Pug puppy. In another progressive touch the film objectifies its shirtless star far more than it does a rival recruit played by Sophie Cookson who can hold her own against him during training. Whether its ""Alex Rider"" ""Agent Cody Banks"" or ""Spy Kids"" plenty have tried to adapt the 007 shtick to younger characters with demonstrably dopey results. In the end the reason it works for Vaughn is that hes making the film for adults. (Spoiler alert.) The studio reportedly pushed back on several touchy scenes including one that plays like a surreal dream sequence from another movie (like Kevin Smiths ""Red State"" perhaps) as hatemongering members of a Westboro-style congregation flip out and spontaneously start attacking one another but Vaughn fought to maintain the films edge. Though ""Kingsman The Secret Service"" doesnt open for several more weeks the ill-considered church massacre remained in the not-quite-finished version screened for review -- precisely the sort of imagery Hollywood studios hastily pull the instant some real-world tragedy strikes only to find themselves propagating anew once the dust settles.

Amanda Jo Ross says May 18 2015 at 630 am i loved the movie Kingsman am a James Bond fan for years - this movie was fresh and funny better than any James Bond movie - loved the effects and the lines were up todate and clever well done - looking forward to seeing more of Kingsmen - great job great actors Reply DG says May 13 2015 at 913 pm Usually a fan of action packed spy thrillers but the gratuitous violence and misogynistic pornographic pointless ending made me ask why? Why ruin a great movie with scenes that do nothing to advance the plot why ruin a great movie with a closing scene thousands of young women will see that denigrates them without enhancing the characters as multidimensional? Sexist and pathetic dont waste your money. Reply John Smith says February 25 2015 at 845 pm Whatever fun the trailer lead you to believe would be had was quickly buried under the twisted psychology that is the expression of Matthew Vaughns mind. Excessive Violence excessive hatred excessive bigotry and excessive blood just for the sake of it. The church scene was in very bad taste and the only reason to pick on the Christian faith is because Matthew Vaughn hates Christians and fears reprisal from the Merida of other religions he could have chosen to represent irrational people. Why not ISIS radical Islam Hezbollah Hamas? The answer is that the coward Matthew Vaughn fears them. So HF attacks Christianity instead. He is an ignorant massaginistic fear-filled bigoted megalomaniac; who uses the screen to project his own twisted and childish soul rather than make movies that truly matter. Reply Bill Fold says February 10 2015 at 329 pm Will never see another movie with Samuel Scum Jackson who is a rst. Reply Eggy says February 16 2015 at 1230 pm What are you talking about? Have you somehow confused Samuel L. Jackson with Bill Cosby? Or are you writing this in your Klan robes while you plan your next lynching? Reply molo says February 6 2015 at 1123 pm Reblogged this on Rendezvous Magazine. Reply Floy Joy says January 25 2015 at 1011 pm Colin Firth in his saville-row suit and using his umbrella as a weapon is so obviously John Steed from the original and best ""The Avengers"" 60s tv series. Yet no mention of it Are these reviewers today 12 years old and only into comic-books?? Reply MCM says January 5 2015 at 854 am I didnt realise objectification was progressive whatever the object. Reply Benson F says December 29 2014 at 828 pm The beginning had me confused. What is the actual rating for the movie (PG-13 or R)? Reply Charles David Haskell says December 30 2014 at 944 am The actual rating for the movie that isnt confused me but I wanted to know will the movie be any good. From the clip that I saw it look like a winner. Reply LOL says December 28 2014 at 102 pm Matthew Vaughn is a snobby posho private school educated toff. Hes a spoilt aristocrats making money by pretending to be down with British chav culture. This is a movie made by a Tory supporter. Reply Charles David Haskell says December 28 2014 at 830 am I cant wait to see Kingsman The Secret Service when it finally debut in the theater. Reply Obvious Guy says December 28 2014 at 126 am I saw the trailer and found myself saying ""Its Wanted"" which makes sense as Wanted was also originally a comic book WRITTEN BY MARK MILAR...just like Kingsman. Seems like that comparison should have been made in this review along with the many others referenced? Reply CSW says December 27 2014 at 1031 pm I dont see how an R-rated movie seemingly targeted at a younger audience will perform well at the box office. Reply occultology says December 27 2014 at 856 am I was hoping that this film would be good and you made it sound great. I am pleased. Reply John Freimann says December 27 2014 at 107 pm Sounds like a winner; cant wait. However your opening sentence baffles me. Who would be so dumb as to think that the Bond films have gotten too serious? Youve got to stop listening to these idiots. Reply Charles David Haskell says December 27 2014 at 810 am I hope that Kingsman  The Secret Service turn out to be a hit and there will be a sequel real soon. Reply Charles David Haskell says December 27 2014 at 1159 am From the clip that I see. Kingsman the Secret Service will be a hit and I still hope that there will be a sequel real soon. I cant wait to see the film and than buy the DVD when it become available. Reply N.Ramers says February 15 2015 at 1204 am After the first part of the movie was trite but witty the church free-for-all bloody massacre scene was like having them throw dog-shit on you. I walked out as would anyone who cares what folks are exposed to. It was pointless violence orchestrated to see how much CRAP one movie could bombard people with before theyd object. Movies like this show just how low the masses have sank to be willing to go along with the sick humor. Dont support this gutter garbage. Glenn C. says December 27 2014 at 900 am Like the director. His style. Also like the concept. Should do well. Looking forward to it. Reply David L says February 24 2015 at 547 pm My favorite scene of the movie. Best sequence of action scenes that I can remember. See All 21 Comments More Film News from Variety The Power of Content HBO Boss Talks True Detective Season 3 Deadwood Movie... Chelsea Vs.

Fleet-footed and unrepentantly British its a reunion of sorts behind the scenes for Vaughn and comics writer Mark Millar but its infinitely better than their 2010 collaboration ""Kick-Ass."" Credit for that goes to Vaughns adaptation of the script alongside producer Jane Goldman which finds cheer and cleverness in Millars mixture of retro-style spy action with a snobs-versus-slobs twist. See video Kingsman The Secret Service Trailer Features Colin Firth as a Supremely Dapper Secret Agent (Video) The basics are basic indeed Super-spy Harry Hart (Colin Firth surprisingly capable and up for it) obligated to recruit a new member for the independent spy group from which the film takes its name chooses the grown-but-aimless son of a late comrade Gary Eggsy Unwin (Taron Egerton). Eggsy is put through his paces as a potential spy even as Hart investigates whether telecommunications mogul Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson playing a mix of Russell Simmons and Bill Gates by way of Blofeld with a comedy lisp) is the target of a round of kidnappings and killings or if he is in fact the mastermind behind them. With its fashion-forward flair -- the film may borrow liberally from the Roger Moore 007 era but theres also a touch of Patrick Macnees bespoked gentleman spy Mr. Steed from ""The Avengers"" -- ""Kingsman The Secret Service"" feels like a well-made gentlemans suit with superb cut distinctive color and excellent construction.  In terms of cut the films style is precise and yet broad with the hidden lairs jump-suited minions and maniacal villains of a long-gone era of Bond movies perfectly walking the fine line of mocking what it loves and vice versa. You get the gear the gadgets and the gusto but you also get sly winks at how ludicrous it all is; its a movie that fakes a stiff upper lip but also constantly raises its eyebrow in amusement. In terms of color important for both a film and a mens ensemble Vaughn has cast his film fairly perfectly. Firth is game and great in his computer-aided fight scenes and his dialogue delivery with Egerton a naturally charismatic presence with smarts behind his smile. Mark Strong plays gadgetmaster Merlin while Michael Caine is briefly brilliant as the head of Kingsman. Jackson goes for broke and strikes riches as Valentine supported by henchwoman Gazelle (Sofia Boutella) who sports a pair of sharpened-and-bladed prosthetic legs as divinely mad as any deadly dentures Richard Kiel ever wore as Jaws. The score by Henry Jackman and Matthew Margeson offers perfectly fun pastiches of John Barrys iconic work on the 007 films. Also read Kingsman The Secret Service Will Take on Fifty Shades at Box Office As for the construction its superb. The action may be ludicrous but its also engaging and delightful; the production design is all tributes and nods to other films and other bits of pop culture but ""Kingsman"" also creates a coherent world for itself. The scripts tone with a few notable disappointments is also zesty but rarely sour knowing yet rarely cynical. The British-isms arent sanded down for an American audience; Firth is a killer but never a brute and Eggsys up-from-the-bottom determination to do good is clear in every scene even as Egerton demonstrates charm in his acting and skill in his action work. And yet much like ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" ""Kingsman"" is marked and marred by a small group of scenes and decisions as regrettable and ruinous -- and more frustratingly removable -- as a garish mess of a rumpled pocket square or a soup-splattered tie. Specifically its another action film that feels it can get cheap laughs out of language and attitudes that insult women and womens sexuality in the name of amusing the audience in the basest way and so late in the game that it casts a pall over the fun thats gone before. Is it too much to ask for an action film that doesnt find coarse comedy about women and sex as obligatory as squibs explosions and product placement? Also read Fox at Comic-Con James Bond Is Whack Were Making Movies With Balls (and Jokes) Theres a lot to like about ""Kingsman The Secret Service"" and even the stain of its sexism cant rip the seams of its clever patchwork or wrinkle the creases in its smarts.
