"Asinine and tasteless but this films not funny | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesAsinine and tasteless but this films not funnyDavid Zucker fears reviewers will trash his movie because they dont like its politics. Well hes wrong about that. No matter where you stand on the political spectrum An American Caro l is simply not funny.By Susan WalkerENTERTAINMENT REPORTERSun. Oct. 12 2008(out of four)Starring Kevin Farley Kelsey Grammer and Leslie Nielsen. Directed by David Zucker. Written by Zucker Myrna Sokoloff and Lewis Friedman. 83 minutes. At major theatres. PG David Zucker fears reviewers will trash his movie because they dont like its politics. Well hes wrong about that. No matter where you stand on the political spectrum An American Carol is simply not funny.Article Continued BelowUtterly asinine sophomoric tasteless the movie has much in common with Zuckers Airplane The Naked Gun 2 1/2 and Scary Movie sequels minus the laughs. An American Carol is a mishmash of stupid gags and ill-conceived skits that wanders far from its central premise Michael Malone renegade anti-American documentary filmmaker is a Scrooge who wants to abolish the Fourth of July.Leslie Nielsen is a grandpa at an Independence Day family barbecue telling his grandchildren a tale that opens in the hills of Afghanistan where three Taliban Keystone Kops are frustrated with the poor quality of their recruitment film. The opening joke is a doozer their leader Aziz (Robert Davi) calls out ""Mohammed"" and 20 heads pop up in reply. Aziz and Ahmed and Mohammed three jihadist stooges go to Hollywood to enlist an anti-American director to make a film to inspire would-be suicide bombers. Kevin Farley plays Michael Malone a fat narcissistic documentary filmmaker whose latest doc is Die You American Pigs. Hes a gluttonous junk-food addict uncle to a marine with a flock of disabled children including one named Timmy. Malones hero John F. Kennedy steps out of a TV screen to warn him that hes on the wrong track with his campaign to abolish the Fourth of July. Three spirits will visit him. General Patton (Kelsey Grammer) is the ghost of Republicans past and leads Malone through a historical nightmare. The Taliban storyline along with the Christmas Carol theme gets all tangled up and nearly obliterated as Malone is taunted by seeing himself depicted as a slave owner and a Nazi lover. Bad renditions of historic figures from George Washington (Jon Voight) to Hitler to Jimmy Carter turn up to illustrate for Malone the error of his ways. The target here Michael Moore can rest easy in the knowledge that imitation even feeble mockery like this is the sincerest form of flattery.

Conservatives score a few political points but arent very funny in ""An American Carol"" a cheesy spitball directed at the very large target of a Michael Moore-like filmmaker. Poorly made indie production has a script that feels like a list of ripostes collected over the last several years to liberal criticisms of the U.S. The whole enterprise feels far more agenda- than entertainment-driven. Talkradio and grassroots marketing have been trying to rally the B.O. troops but the pics opening-weekend take of 3.8 million shows that the target audience is more likely to check this out when it takes over Wal-Mart shelves. Those with a real craving for hilariously potent anti-left propaganda will have to go back for another toke of ""Team America World Police."" The films very existence is being positioned as a bold exception to Hollywoods much-discussed liberal bent. But this collection of scattered potshots wont make the filmmakers ideological adversaries lose any sleep as its too feeble in everything but its political convictions to register significantly on the publics radar. Would-be hilarious setup has some Afghani Taliban types dismayed at the ineffectiveness of their recruiting videos deciding to hire a ""real Hollywood director"" to pump up their efforts. ""It shouldnt be hard"" one insists ""they all hate America."" The one they select is Michael Malone (Kevin Farley) a fat egomaniacal slob with a baseball cap whos leading a campaign to abolish the July 4th holiday while trying to make the jump from documentaries to dramatic features with his script ""Fascist America."" As the embarrassingly bumbling terrorists plot to use Malone for their own ends the scruffy man himself in a lift from Dickens ""A Christmas Carol"" is visited by eminent Americans who endeavor to make him see the error of his pacifist ways. First JFK (Chriss Anglin) steps out of his inauguration newsreel to tell Malone ""You must redeem yourself"" and to recognize the need to be prepared to face any foe. Then Gen. George Patton (Kelsey Grammer) materializes to slap Malone around a bit before taking him to Munich 1939 where he watches Neville Chamberlain shining Hitlers shoes while the fuehrer Mussolini and Tojo sing ""Kumbaya."" Brief sketches also reveal to the filmmaker how Southern blacks would still be enslaved had not Lincoln taken up arms why Malone came to hate the military -- his youthful sweetheart left him for a soldier -- and how zombies (in the form of ACLU lawyers) have to be mowed down before they completely overwhelm the court system. George Washington (Jon Voight who on the evidence could plausibly play the first president in a serious manner) then lectures Malone on freedom before the doors of New Yorks St. Pauls Chapel to reveal the ruins of 9/11. Oddly the dialogue contains more zingers about the lowliness of the life form known as documentary filmmaker than anything else. A mock propaganda film makes lively fun of Rosie ODonnells equating Christian fundamentalists with Islamic terrorists and given the parallel with Dickens the intended audience will know it can look forward to a contrite apology and conversion at the end from the wayward Malone. But the irreverence wit and invention director David Zucker displayed in most of his earlier comedies are largely MIA. Comic timing is lacking and unattractive pic has a slapdash low-budget backlot feel. Film proper runs just 78 minutes with six minutes of end credits. As a number of eminent filmmakers have demonstrated conservatives can do a lot better than this.

A Red State riposte that parodies Oscar-winning documentarian Michael Moore and his perceived lack of patriotism An American Carol takes Dickens - Scrooge ghosts lessons learned - and moves it from Christmas to the Fourth of July from London of yore to a backyard barbecue crowded with Main Streeters that would do Sarah Palin proud. At a picnic table old Grandpa (Leslie Nielsen) regales the kids with his tale of ""a director who really really hates America."" That would be Michael Malone (Kevin Farley schlubby in cap and jeans) whose most recent doc is called Die You American Pigs Malone is campaigning to do away with Independence Day - his protest against the corrupt warmongers running the country. But then the ghosts of George Washington (Jon Voight) Gen. George Patton (Kelsey Grammer) and the Angel of Death (country star Trace Adkins) materialize to show Malone the error of his ways. What if Lincoln hadnt fought the Civil War? And what if Roosevelt had heeded the demonstrators opposing U.S. involvement in the fight against the Nazis? Equating Malone with Hitlers moviemaking propagandist Leni Riefenstahl Zucker goes on to offer a mix of lame sight gags and lamer satirical jabs at left-leaning celebs. Zucker has made some funny movies in his day. With partners Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker hes created a template for genre spoofery thats been ripped off a hundred times since Robert Stack and Peter Graves climbed into 1980s Airplane But An American Carol is about as not-funny as a comedy can get. Farley not only fails to pull off a credible Michael Moore impersonation he also fails in his few attempts at simple farce. And that trio of inept jihadists?

"Movie review An American Carol -- 1 of 5 stars - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Orlando Sentinel Movie review An American Carol -- 1 of 5 stars Roger MooreSentinel Movie Critic One hundred and sixty-five years after Charles Dickens called for civic reform compassion humanity and charity to be watchwords in human life with A Christmas Carol Hollywoods most rabid conservatives have rallied to make An American Carol a comedy that equates dissent with ""treason"" that presents Bill OReilly as a model of political restraint and offers us Kelsey Grammer as the ghost of General George S. Patton.Yeah when I think ""Blood and Guts"" I think Frasier. David Zucker late of the Airplane and The Naked Gun movies a fellow who hasnt been funny in roughly 165 years trots out that Canadian fossil Leslie Nielsen as a grandpa telling a tale about a Michael Moore-like ""Scrooge"" who wanted to ban the Fourth of July holiday. A liberal who ""hates America""-- and is by the way ""fat"" -- is visited by the ghosts of John F. Kennedy Patton George Washington ( Jon Voight) and the Angel of Death (Trace Adkins whos no Toby Keith) sees the error of his ways and promises to always keep the Fourth forever more.Well God bless us every one Mr. Zucker Pity those crippled kids in the movie cant get good health care or stem cell research because those arent conservative values but I digress. Its a polemic a screed a combination comic rant and sentimental flag-waver that doesnt work as either. Start with the casting of Chris Farleys singularly unfunny brother Kevin as Michael Malone. Yeah he looks like Michael Moore. But youll be making your own ""The wrong Farley.. .. ."" jokes and you can finish that thought.Too mean? How about shooting ACLU lawyers ""zombies"" waiving their writs trying to protect ""privacy"" in the face of the ongoing terrorist threat? Or labeling Hitler a liberal? Uh Dave seriously check the tailpipe on your Mercedes. Fumes must be getting into the passenger compartment. Hitler was a racist anti-Semite uniform-loving flag-waving fascist a k a an ultra-ultra-conservative.The movies basic thesis that some folks dont think theres any such thing as a ""just war"" is as absurd as it gets. Except that isnt as absurd as it gets. The movies history is as distorted as its classic straw-man propaganda. Whats a straw man? Thats when you set up an argument that you claim the other side is making one made of straw thats easy for you to knock down.Like a blind monkey the joke-o-matic Zucker uses here lands the odd giggle -- about country music Scientology documentaries (not ""real"" movies) and those silly silly Islamic terrorists. Here theyre led by Robert Davi and a very bad hairpiece conspiring to wreak some fresh havoc on an America too busy protecting its civil liberties to remember were at war.Malone maker of such documentary hits as Die You American Pigs who so wants to direct a fiction feature (Fascist America) visits a South where no Civil War freed the slaves (from their conservative masters BTW) a pandering Neville Chamberlain listening to Hitler sing ""Kumbaya"" and speaks to rallies of college kids and movealong.org protesters who chant ""Peace now we dont care how"" and such.Most cringe-worthy he hears the Yankee-accented Washington lecture him about ""freedom of speech which you abuse."" And he endures lots of fat jokes and small children calling him obscene names. Funny.Its a mean little red-meat mess of a movie pandering of the most cynical kind. Zucker who converted his own politics in 2004 is playing to the suckers in a grand faux redneck tradition. He gets most everything wrong but no matter. The rubes who eat this garbage up wont know.But heres a tip. George Washington may have owned slaves and been overly fond of his uniform but he was nobodys idea of a conservative or a chest-thumper for war. We had conservatives in America in 1776. We called them then what they still call conservatives in Britain Tories. Only after being on the wrong side of change and history in 1782 most of our Tories packed up and moved to Canada.Give it some thought Mr. Zucker. And take that pansy Grammer with you.

(sam emerson/vivendi entertainment) By Ty Burr Globe Staff / October 4 2008 Email| Print| Single Page| | Text size - + ""An American Carol"" is that rare bird a conservative Hollywood comedy and a very self-conscious one it is too. Since the director and co-writer is David Zucker who once upon a time gave us ""Airplane"" and the ""Naked Gun"" movies (and who has more recently busied himself with the ""Scary Movie"" franchise) you go in at least hoping for some smart ribald slapstick aimed at the lefts sacred cows. Its there but the targets are bigger and lazier than they ought to be and the lectures are nonstop.Lord knows Michael Moore is overdue for a goring even the strident Mad magazine-style satire this movie dishes out. The Scrooge in ""An American Carol"" is ""Michael Malone"" (Kevin Farley a ringer for his late comedian brother Chris) a slobbo baseball-cap-wearing documentary filmmaker whose most recent work is ""Die You American Pig"" and whose mantra is ""I love America. Thats why I want to destroy it.""On the eve of a rally to abolish the Fourth of July (really?) Malone is visited by the spirit of JFK (Chris Anglinn) who foretells further visits by three angels who will show him the proper American way of thinking. Cue Kelsey Grammer as a hell-for-leather General George Patton Jon Voight as George Washington and country singer Trace Adkins as the Angel of Death. You can make your own joke about that last one.At its loosest and goofiest ""An American Carol"" which didnt screen for critics tosses high-spirited cherry bombs against perceived liberal sins The Leni Riefenstahl documentary award ceremony is a hoot and the attack of the ACLU zombie attorneys is funny no matter what side youre on. The bit where Robert Davis Islamic terrorist removes his fake beard to reveal a real beard beneath is a classic throwaway Zucker sight gag. At such points you wonder if Americas real enemies - without and within - are those who cant take a joke.""An American Carol"" is on a mission though and its not to convert hearts and minds but to play to the choir. Why else draft Bill OReilly to play himself opposite Malone and a crude ""Rosie OConnell"" caricature (Vicki Browne)? Why else treat the script like a series of Republican talking points?The cream of conservative Hollywood turns up in small roles from Dennis Hopper as a judge (yes I know) to Leslie Nielsen as the foxy Grandpa narrating the tale and you sense its a relief for some of them to come out of the closet. I cant imagine whats going through David Alan Griers head though Hes playing a slave in a fantasy modern-day America that never fought the Civil War (because if Malone had had his way Lincoln would have been a pacifist like Neville Chamberlain).When in doubt Zucker takes the high road of supporting US strength against those silly old jihadists at one point pulling the curtain to reveal the smoking ruins of the World Trade Center. Patriotism always trumps reasoned dissent here and if not the movie implies it should. (Whats that you ask? Whyd we go to war in Iraq if Al Qaeda was in Afghanistan? Shhhh.)Ultimately the problem with ""An American Carol"" is the problem with far too much political discourse in this country left or right It highlights the worst excesses of the opposition for the sole purpose of discrediting the vast middle. As cartoons go its a not unwelcome change-up from pious unexamined Hollywood platitudes (as opposed to the tough field work done in some recent documentaries). You could argue of course that a cartoon is the last thing we need at the moment.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2008 Globe Newspaper Company.

George Patton and Bill OReilly (as himself) in ""An American Carol"" which surely has two of them - not to mention Charles Dickens - rolling in their graves. Even if it werent three years too late to parody Moore (ineptly played by Kevin Farley) Moores ridiculous tribute to Cuban health care in ""Sicko"" is far funnier than anything in this desperately laughless farce from David Zucker (""Scary Movie 3""). There is however a spectacularly tasteless scene in which George Washington (a waxworks Jon Voight) gives ""Michael Malone"" a tour of the World Trade Center ruins - which I dont think was intentionally supposed to be funny. There are many fat jokes centering around Malone who is being duped by al Qaeda agents in a plot to blow up Madison Square Garden on July 4. Thats when JFK enlists Patton (Kelsey Grammer) to slap some conservative talking points into our hero. Also embarrassing themselves in ""An American Carol"" are Leslie Nielsen Dennis Hopper James Woods and Paris Hilton - the latter as herself struggling to deliver a joke involving Nazi filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl. While its unusual to see a Hollywood comedy aimed at conservatives OReilly pretty well sums up the movies mission ""You tell the audience what it wants to hear."" Toilet humor and the jokes about gays Muslims and the handicapped are just gravy. AN AMERICAN CAROL Singing to the choir. Running time 82 minutes. Rated PG-13 (rude humor).

Mohammed ""Mo"" Amer and Azhar Usman make fun of themselves -- their wife and mother jokes are universal; much of their ethnic shtick could be Jewish or Italian -- and their situation. Amer bounds onstage expressing incredulity ""This is a lot of room for a Palestinian"" The heavily bearded Usman starts immediately with bin Laden jokes. Usman is less cautious than Amer -- a good vaudevillian he rags on Jews and Catholics as well as South Asians -- but he still stops well short of any irreverence. And Allah Made Me Funny is a relative concept Its obvious that Amer and Usman labor under the burden of making humor at once insider-cool and outsider-friendly. And its hard to finesse ""offensive"" from a defensive crouch. The most skilled comic of the three is the nation of Islam convert Bryant ""Preacher"" Moss who not only evokes Saddam Hussein but goes on to imagine him as a black man in court arguing with the judge. ""The U.S. is scared by two things"" Moss riffs. ""I got the best of both worlds."" Hes completely self-referential. Perhaps self-satirizing his faith will be next.(Sunset 5) (J. Hoberman) AN AMERICAN CAROL In this astonishingly inept alleged satire from director and co-writer David Zucker -- an even more virulent us-against-them jeremiad than Bill Mahers Religulous -- a bumbling trio of Islamic terrorists set off for America in search of a Hollywood director to help them make a recruitment video for suicide bombers. They find their white knight in slovenly Michigan-born documentary maker Michael Malone (get it?) whose credits include Die You American Pigs and No Country for Anyone and who in turn finds his latent patriotic impulses stirred by visits from the ghosts of JFK George S. Patton and George Washington (played I kid you not by Jon Voight). The jokes such as they are come at the expense of people named ""Mohammed"" or ""Hussein"" vegans homosexuals and pretty much anyone who dares to question authority. In the most grotesque musical number this side of From Justin to Kelly a chorus line of leering pot-smoking academics conflates higher learning with liberal brainwashing but its Zucker who is the real revisionist historian here equating peace negotiations with Appeasement; likening Moore/Malone (Kevin Farley) to Leni Riefenstahl; invoking the Civil War as an argument against pacifism. Theres been one razor-sharp cultural lampoon at the movies this year -- Adam Sandlers Dont Mess With the Zohan -- although Zuckers achievement may in fact be more remarkable. His movies level of political discourse makes Couric/Palin look like Frost/Nixon.  (Selected theaters) (Scott Foundas) GO  BEVERLY HILLS CHIHUAHUA Undersized lapdogs make me grumpy even when they dont talk wear pink booties and shop Rodeo Drive. So I came to Beverly Hills Chihuahua with poison pen at the ready -- only to be won over by the exuberant charms of Raja Gosnells comedy about a snobby privileged Chihuahua named Chloe (voiced by Drew Barrymore) and her similarly spoiled-rotten 90210 dog sitter (Piper Perabo). The twosome grow some backbone when they get lost in the bowels of Baja where the pooch must be rescued from the clutches of Mexican dogfight wranglers. If the studios are finally going to make their mark on Latino audiences they could do a lot worse than this wicked satire on Beverly Hills pet excess with its sharp script a fun performance by Jamie Lee Curtis as Chloes overindulgent owner and a mostly Spanish-speaking cast that includes Andy Garcia as a clapped-out police dog Cheech Marin as a cunning rat whos after Chloes Harry Winston collar and George Lopez as a Chihuahua from the wrong side of the tracks who loves Chloe. This being Disney wholesome character-building messages abound but for once theyre freshly spun as cautions against stereotyping both ethnic and canine. And if having seen Beverly Hills Chihuahua your children grow up without the desire to turn their pets into idiot fashion accessories or extensions of their own shopaholic fantasies so much the better.

Sep. 13 600pm GO  BLINDNESS The most recent example of bleak chic Fernando Meirelles mostly harrowing adaptation of Jose Saramagos international bestseller Blindness is unflinching at best and treacly at worst. Set in a gray and metallic modern metropolis (actually Sao Paolo mixed in with Montevideo and Toronto) the film like the novel opens with a man (Yusuke Iseya) in a car stopped at a traffic light who suddenly loses his vision. Another man (actor-screenwriter Don McKellar) who drives him home and later steals his car also falls prey to the mysterious ""white blindness"" as does the first victims doctor (Mark Ruffalo). Soon the entire human population finds itself engulfed in a milky sightlessness save inexplicably one the doctors wife (Julianne Moore). Meirelles working with his Brazilian cinematographer Cesar Charlone establishes the plagues outbreak with visual flair evoking the experience of the ivory blindness through blurry and brightly overexposed frames. Like Saramago Meirelles doesnt much care about the medical or psychological specifics of blindness nor is he interested in the fate of any one human but rather humanity as a whole. (Theres obviously a grand metaphor here -- people are ""blind"" -- but its pretty simplistic.) Panned in Cannes Blindness has since lost a reportedly ponderous voice-over spoken by Danny Glover who appears as a sagely old man with a none-too-subtle eye-patch -- undoubtedly a wise move. The movie is strongest when its not trying to say anything but instead conveying the sheer desperation of its characters. Blindness pulls the viewer into its nightmarish vision and dares us to watch how humankind -- at the level of both governments and individuals -- fails to cope in times of chaos. And considering the current headlines maybe thats insightful enough. (Citywide) (Anthony Kaufman)  GO  BOOGIE MAN THE LEE ATWATER STORY Just about everyone interviewed for Stefan Forbes fascinating documentary about Lee Atwater -- whether Democrat or Republican pols African-American bluesmen or hardened reporters -- ends anecdotes about the Republican strategists dirty tricks with a titter thats either nervous or ambivalently appreciative. Politically speaking it may be enough to know that Atwater who shamelessly drove race into the 1988 presidential campaign to destroy Michael Dukakis and win the election for George Bush Sr. was a disciple of Strom Thurmond got along like a house on fire with Bush Jr. and taught Karl Rove most of what he knows about exploiting media. But Forbes adroitly fills out his picture of this ""marsupial"" little man with ""the eyes of a killer"" through the testimony of those who admired and/or loathed Atwater. Less persuasive is Forbes perfunctory psychologically thin rummage through Atwaters childhood for a traumatic event that would explain his utter ruthlessness. He finds one but its much less interesting than the question of whether the blues-playing Southerner was a racist or merely a cynic or the films revelations about the ambiguities of Atwaters highly publicized remorse with hand on Bible as he lay dying (and largely ignored by the dynasty he had served so assiduously) of brain cancer. (Sunset 5) (Ella Taylor) FIREPROOF When Capt. Caleb Holt (Kirk Cameron) decides to divorce his Sarah Palin-type wife his bros at the firehouse come to his rescue with words of wisdom swiped from the annals of Hallmark ""You never leave your partner especially during a fire."" With advice like this its no wonder Caleb turns to Jesus. Naturally director Alex Kendricks style suggests a pharmaceutical commercial -- especially during scenes of Caleb and his father plodding through the woods toward a creepily and strategically placed cross -- because what is Fireproof selling if not a drug? But before it even mentions God the film works sweetly as a chronicle of a man trying to extend the courage he shows on the job to his marriage by following a 40-day experiment called ""The Love Dare"" which necessitates being kind to Catherine (Erin Bethea) and ultimately unkind to himself -- by giving up his dream of owning a boat and beating the shit out of his computer for teasing him with a pornographic pop-up ad. Then the film gets all religulous suggesting that Calebs devotion to healing means nothing without Jesus and so Fireproof stops becoming relatable to us all and only to the already or easily indoctrinated. (Selected theaters) (Ed Gonzalez) FLASH OF GENIUS The big-screen version of inventor Robert Kearns legal battles with Ford and Chrysler -- both of whom nicked his intermittent windshield wiper without giving him credit much less paying a cent -- is about as exciting as Kearns Wikipedia entry. Greg Kinnear usually kinetic is unusually (and unbearably) dull in producer turned director Marc Abrahams telling of Kearns years-long fight to regain his good name even as Ford finally offers millions to get him to scram. Is Kearns mad or just angry? Hard to say as the filmmaker and actor cant get a handle on a man obsessed with windshield wipers and the attendant credit thats rightfully his. The movies so even-keeled that the cast -- including Lauren Graham as the tolerant wife who suddenly snaps and then just vanishes altogether -- seems to be getting sleepy sleepy sleepy as it winds its way toward a courtroom showdown thats more slowdown. You know how itll all end -- Hollywood doesnt make movies in which Goliath trounces David especially when hes Greg Kinnear -- so all youre left with are windshield wipers going back and forth ... and back and forth ... and back and forth. (Citywide) (Robert Wilonsky)  THE HOUSE OF ADAM Suspecting that hes being robbed the owner of a small-town diner asks his married son Anthony (John Shaw) to return from college to spy on his only employee Adam (Jared Cadwell). Within three minutes of screen time Anthony cuts himself in the kitchen Adam grinningly sticks the bloody finger in his mouth the two walk along babbling creeks together and Adam reveals -- as he has to nobody else -- that hes gay. Soon after Anthony cops to both the embezzlement and bi-curiosity his dying father entrusts his cabin to Adam and -- one year and a divorce later -- Anthony is Adams lover and a police detective. Then Adam is beaten to death with a Bible by beefcake religious fanatics enabling Anthony to move into the house -- now owned by another couple -- and find his beloveds remains. Jorge Ameers laughably unskilled drama (acting thats the opposite of natural confused music cues colors that dont match between each hideously framed shot production values rivaling late-night Cinemax softcore cheapies mildly supernatural events) is so poorly written and directed that it could be a fake movie within a John Waters camp classic. How else to explain such a waste of time escaping the LBGT-festival circuit? (Sunset 5) (Aaron Hillis) HOW TO LOSE FRIENDS AND ALIENATE PEOPLE Based on Toby Youngs tome about his spectacular fuck-ups and flame-out at Vanity Fair Robert Weides big-screen version is sitcom-drab. Simon Pegg plays Young reducing the writer -- in the book version a narcissistic twat who aspired to be Cary Grant in His Girl Friday sans the looks or talent -- to nothing more than a barely functioning idiot a cretin clad in a ""Young Dumb and Full of Come"" T-shirt whose loutishness is outmatched only by his inability to function as a human being. Worse the storys been turned into a romantic comedy in which Simon woos his considerably smarter though no less self-absorbed superior Alison Olsen (Kirsten Dunst) whos fucking an editor (Danny Huston) who seems to be speaking in four different accents at once none of them quite of the English variety. It plays like a made-for-CBS redo of The Devil Wears Prada which was likewise set at a Manhattan glossy but also happened to contain some genuinely insightful observations about the perils of workplace success. (Citywide) (Robert Wilonsky) MENTOR As aging novelist and graduate professor Sanford Pollard Rutger Hauer shares a vocation a shaggy gray haircut and a pair of tortoiseshell frames with the Michael Douglas character from Curtis Hansons Wonder Boys. Like Douglas Grady Tripp Pollard juggles relationships with his students carrying on a romantic liaison with the class assistant (Dagmara Dominczyk) while becoming guru to a talented young writer (Matt Davis). But whereas Douglass defining characteristic in Wonder Boys was his midlife fatigue Pollard is notable for his abusive mind games and penchants for cocaine and predatory sex. You didnt think they hired Rutger Hauer to play Mr. Chips did you? With Hauer as cruel ringmaster an erotic triangle develops and eventually it feels as if director David Carl Lang has welded the plot of Indecent Proposal onto Wonder Boys world of bourgeois academia. All the bedroom action apparently transforms Pollards young protege into a great novelist although Davis appears no less boyish and clueless at the end of the film than he does in the beginning. Lang tells us that hanging around someone like Pollard will turn you into a great writer but its hard to accept Hauer as anything other than a despicable prick. Mentor might have rung truer had it allowed Pollard to stay a monster rather than redeeming him in a predictably heartwarming climax. (Grande 4-Plex) (Sam Sweet) NICK amp; NORAHS INFINITE PLAYLIST Peter Solletts 2002 film Raising Victor Vargas remains among the most pointed poignant and joyful films about teen love ever made. Everything about it felt special from its depictions of the Lower East Side of Manhattan to its cast then-newcomers who seemed to radiate from within as they groped and coped beneath watchful eyes. Now Sollett can only retrace those footsteps in this far lesser movie about little more than a boy (Michael Cera once more in the Michael Cera role) a girl (Kat Dennings) and their friends cruising the streets of NYC in search of the latest greatest hippest band in all the land (a band we never see or hear incidentally which shorts the audience of at least one promised reward for making it to the movies end). From its indier-than-thou soundtrack -- larded with the likes of Vampire Weekend Bishop Allen and Band of Horses -- to its split-second hipster cameos (Devendra Banhart Seth Meyers John Cho Kevin Corrigan) this after-hours romantic comedy plays like the exact opposite of Victor Vargas Where that movie was organic with every scene hitting just the right note and feeling so magically accidental Nick amp; Norah is like something crafted in a lab by 54-year-old hucksters trying to sell shit to the kids under the cheerless guise of ""alternative."" The only thing its an alternative to? Good. (Citywide) (Robert Wilonsky)  GO  OBSCENE Barney Rosset is a tragic hero. He says so himself at the end of Obscene stating -- by way of a colleagues parting shot -- what the previous 90 minutes of Neil Ortenberg and Daniel OConnors very fine documentary make unstintingly and yet wistfully clear. Beginning with Rossets 1989 appearance on a delightfully vulgar cable-access show and a question about how he managed to lose his publishing imprint Grove Press in an unexpectedly hostile buyout Obscene then reels back some 50 years tracing the Chicago origins of a kid who grew up to fight perhaps the preeminent publishing battle of the 20th century censorship. Much of the film and photographic material is culled from Rossets stunningly replete archives and an assortment of artists publishers and literati appears to champion and chide the man who first brought Lady Chatterleys Lover Tropic of Cancer and Naked Lunch to the starving bosoms of the American public. Having sold off every acre of his prime Hamptons real estate in an attempt to keep Grove afloat through the 60s instead of jillionaire-hood and publishing-board eminency the 86-year-old today settles for the modest life of a cult figure with some kick left; his lit-and-naked-ladies journal The Evergreen Review now exists online. (Sunset 5) (Michelle Orange) SMOTHER Noah (Dax Shepard) just got fired faces pressure from his wife (Liv Tyler) to have a baby and must contend with her socially inept cousin (Mike White) who wants to stay with them for a few days while he finishes his screenplay. Thats when Marilyn (Diane Keaton) Noahs high-maintenance mother announces shes moving in turning Noahs bad day into a presumably hilarious and awful one. Directed and co-written by Vince Di Meglio Smother aspires to an edgy style of non-sequitur humor where the situations arent particularly funny or original but do allow enough room for throwaway jokes and bizarre running gags. The problem with this flimsy narrative approach is that the films laugh quotient depends entirely on whatever the cast can bring to the tired setup. In that regard Smother is fortunate -- Shepard is dependably low-key White goes a long way with his creepy-smile stare and Keaton demonstrates boundless charm when she isnt restrained by the cliches of her nagging needy character. Still with its mixture of high-profile talent and low-watt comic inspiration Smother feels like the sort of misbegotten curiosity Comedy Central uses to fill its Sunday afternoon programming. And considering how quietly Smothers distributor dumped it into theaters expect to see it there soon. (AMC Burbank; One Colorado; Fallbrook 7) (Tim Grierson) GO  STILL LIFE More than two years after winning the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival one year after a single local screening during UCLAs annual showcase of new Chinese cinema and nine months after opening commercially in New York director Jia Zhangkes Still Life finally receives a full weeks run at one Los Angeles cinema. Set and shot in Fengjie a real Chinese town that was being dismantled and demolished as Jia was filming in 2006 to make way for the massive Three Gorges hydroelectric-dam project Still Life is the story of two people in transit -- a rural coal miner (Han Sanming) in search of the ex-wife and teenage daughter he hasnt seen in a decade and a woman (played by Jias frequent muse the luminous Zhao Tao) looking for her estranged engineer husband. The two story lines parallel one another without ever intersecting each of them affording Jia and his ace cinematographer Yu Lik Wai (shooting once again in crisp high-definition video) to commemorate the disappearing Fengjie landscape -- and with it a few thousand years of Chinese history -- in all its decrepit gutted-out majesty. Everywhere Jia looks he sees the clash between Chinas past and its rapidly accelerating present Men in hazard uniforms with spray cans make their zombielike way through the ruins. A demolition team unearths artifacts dating from the Han dynasty. A gutted building literally blasts off into the stratosphere like a rocket ship to the moon. Ive said before in these pages that Jia (whose previous films include The World Unknown Pleasures and Platform) is the greatest Chinese filmmaker of his generation. In Still Life his great subject -- that of a nation making ""progress"" faster than its own people can keep up with it -- reaches its fullest and most painfully beautiful expression yet. Simply one of the best films of last year this year or any year likely to come. (Music Hall) (SF)THE VIOLENT KIND In its attempt to convey the psychological unraveling of a soldier returning home from Iraq The Violent Kind forgoes narrative structure in favor of hallucinatory malaise. The action revolves around a cabin in Montana where Iraq veteran Terry Malloy (Kirk Harris) reunites with his Vietnam vet father (Jon Savage of The Deer Hunter) and attractive young wife (Irina Bjorkland). The nondescript wilderness symbolizes the netherworld in which both father and son find themselves trapped but over the course of the film the pattern of surreal and grotesque images -- a carcass floating in gray stew; a musical performance by robed white-faced phantoms -- feels less like a haunting and more like mumbo jumbo. Director Geoffrey Pepos wants to show that posttraumatic stress causes combat veterans to destroy themselves and the people they love but he has little interest in unpacking his characters war experiences beyond cliches. Terry Malloy (the allusion to On the Waterfront is both cheap and irrelevant) talks in voice-over about his experiences with ""his boys"" back in the platoon (""You gotta believe in the guy next to you ..."") while Dad brandishes guns at imaginary ""gooks."" Both men exist only as war-movie figments set adrift in a picture that confuses a chaotic psyche with what is simply chaotic filmmaking.
