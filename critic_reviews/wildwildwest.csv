First with ""Independence Day"" in 1996 and then with ""Men in Black"" in 1997 Smith has delivered two early-July blockbusters. Once again all eyes are on the former ""Fresh Prince of Bel-Air."" Can he pull it off for a third time? Maybe not. Take an old TV show. Transfer it to the big screen with big-name stars and a budget of more than 100 million. Include lots of state-of-the-art whiz-bang special effects. Ignore any semblance of story development. Add hype. What do you get? Another brilliant original film from Hollywood? Nope you get a wild wild mess in ""Wild Wild West."" MULTIMEDIA Theatrical preview for ""Wild Wild West"" Windows Media 28K 80K Pauls Pix ""Wild Wild West"" Real 28K 80K Windows Media 28K 80K Like the original 1966-69 television show this feature film is set in the 1860s and is more or less ""James Bond meets Gunsmoke."" Will Smith plays special government agent James T. West; Kevin Kline plays his sidekick agent Artemis Gordon; and Salma Hayek as Rita Escobar is -- well her sole purpose is being the main chick with well-displayed cleavage. These characters mission as it was 30 years ago on TV is to save the United States from some hideous villain. In this case the bad guy is a gleeful Kenneth Branagh as Dr. Arliss Loveless -- legless (a Civil War injury) and a wee bit bitter about his wartime experience. Hes hatched an evil scheme to sell off most of the United States to rival governments and keep a huge chunk of the northwest territory to himself. His weapon of choice is a monstrous 80-foot-tall steam-driven mechanical tarantula the centerpiece of the films special effects. The result? A cautionary tale about boys and their toys and what happens when a star Will Smith and a director Barry Sonnenfeld are given way too much money to play with. Hollywood studios tend to open the candy store to anyone with a recent blockbuster on a resume. Its happened again. Men in boots There are some wonderful double-entendres here and there sprinkled among the otherwise boring dialogue. Unfortunately theres an equal amount of really dumb puns too. A few of the effects are slick and inventive and the production designs by Bo Welch -- who did ""Men in Black"" ""Batman Returns"" (1992) and ""Edward Scissorhands"" (1990) -- are dazzling. But ""Wild Wild West"" is a wasteful wasteful mess. There are no fewer than six people credited with the story and screenplay and theres never before been so much proof-positive that too many cooks can spoil the broth. It also doesnt help that Smith is smug throughout. Kline looks embarrassed much of the the time and theres no chemistry between the two actors. Hayek is reduced to being just decoration -- extremely attractive decoration but thats what decoration is all about. The only participant who appears to be having any fun in this uneven half-baked film is Branagh. His character is way over the top and captures the campy attitude that should have been present through the entire film. Like hot cakes Its a good bet that this film will open big -- Smiths name alongside that of director Sonnenfeld should guarantee that. But word-of-mouth may put this film into video stores soon. OK probably not but one can hope cant one? The hip-hop title song sung by Smith is a lot better than the film -- and a whole lot shorter too. ""Wild Wild West"" opened nationwide June 30 and is rated ""PG-13"" with a running time of 107 minutes.

Share Tweet In the tradition of such unwatchable blockbusters as Armageddon Con Air and Godzilla comes Wild Wild West yet another cinematic Spruce Goose that illustrates how bigger is rarely better. Less a film than an elaborate theme-park attraction gone horribly awry Wild Wild West stars Will Smith and Kevin Kline as Old West secret agents who in a rare and disconcertingly original plot twist are opposites forced to team up to fight a common enemy an over-the-top Kenneth Branagh as a renegade Confederate scientist. In yet another twist that no doubt required the brain power of all six credited screenwriters Branagh also just happens to be the man responsible for the death of Smiths parents. Big loud and gratingly unfunny Wild Wild West wastes the talents of a charismatic leading man (Smith) a gifted comedic actor (Kline) and a director with a unique gift for crafting subversively entertaining studio fare (Barry Sonnenfeld). That gift fails Sonnenfeld spectacularly here however as the deadpan comic tone that suited Men In Black so well falls horribly flat due to an awful script that tries desperately but fails to generate the least bit of suspense or laughter. Featuring some of the worst one-liners this side of The New Laugh-In--and some of the least funny bits of cross-dressing this side of a fraternity talent show--Wild Wild West is so flat and misguided that it ends up eerily resembling Hudson Hawk another loud boorish action-comedy that felt like a bad inside joke. Whether or not like Hawk it will become a synonym for Hollywood excess and awfulness remains to be seen but theres no denying that its exceedingly difficult to endure.

"Wild Wild West (PG-13) Related Item Go to Video Finder Smith Misfires in Wild Wild Mess By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July 2 1999 Kevin Kline and Will Smith team together in ""Wild Wild West."" (Warner Bros.) Director Barry Sonnenfeld Cast Will Smith; Kevin Kline; Kenneth Branagh; Salma Hayek; M. Emmet Walsh; Ted Levine Running Time 1 hour 47 minutes Contains bloodless shooting and explosions sexual double entendres and a couple shots of Salma Hayeks tush The best thing about ""Wild Wild West"" is the jaunty Stevie Wonder-sampling title tune by Will Smith and Im already sick of that. Besides the movie makes you wait an hour and 47 minutes before it even lets you hear it. ""Wild Wild Waste"" is more like it. Waste of time waste of money and colossal waste of talent. Lets face it - hordes of people are not going to rush out to a 19th-century costume drama even one with an 80-foot robot spider to see Kevin Kline Kenneth Branagh and Salma Hayek (although Ms. Hayek certainly is easy on the eyes). The real reason anyone wants to watch ""WWW"" is ""MiB."" Youre hoping against hope that pairing superstar Smith with his ""Men in Black"" director Barry Sonnenfeld will produce the same movie magic as their 1997 hit. You are wrong. Okay this film based on the 1960s TV comedy/sci-fi/western starring Robert Conrad does have some of the same ingredients as ""Men in Black."" As special government agent Jim West Smith gets to wear cool shades dress in black and shoot guns (albeit the 1869 version of Ray-Bans a cowboy outfit and a six-shooter). Instead of Tommy Lee Jones his quasi-adversarial sidekick is the wacky inventor Artemus Gordon (Kline) who keeps him supplied with ""Get Smart""-style secret weapons like a bayonet that pops out of his boot tip. In the special effects category West does battle not with aliens but with the evil mastermind and double amputee Dr. Arliss Loveless (Branagh) who plans to take over the United States with a giant flame-throwing hydraulic robot in the shape of a tarantula. Yeah I know it sounds terrific doesnt it? Unfortunately Smiths abundant charm is squandered by making him play second fiddle to a bunch of dumb machines that look like rejected maquettes from a ""Star Wars"" brainstorming session. Hes not asked to be much more than a cinematic Carol Merrill here looking glamorous while displaying a screen full of high-tech gadgets. In fairness though hes not the only one. Lovelesss henchwomen are also played by a quartet of wooden supermodels (Frederique Van Der Wal Bai Ling Musetta Vander and Sofia Eng). What Hayek is doing here Ive already forgotten. Oh yeah shes trying to rescue her scientist father from Loveless who has kidnapped the worlds brains to design his arachnoid kill-bot. What worked about the campy old television show was that despite its unbelievable gadgetry it still had one foot (all right maybe only a toe) firmly planted in historical reality. ""WWW"" is so far-fetched (a black secret agent in the racist deep South of the 1860s?) and implausibly futuristic (flying saw blades that act like heat-seeking missiles?) that it has to work twice as hard to make the fanciful premise work. Wests mission against Loveless is explained as a vendetta dating from the Civil War when the nefarious Louisianan slaughtered our heros parents in a settlement of freed slaves. As a child West of course managed to escape on foot to Utah where he was raised by wolves I mean Indians. Give it a rest. Either make the whole dang thing one big over-the-top cartoon (forgetting race and melodrama and feeble attempts at sense) or lose some of the bad puns (""No more Mr. Knife Guy"") stupid anachronisms like thong underwear and the expression ""butt-ugly"" and jokes about ""Air Gordon"" and wheelchair access. Wasnt ""The Avengers"" punishment enough?

With Will Smith Kevin Kline Kenneth Branagh Salma Hayek. Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld. At area theaters. Running time 107 minutes. Rated PG-13 Partial nudity sex jokes. 2 STARS Theres such a thing as overspending and the lavishly produced ""Wild Wild West"" is a prime example. The money showered on special effects and period detail leaks from every frame overwhelming a movie based on a sophisticated tongue-in-cheek TV series whose main appeal was its rough-hewn charm. At least they havent gone wrong in dragooning Will Smith to update this quasi-Western. Smith is total movie-star material with charisma to spare. He holds the screen against the onslaught of gadgetry and special effects as he plays government agent James West. West is handy with the ladies and when his hands are free with a six-shooter. Between romantic interludes he keeps order in the land on behalf of President Ulysses S. Grant. And he wears a really great vest. His latest assignment is an overcomplicated hodgepodge involving the rescue of kidnaped scientists and the halting of power-mad Dr. Arliss Loveless and his tarantula-shaped tank. Each plot development is cause for a new set of special effects and complicated contraptions. West is teamed with Artemus Gordon (Kevin Kline) a prissy inventor and master of disguise. (Kline in drag is a sight to behold.) In the original series these two were inseparable partners who lived together in a retrofitted choo-choo. The movie returns them to the rails but employs the stock buddy-movie device of a mismatched duo who must overcome their aversion to each other. The casting of an African-American as a sex symbol and authority figure in the Old West isnt completely color-blind. West is given a background story of being a runaway slave a concept too ponderous for this lighthearted romp. Theres a queasy feeling behind a scene in which West double-talks a redneck crowd out of lynching him. The story is a mishmash concocted by no fewer than six writers two of whom have credits that include ""Short Circuit 2"" and ""Ghost Dad."" The dialogue isnt very distinctive but the actors make the most of their delivery particularly Kenneth Branagh as Dr. Loveless a truncated bon-vivant villain who spews Southern-fried venom from his wheelchair. Even bad puns sound good when they are being Ping-Ponged between Branagh and Smith as they insult each other under a polite veneer. Those six writers couldnt come up with anything convincing for Salma Hayek to do aside from wearing the flap of her Dr. Dentons unbuttoned. The luscious Latina is on hand for sex appeal but her relationship with James and Artie remains almost adolescently chaste. Thanks to director Barry Sonnenfeld who did ""The Addams Family"" and that other Will Smith hit ""Men in Black"" ""Wild Wild West"" is visually clever and appropriately jokey. But the eyes glaze over after one too many admiring closeups of Dr. Loveless giant walking bug something that obviously cost a lot to concoct and animate. For maximum entertainment a movie cant afford to waste so much time being its own carnival barker relentlessly trying to drum up interest.

But he might just as well be wondering why he traded in Will Shakespeare for Will Smith. A Smith blockbuster is as much a Fourth of July tradition as parades barbecue picnics and patriotic speeches but Wild Wild West is a wet firecracker.Warner Bros. - which took a bath with last years biggest flop The Avengers - hoped to reverse the situation with its latest big-screen take on an old TV series. But while WWW isnt a calamity on the Avengers scale its way below the standard of Men in Black or even the gung-ho looniness of Independence Day.Anyone who expects to see Men in Chaps and the same brio Smith and Sonnenfeld brought to the comedy of alienation in MiB will be cruelly disappointed. Historically preposterous and scientifically anachronistic to a breathtaking degree WWW doesnt allow Smith and Kevin Kline the time or room to establish rapport between government agents James T. West and Artemus Gordon. The script exudes the staleness that comes from passing through too many word processors and the film plays as if many establishing scenes between the stars were on the cutting-room floor.Smith and Kline take refuge by disguising themselves as women at several key points - a perfect image for a film thats a disappointing drag. At least Branagh can tell his grandchildren that he was only half in WWW. As the Confederate arch villain Arliss Loveless he is missing from the waist down and gets around in a powered wheelchair.When not essaying a Southern accent that belongs in vaudeville Branagh does his second mad-scientist take in movies - the first being Frankenstein which he also directed. Still seething about Appomattox Loveless has been kidnapping the best brains in the country to help him create weapons of unheard-of power. With these he plans to make President Grant surrender the United States.Loveless catches up with Grant as the President is about to drive in the final spike of the transcontinental railroad at Promontory Point in Utah in 1869. When he makes his demand for the United States like a kid asking for the car keys Grant is understandably perplexed - as will be viewers trying to keep up with the random selection of scenes and explosions (mostly the latter) that precede this limp face-off.The 1960s TV series tried to keep its 007 gadgetry at least halfway plausibly in the 19th century. WWW is a wide-open Bond market and thinks nothing of having Gordon invent the airplane in a few hasty minutes.On paper matching the director of the two Addams Family outings Get Shorty and Men in Black with the lighthearted adventures of West and Gordon must have made sense. A reported 160 million later it makes no sense at all.WILD WILD WEST    Produced by Jon Peters and Barry Sonnenfeld; directed by Sonnenfeld; written by Brent Maddock Jeffrey Price Peter S.

"Summer of Sam Bursts With Trying to Be Important | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Style amp; Design Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Summer of Sam Bursts With Trying to Be Important By Andrew Sarris  07/12/99 1200am Spike Lees Summer of Sam  from a screenplay by Victor Colicchio Michael Imperioli and Mr. Lee has little to do with the serial murderer Son of Sam who finally turned out to be David Berkowitz a Yonkers mailman and even less with the police procedures in place during the hunt. In a cable interview with Delroy Lindo Mr. Lee said the original screenplay dealt entirely with a Bronx Italian-American community transformed into a lynch mob by all the media hysteria over Son of Sam. According to Mr. Lee he expanded the material by making it an epic of New York in 1977 complete with heat waves power failures Studio 54 Platos Retreat and the indefatigable journalistic mug-raker Jimmy Breslin to whom Mr. Berkowitz wrote a series of loony letters during the killing spree. The eminent Mr. Breslin a fellow alumnus of John Adams High School in Queens makes a cameo appearance in the film to establish the reality of Son of Sam for that large portion of the audience to whom 1977 is ancient history. To my knowledge Mr. Breslin has not clearly established whether he made up his own lines or had them written for him. He speaks of 1977 as if it were the Dark Ages next to prosperous and virtually crime-free New York in 1999. All I can say is that the summer of 1999 aint over yet the murder rate in New York is steadily rising again though the Mayor of New York hasnt called a press conference to announce this ominous development and there is another serial murderer on the rampage out in the hinterlands and on the front pages of New Yorks tabloids. The big question is why we need to resurrect the Son of Sam story 22 years later particularly after a recent high school massacre has made everyone more sensitive to violence in the media. Of course Mr. Lee had his movie in the pipeline before all the recent unpleasantness hit the fan. Still why did he highlight the murders with brightly orgasmic illumination and monster-shoes camera angles to conceal the face of the murderer as if his identity were a tantalizing mystery? This is trashy exploitation at its clumsiest. Once more a Spike Lee movie has been undone by the earnestness of being important. Not that his central two-couple plot with its Greek chorus of Italian-American crackheads knuckleheads and road-company mafiosi can stand on its own wobbly legs. For one thing the steady stream of four-letter-word invective makes the salty exchanges between Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci in Martin Scorseses Raging Bull (1980) sound like Jane Austen dialogue. Adrien Brody as the victimized Ritchie a spike-haired bisexual pseudo-British-punk-rock-accented guy from the neighborhood and Jennifer Esposito as his reformed sluttish girlfriend give the most sympathetic performances simply by not screaming and swearing at each other at every opportunity. The same cannot be said for the excruciatingly abusive scenes between John Leguizamo as the coke-sniffing super-stud-adulterer Vinny and Mira Sorvino as his long-suffering but eventually enraged nice Italian-American wife Dionna. After dragging Dionna to the infamous Platos Retreat and encouraging her to engage in the extracurricular entertainment he has the unmitigated gall to call her a whore and a dyke with all the machismo he can muster from his dope-befuddled brain. I hate to use the reverse racist card on the self-righteous Mr. Lee but if an Italian-American director caricatured and defamed African-American characters in Bed-Stuy as Mr. Lee demonizes Italian-Americans here wed never hear the end of it. In his much overrated Do the Right Thing (1989) Mr. Lees Bed-Stuy was miraculously free of the slightest whiff of marijuana much less any of the hard stuff that allegedly abounds in African-American neighborhoods. The reason I hate to bring this issue up is because until recently Hollywoods treatment of African-Americans was monstrously unfair and unjust and even now there is a certain squeamishness at play on the silver screen. Hence my strong reservations about Mr. Lee as an artist do not extend to the blanket denial of the virulent racism that still infects the Western world here and abroad. But as a critic I cannot deny the evidence of Mr. Lees pomposity and pretentiousness as a filmmaker and shrewd self-promoter. Theres Something About Masturbation Paul Weitz and Chris Weitzs American Pie  from a screenplay by Adam Herz has generated some favorable buzz on the preview circuit and I can understand why. Its modestly likable qualities would have consigned it to the commercial scrap heap reserved for sanely balanced fair-minded chucklesome comedies like Election . Mere chuckles wont make it with the targeted first-week audience of guffaw-seeking yahoos turned on by the promise of public urination in Big Daddy . Hence Messrs. Weitz and Herz were compelled by the laws of the current marketplace to disguise the essential decency and vulnerability of their characters with the prescribed assortment of outrageous embarrassments over masturbation excremental explosions urinary disorders premature ejaculations and a particularly sneaky Internet peep show. The faint of heart among my readers are forewarned and yet I found myself kindly disposed to the rueful skepticism in the movie toward the sexist preoccupation of teenage males with the jock-jerk ideal of ""scoring"" at all costs. That is to say American Pie somehow transcends its feeble contrivances by establishing an unusual parity of perception and consciousness with both sexes and that is harder to do than it looks. Nonetheless American Pie has been mystifyingly likened to Bob Clarks Porkys (1981) Amy Heckerlings Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982) and Peter and Bobby Farrellys Theres Something About Mary (1998) for the grossest and most superficial reasons though American Pie is closer to the trenchant feminism of Ridgemont High than the terminal piggishness of Porkys . As for the merry magical Mary of Cameron Diaz there is no comparable beacon of delectable female virtue in American Pie . Indeed there are no gods and goddesses of either sex in the world of the Weitz brothers. And the cast of the lesser-known performers adds to the aura of a tumbledown democracy at the senior prom. But dont expect any great moments of dramatic resolution in this subtly civilized contribution to the genre that will be with us into the next millennium. But at least movies like Election and American Pie suggest that even high school stories can be filmed with feeling and intelligence. Sex After High School Olivier Assayas Late August Early September is the kind of French movie (hee-hee) I can recommend only to hard-core intellectuals like me. Imagine This is a movie not only about people who read books but write and criticize them as well. Yet their lives are unusually messy and stormy and of course there is much sex and more than a little gourmet cooking as well. We are in Paris amid lives that are endlessly in transition between solvency and penury between success and failure between life and death. A new French actor named Mathieu Amalric dominates most of the scenes as Gabriel a kind of literary middleman who constitutes a one-man admiration society for an esoteric novelist named Adrien (Francois Cluzet) who may or may not be dying of a mysterious illness. Meanwhile Gabriel is changing apartments and girlfriends shifting from a stable relationship of intellectual equals with Jenny (Jeanne Balibar) to the younger and less challenging Anne (Virginie Ledoyen) who is more into kinky sex and emotional breakdowns than any placid life of the mind. Mr. Assayas who was somewhat overrated for the media-bashing Irma Vep (1997) may be underrated for the less facile and less gimmicky Late August Early September . He uses the hand-held camera a great deal but his wonderfully persuasive actors keep bailing him out when he seems to be thrashing about in an excessively expressionist manner. His characters virtually demand that you take them on their own terms and no one elses but they never become completely disconnected from any recognizable reality as is so often the case in the tortured films of Alan Rudolph. Late August Early September comes closer than any movie I can remember to capturing the nuances of relationships between overarticulate characters who cant figure out where they really stand with each other. This hell of uncertainty is a very special place for the discerning moviegoer to visit. Mr. Amalrics wondrously probing eyes are alone worth the prices of admission. Wild Wild Waste Barry Sonnenfelds Wild Wild West  from a screenplay by S.S. Wilson Brent Maddock Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman from a story by Jim Thomas and John Thomas is ironically based on a popular television series that was taken off the air in 1969 by a network responding to governmental outrage over violence in the media in the wake of the previous years political assassinations and youth riots over the Vietnam War. The more things change etc. Wild Wild West may be the silliest movie in a season of silly movies and is certainly one of the most expensive. Forget the body count and all the explosive devices. Forget all the coy visual and spoken suggestions or hidden agendas in the flurry of cross-dressing disguises. Forget that Salma Hayeks charms are completely wasted in a PG-13 part and Will Smith and Kevin Kline reduced to the kindergarten level of a buddy-buddy romance. Finally forget all the ruinously expensive special effects. Theyre not worth a minute of your time much less two hours of mind-boggling mediocrity.

Go `South Not `west - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Wild Wild Go `South Not `westMOVIE REVIEWTheres No Getting Jiggy With This `Wild Wild West Is A Colossal MessJune 30 1999|By Jay Boyar Sentinel Movie CriticEvery now and then somebody will write in to say that any movie I hate is sure to be one of his or her favorites.So it is with enormous pleasure - and an equal measure of mischief - that I recommend Wild Wild West to all such dissenting filmgoers.If you like what I dont youll just adore this one.Based on the popular TV show of the late-1960s this misguided production is much worse than Id feared - even after Id seen its uninspiring trailer. What Heavens Gate was to serious westerns Wild Wild West is to zany ones.The considerable talents of Will Smith and Kevin Kline are wasted on this vile vile mess in which they play special government agents in the late-1860s.Smith is Jim West who is good with his fists and gun. Kline is Artemus Gordon an ingenious gadgeteer.Gordon is also a master of disguise although not even he could hope to disguise how far from a masterpiece this movie is. The director is Barry Sonnenfeld whose misleadingly impressive resume includes Men in Black Get Shorty and The Addams Family.Sonnenfeld does get credit for casting a black actor like Smith in the role of the western hero that the white Robert Conrad created.The problem is that the script makes Wests race virtually his sole defining characteristic and that puts impossible limits on Smith. Even as the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air he could show more facets.As for Kline this supremely facile actor is actually made to play a scene disguised as a woman as if that would be some sort of challenge for him. To compound the travesty Smith later plays a scene in drag himself.The point of all of this by the way is for West and Gordon to prevent the evil legless Dr. Arliss Loveless (Kenneth Branagh or at least the top half of him) from kidnapping the president of the United States and destroying the country. Along for the ride is the beautiful Rita Escobar (Salma Hayek) whom the guys fight over.Actually West and Gordon bicker constantly and unamusingly. But the true low point is when West and Loveless trade quips.In what someone must have imagined to be a liberating politically incorrect exchange West pokes fun at Loveless for being physically challenged and Loveless mocks West for being black.Not that it matters while youre watching the movie but is this really the right image for promotional-partner Burger King?As the director of The Addams Family Sonnenfeld has demonstrated that he is capable of summoning up a delightfully perverse sense of humor. But this material doesnt lend itself to perversity - or at least not to as much of it as Sonnenfeld evidently thinks.Its as if the filmmaker had set out to deglamorize not only the old TV series but the western genre itself.As in that old series theres a lot of gadgetry here. But even in this area Sonnenfeld widely misses the mark.What was fun about the gizmos on the show was how small-scaled and plausible they seemed. You could imagine inspired 19th-century minds like those of Gordon and the villains whipping them up.But the film version goes way over the top to include among other follies an 80-foot mechanical tarantula. As long as youre going that far why not go all the way to Godzilla?Wild Wild West which opens today is this years Godzilla Avengers and Spice World all rolled into one. Its the disappointment of the summer the worst TV adaptation in recent memory and almost needless to say a fiasco of cosmic proportions.For those whose tastes are very different from mine I have only one wordEnjoy MORELottery results for Powerball Florida LottoLottery results for Powerball Florida LottoDo your homework before painting or sealing cool deckPuerto Rico birth certificates How to get a new oneLottery results for Powerball Florida LottoLottery results for Powerball Florida Lotto Related ArticlesTraumatic `Limbo Is Best For Mature TeensJuly 16 1999Lease Is Up For `Wild West Star BranaghNovember 8 1998Tvs Wild West Stars Have Gone To Greener PasturesAugust 22 1999A Wild Wild Quest For KevinJuly 2 1999Find More Stories AboutWild WildIndex by Keyword|Index by Date|Privacy Policy|Terms of ServicePlease note the green-lined linked article text has been applied commercially without any involvement from our newsroom editors reporters or any other editorial staff.,http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1999-06-30/lifestyle/9906290222_1_arliss-loveless-wild-wild-sonnenfeld,200,wildwildwest8,wildwildwest,orlandosentinel

Auburn Cinema 17 Bella Bottega Crossroads East Valley 13 Everett Mall 1-3 Factoria Galleria 11 Grand Cinemas Issaquah 9 Kent 6 Meridian 16 Metro Mountlake 9 Lewis amp; Clark Longston 14 Oak Tree SeaTac Cinemas Totem Lake Woodinville 12. Rated PG-13 for action violence sex references and innuendo. ------------------------------- This is how the ""Wild Wild West"" was lost. The film goes in with guns blazing (the budget-busting action movie opens today just in time for Will Smith Weekend July 4) but it falls short of victory. Even box-office heavies Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh cant save it. If youre looking for the clever action-fantasy director Barry Sonnenfeld created with ""Men in Black"" ""Wild Wild West"" will meet you only halfway. Rumors had already been circulating about chinks in the movies armor. According to the buzz Sonnenfeld had gone way over budget ringing in at 175 million and he was forced to reshoot and re-edit after screenings failed miserably with test audiences (he denies it all). And despite the continued success of big-screen remakes of retro TV shows fans of the 60s TV show ""The Wild Wild West"" belong to an older age bracket than the standard summer-blockbuster moviegoer. Set in the post-Civil War era the TV series revolved around a James Bond-in-chaps hero James West his tinkering sidekick and master of disguise Artemus Gordon and their battle against the evil Dr. Arliss Loveless. The movie borrows the series hokey names and cheesy ""Bonanza"" music and styles the opening credits after the original lithographic intro shots. Smith revives the role of Civil War hero West with black hat set at a permanently rakish tilt and Kline plays the parts of an uptight mechanically obsessed Gordon Gordon impersonating President Grant - and Grant himself. (It makes sense in the movie.) Together Klines Gordon and Smiths West have a week to stop Dr. Arliss Loveless a Confederate veteran (played by a zebra-goateed Branagh) who cant quite get over the fact that the South lost the war - a war that cost him a lung spleen legs reproductive organs and 25 feet of intestine to boot. His body - one of several slightly disturbing special effects - now ends on a plank and he moves about using a steam-powered wheelchair. Loveless fiendishly plans to take over the U.S. with his company of half-dressed Nordic saloon girls and a big mechanical tarantula built by kidnapped scientists. To save the country from the legless Loveless the good guys have Wests sharp-shooting wise-cracking wits and Gordons various inventions from spring-loaded traps to a flying bicycle. Smiths and Klines disparate comedic styles sometimes click sometimes miss. Smith seems overly concerned with playing it cool and once again applies his one-line sitcom delivery to the script. The ever-reliable Kline embraces his dorky outfits and garish prostitute drag with comic maturity. The two grab several laughs with the physical comedy scenes such as when they get collared with magnetic post-surgical dog collars and literally cant get away from each other. But during the odd serious moments that demand slightly more Smith doesnt quite achieve the depth he displayed in his long-forgotten role in ""Six Degrees of Separation."" Salma Hayek runs around in her skivvies for most of the movie. Its unclear what her vapid character Rita Escobar is supposed to do other than marvel at Wests superhero antics. In one scene that seems to have been illogically spliced it turns out Escobar is secretly in cahoots with Loveless but then she inexplicably reverts back to damsel in distress. Most of the fun comes from the special effects on Gordons gadget-loaded train the Wanderer and the 80-foot tarantula. For all its lightness though theres a slight edge to this film thats unusual in a Will Smith summer action flick. Smith adds a Steppin Fetchit to his routine he and Loveless lob African-American and disabled jokes at each other and theres plenty of sexual innuendo to go around including a scene with Smith and a woman cavorting naked in a water tower. Plenty of butt shots too of Hayek and Bai Ling who plays another tired version of the two-faced Asian seductress the Miss East to Mr. West. Loveless egomaniacal ravings quickly become tiresome and they go a little over the top. In one scene he commands a tank to mow down a troop of Confederate soldiers with machine-gun fire. No matter how evil the movie paints him though a fight between West and the knee-high Loveless still seems really unfair. Its just another element that makes this movie an uneven joy ride. It has its ups and downs but never makes it over the big climactic hill. It will probably make buckets of money but as this summers action movie ""Wild Wild West"" only gets mild.

Wednesday June 30 1999 at 12 a.m. By Manohla Dargis IN THE NEW FILM VERSION OF THE OLD TELEVISION series The Wild Wild West one of Americas biggest black stars stands next to a hangmans noose and jokes to a crowd of postbellum Southerners about how slavery wasnt such a big deal after all. The character a tough U.S. marshal named Jim West has taken a perilously wrong turn and just seconds into this would-be lynching its excruciatingly clear that hes not alone. The man doing this slavery standup is of course Will Smith the wildly popular star of Men in Black whose presence in this years edition of the July 4 event movie is its sole point of fascination as well as its folly. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - The time is 1869; the place is for the most part the Deep South; and Smith is playing a lawman a scant six years after the abolition of slavery. In the sane world this confluence of factors might create as they say a disconnect but not in Hollywood where rational thought is never as important as opening weekend. The original series characterized by an overabundance of gadgetry tepid innuendo and the sex appeal of its two leads was inspired by James Bond but built from cardboard; like a lot of mid-60s shows it had a hollow quality that neither time nor nostalgia can fill. Smith has the role that belonged to Robert Conrad a square-jawed type whose bland good looks were infinitely less interesting than the sly-puss stratagems of his co-star Ross Martin. Playing uncomfortably against Smith is Kevin Kline who has the Martin role of Artemus Gordon master of unconvincing disguises. For the record the films gadgetry is pricier but the leering is strictly the Playboy joke page circa 1967. The filmmakers realizing that Smith cant hide behind a rubber mask -- he is the movie its reason for being -- have opted to turn slavery into one of the movies running gags or at least an uneasy motif. Happily the burden of identity doesnt weigh heavily on Smiths character. This Jim West ran away from his slavers as a child and was raised by Indians which allows him to be black (and cool) and Indian (and cool) but without the attendant horror. The idea it seems is that when a contemporary black star -- especially one whose blackness no longer seems as important or relevant as his celebrity -- makes jokes about slavery or lynching its funny or at least worth some giggles. This is why when the white villain Dr. Loveless (Kenneth Branagh) calls Jim West a ""coon"" West can make fun of the fact that Loveless is in a wheelchair -- and not get strung up. Its an empowerment thing trash talking for the post-enlightened. Its hard to think of who could have made lynching funny. Lenny Bruce and Chris Rock are two names that guardedly come to mind though one comic lies dead and the other probably knows better. S.S. Wilson Brent Maddock Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman the writers credited with the script are four names that dont. One of the mysteries of the modern movie business is that who writes the script seems to be less important than who does the music or caters the shoot. The composer for Wild Wild West is Elmer Bernstein whos scored everything from The Man With the Golden Arm to The Grifters; the production designer is Bo Welch whose credits include A Little Princess; and the cinematographer is Michael Ballhaus who shot GoodFellas. Director Barry Sonnenfeld best known for Men in Black but best remembered for Get Shorty is a pop stylist with an elastic touch -- he has a gift for the cheerfully trivial. In other words the credits for Wild Wild West are mostly exemplary and yet the screenplay is swill. WILD WILD WEST | Directed by BARRY SONNENFELD | Written by S.S.

Untitled7 July 2 1999 At the Movies Wild Wild West By Bob Thomas Associated Press Writer With customary lack of originality movie studios in recent years have been resurrecting old TV series adding big names and monstrous budgets and hoping to make box-office bonanzas. Their efforts have sometimes succeeded (``The Fugitive ``Mission Impossible) often failed (``The Saint ``The Avengers). ``Wild Wild West falls somewhere in between. On CBS from 1965 to 1970 ``Wild Wild West was a quirky series that seemed to coast on the James Bond craze. James West (Robert Conrad) acting as an undercover agent for President U.S. Grant ferreted out and defeated eccentric villains seeking to take over the government - and sometimes the world. He was aided by another Secret Service agent Artemus Gordon (Ross Martin) a master of disguise. Salma Hayek as Rita Escobar. The basics remain but are ballooned out of proportion (and credibility) by the filmmakers. And what a big bunch they are two producers five executive producers four scriptwriters and two original story writers. James West (Will Smith) and Artemus Gordon (Kevin Kline) are deputized by President Grant to investigate a mysterious genius Dr. Arliss Loveless (Kenneth Branagh). He is plotting with former Confederates and foreign ambassadors to assassinate Grant and control the government. As in all buddy movies West and Gordon hate each other at first. But their mutual peril and need for each others skills force them to work together. The agents journeys take them to a roughhouse Southern saloon a New Orleans costume ball and finally the real West where they encounter Dr. Loveless instrument of conquest. He calls it The Tarantula. Eight huge steel-structured legs carry a command structure with cannons and other armaments. How the mad doctor and his kidnapped American scientists create the power for this monster in 1869 is unexplained. ``Wild Wild West follows the pattern of the immense hit ``Men in Black also directed by Barry Sonnenfeld two mismatched government agents battling against seemingly unbeatable odds. This time the nonstop action seems less engrossing. Smith is engaging in his usual wisecracking ``How-did-I-get-in-this-fix? character. Kline a great comic actor has more difficulty maintaining his character while slipping in and out of disguises. Branagh goes over the top and beyond as the insidious Dr. Loveless but thats what the role demands. Salma Hayek provides much needed female appeal - Kline is unconvincing in drag. ``Wild Wild West encountered tepid reactions in test screenings and the producers went back to the drawing board with retakes. The repair work doesnt seem to have helped. Too many elements remain unexplained and it cant really take four screenwriters to come up with this for Smith while hes battling five assassins ``Thats it No more Mr. Nice Guy. The Warner Bros. release was produced by Sonnenfeld and Jon Peters. Writers S.S. Wilson Brent Maddock Jeffrey Price Peter S. Seaman. Story by Jim Thomas and John Thomas.

Barry Sonnenfelds attempt to mine summer gold out of another teaming with Will Smith two years after ""Men in Black"" misses the bulls eye as entertainment and will do the same commercially. Warner Bros. should expect reasonably big opening figures based on the appeal of its star but a rapid decline will follow once the odor gets out. Some very talented people stub their collective toes quite elaborately and expensively in ""Wild Wild West."" Madly energetic in the service of a script thats just not there Barry Sonnenfelds attempt to mine summer gold out of another teaming with Will Smith two years after ""Men in Black"" misses the bulls eye as entertainment and will do the same commercially. Warner Bros. should expect reasonably big opening figures based on the appeal of its star who hasnt had a B.O. misfire yet but a rapid decline will follow once the odor gets out. Given the budget which may not quite rank with that of ""Titanic"" but is up there in the 160 million-180 million range with ""Waterworld"" pic will certainly produce Men in Red. As refittings of old TV shows go this was neither the best nor the worst from a conceptual p.o.v. turning the 1964-68 Robert Conrad-Ross Martin series into a Jules Verne-like 19th century quasi-sci-fier equipped with hip refs and contempo attitude. In the event however the major film it most resembles is Terry Gilliams ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen"" another fanciful adventure in which the bluster and gargantuan production values suffocated the whimsical stance arbitrary plotting and intermittent visual invention. The notions here are to make a futuristic romp from the perspective of the films setting in 1869 and to pit a black hero against a Southern white villain driven by revenge for the personal and political losses he suffered during the Civil War. Both are plausible starting points but the larky lightly irreverent tone established by Sonnenfeld and his platoon of screenwriters is neither serious enough for any true emotions to take hold nor nearly outrageous enough for wild surprising comedy to result. What comes to the fore in this vacuum then is what Hollywood feels most comfortable with these days -- thunderous cartoonish action (that required the services of no fewer than 114 stunt players) and special effects that enable the digital effects wizards to show off some new moves. Theres always something happening onscreen to keep the undemanding viewer stimulated in a very elementary sort of way but nothing that captures the imagination. In introductory sequences that emphasize nothing but sex humor and miss the mark in a way that accurately presages all whats to come special government agents James West (Smith) and Artemus Gordon (Kevin Kline) are defined respectively as a quick-on-the-draw man of action and an endlessly resourceful inventor with a special gift for disguise. With the action spinning from Louisiana to West Virginia and Washington D.C. (pics wittiest shot has West approaching a White House with grazing sheep adorning the front lawn) the temperamentally opposed lawmen are thrown together by President U.S. Grant (Kline again in one of his many getups) to thwart Confederate General ""Bloodbath"" McGrath (Ted Levine) who is allegedly developing a highly advanced ""weapons system"" that threatens the Union. When West and Gordon sneak into a masquerade ball in New Orleans however it becomes evident that their real foe is the insidious Dr. Arliss Loveless (Kenneth Branagh) a military genius long thought dead who here re-emerges as ""half a man"" a paraplegic mounted on a motorized cart and intent upon striking back at a world that has ravaged his country and his body. With McGraths help he has amassed an enormous store of weapons and in order to design his futuristic instruments of destruction has kidnapped all the top scientists in the country one of whom is supposedly the father of Rita Escobar (Salma Hayek) a beauteous saloon ""entertainer"" who tags along for the ride and keeps West and Gordon at odds over the prospect of her potential amorous favors. A significant degree of the production teams imagination has gone into inventing the gadgets and gizmos that outfit the special train car in which the threesome travels west. These include James Bond-like ejector seats and a pool table that turns upside down to position an unsuspecting victim inches above the tracks underneath the train. All of these stunts require a fast quip usually from West and when the next Bond film comes out and people complain about how lame the little ripostes are as they always do they will just have to think back to ""Wild Wild West"" to feel grateful for small favors. After a battle with Loveless tank train and some scampering through corn fields as West and Gordon are pursued by spinning discs that look like razor-edged Frisbees the agents quest ends in Spider Canyon (actually Monument Valley) where they discover that Loveless exploits in ""mechanology"" have given birth to the Tarantula a hulking heavily armed 80-foot iron spider that can plod across the countryside laying waste to everything in its path. Loveless aim is to kidnap the president and force the repartitioning of the United States into European-controlled colonies with much of the West reserved for him. Of course its up to the men of brawn and brain to stop him. The breezy quick-witted style that has made most of Sonnenfelds films to date entertaining and successful isnt enough to overcome the productions cumbersome mechanics or the unfocused and unpolished nature of the story and script. There are plenty of momentary distractions along the way -- the almost ""Addams Family""-ish ghoulishness of the dress ball the way figures from historical paintings come to life and climb off the canvas to interject themselves into a scene the view of a more technological future as imagined from the vantage point of Reconstruction the tremendous detail of Bo Welchs production design and Deborah L. Scotts costumes -- but they remain merely that distractions from the lack of fun and substance elsewhere. Smith seems to love posing and strutting around in his elegant cowboy duds but hes hardly at his most inspired or amusing here. The incongruity of a black man in Wests position of authority in the 1860s is brushed aside with gags and some of his bits including some mocking servile-style jive and a noose-point speech he delivers to an upper-class Southern lynch mob dont deliver the intended laughs and will make auds somewhat queasy. Kline has fun with his multitude of disguises and hits the right note of scrupulous eccentricity but also fights an uphill battle with undernourished dialogue. Done up in black hair and jagged beard and backed by an all-but-silent bevy of supermodel cohorts Branagh supplies all the vinegar he can to his Prussian-style villain while Hayek is all sauciness and pulchritude as the ever-elusive Rita. As impressive as the industrial-style special effects may be theyre both too much and not enough for this mild mild West.

Comments Wild Wild West I never saw The Wild Wild West a comic SF western series about two undercover agents working for President Grant that ran on TV from 1965 to 1970 but from the look of this sprightly spin-off it must have been pretty good. The director (Barry Sonnenfeld) and costar (Will Smith) of Men in Black join forces with Kevin Kline and half a dozen writers to yield an entertainingly offbeat blend of 19th-century science fiction and Hope and Crosby Road comedies (with Salma Hayek in the Dorothy Lamour part). The putative plot involves a mad scientist and Confederate sore loser reduced to an upper torso (Kenneth Branagh) whos contriving to take over the United States with the aid of an 80-foot mechanical tarantula. Though the movie is as gadget happy as any Bond flick the pictorial pleasures deriving from Bo Welchs production design and Michael Ballhauss cinematography are central to its charms. This is even lighter stuff than Men in Black but Sonnenfelds cheerful irreverence keeps it reasonable.

Starring Will Smith Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh. Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld. (PG-13. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The term ""Will Smith action comedy"" doesnt quite do ""Wild Wild West"" justice. Contraption comedy is more like it. Its the damnedest thing. Director Barry Sonnenfelds follow-up to ""Men in Black"" begins with Will Smith naked in a water tower and Kevin Kline in a brothel in a can-can dress and long red wig. Before its over they will have tamed a great galumphing iron erector set of a tarantula and ridden off into the sunset together. Smith and Kline sounds like a pharmaceutical company but here they team up for among many other things a sly variation on the buddy movie. Theyre two of the quickest comic actors around but the ace in the hole in ""Wild Wild West"" is Shakespearean Kenneth Branagh who may be the best actor in the movie from the waist up. Thats all thats left of him as the legless villain Loveless who whirls about on a steam-powered wheelchair which is just one of this films leaps into the surreal. This 100 million extravagantly imagined fantasy comes across as something like Sonnenfelds version of ""Brazil."" It may not have the mad world view of Terry Gilliams film but its a whole lot funnier. Its also a buddy movie that uses visual phallic puns to hint wickedly at what might have only crossed the minds of viewers of previous buddy movies spelling out the ambiguity of their relationship with a funny routine involving an overheard conversation about feeling each others breasts. The action is set in 1869. Kline is U.S. Marshal Artemus Gordon a master not only of disguise but of insane inventions too. Smith is the Wild West of the title the trigger- happy Jim West played by Robert Conrad in the television series which ran from 1965 to 1970. In this version West escaped from a pre- Civil War Southern plantation as a child and now works as an Army agent for the government that freed the slaves. Theres a lot of gallows humor in ""Wild Wild West."" Smith master of the insolent sneer is not above going into a mock shuffling routine if necessary before striking like a coiled snake. When West barely survives a lynching attempt he reminds himself ""Never drum on a white ladys breasts at a redneck dance."" COMIC INSULTS The diminutive villain Loveless of the TV series now has lost the lower half of his body which makes him literally loveless. He and West trade comic insults that go for the jugular. Branagh bristles with glinty-eyed fake Southern cheer. Not only is he bitter about the loss of his appendages but he is also an unreconstructed Southerner who has never forgiven the surrender at Appomattox. Loveless is not just whistling ""Dixie."" The villains steam-powered contraptions escalate progressing from the wheelchair to an armored vehicle used in a massacre and a steel-plated vessel that looks like either the Monitor or the Merrimac. The most amazing of all is the 80-foot-tall eight-legged ""tarantula"" that springs to life with a great clanking and whirring of gears. This iron contraption has an ungainly lumbering gait. It creaks and sways as one leg rises and others bend. On top of that it spits fireballs. Other surreal touches abound. Gordon is so preoccupied with his own mad-scientist cleverness at one point that it doesnt register with him that hes working with a decapitated head. Gener al ""Bloodbath"" McGrath (Ted Levine) has a creepy ear trumpet which results in the best visual pun in the movie. An amazing shootout occurs in a room filled with paintings of gunslingers. BUTCH AND SUNDANCE Another good routine involves Smith and Kline linked by ridiculous magnetic collars after they are chased through a field of corn by whirling blades. They take what amounts to a ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" memorial leap into a ravine. Sonnenfeld never was able to come up with a sequel to ""Men in Black."" Hes set up ""Wild Wild West"" for one just in case. Besides Loveless there are a couple of other cases of missing parts in ""Wild Wild West."" Somewhere before this big production hit the theaters at least one punch line seems to have been snipped off and there are other dangling parts. Kline is not the only actor who shows up here in drag. And as in most buddy movies the women are mostly decorative but Salma Hayek holds up her end of the bargain.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr WILD BUNCH ""West"" isnt best D+ Wild Wild West Genre Western Sci-fi and Fantasy; Starring Salma Hayek Kevin Kline Will Smith Kenneth Branagh Ted Levine M. Emmet Walsh; Director Barry Sonnenfeld; Author Brent Maddock Jeffrey Price Peter Seaman; Release Date Wide 06/30/1999; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted June 30 1999 -- 1200 AM EDT ""Wild Wild West"" is a movie that figures out how to go thud more often and in more decadently extravagant ways than just about any would-be blockbuster since ""Hudson Hawk."" In this noisy joyless bizarrely static fiasco every element on screen - the cliche Old West settings the computerized effects Will Smiths so-slick-theyre-Teflon smarty-pants quips - seems to let the air out of the one before it. The director is Barry Sonnenfeld who previously teamed with Will Smith on ""Men in Black"" and once again he has made a comedy that tries to be all things to all people theme park laff riot buddy movie creature-feature spectacle. But the aliens-among-us premise of ""Men in Black"" gave Sonnenfeld much more to play with. Even when the jokes fell flat (which to me was most of the time) you could always be diverted by extraterrestrials whose heads looked like exploding eggplants. ""Wild Wild West"" a loose takeoff on the popular 60s TV series would like to conjure a surreal collision of Western and sci-fi but the movie is straitjacketed by the stodgy overfamiliarity of its horses-and-holsters setting. I mean really is there anything left to parody about the West? The movie a piece of mutant six-gun japery seems to make up its rules as it goes along and the result is a series of stale misfired gags (Bruce Lee send-up anyone? How about Kevin Kline in drag?) set against incongruous 1869 frontier backdrops. The fusion of cheekiness and deliberately overscaled fantasy never jells. The core of ""Wild Wild West"" is Will Smiths blase fearlessness but the audience has little to do but sit back and chuckle at his ironic distance from situations that had no conviction to begin with. Of course his James West is also the films image of a stalwart black superman-cowboy and Smith is now so invulnerable in his ""street"" nonchalance that hes in danger of becoming an automaton of attitude. As Wests partner Artemus Gordon an inventor of Bondian gadgets Kevin Kline acts with full-tilt whimsy making him the ""feminine"" half of this buddy romance. At one point the two get stuck in magnetized collars and end up scurrying away from each other only to be pulled back into a forced embrace. Id say that the movie was trying to tell us something except that this brand of shtick which dates back to the Hope-Crosby road pictures and was kicked into a more precocious era with ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" now seems as ancient as vaudeville. West and Gordon like Butch and Sundance get to leap off a cliff only this time instead of yelling ""S--"" they land in a muddy lagoon that looks full of it. Thats a moment that upon replay could make an actor wish hed just stayed in his trailer. Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

"`Wild Turkey - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs MOVIE REVIEWS.`Wild TurkeyHow The `West Was Lost Overwrought UnderwrittenJune 30 1999|By Michael Wilmington Tribune Movie Critic.`Wild Wild West"" is a wild wanton and wasteful western farce thats so overblown and underwritten it almost makes you cringe to watch it. Sitting through this movie -- another crazily expensive superspectacle based on another dubious ""well-loved"" old TV series -- is often like trying to be entertained at an antique blimp race where huge multicolored dirigibles keep regularly crashing to earth.What are Will Smith Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh -- not to mention Salma Hayek -- doing in this lavish rib-nudging farrago? And what are director Barry Sonnenfeld (""Men in Black"") and Michael Ballhaus (""Goodfellas"") doing filming it? Surely nobody could have held out much hope for a script like this -- with its prat-falling drag jokes creepy-crawly robot monsters and mad scientists trying to kidnap President U.S. Grant as he drives the spike for the transcontinental railroad. Or did they?The movie strives to be gargantuan western camp and it does have a gorgeous overall look. But despite entertaining moments here and there ""Wild Wild West"" is a kind of blot on the escutcheons of some of the more talented actors and filmmakers in modern Hollywood.The source of course is the 60s TV series a spoof spy western that beginning in 1965 tried to pump James Bond movie tricks sex and gadgetry into the usual buddy-western plot lines. The series starred Bob Conrad as secret agent James T. West and Ross Martin as master-of-disguise sidekick Artemus Gordon. Those are the two roles played here by Smith and Kline and they arent bad -- which given the awfulness of most of the script amounts to a triumph over extreme provocation.But Hayek suffers as sultry love interest Rita Escobar. And Branagh and Ted Levine have been given a couple of dastardly villain parts -- Confederate madman Arliss Loveless and Gen. ""Bloodbath"" McGrath -- that make Warner Brothers cartoon rooster Foghorn Leghorn look like a miracle of subtlety by comparison.The script credits (or blames) six writers (including the teams responsible for the ""Short Circuit"" and ""Predator"" series). It begins by showing West and Gordon supposedly meeting for the first time -- in the Washington office of President Grant (also Kline). Then it sends them after madman Loveless bent like the TV bad guys before him on a ludicrous campaign of slaughter and world domination. The legless Loveless races around in a motorized wheelchair and is such a homicidal maniac he kills hundreds of his own men to test his new weaponry. Branagh plays this part with a slightly Bill Clintonish accent that makes you wonder if he didnt really want the Clinton part in ""Primary Colors"" opposite his ex-wife Emma Thompson.Assisting Loveless is the almost equally maniacal McGrath who sports a silly looking RCA gramophone horn over his amputated ear along with a bevy of murderous and mostly non-speaking lovelies (Bai Ling as Miss East Frederique Van Der Wal as Amazonia and Musetta Vander as Munitia). As in the TV show West and Gordon have lots of gadgets derringers and a luxury train at their disposal (including a pool table and the exploding billiard balls from the TV series). And they keep racing around the John Fordian desert on railroad tracks -- or later on in Loveless demonic invention an 80-foot-long robot tarantula that seems to have been inspired by the huge Walkers of ""The Empire Strikes Back.""Im no partisan of the original TV ""Wild Wild West"" which is based on a fairly silly idea and had a star Conrad whose forte was definitely not light comedy or droll innuendo. (Theres a campy edge to Conrads fashion-plate machismo but he almost completely lacks the delicious kidding style of James Garner in the comic western ""Maverick"" or for that matter of Sean Connery in the Bond movies.)But the original ""West"" was handsomely produced for a 60s TV western and it could provide mild pseudo-stylish diversion. This movie wallows in style drowns in it. Its so overdressed and over-produced that the barroom bordellos look like museums and the train looks like the Ritz Hotel. As for that new Hollywood staple deliberately tasteless humor ""West"" offers us numerous unfunny jokes about Loveless amputated legs Wests cockiness and Gordons fake bosoms before concocting a scene where the two heroes fall into what looks like a lake of manure.The tastelessness doesnt extend to the sex Conrads West was a sagebrush Casanova but Smith isnt given much beyond an opening romp in a water tower; and Hayeks Rita might best be described as ""All show and no go."" Its also a stretch to imagine the handsome and insolent Smith as a secret agent among a group of ex-Confederates especially since the script gives him almost nothing but snappy insults.1 | 2 | Next MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Life Skill 201 Washing a baseball capLongtime nursing home operators must face trial judge rules10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated Articles- With the new movie version of ""The Wild Wild West...June 6 1999When Looking For A Movie Idea Try Anywhere But TvJuly 17 1999Best Of The WorstJune 9 1999Cena wrestles with film careerMarch 27 2009Find More Stories AboutMadmanTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter",http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-06-30/features/9906300376_1_arliss-loveless-james-t-west-wild-west,200,wildwildwest23,wildwildwest,chicagotribune

Nothing goes right in this empty-headed extraordinarily dull and pointless exercise in throwing Warner Bros. money down a rat hole. Its a wild wild waste of time. The film is based on the 1960s television show which paired Robert Conrad and Ross Martin as secret-agent men snooping around cowboy country with Jules Verne-style gadgetry at their disposal. The movie version casts Smith as James West a gunslinging man of action and Kevin Kline as the eggheaded master of disguise Artemus Gordon. The year is 1869 and West teams with Gordon to stop evil ex-Confederate inventor Arliss Loveless (Kenneth Branagh) from taking over the U.S. government. They track Loveless and his associates through a whorehouse a New Orleans society ball and finally to his desert lair where they grapple with a lethal do-hickey that looks like a giant steam-driven spider. Along the way they get into various uninteresting scrapes and run into Salma Hayek whose role is so bland she appears to have been hired only as a bosom-delivery device. The screenplay has no rhythm arc rhyme or reason (the racial-justice angle is a gratuitous groaner). The action sequences are joyless lifeless and utterly perfunctory as if everyone involved were just fulfilling the terms of a contract they wish they hadnt signed. Cross-breeding sci-fi fantasy with an old-style Western worked on TV 30 years ago (the show was on for five seasons) but its hard to see the appeal now. The quirky gadgets might have been fun to discover if the trailer and TV commercials hadnt revealed most of them already. Still in the summer of ""The Phantom Menace"" the gears pulleys and frippery on display here look dorky. Strangely enough for a film marketed to children ""Wild Wild West"" has a lot of crude sexual innuendo including quick asides referencing a giant dildo and whorehouse bestiality. Maybe the filmmakers hope their stupid sex jokes will fly over childrens heads but not a few moms and dads will dread being asked to explain the whips handcuffs and leather gear over the pretty ladys bed. If NATO had dropped prints of this 160 million boondoggle on the Serbs Slobodan Milosevic would have have given up on the first day of the war.

Stephanie Zacharek Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies Entertainment News The problem with movies that are spectacles first and stories second isnt that theyre dull or tedious. Thats certainly not a charge you could level against the techno-fantasy western ""Wild Wild West."" Theres so much going on at every moment -- and so many glorious gadgets and sets including a luxuriously crackerjack private train for the heroes -- that the movie keeps you going on visual stimulation alone and that kind of pleasure should never get short shrift.Whats more the actors manage to maintain some presence -- almost miraculously -- in the midst of all those antic visuals. Will Smith still hasnt yet squeezed all the charm out of his ""Who me?"" line delivery and he looks damn fine in a waistcoat to boot. Kevin Kline is so intuitive and so intelligent that he wouldnt know how to throw away even the most poorly conceived role if you paid him. And Kenneth Branagh is deliciously evil and decadent a scoop of black caviar laced with laudanum.Somehow all that should add up to something more than it does. But ""Wild Wild West"" is one of those bummer summer hybrids a movie thats dazzling as you watch it and immediately unsatisfying afterward. You walk out with a vague sense that youve been entertained secure in the knowledge that lots of ingenuity and talent not to mention money have been dancing around in front of you for the past couple of hours -- like a mechanical road-show version of a hit Broadway musical but with flash and explosions instead of actual singers and dancers.The sense of having been entertained may not be the worst feeling in the world but its a poor substitute for the charged afterglow you feel at the end of a movie thats worked real entertainment voodoo on you. ""Wild Wild West"" director Barry Sonnenfelds ""Men in Black"" is a good example The goofy gags and impressive effects felt pleasurably casual and effortless and there was a deftness about the way they just about told the story by themselves.But ""Wild Wild West"" -- based on the 60s TV show most memorable (for me at least) for dreamboat dullard Robert Conrad and the bevy of glamorous temptresses that flocked around him from episode to episode -- tries much harder and succeeds less no matter how much of a spectacle it is.One of its stars is the Wanderer the fabulous train fitted with luxurious appointments (Oriental carpets tufted armchairs) and outlandish gadgets (a pool table that at the push of a button can entrap a victim with a few straps and flip him around to dangle over the tracks). Thats the vehicle that takes James West (Smith) and Artemus Gordon (Kline) two U.S. marshals who start out as adversaries and end up partners across the untamed territory of the United States in the late 1860s. Their mission is to thwart bitter evil mastermind (is there any other kind?) Dr. Arliss Loveless (Branagh) in his plan to kidnap the president and take over most of the country for himself with the help of a giant tarantula hes built somewhere out in the desert.But as with so many epics built on spectacle the narrative in ""Wild Wild West"" is so secondary that its practically submerged -- its a little technicality that surfaces here and there instead of the driving force of the movie. Not that the story is hard to follow. Theres not much to follow in the first place and whats there has been slapped down so carelessly that its clear its not supposed to matter much. But if a story is going to be that simple why cant it have cleaner edges? Its a shame that a movie that looks so good -- thanks to cinematographer Michael Ballhaus who captures a kind of cyber-western grandeur with color and light and the magnificent constructions of production designer Bo Welch (who also worked on ""Men in Black"" ""Batman Returns"" and ""Edward Scissorhands"") -- follows the logic of hapless finger painting when it comes to storytelling. You Might Also Like There are lines and small touches in ""Wild Wild West"" that do give it some style and the actors fill in the movies gaps admirably. Smith has a ridiculous piece of dialogue in which he has to talk himself out of a lynching for accidentally ""drumming"" on a white ladys ""boobies"" (this is 1869 America remember filtered partly through the lens of history but mostly through the Viewmaster of the summer blockbuster). Even though the scene is indefensibly silly Smith has the right cool stylized mannerisms to make it funny. Kevin Kline is as always a joy especially in the way he lets himself droop with comic lovesickness over Salma Hayek a virtuous lady disguised as a showgirl who hooks up with the two heroes.But when Kenneth Branagh is on-screen as a thwarted military genius and inventor deformed by one of his own experiments his cartoon deviousness puts the movie on an even slow simmer thats deeply pleasurable. His New Orleans mansion is a masterly blend of goth and kitsch all spiderweb stained-glass windows and Boucher rip-off oils of nudie cuties (""White folks ..."" Smith mutters when he gets a gander at all that gilt and pink flesh). Loveless surrounds himself with helpful buxom babes with names like Miss Lippenreider (who can read lips from a great distance) and Munitia (the munitions vixen). (Famous Victorias Secret model Frederique van der Wal plays Amazonia whos just well big and tall.) Branagh sits in the middle of all this lush chaos like a Southern gent/pasha with long ebony hair and mischievous devils beard. His speaking voice alone may be the movies single greatest delight his vowels like a smear of honey lazy and golden and nastily sensuous.And then theres the giant mechanical tarantula he rides in on who oddly enough is something of a dear charming in the way she steps creakily out into the desert landscape a multi-legged Frankenstein creature en pointe; shes both fearless-looking and a little tentative just like tarantulas in real life. Fascinating for a time but also ultimately forgettable shes the movies big shaky symbol -- a testament to the money and know-how that went into ""Wild Wild West"" but also a harbinger of its ultimate vacuousness. With legs like that a girl doesnt need a brain. But if she had one maybe she could really conquer the world. Stephanie Zacharek is a senior writer for Salon Arts amp; Entertainment.

"Can West and Gordon Solve This Caper? - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMovie Review Can West and Gordon Solve This Caper?Someone kidnapped the fun humor and story from Wild Wild West. And it wasnt the villainous Dr. Arliss Loveless.June 30 1999|KENNETH TURAN | TIMES FILM CRITIC Like the curious children they often resemble filmmakers can be fatally distracted by toys. Big expensive toys that are no doubt enormous fun to play with in person but dont register quite the same way on screen. Toys like the ones that dominate and finally destroy ""Wild Wild West.""Few things are potentially more dangerous to the health of a studio picture than giving a director and a star enough rope to hang themselves. With the hugely (and deservedly) successful ""Men in Black"" behind them Barry Sonnenfeld and Will Smith were granted carte blanche this time around not to mention a 100-million-plus budget considerably larger than what the entire four years of the 60s TV series everything is based on originally cost.The result is that ""Wild Wild West"" gets its proportions wrong. As clumsy and top-heavy as the 80-foot-high mechanical tarantula that is its prize special effect the film sacrifices playfulness and humor to concentrate on a relentless display of elaborate but ho-hum gadgets and gizmos. The subversive sense of fun thats marked almost all of Sonnenfelds work not to mention Smiths is just about buried under the output of obsessive inventors run amok.Television origins notwithstanding ""Wild Wild West"" plays more like a pinball machine than something made for a screen of any size. Its loud and busy with frequent explosions and brawls standing in for blinking lights and ringing bells. And not even the ministrations of six credited writers (story by Jim Thomas amp; John Thomas screenplay by S.S. Wilson amp; Brent Maddock and Jeffrey Price amp; Peter S. Seaman) can give it a story or dialogue worth paying more than sporadic attention to.That is especially unfortunate because in Smith as Capt. James West and Kevin Kline as Artemus Gordon ""Wild Wild West"" has co-stars who are capable of much better. Neither one however gets to play to his strength long enough to make a difference.While the TV show had West and Gordon as collaborating Secret Service agents the movie functions as kind of a prequel showing how the two men one in the U.S. Army and the other a U.S. Marshal came to work together.That idea originated with President Ulysses S. Grant (played here by Kline as well) understandably perturbed by a letter announcing hell be called upon to hand over the country to an unknown party in a week. Sensing a connection between the note and a run of disappearances of key American scientists Grant orders West and Gordon to collaborate in solving the mystery.Naturally these two prima donnas dont get along. West is Mr. Action described as someone who will ""shoot first shoot later shoot some more and when everyones dead ask a few questions."" Gordon by contrast is the cerebral type a believer in disguise and the kind of inventor who hides knives in the soles of peoples boots. ""I think"" West truly tells him ""you underestimate the convenience of a pocket.""Just because ""Wild Wild West"" is the disappointment it is doesnt mean you come out with anything against Smith. As innately likable an actor as todays Hollywood has he is simply not playing to his strength here concentrating on being steely and resilient when the film is dying on the vine for want of genuine humor. Similarly Kline a marvelous farceur has one or two amusing moments but is often called on to play things so blandly that he almost disappears from the screen.Joining this pair on the hunt is Rita Escobar (Salma Hayek) who wins the boys sympathy by telling them her father is one of the kidnapped scientists. A popular ingenue these days Hayek is capable enough in what may be an abbreviated role (a scene involving a horde of spiders that appeared prominently in reports from the set is not in the film) but her character is used mainly as an excuse for tired double-entendre jokes and peek-a-boo glimpses of her body.The trail to whats menacing the country leads through former Confederate Gen. ""Bloodbath"" McGrath (Ted Levine) to the evil genius himself Dr. Arliss Loveless an unrepentant son of the South who gave half his body to ""The Cause"" and now tools around in a kind of electric cart. As strenuously overplayed by Kenneth Branagh in an insufferable accent Loveless likes nothing better than to trade mild racial and disability insults with West. Its about as funny as it sounds.Like Wests partner Gordon Loveless is also a mad inventor (his inspirations look like they were constructed from a malevolent Erector set) and between the two of them they litter the screen with all manner of misbegotten inspirations. Fewer of these would have gone a much longer way but like a headstrong runaway train ""Wild Wide West"" is determined to hurtle down the wrong track full speed ahead. MPAA rating PG-13 for action violence sex references and innuendo.

"The Wild Wild West (PG-13) How the West Was Dumb By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Wednesday June 30 1998; Page C11 ""The Wild Wild West"" is a rambling wreck from computer tech and a helluva souvenir - that is for those interested in artifacts representing the American movie at its worst. As the French say quelle disappointment. Or as we say in this country this one goes bowwow The hopes were raised so high in the reteaming of director Barry Sonnenfeld with his witty edgy sense of black humor and star Will Smith with his fresh smoothness his natural grace and his immense likability. Their previous collaboration ""Men in Black"" of two years back was a consummate summer entertainment hip spectacular unusual clever and so textured with levels of humor that it could be enjoyed time and again. But whatever magic attended that one has been replaced with joyless tedium and superficiality unless youre in the mood to see a really big mechanical spider. It seems as if everybody associated with the project had a very bad day - month after month after month. The film as baby boomers will know - their collective memory being the true subject of most American moviemaking these days - is based on a famous and unbeloved series that ran on CBS in the backwash of the James Bond craze of the 1960s. Robert Conrad he of the cardboard profile and the monotone voice played humorless Secret Service agent James T. West. He wore a little bolero and really tight pants and lots of leather gear. I always thought he looked more like a tango champ than a cowboy. That aside the gimmick was that although the series was set in the eponymous wild wild West the plots looted conceits from the Bond pictures larger-than-life mad scientists bent on world domination using fantastic machines and amazing gizmos centuries ahead of their time; a bevy of beautiful dolls with goofy names. Of course it did this on a TV budget so the results were always underwhelming and co-star Ross Martins confabulations as Wests partner Artemus Gordon always turned on that that dreariest of all show biz artifices the disguise. You knew inevitably that the one ugly person in the show would turn out to be Artemus. This ""Wild Wild West"" re-creates all those things except this time its on an A-movie budget. So the bevy of beautiful babes is much bevvier (and more top-bevy than ever before) and the gizmos and gadgets freed by computer techniques from the requirement of actually existing in space are bigger and nuttier than ever before. The scientist is madder than ever though hes not larger than life hes smaller than life having been cut in half. Wheres the rest of him? Only the computer knows. And true to the original to the tiniest detail the heroes are even more cardboard than before. This is a movie with plenty of technology - you know steam-powered spiders jet-powered bicycles falsies with boxing gloves hidden in them - but no chemistry. The actors just stare sullenly at each other. Did they despise each other? Was there a whose-Winnebago-is-bigger thing going on? Does Kevin Kline have some sort of problem with Will Smith? Does he hate rap? Does he wish he were the bigger star not the comic sidekick? Why is Salma Hayek even here? She cant act and there are others who jiggle better no? The chemistry problem is major. What has characterized Sonnenfelds work despite its technical legerdemain has been his ability to get synced performances that lit each other up. Consider how brilliantly Smith and Tommy Lee Jones interacted on ""MIB"" or the ensemble playing in ""Get Shorty""; theres nothing of that pleasure here. Then theres the bevy issue The studio has been madly pushing three supermodels who appear as the villains cohorts in its advertising and various magazines willing to whore for Hollywood. But the three - Frederique van Der Wal Musetta Vander and Sofia Eng - are so inert they could be inflatable. They hardly register. The plot is piffle. A deranged Confederate sympathizer played by the upper half of Kenneth Branagh has been kidnapping scientists from the America of 1869 for nefarious purposes. West and Gordon are assigned to get to the bottom of it although its an immediate case of bicker-bicker-bicker. West is a man of immediate force whereas Gordon is a techno-freak given to oblique approaches to the problem behind a series of feints and jabs. They squabble a lot but almost never with any high style or amusement. The films one pleasure is Branagh who as Arliss Loveless seems to be playing a neurotic Tennessee Williams heroine under his weird beard and the computer magic that eliminates all of him from the navel down. His high shimmering operatic versions of the accents of the South should set regional cooperation back years. Only when hes on-screen does the thing have any energy at all. It seems that Branagh - think Captain Nemo of ground not submersible combat - has been assembling various infernal machines the most infernal of which is a cast-iron tarantula as big as the Ritz. This is a fairly impressive vehicle a clanking gear-spinning gizmo that lurches about the landscape on eight cantilevered limbs that look like theyd been built from struts out of the Brooklyn Bridge but are as prehensile as monkeys thumbs. But Sonnenfeld really doesnt get much out of it. We get to see it mulch some small wooden towns. Big deal. Why not turn it loose on the New York or Washington of 1869 since you dont have to actually build those things but can simply instruct a computer to do the heavy lifting. But no We just get to watch this thing spit fireballs into saloons. West and Gordon fight it with a flying bicycle. Yes this is what the Warner Bros. billions have bought a flying bicycle. Thats the problem with the entire movie Its big where it should be small and small where it should be big. And long where it should be short. And stupid where it should be smart. And its so dull it feels as if its running time should be measured with a calendar not a clock. ""The Wild Wild West"" (four days long at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for phony violence and mild decolletage.
