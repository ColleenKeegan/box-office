These big-screen versions give you the characters without the soul. Im tempted to say the same thing about The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle except that this time theres a luscious irony at work The zany popping media-age entertainment is the original cartoon series. The problem with the movie isnt that it sells out Rocky and Bullwinkle -- its that it cant keep up with them. Back in the 60s the Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoons were like Mad magazine for preteens smart and dumb at the same time full of delicious/excruciating puns (""Whats the matter? Havent you ever heard of...chicken catch a Tory?"") and a lickety-split absurdism directed at everything from Sputnik-era politics to the very show you were watching. A generation before The Simpsons or South Park these five-minute cartoons were madcap orgies of whiz-bang sub-referencing. Decades later their short-attention-span delirium can still give you a bubbly high. The movie on the other hand is as leaden as Howard the Duck. Rocky and Bullwinkle have to foil a plot launched by Fearless Leader (Robert De Niro) to zombify the world with brain-dead TV programming. Rene Russo does an uncanny impersonation of Natashas raspy hauteur and De Niro has some antic moments spitting out lines like ""We are the most terrifying villains in the history of childrens television"" But Jason Alexander is too cutesy for Boris Badenov; he just looks like a butterball in a black leather trenchcoat. In theory inserting our intrepid moose and squirrel into a live-action universe should work just fine except that Rocky and Bullwinkle arent allowed to take center stage. Theyve got to share the spotlight with a dopey young FBI agent (Piper Perabo) who appears to be on hand as a sop to 21st-century girl power. At least the heroes voices are intact Rocky with his oddly genderless sweet whine Bullwinkle with his stupido clarinet honk -- no one says more idiotic things with more quick-draw exuberance. But the decision to transform these two into glossy nearly sculpted figures who actually cast shadows turns out to be a major mistake. The essence of the series was its skewed paper-cutout flatness; it seemed to be funneling the entire world into a proudly 2-D cartoon. The movie gains a dimension but loses the world.

The sporadically funny and punny wordplay in this modestly amusing trifle might please baby boomers with fond memories of the early 60s TV show but even the stunt casting of Robert De Niro as the live-action version of a classic cartoon villain isnt likely to generate much want-to-see buzz among younger ticketbuyers. Expect a relatively brief theatrical run followed by longer and slightly more profitable exposure on VHS and DVD. The latest and least of three recent features based on vintage animated series produced by the late great Jay Ward ""The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle"" scarcely seems worth the expenditure of time money and talent. The sporadically funny and punny wordplay in this modestly amusing trifle might please baby boomers with fond memories of the early 60s TV show but even the stunt casting of Robert De Niro as the live-action version of a classic cartoon villain isnt likely to generate much want-to-see buzz among younger ticketbuyers. Expect a relatively brief theatrical run followed by longer and slightly more profitable exposure on VHS and DVD. Thin scripting by Kenneth Lonergan (""Analyze This"") and direction by Des McAnuff (""Cousin Bette"") make one appreciate how much effort and imagination went into the making of the sleeper hit ""George of the Jungle"" (or even the subsequent Ward-inspired pic ""Dudley Do-Right""). Obviously its not easy to stretch a three- or four-minute cartoon short to feature length. Just as obviously state-of-the-art special effects dont help very much when somewhere around the midway point a comedy begins to run out of gas. Maybe they should have figured out a way to outfit ""George"" and ""Dudley"" star Brendan Fraser with antlers or a bushy tail. For the benefit of those who tuned in late Rocky a dauntless flying squirrel and Bullwinkle a well-meaning but thick-witted moose are best buddies who cohabit in the tiny town of Frostbite Falls. During their first-run heyday in the Cold War era the two fought the good fight against enemy agents from Pottsylvania Boris and Natasha two inept and heavily accented bad guys and their short-fused Fearless Leader. As ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" begins the eponymous heroes are eking out a meager living on residuals from their long-ago TV show. But Fearless Leader is determined to make a comeback -- with of course a little help from Boris and Natasha. The cartoon villains contrive to transform themselves into flesh-and-blood entities by literally attaching themselves to a development deal signed by a midlevel Hollywood exec (Janeane Garofalo). Once in the ""real"" world Boris (Jason Alexander) Natasha (Rene Russo) and Fearless Leader (De Niro) launch a plan for world domination as showbiz moguls. Rocky and Bullwinkle are called out of retirement by FBI bigwig Cappy Von Trapment (Randy Quaid) to keep the bad guys from brainwashing Americans with a cable television network of mind-numbing sitcoms. (""Gee"" Bullwinkle notes as he views the insidious programs ""TV really hasnt changed all that much over the years."") Our heroes continue to be two-dimensional cartoons however even as they interact with three-dimensional humans. When someone makes the inevitable comparison to ""that Roger Rabbit movie"" Fearless Leader explodes ""Shut up This is totally different"" And it is though not for the better. For a good half-hour or so there is an attention-grabbing novelty value to the near-seamless mix of animated characters and human co-stars. Production designer Gavin Bocquet and art director Bill Rea enhance the interplay by striking a satisfying balance of realism and stylization especially when rendering the RBTV (Really Bad Television) headquarters of Fearless Leader. Unfortunately the gimmick isnt enough to support an entire feature and the filmmakers dont have many other tricks in their bag. The action grows increasingly fast and frenetic without becoming appreciably funnier. And the touches of tongue-in-cheeky sentimentality -- Agent Sympathy must get in touch with her inner child Rocky must believe in himself to be able to fly -- are too heavy-handed to get laughs. Worse Piper Perabos performance as Agent Sympathy is charmlessly bland. At its infrequent best ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" trades in the kind of sly self-referential humor that has made the TV reruns such cult-fave raves. Early on Bullwinkle patiently explains that he Rocky and Agent Sympathy cant take a jet from Hollywood to New York because ""this is a road movie."" Later Boris and Natasha are able to locate the good guys by snatching a scene-setting map from the unseen narrator (Keith Scott who also does the voice of Bullwinkle). Between the flashes of comic inspiration ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" kills time with swathes of narrative padding deliberately bad puns and cameo appearances by actors who are a little too eager to demonstrate they are good sports (though Jonathan Winters gets the most out of three thinly written bit parts). Alexander and Russo fail to convey or even closely resemble the Boris and Natasha of Wards cartoons. (Where oh where is Natashas trademark slinky black dress? Whats with the eggplant-purple attire? And why is she wearing eyeglasses?) But De Niro rises to the occasion and engages in some playful self-mockery while slicing the ham and chewing the scenery as Fearless Leader. Pic was produced by De Niros Tribeca Prods. indicating a strong personal interest if not starry-eyed nostalgia on the part of the much-revered actor. Hokie smokes June Foray who provided the voice of Rocky in the old TV show returns to speak for the flying squirrel in the little critters bigscreen debut. Its great to have her back even in a movie that unlike Rocky seldom manages to soar.

Starring Robert De Niro Rene Russo and Jason Alexander. Directed by Des McAnuff. Written by Kenneth Lonergan. (VHS and DVD. PG. 88 minutes.) In 1959 when animator Jay Ward created his landmark show ""Rocky and His Friends"" TV animation was mostly innocuous and dull. Ignoring the conventional wisdom that audiences couldnt handle verbal wit Ward created Rocky a flying squirrel who couldnt fly and Bullwinkle a lovable doofus of a moose. Now the Baby Boomer icons are back in ""The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle"" a droll fast-paced farce that combines animation with live action. Directed by Des McAnuff and written by Ken Lonergan ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" updates the zingy word play and punsterism of the original and adds a layer of inside Hollywood spoofery. Related Stories `Rocky and Bullwinkle Successfully Rescued / Scattershot comedy is true to originals style The movie opens in the present where Rocky and Bullwinkle are rescued from the oblivion of reruns moldy memories and ""ever-diminishing residual checks."" Their job stop Fearless Leader (Robert De Niro) who wants to lobotomize America with bad TV. Moose and Squirrel drive from Hollywood to New York accompanied by a naive FBI agent played by Piper Perabo. Their foils are Fearless Leaders despicable Russian henchmen Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale. Boris and Natasha are played by Jason Alexander and Rene Russo. Its tough to imagine better casting.
