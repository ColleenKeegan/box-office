Entertainment This New Movie May Be The Best Use Of 3D Ever Joseph Gordon-Levitts new tightrope walker biopic is the kind of movie that should be seen in theaters or not at all. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Joseph Gordon-Levitt in The Walk. Sony Pictures / CTMG ID 7016303 Its a joy to see a movie in the theater. Its an irreplaceable pleasure to lose yourself there in the dark to surrender your attention to something completely to become part of a fleeting community made up of you and everyone else in that room for the span of 100 minutes or so united in what youre viewing together. Seeing something projected on a big screen is great...but we watch films on screens of all sizes these days from mammoth HDTVs to (gulp) iPhones and honestly plenty of them arent any worse when theyre scaled down.Not The Walk though.The new movie directed by Robert Zemeckis (of the Back to the Future trilogy Forrest Gump and more recently Flight) and starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt as tightrope walker Philippe Petit is a kamikaze testament to the theatrical experience. There is no point to seeing it at home. Its best stretch when Petit finally steps out onto the wire he and his friends have illicitly strung between the two towers of the World Trade Center uses 3D and the field of vision-filling expanse of a theater (or an IMAX) screen in a way you actually feel in your viscera.It literally has the power to make the vertigo-prone vomit which is incontestable and endearingly gross proof of just how effective its recreation of dizzying heights is. Its a sequence that feels innovative and new in its filmmaking and its use of a technology thats otherwise mostly been thrown in to beef up ticket prices. Its a viewing experience that even with one of those 3D TVs that are failing to catch on you couldnt re-create at home. View this image > The Walk. Sony ID 7016325 And as if for maximum contrast the parts of The Walk that precede the actual walk in question are numbingly flat. Petit whose 1974 WTC stunt was previously chronicled in the Oscar-winning documentary Man on Wire is such a self-styled character -- a big boisterous personality -- that turning him into an actual movie character stymies Zemeckis and his co-writer Christopher Browne. Petits a man who carried out this one glorious dangerous ridiculous feat this sublime stunt and in committing itself to a biopic format that places Philippe in the torch of the Statue of Liberty to narrate and starts back at his childhood in France The Walk just emphasizes how unnecessary backstory is here.No one would ever ask for more Philippe. Hes a pixie with a Pepe Le Pew accent who likes to ride around on a unicycle while wearing a top hat and who speaks in pronouncements like ""People ask me Why do you risk death? For me this is life."" Philippe even insists on having a conversation with fellow busker and eventual girlfriend Annie (Charlotte Le Bon) in mime. As a role he highlights Gordon-Levitts most unfortunately theatrical tendencies his tendencies to strain to charm and entertain.Philippes forceful whimsy cant be separated from his petty tyranny in commanding his ""accomplices"" (played by Clement Sibony James Badge Dale and Ben Schwartz among others) to help him fulfill his dream of breaking into the Twin Towers before construction is finalized. He is like a lot of ambitious artists a narcissist who manages to convince others that his vision is also their vision though its of course just him out there risking his life on the wire for the spotlight.Man on Wire showed us that after Petit achieved his walk and after he was released by the police he went home not to the girlfriend whod been with him all the way but with a random woman who wanted to express her appreciation for his stunt by having sex with him. In the doc it felt like a tiny fall from grace the shift from this collaborative selfless act of daring to one of unapologetic vainglory. Its not a development that The Walk with its cuddlier Philippe includes but it still struggles to reconcile the fanciful purity of what the man wants to do with the calculated showmanship and the exacting demands on others that the act entailed -- and with for instance the moment Philippe seems ready to assault a stranger who might interfere with what hes about to do. View this image > The Walk. Sony ID 7016377 Its not that everything that happens in The Walk after Philippe finally gets to the rooftop makes up for everything that comes before but it does render it unnecessary. There on the roof as Philippe and his friends finish up their performance-prep-as-heist Zemeckis a director always interested in what advancing technology means for filmmaking gets to indulge in visuals that push 3D to some sweaty-palmed limits. If Gravity used 3D to emphasize the vertiginous centerlessness of orbit The Walk uses it to emphasize distance as well as the fact that there is some very solid ground below. When the camera moves over Philippe and shows us the ground yawning beneath his feet the sense of space it creates is astounding and the film teases out the details of Philippes walk finding 100-stories-up suspense in everything from a misplaced stabilizing bracket to a menacing seagull.Computer-generated imagery threatens to render us blase to the most elaborate of set pieces by making everything possible but The Walk turns what is a relatively straightforward act -- albeit a scarily placed one -- into something stunning by restoring a sense of physicality to whats happening onscreen. Gordon-Levitt wasnt really high above the earth but the movie puts us up there with majestic believability. Even a heavy-handed final nod to 9/11 after an entire film already serving as an ode to the Twin Towers cant ruin the high of Philippes walk. He may be precariously perched on his wire but in those moments he looks like the one with the world on a string.

Then the camera pulls back to reveal Petit balanced on the torch of the Statue of Liberty and the gentle magical realism immediately becomes absurd.Thats The Walks problem For most of its running time it cant do anything visually splendid without crossing into hokey territory. Theres no quiet poetic moment that isnt immediately followed by a loud clunky piece of comedy an overwrought monologue or a ridiculous display of technical prowess.Related Story The Twin Towers Most Memorable On-Screen Moments Still the movie almost gets away with it because it closes with its titular set-piece the famous wire-walk Petit performed between the two towers of the World Trade Center in 1974. Its director Robert Zemeckis has of late become intently focused on the limits of CGI and how they can impact storytelling on film making motion-capture animated films like The Polar Express and A Christmas Carol. All of that technological mastery is on display in the films final 30 minutes best seen on the biggest screen possible. But whether you can enjoy the stodgy and formulaic lead-up to that bravura stunt depends on your tolerance for bad accents and worse dialogue.As anyone who saw the Oscar-winning 2008 documentary Man on Wire would know Petit is at heart a showman a thrilling daredevil and caddish clown and The Walk tries to imitate his spirit from minute one. Gordon-Levitt an actor capable of tremendous brooding subtlety in films like Brick and Mysterious Skin is fully extroverted here almost acting as if hes hosting an episode of Saturday Night Live. Hes resplendent in a goofy wig jarring blue contact lenses and a heroically silly French accent (a fluent French speaker he sounds great when speaking the language but far less so in English).The film tries its best to match Gordon-Levitts carnival-barker performance but theres a fine line between charming and strained and The Walk doesnt have enough plot to breeze past every ridiculous affectation. Paris is photographed in chintzy black and white as if viewers were watching newsreel of the Bohemian turn of the century and its a wonder every character isnt costumed in berets striped shirts and rings of garlic so unsubtle is the rest of the imagery. That tone persists when the film shifts to mid-70s New York where every Brooklyn-accented cop looks and acts like hes on the prowl for the Sharks and the Jets.Theres an obvious motivation for this kind of pastiche In personality and actions Petit is hardly a subtle person so why not rise to that? But until he gets on that high-wire there isnt much for Petit and his gang of misfits--including his girlfriend Annie (Charlotte Le Bon) and photographer buddy Jean-Louis (Clement Sibony)--to do. We see the restless Petit learn the circus trade at a young age from a domineering carnival owner Papa Rudy (Ben Kingsley sporting an implacable accent of his own concoction) and then quickly resolving to complete the ""coup"" atop the Twin Towers once he sees an article about their construction in a magazine.The Walk undeniably exists for its climax one stunt it does manage to pull off flawlessly.The narrative bulk of the film is Petits meticulous planning and spy-work inside the Towers building a case for a task the audience already knows he will accomplish. To embellish this Zemeckis shows just what his camera can do combined with state-of-the-art CGI sweeping up and down the 115 stories of the World Trade Center with ease and showing off the surrounding views rendered in immaculate period detail. For anyone made queasy by heights these are the moments that are easily the most dizzying. Once Petit is on his wire and ready to put on a show The Walk finally settles down pulls back on the plot and character stereotypes and lets its images speak for themselves.From a dramatic perspective the most notable thing about Petits wire-walk was that it was relatively crisis-free and the film is happily faithful to that fact. Zemeckis allows himself a couple of wobbly moments (will a specific cinder block break?) but mostly understands that the very sight of Petit between those towers is engrossing enough without any further tension. Once everyone has stopped talking and The Walks technical wizards (along with Gordon-Levitt who really did perform on a wire though not 1350 feet in the air) do their work the film finds the grace its been seeking all along and its self-serving narration finally feels necessary to the show rather than thuddingly obvious.As a piece of storytelling The Walk has nothing on its documentary forebear tripping over its lame attempts at humor and suspense too many times. But as something to see--akin to say a trip to the Planetarium or a 20-minute IMAX movie--its set-piece cannot be ignored. Zemeckiss failing is his inattention to every other detail but The Walk undeniably exists for its climax one stunt it does manage to pull off flawlessly.

Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip.

"Walk The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; walk-the ) Walk The (United States 2015) October 04 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli During its short lifespan the original World Trade Center hosted a number of strange and surreal occurrences but perhaps none was more astonishing than the tightwire walk by Frenchman Philippe Petit. The event took place during the morning of August 7 1974 and lasted 45 minutes with Petit risking life and limb 1370 feet up to traverse a 200-foot long cable bridging the span between the Twin Towers. For this feat Petit had no net and wore no harness. He trusted in his instincts and training and they served him well. Director Robert Zemeckis has done an impressive job of recreating Petits walk illustrating that the challenge was as much mental as physical and using atypical camera angles and seamless digital effects to give the audience a taste of what it was like to be on the edge of the void 41 years ago. The Walk is divided into three clearly delineated segments. The first (and unfortunately longest) provides a biographical sketch of Philippe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) prior to his headlining stunt. We learn a little of his background and see him meet important people like master wire walker Papa Rudy (Ben Kingsley) and Annie (Charlotte Le Bon) who would become his confederate co-conspirator and lover. Zemeckis and fellow screenwriter Christopher Browne condense (and elide) real-life events and compress time frames. This part of the film which comprises nearly half the running time is bland and unremarkable. Outside of Philippe none of the characters have depth or discernable personalities and even Philippe is in part comprised of cliches. Although theres no doubt that some setup is necessary Zemeckis is unable to imbue the first hour of his film with anything close to what emerges during the second hour. Act Two chronicles Philippes preparation for The Walk and plays like a heist film. In this case however its more about smuggling things and people into a semi-secure location than spiriting them out. The undertaking is not insignificant the cables alone weigh in excess of 450 pounds and there is a lot of auxiliary equipment that has to be brought to the roof. Phillippe has three active helpers (including one whos afraid of heights) and several passive ones. The third (and shortest) segment of The Walk is The Walk. Although Zemeckis doesnt hurry this portion of the movie it doesnt play out in real time. (It takes about 20 minutes instead of the full 45.) Theres a surprising amount of tension for an event whose outcome is well-documented and this ability to wring suspense from a chunk of established history is proof of the filmmakers aptitude. Whatever flaws The Walk exhibits in the early-going are more than counterbalanced during the second half. Those fascinated by Philippes story are recommended to watch James Marshs 2008 documentary Man on Wire which offers a non-condensed factual representation of the daredevils life up to and including The Walk. For those more interested in the sheer spectacle of the event of catching an echo of the experience The Walk is the better option. Theres a parallel here to Everest. The 1998 documentary of the 1996 disaster has a stronger narrative component but is unable to equal the visual and visceral impact of the 2015 feature film.  Similar comments can be made about Man on Wire and The Walk. Despite having been in lower Manhattan countless times in the 1990s I never visited the top of the Twin Towers. But on many occasions I stood at the base of one of the monoliths and looked up; one of Zemeckis shots captures that view and reminds us that its possible to get vertigo when gazing skyward. For 27 years the World Trade Center was viewed as implacable and impervious - even the detonation of a bomb in its guts did no lasting harm. This is the image Zemeckis recreates. His Twin Towers are as tangible as the real ones were. Not since King Kong have the buildings received this much screen time and when John Guillerman rolled cameras in 1975-76 he wasnt forced to rely on computer-generated reconstructions. Those with an extreme fear of heights might want to bypass The Walk. Zemeckis cameras untethered as a result of superior CGI are allowed to swoop and soar. We are told that wire walkers are advised never to look down but the precept doesnt hold for the audience. We proceed with Philippe to the edge and are given a panoramic perspective of his situation. Later the camera dives precipitously plummeting earthward between the towers to give us a closer view of the spectators. Does the 3D help? Almost certainly although the instability of IMAXs linear polarization (which is prone to causing double images for background items) is at times distracting. A big screen however is mandatory. The Walk is another in a growing number of films that will have a muted impact in an average home theater and isnt worth seeing on a tablet or phone. There are no acting Oscar nominations waiting in the wings for The Walk. Joseph Gordon-Levitt does a solid job portraying Philippe but even in his best moments he plays second fiddle to the Twin Towers and Zemeckis wizardry. The Walk deserves a boatload of technical awards - its a triumph of special effects and should be recognized as such.

By Peter Rainer Film critic September 29 2015 Save for later Saved The Walk stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Courtesy of Sony Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Its a cliche that movies can transport you to places youve never been and never will be but Robert Zemeckiss ""The Walk"" at least for its final 40 minutes or so really delivers on that premise. What comes before in the movie however takes you to places youve visited literally and figuratively too many times in too many mediocre movies.The ""walk"" in the films title refers to the 1974 aerial feat where 24-year-old Philippe Petit played in the movie by Joseph Gordon-Levitt walked back and forth across a cable strung between the twin towers of the World Trade Center. The who what when where of this particular act of bravery or madness (take your pick) were well delineated in James Marshs 2008 documentary ""Man on Wire"" - which I saw at the Sundance Film Festival after which Petit bounded onstage and no joke tripped.By contrast Zemeckiss film co-scripted by Christopher Browne from Petits memoir ""To Reach the Clouds"" doesnt do an especially good job of examining Petits monomaniacal desire to be a high-wire walker. Were given the usual movie tropes shots of the rapt young Philippe watching a circus act or later on juggling and wire-walking for spare change on the Left Bank etc. The progression of his skills aided by a paternal circus mentor (Ben Kingsley in a role that embellishes the true story) is not excitingly or even convincingly displayed. Recommended The 50 best movies of all time He seems to go from bumbler to master in record time as he makes headlines walking the high wire between the two towers of Notre Dame. Then moving to New York with his twinkly girlfriend (Charlotte Le Bon) and a team of accomplices he sets his sights on the almost-completed World Trade Center. (Zemeckis downplays the 9/11 portents.) Up to this point the film has a jaunty inauthenticity. Gordon-Levitt is a sprightly performer with a balletic grace but he is required to narrate an undue share of his lines directly to the audience starting at the beginning where the camera pulls back to reveal him perched atop the Statue of Liberty no less. Even worse his accent makes him sound like Pepe Le Pew. The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide The high-octane narcissism that would propel Petit literally into the stratosphere is soft-pedaled. He just seems like a harmless obsessive. More than that the film buys into the line that he is an ""artist."" But there is no attempt here to separate out the performance art from flat-out lunacy. If Petit had failed in his attempt to walk the wire across the twin towers and perhaps killed accomplices or pedestrians along with him all this talk of artistry might have had a distinctly different cast.But of course as the world knows he did succeed and even got off without doing jail time. The walk itself is the films central and only real achievement but its a doozy. Zemeckis puts us right up there with Petit as he stealthily methodically makes his way back and forth across the wire strung 100 stories high. We are even afforded dubious multiple opportunities to look down at the city from Petits perch a luxury Petit himself for the most part avoided.Despite its nail-biting aspects there is an almost becalmed atmosphere to this sequence. (The attendees at my screening who reportedly ducked into the rest rooms during the more vertiginous moments may disagree.) Like Petit you never want it to end. You want to remain with him suspended in midair. This dreamlike feeling could only be achieved I think because we know it all came out all right.I wish the film had done more - anything - to analyze Petits psyche. But he barely exists in the movie except as a certified daredevil. When in a quick blip of a scene he breaks up with his supportive girlfriend at the end it comes out of nowhere and just points up the fact that we really know nothing about this guy except that as one cop says hes ""got guts.""The film left me with a tantalizingly unanswered question If Petit could only achieve bliss through acts of almost unimaginable daring what must life be like for him now? It would have been far less ""cinematic"" but a movie about the transition of Petit into senior citizenship would have been a doozy too. Grade B- (Rated PG for thematic elements involving perilous situations and for some nudity language brief drug references and smoking.)

"Kook Skywalker The Walk Takes Viewers Through the Wire << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Kook Skywalker The Walk Takes Viewers Through the Wire TriStar Pictures Movies October 1 2015 by Alex Pappademas Facebook Twitter Print In Robert Zemeckiss The Walk a shaggy Dumb amp; Dumber wig blocks most of Joseph Gordon-Levitts distinctive forehead and all of his access to irony. As the French aerialist Philippe Petit who wire-walked across the 140-foot gap between the Twin Towers of the not-yet-completed World Trade Center one morning in August 1974 Gordon-Levitt gives a remarkable physical performance. He also slings more ham and cheese than a fleet of croque monsieur trucks. He juggles rides a unicycle wears a lot of black turtlenecks produces top hats out of thin air and gum balls out of childrens ears woos his folk-singing love interest Annie (Charlotte Le Bon) using glass-box pantomime and narrates his own biopic in a cloying Ah ze Eiffel Towair accent straight out of The AristoCats. He makes Johnny Depp in Benny amp; Joon look like Johnny Depp in Black Mass. He is how do you say le worst and if youre anything like me you will actively wish to be rid of him right up until he steps off the roof of the South Tower and onto a thin steel cable at which time youll begin praying for his health and safety even if you already know how the story ends. For at least the duration of the 25-minute wire sequence The Walk is a breathless exhilarating moviegoing experience. Its just not much of a movie. In James Marshs Oscar-winning 2008 documentary Man on Wire the real Petit came off like a hyperactive cross between Michel Gondry and Johnny Rotten and the contagiousness of his intensity was self-explanatory. The documentary doesnt mention the 9/11 attacks at all but its deliberate omission of those events still felt like a response to them. By paralleling the World Trade Centers early ""life"" with Petits and positing the walk as a defining moment for both of them Marsh ascribes to a temporal artistic gesture the same lasting power as an irrevocable act of mass destruction. Its as if by walking that wire Petit stepped out of time to rebuke the primacy of an event that hadnt happened yet and by extension the notion that history can be written only in blood. Zemeckiss film lands on the same notion but cant resist winking at it in dialogue. ""Perhaps you brought them to life gave them a soul"" someone suggests to Petit as they look up at the Twin Towers after the fact. By that point Id started to wonder if The Walk was secretly their biopic contriving a happy ending for its subject by knowing when to look away. It shows us a dark falling shape turning out to be some insane Frenchmans lost sweater and people looking to the sky in delight and says Never forget.  TriStar Pictures Charlotte Le Bon and Joseph Gordon-Levitt Zemeckis has streamlined Petits biography so all thats left is a mythic tale about an artist with a crazy dream. He spends more time on the mans early life than Marsh did but you can feel his nervousness about the parts of this story that dont take place in midair. The first act unfolds in slow motion fast motion CGI-Botoxed Big Fish flashbacks and black-and-white with fairy-tale dabs of color. Clown-fear trigger warning Petit trips and falls and comes up juggling. Zemeckis is afraid well get bored which is not an irrational fear -- the superhero-origin scenes involving the irascible high-wire artist Papa Rudy (Ben Kingsley) showing Petit the (literal) ropes are brief but not brief enough. Papa Rudy forces Petit to rehearse the body-language flourishes by which wire walkers give ""an order to the audience to pay attention""; Zemeckis accomplishes something similar during these scenes by using 3-D to fling the occasional loose prop directly at our eyeholes every so often. In his apprenticeship phase Petit courts Annie and bonds with his first accomplice photographer Jean-Louis (Clement Sibony). Their exchange of platitudes -- ""All artists are anarchists dont you agree?"" -- is the closest thing the movie offers to a philosophical motivation for whats to come. There is no why Petit will tell reporters later on and Zemeckis mostly takes him at his word. Petit turns out to be a perfect Hollywood-biopic protagonist in that he appears to make all of his major life choices based on the kind of conveniently timed omens that invariably show up to divert peoples lives in movies like this one. Paging through a magazine in a dentists-office waiting room he sees a picture of the World Trade Center. Its a sign When he encounters the Towers in person and realizes theyre both as smooth-skinned as a Terminator and taller than they look in photographs he despairs briefly wondering how hell pull off the stunt hes taken to calling ""le coup"" -- until a painter emerges from the stairwell mutters a Howyadoin and leaves open a door that Petit can easily slip through to begin exploring the building. Its a sign You can feel the movie breathe a sigh of relief once it lands in Manhattan. Zemeckis cranks the on-the-nose oldies -- this time its Sly and the Family Stones ""I Want to Take You Higher"" as metatextual an elbow in the ribs as ""Feelin Alright"" was for Denzels coke-snorting scenes in Flight -- and the story eases onto a traditional heist-movie track albeit one where the only thing Petit plans to steal is the citys heart. But first hes got to case the joint -- 14 years after 9/11 we are apparently ready as a society for a montage in which foreign spies suss out the security flaws of the World Trade Center while jazzy caper music plays -- and enlist more coconspirators. His Stateside crew includes James Badge Dale as a wisecracking electronics expert and Steve Valentine as New York State Insurance Department researcher and deus ex mustachio N. Barry Greenhouse who happens to have an office on the 82nd floor of Tower 2. (Its a sign) This is a comfortably cliched vision of old New York -- the cocky boisterous city of Tootsie and Ghostbusters and the first Superman the kind of place where a customs agent upon being told precisely what Petit plans to do with his suitcase full of ropes and pulleys snorts ""Good luck"" and waves him through. Its also a metropolis where you could apparently throw a rock in 1974 and hit someone eager to help a strange Frenchman risk life limb and imprisonment in the name of high-wire performance art. Its a fun stretch of the film and the ease with which Petit recruits his Stateside crew is a pretty good joke -- but its also a thin one because Gordon-Levitts impish slightly pompous Petit despite repeatedly proclaiming himself mad and crazy is nowhere near as magnetic as the plot needs him to be. And theres barely a clue in the script about who most of his American sidekicks are as people let alone why theyre so into doing this or why they stick around once Petit begins displaying signs of cracking under pressure. (Annie is similarly underdeveloped; Le Bons a pistol in her early scenes but can do only so much once shes sidelined into the role of Obsessed Guys Concerned Ladyfriend Who Says Things Like ""You Should Eat."") For what its worth the third act is a genuine tour de force that nearly redeems everything thats preceded it. Gordon-Levitts chipper explanatory voice-over saps some of the tension from key moments that might have benefited from our forgetting that he lived to tell the tale. But from the minute Petit and his team descend the ramp to the World Trade Centers parking garage the movie becomes an expertly calibrated palm-sweat machine. There are security guards to hide from and stubborn cables to be rigged before the construction crew clocks in -- and this being the roof of an unfinished 110-story building perils abound even before tightrope-walking enters the equation. And finally theres the walk itself in all its simultaneous wonder and terror. Chances are youve seen a hundred costumed heroes leap from roof to roof in hundreds of movies to the point that its like watching a pedestrian hurdle a puddle when it happens. Its never been like this. What Man on Wire did with black-and-white stills and Erik Saties ""Gymnopedie No. 1"" Zemeckis does with 3-D CGI and broad-stroke magic is happening Alan Silvestri cues. And yet its the one moment in the film when more really is more. The 3-D makes us a participant rather than an observer turning the distance between the buildings -- and between the buildings and the ground -- into a physical space the stage for a lucid dream. Zemeckis wants to induce vertigo to trick the body as well as the eye. It works; its unnerving and preview audiences have puked. But it also lets us share in the peace Petit finds up there on that wire. Weve been delivered by thrill-ride technology to a moment of otherworldly calm.

Kate Taylor The Globe and Mail Published Tuesday Sep. 29 2015 550PM EDT Last updated Wednesday Sep. 30 2015 135AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Robert Zemeckis Written by Robert Zemeckis and Christopher Browne Starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Charlotte Le Bon Country USA Language English At an advance screening of The Walk this week moviegoers surrendered their phones opened their bags for inspection and submitted their bodies to metal-detection wands but these days the real battle against piracy is being waged inside the theatre. Of course The Walk is shot in 3D - even if you had managed to smuggle a camera into the show you wouldnt have got any video worth sharing with your friends let alone hawking to a torrent site. But more significantly The Walk is a movie built around a final sequence in which the French acrobat Philippe Petit walks a wire strung between the twin towers of the World Trade Centre in New York. In 3D on an Imax screen that climax provides a vertiginous thrill that can only be experienced in the cinema. And thats the problem with The Walk All the drama leading up to that climax is window dressing or throat clearing. As directed by Robert Zemeckis from a script he co-wrote with Christopher Browne the film limps through its first two acts putting in time until the big moment.That big moment is based on the true story of how Petit a Parisian busker and aerialist surreptitiously strung a wire between the towers and on Aug. 7 1974 crossed to and fro eight times; the movie is inspired by his book about that feat To Reach the Clouds. So our narrator is Petit himself engagingly played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt as a gregarious charmer with a will of iron. He tells his story standing on the very torch of the Statue of Liberty with a rather obviously CGI-generated skyline behind him the film never mentions Sept. 11 2001 but plays heavily on an audiences knowledge of the towers demise.Petit begins by explaining his antecedents as a little French boy who sneaked into a provincial circus and was awed by the tightrope walker as a some-time student of a high-wire master known as Papa Rudy and as a street performer in Paris in the 1970s. Despite Ben Kingsleys sly interpretation of the tight-lipped Papa Rudy who asks Petit to pay for each one of the trade secrets he reveals there is little dramatic weight to what is supposedly a tense teacher-pupil relationship. Similarly the acrobats romance with Annie a troubadour on the streets of Paris feels rote. The Quebec actress Charlotte Le Bon cant make head or tail of the bland young womans emphatic decision to support Petits ambition to string his wire between the two towers he has seen in a magazine in a dentists waiting room.The script is thin but what really makes these scenes excruciating is that we have to listen to them spoken in phony French accents. Zemeckis has apparently determined that audiences will no longer support the fiction that a group of foreign-language characters all speak to each other in English so hes forced to invent all sorts of pretexts for Petit to speak primarily in the language of Hollywood hes going to New York so he must practice; Annie speaks good English so shes happy to establish their relationship in that language. The photographer Jean-Louis joins their scheme; darned if he doesnt speak good English too. Occasionally these characters throw a few well-spoken words of their mother tongue at each other but these little touches of authenticity only underline the improbability of their other conversations.The action then moves to New York as Petit who has pulled off an impressive dry run walking between the twin towers of Notre Dame cathedral begins his final preparations. Here Zemeckis labours away to build suspense - busy elevators; inconvenient security guards a lost cable - but in truth theres no huge drama in a plot to smuggle several hundred pounds of wire cable into a building still under construction when the only life that is threatened is Petits own.So eventually we arrive at the final moment in real life Petit spent 45 minutes on the wire; here Zemeckis successfully milks the walk for every bit of drama it can possibly offer and gets perhaps 10 or 15 minutes of dazzling cinema out of it. Theres a certain phoniness to some of the views of the wire the sky and the ground - that CGI again - but theres no denying the toe-tingling sweaty-palmed effect that is created as we watch Petit put first one foot and then his whole body out into the void.When asked why he did it Petit famously replied there is no why. In the 2008 documentary about his walk Man on Wire the talking heads and archival footage unveiled his feat in all its danger and its daring as an act of human transcendence of the kind we call art. In a movie that itself is so much better at crafting pyrotechnics than creating art Petits walk is brought back down to the earthly level of the stunt.

Its in getting there that the movie stumbles.But as a stunt film ""The Walk"" works. Director Robert Zemeckis (""Back to the Future"" ""Forrest Gump"") stages his centerpiece sequence with audacious visual splendor hovering above his wire walker and swooping up from below him while he dances between the two Towers themselves a marvel to once again behold.Its a majestic sight and Zemeckis goes for broke rendering the sequence in glorious 3-D that is actually worth the upgrade and the occasional discomfort caused by those bulky glasses. (Zemeckis whose animated 2007 feature ""Beowulf"" was also a 3-D eye-popper is on the very short list of directors who have used the medium effectively in the last 10 years.) ""The Walk"" is truly a cinematic experience; its not going to work as well on your iPhone as it does on the big screen in this case the bigger the better.""The Walk"" is a fitting title for a movie that is all about the walk. ""Man on Wire"" the 2008 documentary that told the same story (and won the Academy Award for Best Documentary) did a better job of focusing on the man and Petit is such a fantastic nut that no one can tell his story better than he can himself. (Petit upon ""Man on Wires"" Academy Award win memorably balanced the Oscar statue on his chin.)""The Walk"" opens with Gordon-Levitts Petit talking directly to the audience while the Twin Towers shimmer in the background and as the camera pulls back it is revealed he is standing on the torch of the Statue of Liberty. He stays atop this perch the entire film which is meant to inspire whimsy but instead acts as a rather large green screen distraction.Gordon-Levitts likeability wins out however even when his French accent grates. (Hes like Pepe Le Pew in a bad wig.) We see him performing street art in France and amassing the co-conspirators that will eventually help him perform his World Trade Center ""coup"" though his crew members -- including love interest Annie (Charlotte Le Bon) -- barely register. Only Ben Kingsley as his mentor Papa Rudy leaves an impression and his role is diminished as the story unfolds.""The Walk"" sharpens as the film shifts into heist mode and the set-up for the World Trade Center stunt resembles something of a ""Mission Impossible"" movie. As it comes together the film becomes just as much a tribute to those massive Towers as it is to Petit.Yet the script by Zemeckis and Christopher Browne doesnt do a sufficient job of establishing Petits motives the risks involved with walking on a wire between two buildings a quarter mile above the ground (aside from the obvious) or Petits psyche as the stunt nears.The movie is in a hurry to get to the walk and what a walk it is. But the man on the wire never comes into focus.agrahamdetroitnews.comgrahamoramaThe WalkGRADE B-Rated PG for thematic elements involving perilous situations and for some nudity language brief drug references and smokingRunning time 123 minutesCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1FCFttq MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2015/09/29/movie-review-thrilling-wire-act-grounded-missteps-walk/73057410/,200,thewalk7,thewalk,detroitnews

After all the Oscar-winning documentary about Petits death-defying stunt or artwork or whatever it was ""Man on Wire"" played out almost like a heist thriller and without hitting us over the head with 9/11 references made the point that Petits walk belonged to a simultaneously more innocent and more chaotic era. Especially in the era of full-scale digital effects inaugurated by ""Gravity"" - we could almost call it digital totality - recreating 110-story buildings that no longer exist above an altered cityscape is more possible now than ever before.I can also understand in a more abstract way why Robert Zemeckis the onetime Spielberg acolyte who directed the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" ""Forrest Gump"" ""Flight"" and now ""The Walk"" has a devoted fan base among movie buffs. Zemeckis is devoted to making well-crafted popcorn movies and has always tried to use cutting-edge special effects to tell stories rather than just to bludgeon the audience into submission. I definitely understand the appeal of Joseph Gordon-Levitt who plays Philippe Petit in ""The Walk."" Gordon-Levitt is an immensely likable and talented actor who from his first days in show business has understood himself as both an artist and an entertainer which is exactly how Petit sees himself as well.Put those ingredients together and what do you get? I almost dont know how to describe it except with overlapping and contradictory cliches. ""The Walk"" is much less than the sum of its parts except when the parts are so good you cant ignore them. If this were a short film almost entirely about Petits startling and breathtaking stroll 1200 or so feet above the streets of lower Manhattan - he walked back and forth between the towers three times knelt on the wire and even lay down on it to commune with passing seagulls -- it would be magnificent. The event itself although dangerous impractical and inherently pointless possessed a certain magnificence that captured the imagination of New Yorkers at the time and that Zemeckis and Gordon-Levitt gesture toward without quite reaching.But for most of the films two-hour running time (and it feels a bit longer than that) ""The Walk"" makes no effort to confront the central question that faces all mainstream American movies in this decade and maybe all cinema of all kinds Why am I watching this instead of watching something on TV that is quite likely to be dramatically superior and told in a less condescending and less ostentatious manner? If the 3-D IMAX bigness of ""The Walk"" is supposed to be its own reward or to make up for the films superabundance of flaws - well Im sorry but Im not aboard that train and Im not sure anyone else is either. At the risk of causing anguish among Zemeckis loyalists I will point out that in addition to the films mentioned above this is the guy who directed ""Beowulf"" ""The Polar Express"" and the 2009 Jim Carrey version of ""A Christmas Carol.""It wouldnt be fair to consign ""The Walk"" to that category of overprocessed patronizing and forgettable (not to mention unintentionally terrifying in the case of the Santa-goes-to-Nuremberg nightmare of ""Polar Express"") but that strain of Zemeckis-ness is unmistakably present here. Gordon-Levitt narrates much of the movie as Petit while atop an imaginary perch on the shoulder of the Statue of Liberty. I have no way of knowing whether that was in the script all along (which is by Zemeckis and Christopher Browne and was based on Petits memoir) or was spawned by last-minute producer panic ""Nobodys gonna understand this story unless we explain the whole damn thing"" But in either case its a bad decision made worse by enforced whimsy Gordon-Levitt hams up Petits Franglais just a little (in life the wirewalker speaks fluent English) and wears I swear to God a black turtleneck. Im sure that at some point they tried him out with a red beret and a digital platter of snails before deciding that was un petit peu de trop. You Might Also Like By the time we actually reach Petits exhilarating walk on an August morning high above a depressed crime-ridden and nearly bankrupt city (I suppose this is irrelevant but Petits artistic coup made headlines just two days before Richard Nixons resignation) I was simply exhausted by Zemeckis oppressive insistence that I was being told a valuable thrilling and humorous story and was having a good time. I was worn down first of all by the bogus picture-postcard cuteness of the films depiction of early-70s Paris which in the real world was a troubled and divided city struggling with the wounds of 1968.I was worn down by the winsome comparisons of the young Petit to Charlie Chaplin by the storybook artifice of his childhood as a circus-obsessed kid in a remote French village and by the overly obvious way the script moves the character from speaking French to speaking English long before he leaves his homeland. (To my Yank ears. Gordon-Levitts French is pretty good but its not likely to sound convincing to native speakers.) I was annoyed by the Pointless Winsome Parisian Girlfriend played by Charlotte Le Bon whose actions in the film consist of strumming a Leonard Cohen song and staring deeply into Petits eyes. I was extra-double-annoyed by the Central Casting ""Noo Yawk"" accents of literally everyone he encounters when Petit comes to America and by the crowd scenes where every single extra has been positioned to help focus our attention and is acting his or her ass off. Of course I understand that Zemeckis is not pursuing realism - or at least hed better not be since there is no attempt to depict the social fabric of either city -- and that the manicured artifice of ""The Walk"" represents a series of deliberate choices. But are they good choices or useful choices? When Zemeckis and cinematographer Dariusz Wolski and their immense modeling and digital design team deliver the wordless and transcendent experience of a man risking his life (and the lives of others) for a purpose that cannot be explained and quite likely cannot be justified they hint at the nature of Petits inexplicable achievement.But ""The Walk"" comes nowhere close to what ""Man on Wire"" accomplished in terms of elucidating how and why this extraordinary coup (the right word in both French and English) was pulled off. And along the way Zemeckis undercuts the entire enterprise so thoroughly with a pompous preachy prettified collection of stereotypes and archetypes stuffed with pre-baked homilies about the importance of wonder and dreams that the transcendence feels unearned and untrustworthy. I admire his delicate final codicil which recognizes that something happened to those buildings 27 years after Petits walk that lends his story special resonance without ever mentioning what that was or showing us how that part of the island looks today. In those last images I felt ""The Walk"" finally shed the turtleneck the beret and the fake French accent and address us directly just as it fades to black. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

Courtesy of Sony Pictures hide caption toggle caption Courtesy of Sony Pictures The Walk dramatizes the French high-wire artist Philippe Petits (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) 1974 walk between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center. Courtesy of Sony Pictures In their absence the twin towers have occupied such a significant place in the American conscience it can be easy to forget they were once considered a blight on the landscape. ""Like two file cabinets"" snorts one New Yorker in The Walk Robert Zemeckis exhilarating film about Philippe Petit the French wire-walker who tightroped across the towers as they were nearing completion in 1974. Zemeckis makes our current associations with the World Trade Center a little too explicit at times but his film carries the touching sentiment that buildings are not defined by their architecture. Theyre animated by our imagination and our experiences too. For Petit a street performer and self-styled artiste from Paris the construction of the World Trade Center was a dream clarified the ultimate high-wire act for a man with no respect for proper permits. With a showmans buoyancy and a Maurice Chevalier ahkzent zet takes some getting used to Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Petit as a twinkle-eyed visionary who understands the Towers majesty before anyone else does. After covering the bullet points of Petits backstory--a childhood interest in juggling miming unicycling and wire-walking; a mentorship under circus scion Papa Rudy (Ben Kingsley); an audacious walk across the towers of Notre-Dame Cathedral--the film finally lands in New York City where he and his co-conspirators make plans for the surreptitious walk of the title. The first half of The Walk gets into the origins of Petits philosophy and craft as well as the support he brought with him to America but Zemeckis cant get through that obligatory business fast enough. Once its wheels-down in New York City however Petit (and the movie) really set to work. The second hour of The Walk has the quality of a great heist film Petit assembles a team of trusted confidantes and motley additions stakes out the location plans a complex operation down to the very last bolt and then finally sets about executing it. But for all of his meticulousness there are still plenty of close calls and hair-raising feats of improvisation. Petits self-described ""coup"" has been recounted before in the fine documentary Man on Wire but Zemeckis combination of digital artistry and old-school storytelling chops brings a singularly exquisite tension to the final act. Its not often that a sequence is at once suspenseful and moving but thats where grunt work of establishing the stakes and paying close attention to detail pays off. The audience can feel the tension--and the possible points of vulnerability--in the wire itself and appreciate what it means for Petit (and for America) to be held in precarious balance between the Towers giving them a story to tell. Suddenly these immense file cabinets in the sky have a necessary splash of paint on them and New Yorkers can see them in a new light. The fact that wed see them in another way after theyre gone makes The Walk a stealth September 11 tribute the most beautiful of its kind since the opening credits of Spike Lees 25th Hour. Expanding on a resume that includes Back to the Future Who Framed Roger Rabbit? Contact Forrest Gump and Death Becomes Her The Walk also affirms Zemeckis as a peerless orchestrator of special effects. This is the rare movie thats essential in 3D because Zemeckis takes advantage of the formats potential for depth and visceral pop. Advances in 3D have made comin-atcha effects seem gauche as many of the most celebrated examples (such as Avatar Coraline Hugo and Pina) have focused on creating immersive environments rather than poking viewers in the face. Zemeckis does both inducing the intense vertigo of being suspended 110 stories high while occasionally extending the wire to the seats tendril by tendril. There are plenty of nits to pick about The Walk Gordon-Levitts overcranked performance the excessive whimsy and biopic conventionality of the French section the thinly drawn relationships between Petit and his team the slight overstatement of the September 11 theme. But Zemeckis throws all of the emphasis on the walk itself which minimizes the films annoyances and justifies the groundwork necessary for the big payoff. In that he and Petit have everything in common.

Comments click to enlarge The Walk An IMAX 3D Experience Rated PG  123 minutes  2015 Philippe Petits hair-raising 1974 wire walk between the twin towers of the World Trade Center was recounted in the Oscar-winning documentary Man on Wire (2008) which was superior in every way to this pat dramatization of the stunt by Robert Zemeckis (Cast Away Flight). Zemeckiss main innovation is a narrative frame delivered by Petit (Joseph Gordon-Levitt wearing bangs and suggesting Pepe Le Pew) from the torch scaffolding on the Statue of Liberty and his screenplay--cowritten by Christopher Browne and like the documentary adapted from Petits memoir--settles for the usual dare-to-dream platitudes. Shot in 3-D this delivers some frighteningly vertiginous moments once Petit steps off the South Tower into empty space and Zemeckis wisely milks the climactic wire walk which lasted 45 minutes and drew a crowd of breathless onlookers below for all its worth.

Thats the part before high-wire artist Philippe Petit (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) hits New York in 1974 and strings up a wire between the World Trade Center towers. Director and co-writer Robert Zemeckis kills time with curdled whimsy as Gordon-Levitt speaking in zee outrageous French accent shows us Petits early years as a Paris street magician student of Papa Rudy (Ben Kingsley) and lover of Annie (Charlotte Le Bon). But then oh baby does this movie fly.

Sure James Marshs striking 2008 documentary Man on Wire traveled the same road. But Zemeckis a technical virtuoso does it in 3D IMAX. With the help of a killer FX team and cinematographer Dariusz Wolski The Walk puts us up there 1360 feet above the ground so we can almost feel the swirling air the tautness of the wire and the rush of exhilaration. Well we could if Zemeckis didnt pile on the voice-over telling us exactly what Petit is thinking. Ignore the tell and focus on the show spectacular in every sense. The wondrous Gordon-Levitt has always been an actor of natural acrobatic finesse. Here with lessons from Petit himself he finds the poetic joy in performing that honors what the movie is about a man who truly believes art can give you wings.

But it is a hell of a monument. 108 Shares Share 64 Tweet 34 Share 5 Share Email Print Share Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Photo Sony Pictures Despite their popularity in those all-important Asian markets 3-D and Imax are probably not the future of movies -- I suspect well one day experience most films via virtual reality -- but in the right hands theyre spectacular tools for well spectacle; for any saga that benefits from James Cameron-like GIGANTISM or strives to induce vertigo. You could hardly find a more vertiginous scenario than the Frenchman Philippe Petits highly illegal 1974 wire-walk between the twin towers of the World Trade Center which -- as rendered by director Robert Zemeckis in The WalkA -- will make you feel as if youre plummeting even if (its not really a spoiler) Petit himself remains upright. Petit narrates the film in the person of the American Joseph Gordon-Levitt whose Franche ack-sant will certainly trigger a torrent of croaks from our friends across the pond. But Gordon-Levitts body is a visual coup. He has a supernaturally noodly shape long and bulge-free and vertically pointed with a dancers lift that gracefully tests the laws of gravity. (He makes his black turtleneck a second skin.) Throughout the film he speaks to us -- impishly -- from the torch of Frances gift to the U.S. the Statue of Liberty the towers visible behind him and looks far more at home than he does on terra firma. Zemeckis isnt too at home on Earth either. The problem -- not fatal -- with The Walk is that the narrative wire droops between the movies opening and final sequences. Zemeckis has had his head in technology for a long time and though he wrote the script with Christopher Browne (based on Petits book To Reach the Clouds) he isnt fully engaged by the scenes between Petit and his musician girlfriend (Charlotte Le Bon) whom we meet-cute when he lures away her sidewalk audience with his acrobatics. Is the point is to make us feel as marooned as Petit? Whatever Zemeckis means Gordon-Levitts Pepe Le Pew intonations arent just a minor annoyance They also slow down the pace of the scenes. Petit tells his colleagues to speak English because hes going to America and ""needs to practice"" and you think No its because the multiplex audience wont pay to see movies with subtitles. The vibe is so strained that youll be grateful for Ben Kingsleys hambone turn as Petits wire-walking mentor because Kingsley talks fast and has a couple of good moments directing Petit to bow to audiences in the noblest way -- on the inside. Comparisons to James Marshs Oscar-winning documentary Man on Wire dont do any favors for Zemeckiss storytelling. Marsh tells Petits story using tricks from fictional heist pictures. The movie is part talking heads; part period footage of Petit honing his balance and pulling off lesser -- but still breathtaking -- stunts like a walk over the Sydney Harbor Bridge; and part Mission Impossible-style reenactments. He actually builds momentum better than Zemeckis does and the real Petit is more fabulously silly than Gordon-Levitt He talks of seizing the space defying societys soul-killing laws defining oneself through action. The Twin Towers -- which became Petits idee fixeA -- would be his way of telling the universe ""Monsieur I exist"" But even that documentary recedes when Gordon-Levitts cohorts shoot a rope from one tower to the next crank it up so its nice and taut and watch their nutty friend prepare for launch. My impressions of The Walks lastA half-hour and change are based on seeing it in Imax and 3-D and it would be a shame to do otherwise. As with Gravity pay the surcharge and sit close. Its cheaper than Six Flags. You watch Gordon-Levitt gently put a slim foot on the wire and you know -- you knowA -- hes going to fall even if history says otherwise and Petit is narrating the movie. Your eyes search for a stationary object and dont find it. You think No one could possibly walk 140 feet on something so thin over this much ... air. I was goofy enough in my 20s to put on a parachute and jump out of an airplane and hovering over Gordon-Levitt over the void brought all the crazy sensations back. My sympathetic imagination was so engaged that I was literally afraid to turn my head left or right for fear of losing my balance and when Zemeckis swiveled the camera I caught sight of people in front of me clinging to their companions. Does Zemeckis downplay the wind? Perhaps. But Im not sure my stomach could have handled wind. As it is viewers are reportedly getting sick. In Man on Wire Petit mocks the reporters questions that followed his walk which boiled to ""Why?"" He says ""Very American finger-snapping ... I did somezing magnificent and mysterious and I got a why and ze beauty of eet is zat I dont have a why."" The Walk sanctifies his why-lessness even more than Man on Wire. And it sanctifies the World Trade Center. You will ask How can we gaze on those towers and not see the planes hit them and remember the people who did fall to their deaths? The answer is we do see and remember those things every single time the towers appear onscreen. Although Zemeckis never suggests it I suspect the reason that the towers no longer stand was their power to seize the worlds imagination. They meant one thing to a young Frenchman who dreamed of taking his place between the mightiest edifices in the worlds mightiest metropolis. They meant another not-unrelated thing to other men with other belief systems. Does The Walk acknowledge the towers ultimate fate? Yes in the last few seconds obliquely and exquisitely. By some standards this isnt much of a movie. But it is a hell of a monument.

Sony Pictures Chris Vognar Culture Critic chrisvognar cvognardallasnews.com aThe Walka wows with every step (A) Sep. 29 2015 544pm Close Sharing really is caring... Close Join the conversation... On Facebook With Chris Vognar Comment on one of our official threads. Share This Story Share Discuss Meh The line between gimmicky and magic can be mighty fine but Robert Zemeckis masters it like a seasoned pro in The Walk. He brings the World Trade Center towers back to life in vivid detail right down to the rust on the roof beams. But he does something more something deeply moving. He makes us see the skyscrapers through the eyes of a driven dreamer. And he allows us to feel that dreamers euphoria at the same time we mourn what was forever lost that September morning 14 years ago.The dream belongs to Philippe Petit (played by the ever-game Joseph Gordon-Levitt) a charmingly monomaniacal Frenchman who lives to walk the high wire. He has a circus mentor (Ben Kingsley lord of the ambiguous European accent) a girlfriend (Charlotte Le Bon) and a best friend/official photographer (Ben Schwartz). He also has an unshakable ambition to stretch his wire between the soon-to-be-completed Twin Towers and perform a death-defying walk.The first half of The Walk is pleasantly engaging as Zemeckis dips into his bag of tricks and pulls out some nifty devices transitions from black and white to color dissolves from mock-ups of the towers to the real things and other nimble fare. But thats all foreplay leading to what Petit calls ""the coup"" the grand performance with which hes obsessed. Charlotte Le Bon left as Annie and Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Philippe Petit in ""The Walk."" Takashi Seida/Sony Pictures Entertainment Two courses are served once The Walk hits downtown Manhattan lovingly reimagined for the summer of 1974. The appetizer is the plotting of a caper from the recruitment of a team of accomplices to laying out the details of an inspired criminal endeavor. The recruiting and planning zip along to a propulsive jazz score and a jocular camaraderie that would feel at home in one of the Oceans Eleven movies. James Badge Dale does particularly strong work here as a fast-talking American accomplice whose easy gift of gab carries the crew past one checkpoint after another.But we all know what the main event is here and when it arrives the emotional impact hits like a thunderclap. As Gordon-Levitts Petit stands before the void ready to take his first steps were struck by how eerily real the towers feel as if some cosmic artist rewound reality to Sept. 10 2001.And then he goes out on the wire.Zemeckis has been cinemas great populist illusionist since he took us Back to the Future and asked Who Framed Roger Rabbit? Sometimes his ploys carry a saccharine aftertaste (Forrest Gump); other gambits feel frosty (the motion-capture animation of The Polar Express and A Christmas Carol). But none of that can prepare you for the walk. Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Philippe Petite in ""The Walk."" Sony Pictures The camera seems to be everywhere at once but never in a hurry. It glides overhead and brings us diving down to the buzzing New Yorkers below. More important Zemeckis conjures an absolute suspension of disbelief. We feel were watching a precocious daredevil prance between two impossibly high buildings and were struck anew by the fact that those buildings have ceased to be. Its one of the transcendent sequences in movie history accentuated by the bliss of a man cheating death and our mourning of those who couldnt.Man on Wire the Oscar-winning documentary that chronicles the events of The Walk reminds us that theres no video of the actual feat. Zemeckis seems to have taken this absence as a personal challenge right down to the Imax 3-D format You want images? Ill give you images.You emerge from The Walk in a vertiginous daze of emotion putty in the hands of a magician at the peak of his craft. The Walk (A)Directed by Robert Zemeckis.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays legendary French high-wire walker Philippe Petit in ""The Walk."" (Sony Pictures) By Ann Hornaday September 29 2015 Follow AnnHornaday An infectious buoyant brio infuses ""The Walk"" a sprightly occasionally overeager pop-up book of a movie that features Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the legendary French high-wire walker Philippe Petit. Tearing into his ersatz accent with gusto and joie de vivre that can be as grating as it is ingratiating Gordon-Levitt portrays Petit at the very moment he is transformed from obscure Paris busker into pop-culture sensation by stringing a steel cable between the twin towers of the World Trade Center and dancing across during the morning rush hour Aug. 7 1974. That moment -- of hubris daredeviltry artistic vision and spiritual transcendence -- offers an obvious climax around which to construct ""The Walk"" which Robert Zemeckis has directed as a boisterous fast-paced family-friendly spectacle in 3-D. But first he rewinds to how Petit got started as a multitalented street performer disappointing his middle-class parents and making his way from riding a unicycle and juggling to evincing preternatural balance and grace as an aerialist. In 1968 the teenage Petit spies an image of the proposed World Trade Center in a magazine and immediately feels the tug of what will become his obsession passion and lifes vocation. Tutored in technique and stagecraft by the Czech circus performer called Papa Rudy (Ben Kingsley) Petit embarks on his first ""surprise illegal high-wire walk"" in 1971 at Notre-Dame de Paris the Manhattan towers still beckoning. All of this is related by Gordon-Levitt by way of winsome boldly colorful flashbacks while he narrates the events from atop the Statue of Liberty with the twin towers shining behind him in picture-postcard backlit perfection. Along with his girlfriend Annie (Charlotte Le Bon) and ""accomplices"" he acquires in France he finally arrives in New York to case the joint in person at which point he decides that the towers are ""monsters"" and ""beasts"" that cant possibly be conquered. After some clever reconnaissance during which he and his cohorts dress as architects to get into the building Petit regathers his courage leading his merry band on a perfectly planned prank thats one part ""Oceans Eleven"" and one part P.T. Barnum. As a caper flick ""The Walk"" is an engaging homage to process and problem solving and Gordon-Levitt does a fine job of channeling Petit whose impish sense of mischief belies the messianic ego underneath. But ""The Walk"" takes on truly thrilling heft once the protagonist is atop the first tower and the cable that he is meticulously stringing across the gap hurtles earthward. Zemeckis who is best known for ""Forrest Gump"" and ""Cast Away"" is a proven master of special effects and here he uses 3-D technology with skill and sensitivity The cable sequence kicks off a climax that turns ""The Walk"" from a jolly procedural into a reflective exploration of physical and existential extremes or what Petit himself calls ""ze void."" Forget the admonishment ""dont look down."" Zemeckis forces the viewers perspective to look down up sideways and around with vertiginous verisimilitude. Robert Zemeckis left and Joseph Gordon-Levitt at the New York Film Festival premiere for ""The Walk"". (Charles Sykes/Invision/AP) Filmgoers lucky enough to have seen James Marshs deeply moving 2008 documentary ""Man On Wire"" may see ""The Walk"" as that films shallower less elegiac cousin -- even if both Marsh and Zemeckis note the grim irony that Petits free run of the towers would never be possible in the post-9/11 security state. Zemeckis has never favored subtlety and hes too prone to stridency and obviousness (his Wall Street extras are dressed as though they just woke up and raided the Groovy Seventies bin at Party City). Similarly whereas Marsh paid exquisite homage to the Sept. 11 2001 attacks by never explicitly invoking them Zemeckis turns ""The Walk"" into a revisionist celebration of restoration sentimentalizing (and probably exaggerating) Petits role in making New Yorkers fall in love with the World Trade Center and ending on a note that while undeniably bittersweet still manages to convey a reassuring sense of optimism. [Review On balance Man on Wire reflects a gentler time] Happily theres enough room in the world for each film and its worldview. While ""The Walk"" expertly extrudes Petits story into easily digestible mainstream entertainment it may also send a few curious viewers back to Marshs film which can only be a good thing. In and of itself ""The Walk"" satisfies as an absorbing yarn of authority-flouting adventure and as an example of stomach-flipping you-are-there-ness. The journey it offers viewers doesnt just span 140 feet but also an ethereal now-vanished world. ""The Walk"" (123 minutes at select Imax theaters including AMC Loews Georgetown 14) is rated PG for thematic elements involving perilous situations and for some nudity profanity brief drug references and smoking. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Photo Takashi Seida Associated Press The Walk is a thrilling and unnerving high-wire act 1 / 4 Back to Gallery Right before going to sleep tonight imagine that instead of lying in bed youre balanced on a thick cable over a 1350-foot drop. Imagine that youre looking up into the sky when a bird comes swooping down toward you. Imagine looking at the bird while trying to keep your balance and then think about how youre going to stand up again without falling. If just the thought of this makes the back of your legs tingle then get ready for the exquisite agony of ""The Walk."" The film re-creates the high-wire walk between the twin towers of New Yorks World Trade Center by Philippe Petit in 1974. The 24-year-old French aerialist had planned the crossing for as long as eight years and once he made it to the other side he decided he liked it so much that he went back out for a total of 45 minutes. As crowds below cheered him on he walked on the wire knelt on it and even lay down. Petits feat was the subject of an excellent documentary ""Man on Wire"" (2008) but heres the thing about documentaries Theyre about other people. Narrative features are about you. That is if theyre done well -- and ""The Walk"" is done beautifully -- they create a powerful confusion in the mind so that the protagonists experience feels like your own. ""The Walk"" does this. In fact Ill just say it I dont think Ive ever been more physically affected by a movie. (Im not talking about emotions just physical damage.) After two hours of ""The Walk"" I felt as if Id walked the wire myself. I was agitated and exhausted. During the movie I was squirming and wincing and a few times even had to close my eyes just to find some relief. Hours later this was followed by the obligatory nightmare. And even now thinking about the movie... Video The Walk ""The Walk"" doesnt tap into the fear of heights which not everyone has so much as the fear of falling which is universal. In this the 3-D process becomes central. Robert Zemeckis directed and he is one of the few filmmakers to use the 3-D process with thought and artistry. In his hands its neither a gimmick nor an afterthought but something enmeshed within a complete vision. Petit wasnt Evel Knievel after all not a straight-up daredevil. He saw crossing between the towers as primarily a work of art and Zemeckis presenting the action from Petits point of view never forgets that. In one of the key moments Petit has one foot on the building and the other on the wire and the space in between the buildings is covered in clouds. But when he lifts his foot off the building and commits himself to the wire the clouds fall away and everything is clear. Based on Petits memoir (yes hes alive) the film is presented as a recollection with Joseph Gordon-Levitt narrating sometimes in voice-over but often directly to the audience. Gordon-Levitt adopts a French accent which he attacks with precision and gusto and within 10 seconds viewers wont think it odd to hear him talking like that. It pays to just do something and not be shy about it. The screenplay is not particularly introspective with regard to Petits psychology -- the question ""Whats wrong with that guy?"" is never answered. Nor does it adequately convey the wire-walking expertise that Petit had developed in the years leading up to his twin towers walk. The movie is very good however on the caper aspect. Just to get the rigging to the roof and set it up took years of planning study and stealth not to mention lots of luck. In a way Petit was in more danger before he stepped out onto the wire. Once he did he was a hero. Before that moment he might have gone to jail as a public nuisance. Incidentally the movie becomes a memoir of the 1970s a time at once more innocent and yet more daring less fearful about breaking rules. No one watching Petits glorious stunt in 1974 ever dreamed that the buildings he crossed between were as vulnerable as he was or that he would outlive them. This film couldnt have been made 10 years ago. Just the sight of the towers would have been too upsetting. But enough time has passed that we can now look back on this event as the other big thing that happened at the towers the good thing. As weve come to expect from movies even when we dont get it the technical aspects are handled here with a meticulousness bordering on the magical. The towers are re-created and Gordon-Levitt really does seem to be 110 stories off the ground. Expect to be very worried about him. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet For years all weve had are the pictures--spectacular still images of the man on the wire walking fearlessly between the peaks of two skyscrapers a pole in his arms a gaping abyss at his feet. Theyve been enough frankly to secure a spot in the collective imagination for Philippe Petit the French aerialist who turned the World Trade Center into his high-altitude stage. Who needs a phony dramatization when photographic evidence of the real deal is a mouse-click away? Yet The Walk the latest feat of technological wizardry from Robert Zemeckis does more than simply send Petits death-defying stunt into motion. It puts audiences up there on that thin cable with him letting them see the world as he saw it from 100 stories up. Every groan and sway of the wire registers. The depth of the mighty drop is overwhelming. And its easy to believe again in the sheer enormity of the Twin Towers resurrected from scratch by the director of Back To The Future and Who Framed Roger Rabbit? Of course most of The Walk is pure prelude 80 minutes of time killing until Petit takes that first momentous step off the edge of the south tower. (They might well have called it The Wait.) Such delayed satisfaction is not incompatible with the thematic thrust of the material; Zemeckis and his co-writer Christopher Browne float the idea that Petits whole life was a long build to this single majestic moment. Even still theres a bit too much Gumpian whimsy to the movies first half which chronicles the salad days of this famous wire-walker (played with an exaggerated French accent but credible physicality by Joseph Gordon-Levitt). Perched on the peak of the Statue Of Liberty the towers visible behind him Petit breaks the fourth wall to narrate his own adventures including his tutelage under tough-love mentor Papa Rudy (Ben Kingsley in Hugo mode) and his courtship of fellow street performer Annie Allix (Charlotte Le Bon).The Walk probably wouldnt exist were it not for Man On Wire the Oscar-winning documentary on Petits triumphant performance. Those who have seen the earlier film will struggle not to catalog the ways that the new one deviates especially as many of the anecdotes have been recycled. Zemeckis a showman in his own right seems intoxicated by the artistic ambitions of his subject--so much so that he cant help but gloss over some of the less flattering aspects of Petits personality. (As played by JGL hes more of an occasionally stubborn dreamer than the megalomaniac described by the talking heads of Man On Wire.) Since The Walk is technically based on Petits own memoir To Reach The Clouds its not surprising that it ends up marginalizing his accomplices. Those characters that arent shuttled off to the sidelines as Le Bons love interest basically is are reduced to caricatures the most egregious of which is probably a perpetually baked late-hire (Benedict Samuel) who speaks almost exclusively in cliched pothead lingo.It was perhaps inevitable given the subject matter that The Walk was going to dually function as a valentine to the Twin Towers. (A dozen years removed from the days when filmmakers were respectfully digitally removing them from skyline shots we now have a blockbuster that uses CGI to erect them anew.) Zemeckis a gooey crowd-pleaser at heart overplays the hushed reverence at times using heavy-handed dialogue to suggest that it was Petits audacious walk that ""brought them to life"" for many New Yorkers (the towers were famously derided as giant filing cabinets upon construction) and closing on a final shot better suited to a postage stamp than a movie. These sentimental gestures inflated to IMAX proportions through the overbearing swell of Alan Silvestris score feel harmless but unnecessary Theres more than enough poignancy in simply seeing the grand structures recreated with such loving meticulous care.To that end The Walk doesnt find its footing until it arrives upon that fateful date in 1974 and relocates to the World Trade Center effectively transforming from a corner-cutting biopic into a tense procedural heist picture. The ""coup"" as Petit called it is plenty thrilling on its own; seeing these men infiltrate the building talk their way to the top and race against the clock to get the wire in place is the stuff of first-rate popcorn entertainment. (One irresistible touch The accomplice with him on the roof is terrified of heights.) But its when the walk portion of The Walk arrives that this unevenly scripted fact-based thriller achieves its full potential. Even without the suspense of uncertainty the sequence achieves a bated-breath intensity and wonder. Its a true marvel of vertigo-inducing special effects with Zemeckis employing photorealistic technique to create a sprawling metropolitan void and finding a rare essential use for 3-D--namely to stretch and expand the depth of field making us feel every foot separating Petit from the street far below. Good luck getting the same sensation from a still image real or not.

But I cant. Not that I was disappointed. Simply underwhelmed.  | 1/2 out of 4 stars By Colin Covert Star Tribune September 29 2015 -- 808pm Sony Pictures Joseph Gordon-Levitt portrays Philippe Petit in ""The Walk. "" about high-wire artist Petits cabled walk between New York Citys World Trade Center Twin Towers in 1974. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint French tightrope walker Philippe Petits 1974 high-wire stroll between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center is solid gold film material. It was death-defying. It was illegal. It was in its own poetic terms one of the 20th centurys greatest works of art. Like Petits stratospheric ballet James Marshs exuberant 2008 documentary ""Man on Wire"" set the bar sky-high and reached the goal. Following Petits break-in at the nearly complete construction site with his crew of inexperienced accomplices Marsh combined interesting textures of storytelling. He gave us the suspense of a bank heist thriller the daredevil excitement of Evel Knievel flying a jet-powered motorcycle and flicks of black humor as the plan more and more exceeded the boundaries of common sense. ""Man on Wire"" won the documentary Oscar and for years since Ive been eager to see a big-budget Hollywood take on Petits amazing midair stroll. Now it has arrived. Id love to say that I was delighted by Robert Zemeckis ""The Walk"" from start to finish. But I cant. Not that I was disappointed. Simply underwhelmed. It just didnt click for me. The tone here is harmless forgettable fun. In real life Petit was a flawed edgy narcissist the sort of rebel qualities that make us want to know more about him. In the new version (played by Joseph Gordon Levitt in a Gallic accent and Windex-blue contact lenses) he is different from a standard action hero and stock good guy largely by being exceptionally cute. He introduces us to the story by speaking to the camera on the torch of the Statue of Liberty a flashback to a time when the Twin Towers were still the skylines summit. Zemeckis who has given us copious family-friendly comedies tells the story with lots and lots of added sugar. As he moves the story forward rushing to establish a whole host of characters and situations he returns us again and again to the winsome Petit on top of Lady Liberty addressing us about the next plot twist. No worries folks; while this quixotic undertaking is danger-filled not much is actually at stake. Sony Pictures Charlotte Le Bon and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in ""The Walk."" We follow Petit from his late 1960s origins as a Parisian street mime and juggler to his mastering acrobatic skills under the mentorship of Papa Rudy a circus veteran played by Ben Kingsley in full charm mode. While Petit falls in love with Annie Allix (Charlotte Le Bon) another street performer he is largely driven by mad romantic dreams. He considers himself a rare artist in pursuit of glory and life-affirming creative beauty. He walks between the peaks of Notre Dame cathedral but wants to go ever higher. When he sees news reports of New York Citys twin skyscrapers the worlds tallest buildings at the time he begins developing a scheme to enter secretly and walk from one edge to the other 1350 feet off the ground. Its a remarkable project but ""The Walk"" doesnt heat it up to boiling. It features striking visuals (though some of the computer generated effects make Gordon Levitt look as cartoonish as anything in Zemeckis ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit""). Yet it offers the shallowest sort of storytelling. For the first 90 minutes the story has none of the gravity of a high-wire walk. It simply introduces us to colorful superficial New York stereotypes who want to help Petit or could stop him. When he essentially confesses his break-in strategy to the customs officer checking him in to the city the cop laughs and waves him through. Yes airport security was lighter those days but come on. In the final 25 minutes we gaze down 110 digitally created floors while Petit walks kneels and dances on the high wire. That make-believe quarter-mile view is by far the deepest thing in the film.

Photo Credit Sony Pictures advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The story of Philippe Petits 1974 high-wire walk between Manhattans Twin Towers. Rated PG. BOTTOM LINE A razzle-dazzle thriller with eye-popping visuals white-knuckle tension and just the right note of melancholy. CAST Joseph Gordon-Levitt Charlotte Le Bon Ben Kingsley LENGTH 204 Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays the high-wire artist Philippe Petit in ""The Walk"" which tells how this Parisian street performer mesmerized New Yorkers one August morning in 1974 by traversing a self-rigged cable between the Twin Towers. Petit narrates the movie while standing cheekily atop Lady Liberty. Its a significant spot That statue like Petits graceful walk is another much-loved gift bestowed upon us by the French. That combination of historical symbolism and visual whimsy defines ""The Walk"" directed with big-budget razzle-dazzle by Robert Zemeckis (""Flight"") who wrote the script with Christopher Browne from Petits book ""To Reach the Clouds."" Its essentially a heist movie -- Petits stunt was utterly delightfully illegal -- set in a more innocent and trusting era. ""The Walk"" also strikes just the right note of melancholy for the 110-story holes left in Manhattans skyline on Sept. 11 2001. advertisement | advertise on newsday Gordon-Levitt might not quite nail Petits accent -- he sometimes sounds like a certain animated skunk -- but he perfectly captures the mans oh-so-French personality friendly passionate artistic arrogant. ""The Walk"" tracks Petit from his younger years to his romance with a fellow busker Annie (Charlotte Le Bon of ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"") and finally to his quixotic and mind-boggling complex mission in New York. Guided by the wisdom of a circus veteran Papa Rudy (Ben Kingsley) and aided by some unlikely accomplices (Jean-Francois played by Cesar Domboy whos terrified of heights) Petit mounts a plan that itself balances between art and insanity. Zemeckis high-tech trickery makes the Twin Towers real enough to touch -- Petit even presses his forehead against one -- though it sometimes gives this 3-D movie a cartoonish feel. Loose cables plummet toward us an arrow nearly spears us a seagull greets us in the clouds. Such digitally assisted moments remove us from the real world and put us in the realm of fantasy though thats clearly Zemeckis intention. Aside from some mild cursing ""The Walk"" is essentially a family film full of excitement danger physical humor (the climactic walk is as thrilling and funny as an old Harold Lloyd movie) and an overall sense of magic. Here the Twin Towers seem to exist in a fairy tale like Jacks beanstalk. Once upon a time of course they were real. 239 MoviesThe Walk trailer Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

The Walk (PG) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Walk (PG) Director Robert Zemeckis recreation of a historic high-wire act is a vertiginous thrill. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com9/30/2015 Editor rating 3 The story of Philippe Petit -- the deranged Frenchman who rounded up a gang of like-minded maniacs strung a wire between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center and spent 45 minutes bouncing around on it on the morning of Aug. 7 1974 -- has been told before on film (2008s Oscar-winning documentary Man on Wire) and on the page (by Petit in his memoir To Reach the Clouds). But The Walk is the first time youre able to have an inkling of what it felt like to teeter on a steel cable a quarter-mile in the air above the streets of Manhattan thousands of people gawking up at you the only thing keeping you from plunging to your death your own balance. And how does it feel? Some of the attendees at the hoity-toity New York Film Festival this weekend where The Walk premiered responded by throwing up on their expensive tuxedos (this has been confirmed as fact not a publicists hoax). Sitting inside an IMAX 3D theater (where The Walk will screen exclusively until Oct. 8 before opening wider) I did not hurl but I did plant my feet on the ground repeatedly just to make sure it was there and my palms did perspire (a peculiar sensation hand-sweat). For those who already suffer from a touch of vertigo The Walk will probably be too much to endure. And if youre not afraid of heights prepare to be. Director Robert Zemeckis would take these reactions as a compliment. The filmmaker has had a peculiar career alternating between carefully constructed gems of genre narratives (Back to the Future Used Cars Contact) and pictures that existed primarily to showcase the wonders of special-effects technology (Who Framed Roger Rabbit The Polar Express Beowulf). Zemeckis won his Oscar for directing Forrest Gump which also involved some bits of visual trickery but was otherwise an uncharacteristically hammy and patronizing bauble for an artist who has favored edgier darker fare (yes I know Forrest Gump is beloved; its still terrible). In The Walk Zemeckis again succumbs to the allure of shiny machines -- here is a movie comprised of as much CGI as any of the Star Wars prequels -- except the artifice is designed to pass for reality and the illusion is absolute. What matters about The Walk is not how well Joseph Gordon-Levitt captures Petits breathless enthusiasm and French accent (he nails them) or that all the other characters in the film are thin enough to be blown away by a mild breeze (as a Paris street musician Charlotte Le Bons role might have well be named Love Interest). The incessant narration by Petit who addresses the viewer directly while standing on the torch of the Statue of Liberty at times feels like babbling (the movie gives you the feeling that Petit was a handful). But what matters the most in The Walk is that you believe what you see even though your brain tells you the World Trade Center is no longer there and that Gordon-Levitt isnt really standing 110 stories above the ground without a net and that no you cant really fall headlong into that vertiginous IMAX screen although you will probably still clutch your armrests to be safe. The Walk has been made with the same genial spirit a judge used when he sentenced Petit to perform a free show for children in Central Park for his crime. This is a love letter to lunacy (and an unspoken tribute to the iconic towers) that lets you feel what its like to tread where only gods dare.

(Sony)By Steven Rea Inquirer Movie CriticPosted October 01 2015Robert Zemeckis is trying something beautiful and perhaps impossible in The Walk to reclaim the Twin Towers taking the World Trade Center edifices back from the nightmarish taint of terrorism the trauma of 9/11 and celebrating human ambition and folly in the process. By bringing his visual mastery to bear on the story of Philippe Petit the French daredevil who in the summer of 1974 crossed the 140 feet between the New York skyscrapers balancing on a cable 1350 feet in the air Zemeckis pulls off not only a dazzling optical illusion but a historical illusion too.Opening Wednesday in IMAX theaters and in wider release Oct. 9 The Walk feels like one of those 50s Hollywood spectacles - Around the World in 80 Days say - only hyper-enhanced with cutting-edge digital and 3D technology. To be sure this is a movie worth the extra bucks to experience in its giant stereoscopic format the wheeling birds-eye views the exhilarating sensation of edging along the taut wire as Petit does the clouds and crowds below.Its also a movie in which the characters albeit based on real-life figures are anything but. As played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt speaking with zee French accent and zee showy flair of a street performer Petit is more of a cartoon than the titular lapin of Zemeckis groundbreaking animation/live-action fusion Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Jauntily positioned atop another New York landmark the Statue of Liberty Gordon-Levitts Petit addresses the audience narrating his own story flashing back to his childhood (magical circus performers narrow-minded parentals) his apprenticeship with a Czech trapeze artist (Ben Kingsley) and Petits meet-cute with a fetching sidewalk busker Annie (Charlotte Le Bon) who later accompanied him to New York.The Paris that Zemeckis and his FX team have dreamed up with its cute cars and cafes has the cue-the-extras backlot ambience of a vintage MGM musical. When Petit and Annie pack their bags and head for the Big Apple that city too looks sprung from the pages of a pop-up picture book the sun-burnished brownstones the bustling avenues the gruff but amenable construction workers pushing to finish the towers upon which Petit is plotting his ""coup.""For a more realistic - and in fact more suspenseful - account of Petits majestically loony and decidedly illegal stunt and the elaborate plans it necessitated James Marshs 2008 Oscar-winning documentary Man on Wire is the film to see. (Marshs reenactments play like a great noir heist pic.) But as The Walk similarly makes clear Petits death-defying high-wire act required complicated logistics and the recruitment of a team of confederates to facilitate the daunting challenge of getting a 400-pound cable up the elevators to the rooftop of one tower and then somehow flung across and secured to the other. Without detection. It was a stealth operation to make a Navy SEAL team proud.Of course Petit in his cat burglar getup did triumph on that August day. As a celebration of agility ability and outlandish human behavior The Walk is a winning thing. It may not get inside the head of its pole-balancing protagonist - it doesnt really even try - but Zemeckis movie takes you skyward.MOVIE REVIEW The Walk  (Out of four stars)Directed by Robert Zemeckis.

Photo Courtesy of Sony Pictures MOVIE REVIEW The Walk Running time 123 minutes. Rated PG (brief nudity/drug references mild swearing). In theaters Tuesday night. Robert Zemeckis ""The Walk reaches for the sky when aerialist Philippe Petit mounts a wire perilously stretched between the original World Trade Center towers two-thirds of the way through this lighthearted docudrama which makes great use of the 3-D IMAX format. The trailers suggest a realistic thriller not unlike ""Man on Wire which covered much the same ground and won the 2008 Oscar for Best Documentary. But the family-friendly film which had its world premiere Saturday night at the New York Film Festival instead approaches history with a more fantastical and comic tone not unlike Zemeckis ""Forrest Gump. Joseph Gordon-Levitts Pepe Le Pew-ish French accent takes getting used to but he turns out to be an inspired choice to play Petit a former Paris street mime who first gains public attention when he wire-walks between the towers of Notre Dame cathedral. Gordon-Levitts comic chops and infectious likability help get you past what amounts to lengthy prologue about Petits obsession with wire-walking which crystallizes when he sees a drawing of the WTC towers in a magazine. Photo Courtesy of Sony PicturesWith advice from a circus-aerialist mentor (Ben Kingsley) and emotional support from his girlfriend (Charlotte Le Bon) Petit arrives in 1974 New York. He smuggles suspicious gear through customs by joking about what hes actually planning to do -- and waltzes into one of the still-under-construction towers simply by donning a hardhat. Atop the towers a ragtag conspirator fires an arrow between the roofs so a 140-foot-long wire can be strung between them. The film up to here is sometimes slow and occasionally corny -- and doesnt strictly follow the facts something signaled by Petits abundant narration delivered by Gordon-Levitt from the torch of the Statue of Liberty. But Zemeckis finally delivers the goods in abundance in the section that really counts A vertigo-inducing digital re-creation of Petits famous walk back and forth between the towers 110 stories above street level. The tension is goosed a bit with Petits fantasies of what might go wrong. In the end ""The Walk finds a graceful way to pay tribute not only to Petits bravery and determination -- but to the thousands lost on 9/11 in the buildings this daredevil loved so much.

EntertainmentMovies The Walk a high-wire act for Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Philippe Petit Originally published September 29 2015 at 300 pm Updated September 29 2015 at 1139 am ""The Walk"" follows Philippe Petits historic high-wire walk between the World Trade Center towers in 1974. Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars. (Courtesy of Sony Pictures/AP) A review of ""The Walk"" a meticulously rendered yet somehow lackluster account of Philippe Petits historic high-wire walk between the World Trade Center towers in 1974. Rating 2.5 stars out of 4. Share story By Moira Macdonald Seattle Times movie critic ""The Walk"" tells a story so astonishing it almost doesnt need to be a movie; maybe its better that Philippe Petits miraculous stroll on a wire suspended a quarter-mile above lower Manhattan lives on perfectly in our imaginations. Robert Zemeckis film about how a 24-year-old Frenchman schemed to rig and walk a wire between the two World Trade Center towers in 1974 has been many years in the making. But while its clearly constructed with meticulous care with the wire-walking scenes as breathtaking as CGI allows it lacks a certain well je ne sais quoi. Anyone whos seen James Marshs Oscar-winning 2008 documentary ""Man on Wire"" (and if you havent you have a treat in store) knows that Petit is a true original -- part artist and part madman fond of making dramatic pronouncements in his zestily accented English. (""Death is looking through the golden frame of this dream"" he notes in that film of his quest.) Hes the sort of character in other words whos hard to make up and even harder to script and Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Petit struggles with both the accent (which too often sounds cartoony) and the dialogue. ""I am not going to do this with a safety line This I will not do"" he hisses; maybe the real Petit could sell this but the actor cant. Additionally Gordon-Levitts a decade too old for the role -- which shouldnt matter much but does as part of this insane feats charm is the very young man at its center. ""The Walk"" by necessity spends much time on the preparations for the WTC walk some of which take on the zany tone of a comedic heist. (Oddly though the movie rushes through Petits development as a wire-walker quickly taking us from a line a few feet from the ground to a death-defying walk between the spires of Notre Dame as if it were a natural progression.) But it finally soars only when the script falls away leaving only a man in black gliding a slippered foot across an absurdly thin steel rope walking among the clouds. It looks great in ""The Walk"" -- but it looked pretty good in my head too. Movie Review 1/2   The Walk with Joseph Gordon-Levitt Ben Kingsley Charlotte Le Bon James Badge Dale. Directed by Robert Zemeckis from a screenplay by Zemeckis and Christopher Browne. 123 minutes. Rated PG for thematic elements including perilous situations and for some nudity language brief drug references and smoking. Several theaters (opening Sept. 30 on IMAX 3D screens only; expanding Oct. 9). Moira Macdonald 206-464-2725 or mmacdonaldseattletimes.com.

Kenneth Turan Before New Yorks World Trade Center and the date 9/11 walked lock-step into eternity those enormous twin towers were best known for something else entirely something joyous and a little bit insane.That would be the 45 minutes that a 24-year-old French aerialist named Philippe Petit spent on Aug. 7 1974 walking back and forth on a cable stretched 200 feet between looming structures at close to 1400 feet above the ground. In todays high-tech movie world it is almost inevitable that that day in the clouds the subject of James Marshs altogether splendid Oscar-winning documentary ""Man on Wire"" would for better and worse attract the attention of writer-director Robert Zemeckis.SIGN UP for the free Indie Focus movies newsletter gt;gt; For better and worse because Zemeckis films including ""Forrest Gump"" the ""Back to the Future"" franchise and ""The Polar Express"" are often more adventurous technologically than dramatically and that is definitely the case with ""The Walk.""

Video by Jason H. Neubert. See more videos Based on Petits memoir ""To Reach the Clouds"" and co-written by Zemeckis and Christopher Browne ""The Walk"" couldnt be more pedestrian and earthbound as it slogs through the early parts of the wire walkers pre-World Trade Center life.Only in the films final section when it uses the magic of computer-generated imagery to astonishingly re-create Petits feat making you feel as if you are on the wire with him does ""The Walk"" begin to soar. The film opens Sept. 30 in Imax 3-D before premiering in other formats next week and given how exclusively visual its virtues are Imax is the way to go. Director Robert Zemeckis walks The Walk as a quixotic filmmaker Steven Zeitchik Like a ships signal lamp or a backward Beatles album the movies of the Hollywood filmmaker Robert Zemeckis will throw off a pattern if you pay close enough attention.

Like a ships signal lamp or a backward Beatles album the movies of the Hollywood filmmaker Robert Zemeckis will throw off a pattern if you pay close enough attention. Many of them involve a repeating character a dreamer with a quixotic streak. Its a person who has a slightly sideways view of... (Steven Zeitchik) Its a mark of how dramatically uninvolving the early parts of ""The Walk"" are that even as fine an actor as Joseph Gordon-Levitt who plays Petit cant bring them to life. For one thing Gordon-Levitt is hampered by a French accent that initially at least is unhappily reminiscent of cartoon character Pepe Le Pew. And he and everyone else has to cope with the films gee-whiz sentimental tone that leads to ideas like having Petit narrate the film standing on the torch of the Statue of Liberty.Back we go to Paris 1973 and Petits life as a unicycling mime wire walker and street performer who steals croissants off tourists tables (3-D makes this look even hokier than it sounds) and is always looking for ""the perfect place to hang my wire.""That quest leads him to the beautiful Annie Allix (""The Hundred-Foot Journeys"" Charlotte Le Bon) a street singer who falls under Petits spell even though by all appearances he is an arrogant irritating not particularly likable fellow.Standard issue flashbacks show us the beginnings of Petits interest in wire walking and introduce us to his first teacher and mentor Papa Rudy Omankowsky of the famous White Devils aerial troupe (played with altogether too much brio by Ben Kingsley.)Its in a dentists office of all places that Petit has his eureka moment when he sees a magazine story about the soon-to-be-constructed World Trade Center towers. He steals the article takes it home and draws a pencil line between the buildings. ""With this tiny pencil I sealed my fate"" Petit says with his usual portentousness. ""This was the birth of my dream.""Completely obsessed with the towers Petit begins to gather people he calls ""accomplices"" for what he visualizes not as a mere performance but as a spectacular ""coup"" something he is sure will be considered ""the most audacious work of art.""Once in New York Petit investigates the rhythms and systems of the towers as rigorously as the French jewel thieves in Jules Dassins ""Rififi"" case their target and he gathers more accomplices These include the French-speaking Jean-Pierre (James Badge Dale) and the dramatically whiskered Barry Greenhouse (Steve Valentine) the expeditions inside man.The closer ""The Walk"" gets to Petit actually getting on the wire the more interesting it becomes and the films final 20 minutes when you see the aerialist going back and forth and back and forth with all of Lower Manhattan unfolding beneath his feet are alternately mesmerizing exhilarating and terrifying.Gordon-Levitt took an intense week of wire walking lessons from Petit himself and he managed the simpler walking on his own. For trickier maneuvers however double Jade Kindar-Martin stepped in with the filmmakers digitally replacing his face with the actors.Getting the city that appears under Petits feet to look real was the work of a small army of digital technicians led by visual effects supervisor Kevin Baillie and his Atomic Fiction organization. Baillies team of 15 took three months to create the city and the twin towers followed by five months of work by more than 100 CGI artists to integrate that world with the walking footage.It would be swell if all of ""The Walk"" came together as beautifully as the computer effects do but it would also be churlish not to appreciate what we do have. This film may not talk the talk but it definitely walks the walk and for that we are grateful.kenneth.turanlatimes.com------------The WalkMPAA rating PG for thematic elements involving perilous situations and for some nudity language brief drug references and smokingRunning time 2 hours 2 minutesPlaying In general releaseMORE REVIEWSHotel Transylvania 2 has more heart less raunchThe Intern is a Nancy Meyers comedy for better or worseGreen Inferno mixes social activist message with cannibalism Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Reviews Entertainment Movies Joseph Gordon-Levitt Ben Kingsley PG Rated Movies Read more movie reviews gt;gt; Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad84deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-walk-review-20150930-story.html,200,thewalk26,thewalk,latimes

Updated July 30 2016  610 am Full Forecast News Sports Business Go Life Buy/Sell Movie reviews Review 3-D film The Walk is quite a ride By Calvin Wilson St. Louis Post-Dispatch Calvin Wilson Sep 29 2015 (...) From the second he learns that the World Trade Center will soon grace the New York skyline street busker and self-styled artist Philippe Petit (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is obsessed. The very idea of walking a tightrope between the Twin Towers strikes Petit who charms tourists out of loose change on the streets of Paris as beautiful. And he has a great appreciation for beauty.What he doesnt have are the skills necessary for the walk -- and thats where Papa Rudy (Ben Kingsley) comes in. The paterfamilias of a circus wire-walking act Papa Rudy has all the knowledge that Petit requires to accomplish his goal and agrees to be his mentor. But he also worries that his apprentice is a bit too reckless.With time running out to attempt the walk Petit his busker girlfriend Annie (Charlotte Le Bon) and a couple of recruits to his cause embark for New York -- where a challenge of enormous magnitude looms before them. If Petit is successful on the morning of Aug. 7 1974 New Yorkers will witness a spectacle that the most jaded of them wouldnt have believed possible.The real-life story that inspired ""The Walk"" was also told in the fine 2008 documentary ""Man on Wire."" But the new film will unquestionably reach a much wider audience and deservedly so. Youll come for the 3-D effects (the 2-D version opens Oct. 9) but youll stay for the escalating drama. Working from a script co-written with Christopher Browne director Robert Zemeckis (""Forrest Gump"") pulls off a fabulous trick of his own delivering a mainstream entertainment that has at its heart a poetic sensibility. Of course ""The Walk"" may be appreciated simply as a caper film and Gordon-Levitt beguilingly captures Petits irresistible charisma in a performance that completes his transition from indie-film favorite to big-budget star.This is a tale of an artist with a dream that improbably but fantastically came true.What ""The Walk"" Four stars out of four Run time 203 Rated PG Content Perilous situations nudity language drug references smoking  Calvin Wilson  314-340-8346calvinwilsonstl on Twittercalvinwilsonpost-dispatch.com The Walk Four stars out of four Run time  203 Rated  PG Content  Perilous situations nudity language drug references smoking Tags The Walk Calvin Wilson St. Louis Post-dispatch Calvin Wilson Calvin Wilson is an arts writer for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

Petits escapades last told in James Marshs terrific 2008 documentary ""Man on Wire"" provide an ideal template for a crowdpleaser striking exactly the sort of celebratory tone to set the stage for three weeks of cinema. Most of all ""The Walk"" worked for the opening night slot because it makes a passionate case for the power of the big screen moviegoing experience. While it fails to convey the depth of Petits bold ambition and its sugary tone waters down the drama of his reckless antics the striking image of Petit traveling between the towers with only a balancing beam as his guide translates quite nicely to cinematic terms. Zemeckis a filmmaker whose career blossomed in a blockbuster age when many more viewers preferred the theatrical experience to home entertainment pushes that agenda in nearly every scene. From its opening minutes ""The Walk"" unleashes a grab bag of tricks engineered for a large format. Presented at the festival in RealD 3D it features eye-popping IMAX-friendly visuals that poke out at viewers eyeballs and sometimes threaten to pierce them. As Petit recalls his early performance artist days as a mime on the Parisian streets Zemeckis presents the playful character in black-and-white while individual objects that figure into his antics stand out in color. He juggles bowling balls that hover just beyond the edges of the screen but the grey images point to the silent film era -- a Chaplinesque quality that connects the story to cinemas past. Collectively the effects wizardry amounts to a depiction of its carefree protagonists fantastical life and the way he sees himself as so much larger than it. Petit is a showman readymade for luring the masses to the multiplexes an agenda to which Zemeckis can no doubt relate. For most part all these elements dont interfere with a story thats all about the extreme desire to put on a good show. But the one problematic special effect is the accents. The enjoyably smarmy Gordon-Levitt does his best to imitate French cadences but in this case imitation is less a form of flattery than accidental parody. It only gets worse once Ben Kingsley surfaces as gruff circus manager Papa Rudy who helps train Petit against his better judgement. A British actor playing a Czech immigrant speaking French Kingsleys considerable talent fails to work around this mangled approach. Fortunately ""The Walk"" mainly focuses on Petits physicality rather than his eloquent dialogue which makes its distracting qualities largely forgivable. More problematic however is the one-note quality allotted to the movies sole female character Petits main squeeze Annie (Charlotte Le Bon) whos hardly more than an ongoing source of encouragement for Petits daring plans. Her underdeveloped behavior points to the movies lack of investment in creating a credible environment. The early seventies in the United States an era of tremendous cultural upheaval war protests and national confusion over the countrys direction never enters the pictures. While it brings Petits story into the 21st century with a series of closing acknowledgments of the Twin Towers history the identity politics of ""The Walk"" feel decidedly retro. Yet no matter its numerable shortcomings everything in ""The Walk"" is artifice and at times that works in its favor. Unlike the documentary Zemeckis version shows less interest in Petites ethically dubious behavior and instead reduces his story to a simplistic Disneyfied notion of chasing ones dreams. Of course no working filmmaker enlivens that concept better than Zemeckis and to that end ""The Walk"" is a fun distraction. The director uses the wide screen to convey the thrill of the tightrope experience from unsettling moments when Petit chooses to look down to extreme closeups as his feet start to tremble on the rope. These queasy shots would hardly carry the same impact on a tiny screen. But the movie truly comes alive once Petit reaches his destination as the camera swirls around him in a simulated environment just a few steps shy of a virtual reality experience. Dangling between the towers while seemingly all of New York watches from afar Petit exists in a unique arena of his own making. Even so with CGI elements standing out the sequence reeks of fabrication. Zemeckis various experiments with motion capture animation would have been welcome here since both the mood of ""The Walk"" and the way it explores various themes register as cartoonish. However the movies weakest link involves routine cutaways to Petit speaking directly at the camera from a simulated Statue of Liberty. Narrating the story from his imaginary perch Petit interrupts the action far too often at times breaking up the suspense of individual moments. His backdrop sets up a thin statement on the possibilities of the American dream as the Twin Towers linger poignantly in the background. More than that the Green Screen Guide epitomizes Zemeckis affection for movie magic. That fixation stretches across the mainstream offerings in the NYFF lineup which also includes Ridley Scotts CGI-heavy survival thriller ""The Martian"" and Steven Spielbergs ""Bridge of Spies."" Thirty years ago these same filmmakers comfortably indulged in the possibilities of the big screen spectacle. Today theyre battling to keep it relevant. ""The Walk"" is peppered with dialogue that speaks to the power of the theatrical spectacle -- and its reliance on viewers to care about it. ""There is no show without an audience"" Papa Rudy says which may as well serve as the filmmakers thank you note to anyone who turned up. ""The Walk"" certainly speaks to the balancing act of keeping the appeal of the theatrical moviegoing experience in check in an age of rising home viewing habits. Like Petites wire its still there but the anxiety that it could break at any moment hovers all around it.

(Also there is a huge difference between speaking French -- which he does -- and having a workable French accent -- which he does NOT.) Reply Christine Rubens May 12 2016 547 pm I think its ironic that the writer felt Mr. Gordon-Levitts accent was ""accidental parody"" since his college degree is in French. Reply Dee J May 12 2016 547 pm A much greater concern than the spectacle of The Walk was the highly suspect programming of the ""New York"" short films programming. Absolute nonsensical hodgepodge of faux experimental deadpan ironic films that might pass for something somewhat interesting as a first-year project at RISD. And no surprise that every filmmaker White. Since when are classical narrative films so passe with millennial sensibility? Absolutely depressing to watch a collection of detached over conceptualized drivel. Reading the copy in the NYFF program about these shorts is even more hysterical.

Director Robert Zemeckis takes a goofy approach at first but the walk itself is astonishing.Joseph Gordon -Levitt stars as Philippe Petit the tight-rope walker who staged a walk between the Twin Towers in 1974.(Photo TriStar Pictures)Story HighlightsCritics review 3.5 starsJoseph Gordon-Levitt uses a French accent to good effect.Director Robert Zemeckis use of effects for the walk itself is astonishing.Usually you dont want to be late for a movie.Who knows? You might miss some crucial information that would make enjoying or understanding the film impossible. At best youll feel like youre playing catch-up the whole time.If youre going to see ""The Walk"" however -- and make no mistake you should -- you really dont need to rush. Go ahead have dessert. That last beer. Walk the dog whatever. Because rarely has a film shifted gears so radically as in Robert Zemeckis telling of the story of Philippe Petit the man who in 1974 strung a wire across the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center and walked across it. Repeatedly. Stopping to sit down along the way a few times.It was a remarkable feat as daring and thrilling as it was illegal. The story has been told before and well in James Marshs Oscar-winning 2008 documentary ""Man on Wire."" But Zemeckis takes a much lighter approach at first and in doing so nearly sinks the film before redeeming it in spectacular fashion.""The Walk"" begins with Petit played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt talking directly to the audience. Yes with a French accent which he pulls off well.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Five questions with Joseph Gordon-Levitt star of the new film ""The Walk."" Petit is going to walk us through his backstory which starts with him working as a street performer in France -- a magician acrobat and wire walker in theory but in actual practice he behaves like a clown. This annoys Annie (Charlotte Le Bon) the woman playing guitar and singing as Petit steals her audience but soon (like by the end of the day) she is smitten.In a dentists office Petit discovers his destiny when flipping through a magazine he sees a story about construction of the Twin Towers. Hes always looking for the best place to hang his wire and now hes found it. Annie is supportive and soon hes enlisting help from others like Jean-Louis (Clement Sibony) and Jean-Francois (Cesar Domboy); in a nice touch the latter is terrified of heights.AZCENTRALList of movies opening in fall 2015But Petits real help must come from his mentor Papa Rudy (Ben Kingsley) whom Petit met sneaking into a circus. Kingsley wildly overplays the role as he is wont to do but it fits right in with the tone of the film up to this point.That is not a compliment.Eventually of course Petit and the others (except Papa Rudy) must travel to the U.S. and this is when the story changes. A lengthy reconnaissance mission is called for as well as more help. The former lends itself to humor but not nearly as forced as what weve been subjected to so far. The latter arrives in the form of three men (Ben Schwartz Steve Valentine and James Badge Dale) who are persuaded to be a part of Petits ""artistic coup."" There are hurdles to clear along the way of course but its all just so much warm-up for Petit putting his foot on the wire.AZCENTRALThe Walk An IMAX 3D Experience (2015) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsAnd thats when the film becomes nearly transcendent. I saw it in 3D and strongly recommend it. The dizzying heights the birds flying by the clouds that lift -- its as immersive as a film can get (until technology allows for something more). Its thrilling and scary and monstrously impressive. Zemeckis is a master of using effects but his films sometimes dont live up to them (see ""Flight"" for the most egregious example or more to the point see it for the scene in which an airliner flies upside down over a neighborhood).""The Walk"" is different. The use of 3D in particular is so astonishing it practically wipes your memory of the silliness going on in France as Petit was learning his trade. Once Petit is on the wire he is free and the liberation is contagious.A question for Petit is whether it was worth it and the film leaves no doubt that it was. We might wonder the same thing about the film. Is it worth it? Ultimately it is.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

So director Robert Zemeckis deserves some slack for the Forrest Gumpiness of The Walk his big carnival ride depiction of Petits life. Ditto Joseph Gordon-Levitt whos already been ridiculed for his French accent even though his imitation of Petits exaggerated Parisian voice is spot-on. (The criticism stems solely from the fact that it is Joseph Gordon-Levitt speaking these lines; whether he really needed to be cast instead of a non-distracting French actor like Gaspard Ulliel or Louis Garrel is another conversation.) True to its protagonist the film opens with maximum cheese as Petit breaks the fourth wall and narrates from a location that we realize is the torch of the Statue of Liberty. As the movie flashes back to Petits childhood his apprenticeship with a circus showman (Ben Kingsley) and his romance with a cute street musician (Charlotte Le Bon) Zemeckis and cowriter Christopher Browne inflate the story with a dirigibles worth of hot air and whimsy. As in musicals where the act of singing is treated as commonplace the tone is artificial. We know were watching a prankster and were encouraged to play along with the con. One sequence is shot in black and white with only a dollop of color. In an early high-wire scene the pole slips from Petits hands and spears straight through the right lens of our 3-D glasses. Though its clear what Zemeckis is doing--embracing Petits fakery in order to match the supernaturalness of his stunt--The Walk starts to crackle once Petit reaches New York City and touches the World Trade Center which he does for the first time endearingly with his chin. The flights of fancy continue in the films middle stretch as he recruits a businessman in the South Tower (Steve Valentine) and an electronics salesman (James Badge Dale) as collaborators in his daredevil plot but the occasional hokum cannot cloud the stunning incandescent craftsmanship of the movies third act. The 17-minute wire-walking sequence is the most majestic simulation of a real event since the ship sinking in Titanic--a dazzling triumph of photorealistic digital effects which exhibits Zemeckis mastery of both CGI and pace. Though so much of what preceded it is histrionic the scene is marvelously unhurried almost dreamy taking its cues from Petit as it moves slowly and breathes calmly. Incredibly 17 minutes is only a third of the time that Petit spent on the wire in actuality but the sequence acquires the verisimilitude of real time. And real weight We somehow feel--you could even say experience--the wire bowing under his feet and detect the force of gravity tugging from 110 stories below. (Gordon-Levitt learned how to wire-walk for the role and the scene was filmed on an actual cable.) For its tranquility the central event in The Walk is the antipode of Saving Private Ryans chaos-filled attack on Normandy Beach. Indeed both sequences caused nausea in audience members while also making it easier to forgive the banalities elsewhere in their respective scripts. Zemeckis like Spielberg has been branded a big studio sentimentalist for about two-thirds of his career. And there are moments here like a digression where the shirtless Petit wakes in the middle of the night to doubt himself and act erratically that provide fodder for Zemeckis haters. But those are easily surpassed by the films grace notes--the prettiest of which occurs in an elevator shaft when Petit touches the hand of his sidekick (Cesar Domboy) whos terrified of heights--and its attention to detail from the poignantly rendered Manhattan skyline of 40 years ago to the rooftop sprocket wheel ominously spinning to signal an ascending elevator. No footage exists of Petits walk (there are only photographs) and with the intent of correcting that Zemeckis bought the rights to Petits story a decade ago--several years in fact before the release of 2008s Oscar-winning Man on Wire James Marshs beautiful lyrical melancholic documentary on the same subject. Marshs film is the better piece of pure movie poetry but comparing the two is a time waster. The thing that both movies crucially grasp is that a great part of whats so tearfully moving about Petits stunt is of course our connection to the site where he did it. Were he a manipulative Hollywood buffoon Zemeckis would never be able to resist sopping our heartstrings in ponds of 9/11 tears. When it came to judging The Walk this was a litmus test higher than Petits wire. But in its lovely last seconds the movie threads that very delicate needle. With an appropriately plaintive adieu--and mercifully for once no closing title cards--it eulogizes the Twin Towers without turning them into gravestones.

"The Walk more than just a stunt movie review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Walk more than just a stunt movie review Almost as audacious as Philippe Petits 1974 high-wire ""coup"" on the World Trade Center is The Walk Robert Zemeckiss dramatic screen retelling of the French daredevils feat.By Peter HowellMovie CriticTues. Sept. 29 2015The WalkStarring Joseph Gordon-Levitt Ben Kingsley Charlotte Le Bon and Clement Sibony. Directed by Robert Zemeckis. Opens Wednesday at GTA theatres. 123 minutes. PGAlmost as audacious as Philippe Petits 1974 high-wire ""coup"" on the World Trade Center is The Walk Robert Zemeckiss dramatic screen retelling of the French daredevils feat.There is already an excellent documentary account of the event James Marshs Oscar-winning Man on Wire from 2008. A fictionalized version seems superfluous especially with U.S. actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing Petit with an accent and manner suggesting a Gallic parody by a young Robin Williams. Article Continued BelowYet somehow The Walk succeeds in spite of its immoderation especially when the stunt is at hand -- in 3D IMAX no less -- which is so often the way of Zemeckis movies. The man who set Tom Hanks adrift and also globally trotting (Cast Away Forrest Gump) who had Denzel Washington flying drunk and upside down (Flight) and who turned Angelina Jolie into a cartoon siren (Beowulf) delights in extreme challenges and gilded lilies. Joseph Gordon-Levitt portrays Philippe Petite in a scene from The Walk.  (Courtesy of Sony Pictures / AP)  The ""why"" question posed and answered at the outset by Gordon-Levitts Petit narrating from atop the Statue of Liberty in just one of the films many cornball inventions also serves to justify this film which Zemeckis and co-screenwriter Christopher Browne loosely base on Petits own accounts.""Cest la vie"" Petit cries as flashbacks reveal him as a brash juggler and wire walker in a Disneyfied Paris dazzling tourists while at the same time wooing a winsome busker (Canadas Charlotte Le Bon).Seeking a life challenge Petit begins planning ""the artistic coup of the century"" walking a steel cable stretched between the north and south towers of New Yorks spanking new World Trade Center then nearing completion. (The foreshadowing of the Sept. 11 tragedy is thankfully minimal.)His accomplices are a Looney Tunes version of Central Casting. They include a grumpy old circus patriarch (Ben Kingsley attempting French with a Czech accent); a sexy photographer (Clement Sibony); a fast-talking electronics salesman (James Badge Dale) and a wild-eyed inside man (Steve Valentine a Salvador Dali look-alike).Its easy to buy into this absurd scenario because Gordon-Levitt likewise goes all in for his poetic protagonist -- and also because its the 1970s man when the thirst for rebellion was as real as building security was lax. Rolling eyes turn to popping ones when the time comes for Petit to begin what will prove to be multiple crossings and dramatic gestures having overcome obstacles both real and imagined. Zemeckis is truly in his realm as a cinematic conjuror when Petit steps onto the wire stretched 1350 vertiginous feet above Manhattan leaving us for the next 30 minutes agape and wondering where our cynicism landed along with our stomachs.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

The Walk Robert Zemeckis 3D IMAX drama about what the heist-like stunt and the assorted personalities who helped Petit pull it off is more of an Oscar long-shot. But by the nature of movie-making it does one thing the doc never could - make you see what Petit saw when he stood on a cable more than 1300 feet above the ground. Indeed if you saw it on a double bill with Everest (two 3D big-screen movies that remarkably have no superheroes or aliens) it should either cure your fear of heights or make it worse. At ground level The Walk is entertainment as light as the street performances Petit used to give in Paris. Director Robert Zemeckis (whos been making pretty good films again since turning away from his CG animation obsession) doesnt burden the movie or the stunt with any deep metaphors. Indeed for The Walk to work it really only needs to do two things. First Joseph Gordon-Levitt must convince us he is a Frenchman. Which he does - unless youre French in which case Im told he doesnt though he speaks fluently enough. Second the movie must get you to a point where you can look at the World Trade Center towers and feel something other than anger or sadness. And there too it manages to communicate Petits awe and humbling sense of challenge - as if the buildings were a Mount Everest made of concrete and steel. And in the last act you even feel that sense of awe spread among New Yorkers some of whom only really paid attention to the boxy buildings for the first time when they saw somebody risking his life over them. Considering this is a Hollywood movie made for an English-speaking audience it doesnt bother me so much that the early scenes in Paris sometimes seem like they were shot at Epcot Center. The ""meet cute"" scene between juggler Petit and his street-singer girlfriend Annie (Quebec actress Charlotte Le Bon) plays out more as a means of moving the plot forward with a wink and Gallic insouciance than as a depiction of a real relationship. Petits fractious relationship with legendary acrobat Papa Rudy (Ben Kingsley) seems more real with less screen time. Showmanship versus hubris the role of the audience when theyre together it seems like the only time the script asks ""Why are you doing this?"" The rest of the first two acts is a roll-call of conspirators an admiring photographer a non-English speaker with a fear of heights an entrepreneur a couple of stoner Americans and a French expat living in New York. But this is a movie where past is truly prologue. Once all the canards are in a row excitement follows - particularly from the day-of close calls and subterfuges by which Petit arranges to be on the roof with gear that can be strung to a support team hundreds of feet across a veritable canyon. At this point The Walk becomes a first-rate caper movie with a thrilling finish that cant help but move you (if you havent covered your eyes).

TriStar PicturesPhilippe Petit (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) gets ready to carefully maneuver along the space between the twin towers in The Walk.(Photo TriStar Pictures)The Walk is one very stomach-churning vertigo-inducing argument for the big-screen movie experience.Director Robert Zemeckis tale (1/2 out of four; rated PG; opening in IMAX theaters Wednesday nationwide Oct. 9) is an earnest fictional recollection of Philippe Petits infamous high-wire stroll between New York Citys twin towers in 1974. While venturing near hokeyness for the first two acts its climax -- especially in full IMAX glory -- is both a visual spectacle and a loving tribute to the fallen World Trade Center.Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars as the Parisian street performer whose daily life of juggling and being a mime stems from a longtime love for performance and entertaining people. Its not just putting a smile on their faces -- he has to artistically salute them in his own way as well.USA TODAYJoseph Gordon-Levitt takes The Walk on wireLike a theme-park attraction of sorts Philippe breaks the fourth wall from the top of the Statue of Liberty narrating his journey from having the idea to walk between the twin towers while waiting in a dentists office to meeting his loyal confidante and muse Annie (Charlotte Le Bon). They recruit a gang of accomplices that ultimately keep him grounded about his mission while also accomplishing it.But thats all a warm-up act to the main event Philippes death-defying walk more than 1300 feet above wowed bystanders. Zemeckis faithfully re-creates the towers making the most of special effects and IMAX technology to fashion what it would look like to be as crazy and passionate as this man who takes his art to the next level.The camera looks down much of the time and whirls around Philippes view so realistically that those with a fear of heights may feel a bit squeamish. Its totally worth keeping your eyes open and risking uneasiness for the immersive experience and the majesty of the New York skyline as Philippe moves Zen-like back and forth on the wire before the police inevitably show up.USA TODAYJoseph Gordon-Levitt draws parallels between Petit SnowdenWhat could have easily been a cloying tribute to the World Trade Center is classily done but still touching. Zemeckis and Christopher Brownes script is ham-fisted however with Philippes declarations of destiny -- braving certain doom is a tad more convincing with his actions rather than words.That said Gordon-Levitt sells the honesty of his statements. He brandishes a thick and unconvincing accent but otherwise captures Petits adventurous spirit. Ben Kingsley also has a noteworthy cameo as Petits impatient instructor on the high wire.The Oscar-winning 2008 documentary Man on Wire better tells the story of the real Petits quest -- and features the artist himself. But for those who want to feel as if theyre 110 stories up and living in the clouds Hollywood does its job conjuring movie magic with a breathtaking Walk to remember. 102 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1FA5f1F",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/09/29/the-walk-movie-review/72937810/,200,thewalk34,thewalk,usatoday
"The Walk review Joseph Gordon-Levitts high-wire act - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies The Walk review High-wire act falls short of documentary The Walk Sony Pictures Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Philippe Petite in ""The Walk."" Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Philippe Petite in ""The Walk."" (Sony Pictures) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Look up in the sky Man on wire If only.If only for the benefit of other filmmakers exploring the same material we could un-see a great film and clear our memories of it. One such film is the 2008 documentary ""Man on Wire"" James Marshs account of what happened the morning of Aug. 7 1974 when French aerialist Philippe Petit wire-walked between the twin towers of the World Trade Center. Eight times he crossed that wire 1350 feet above the streets of lower Manhattan. The act of trespassing was not legal and involved all sorts of disguises accomplices dodges and ""spy work"" as Petit referred to it later in his book ""To Reach the Clouds"" upon which the new film ""The Walk"" was based.Marshs documentary won the Oscar for best documentary and it deserved more -- a best picture nomination at least. So. Where does that leave ""The Walk"" director Robert Zemeckis fancy fictionalized docudrama version of the grandest act of poetic terrorism ever committed on American soil? I cannot say how Id feel about ""The Walk"" if Id never seen ""Man on Wire"" because I did see ""Man on Wire"" and I cant un-see it. I love it. I can only say ""The Walk"" struck me as an honorable good try of an also-ran though with some lovely things to offer especially when the preamble and preparations and backstage dramas wind down and Joseph Gordon-Levitt who portrays Petit takes that first step.The script by Zemeckis and Christopher Browne positions Gordon-Levitt (sporting a heavily worn French accent) as narrator and host of his own story speaking to us from the torch of the Statue of Liberty. In predominantly black-and-white flashbacks Paris street performer Petit plies his slack-rope skills wherever he can elude the cops long enough to gather a crowd. Then at the dentist one day he sees in a magazine a picture of the soon-to-be-completed World Trade Center. An idea flowers. The Walk (Trailer) Trailer for ""The Walk."" Sept. 30 2015 (Screenplay) Trailer for ""The Walk."" Sept. 30 2015 (Screenplay) See more videos In cheery bold and bright tones ""The Walk"" follows Petit as he enlists his colleagues including his lover played by Charlotte Le Bon on the adventure of a lifetime. While they case the towers in New York Petits circus mentor played by Ben Kingsley wonders back home if his prize pupil will ever meet his ambitions. Petit did of course.The film gets better as it goes and the last half-hour (especially in 3-D on an Imax screen) is nearly everything it should be scary visually momentous meticulously realized. The runup however settles for too little and too much simultaneously. Zemeckis keeps throwing things (juggling pins etc.) at the screen in the early sequences and while the storybook colors and tones of ""The Walk"" are designed to appeal to all ages often the film simply feels pushy and insecure. Its disappointing particularly in the wake of ""Flight"" Zemeckis previous and excellent picture. There the directors penchant for digital moviemaking tools and tricks was put to sparing and hugely effective use. In ""The Walk"" the climactic stroll of the title gets so much visual competition en route the impact is muffled. ""Stop trying so hard Do nothing"" Kingsley roars at Gordon-Levitt at one point early on schooling him in the art of the proper bow before an audience. Zemeckis couldve used the same advice at least as a check on his impulse to dazzle us every second instead of building incrementally to a breathtaking climax.

This is irresistible movie material the lead-up to the wire-walk has all the elements of a heist with Petit (here played by an elfin Joseph Gordon-Levitt with a thick French accent) as the fearless or at least highly determined leader of a loosely assembled group. The fun here is that so many things could go wrong for Petits plan at any moment -- and things in fact sometimes do go wrong in ways both expected and unexpected -- but its in what goes right for our hero that ""The Walk"" finds both its spine and its heart. See Video Joseph Gordon-Levitts The Walk Gets Thrilling 5-Minute IMAX Trailer Levitt narrates this movie directly to the camera from an aerie in the Statue of Libertys torch with the Twin Towers directly behind him as if this space up in the air were his hard-won territory. The weakest parts of the movie are the early scenes in France where we see Petit honing his skills as a street performer and picking up girlfriend Annie (Charlotte Le Bon) who is first glimpsed singing Leonard Cohens ""Suzanne."" The dialogue in these courtship scenes is old-fashioned boilerplate (""You dont give up do you?"" Annie asks him at one point as he keeps pressing his suit) but that lack of specificity retroactively feels intentional as the film goes on. Those French scenes in ""The Walk"" are done in that sanitized and vaguely creepy visual style that has been a hallmark of Zemeckiss animated work in recent years complete with color elements popping out of a black-and-white frame. The visual unreality continues when Petit is up on the wire learning his craft but Zemeckis keeps a steady smart and gently humane focus on the people in his story; once the plot moves to New York the effects begin to improve dramatically. Whats fascinating about ""The Walk"" is that the 3-D puts you out on a limb with Petit while it also reassures you that this is just a movie or an act or a performance. The results are often scary (dont be surprised if your palms sweat for him) but the camerawork remains as impressively levelheaded as Petit had to be during his walk. ""Take the first three steps arrogantly as if you were invincible and you will die"" says Petits mentor Papa Rudy (Ben Kingsley) a man who holds a cigarette in a holder and gives much sage and fatherly advice. Theres a beautifully acted scene here where Kingsleys Papa Rudy stares directly and lovingly at Petit and lets him know that while he doesnt quite understand why Petit needs to take the risk of doing this clandestine Twin Towers wire-walk he understands it in his heart. This brief interaction is just one of several intimate personal moments in ""The Walk"" that make it more than just the story of a male adventurer and his adventure. Also Read Why Early IMAX Runs for Everest and The Walk Could Be Hollywood Game-Changers Perhaps the films deepest bond is the relationship that develops between Petit and Jean-Francois (Cesar Domboy) a math teacher with a serious fear of heights. At one point Petit and Jean-Francois (who asks Petit to call him Jeff) are stuck for a very long time on an iron beam above an elevator shaft with a sheer drop down to the ground. It has been established that Jeff is so afraid of heights that he begins to shake when they are standing just one flight above the lobby of the South Tower so it really means something when Petit looks Jeff straight in the eyes and Zemeckis cuts to a close shot of Petit putting his hand on Jeffs trembling hand to steady him. Its a simple sequence that nonetheless conveys a touching level of trust and intimacy. In the final hours before the walk Annie is grounded at street level with her binoculars seemingly out of the adventure and Zemeckis calls attention to her exclusion in a way that directors of movies like this seldom do. Jean-Pierre (James Badge Dale) a New York shop worker whose gift of gab has been a key element in sneaking Petit into the towers sees Annie down on the street and says to her ""I wonder if he even knows youre down here."" At first it might seem like Jean-Pierre is hitting on her but hes actually just pointing something out that she seems to already know. Also Read Joseph Gordon-Levitts The Walk First Project for Create Advertising Groups New Virtual Reality Division There are many enjoyable close calls and head-shaking details in this story like the fact that Petit went ahead with the walk even though he had stepped on a nail a few weeks earlier. (The moment when we see his foot stepping through the nail here is maybe the most realistically and harrowingly three-dimensional in the film.) The walk itself is presented in as exciting and detailed a fashion as could be wished to the point where it becomes a rare mystical experience. The way that Jeff overcomes his extreme fear of heights to be Petits key point man is so sensitively and believably drawn here that it feels genuinely inspirational and heartwarming. But Zemeckis insists also on showing the human cost of the adventure in Petits ultimate isolation from everyone around him so that he can be up in the clouds. When Zemeckis decides to pull on the heartstrings he manages to do it without offending the more hardboiled among us with some tact grace and human understanding. ""The Walk"" is that rare movie that might please practically everyone from viewers just looking for a thrill to those who might enjoy a story that sounds like a tall tale but winds up being discreetly poignant.

Gordon-Levitt studied with Petit in preparation for the role and has said that to his own surprise he was able to master the basics of wirewalking in just eight days. In The Walk he moves like a natural. When his Petit finally gets to take that famous aerial stroll -- picking his way along that impossibly narrow cable in soft barely-there leather slippers that wouldnt snap a twig in the forest -- hes both fawn and faun sure of his place in nature and the universe. The Walk in its last half at least is a dazzling piece of work particularly in 3-D; even so its most luminous effect is an actor. It could have maybe should have been called Something in the Way He Moves.You should be forewarned that the first half of The Walk -- covering Petits early years in Paris as a wirewalker-in-training and detailing his crazy-passionate plan to traverse the air between the twin towers which were still under construction at the time -- is beleaguered by whimsy so lets get that part over with Petit unicycling through Paris Petit juggling Petit learning the highs and lows of wirewalking from Ben Kingsleys Czech-emigre acrobat Papa Rudy Petit meeting Annie the cutie-pie street singer who will become his girlfriend (Shes played by Charlotte Le Bon delicate as a macaron and with about as much bite.) Even during the snoozy parts Zemeckis uses 3-D effects cleverly At home in Paris Petit working out what he would come to call ""le coup"" balances a little paper man on a string stretched between two wine bottles -- the image pops in front of us though the earnest delight and undiluted optimism on Gordon-Levitts face is the real pleasure here.Film Details The Walk RatingPG GenreDrama Running Time123 min. More Info Trailer Yet all of that is just preamble to the great part of The Walk which begins when Petit arrives in New York with a three-person crew Clement Sibonys dashing and passionate photographer Jean-Louis Cesar Domboys charming acrophobic Jean-Francois and loyal girlfriend Annie. Stateside Petit picks up a few other accomplices most notably James Badge Dales swaggering French-speaking J.P. and proceeds to fine-tune his plan which involves figuring out a way to run a cable between the towers without being detected by police or building officials.The Walk is dazzling but its most luminous effect is an actor.If youve seen James Marshs extraordinary 2008 documentary Man on Wire you already know how Petit did this and how ingenious his solution was. (Hint It begins with an arrow and a length of fishing line.) But The Walk isnt superfluous just because Man on Wire already exists; if anything the two are fine companion pieces each filling in tiles of different texture and color in the mosaic of Petits story. Zemeckiss approach is admittedly a little weird in places The Walk is framed by sequences in which Gordon-Levitts Petit perched up high on the Statue of Liberty right near the torch and with the twin towers gleaming in the background addresses the camera directly in ze kind of French accent Americans love to make fun of (even if we secretly love it). Gordon-Levitt is spry and casual enough to make it work but its still a little corny; I sometimes wonder longingly where the director of sharply funny pictures like Used Cars and Death Becomes Her has gone.Related StoriesWho Says Art Films Arent Funny? This Years New York Film Festival Is a BallNYFF In Lanthimoss Mad The Lobster Its Mate or DevolveNYFF The Witness Asks Whether 38 New Yorkers Truly Ignored the Murder of Kitty GenoveseBut if any director knows his way around 3-D its Zemeckis He has been working out the kinks in this mode of filmmaking for years and even if he had to torture us with The Polar Express in the process The Walk (almost) makes up for it. He comes through in the clutch beautifully dramatizing both the preparation process and ultimately the walk itself. Petit performed his ""coup"" early on the morning of August 7 1974 having laid the groundwork the night before We watch as he and his cohorts smuggle the necessary equipment up to the towers roofs -- the milky nighttime light renders the whole scene otherworldly. Zemeckis details with fascinating precision the mechanics of stretching that cable -- this isnt just a film about dreaming big dreams but about working out 1000 little problems along the way.Predictably though the greatest moment a gloriously protracted one is the walk itself. When Gordon-Levitts Petit finally steps onto that cable the world below -- a dream version of 1970s New York when crime stopped for at least a few minutes and peoples polyester clothes actually looked sort of OK -- drops away leaving only air and clouds and a guy so light on his feet it seems he could almost blow away. But hes really incredibly sturdy and tensile. He makes his way across that cable once twice -- with cops waiting to arrest him on either side he ends up traversing it a total of eight times. At one point Petit kneels on the cable saluting -- as Gordon-Levitt explains in voiceover -- the wire his audience and these two ugly-beauty buildings. A little later he takes a break by stretching along the cable on his back like a cat on a windowsill. Zemeckiss 3-D maneuvering (plus Dariusz Wolskis camerawork) makes us feel suspended too If you have trouble with heights bring a friend with you to the theater though as you watch the feat itself you may find yourself laughing more than cringing. Gordon-Levitt playing a man whos executing the most dangerous feat of his life radiates a kind of Zen joy. To hold your breath is to try to stop time; Gordon-Levitt is breathing every moment moving forward with time not against it.Zemeckis ends The Walk with an elegy to the World Trade Center that some will find corny. Weve all seen enough hypersentimental twin-tower images often flanked by soft-focus American-flag imagery to last eleven lifetimes. But if you lived in New York while those buildings stood -- and if you were here on the day they fell -- you know that their absence is actually an unerasable presence no matter how many new skyscrapers spring up around their airspace. When Gordon-Levitts Petit speaks of them its with the tenderness youd use in reflecting on a lost lover. One little French guys dream of stringing a cable between these two boxy unloved wonders and -- good God -- walking it is part of what the twin towers were and are. Theyre ghost buildings dissolved into the very air of New York -- we still breathe it in.The Walk Directed by Robert Zemeckis Sony Pictures Opens September 30 Directed by Robert Zemeckis. Written by Christopher Browne and Robert Zemeckis. Based on the book To Reach the Clouds by Philippe Petit.

"The Walk earns its keep with spectacular third act | The Big Story Skip to main content Latest News The Conversation The Walk earns its keep with spectacular third act By LINDSEY BAHR Sep. 28 2015 226 PM EDT Can a great third act make a great film? Conventional wisdom would say no. Its silly to spell out but beginnings and middles are important too.But if youre going to nail one section the end isnt a bad place to start. The audience leaves invigorated and in a best case scenario has already forgotten the slog it took to get there.""The Walk"" a fictionalized rendering of Philippe Petits 1974 high-wire stroll between the World Trade Center towers doesnt entirely disprove the rule but it certainly makes a seductive case.Director Robert Zemeckis and cinematographer Dariusz Wolski have made a truly extraordinary and breathtaking 40 minutes of cinema preceded by a mostly forgettable cloyingly whimsical hour and change.The stunt which the gang refers to as ""the coup"" is one for the cinematic ages. Zemeckis and Wolski take the camera to unprecedented angles to make you feel like you are really standing between the 110 story towers. Its an undeniable sweaty-palmed thrill walking above the clouds with Petit (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) full of tension and triumph.The final sequence could have been enough for a film but ""The Walk"" is more conventional than it might seem. It languishes for too long on origins of Petits obsession with wire-walking and the high rise towers playing up his quirkiness and eccentricities for whimsy not the story.The beginning is shot like a fever dream of top hats circus tents and unicycles. And of course there are the requisite underdeveloped characters -- a curmudgeonly mentor (Ben Kingsley) and supportive girlfriend (Charlotte Le Bon) -- to accompany him along the way.Gordon-Levitt sporting fake blue eyes and a thick French accent embraces the manic showiness and near sociopathy of Petit -- an artist with complete tunnel vision. Its an interesting all-out performance that still doesnt go much deeper than surface level. Thats because the film would rather treat this real life oddity like a fanciful fairy tale. Everyone seems like a character out of ""Alice in Wonderland.""Structurally the film chooses to let Petit narrate his own story literally from the top of the Statue of Liberty with the towers gleaming in the background. Though most likely know the outcome this post game voiceover strips away some of the inherent drama and looks fairly cheesy too.Thats why its such a relief when the coup begins in earnest. Everything takes a turn for the dramatic -- even the music.Beyond the walk itself the joy of the third act comes not from trying to comprehend the why but in documenting the how of it all. The energy even gets an adrenaline boost when James Badge Dale enters the frame as J.P. a magnetic French-speaking New Yorker who brings an authentic levity and vitality to the film not a minute too soon.Clement Sibony stands out in the supporting cast as Petits closest ally and Cesar Domboy is fun too as a math whiz whos deathly afraid of heights. Le Bon though lovely and restrained gets eaten by the over-the-topness of everything else. The band of weirdos trope starts to wear thin too even though the caricatures are somewhat true to real life.""The Walk"" isnt nearly as elegant grand or informative as James Marshs 2008 documentary masterpiece ""Man on Wire"" but that doesnt make it redundant or unnecessary --""The Walk"" serves its cinematic purpose by showing you something that youve never seen before from perspectives that seem as impossible as the stunt itself. Zemeckis just chose for too long to luxuriate in the fantasy of it all when the reality was more than enough.""The Walk"" a Sony Pictures Entertainment release is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association of America for ""thematic elements involving perilous situations and for some nudity language brief drug references and smoking.""

A quarter of a mile above the earth with nothing but a thin braided cable between him and a gum-splattered New York pavement Philippe Petit strolled between the Twin Towers. And a city held its breath. Theres already been Petits book about the experience and a childrens book and an award-winning documentary ""Man on Wire."" Now comes the feature ""The Walk"" and it is as it should be a slight mischievous light-footed film full of imagery. Director Robert Zemeckis was distracted a long time by CGI effects giving us a cartoon ""A Christmas Carol"" ""Beowulf"" and the unwittingly creepy ""The Polar Express."" But he was always one of the best image-makers in the business and as he showed in ""Cast Away"" and more recently in ""Flight"" hes able to use those new tricks to tell real stories. Hes also always been like his good friend Steven Spielberg an unashamed optimist. So Petits story is the perfect choice for both his visual skills and his personal philosophy. Smartly he begins the film as if it were a silent comedy a sort of ""Safety Last"" with a Gallic accent and Petit - played with whimsy and winning charm by Joseph Gordon-Levitt - unicycling his way around Paris. Disinherited by his parents (and often criticized by his mentor a circus performer played by Ben Kingsley) he works on the streets and lives a bit in his own world of fantasy. With the Eiffel Tower looming a little-too-perfectly in the background just the right sort of artistes and bohemians popping up in every scene its the sort of movie-Paris that Gene Kelly would feel at home in. And Zemeckis is at ease too switching from black-and-white to color infusing every scene with playful verve. Adding a great deal of playfulness to those scenes - and the whole movie - is Gordon-Levitt. Some critics have already mocked his Franco-American accent (he narrates the entire story from a perch on the Statue of Libertys torch) but his fluent French itself sounds fine to me and he has just the right impish- yet-slightly arrogant approach for Petit. Its when he gets the idea to string a line from tower to tower and we leave Paris that the films fun fades a bit. The faintly whimsical fantastic camera style disapppears; the scenes crowd with corny New York ""types"" most spouting ridiculous facial hair. And of course planning a thing is never as lovely as dreaming it. This is the middle of the film and it drags. But then eventually the walk begins. And Zemeckis puts us right up there with Petit - in 3D and all-encompassing IMAX - as he steps into the clouds. And that at its best is what this movie is - not virtual reality but a virtual fantasy as an artist takes what all art is - a high-wire high-risk act - and makes that literal. And then asks us to join him. What this movie is not - thank heavens - is a ponderous meditation on faded innocence with mournful final titles at the end or the real-life Petit reappearing to tell us how he feels today. Theres no need to go into that. We all know what happened to those heaven-reaching towers. The film never reminds us of what was lost. Except perhaps in its idealization of what used to be a 1974 New York where artists lived on love the druggies were as harmless as Cheech and Chong and every police officer was a benevolent beat cop. Of course thats the films biggest fantasy. It isnt really true to life not even the best of life back then. But like the man said - isnt it pretty to think so? Ratings note The film contains brief comic nudity and a few strong words. The Walk (PG) Sony (123 min.) Directed by Robert Zemeckis. With Joseph Gordon-Levitt Ben Kingsley.

TWITTER Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars as Philippe Petit in Robert Zemeckis virtuoso cinematic re-creation of the French high-wire walkers 1974 Twin Towers stunt. Robert Zemeckis The Walk is all about ""the walk."" That is to say the movie comes to dazzling life in its spectacular final 40 minutes or so when Philippe Petit played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt saunters out on a cable and gives us a vertiginous view of the French tightrope walkers 1974 aerial feat as he tiptoed across the clouds between the towers of the World Trade Center. Harnessing the wizardry of 3D Imax to magnify the sheer transporting wonder the you-are-there thrill of the experience the films payoff more than compensates for a lumbering setup laden with cloying voiceover narration and strained whimsy. Zemeckis delivery of such a sustained money shot -- literally breathtaking stomach-churning sweat-inducing and exhilarating -- should ensure solid numbers for Sony. American audiences in particular will respond to the unspoken coda of the Twin Towers destruction which gives the film an emotional resonance that might otherwise have been more muted. Sharing screenwriting credit with newcomer Christopher Browne Zemeckis adapted the true story from Petits memoir To Reach the Clouds. The director goes back to his Forrest Gump playbook by having his protagonist narrate the story every painstaking step of the way. This proves a big hurdle as Gordon-Levitts mop-top Philippe opens with some cringe-inducing direct-address musing on the obvious question of ""Why? Pourquoi?"" in a cheesy French accent. The clunky framing device gets worse when the camera pans back to find him perched in the Statue of Libertys torch although the digital re-creation of early-70s lower Manhattan he surveys is indeed impressive. Read more The Walk and Bridge of Spies Bring Oscar Buzz to NYFF In his gripping 2008 documentary account of Petits career-defining act of subversive performance art Man on Wire director James Marsh made no excuses for the egomaniacal side of his daredevil subject. Zemeckis tries to get around that by depicting Petit as a cute imp who pedals away on a unicycle when hes kicked out of his home by his father. But in Gordon-Levitts self-regarding performance the character is borderline obnoxious right up until he acquires some vulnerability by virtue of the void stretching out beneath him. The film also works too hard at injecting charm into Petits backstory not to mention finding contrived reasons for him to speak English with the band of ""accomplices"" he assembles in Paris as he prepares for his coup. The idea of a Frenchman obsessed with conquering America is subliminally planted early via not one but three French-language versions of jukebox classics -- ""Sugar Sugar"" ""Black Is Black"" and ""These Boots Are Made for Walkin."" And Philippes guitar-strumming sweetheart Annie (Charlotte Le Bon) is introduced crooning Leonard Cohens ""Suzanne"" en francais. Zemeckis uses the jazzy strains of Alan Silvestris score to instill the feel of a crime caper or a heist movie but for much of the running time conflict remains absent. Photographer Jean-Louis (Clement Sibony) signs on to help also enlisting Jean-Francois (Cesar Domboy) a math whiz who speaks little English and is terrified of heights. The most significant embellishment to the story as chronicled in Man on Wire is Philippes mentor Papa Rudy (Ben Kingsley) the patriarch of a funambulist dynasty whose gruff exterior veils the heart of a twinkly-eyed softie. Only when the action moves to New York does the film shift gears and gain lasting traction. A handful of American accomplices are brought on board notably Barry Greenhouse (Steve Valentine) an insurance broker with an office high up in one of the World Trade Center towers and smart-talking electronics salesman J.P. (James Badge Dale). But this is a movie in which the characters and their dialogue remain secondary to the complicated logistics of their illegal undertaking. And unsurprisingly for a filmmaker like Zemeckis who has shown a defining fascination with technological magic its the focus on the specifics -- research planning rigging setbacks and lucky breaks -- that finally tightens the storytelling grip. Working with cinematographer Dariusz Wolski and a crack visual effects team the director puts us 110 stories off the ground and dares us to look down. Despite a preordained outcome that pretty much nixes any element of surprise he builds suspense into the placement of the cable and its strategic support wires the last-minute defection of jittery team members the appearance of security guards and the more surreal introduction of a ""mysterious visitor"" who appears on the rooftop at the eleventh hour like some kind of brooding Don Draper stepping into a dream. The movie truly soars the minute Philippe steps out on that wire amplifying its awe factor as a crowd gathers on the street below to stare up in amazement. Wolskis camera swoops like a bird traveling the distance of the towers in both directions giving us Petits point of view as well as hovering above him. It may fumble the preamble but The Walk works where it counts most creating a spectacle of balletic beauty out of an act that otherwise remains inscrutable to the screenwriters. Read more NYFF How The Walk Director Robert Zemeckis Shot Joseph Gordon-Levitts ""Painful"" High-Wire Scenes Of course none of this is great news for the actors including Gordon-Levitt. Despite the actors intense physicality and manic energy both the character and performance remain constricted by a script that tells rather than explores. ""I am mad. I am insane. I am totally crazy"" admits Philippe in a moment of typically bald self-analysis that precludes psychological complexity. The film also glosses over the evaporation of his bond with Annie and Jean-Louis immediately after the coup sacrificing some of the poignancy that Marsh summoned in Man on Wire. Zemeckis does emphasize the point that at the time New Yorkers were ambivalent about the towers that so radically altered the Manhattan skyline crediting Petits captivating stunt with engendering affection for the twin steel-and-glass monoliths as construction neared completion. The choice to allude only obliquely to their disappearance after the September 2001 terrorist attacks via a somber fade in the closing shot shows welcome restraint in a movie whose final-act achievements erase the shortcomings of its belabored buildup.

In ""The Walk"" Robert Zemeckis dares audiences to look down zooming fast as gravity past 110 stories from the top of the World Trade Center to the expectant faces in the crowd below. A quarter of a mile above daredevil high-wire artist Philippe Petit (as played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) soft-shoes between New York Citys two tallest buildings in a breathtaking stunt the lunatic Frenchman believes could be ""the most audacious work of art that has ever been done."" For a man whose name literally means ""little"" Petit sure talks a big game. Luckily Zemeckis shares his gift for hyperbole and together they re-create the wild dream as only cinema can giving audiences a thrilling 3D all-angles view of an experience that until now only one man on Earth could claim to have lived. Ultimately its commercial fate will depend on word of mouth as a New York Film Festival kickoff and nine-day Imax opening stretch inspire audiences to talk the ""The Walk."" What Zemeckis delivers here is an entirely different brand of spectacle from what audiences have come to expect from recent studio tentpoles sharing a true story so incredible it literally must be seen to be believed as opposed to imaginary feats full of impossible CG creatures. Speaking of tentpoles ""The Walk"" takes its cues from the circus where 8-year-old Philippe first laid eyes on a tightrope act and from which his flamboyant performance style eventually sprung with the coaching of possibly Czech circus honcho Papa Rudy (Ben Kingsley sporting a wild Europudding accent worthy of ""The Rooms"" Tommy Wiseau). Gordon-Levitt was always going to be a strange choice to play Philippe Petit a hyper-kinetic and highly gesticulative showman with impish blue eyes wild orange hair and a thick French accent -- none of them qualities that audiences associate with the brooding star. Even in ""(500) Days of Summer"" he displays a touch of the melancholy though he does earn points for commitment going to the trouble of delivering a significant portion of his dialogue in French. Still resemblance matters since the 1974 Trade Center coup has made Petit an international celebrity of sorts his story known by children (a significant percentage of the PG-rated films intended audience) and retold in James Marshs terrific 2008 documentary ""Man on Wire."" Whatever one thinks of Gordon-Levitts weird wig and contacts the physical aspects of his performance do impress as he adopts the lithe catlike moves of a professional funambulist -- and the attitude of a flip French artiste. Say what you will about the accent but Zemeckis and co-writer Christopher Browne have captured Petits voice -- the real honest-to-God way he expresses himself -- and by channeling that the actor successfully wins us over from the outset hanging out in the Statue of Libertys torch. From this high perch he narrates ""The Walk"" banishing the word ""death"" from his vocabulary while enjoying a clear view of the Twin Towers that dwarfed lower Manhattan until that fateful day in 2001. Of course no film can touch on these landmarks without conjuring memories of their tragic collapse though ""The Walk"" reminds us that while New Yorkers still bond over the question ""Where were you on 9/11?"" a quarter century earlier before the South Tower was even finished witnesses to Petits walk were forever transformed by what they saw. (That very notion inspired Colum McCann to write his brilliant tapestry novel ""Let the Great World Spin"" which revolves around Petits high-wire act and in the authors words ""the ordinary people on the street the ones who walked a tightrope just one inch off the ground."") Few filmmakers have accomplished more seemingly impossible feats onscreen than Zemeckis and here the ""Forrest Gump"" helmer again proves his magicians ability to blend character and technology in such a way that virtuoso style springs organically from the material itself. There are moments in ""The Walk"" where the camera does impossible things whether hovering above Philippes head as he balances some 1300 feet off the ground or peering through an advertisement torn from a French magazine upon which Philippe has doodled a thin line between the not-yet-built Trade Center towers. Philippe sees the world differently and that alone makes him an infectious protagonist. He carries a small length of red cord in his pocket holding it up to distant landmarks to imagine a wire suspended there. After an early failure that ended with him belly-flopping off his cable into a shallow lake Philippe passed a wire between the twin belfries of Notre-Dame Cathedral and got himself arrested for walking it. His performances may be victimless crimes but they are crimes nonetheless and the fact that Philippe and his crew must plan the World Trade Center coup in secret lends it much of its suspense. After all theyre defying not just gravity but the laws of polite society as well. Much of what made ""Man on Wire"" so thrilling was the fact that Marsh had approached Petits story like a caper film. Though Zemeckis follows a more linear trajectory -- spending the better part of the pokey first hour in Paris where Philippe falls for street musician Annie (saucer-eyed Canadian actress Charlotte Le Bon) and enlists her photographer friend Jean-Louis (Clement Sibony) -- ""The Walk"" shares the white-knuckle sense that the World Trade Center performance must be planned and executed with the precision of a bank heist a sensibility reflected in Alan Silvestris light-string score which alternates between insistent and inspiring as the suspense level requires. We see Philippe forever the clown don an elaborate series of disguises as he and his friends case the joint -- a job made considerably easier after stepping on a nail forces him to use crutches even if the foot injury is sure to complicate the stunt itself. Bringing three accomplices over from France Philippe recruits a handful of Americans including wild-mustachioed Steve Valentine as their inside man and James Badge Dale as a slick electronics salesman. Philippe may not be short on charisma but Dale gets to do the fancy talking -- and steals nearly every scene hes in -- whenever theyre trying to hide their French accents. While Gallic buddy Jean-Louis takes the North Tower Zemeckis follows Philippe and his acrophobic friend Jeff (Cesar Domboy) infiltrate the South one. As the building is not yet open to the public its work-site hazards are every bit as unsafe as an under-construction Death Star. Zemeckis can get a little carried away at moments like these indulging a ""Vertigo""-like fantasy in which Jeff goes spinning off into the open elevator shaft where Philippe and Jeff duck to hide from a passing security guard -- though its helpful to remember that hes playing to his widest potential audience since ""The Polar Express"" and hes trying to psyche the kiddies up for the main attraction once the guard leaves and the men can finally step out onto the observation deck. Oddly the rooftop scenes yield some of the movies least cinematic footage a bit too obviously shot on ground-level soundstages (though real-life details keep things lively as in an amusing bit where Philippe inexplicably strips off all his clothes to retrieve the arrow shot between the towers). Maybe Zemeckis is just saving his mojo for the moment when the wire is finally suspended between the buildings and Philippe is ready to take his first step out into the void. At any rate he shows little interest in the pics few subplots and hasty resolution from this point forward. How long can you hold your breath? For the next 17 minutes Philippe is free as a bird -- as is d.p. Dariusz Wolskis often-virtual camera occasionally relying on performance-capture and other visual-effects tricks that he and Zemeckis innovated during their ugly but ultimately useful all-CG phase. As Philippe moves back and forth between the towers pausing to sit look down and taunt the police officers gathering on either roof Zemeckis puts stereoscopic 3D to maximum advantage Gazing from above the wire rests just below screen level we hover above and Ground Zero sits a full quarter-mile in the distance. A shame then that the Imax version Sony screened at the New York Film Festival (the same one they will be releasing on Sept. 30) takes so little advantage of the high-res format. The digitally projected picture appears fuzzy and out-of-focus on such a big screen making it tough to judge (or fully appreciate) whatever care went into re-creating period details too far off to make out. When crowds gaze up at Philippes performance their faces are little more than blurred orbs. We yearn to see their expressions to share in their wonder. ""The Walk"" is an event to be witnessed and too much of the detail seems lost on such an enormous format. Still in addition to being a staggering spectacle it is also an eminently relatable human story and that should read loud and clear on any screen.

Michel says April 6 2016 at 843 am Any scepticism one may have (because of the narrative documentary format) that this movie wont be entertaining best be set aside just sit and enjoy it The high wire scenes along/between the Towers edges looking down even though are most likely C.G.d even for a now ""grounded"" skydiver (even though some of the 1100 ft. scenes appear as though theyre much higher) are sweaty palm toe curlers. Great Movie Reply Hairy Marron says October 2 2015 at 1216 am My God... all of your criticisms are just so weak and uninspired. Shameful actually. Joseph Gordon Levetts accent in the film is one-hundred percent exactly precisely a perfect replica of how Philip Petit actually speaks. It was not intended to stand for all native French speakers of English -- just the one man So if you have a problem with Levetts accent take it up with Mr. Petit himself. If you can pull yourself together enough to get beyond that I think youll find this to be a wildly entertaining spectacle -- the likes of which have never been seen before. Reply Sherri says September 28 2015 at 815 am The film is at least thirty minutes too long. I was hoping this was going to be better than it was. Pretty disappointed on the whole but performances were good (save JGLs accent - agree with others on that). The other thing that bugged me was the fuzziness on the screen. I like ""Man on Wire"" more than this version. Reply cadavra says September 27 2015 at 129 pm The final paragraph reminds us again what an enormous loss we all have suffered now that IMAX has abandoned its magnificent 15/70 film format in favor of digital projection especially on bona fide IMAX screens like the Lincoln Square and the Universal City. Reply Ken says September 27 2015 at 321 pm Very true cadavra. Back in 1971 I was fortunate to be in the first public audience for an IMAX flick anywhere...the live action short ""North of Superior"" designed for the Cinesphere at Ontario Place in Toronto. It was in a word breath-taking. The IMAX process has been co-opted by movie studios now -- its definitely not the same kind of immersive experience. Shame. Reply Ron says September 26 2015 at 939 pm Saw it and completely agree with this. Very disappointing... Reply Wilt Barnhill says September 26 2015 at 915 pm Just saw this and am terribly disappointed. Levitts French accent was horrendous. The whole narrative tone in this movie is excruciatingly dull. On top of all this it dishonours the victims of 9/11 by having their grave treated as a circus spectacle. Yes theres some impressive animation but on the whole the movie is pretty pathetic Reply Will C says September 28 2015 at 1043 am From the footage Ive seen Gordon-Levitt sounds a lot like the real Philippe Petit. And theres more to the Towers than 9/11. Letting the 9/11 tragedy define the World Trade Center and the lives of those who died there that day is dishonoring the victims. Good on Zemeckis for telling a story that celebrates the human spirit and serves as a reminder to remain unbowed. Reply Zen says September 27 2015 at 1227 am You realize the events of this film actually took place 27 years BEFORE 9/11 right? Reply Wilt Barnhill says September 27 2015 at 1140 pm You realize that people have been speaking with credible French accents hundreds of years BEFORE this film right? Frederick Louis Richardson says September 26 2015 at 126 pm Review entirely too long. Variety needs to make room for a real editor. Movie seems too long also. A brisk 80 minutes would help the box office. Reply blip says September 27 2015 at 453 am Fred ADHD meds needed. Attn span too short. (More to the point Ive seen ""The Walk."" And Gordon-Levitts Pepe Le Pew accent in the trailers was enough to make this a ""no."")

Philippe Petits 1974 high-wire walk between the Twin Towers was several things illegal death-defying comically absurd and as evoked in the majestic 2008 documentary Man on Wire suffused with a kind of coolheaded cosmopolitan poetry. Recreating the crime for The Walk director Robert Zemeckis does a crackerjack job with the thrills and a so-so one with the laughs (at least the intentional ones) and skips the deeper magic altogether. Peppered with rascally audience-addressing comments by star Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the irrepressible Petit the films zaniness takes some getting used to--the movie feels targeted at children who gaped at Mordicai Gersteins 2003 picture book The Man Who Walked Between the Towers. Gordon-Levitts oui-oui French accent will require patience (the actors exuberance couldve been more finely shaded) and just when youre okay with it along comes a thick slice of Ben Kingsley as a circus impresario of indeterminate origin. When the plot finally shifts to New York City and its getting-the-team-together buildup Zemeckis goes for wacky pot humor when a sneakier vibe would have sufficed. But theres no denying The Walks total command when were finally 110 stories high. Heres when the Zemeckis of Back to the Future shows up marshaling a winning looseness with the actors vivid 3-D cinematography a palpable sense of weather and danger (prepare to cringe multiple times) and an emotionally rousing moment when Petit salutes the city below. The real events have been sanitized somewhat--Petit immediately jumped into bed with a random groupie after his ""coup"" not a celebratory dinner with dully patient girlfriend Annie (Charlotte Le Bon)--but ultimately theres enough daredevil verve here to offset the pedestrian comedy undergirding it.
