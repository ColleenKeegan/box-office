"Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow By Ralph Gardner Jr.  05/26/03 1200am I was sorry when I learned that Michaels the well-known childrens hair-cutting salon at Madison Avenue and 90th Street went out of business recently. But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

"The Village is pious hokum. Slate Sign In Sign Up The Village is pious hokum. The Village is pious hokum. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.July 30 2004 602 PM Village of the Darned More pious hokum from M. Night Shyamalan. By David Edelstein Opies little girl--shes blind Touchstone has quite properly instructed critics not to spill the beans about the new M. Night Shyamalan picture The Village which means that apart from describing the setting and delivering a few straightforward judgments (the photography is excellent the music is striking the movie is a stinker) I cant really grapple with the writer-directors deepest themes. The expected Shyamalan twist here is actually a cinch to intuit; but most viewers will as I did reject that intuition as both too obvious and too far-fetched. And so the Shyamster stuns us yet again The Village has been written in a semi-Puritan patois that is one part The Crucible and one part a pretentious tin-eared foreign-exchange ninth-graders attempt at replicating The Crucible. It half-works when the movie is in H.P. Lovecraft territory severe wintry New England palette; a suggestion of inbreeding; hushed mentions of ""The Old Ones"" ""Those We Dont Speak Of"" and my personal favorite ""The Old Shed That Is Not To Be Used."" Shyamalan brings all his high-toned arthouse horror-movie tricks to bear on the films slender narrative. Just as in Signs (2002) he serves up a masterly opening a stabbing James Newton Howard overture that segues into Hilary Hahns plaintive violin with Brendan Gleeson wailing over the coffin of his dead child and the village--led by William Hurt--looking on in mute anguish. At a communal meal an unearthly howl like a banshees shatters the silence--a sound that brings an answering howl of antisocial joy from Adrien Brody (shot from a low angle to bring out his snaggle teeth) as some sort of scraggly backward imp. Advertisement This village we learn is a piously isolated place separated from the unruly ""towns"" by a forbidden wood that is populated with the aforementioned ""Those We Dont Speak Of"" (TWDSO). It is an uneasy equilibrium From time to time TWDSO stride into the village driving everyone into underground cellars. In the fleeting glimpses we get (similar to those of the ghosts of The Sixth Sense and the space invaders of Signs accompanied by percussive BONGs) TWDSO are tall and humanoid with bony talons. They also wear cowls of red--a forbidden color in the village even when it springs naturally from the earth. As The Village begins two problems weigh on the villagers why TWDSO are making more frequent nocturnal visits and leaving skinned animals around in putrid heaps; and what to do about the young-uns dying off for lack of medicine available in the towns. Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix) the oft-tongue-tied but stalwart male lead volunteers to trek through the wood in spite of the danger posed by TWDSO ""They will know I am pure of intention and will not harm me"" he maintains. Is his faith well-placed or is he dangerously naive? Are these enigmatic animal-flaying forest dwellers truly keeping tabs on the villagers every toe-touch beyond the tree line or are TWDSO as fictional as WMD? The performers have had a look at the Shyamsters box-office receipts and so play this absurd material exceedingly straight. Phoenix falls victim to a certain creeping cretinism but he has a scene with his beloved Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard) while sitting on a step before the mystically illuminated fog-shrouded wood that is all the more romantic for the stiltedness of the couples village-speak. (""I find dancing very agreeable."") There has been much hype about Howard the daughter of director Ron. She is indeed a honey and from what I can tell an excellent actress with a strong pair of lungs and a sufficient amount of movie-star magnetism to stifle the derisive yucks that her role (pure-of-heart blind girl with the ability to see peoples ""color"") would otherwise elicit. Shyamalans themes are older than literature and revolve around the perils of separating from a perilous society in the name of a safer (and more simple and holy) way of life. But by turning The Village into a shaggy-dog mystery/horror picture he pretty much ducks the most nagging questions. (The conversations I had leaving the theater were not of a religious/philosophical nature but akin to the ones I had as a 10-year-old about why the Howells and Ginger brought so many clothes for a 3-hour tour.) Worse this isnt even an effective scare movie The audience starts giggling less than halfway into our heroines climactic trek through the wood--a Little Yellow Riding Hood red having been appropriated by the wolves. Why didnt they--? Who could possibly have sent--? How could they have--? Hush. Mustnt spill those beans. Dumbs the word.

Photo Frank Masi SMPSP Eek Methinks I see a monster 1 / 3 Back to Gallery The Village Thriller. Starring Bryce Dallas Howard Joaquin Phoenix Adrien Brody and William Hurt. Directed by M. Night Shyamalan. (PG-13. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) M. Night Shyamalan has nothing to say but hes going to keep right on saying it until people make him stop. As a director he has skill -- almost everything effective in ""The Village"" his new film can be traced to his genuine ability to create tension through deft camera movement and meticulous use of a musical score. But as ""Signs"" hinted and ""The Village"" makes plain Shyamalan should not rely on himself to write screenplays. This is bad amateur work given a superficial veneer of professionalism. The deficiencies are large and small. Many even most of the individual scenes in ""The Village"" are labored emotionally false and desperately earnest and this has a pernicious effect on Shyamalans direction of the actors. He directs with a reverence for the material that Hitchcock would have rolled his eyes at. He directs the material as if hed written it (which he did) and not a single friend dared tell him the truth. Thus talented actors -- including William Hurt Sigourney Weaver Adrien Brody and Joaquin Phoenix -- arent guided toward coherent performances so much as theyre enlisted into a conspiracy of humorlessness. Some of this could be forgiven if the overall story held tension or interest. But ""The Village"" plays like a slow-motion version of the ""Twilight Zone"" -- and on an off night no less -- with a gimmicky premise and achingly predictable turns of plot. We are introduced to a small rural community living off the land. Everything is cozy in a 19th century village sort of way except for the underlying anxiety In the nearby woods there are mysterious man-eating monsters known in the village as ""those we dont speak of."" The community lives in an uneasy truce with these monsters their implicit agreement being that monsters arent allowed in the valley and people arent allowed in the woods. But there are signs that this covenant is fragmenting. Small animals are turning up strangled and skinned. The monsters are even painting red marks on certain houses -- the monsters apparently are drawn to the color red. At this point ""The Village"" seems a lot like ""Signs"" which was all about small-town people dealing with mysterious signs of an imminent alien invasion. Shyamalan repeats his ""Signs"" strategy of suggesting the monsters without quite showing them. But this time what little we see of them -- red hoods and long red sleeves -- becomes almost laughable. In fact there are moments when ""The Village"" seems poised to become as cheesy in its effects as a low-budget horror film. Shyamalans gracefulness keeps his movie just out of that abyss. Shyamalan assures us of the purity of the villagers by having none of them use contractions. Hurt is a village elder and moral leader. ""You have a restless spirit"" his wife tells him at one point. ""I know that thing that is in your head."" The speech throughout is fuzzy and stilted and the actors are so hamstrung by it that theres no point in talking about most of the performances. Heres Weaver as a village matron telling Hurt that she could tell he was choked up seeing his eldest daughter get married ""I saw your hand move to your eyes on more than one occasion."" As a brave restless young man the villages answer to James Dean Joaquin Phoenix doesnt talk much which means hes spared such dialogue. He holds the screen without looking embarrassed or making us embarrassed for him an achievement in this film. Its an achievement that eludes Brody who plays the village idiot one of those ""uh-oh"" roles. (You know You see a character you dont want the movie to dwell on but its played by a major actor so you think ""Uh-oh."") Brody plays the idiot with an unseemly gusto screaming bellowing simpering sniveling sobbing. Is this good? Well its funny thats something. But would Halle Berry have let Brody kiss her at the Oscars if she saw him in this movie? Dont think so. The one actor who doesnt just survive but thrives is Bryce Dallas Howard the daughter of director Ron Howard in the central role of a young blind woman who can see auras. She is stuck with the same miserable script as everyone else but she has something -- not overpowering beauty but radiance and vitality that communicate honestly. To watch a Shyamalan film is to recognize the Hitchcock influence but how can anyone emulate Hitchcock without picking up a shred of his most obvious trait his humor? Macabre humor runs all through Hitchcock and is used in all kinds of ways -- as an end in itself or to undercut or build tension or to distract from excuse or call attention to improbable turns of the story. A sense of humor might have helped ""The Village."" It couldnt have hurt. The truth is nothing could have hurt. -- Advisory Blood and an incidence of graphic violence.

"In a Turkish village the cycle of life is a grind - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsReal EstateLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsGames THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie Review In a Turkish village the cycle of life is a grind Three friends - including Ozkan Ozen (above) - come to grips with harsh realities. (kino international) Email|Print| Text size - + By Janice Page Globe Correspondent / November 30 2007 In ""Times and Winds"" the children of Turkey are learning that the earth spins west to east. At least thats what their teacher keeps telling them. For most of the characters in this story though the world seems to be standing still.Written and directed by Reha Erdem ""Times and Winds"" (a.k.a. ""Bes vakit"") presents a bleak vivid dramatization of life in a rural Turkish village where grownups seem unable to progress past the mistakes of their parents and kids are too beaten down to change the status quo.The film centers on three young friends. The first Omer (Ozkan Ozen) is the son of a respected imam who is far less of a spiritual leader at home. Belittled and pushed to the point where he prays daily for his fathers death Omer eventually takes matters into his own hands but every clumsy attempt at murder brings him more frustration.Another boy Yakup (Ali Bey Kayali) has a mad crush on his pretty teacher. He fantasizes about marrying her until one day he catches his father peeping through the womans window. Suddenly innocence is gone and with it a dream that isnt easily replaced in this remote and rocky part of the world.The third young lead is Yildiz (Elit Iscan) who has even fewer options despite being a terrific student with a loving father. Her stern mother saddles her with endless domestic responsibilities that include caring for a baby brother shes barely big enough to carry. Sex from what she observes in humans and animals seems a fascinating trap.Erdem constructs ""Times and Winds"" in five parts that parallel traditional Islamic prayer times night evening afternoon noon and morning. As the stories unfold were meant to see how progression and regression sometimes intertwine and why faith does not always cultivate hope.The films setting and photography are often stunning but Erdem and his go-to cinematographer Florent Herry (""Mommy Im Scared"" and ""A Run for Money"") stumble when they pile on extended tracking shots that make it feel as if were being hitched over and over to the same wagon being pulled by a different kid. At nearly two hours the film seems overlong. And despite natural sometimes gripping performances from a cast led by nonprofessional child actors the scripts unrelenting cynicism can wear on a viewer.Still ""Times and Winds"" impresses by presenting a frank unflattering sometimes sarcastic chronicle of Turkish life that would otherwise pass unseen by most of the world. From east to west it offers lessons.Janice Page can be reached at jpageglobe.com. For more on movies go to boston.com/ae/ movies/blog. (c) Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company.

Theyre smooth creepy intelligent full of revelatory dialogue and they dont have that ""Bourne Supremacy"" need to roar along at 4000 feet per second. The camerawork is traditional the editing mature the music judicious. Why its like hes over 50 The production design is always brilliant never too showy never sleazy. And there are ideas just behind the screen that animate the action and -- the films surest triumph -- even figure into the big reversals he seems to think are so necessary. But baby its getting thin. ""The Village"" yields a trick ending quite lame quite tame and quite old; Rod Serling thought of it 40 years ago and he did it better. I figured it out plenty early and the 75 percent of you who are smarter than I will get it even earlier. The film is set in 1897 in a forest-bound village that occupies some forlorn acreage in Pennsylvania but little detail other than the immediate physical reality (cracklingly exact) is conveyed. The villagers seem a hardy intelligent lot ruled benevolently by a schoolteacher (William Hurt at his most compassionately rational) as head of a board of elders. One senses the presence of the Puritan work ethic faith and grammar everywhere particularly in the wordy contraction- and slang-free constructions of the dialogue. Why use three words when 17 will do thank you very much. But generally everybody is happy and healthy and the village itself seems to be a complete ecosystem self-sustained self-regulating self-defending. Still that creepy wailing in the trees at night is only the first of many clues that something awful lurks just outside the village. The dead skinned foxes that start showing up on doorsteps is another suggestion that bad boys are afoot. Ill spare you the details but it turns out that the villagers live in a fragile truce with some kind of marauding pillagers presumably of either supernatural or monstrous origin. Each night the homies leave their lights burning; the young men pull sentry duty in watchtowers manning a torchlit boundary; if it is pierced by the night things the boys must ring the alarm bell. Do the villagers fight? No its not that kind of village. This isnt ""The Magnificent Seven."" They dont deal in lead friend. They deal in pacifism. They lock themselves in the basement shivering in fear hoping to be spared the predations. In other words they live in a constant state of appeasement pretty much at the whim of their oppressors who at any moment may decide its the pilgrims who are on the Thanksgiving menu. This distinction between the hunters and the hunted is so patent that Shyamalan color-codes it. The beast is scarlet the color of blood the color of anger the color of battle. In the village it is banned because it is believed to attract the beasts. It is bad very bad. The good color of course is yellow the color of cowardice which is woven into all the village celebrations and even the cloaks of the sentries. The story proper takes off when it becomes clear that one of the boys has warrior inclinations. The brave Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) despite his acculturation to the system sees that the truce cant go on forever. Only in the outside world -- the dangers of the forest make passage seemingly impossible -- can the answers and perhaps the tools for survival be acquired. He yearns to try to make that journey and return a savior confident that his ""goodness"" will protect him from the beasts and equally confident that if he doesnt go soon the beasts will attack one night for a pilgrim-fry. The whole thing is solemn beautiful and dangerously near kitsch. Only splendid acting and first-rate production design and Shyamalans deft touch with night and fog keep the laughter in check even as the ominous portents in capital letters reach epidemic stage. The critters are known as They Whom We Do Not Discuss (and of course they discuss them all the dang time) and red is The Bad Color and at the edge of the village is The Shed We Do Not Use. The gigglers in the back row would be Those Who Are Impolite. But one surprise is that Phoenix isnt the hero of the film. I give little away by reporting that he is taken out of the movie early on by a deus ex machina character the inevitable madman necessary for advancing plots that have reached dead ends. This sets up the films truest drama which is the adventure of plucky blind Ivy Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard whose Opie nose and coloring give away her paternal lineage) who alone is trusted to walk through the Woods to The Town to get medicines for Phoenixs character. This is as close to action as Shyamalan gets the cute freckly girl in the little yellow riding hood wandering through the briars and the mud almost falling into unexpected sinkholes while unseen by her one of Those Whom We Dont Discuss all spiny tusky malevolence in a red cape sets his sights on her one crackly cackly step at a time. Okay its not the landing on Omaha Beach from ""Saving Private Ryan"" but its pretty exciting. Still Shyamalan really has to do some reconsidering. His surprises simply dont work anymore because we expect them. It was his obscurity his lack of reputation that made the ending of ""The Sixth Sense"" so unforgettably jolting. He had no track record. Now we go into the theater all set to parse to look for clues to try to think outside the box and solve a story thats sustained by a riddle. Its no way to see a movie because youre never unself-conscious enough to let the drama work on you; youre concentrated on the game. And at a certain point the whole exercise is rendered anticlimactic The only suspense left is whether you got it right or not. For his next movie he should forget the big twist thing. He has only one surprise left and it would be the best surprise no surprise at all only drama. The Village (107 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for intense psychological pressure many dead animals and some violence.

Confronting unseen forces Bryce Dallas Howard left in ""The Village""; Takeshi Kitano in ""The Blind Swordsman Zatoichi""; and Audrey Hepburn in the 1967 thriller ""Wait Until Dark."" (Miramax Films) _____Desson Thomson_____  More Reviews  Live Online Behind the Screen  Arts amp; Living Movies _____Free E-mail Newsletters_____  News Headlines  News Alert Most of these movies rely on the conceit of blindness as a device. As in Shes blind and cant see the guy with the big stick trying to whack her. Or Hes blind but hes one heck of a sonar-conscious ninja warrior. Cool. They tell us that blindness is horrible and scary or they tell us blindness is something akin to saintliness. Those who cant see? Theyre truly special. Although Hollywood and other filmmaking centers have no standing orders to educate us or make positive statements about anything its still the unwritten code that they bear some responsibility. Many peoples primary experience with blindness comes from the movies. More and more the movies ""teach"" us about the world. Scriptwriters are in some way Western cultures secular mullahs. But blindness as a dramatic tool goes back at least as far as the Bible. The wife and son of Isaac who is blind dupe him into thinking hes blessing his favored son Esau but instead he gives the blessing to Jacob. What screenwriters can do is to make us appreciate at least for a few moments what it is to be blind. Or provide some sort of quickie insight. The 1965 ""A Patch of Blue"" uses blindness in an intriguing way to illustrate the impossibility of racial colorblindness. Gordon (Sidney Poitier) an African American becomes close to Selina (Elizabeth Hartman) a blind white girl who is unaware of his race. Gordon knows the realities of the world. Despite being in love with her he can never allow himself to have a real relationship. In ""Zatoichi"" the title character is astoundingly alert. His opponents come at him with everything but he uses all his other senses to prevail. Were impressed at the ability of a disciplined mind to overcome anything -- surely not the worst take-home wisdom in the universe. The character played by Howard in ""The Village"" is forced to walk through a terrifying woods where shes told unspeakable monsters are waiting to tear her to shreds. She hears a rush of feet coming toward her. Using her stick to flail at any trees or branches in the way she runs headlong into the darkness. Yes the blindness is just a suspense device. But Howards extraordinarily graceful performance pulls us in. Howard takes the beatific baton from Audrey Hepburn who plays probably the best-known blind character in the movies Suzy Hendrix a housewife in New York who in ""Wait Until Dark"" (1967) finds herself beset by three hoodlums who want a doll full of heroin packets Suzy has unwittingly brought home. But the bad guys havent counted on her courage and her will. Its a terrific thriller with one of the best shriek-aloud finales around. And Suzys courage and resourcefulness make us think differently of blindness. Is there a movie that perfectly captures blindness in its complexity? Not really. But my favorite is a lesser known but engrossing Australian psychodrama called ""Proof."" A grim and noirish triangular story its about three characters who alternately abuse and love one another. As Martin a blind man Hugo Weaving steadfastly refuses to let his condition impede his right to be as nasty as anyone else. In the funniest moment hes obliged to drive a car because of a group of bullies chasing him. Naturally he crashes. When a doctor looks at his eyes she declares ""Youve been blind all your life."" ""I know"" replies Martin. ""What were you doing driving a car?"" she asks. ""I forgot"" he says.

Night Shyamalans affecting but uneven new thriller ""The Village"" or is it the sound of fear? Or is it that hollow ringing sound that occurs when you put your hands over your ears trying desperately not to hear something thats becoming increasingly difficult to avoid? Lets state the ground rules here before we go any further No Im not going to reveal any twists in the plot. (To this day I get annoyed when I see articles that spell out the twist in Shyamalans splendid 1999 thriller ""The Sixth Sense""; surely there are a few of you out there who havent seen it yet.) But ""The Village"" which treads a very delicate line between surprise and saw-it-coming surely benefits -- even more than most thrillers -- from being viewed with as little advance information as possible. Read on if you wish; you have been warned. And so lets talk in very general terms about the problem with ""The Village."" Those who know Shyamalans films which are rapidly becoming a spooky mini-genre (also including ""Unbreakable"" and ""Signs"") know that the plots the thing The still-young writer/director likes to toy with our fears surprising us with both the monster under the bed and the specter that walks in broad daylight. And because we know what he likes to do -- and because this is his fourth thriller in a row -- we know what to look for. Were expecting the unexpected looking for it around corners thinking about what the trademark Shyamalan Twist might be and thus busily spoiling the movie for ourselves whether we want to or not. Movie review Showtimes and trailer 1/2 ""The Village"" with Joaquin Phoenix Bryce Dallas Howard Adrien Brody William Hurt Sigourney Weaver Brendan Gleeson. Written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan. 108 minutes. Rated PG-13 for a scene of violence and frightening situations. Several theaters. This is only partly Shyamalans fault -- but then again hes the one who made the formula so clear in the first place. ""The Village"" is a film of great elegance and skill thats often delicious to watch but its surprises dont surprise; in fact they fall a little flat (as does the films one sad little attempt at humor). The story is essentially an exploration of fear set in a late-19th-century New England town whose inhabitants live in terror of the mysterious creatures (called Those We Dont Speak Of) in the surrounding woods. The cast all of whom do fine work (especially William Hurt as the towns leader and shining-eyed newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard as his blind brave daughter) speak in quaintly formal cadences with utter sincerity; this is an irony-free world. And its a gloriously beautiful one thanks to director of photography Roger Deakins (best known for his work on the Coen brothers films) -- each scene seems as perfectly composed as a painting. Shyamalan with Deakins knows how to convey suspense with a cameras movement; one late shot as a long-shut box is finally opened takes forever as the cameras eye ever-so-slowly pushes between the two people standing in front of it. The colors with vivid reds blooming in a sea of autumn brown are as sharp as any dialogue particularly a splash of crimson blood on a snow-white blouse. ""The Village"" is made with such skill youll almost forgive its too-pat conclusion. Maybe its best to watch it with those hands over your ears without questioning whether it makes any sense letting it weave its spell. Then again maybe the talented Shyamalan might want to tinker with the formula next time around.

Night Shyamalan bidding for a place as its focus. ""The Village"" unravels in a muddled last act likely to send many opening-weekend filmgoers home head-scratching and grumbling both ominous in regard to box-office longevity. There is doubtless an engrossing documentary to be made on the pitfalls of youthful directorial success with M. Night Shyamalan bidding for a place as its focus. If ""The Sixth Sense"" was essentially a crackling-good ""Twilight Zone"" episode stretched to feature length and buoyed by a clever twist the directors subsequent efforts have been equally ambitious but less adept in sustaining their central conceits. Such is the case with ""The Village"" a watchable film for awhile that unravels in a muddled last act likely to send many opening-weekend filmgoers home head-scratching and grumbling both ominous in regard to box-office longevity. Shyamalan is clearly a gifted technical filmmaker ably building suspense about things that go bump in the night in a showcase thats beautifully shot and oozes with atmosphere. Through the promising first third the movie enticingly threatens to be ""The Blair Witch Project"" with a studio-sized budget a Grimms scary tale for our times. Still they dont dole out points for effort and by the time the credits roll ""The Village"" qualifies as Shyamalans least satisfying post-""Sixth Sense"" effort -- adding a peculiar wrinkle to a resume that followed the intriguing ""Unbreakable"" with the spooky if ultimately disappointing ""Signs."" Revealing too much risks spoiling what fun there is in a movie that bears scant resemblance to anything else likely to invade multiplexes this summer for both good and ill -- from the audacity of its setting to the low-wattage casting. The action unfolds in a late 19th century American village surrounded by mysterious woods home to dangerous if elusive creatures that town elders refer to as ""Those we dont speak of."" Although ostensibly safe in the village the residents live in a state of fear unable to pass through the woods in order to reach towns where they might find medicine to cure the sick. In addition skinned animals and strange markings on doors suggest the unnamed neighbors -- drawn to the color red which is thus forbidden -- might be violating a longstanding truce with the villagers for reasons that are anybodys guess. Young Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) who is still smarting emotionally from the death of a child he befriended offers to brave entering the woods. His courage is motivated in part by love for the blind Ivy (relative newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard daughter of Ron) and in part by their mutual fondness for the village idiot (Adrien Brody in a post-Oscar choice only slightly less confounding than lip-lock partner Halle Berrys leap into ""Catwoman""). Shyamalan knows how to keep an audience off-balance The ""Jaws""-like strains of James Newton Howards score that open the film give way to understated violin passages later. Moreover the stilted period dialogue heightens some of the sly humor and tenderness particularly in Ivys forward approach to courting Lucius after her sister bluntly professed her love for him which is by far the films best sequence. Eventually though ""The Villages"" secrets must be revealed with unforeseen events prompting a perilous if improbable journey. And while those sucked in initially will be inclined to root for the film to gather itself as it stumbles the payoffs simply dont measure up against Shyamalans earlier works or for that matter the hour that preceded them. Reuniting with the director after ""Signs"" Phoenix manages to create a character of quiet strength and nobility despite his own burdens with the ""thee"" and ""thou""-style dialogue and he and Howard deliver some laudable moments. No one else fares particularly well except William Hurt as her father. The babbling Brody unflatteringly brings to mind Dwight Fryes Renfield from the 1931 version of ""Dracula."" Tapping into fears of the unknown -- whether lurking among the stars or beyond the trees -- is more difficult than Shyamalan makes it appear and in that respect there are elements to admire here from the artful production and creature design to the kinetic woods. Shyamalan builds his images carefully understanding that peeling back layers slowly and sparingly can be more effective than a frontal assault. The problem is that by now the seams on his fastball are showing. And even if viewers cant anticipate every twist and turn many will find themselves impatient to get there only to be let down upon reaching their destination.

At the instruction of filmmaker M. Night Shyamalan the thriller has been shrouded in secrecy since its inception. Little puce riding hood? Bryce Howard gives her best creepy expression in The Village. Buena Vista Pictures We can tell you there are moments reminiscent of The Blair Witch Project and scenes that recall Witness. Though there is substantial drama and plenty to chew on after the closing credits if you expect terror you may walk away musing ""Is that all there is?"" (Related video See a preview of The Village) Shyamalan has painted himself into a corner Audiences approach The Village wanting something more frightening than Signs and a plot with a more powerful twist than his masterful 1999 success The Sixth Sense. Though its not as contrived as 2000s Unbreakable The Village disappoints. The movie is about a closely knit 19th-century agrarian community that fears a menace lurking in the nearby woods. Dubbed ""those we do not speak of"" the creatures are lured by the color red. The denizens of The Village manage to work play and fall in love. Problems are peaceably solved by a cadre of elders headed by Edward (William Hurt). Other elders include August (Brendan Gleeson) and Alice (Sigourney Weaver) mother of the brave Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix) who wants to venture beyond the villages well-tended borders. Hes in love with Ivy Edwards blind daughter played with an intriguing blend of the ethereal and feisty by Bryce Dallas Howard (director Ron Howards daughter). Ivy also has a special friendship with the mentally unstable Noah (Adrien Brody). The Village presents a compelling premise about peoples inability to shield themselves from loss pain or crime. As Gleeson says after the death of his son ""You may run from sorrow as we have. But sorrow will find you. It can smell you."" At village gatherings Edward intones ""We are grateful for the time we have been given"" alluding to a temporality and a shaky sense of safety at the heart of this eerie tale. The score particularly the work of violinist Hilary Hahn is wonderfully evocative and creepy sound effects create a more frightening environment than the visuals do. The dialogue however often sounds stilted (lines like ""Do not jostle about so"" ring false) and the timing of revelations makes the ending anticlimactic. The Village emerges as a victim of its own ambitions. At one point Edward advises Ivy ""Do your very best not to scream."" That doesnt require much restraint on our part. (Opens at midnight tonight in some cities; nationwide Friday. PG-13 for a violent scene and frightening situations.)

Night Shyamalan; Author M. Night Shyamalan; Release Date Wide 07/30/2004; Runtime (in minutes) 107; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Buena Vista Pictures Posted July 28 2004 -- 1200 AM EDT What an irony - and a shame - it would be if ""The Sixth Sense"" turns out to be the movie that first made and then ruined the career of M. Night Shyamalan. A filmmaker of superb technical facility and emotional control Shyamalan floored audiences with the ending of his 1999 thriller the rare film twist that was genuinely unexpected without being in the least dishonest. Its not his fault that the public has approached each of his subsequent movies as narrative pinatas that will spill forth their secrets if only they can be cracked. But audience expectations alone cant be blamed for the fact that Shyamalans movies seem increasingly to be mapped from their endings backward. Watching The Village which follows ""Unbreakable"" and ""Signs"" in what may come to be known as the ""Gotcha"" quartet you may find yourself poking and prodding the narrative for its first half hour mentally combing each scene in search of whats not being expressed. Thats not a great way to approach a film but in fairness the surface of ""The Village"" does not initially offer many rewards. Set in a 19th-century Northeastern rural community its written in a style somewhere between faux Crucible and an elementary-school tour of Amish country. Benign town elders led by Edward Walker (William Hurt) preside over the villages business while the young ones frolic and go a-courtin and a romantic quadrangle begins to emerge Walkers impetuous daughter Kitty (Judy Greer) is in love with stoic awkward Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix) who in turn is smitten with Kittys blind sister Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard) whos adored by mentally handicapped Noah (Adrien Brody in his first role of any heft since winning the Oscar for ""The Pianist""). The tone is so chokingly wholesome and the world Shyamalan creates is so quaintly ""simple"" in a way that urbanites often ascribe to the rural that one longs for the other shoe to drop if one exists. Since this is an M. Night Shyamalan film prayers are answered in the form of an unseen presence - terrifying creatures who are said to live in the surrounding woods in an uneasy truce with the villagers that depends on neither species breaching the others borders. If by now youre thinking that surely something else must be going on here well who could blame you since the writer-director himself has conditioned you to tweeze every line and frame forensically? What really lurks within those woods is (fear not no spoilers here) a very mixed bag. It gives nothing of the plot away to say that theres a fine line between an ""Aha"" and an ""Oh brother"" Whether you feel ""The Village"" crosses that line may hinge on whether you think Shyamalans screenwriting ability is beginning to lag behind his skill as a director. ""The Village"" offers genuine surprises and a few haunting images thanks primarily to his exquisitely precise sense of pace mood and framing (the brilliant cinematographer Roger Deakins proves invaluable here) and his evident fondness for actors. As a director Shyamalan gets fine work from Phoenix whose ability to convey emotion with limited language serves the film effectively from newcomer Howard who brings steely resolve and dynamism to what turns out to be a pivotal role and from stage veterans like Cherry Jones and Jayne Atkinson in small parts. Less successfully used is Hurt whose abiding taste for inserting...random...pauses...into his lines feeds Shyamalans biggest weakness as a director namely a tendency to treat his own dialogue as holy writ. With each moment directed and played to maximize a sense of portent ""The Village"" feels airless (and sometimes eye-rollingly solemn) in ways that cant be pinned entirely on its isolated-and-surrounded plot; it has the hermetic quality of a talented filmmaker bouncing ideas off the inside of his own skull. When those ideas are great the result is ""The Sixth Sense."" When those ideas are ""Hey maybe the alien invader could be allergic to water"" the result is ""Signs."" In the case of ""The Village"" its not fair to talk about the plot yet but it is reasonable to suggest that with the road into these woods threatening to turn into a creative dead end Shyamalan may want to think about making his next movie with a twist beginning - a new writer.
