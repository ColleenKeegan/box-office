Were currently in the third period and during the past month a number of horror movies have made it to local theaters. Three of the releases are notable Pride and Prejudice and Zombies the Screen Gems release that tanked at the box office; Southbound a low-budget anthology (or omnibus) film from the Orchard a burgeoning indie distributor that specializes in youth-oriented fare; and The Witch which premiered at Sundance last year won filmmaker Robert Eggers the best director prize and was quickly snapped up by tastemaking distributor A24. In terms of quality and ambition they range from inept to impressive and only The Witch has anything resembling a new approach to the genre. Burr Steerss Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is the worst of the bunch a bloated mess that deservedly tanked at the box office. Based on the best-selling mashup by Seth Grahame-Smith who grafted zombies onto Jane Austens classic novel the movie strives to be both scary and funny but winds up being neither. Theres never a sense of fear or peril; everyone is too chirpy including the damned. Steers was the fourth director to take on this project after David O. Russell Mike White and Craig Gillespie successively departed due to scheduling budget and casting conflicts. Southbound despite its numerous writers and directors has a clearer creative vision. The movie enjoyed a limited run earlier this month at the Gene Siskel Film Center and has been booked at the Music Box for April 1 and 2 as part of its popular midnight series. Being by definition a compilation of stories--often by different writers and directors--a lot of omnibus movies are uneven. But Southbound strives for unity and mostly succeeds. All five of its stories involve road trips in an unnamed hostile desert in the American southwest. Sin guilt and paranoia permeate each tale but nowhere as effectively as in the movies centerpiece the nightmarish ""Accident"" written and directed by David Bruckner. Mather Zickel an actor often cast in comedies (Hail Caesar) plays it straight as a driver on a lonesome highway late at night who distracted by his cell phone hits a woman who runs in front of him. After considering leaving the scene he drives her to the nearest hospital which inexplicably appears abandoned. In the first and last stories two buddies are pursued by floating creatures that resemble a hybrid of a spider and a jellyfish. As CGI monsters go these are on the cheesy side but their rough-hewn quality is appropriate for a movie in which viscera is dripping everywhere. click to enlarge Southbound The Witch on the other hand is a meticulously crafted chamber piece. In 1630s New England a family is cast out by a Puritan community because the parents brand of excessive piety--and perhaps their humble economic circumstances--offends the status quo. Our sympathies are with the family at first as they build a hardscrabble farmstead on a remote tract of wilderness at the edge of a thick forest. But gradually it becomes clear that the parents obsession with Satan sin and temptation has contaminated their blameless children. Arthur Millers drama The Crucible about mass hysteria during the 17th-century Salem witch trials was also an allegory for the witch hunts of the Red-baiting McCarthy era. The Witch could be interpreted as an a reflection of frightening ongoing national battles over childbirth and womens rights to self-determination. As in Jack Claytons The Innocents (1961) and William Friedkins The Exorcist (1973) defenseless children are targeted by demonic forces. In The Witch paranoid accusations begin when the infant boy disappears (prey to wolves or ritual sacrifice?) and escalate with the resentment of teenage Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy) who learns that due to her budding womanhood shes to be sent back to civilization as a servant to a richer household. As Thomasin rebels other threats arise and the nearby dark wood increases its hold on the family members imaginations. Like the western horror is a genre well suited to examining tears in the social fabric. Because The Witch is sparing in its use of special effects and generates suspense and foreboding through what is suggested rather than what is seen throughout the film the audience is forced to consider where danger really emanates From intolerance isolation or zealotry? From hallucination or supernatural possession? Or is the danger truly hidden deep within a womans vagina? Early Christian patriarchs vigorously attempted to wipe out competing ancient-goddess cults centered on female fertility. Its telling that the logo for the film displays the ""W"" in ""witch"" as ""V V"" two Vs split apart. Like slasher films of the 1970s and 80s The Witch is about penetration and misogyny but it doesnt take the stance that its heroine victim has it coming.

"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; pride-and-prejudice-and-zombies ) Pride and Prejudice and Zombies (United States 2016) February 06 2016 A movie review by James Berardinelli Watching Pride amp; Prejudice and Zombies I was overwhelmed with a desire to re-watch the definitive 1995 Pride and Prejudice mini-series starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. Thats because this new horror/romance mashup provides just enough flavor of Jane Austens classic to tease without satisfying. Perhaps there are zombie movie aficionados who might similarly be motivated to seek out the oeuvre of walking dead maestro George Romero. The bottom line is that Burr Steers adaptation is unlikely to please any audience regardless of what theyre looking for. When Pride amp; Prejudice and Zombies was published it was rightfully considered a novelty book. The concept could be viewed as subversive and original but its not the kind of thing that stands up to cover-to-cover reading. One doubts however that Seth Grahame-Smith wrote the manuscript to be read. Rather its a ""skim through"" - a one-joke idea that quickly loses steam. Whether or not it could be successfully adapted into movie form is questionable but this movie doesnt work. The Burr Steers interpretation suffers from multiple problems its tone deaf features at least one key miscasting and is far too serious for its own good. Consider the title Pride amp; Prejudice and Zombies. Sounds like a satire right?  Like something the Monty Python troupe might produce. Its a reasonable assumption considering that the premise inspires thoughts of lowbrow humor and high camp. Steers however doesnt get the joke or if he does he fails to convey it. His actors play this straight with nary a nudge-nudge-wink-wink to be found. A few of the scenes - those taken (nearly) verbatim from the original novel - work surprisingly well. But ""new"" material fails and the climax which focuses on the Zombie Apocalypse is so badly realized that even the character assassination of Wickham seems minor by comparison. The movie postulates what might have happened if spunky Elizabeth Bennet (Lily James) and taciturn Fitzwilliam Darcy (Sam Riley) had met and fallen in love-hate in an England overrun by zombies. For the first two-thirds of the movie things play out much as they do in Austens novel (with occasional gory interludes). We meet familiar faces Lizzys sister Jane (Bella Heathcoate) who falls for rich Mr. Bingley (Douglas Booth); charming George Wickham (Jack Huston) who woos Lizzy with lies about Darcy; smarmy and socially awkward parson Mr. Collins (Matt Smith); imperious Lady Catherine de Bourgh (Lena Headey); and Lizzys seemingly mismatched parents (Sally Phillips and Charles Dance). The characters go through all the Austen-inspired moves until the zombies become rambunctious and the Battle of London rages. Its around this time that the film which was never all that good to begin with takes a precipitous downturn. Most of the cast is solid. In fact some of the actors are quite good in their roles. Lily James makes a kick-ass Lizzy and is able to convey the complex emotions of Austens heroine. Matt Smith is delightfully awkward as Mr. Collins providing the films comic relief (also his function in the novel). Lena Headey is an offbeat choice for Lady Catherine but she quickly owns the role - at least until her last few scenes. Sadly Sam Riley fails as Darcy and thats a major blow. His version of prideful and brooding comes across as unlikable and his grating growling voice is nails-on-a-blackboard irritating. Its hard to be enraptured by a romance when one of the great leading men in literature is so badly handled. Riley is a good actor (he was one of the bright spots in the self-indulgent On the Road) but hes miscast here. The task of merging Austens love story with zombie massacres may be too great for any filmmaker to accomplish. And the PG-13 rating doesnt help. But Steers doesnt so much massage the romantic and horror elements as smash them together without trying to camouflage the mismatched seams. His approach doesnt work and the viewer is likely to get whiplash navigating the abrupt tonal shifts. Also the battle sequences are ineptly choreographed although all the cutting could be the result of the PG-13. If you want Pride amp; Prejudice there are several better adaptations out there - try either the 1995 one or Joe Wrights shorter 2005 edition. If you want zombies I can provide a shopping cart full of titles. But wedding the two together - thats an unholy marriage recommended only for those with money to burn and time to waste. Its a truth universally acknowledged that a viewer in search of two hours quality entertainment wont find it here.

Photo Credit AP / Jay Maidment advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT During the British Regency the Bennet sisters juggle marriage proposals and zombie attacks.CAST Lily James Sam Riley Matt SmithRATED PG-13 (violence and gore)LENGTH 148BOTTOM LINE An unexpected and off-kilter treat thanks to a BBC-quality cast and (un)deadpan humor. Seth Grahame-Smiths ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" published in 2009 was a title that didnt really need a novel. Essentially a reprint of the Jane Austen classic with sudden passages of slaughter it was a good gag that instantly wore thin the literary equivalent of a Billy Big Mouth Bass. Here comes the inevitable film version written and directed by Burr Steers. It arrives long after the peak of AMCs ""The Walking Dead"" and in the wake of countless zombie movies like the comedy ""Scouts Guide to the Apocalypse"" and the rom-com ""Warm Bodies."" It also arrives in February usually a graveyard for dead-on-arrival releases. advertisement | advertise on newsday All of which makes ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" an unexpected treat. What could have been a one-joke film turns out to be an entertainingly weird mix of BBC-quality costume drama and lowbrow horror flick. Whats most surprising are the excellent actors -- some drawn from the British stage -- who play even the most ridiculous scenes absolutely straight. Against all odds ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" avoids becoming an Austen travesty and almost qualifies as a credible adaptation. All the familiar figures are here beginning with the strong-willed Elizabeth Bennet (Lily James of ""Cinderella"") and her sisters. Like most ladies of this zombie-plagued Regency they are trained in martial arts as well as polite conversation and the film has some kinky fun peeking into their bedchambers while they strap daggers to their thighs. Sam Riley (""Control"") is perfectly cast as brooding zombie hunter Colonel Darcy while Matt Smith (of ""Doctor Who"" fame) steals the show as a comedic possibly closeted version of Parson Collins. Steers uses two simple tricks to juice up Austens novel of manners. One is to transform dialogue into action whenever possible. A verbal spat between Elizabeth and Darcy for instance becomes a physical altercation with swords knives and chokeholds. (Its easily the films funniest and cleverest scene.) Steers also repeatedly directs his heroines to save their beaus necks in battle. That feels a bit calculated but as the logical extreme of Austens feminism it works. 235 MoviesPride and Prejudice and Zombies trailer The movie eventually flags though only in its final third. Thats a feat in and of itself. For an undead version of Austen ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" has far more life than youd expect.

Barry Hertz The Globe and Mail Published Friday Feb. 05 2016 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Feb. 05 2016 1200AM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Burr Steers Written by Burr Steers Starring Lily James Sam Riley Jack Huston Classification 14A Country USA Language English Just like one-third of its subject matter Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is a film that doesnt know how to die. Despite every indication that the forces of fate were against it - three directors were hired before Burr Steers eventually took the helm; original star Natalie Portman was replaced by Lily James; the lit-mashup trend already hit a nadir four long years ago with Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter - the movies producers continually clawed their way out of development hell in search of bloody delicious braaaiiiins (ie. mindless audiences bored stiff by Februarys typically bloodless offerings). Lily James talks lit-mashup movie Pride and Prejudice and Zombies (AP Video) Unlike the undead however theres nothing especially intriguing about Steerss film which adapts Seth Grahame-Smiths one-trick pony of a novel. You know Grahame-Smiths work even if youve never read it the book occupied a place near the cash register at your local Urban Outfitters and other hipster-kitsch purveyors for years next to Quirk Books line of other mashups such as Sense and Sensibility and Sea Monsters or Android Karenina. Far as I know none of those titles is slated for film adaptations and likely never will be after the world glimpses Pamp;Pamp;Z.Like its source material - a loose term if there ever was one - Steerss movie is a failure across multiple fronts. Are we supposed to laugh as the Bennet sisters trade witty Regency-era banter while demonstrating their kung-fu skills? Are we obliged to wistfully sigh and become emotionally invested as Elizabeth (James) and Mr. Darcy (Sam Riley) fight their attraction for one another while also fighting the undead? The film wants to be funny yet also scary and oh yes its also here to honour Jane Austens novel of manners. It wants to have its cake and eat you too.Perhaps with original director David Russell the film could have delivered a bit of irreverent fun. Or maybe second directorial candidate Mike White could have brought his ultra-dry wit to the proceedings. Hell even third runner-up Craig Gilespie showed he could balance both dark humour and sincerity in 2011s Fright Night. Instead though were stuck with Steers who is a long way from his best film (2002s Igby Goes Down) and not nearly far enough from his pair of Zac Efron-starring duds (2009s 17 Again and 2010s Charlie St. Cloud).Steers can compose and capture a shot fine enough but seems otherwise bored to be here. Each of his scenes collide lazily against the next; transitions are rushed and often ugly and the director never seems to know what emotions he should be steering his cast toward. With the exception of an entertainingly caustic Riley the actors are as lifeless as their foes (often poorly created CGI creatures whose viscera is far from visceral).To be fair things arent entirely Steerss fault. The fact that Hollywood fought through so many delays and shrugged off so many missteps clearly indicates that the industry has no common sense when it comes to genre entertainment. Simply sticking zombies into a film will not yield easy creative dividends. And make no mistake thats all this project is about mere copying and pasting. Its a tossed-away joke of a film that mightve made for a good tweet once upon a time. Instead producers decided it should be a brand unto itself.As a filmgoing public we could easily forgive their pride if they had not mortified ours.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint When I heard that the 2009 genre fiction mashup ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" would be reincarnated as a horror-soaked rom-com I passed through the Kubler-Ross stages of grief. Denial (""They couldnt be that stupid"") was followed by anger (""This is heresy"") bargaining (""No way will I watch that"") and depression (""Weve finally hit bottom""). The final stage acceptance arrived after seeing the film and finding it sweeter than cotton candy. I moved ahead quickly to happiness and laughter. As clever as it is iconoclastic this bloody good satire tickled me by overturning much but not all of what we admire in Jane Austens original. It boasts the sort of sumptuous visuals we crave from period fare surprisingly grounded performances exquisite costumes and audacious comedy. Its not always the ironic humor Austen perfected but it gives the 19th century setting a refreshing contemporary flair. Im now hoping for another spinoff maybe ""Mansfield Park amp; Mummies."" The film introduces us to its bonkers alternative universe right from the start. It opens with a neighborly call to a rural mansion by the shockingly handsome Fitzwilliam Darcy (Sam Riley) a gentleman of fine clothes and finer diction. He warns the guests gathered at the lavish estate that there may be a few of them about to succumb to the undead infection that has for years troubled the kingdom. The conversation proceeds with the poetic politeness of Regency Englands chattering class and its a short leap from verbal sparring to surgical swordplay. The opening is cleverly choreographed bone-crunching (without much bloodshed; this is a PG-13 film). Its followed by eccentric opening credits combining pop-up book artwork with spooky puppetry. Its the sort of implausible but irresistible liftoff that Tim Burton might launch on a good day. The film is in good hands. Its written and directed by Burr Steers (who probed the dark comedy of upper-class Manhattan life in ""Igby Goes Down"") and stars Lily James (the lead in Kenneth Branaghs ""Cinderella"" star of TVs ""War and Peace"" and seen in most seasons of ""Downton Abbey""). Here she plays Elizabeth Bennet whose petticoats are not muddied by strolling through the countryside. Theyre soiled by her battles with brain-sucking rabble. PRIDE AND PREJUDICE AND ZOMBIES  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for zombie violence and action and brief suggestive material. In English Mandarin and Japanese. Lizzie like her four lovely sisters has been instructed in the art of self-defense through combat study abroad in China. The higher nobility prefers its children to study in Japan ninja karate training being so much more elegant than lower-class kung fu. Even in matters of survival social standing is all-important and the root of quite a few satirical stabs. Even the generally lower-class zombies operate like a group under the control of an oligarch which gives the story a mysterious enemy that few marching corpse sagas share. Having a despot to defeat gives the story a useful focus. Battling the undead also presents Lizzie with a grander scope for her action and honors English literatures long fascination with corpses crypts murder opium dens and the use of lime pits to dissolve bodies. Not that the film is that ghastly. While the Bennet girls shoulder rifles and wear sheathed knives on their impressive thighs the violence is at most 5 percent of the film. The story is still at center a romance and their combat skills put Lizzy and Darcy in a gleefully funny hand to hand duel. As they develop a fine mutual admiration the greatest laughs go to supporting characters. Lena Headey who plays the devious Queen Cersei Lannister in HBOs ""Game of Thrones"" radiates cobra-like menace as haughty gladiatrix Lady Catherine de Bourgh. And as Mr. Collins the nerdy parson hoping to romantically snatch an unwilling Bennet Matt Smith is adorably daft. He turns cantering clumsily through a ballroom dance into a delightful romp. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

So we get corsets and rotting flesh ""Downton Abbey"" and ""The Walking Dead."" Its a date movie where the compromise between romance fans and horror junkies has already been made.Writer/director Burr Steers (""Igby Goes Down"") takes a perverse pleasure in his explosive heads retelling of the Austen classic. And he has a vibrant cast in his corner including ""Cinderellas"" Lily James as Elizabeth Bennett ""Maleficents"" Sam Riley as Mr. Darcy and ""Doctor Whos"" Matt Smith as scene-stealer Mr. Collins.The zombie invasion is treated as just another aspect of early 1800s English countryside life. As such the five Bennett daughters are trained warriors each schooled in a different fighting style to hold off the flesh eaters though they dont really let it overshadow their hunt for a regal fellow.""Pride and Predjudice and Zombies"" isnt the first attempt to throw a horror twist on an established work but it works better than ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"" or ""Hansel amp; Gretel Witch Hunters."" It has the right flippant tone and modern sensibility but remains reverent of its source material.The works of Austen are endlessly adaptable and ""Pride and Predjudice and Zombies"" shows they can hold up to even the most outlandish of plot devices.

Rated PG-13 (violence gore). It is a truth universally acknowledged that ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" is a pretty silly idea. So why on Earth is this movie based on the satirical book by Seth Grahame-Smith not having more fun? From the leather-clad ""Colonel"" Darcy (Sam Riley) to generic undead carnage the other better mashup component is often overshadowed Jane Austens 19th-century comedy of manners about a man a woman and Englands patriarchal property laws. Here Elizabeth Bennet (Lily James) isnt just a clear-eyed skeptic of romance and matrimony; shes also a deadly Shaolin martial artist thanks to her survivalist father (Charles Dance) ""My daughters were trained for battle sir not the kitchen."" An animated sequence explains how a ""virulent and abominable"" zombie plague came rather karmically from one of the colonies obliterating London but kept at bay from the countryside. Here the landed gentry continue on with their lifestyles weapons close at hand. Director Burr Steers (""17 Again"") nails the aesthetics -- zombies in ornate period dress are both amusing and chilling -- but has his actors playing it completely thuddingly straight. I dont think Riley cracks a smile once. But the curmudgeonly Darcy also needs an endearing awkwardness and wit -- and Riley sorry to say is no Darcy. James (""Cinderella"") seems game for high camp but is denied Stripped of most of Austens withering prose shes a passable action figure in passably filmed action sequences. Occasionally Steers gets it right When Darcy first proposes to Elizabeth mostly via insults the exchange earns him a roundhouse kick to his chest -- as it maybe always should have. Matt Smith (""Doctor Who"") hamming it up as the pretentious parson Mr. Collins is a brief comic gem. Heir to the Bennet fortune hes looking for a bride among the sisters -- who cringe at his attempts at flirting and obsequious boasts about his patron Lady Catherine de Bourgh (Lena Headey) Englands most decorated zombie slayer. The sweet romance between Jane Bennet (Bella Heathcote) and Bingley (Douglas Booth) is a footnote while Mr. Wickham (Jack Huston) goes from being a sniveling con artist to improbably a supervillain. But the films biggest misstep is its unwillingness to embrace its own title There is ""Pride and Prejudice"" or there are zombies; theyre too rarely intertwined. The result is as our heroine might say tolerable at best.

Jay Maidment/Courtesy of Screen Gems It sounds like the worst sort of date-night compromise like some terrible aesthetic treaty between a couple that fights over DVR space for Downton Abbey and The Walking Dead. And yet Seth Grahame-Smiths genre mashup Pride and Prejudice and Zombies was released to mostly kind reviews and robust sales launching a cottage industry of horror-themed twists on literary masterpieces or popular historical figures like Sense and Sensibility (now with sea monsters) and Abraham Lincoln (now a vampire hunter). For many Grahame-Smiths use of Jane Austens prose -- shes credited as co-author -- retained the integrity of the book while playfully grafting a period horror-comedy on top of it. Away from the page however Pride and Prejudice and Zombies reverts to being the unredeemed awful concept of Austens peanut butter getting in George Romeros chocolate. Combining a classic novel of manners with a subgenre rooted in modern political metaphor feasts on the brains of both hosts reducing Pride and Prejudice to a glib assortment of bullet points and losing the editorial relevancy that has always distinguished zombie pictures from other monster movies. The impulse alone to transform the Bennet sisters into sexy kick-ass zombie hunters feels more conspicuously of its time than timeless. Its early yet but this could be the most 2016 movie of 2016. Owing to a complicated set of circumstances that visited a zombie plague on England at the turn of the 19th century -- this alternative history is laid out like a pop-up book in the clever opening titles -- Mr. Darcy (Sam Riley) now roams the countryside with a cache of weapons swiftly dispatching the undead. In the opening scene he informs a roomful of upper-class revelers that zombies may be in their midst but the newly turned are not always easy to identify. (He keeps a vial full of flies to locate rotting flesh.) Meanwhile Mr. Bennet (Charles Dance) has trained his four daughters in the deadly arts while Mrs. Bennet (Sally Phillips) readies them for possible suitors. Of the Bennets most of the drama focuses on the eldest daughter Jane (Bella Heathcote) who is paired off with Mr. Bingley (Douglas Booth with CW-sculpted hair) and the stubborn Elizabeth (Lily James) who dislikes Mr. Darcy on first second and most subsequent impressions but eventually comes around. Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy share a common cause but their union is postponed by the zombie hordes that have overwhelmed the outskirts of a fortified London and are threatening to devastate the city itself. Meanwhile a plan is hatched to placate the living dead to keep their numbers from growing but the motives behind it seem dubious. Pride and Prejudice and Zombies clings to the dim hope that one of literatures great romantic pairings might be amplified by their partnership as warriors but Rileys sour Mr. Darcy immediately short-circuits any chemistry he might have with James much livelier take on Elizabeth. Director Burr Steers comes to the assignment with the indie drama Igby Goes Down and two Zac Efron romances (17 Again and Charlie St. Cloud) under his belt which indicates a desire from the producers to keep the action from overwhelming the love story. But if Steers resume were unknown it would be easier to assume the opposite that he is an experienced choreographer of blockbuster mayhem with no feeling for Austenian wit or matters of the heart. In truth though Pride and Prejudice and Zombies isnt about finding space between two entities but about a perceived need to make boring old Jane Austen palatable to geek culture. While its possible to gussy up the classics for a young commercial audience without losing their integrity -- Baz Luhrmanns Romeo + Juliet immediately leaps to mind -- not enough has been preserved from Austens book to give it any presence much less gain an exciting new resonance. The only true zombie metaphor here is the impulse to turn everything into fodder for teenage boys.

Pride and Prejudice and Zombies mashes up Jane Austen and the undead review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesPride and Prejudice and Zombies mashes up Jane Austen and the undead review Despite a charming spirited performance from Lily James as Elizabeth Bennet Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is little more than a one-joke movie based on Seth Grahame-Smiths 2009 mash-up.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. Feb. 4 2016Pride and Prejudice and ZombiesStarring Lily James Sam Riley Bella Heathcote and Matt Smith. Directed by Burr Steers. 108 minutes. Opening Friday at major theatres. 14AYou have to wonder if pop cultures zombie fixation is ever going to die.Since it shows no inclination to shuffle off how to find new ways to inject life into an undead yarn?Article Continued BelowPride and Prejudice and Zombies gives it a go and occasionally gets beyond its one-joke premise with a livelier version than 2012s book-to-screen mash-up effort Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter. But its not enough to keep an entire movie afloat even with some heavy lifting from Jane Austens 1813 classic story of love marriage prejudice and class.Still theres a certain delight in seeing the five Bennet sisters sitting with their heads bent not over needlework but cleaning zombie-dispatching muskets. Dressing for the ball involves corsets and concealed weapons. Based on Seth Grahame-Smiths 2009 book and written for the screen and directed by Burr Steers (Igby Goes Down 17 Again) PPZ gets its biggest boost from engaging performances by its self-reliant female cast especially Downton Abbeys Lily James as headstrong Elizabeth Bennet. She shines onscreen with all the insight impatience and charming resolve written by Austen coupled with a double dose of bad-assery thanks to her extensive Shaolin training.Sam Riley (Control) broodingly handsome in a leather great coat as snooty zombie hunter Mr. Darcy is also solid. So is scene-stealing work from Dr. Whos Matt Smith as prissy social climber Pastor Collins.The intricacies of the core plot and much of the dialogue will be familiar from Austens story. Bennet sisters Jane (Bella Heathcote) Mary (Millie Brady) Kitty (Suki Waterhouse) and Lydia (Ellie Bamber) are concerned about making good marriages but are also well-equipped to defend home and family from escalating zombie attacks. But being schooled for battle and not the kitchen means they may not be as prone to domestics as some young ladies as patriarch Mr. Bennet (Charles Dance) informs one suitor.Theres a lot less blood splattered than expected as the zombies rampage even as they prove themselves craftier than typical screen versions. Its fun initially to see such unrelated genres mesh although the movie looks better in drawing and dining rooms than outdoors where overdone CGI and some underlit scenes dont help the production.Not gory enough to satisfy horror fans nor clever enough for a really good laugh the zombie battles get wearisome once the novelty of the spirited Bennet siblings engaging in balletic swordplay while delivering lethal high kicks in Empire-waist gowns wears off.

Happily PPZ - as fans of the 2009 mash-up novel know it - mostly delivers. The surprising thing is that the best and funniest parts of the film do not involve the 19th Century invasion of the Undead created by mash-up novelist Seth Grahame-Smith nor the Buffy the Vampire Slayer-ish calls to action of the marriageable Bennet girls with swords in hand and knives in their garters. No its Jane Austen - author of those books you dreaded reading in high school English class - whose words keep the movie from merely wallowing in ridiculousness and camp. Like its original source material Pride and Prejudice and Zombies works best as a comedy of manners. There is no funnier moment in the film than when snottily class-conscious and emotionally maladroit Mr. Darcy (Sam Riley) makes his baldly insulting marriage proposal to the spirited Elizabeth Bennet (Lily James). That their eventual exchange of well-honed insults is punctuated by martial-arts punches and kicks is a sweetening of the scene provided by the premise. PPZ is at its best when it is practically a BBC period film with the occasional zombie attack or outbreak among the unknowingly infected. Unfortunately there is Hollywood money in this film and so it departs from Grahame-Smiths own book with a third act final battle (one must justify the 3D). So many movies are resolved with screens full of special effects noise and explosions that to say one is better or worse is like comparing fast food hamburgers. But that still leaves two-thirds of a movie that non-purist Austen fans can enjoy as a guilty pleasure and may even instill some appreciation in newbies. The gravel-voice Riley (Control Maleficent) brings a darkness to his Darcy by dint of his mission to rescue Britain from a brain-eating plague and to dispatch the infected with extreme prejudice. Im going to blaspheme and say I liked his Darcy better than Colin Firths. James (Cinderella Downton Abbey) is already getting a reputation as a natural-born heroine and would have been equally as fine a Lizzie in a straight version of Pride and Prejudice. Meanwhile these two are surrounded by a terrific young-ish cast the best of the lot being the erstwhile Doctor Who Matt Smith as the ineffectual Pastor Collins. Smith who apparently was given plenty of room to improvise enthusiastically turns him into a scone-eating fop. Jack Huston (Boardwalk Empire) is a suitably charming cad as Wickham and Lena Headey (Game of Thrones) is the closest the movie has to a camp figure as Lady Catherine de Bourgh. Austens resentful matriarch here becomes a one-eyed zombie-killer of renown whose battlefield fierceness makes her drawing room determination of who-should-marry-whom carry that much more weight. Its all played with a straightness that makes Pride and Prejudice and Zombies demented fun - at least until it gives itself over entirely to the horror genre.

Grade C+ Author Seth Grahame-Smith has dined out on the winning combination of stitching together two incongruous things one high-brow one low and letting the concept do the heavy lifting. ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"" gave readers and then movie-going audiences an ax-twirling Honest Abe. His other literary soft-serve swirl hits theaters this weekend in ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies."" The cheeky adaptations offer a chuckle at the title but theres not much else to sink your teeth into. But while ""Abraham Lincoln"" resulted in a rather disastrous action flick ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" far outpaces its predecessor. The result is a post-modern genre mash-up of Jane Austen zombies and martial arts ends up being rather ""exceedingly tolerable"" to quote Mr. Darcy. The best thing the film has going for it is its knowing self-awareness the winking at the unlikely pairing of mannered 18th-century aristocratic English society with the brutal and gory violence of the modern-day zombie movie. The violence adds a kick to Austens sophisticated and layered text - the verbal jabs are now accented with body blows and the coupling offers a strange delight. For every time Keira Knightley bit her tongue and repressed her emotions playing the feisty Elizabeth Bennett in Joe Wrights filmed version of the story here Lily James gets to deliver a cathartic roundhouse kick right to Mr. Darcys (Sam Riley) smug nose. This version will most likely tickle fans of ""Pride and Prejudice"" (or those who know some version of it) more than it will the zombie maniacs. Its not a great zombie movie but it is a fun reimagining of Austens book finding laughs in the recognition of characters and quotes. It follows the story rather closely only this time the Bennett girls have trained in China in Shaolin style martial arts at the behest of their father (Charles Dance). Zombies are woven into the history of this version of England and the warrior sisters arm themselves with weapons on their way to a ball giggling over handsome Mr. Bingley (Douglas Booth) while strapped to the gills. The Bennett sisters engage in the agonies of courtship in the same way as the book - theres just more shooting the heads off the undead. Supporting characters contribute color to this mixed-up culture of landed gentry and zombie slaying particularly Matt Smith as the bumbling Parson Collins as well as the lauded zombie assassin Lady Catherine (Lena Headey) in pantaloons and a purple eye patch. However the feature film length stretches the thin conceit too far. The story itself isnt the pleasure - thats found in the unlikely though apt pairing of Elizabeth Bennett and deadly weapons. As the sisters stomp in slow motion into a party full of zombies its applause worthy because it looks so cool (thanks to directing duties by Burr Steers). But thats about it. Austen upended the notion that women need to be taken care of in marriage arguing instead for independence and relationships of love. ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" extends that theme to zombie slaying but doesnt offer any radical new takes on the topic. Ultimately this wild tongue-in-cheek adaptation isnt actually innovative - its just monsters and blood to spruce up a literary classic.

Powered by WordPress.com VIP Sponsored Content Entertainment Movie Reviews 02/04/2016 0724pm Pride Prejudice Zombies cleverly mixes gore Jane Austen amour Richard Roeper richardroeper | email Question Is there no end to the tsunami of material that has sprung from Jane Austens ""Pride and Prejudice""? Answer Apparently not. All great respect to Ms. Austen and her classic novel but weve seen so many film and television adaptations not to mention modern twists such as ""Bridget Joness Diaries"" and the web series ""The Lizzie Bennet Diaries"" and the Bollywood gem ""Bride amp; Prejudice"" and the time- travel-themed ""Lost in Austen"" miniseries etc. that if we MUST get another variation on the story the weirder the better. ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies""? Bring it on. Heck Id rather see ""Pride and Prejudice and Wolverines"" or ""Pride and Prejudice and Enormous Man-Eating Rabbits."" Anything but a straightforward telling of the tale. As was the case with the bloody campy guilty pleasure ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"" (also based on a novel by Seth Grahame-Smith) the title pretty much says it all. Youve got your Regency Era England and youve got your pride and your prejudice with Mrs. Bennet trying to marry off her daughters and the charming Mr. Bingley courting Jane while Elizabeth is repulsed by the arrogant Mr. Darcy mostly because of the deceits of Mr. Wickham and multiple misunderstandings and blah de blah blah de blah ... The fun part? All of this takes place against the backdrop of a great Zombie Apocalypse with the British army and multitudes of civilians -- including the women -- engaged in one horrific blood-spattered grotesque and fantastically disgusting (albeit PG-13) battle after another. Lily James of ""Downton Abbey"" and the recent ""Cinderella"" adaptation -- and yes I wouldnt mind seeing ""Cinderella and the Vampire Prince Charming"" at this point -- has cornered the market on plucky lately and shes equal parts charming and fierce as Elizabeth. She and her sisters are well-mannered lasses but first and foremost they are expertly trained warriors schooled in the martial arts hand-to-hand combat swordplay knife play gunplay and good ol fashioned kick-a-zombie-in-his-skull play. If the ""Fox Force Five"" referenced in ""Pulp Fiction"" were transported to early 19th century England well here they are. The invaluable Charles Dance adds a dignified presence as the doting father of the five sisters; Sally Phillips is a comedic hoot as their horrible mother who is obsessed with marrying them off to men of means. When the dashing and wealthy Mr. Bingley (Douglas Booth) approaches Jane (Bella Heathcote) at a grand gala and asks her for the next TWO dances Mrs. Bennet congratulations him on selecting the most attractive of her daughters -- and she says this in front of the other four. What a peach Sam Riley is a bit of a stiff as Mr. Darcy but then again Mr. Darcy IS a bit of a stiff eh? Theres an obvious spark between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth but she overhears him insulting her at that gala and she stomps off and thats right around the time the story would feel overly familiar and predictable were it not for the zombies that crash the party. Just when Elizabeth is in peril Mr. Darcy appears out of nowhere and blows the head off one zombie in spectacular fashion -- and thats the first of many episodes in which Mr. Darcy saves Elizabeth or (just as often) Elizabeth saves Darcy. In true ""Walking Dead"" fashion time after time when a favorite character is about to become zombie meat -- BOOM Someone appears out of nowhere with a well-timed shot to the head or ax to the eye or knife to the neck. Director Burr Steers who wrote the screenplay based on Grahame-Smiths book that is of course built on Austens book does a nifty job of rocketing from period-piece romance to gory bloodshed with sprinkles of dark humor here and there. Lena Headey from ""Game of Thrones"" is big fun as Mr. Darcys aunt Lady Catherine de Bourgh reimagined as a one-eyed zombie killer. Matt Smith (""Doctor Who"") is at first hilarious and then a bit too look-at-me in his performance as the pompous twit Mr. Collins. Jack Huston who comes from Hollywood royalty and is a terrific chameleon often unrecognizable from role to role (he was the disfigured sniper Richard Harrow in ""Boardwalk Empire"") is sharp as the duplicitous Mr. Wickham. As for that PG-13 rating The MPAA is nothing if not consistent in its hypocrisy vis-a-vis sex and violence. ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is rated PG-13 ""for zombie violence and action and brief suggestive material."" Heads are blown off and limbs are severed in this movie. A severed head is kicked like a soccer ball. A giant of a man hoists a woman by her neck in an attempt to strangle the life out of her. We see newly minted zombies with half their faces rotting away. There are multiple stabbings shootings killings. Ah but the heaving bosoms remain corseted and the language is tame. If ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" had featured a topless glimpse of one of those five daughters or an expletive-filled rant from Mr. Darcy surely wed be talking about an R-rated movie. But a film with a church scene in which zombies consume the blood and the brains of pigs as a communion ritual? No worries PG-13 [s3r star=3/4] Screen Gems presents a film written and directed by Burr Steers based on the novel by Jane Austen and Seth Grahame-Smith. Running time 107 minutes. Rated PG-13 (for zombie violence and action and brief suggestive material).

VPCAnnabelle (Jess Radomska) chews on her grandfather in ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies.""(Photo Screen Gems)Story HighlightsCritics review 3 starsAusten geeks and zombie lovers will enjoy enough laughs to tip the scales in the films favorThe zombie plot is funny but the film stumbles when it loses sight of just how ridiculous it isGood news Austenphile enthusiasts of the undead ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" isnt so bad That sounds like damning with faint praise but in this case its a compliment considering how late this film showed up to the ball.Seth Grahame-Smiths parody novel of the same name delighted upon release in 2009 with its unexpected mashup of zombie killing and Jane Austens romantic novel of manners. That novelty has faded considerably and each follow-up and copycat produced diminishing returns (""Sense and Sensibility and Sea Monsters"" ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"").Its all so five years ago. Pop culture is a fickle thing and gears of Hollywood grind slow. The joke though is still funny. Not funny enough to carry an entire film but Austen geeks and zombie lovers will enjoy enough laughs to tip the scales in the films favor.If you squint real hard the film is largely faithful to the outline of Austens book. Set in early 19th-century England the five Bennet sisters are in need of marrying. The arrival of rich Mr. Bingley (Douglas Booth) and his darkly dashing friend Mr. Darcy (Sam Riley) shakes up the Bennet household especially once prideful Elizabeth (Lily James) starts crossing verbal swords with haughty Darcy.The Bennett sisters (Bella Heathcote left and Lily James) take out the undead in ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies."" (Photo Screen Gems)Only in this iteration heads explode. Frequently.A fearsome plague has reanimated Englands dead. This breed of zombie is especially dastardly as the undead only fully transform after theyve supped on human brains; the newly turned can pass for human.England has rallied for the battle. In the Bennet household the five daughters pass time in the drawing room not with music and needlework but by polishing their weapons and keeping up to date on their martial arts training. There are no wilting flowers here.James does a fine job of looking the part whipping daggers out of her garters and clutching letters to her heaving bosom with aplomb. But her spirit is slight and she withers in the presence of stronger personalities of which there are many. Lena Headey has a particularly fun turn as Lady Catherine de Bourgh a fearsome eye patch-sporting warrior. And Matt Smith is a riot as Mr. Collins the Bennet sisters insufferably unctuous cousin.AZCENTRALPride and Prejudice and Zombies (2016) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsThe zombification of Austens material is frequently funny and sometimes clever but the film stumbles hard when it loses sight of just how ridiculous it is. There are many somber stretches -- serious conversations tortured gazes military planning -- that drag on too long with an eat-your-vegetables quality when something this silly should be all dessert.Reach the reporter at barbara.vandenburgharizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8371.

Comments Pride and Prejudice and Zombies Video Rated PG-13  108 minutes  2016 Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is (a) the greatest movie title since Snakes on a Plane and (b) the worst movie with a great title since Snakes on a Plane. Seth Grahame-Smith wrote the best-selling source novel--or rather Jane Austen wrote it and he punched up her public-domain text turning Mr. Darcy into a fearless zombie hunter and the Bennet sisters into ninja warriors. This big-screen adaptation incongruously mixing well-upholstered period drama and graphic gore is amusing for about five minutes after which youre in for an awfully long haul.

You cant accuse Pride and Prejudice and Zombies of false advertising since it totally lives up to the one-joke punch of its title. Did I mention that novelist Seth Grahame-Smith wrote both of the bestsellers that these films are based on? More News 50 Most Anticipated Movies of 2016 13 Horror Filmmakers You Need to Know 10 Best Horror Movies of 2015 All Stories >> Related From Romero to Walking Dead A Brief History of Zombies How the undead went from drive-in movies to mainstream dominance and became our No. 1 nightmare Ready to co-opt the text of Austens 1813 novel at will (public domain and all that) Steers steers his gorgeously garbed ladies and gentlemen of 19th-century England onto what looks like the set of The Walking Dead. Dont get your hopes up. PPamp;Z is rated PG-13 so the gore is decidedly decorous. But before repetition dulls the party Pride gets in a few juicy innings. If you enjoyed the lovely Lily James in Downtown Abbey and Cinderella (I sure did) youll be pleased to see her here as Elizabeth the most headstrong and independent of the poor but marriageable Bennet sisters. Elizabeth still has it in for the snobbish Mr. Darcy (Sam Riley) but hes an ace zombie hunter and that comes in handy in any century. The movie begins with a naked Darcy being examined for zombie bites by a geezer who practically slobbers over his ""pristine young body."" Wait what? And the camera all but licks Douglas Booth playing a smoothie who courts Elizabeths sister Jane (Bella Heathcoate). Whats a girl to do? If youre one of the Bennet sisters you clean your rifle grab a samurai sword and make good use of the martial arts you learned in China. Mission to waste these brain-munching  ghouls. Its utter nonsense. But James and Riley give it their all. Ditto Lena Headey as Darcys warrior aunt and Headeys Game of Thrones daddy Charles Dance as the harried patriarch of the Bennet clan. Matt Smith (Doctor Who) overacts everyone in sight as a godawful parson asking for Elizabeths hand. But its human brains the zombies want. Somehow they cant come back to life until theyve dined on grey matter. Funny? Sometimes. Scary? Almost never. PPamp;Z spins merrily and menacingly along for about half an hour. Bad luck that the movies running time is 107 minutes. Topics Zombies Dont Miss a Story Sign up for our newsletter to receive breaking news directly in your inbox.

Close Join the conversation... On Facebook On Twitter With Britton Peele Comment on one of our official threads. Share This Story Share Discuss Meh There are way too many zombie movies. There have probably been too many adaptations of Pride and Prejudice. So by all accounts Pride and Prejudice and Zombies shouldnt work. Yet somehow the shambling corpses of both dead cinematic horses manage to combine into a movie thats fun funny gory and yet still strangely romantic. Based on the parody novel by the same name Pride and Prejudice and Zombies takes Jane Austens classic story and well throws zombies into it. Most of the themes and much of the original dialogue remains untouched resulting in scenes of romantic 1800s musings paired with references to the Book of Revelation and images of and decapitated undead hordes. Lily James and Bella Heathcote in Screen Gems PRIDE AND PREJUDICE AND ZOMBIES. Jay Maidment Above all this works because Pride and Prejudice and Zombies knows exactly what it is and doesnt pretend to be more. The plot never takes itself too seriously even in the most dramatic of moments. It knows its an absurd comedy not a Walking Dead period piece. Matt Smith (Doctor Who) in particular is a comedic standout as the awkward romantic Parson Collins who is neither a brave warrior nor a particularly good suitor (his skills as a vicar are in question as well). Lily James and Matt Smith on slaying (or running from) the undead in Pride and Prejudice and Zombies Not to say that the action isnt worthwhile. Lily James (Cinderella Downton Abbey) shines in the lead role of Elizabeth Bennet a woman that always runs toward danger even as the men around her run away. This Ms. Bennet is every bit as strong and independent as the original character Austen created with the added bonus of being able to kick the butt of any man woman or zombie that dares get in her way. And of course theres the lingering potential romance between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy (Sam Riley) a general who for the most part is more focused on keeping his country safe from zombies than he is on finding a wife. When he does think of women he doesnt think much of the skills that most consider ""lady-like."" ""Any savage can dance"" he says. ""I imagine even a zombie could do it with some success."" Sam Riley and Douglas Booth in Screen Gems PRIDE AND PREJUDICE AND ZOMBIES. Jay Maidment Pride and Prejudice and Zombies does a surprising job at retaining a lot of the same elements of social structure politics and sexism that were in the original work but dont expect a masterpiece when it comes to any of that stuff. If youre here purely for a timeless story and classic plot stick to the original. Adding zombies to Pride and Prejudice doesnt exactly improve on what already exists. What it does do however it make it a lot more exciting on screen. If youve got a significant other who refuses to sit through a dramatic love story with you Pride and Prejudice and Zombies might be a Valentines Day compromise for you. Goes Well With...

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Stephanie Merry February 4 Follow stephmerry A zombie outbreak has fallen upon 19th century England in this reimagining of Jane Austens classic novel. Elizabeth Bennet (Lily James) and Mr. Darcy (Sam Riley) must join forces to defeat the zombies. (Lionsgate) The latest incarnation of Jane Austens Elizabeth Bennet is a most accomplished young woman. Shes studious spunky quick-witted and multilingual. And you should see the way she slaughters zombies. After all she studied combat in China and can read ""The Art of War"" in the original Mandarin. For all the blood and guts ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" is surprisingly faithful to Austens beloved 1813 novel (minus the combat). But the genre mashup never quite meshes. For the uninitiated heres a brief rundown of the movies slow journey to the big screen. In 2009 novelist Seth Grahame-Smith (of ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"" fame) wrote the bestselling takeoff on ""Pride and Prejudice"" and the movie rights were immediately snapped up. Since then various directors and stars have been attached to the project. Just imagine what Natalie Portman could have done with the lead role under the direction of David O. Russell. Instead director and screenwriter Burr Steers (""Igby Goes Down"" ""17 Again"") has been tasked with taming the wild beast. He at least has a winner in Lily James the ""Downton Abbey"" alum who starred recently in ""Cinderella"" and the BBC miniseries ""War amp; Peace."" She makes a lively lovable Elizabeth playing it straight as a woman who proclaims early on ""I shall never relinquish my sword for a ring."" Lily James (of ""Downton Abbey"" and ""Cinderella"") stars as Elizabeth Bennet who as in Jane Austens 1913 novel is smart strong-willed and witty. But shes also an accomplished zombie slayer. (Jay Maidment/Sony Pictures Entertainment) The Bennet girls are well-versed in fighting which is necessary because England is overrun with zombies. And the civil war between humans and the undead is only getting worse. When we first see Mr. and Mrs. Bennets five daughters they arent sewing or drawing; theyre cleaning their guns and polishing their knives. Preparations for the Netherfield Ball include the requisite corset tightening and cheek pinching but also stashing daggers in holsters next to the girls garters. This is all gently amusing. But everyone knows ""Pride and Prejudice"" isnt about action or laughter; its about romance in a stratified society. Enter the rich prickly Mr. Darcy (Sam Riley). Here he wears a long leather coat and delivers his lines with a husky smokers rasp but hes also a first-class zombie hunter -- so his haughtiness is earned. During his first meeting with Lizzie Darcy offends her with insensitive comments as in the book. But he also enrages her by blowing the head off a perfectly civil zombie that Lizzie has been conversing with. ""I narrowly saved her life"" Darcy remarks with satisfaction. That line aside plenty of dialogue has been taken straight from Austens original. Ingeniously the sisters still have their heart-to-heart talks but now they chat while training for hand-to-hand combat. And Darcy and Lizzie share that charged moment when he proposes and she rebuffs him. This time however they do it while punching kicking and wrestling each other. Sam Riley stars as Mr. Darcy in ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies."" (Jay Maidment./Sony Pictures Entertainment) Yet for all the original elements that remain something is amiss. For one thing Darcy fails to transition from a jerk into a worthy suitor. So much for romance. And the middling CGI makes the zombies look like a crowd headed to a Halloween party. There are some laughs along the way most of which come courtesy of Matt Smith playing Lizzies cousin and suitor Mr. Collins. That characters clueless self-importance supplies the most comical moments in the original story and Smiths solid delivery and goofy facial expressions make his idiocy even more riotous. ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" delivers what its title promises a little romance and some undead villains plus a bit of comedy. But this overly busy riff on Austens winning formula doesnt justify all the tinkering. PG-13. At area theaters. Contains zombie violence and action. 108 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is dead on arrival (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is dead on arrival (PG-13) This mash-up of Jane Austen and the undead is a horror to sit through. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle cogleMiamiHerald.com2/4/2016 Editor rating 1.5 Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is a concept in need of a good execution -- in all senses of the word. Based on the bestselling novel by Seth Grahame-Smith -- the writer who is also responsible for Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter -- PPZ is basically a one-joke comedy that imagines a Regency England struggling through an undead apocalypse. There are still balls to attend matches to make and whist games to play. But you never know when a hunter is going to storm in and start hacking off heads.As jokes go its not a bad one but it is the only one not nearly enough material for a feature film. Unlike the best zombie comedies -- Shaun of the Dead Zombieland Warm Bodies -- PPZ isnt particularly funny or innovative or exciting. Once youve seen one gentleman or fair maiden wave a sword at a zombie youve seen them all.The story follows the basic plot of Jane Austens classic The five Bennet daughters need husbands because their family home passes to their male cousin when their father dies. In this version though they also must possess superior fighting skills (the running joke about how they are disdained for learning Chinese martial arts instead of Japanese falls flat every time). When the sisters attend a dance they go well-armed because you never know when some ghoul is going to stagger out of the woods and try to eat a brain. Particularly adept at fighting is Elizabeth who also meets and spars with the wealthy arrogant Mr. -- or rather Colonel -- Darcy a key player in these zombie wars. But shes also drawn to Mr. Wickham who has some rather troubling ideas about human/zombie relations.Director Burr Steers (Charlie St. Cloud 17 Again) has assembled a surprisingly good cast Lily James (Cinderella) as Elizabeth Bennet; Charles Dance (Game of Thrones) as her father; Sam Riley (Control) as a brooding head-chopping Mr. Darcy. Theres also Matt Smith (Dr. Who) as Lizzies simpering cousin Mr. Collins; Douglas Booth (Romeo and Juliet) as the worlds prettiest Mr. Bingley; and Jack Huston (The Longest Ride Kill Your Darlings) as the caddish Mr. Wickham. Lena Headey (Game of Thrones) also shows up as the imperious Lady Catherine de Bourgh not only famous for her vast Rosings Park estate but also her skill at laying waste to the living dead.PPZ has a couple of tolerable scenes to tempt you the opener in which Darcy interrupts a party to seek an infected guest and his proposal to Elizabeth which erupts into fisticuffs because really who hasnt wanted to throw something at Darcy during that scene? But the movie gets duller as it plods toward its inevitable conclusion and Steers makes some puzzling errors. If youre going to slap an eyepatch on Lena Headey and cast her as a badass zombie killer holy House Lannister at least let her kill a couple of zombies.The skirmishes and eventual full-blown battle is garden-variety PG-13 violence -- clanking swords and grunting -- so the action wont past muster for a generation weaned on The Walking Dead. James and Riley might make an interesting Elizabeth and Darcy in a traditional Pride and Prejudice but this version? Its dead on arrival. Cast Lily James Sam Riley Douglas Booth Lena Headey Charles Dance Matt Booth.Director Burr Steers.Screenwriters Burr Steers.

"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies review Tea and crumpets meet the zombie apocalypse in Jane Austen mashup - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Pride and Prejudice and Zombies review Tea and crumpets meet the zombie apocalypse Trailer Pride and Prejudice and Zombies ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" is horror film also full of romance and comedy. The film stars Lily James Lena Headey Jack Huston Douglas Booth Matt Smith and Charles Dance. The film is a take on the classic Jane Austen story only this time with zombies in the mix. The film opens on Feb. 5 2016. (ScreenPlay) ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" is horror film also full of romance and comedy. The film stars Lily James Lena Headey Jack Huston Douglas Booth Matt Smith and Charles Dance. The film is a take on the classic Jane Austen story only this time with zombies in the mix. The film opens on Feb. 5 2016. (ScreenPlay) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Its apples and oranges but the film version of ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" is in fact slightly more diverting than the 2012 release ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter."" So were getting there. Fifty years from now when its ""Richard Nixon vs. the Kraken vs. Sharknado"" well have this mashup thing down pat.Seth Grahame-Smith wrote both ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" and the Lincoln melee and adapted ""Vampire Hunter"" for the screen. For the Jane Austen-meets-the-undead scenario the writer-director is Burr Steers who has spent most of his previous films in simpler relationship stuff such as ""Igby Goes Down"" ""Charlie St. Cloud"" and ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days."" So here are the questions going in. As a filmmaker how funny do you want ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" to be? What kind of funny? Deadpan funny? Mugging funny? How gory? Exciting? How does one reconcile all these tonalities for a satisfying smart-stupid picture?Steers answers are on screen of course and Id say hes figured out roughly half of what needed sorting to make it work. Hes most comfortable with simplicity. When Austens Bennet sisters sit around the drawing room and discuss romantic prospects and suitors and the like while cleaning their zombie-killing weaponry the joke lands because its matter-of-fact. It helps having Lily James lately of ""Downton Abbey"" and the live-action ""Cinderella"" kicking corsets and taking names stylishly. Shed make an excellent Elizabeth Bennet in a straightforward version of ""Pride and Prejudice."" Not that Im advocating for another one. Weve had plenty. Likewise Sam Rileys Mr. Darcy distinguished by the actors distinctive higher-register sandpaper-y voice would be pretty intriguing in a version of the Austen novel containing no brains being eaten.For those late to the zombie apocalypse An early 18th century plague of the undead has turned London into a lost cause. A century later the battles between human and ex-human rage on all over England. Mr. Bennet (Charles Dance not quite mugging but a long way from deadpan) and Mrs. Bennet (Sally Phillips) have raised their ""warrior-daughters"" to deal with the zombie problem head-on. Check out the latest movie reviews from Michael Phillips and the Chicago Tribune. Cleverly Grahame-Smiths 2009 novel took Austens universe just seriously enough to make the carnage amusing. As the author (Grahame-Smith that is not Austen) told one interviewer Something about the decorum and customs of the Regency era cries out ""for gore and senseless violence."" On a gut level its gratifying to see James Elizabeth and her sisters-in-arms hacking up the countryside and saving their menfolk from their own destruction.But for all the splurch and head-lopping ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" is monotonal. It turns its action sequences into a noisy blur. Those larger questions of tone havent entirely been solved. The ideal film adaptation of this material would be bone-dry in its wit and less concerned with packaging itself as an action picture. On the other hand Steers takes the romance seriously which helps. But not as much as the love match between James and costume designer Julian Day. Early 19th century finery even when flecked with blood never looked finer.

Lily James (right) stars as Elizabeth Bennet with Bella Heathcote as sister Jane. Photo Sony Pictures Zombies give Mr. Darcy something to brood about 1 / 1 Back to Gallery ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies."" This was a million-dollar idea that turned into a multimillion-dollar idea but most of the pleasure was in the concept. Many thousands of people bought Seth Grahame-Smiths Jane Austen-zombie mashup but how many actually read past Page 50? So the challenge of the movie version was to persuade audiences to maintain interest from beginning to end. ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" almost does that. It has stretches where the energy drops out but it never completely loses the thread and the climax brings a reasonable level of excitement. Compared with other Jane Austen movies it isnt much but compared with other zombie apocalypse movies its an intelligent literate effort. Director Burr Steers who also wrote the screen adaptation understood something very important going in The best friend he had was Jane Austen. Sending up Austen making the original world of ""Pride and Prejudice"" into a joke would only buy him 10 minutes of laughs. If he wanted more than a skit he needed a serious rendering of Austens world first as a backdrop to the zombie absurdity (as an ongoing source of humor) and second for its inherent emotional power. Accordingly he doesnt cast ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" as though he were making a Mel Brooks movie but as though he were making a straight version of Austen. Lily James isnt a comic Elizabeth Bennet. Shed be a worthy Elizabeth Bennet in any setting. Charles Dance plays her father not as though he were in a comic zombie movie but as though this were ""Masterpiece Theatre"" and theres nothing funny about Douglas Booth as the handsome Mr. Bingley except that women keep having to rescue him from zombies. The only actor who suggests a hint of humor is Sam Riley as the brooding Mr. Darcy. Darcy has always had a lot on his mind but his problems were nothing compared with those of this new Darcy incarnation who in addition to nurturing a forlorn affection for Elizabeth must also lead the human British forces against the zombie invasion. He looks utterly miserable and now that we know why hes miserable there is something subtly funny in that. As the story begins the zombie situation is well under way. Elizabeth and her four sisters -- members of the semi-impoverished gentry -- are just as concerned as ever with finding suitable husbands. But in the meantime they have been trained in the martial arts and have mastered a variety of weapons in case of zombie attack. Whenever they can they try to get on with normal life but they cant seem to go to a ball without at least one zombie showing up. For those not up on your zombie protocols theyre dangerous adversaries in that theyre ravenous for human brains and everyone bitten by one after a day or two of sweats and fevers becomes a zombie too. This zombie latency period is particularly insidious in that it allows them to hide in plain sight and infiltrate the domains of the healthy. ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" is one joke stretched a little past the breaking point but its carried off with enough conviction that its not entirely dismissible. It has to be counted as a measure of some success that the movie still persuades us to care about Elizabeth and Mr. Darcys romantic prospects in the midst of all the zombie madness. And we actually do worry about them (a little) when they go into battle. In fact at one point while watching the film I had a very embarrassing thought which Ill reveal because its relevant. As the British Army was struggling to contain the zombie menace to London and Elizabeth was trying to rescue her younger sister from the zombie sympathizer Mr. Wickham I wondered ""How did this story ever work without zombies?"" It worked just fine but in the moment that was hard to imagine. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

So goes the opening line of the novelty book Pride And Prejudice And Zombies and as such the opening line of narration of the movie adaptation. Its the perfect funny-stupid one-liner accompaniment to a perfect funny-stupid title--but not as it turns out the perfect hook on which to hang an entire movie. That this particular retelling of the Jane Austen novel feels like a Cliffs Notes version is understandable; that its zombie bits are equally rudimentary though is more disappointing. The movie feels bloodless and not just because the gore is muted and computerized to stay within the boundaries of a PG-13 rating.The actors do their best to take their parts seriously. Lily James fresh from giving a better performance than Kenneth Branaghs Cinderella deserved has another go at essentially pointless material and makes a plucky Elizabeth Bennet one of five daughters whose mother (Sally Phillips) frets about marrying off. The movie reconfigures the Bennet sisters as zombie-slaying students of martial arts which functions both as an expression of their burgeoning independence and unfortunately a commonality that makes the sisters more difficult to distinguish. As in the Austen novel Elizabeth observes the courtship of her older sister Jane (Bella Heathcote with the countenance of a faded photograph even before her character takes ill) by Mr. Bingley (Douglas Booth) and in the process encounters the standoffish Mr. Darcy (Sam Riley). Here Darcy is also rewritten as a zombie-slayer (this is about the level of invention the material displays) and given a halting pre-credits bit of killing that pulls further focus from the Bennet sisters.The movie hits the bullet points of the novel interspersed with zombie battles. This should at very least lend this newest filming of Pride And Prejudice a distinct visual advantage over the dozen or so film and television versions that came before it. Early on the movie plays up its cosplay camp with a montage of the Bennet sisters outfitting themselves in 19th-century garb along with assorted pistols and hidden garter-knives. But this sequence is cheekier and more engaged than what follows. Writer-director Burr Steers sequesters his cast from much of his remaining visual cleverness quasi-historical exposition told as a moving pop-up book; a trickle of blood standing in for the standard red dotted line tracing the characters journey on a map; a few blurry zombies-eye-view shots. He also makes a winking reference to the 1995 miniseries and a possible tracking-shot nod to the 2005 Joe Wright version. What Steers doesnt do is gin up much human interest (or for that matter zombie interest) in the heart of Austens story. Rather than revitalizing familiar material the film makes it feel like a series of foregone conclusions.It didnt have to be this way. While Pride And Prejudice And Zombies sounds like a simple mashup of literary pedigree and horror-movie tropes the mere process of putting this fusion on screen introduces a passel of genres; it is by turns a romantic comedy a horror movie an actioner a costume drama and briefly a war movie. The surprise of the film ultimately comes not from its appealing juxtapositions but from the way it winds up individually botching most of the different elements it juxtaposes. It isnt especially funny with its find/replace approach to integrating the words ""zombie"" and ""brains"" into Austens story (though Doctor Whos Matt Smith gets some laughs as a fussy would-be suitor). It isnt especially scary because apart from some smeary soft-focus and obligatory English fog Steers doesnt offer much in the way of atmosphere. And most crucially its action sequences have little shape; theyre just bursts of exploding heads and offscreen slashes.Its telling that the most exciting bits of action dont pit humans against zombies at all but rather humans against each other. A training sequence in the basement of the Bennet home and a confrontation between Elizabeth and Darcy both have characters sparring athletically while spouting abridged Austen dialogue. Its not especially sophisticated but it is a playful fan-pleasing match of the physical and verbal. The characters movements become extensions of their feelings imbuing their banter and arguments with a palpable sense of performative release. For a few minutes at a time the Austen/genre fusion makes delightful sense. Maybe they should have gone with Pride And Prejudice And Ninjas.

(Jay Maidment/Screen Gems Sony via AP) Review Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is an uneven retelling of Austen classic By Sarah Bryan Miller St. Louis Post-Dispatch Sarah Bryan Miller Feb 4 2016 (...) The Associated Press Lily James in a scene from ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies."" (Jay Maidment/Screen Gems Sony via AP) The Associated Press This image released by Screen Gems shows Jess Radomska in a scene from ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies."" (Jay Maidment/Screen Gems Sony via AP) Editors note Review has been updated to note that ""Clueless"" is based on ""Emma.""It is a truth universally acknowledged that a classic story in possession of enduring popularity must be in want of a remake. Jane Austens 1813 novel ""Pride and Prejudice"" is one of the most popular and now its back -- with zombies.Austens works have provided much fodder for creative recyclers but they rarely stray as far as ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies."" Its not in the same league as 1995s ""Clueless"" a witty retelling of ""Emma"" but its a considerable improvement over the 2009 book by Seth Grahame-Smith that gave birth to it a funny idea ruined by abysmal writing. (I couldnt finish it.) A zombie plague has overtaken Regency England a backstory told in a clever puppet show. The gentry send their children to Japan (the aristocratic choice) or China (the sensible choice) to train in martial arts. The zombies are growing smarter (and in some cases surprisingly articulate) and young ladies like the five Bennet sisters must be as concerned with self-defense against the zombie apocalypse as they are with the traditional womanly arts and the imperative of finding a husband.The greatest strength of the movie is that the cast plays it absolutely straight. Lily James who established herself as an adept in period drama playing Lady Rose in ""Downton Abbey"" takes the role of Elizabeth Bennet; she looks fetching in adapted-for-wushu Empire styles whilst kicking butt.Her foil Fitzwilliam Darcy (Sam Riley) loves her as much for her warlike skills as for her mind. Riley does the glum side of Darcy better than the aristocratic side but he moves well. The other Bennet sisters are largely interchangeable aside from Bella Heathcotes Jane. Jack Huston is a strong Wickham. Lena Headey is effective as an Amazonian Lady Catherine de Bourgh whose estate Rosings is the best-defended house in England. Charles Dance and Sally Phillips are amusing as the senior Bennets. Douglas Booth is a pretty Mr. Bingley; Matt Smiths Mr. Collins is more fumbling than bombastic while still mining the comic potential in the role.Director and screenwriter Burr Steers (Austen and Grahame-Smith are also credited with the screenplay) has turned Darcys original proposal to Elizabeth into a martial arts session the comic high point of the film. Overall the movie is an uneasy mix of humor romance and horror with dead spots throughout. True Janeites will wince as Mr. Collins refers to himself as ""Parson"" an unofficial and vulgar term for a minister but the Bennet sisters cleaning their weaponry while chattering about dances and prospects is great fun. The zombie scenes are startling but only PG-13 horrifying. That will probably be just fine with most Jane Austen fans.What ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies""  21/2 stars out of four  Run time 140  Rating PG-13  Content Zombie violence and action and brief suggestive material Sarah Bryan Miller  314-340-8249Classical music criticsbmillermusic on Twittersbmillerpost-dispatch.com The eternal appeal of Pride and Prejudice Jane Austen wrote the perfect story and heres why.

Movie review Pride and Prejudice and Zombies Article Tweet Jay Maidment Pride and Prejudice and Zombies Pride and Prejudice and Zombies   1/2 (out of five) Director Burr Steers Cast Lily James Douglas Booth Charles Dance Bella Heathcote Sam Riley Rated PG-13 (zombie violence and action brief suggestive material) Running time 108 min. By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 320pm on Wednesday Feb. 03 2016 Wednesday Feb. 03 2016 Wednesday Feb. 03 2016 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Novelist Seth Grahame-Smith stumbled into a goldmine back in 2009 when he slammed together the polite world of Jane Austens manners and manors with the dystopian world of zombie destruction and decimation with Pride and Prejudice and Zombies. Not only was it a clever pop-culture concept but it took off like a grass fire turning Austen fangirls and post-apocalyptic fanboys into one big literary zombie army.Now such mash-ups by Grahame-Smith and others -- Sense and Sensibility and Sea Monsters Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter Jane Slayre Mansfield Park and Mummies Android Karenina -- have become a veritable cottage industry so its no wonder Hollywood came calling. But perhaps its time these authors stopped answering.Far better than the dull film version of Vampire Hunter Pride and Prejudice and Zombies at least gets the Pamp;P part of the equation right. Director Burr Steers ( 17 Again Charlie St. Cloud) and a strong cast nicely re-create the Masterpiece Theatre world of 19th-century British courtship. Yet the film is neither humorous enough to work as send-up cutting enough to work as social commentary nor scary enough to work as horror. Its just not a particularly compelling zombie movie. PPZ revolves around the five Bennet sisters whose father (Charles Dance) has made sure they are trained in the skills every young woman of refinement needs Chinese martial arts and zombie killing. It seems along with all the spices and goods British explorers have brought back with them from their New World explorations an infection that turns the living into the undead.But that doesnt stop their mother (Sally Phillips) from wanting to see them married to respectable non-zombie gentlemen. In step Mr. Darcy (Sam Riley) George Wickham (Jack Huston) and Parson Collins (a funny Matt Smith from Doctor Who) who covet headstrong Elizabeth (a convincing Lily James Downton Abbey) who will put down her sword for no man -- though she and Darcy share a love for slaying zombies. And theres Jane (Bella Heathcote) who has fallen for young aristocratic and very square-jawed Mr. Bingley (Douglas Booth).Theres a thread of an intriguing idea about zombies organizing while Wickham has a plan for how we might share the planet with zombies. And there are some fun moments as when the sisters hike up their dresses to reveal weaponry amid all their undergarments. But the fight scenes are choreographed in such a way that its hard to tell whats going on while the PG-13 rating puts limits on how much can be shown anyway. (By comparison Vampire Hunter carried an R rating.)The result beyond the title and the setup is a surprisingly toothless zombie movie.

Share story By Moira Macdonald and Soren AndersenSeattle Times movie critics Moira The most horrific detail of the Austen/undead mashup ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" is this Imagine being dead and still having to wear a corset. Soren So were talking costumes are we? Well all I can say is Mr. Darcy (Sam Riley) cuts a smashingly dashing figure attired in a black leather greatcoat thats a really great coat. A garment thats long in the tail which swirls and twirls in dramatic fashion as the gentleman wields sword and spear against ravening zombie hordes. Moira No arguments here though I wish Darcyd rethink the floppy bangs (which are a dangerous game that only Hugh Grant should attempt). However let us not twiddle about.

To my way of thinking garter sheaths for knives under Empire-waist dresses spin kicks and hatchet-cleavings of zombie skulls immeasurably liven up refined drawing-room situations.

Courtesy of Sony Pictures Entertainment A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Youre probably right if you think you might get a couple laughs out of a movie titled Pride and Prejudice and Zombies. Youre also right if youve guessed that this gung-ho but cruddy-looking mash-up fails from A to Z Its neither good Austen nor good zombie flick. But in those moments when its bad at both at once it can be as delirious and delicious as the opening line of the lit-prank paperback (by Seth Grahame-Smith) that its based on ""It is a truth universally acknowledged that a zombie in possession of brains must be in want of more brains.""If you like that you might relish seeing battle-hardened warrior-daughter Elizabeth Bennet (Lily James) underscore a point of romantic argument by popping the buttons off Mr. Darcys waistcoat with a weaponized letter-opener. You might cheer when Darcy (Sam Riley) now a colonel in the war against the living dead works a feat of corresponding dexterity upon Elizabeths bodice -- with a fireplace poker. Elizabeth and Darcy spat and spar dance and declaim smashing each other through furniture while reeling with diction-class poise through epigrammatic Austen dialogue. Its not just cheek that gets this over. The scene has heat danger charm and words its actually worth these actors time to speak.Call it parody pastiche remix whatever -- for some thirty minutes of its running time Pride and Prejudice and Zombies transcends its goof of a premise to become something fresh and full-blooded. The joke is in some ways a natural expansion of the way Hollywood has long spiced Austen adaptations with heaving bosoms above the empire waists. (James is tasked with heaving so ripely that Mel Brooks might find it too much.) Rather than take up their needlework now the five Shaolin-trained Bennet daughters pass their days cleaning firearms or besting each other in combat. But always they dish debating the difference between pride and vanity clocking one another as they work through a brisk best-of of talk from Austens novel.That contrast is effective The poised artful conversation adds a brainy vigor to the workaday fight choreography. In this Regency London suitors might be dazzled by a young womans graceful turn at a ball but what first wows Col. Darcy is Elizabeths faculty for zombie slaughter ""Her arm is surprisingly muscular but not so much as to be unfeminine"" he rumbles fetching and gravelly-voiced and sporting one of those black leather coats that the costume designers at the Syfy Network still consider edgy-cool.Clueless suitor Collins (Matt Smith) meanwhile informs Elizabeth that once wed to him pots and pans will take the place of her swords and daggers. She rejects his hand somewhat breezily and unlike in a travesty such as Tim Burtons Alice in Wonderland the revisionist pop-feminism gloss here makes in-story sense Society kids in zombie-age England are all sent abroad for martial-arts training and this Elizabeth has read The Art of War in the original Chinese. Nothing could browbeat her into betrothal to a halfwit. Even her parents played by a delightful Sally Phillips and a welcomely merry Charles Dance dont bother to pressure her much despite all the usual mishegoss about inheritances. EXPAND The zombies may have taken her eye but theyll never take her fashion sense. Courtesy of Sony Pictures Entertainment Too bad the film is in want of more of such inspiration. The zombie action is the kind of PG-13 blur that makes a mockery of the MPAA. Kids can see endless stabbings slashings beheadings impalings and even spirited brain-eating all scored to squishy-graphic sound effects but they cant see blood. Any suggestion that hacking apart a human body might be messy is adults-only as far as those moral fools are concerned. The movies not too harmed by its splatterlessness as the zombie scenes are mostly terrible to begin with neither scary nor funny and never once in design or execution coming close to what AMC achieves on a basic-cable budget.Other than the gowns and the cast theres little here to look at. Its often a drab drag. Even when there is something worth seeing were not always shown it. The movie cuts to close-ups in group conversation with little apparent reasoning and the editing has an aggressive desperate edge to it. Lena Headey turns up late as the fearsome Lady Catherine de Bourgh Mr. Darcys aunt -- and here the best zombie-slayer in Britain. She disturbs her guests with an extended fit of laughter that nobody knows how to take including us because the filmmakers neglect to show us her face.Perhaps its to their credit that they retain as much of Austens suitor drama as they do. Upon that edifice they add the zombie drama which itself proves more complex and wearying than it needs to. Theres a siege of London to deal with and dreary betrayals and supervillain plotting and the moral question of whether zombies properly cared for can resist the urge to eat human flesh. Much of that seems beyond the films budget; all of it gets botched. Once were over the thrill of Elizabeth rocking wicked knives in her garters and once the script leaves Austen behind for the usual good guy/bad guy sword fights Pride and Prejudice and Zombies stops feeling like some cheeky adaptation of Austen spiked with genre violence. Instead it sinks into just another pointlessly violent waste of everyones time a styleless no-joke slog that doesnt make zombies better -- it makes Austen worse.

A literary classic gets a gut renovation. Director Burr Steers. (148). PG-13 Gory violence. Area theaters. The hungry monsters in ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" are looking for nice big brains. Well they wont find any here. With its forced marriage between Jane Austen and George Romero this is a story that has to be smart -- and silly. Bella Heathcote (left) and Lily James star in the mashup ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies."" (Jay Maidment) Instead its just dumb and dull as proper lords and ladies occasionally take a break from games of whist to fight off undead hordes and lop off a few heads. Such a bore really. The undead are the zombies part of ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies."" (Lionsgate) Based on the 2009 best-seller -- a far-fetched mashup of the classic novel and modern gore films -- the movie begins by introducing us to the many unwed Bennet sisters. Their mother would like to see them profitably wed and there are a few prospects on the horizon -- including the dashing Darcy (Sam Riley) the handsome Bingsley the roguish Wickham and the annoying Parson Collins. Lena Headey is a one-eyed warrior. (Jay Maidment) But just as someone begins to pitch woo -- oh bother -- here comes another outbreak of the zombie plague thats recently devastated the empire. Time to get out the sabers again. Good thing the Bennet girls all skipped Swiss finishing schools and studied martial arts in China instead. Sam Riley and Douglas Booth are also in ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies."" (Jay Maidment) Its a bizarre idea but the story never builds on it or even really integrates its two genres; the horror scenes remain second-rate horror scenes the dramatic interludes strictly warmed-over dramatic ones. There is one terrific moment when Darcy and Elizabeth (Lily James) simultaneously duel physically and verbally -- every time she aims a poker at his head he deflects it with a witty rejoinder. Touche. And Lena Headey briefly enlivens things as a one-eyed aristocratic warrior - although rather than give her something to do the movie gets distracted with other half-baked ideas like the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Eventually the whole thing (and some characters) just goes to pieces. Theres noise and movement an all-out war and the usual happy ending but no real blood no real life. And not much fun.

TWITTER 2/5/2016 Jane Austens beloved comedy of manners gets defaced with reanimated corpses in a lifeless adaptation of Seth Grahame-Smiths high-concept best-seller. It is a truth universally acknowledged that most people will do anything to make money. And really whos to blame the editor at Quirk Books who first suggested to author Seth Grahame-Smith (he of Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter infamy) that there was great potential in mashing up Jane Austens enduringly popular 19th-century novel Pride and Prejudice with the living dead genre? Ladies must live bottom lines must be met and the trends of the moment must be exploited. Once the final product -- titled Pride and Prejudice and Zombies and released in April 2009 -- became a runaway best-seller there seemed little point in letting out a Chris Crocker-esque ""Leave Jane Austen alone"" But what will those innumerable readers think of this long-delayed movie adaptation which has gone through so many iterations (at highest profile it was to star Natalie Portman and be directed by David O. Russell) that it now resembles something of a reanimated corpse itself? Lumbering lifeless and -- strange thing to say about a cadaver -- almost entirely charmless. Almost entirely because both Lily James as headstrong heroine Elizabeth Bennet and Sam Riley as her brooding suitor Mr. Darcy make for a delightful onscreen pair. And whenever theyre able to do Austens comedy of manners straight (which is rarely) its easy to get involved in the slow-build romance thats made many a reader swoon. Unfortunately theres the matter of the brain-craving zombies the duo have to deal with in almost every scene. These ravenous stiffs have swarmed across 19th-century Britain and are now very close to bringing about the apocalypse. It should come as no surprise that Elizabeths other potential beau the manipulative Mr. Wickham (Jack Huston) is in large part responsible. Nor should it be a bombshell that the original books sharp social satire makes for an awkward fit with the demands of a tale about gluttonous ghouls from beyond the grave. To be fair theres promise in even a one-joke premise like this. One of the few inspired ideas is turning the sequence in which Elizabeth refuses Darcys first marriage proposal into a literal brawl. Its terrific -- though fleeting -- fun watching both characters roundhouse-kick each other while speaking in bodice-era patois. But screenwriter-director Burr Steers (Igby Goes Down Charlie St. Cloud) shows little affinity for the horror elements keeping the gore strictly PG-13 (decapitations and other such entrail-spilling moments tend to happen tastefully offscreen blunting any truly transgressive impact) and proving extremely ineffectual at filming action scenes. There should be a visceral charge in watching Elizabeth and her sisters slo-mo strut their way through a high-society ball with swords drawn slicing down every zombie in their midst. Yet it plays like a half-hearted riff on Buffy the Vampire Slayers uniquely feminist archness Girls in corsets kicking undead ass ... cool Except not. Best curl up with a good book instead.

(What would the Dowager Countess of Grantham say? Something withering no doubt) With director Burr Steers tracking Jane Austens original original text to a surprising degree the film stars Lily James as a martial arts-schooled Elizabeth Bennet Sam Riley as a zombie-hunting Colonel Darcy and a show-stealing Matt Smith as the hilariously full-of-himself clergyman Mr. Collins. The zombies themselves meanwhile depart from the now well-worn playbook of Night of the Living Dead director George A. Romero; instead of automatically coming back to life as flesh-eating ghouls they only lose their minds after tasting the brains of others. If more inventive than scary Pride and Prejudice and Zombies breathes fresh life into the hugely popular but now desperately predictable undead genre. The result should appeal to Austen aficionados and horror hounds alike--which is not a sentence you get to write too often.

Nora Ephrons Lost in Austen to Be Finished by Portlandias Carrie Brownstein Cinderellas Lily James to Join Ansel Elgort in Edgar Wrights Baby Driver Downton Abbey Christmas Special Casts Berties Mom Brings Back Prior Stars Once you get past the title and concept all thats left is idiocy and irrelevance despite the best efforts of a game cast that includes Sam Riley and Lily James More a concept than an actual novel the 2009 best-seller ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" is merely the Jane Austen classic (which is in the public domain) with some brief zombie inserts by the writer Seth Grahame-Smith best known for turning Abraham Lincoln into a vampire hunter. Its just a silly title and a dumb passing idea and now it is a movie written and directed by Burr Steers. Steers a descendant of Aaron Burr and nephew of  Gore Vidal previously wrote and directed the literate ""Igby Goes Down"" before giving the world two Zac Efron vehicles ""17 Again"" and ""Charlie St. Cloud."" See Video Pride and Prejudice and Zombies First Trailer Pits Lily James vs. Undead Aristocrats ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" is an ominous move to cash-grab status for Steers who tries to entertain himself here by introducing stray camp elements into the movie. Mr. Darcy (Sam Riley ""Control"") is introduced as a zombie hunter and in his first scene he is inspected nude by an elderly man who lustfully says that his ""pristine young body"" has no mark or blemish on it. Steers has cast the surreally beautiful Douglas Booth (""Jupiter Ascending"") as Mr. Bingley one of the novels more eligible bachelors and he has encouraged Matt Smith (""Doctor Who"") to play Mr. Collins a fastidious parson in the Austen novel as a comic fop who seems more likely to kiss Mr. Darcy than Elizabeth Bennet (Lily James ""Cinderella""). But all of Steerss queering things up and his attempts to smarten up the zombie mythology which is doled out to us under the credits cannot disguise the remorseless dumbness of this concept. The essential problem here is that the story and characters of Austens novel feel totally separate from the crass and pandering zombie plot overlay so much so that some of it just doesnt make much sense. Also Read Can George Clooneys Hail Caesar Conquer Kung Fu Panda 3? If for example the Bennet sisters are now ninja warriors who have been trained in China in the art of war and the world is close to collapse as a zombie apocalypse approaches then why are they still acting as if marriage proposals are a matter of life and death? The attractive young cast does all it can particularly the sharp-eyed Riley -- who has an unusually gravelly voice and might be trusted to do a real Mr. Darcy someday -- but they have been given a hopeless task. ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" the book presumably sold so well because it could be displayed and laughed over; there are probably not too many people who have actually tried to read all of it. Making a film out of this idiotic idea just lets you see how threadbare and depressing it is ultimately. Mrs. Bennet (Sally Phillips ""Bridget Joness Diary"") has been made into such a weird low-comic figure here that she actually bites Elizabeths hand when her daughter tries to get her to be quiet at a party and the dowager Lady Catherine de Bourgh (Lena Headey ""Game of Thrones"") is now a feisty zombie bigot who wears an eye-patch. Theyve both been lessened as characters as has everyone else in the story. Also Read Cinderellas Lily James to Cross the English Channel in Young Woman and the Sea In the 1813 Austen novel Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy need nothing but their very sharp wits to do battle with each other in a drawing room but in this 2016 movie they have been reduced to hand-to-hand combat in that same chamber and if thats modernization then wed better just call it a day. It needs to be said that actually reading ""Pride and Prejudice"" or seeing one of the film versions of it remains far more entertaining than seeing the story twisted and perverted for disconnected and aimless little laughs. This movie is so crushing mainly because it was made by obviously smart people who are trying to dumb themselves down and theres nothing more excruciating than that. Lets hope that we dont have to see any more of these mash-ups made into movies for if ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" feels unnecessary just think how useless ""Sense and Sensibility and Sea Monsters"" a similar mash-up published in 2009 might be.

Tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt substantial audiences ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" is in fact a moderately entertaining film not deficient in old-fashioned costume drama when it pleases nor in the power of being clever where it chooses but awkward and unsatisfying. It comes with a very encouraging pedigree based on Seth Grahame-Smiths high-concept bestseller; it has the fortune of well-qualified cast members all in the habit of investing their roles with more than they ought and taking cues from other films of rank; and its producers ought therefore in every respect to have been entitled to think well of their box office prospects and meanly of others. However in Hollywood the power of doing anything with quickness is always much prized by the possessor of the rights to a hot property and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance. But the publics good opinion once lost is lost forever. It is not hard to fix on the minute or the spot or the look or the words which laid the foundation for Americas passing fixation with cheeky genre mash-ups. It was not too long ago. Yet the trend reached its endpoint before this film had begun shooting. As a novel ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" cheerfully exploited public-domain laws by combining the actual text of Jane Austens 1813 novel with additional new details that wove in parallel tales of a zombie plague (even impertinently crediting Miss Austen as co-author) creating a literary sensation and a wealth of imitators upon its publication in 2009. Gimmick or no the novel managed to combine its warring components charmingly Such squeamish readers as cannot bear to connect their Georgian-era drawing-room comedies with brain chomping and exploding heads are not worth a regret. In director-screenwriter Burr Steers filmic adaptation however there seems a gulf impassable between them and the films cast must learn to be content with being cleverer than the material deserves. The tonal progressions of the film are very rapid; it jumps from dancing to zombie slaying and zombie slaying to talk of matrimony in a moment. It opens gaily with a prologue that introduces the leather-frock-coated Fitzwilliam Darcy (Sam Riley) -- a gentleman of handsome features noble mien 10000 pounds a year and a quick trigger finger -- as he investigates and eliminates a zombie infestation at a whist party. As further explained by a delightful storybook credits sequence England has been overrun by hordes of the undead uncharmingly grouped which appear to uncommon advantage in their sieges against the living. For the Shaolin Temple-trained Bennet sisters of which the eldest Jane (Bella Heathcote) and the headstrong Elizabeth (Lily James) are the only ones of consequence the zombies are but a minor obstacle in the path of the more pressing matter of securing suitable marriages. Using generous dialogue directly from Austens novel Jane and Mr. Bingley (Douglas Booth the type of happy actor to whom almost every female eye is turned) undergo a dissonant courtship while Elizabeth and Darcy play out a more tempestuous battle of wits amid the zombie raids. That expression of ""violently in love"" is so hackneyed so doubtful so indefinite that it gives very little idea of Elizabeth and Darcys repartee which at one point encompasses hand-to-hand combat and verbal jousting simultaneously. Their performances are well met and their bouts of acrobatic flirtation provide the films chief pleasures Is not general incivility the essence of both love and kung fu? Regarding the sequences of zombie mayhem Steers camera does not move over these scenes in the masterly manner which one sees so many directors do. He does not have the same force or rapidity and with the violence confined to PG-13 parameters it does not produce the same expression. Jump scares and genuine suspense are different things though the two are often thought of synonymously here. As for the zombies themselves they attack in various ways -- with bare-faced lurching ingenious strategies and distant swarming; but making them interesting eludes the skill of all involved and the film is at last obliged to concoct a secondhand doomsday scenario to increase the stakes. At intervals Steers appears as eager to escape all the swordplay as the characters with the scenes of ballroom courtship curiously more intense than the scenes of carnage. (Adieu to dismemberment and spleens What are flesh-eating ghouls to quadrilles and duets after supper?) In acting James is the superior. Riley is by no means deficient but James performance is clever. She is at the same time haughty reserved and deadly and her manners though alive to the potential for parody are always presented with a straight face. In that respect her co-star has greatly the advantage. Riley seems sure of playing the material for laughs wherever he appears; James is continually straddling the line. Elsewhere in the cast Lena Headey is excessively diverting as the Amazonian superwarrior Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Matt Smith ideally cast as the odious Mr. Collins is all astonishment.

Amelia says June 1 2016 at 815 pm This is a wonderful review thank you for providing it and (from what I can tell) without bias. You have given a good summary of the happenings of this film spoiling little of the plot if any at all. It is well written and I truly enjoyed the use of quotes from the actual book (reworked) in order to get points across. It was very clever without resorting to sarcasm. I am an Austin fan and I thoroughly enjoy her stories. However when I first heard of this film I was taken aback. I admit that I had some hope for the film the thought is interesting after all. For the most part however I was fairly certain that it would fail. As it seems from this review I was correct in my assumptions. I truly appreciate the honesty mentioning its good points and acknowledging the skill of the actors and writers. This is a fair review in my opinion honest and without any unnecessary slander or hatred. I know a few people who were angry and disgusted when they found out that this movie was being made. I would not go that far but I agree that this film was taken up in a fad and as mentioned that fad ended before this movie could even begin production. I am somewhat glad. In my opinion as interesting a tale this seems at first there are some ideas that should not come into fruition. From what I have read I feel as though I do not have to see this movie. Knowing the original story and reading this review reveal all I would really want to know. I may see it simply for the sake of seeing it though thankfully I can go and not be horribly disappointed. I wont expect to love it but perhaps I will be pleasantly surprised. It may be tolerable at the very least. Reply suerum says February 7 2016 at 923 am Mr. Andrew your speechifying is indeed clever but your meaning less than sanguine I will take from your observations those parts which promise one some mild aspiration of fulsome entertainment whilst discarding those troublesome aspects that counter the selfsame. I am indeed indebted to you sir for troubling yourself to exercise your purview with regard to this cinematic debut upon our respective behalves.

Reply Tawanda says February 2 2016 at 114 pm Not Georgian though. This is Regency. Not enough cleavage to be Georgian. Reply Thomas Dillon says February 2 2016 at 113 pm My compliments to Mr Barker on the enchanting felicity of his elegant review Reply Phineas says February 2 2016 at 1257 pm A brilliant review perfectly capturing the tone of Jane Austens work. Bravo. Reply Mjkbk says February 2 2016 at 1234 pm This has got to be one of the most ENTERTAINING reviews Ive read in a long time. Bravo Jane Er Andrew Reply Justin says February 2 2016 at 1216 pm That opening paragraph of the review is so Jane Austen.

The questions facing this handsome decently budgeted movie adaptation are how many of the people who bought the book ever bothered to read it and how many of those are going to make the effort to catch it on the big screen seven years later? Lily James (Cinderella) plays Elizabeth Bennett the brittle daughter of a down-at-heel aristocratic family who falls out of and into love with Mr Darcy (Sam Riley) a smokin rogue with a razor wit. Only in this vision of Jane Austens nineteenth-century England is overrun by shuffling brain-eaters so young ladies study martial arts instead of sewing. By far the most enjoyable scenes here are those in which James and her sisters engage in girly gossip while cleaning rifles polishing samurai swords and beating the crap out of each other. Its the zombies that are the problem watering down the violence for teenage audiences and playing fast and loose with undead mythology (zombies can talk now apparently) the film flatlines the moment anyone draws a blade. The comedy too is played peculiarly straight only Matt Smith seems to be having any fun as a parsimonious parson who takes a shine to Elizabeth. The result is an odd inconsequential but not entirely charmless misfire an action-horror-comedy-romance with none of the first two and precious little of the third.

Watch it in a cinema with well arranged sound system big screen and you are absolutely going to enjoy it. Its not a horror movie  - more of a comedy. The well known pride-and-prejudice story with a zombies twist. Blood everywhere PHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMore6 days agoTara PTastemakerFeatured""It is a truth universally acknowledged that a zombie in possession of brains must be in want of more brains.""So begins the bloody adaptation of the novelty bestseller - and every Austen-fan in the cinema who misguidedly went along in the hope that the zombies would be a mere afterthought breathes a sigh of disappointment and resignation. My hopes werent high when I saw this film but I cant say that all of my fears were realised. It wasnt terrible. It wasnt brilliant. It wasnt even really very enjoyable as I spent most it feeling rather uncomfortable. Yet for all this I dont regret seeing it and would probably even watch it again.In its favour were an underlying plotline that is a tried and tested classic some stellar acting and sumptuous costumes (complete with heaving bosoms - they did go a bit overboard on the cleavage). Going against it was the uneasy feeling that you didnt quite know what you were watching. Its at its strongest when it updates its source material with zombie-related backstory and its weakest when additional plot points are added in willy-nilly. It could have been so much improved by simply focusing on the juxtaposition between the zombie-infested world and that of Regency England - and playing it for laughs rather than an odd combination of comedy scares and romantic palpitations. Sadly the latter two frequently misfire and the laughs just werent frequent enough. The pros Lady Catherine De Bourgh blossomed into a stand-out character under the steady hand of eye-patched Lena Headey - any film with an eye-patch gets at least one star without even trying. The class system is amusingly updated to include the snobbery towards people who undertook their deadly arts training in China rather than the more popular Japan. And Mr Collins remains very much the same as ever but he does implore Elizabeth to hang up her sword before their marriage (Matt Smith is a brilliant comedic addition). Unfortunately despite these elegant little touches the film suffers from a case of superfluous zombies. Not scary enough to satisfy the horror film fans yet too jumpy and grotesque to allow you to relax into the comedy or romance  the director unfortunately hits a bum note with his portrayal of the undead. This tones down in the third act (perhaps partly because youre used to them perhaps because theyre shot in crowds rather than close-up) but for the first hour at least they do end up rather spoiling the fun. They feel disgusting yet not particularly scary - a poor combination.Ironically the love story of Pride amp; Prejudice amp; Zombies is perhaps the weakest element. With a sped-up plot theres simply not enough time to feel invested in the leads feelings and the film resorts to cliche on too many occasions.   In all it was an interesting evening but one that could have been improved on so many levels. If you like the original story and can just about stomach the zombies then I by all means recommend it but perhaps wait for the DVD - where the dead flesh wont be quite so in-your-face. If youre in it for the zombies alone dont bother(In response to the earlier reviewer I spent PS6 on my ticket via an offer. I would not recommend spending more)Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreFeb 2 2016Pao_DeFeaturedwhy...? with tickets to cinemas PS13-PS17 a pop...why on earth would anyone spend money on this...?
