Anachronistic idioms aside I wish Luther had made a bit more use of its father figures fleshly and divine. Theyre the films only avenues of personal insight into the man who sparked the Protestant Reformation. The rest of the action is all heady theological badminton as vigorously thoughtful as it is piously historical. Fiennes delivers polemics against relics and indulgences with the flair of a stand-up comedian ""Eighteen out of 12 apostles are buried in Spain"" his Luther muses to a laughing crowd. But the man himself all but vanishes in a Bosch-like tangle of minor characters and textbookish details. Rising above the throng is the great wreck of Sir Peter Ustinov who as the canny saucy German Prince Frederick distinguishes both himself and the movie.

Starring Joseph Fiennes Peter Ustinov and Bruno Ganz. Directed by Eric Till. Written by Camille Thomasson and Bart Gavigan. (PG-13. 124 minutes. At the Clay Theatre in San Francisco California Theatre in Berkeley and Aquarius Theatre in Palo Alto.) Everyone remembers that Martin Luther nailed his ""95 Theses"" to a Wittenberg church door and set the Reformation in motion. But who knew he was a stand-up comic as well? In one of the odder scenes in ""Luther"" a disjointed new historical drama Joseph Fiennes fires off one rim-shot line after another about the Catholic Church. ""Eighteen out of 12 disciples are buried in Spain"" cracks the droll monk to a roomful of roaring theology students. In a roller-coaster role Fiennes is glibly self-assured one moment poised on the brink of nervous breakdown the next and charismatically commanding the next. Its to the credit of this intently focused actor (""Shakespeare in Love"") that he finds as much of a coherent through-line as he does in Camille Thomasson and Bart Gavigans script. Fiennes is admirable throughout. He captures the bone-deep conviction of Luthers beliefs his anguish at turning against Rome and the power of genuine humility in the face of a duplicitous institution. His scenes with Bruno Ganz excellent as a sympathetic Augustinian friar are deeply affectionately felt. Luthers confrontations with church and state officials have a wooden solemnity but even here Fiennes finds the authentic hair-trigger humanity. His huge eyes and broad mouth register Luthers storms of eloquent outrage and guardedly dawning sense of hope. When it comes to heart-tugging encounters with a child unable to walk or Luthers romance with an ex-nun (Claire Cox) perfunctorily handled at the end of the two-hour film even Fiennes cant find a handhold. ""Luther"" would have been more satisfying with some of its dutiful narrative trimmed away. Director Eric Till whose credits include ""All Things Bright and Beautiful"" and ""Bonhoffer Agent of Grace"" fills out his broad under-realized canvas with several big-name supporting roles. Peter Ustinov twinkles with laconic merriment as Prince Frederick the Wise a Luther sympathizer. A jowly Albert Molina hawks indulgences like snake oil to the peasant masses. For all its scope and detail ""Luther"" fails to convey the sense of history moved by a compelling individual. When Fiennes wanders through scenes of human carnage unleashed by his ideas theres a sense of formality and disconnection. Convincing as this Martin Luther may be he never quite seems to live and breathe in a world hes so radically changing. - This film contains disturbing images of violence. -- Steven Winn TOUCHEZ PAS AU GRISBI Crime thriller. Starring Jean Gabin and Jeanne Moreau. Directed by Jacques Becker. Written by Jacques Becker Maurice Griffe and Albert Simonin. (Not rated. 94 minutes. In French with English subtitles. At the Castro through Oct. 2.) . No one embodied world-weary elegance more gracefully than Jean Gabin the French film star of ""Pepe le Moko"" and ""Grand Illusion."" Before Bogie before Mitchum before Sinatra Gabin exuded a cool fatalism that hinted at intimations of tenderness and sensitivity beneath the crust. In ""Touchez Pas au Grisbi"" a classic policier from 1953 Gabin plays Max le Menteur. An aging aristocratic gangster with a thickening waistline Max lifts 50 million in gold bullion from Orly airport -- intending to ditch the crooks game and retire in style. Forty-nine when he made the film stuck in a career slump Gabin played Max with such sad knowing wisdom that he experienced a major comeback. Theres nothing remarkable in the plot of ""Touchez Pas"" which opens today at the Castro in a sparkling print with new subtitles. Max and Riton his ""poor sap"" of a colleague pull off the ultimate heist. Retirement beckons but when Ritons floozy girlfriend (Jeanne Moreau) rats him out to her young heroin-dealer lover (Lino Ventura) plans for all that gorgeous grisbi (the loot) start to fade. The magic here is all in the telling in the graceful laconic direction of Jacques Becker (""Casque dOr"") and the subtle interplay of Max and his underworld cronies. Its in the dreamy vision of nocturnal Paris and the gentle manner in which Max upbraids Riton for spilling the beans to his two- timing amour. Gabin voted ""actor of the century"" in an end-of-the-millennium French poll is perfection here. Like Spencer Tracy the actor to whom he was was often compared in his time Gabin is so relaxed he barely seems to act at all. Its a joy to see him with Moreau a sassy 25 at the time and still active in films today. Their cinematic union though unforeseen at the time would bridge the entire post-silent history of French film. - This film contains partial nudity mild violence and raw language. -- Edward Guthmann THE EMBALMER Drama. Starring Ernesto Mahieux and Valerio Foglia Manzillo. Directed by Matteo Garrone. Written by Ugo Chiti Matteo Garrone and Massimo Gaudioso. (Not rated. 104 minutes. In Italian with English subtitles. At the Lumiere.) . The themes of ""Death in Venice"" -- sexual obsession longing for youth the power of beauty -- permeate ""The Embalmer"" a dark unsettling drama from Italian filmmaker Matteo Garrone. Peppino played by Ernesto Mahieux is a 50-year-old taxidermist and dwarf whose glad hand and boisterous laughter disguise the desperate loneliness of a misfit. One day at the zoo he befriends Valerio (Valerio Foglia Manzillo) a tall strikingly beautiful man who shares his interest in animals. Valerio a chef quits his job to become Peppinos apprentice and soon hes enjoying an inflated paycheck and assorted gifts. Hes a dim bulb Valerio and takes forever to realizes that Peppinos grand overtures -- the ring the dinners the double dates with Roman hookers -- are the sexual lure of a lonely man. Peppino lives large his income enhanced by the Mafia don who hires him to open corpses stash drugs inside them and sew them back up before theyre shipped out of Italy. It takes Deborah (Elisabetta Rocchetti) a feisty full- lipped woman who takes up with Valerio to expose Peppinos game plan to see the manipulation beneath his lets-be-buddies jocularity. Mahieux who won the Donatello Award for best actor in an Italian film builds a character so relentlessly powerful and creepy that ""The Embalmer"" leaves an aftertaste -- we can practically smell him. Garrone like Mexican director Arturo Ripstein doesnt spare us the macabre and the grotesque but draws us deeper than we expect into a very scary place. The actors are perfectly cast but ""The Embalmer"" takes too long to reach its grim denouement and tries too hard to make its points about the twisted renegade nature of unmet desire. - This film contains violence nudity sex and raw language. -- Edward Guthmann TAKING SIDES Drama. Starring Harvey Keitel and Stellan Skarsgard. Directed by Istvan Szabo. (Not rated. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) . Wilhelm Furtwangler one of the supreme conductors of the 20th century chose to remain in Germany during the Nazi regime and when the war ended he had to undergo a rigorous process of investigation before the Allies would permit him to work again. ""Taking Sides"" dramatizes the interrogation of Furtwangler in an attempt to explore the obligation of artists in a totalitarian society. Because they intend the film to be a balanced account that leaves the audience to decide the extent of Furtwanglers complicity the filmmakers must pretend at an ambiguity surrounding Furtwangler that isnt quite there. Though no hero its a fact that Furtwangler stuck his neck out to save the lives of many Jews and he never joined the Nazi Party. Though bestowed with honors by the Nazi authorities he refused to give the Nazi salute and he steered clear of politics. The movie compounds this conceptual problem by placing in opposition to Furtwangler not a reasonable Spencer Tracy-type interrogator but an ugly American -- an uncultured clod who thinks overbearing rudeness is a form of endearing informality. Ronald Harwood (""The Pianist"") adapting his own stage play gives the interrogator an Army major no serious points to make about art and politics. In fact he misunderstands most of Furtwanglers replies. The major can only taunt and badger. As a result the movies promise -- to provide a balanced argument -- goes unrealized and all were left with is the spectacle of an idiot bullying a genius. Harvey Keitels performance as the smug self-satisfied major is terribly miscalculated unless he intended for us to loathe the spectacle of a small stupid man glorying in his sudden power. Thats possible. Stellan Skarsgard plays Furtwangler with an air of exhaustion that seems a generous attempt to justify the scripts weakness that the conductor doesnt defend himself vigorously enough. Of the two men its the major who acts more like a Nazi. Theres only one moment of revelation and that comes by way of archival footage in which Furtwangler is seen shaking hands with Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels after a concert. The truth is in Furtwanglers face a mask of placidness just barely concealing a hint of fear and an ocean of contempt a desire to remain reserved and a determination not to give offense. The tension is unbearable. - This film contains strong language and footage of Nazi atrocities. -- Mick LaSalle TYCOON A NEW RUSSIAN Drama. In Russian with English subtitles. Directed by Pavel Lounguine. (Not rated. 128 minutes. At the Opera Plaza.) . ""We live in an age of rat charmers"" says the chief accountant of a corrupt corporate criminal as she is interviewed by police after her boss assassination her voice welling with regret. ""Gorbachev was one Yeltsin was another."" And Platon Makovsky apparently was the biggest Pied Piper of them all mixing the arrogant greed of an Enron executive with the calculating cruel violence of Tony Montana in ""Scarface"" in veteran Russian director Pavel Lounguines ""Tycoon A New Russian."" As ambitious and smoothly professional as its main character ""Tycoon"" uses a ""Citizen Kane""-like structure to investigate the life and legacy of an oligarch an early-90s phenomenon of post-communist Russia. But although Lounguine has a lot to say about Russias struggle in its transition to global capitalism his film is strangely uninvolving lacking dramatic sweep. It is based in part on the most notorious oligarch of them all Boris Berezovsky a meek mathematician in the Soviet era who bought into a car dealership and rose through largely illicit means to amass a multibillion- dollar fortune and help engineer Boris Yeltsins 1996 re-election. Although the real Berezovsky is in self-imposed exile in Britain after current Russian President Vladimir Putin spearheaded a drive to prosecute the oligarchs Languines Platon Makovsky (played by a crisply handsome Vladimir Mashkov) is assassinated in the first few minutes of the film and those investigating his death interview those who knew him to determine the killer. There are a lot of enemies to sift through. As one interviewee intones ""Behind every bastard there is another bastard"" and the film depicts several of them through Platons rise from car dealer -- he swindles a big automaker by selling off its cars at a loss and keeping the money -- to a womanizing corporate tycoon surrounded by loyal bodyguards. Mashkov has been making a name for himself in Hollywood -- he had a major supporting role in ""Behind Enemy Lines"" the Owen Wilson-Gene Hackman action flick -- and he has smoldering magnetism. But Lounguine never lets him cut loose; hes too cool a customer -- call him Godfather Lite. No horse heads here -- the closest thing ""Tycoon"" has to a memorable sequence is late in the film when he shoots pool with a Yeltsin-like Siberian politician hes trying to bring into his fold. As he systematically beats him game after game Platon gets a flurry of cell phone calls from his right-hand man standing across the large room whispering to him to lose a game here and there. Platon agrees each time as he clicks the ""off"" button on the cell phone then continues to win every game anyway. Its a comic portrayal of ruthlessness and a rare foray into humor. If only the rest of Lounguines film had put more pedal to the metal. - There are several scenes of violence brief scenes of sex with nudity. -- G.

Even with Joseph Fiennes as a visceral intellectual Martin Luther the latest bigscreen take on the Christian reformer proceeds like a stultifying history pageant rather than a movie with a pulse of its own. The aura of the old Europudding brand of production hangs over ""Luther"" (written directed and starring mostly Brits and produced and crafted by mostly Germans). Niche auds of the faithful in North America and Europe are pics best target but theyre more likely to find the film once it hits vid shelves. Though not quite as popular as Jesus with moviemakers Luther is one of the Christian heroes whose story has been told most frequently on film with versions dating from the silent era (1927) to a Brit tube version starring Timothy West last year and now the most lavish edition directed by Eric Till. ""Luther"" displays a yen for period accuracy that makes it far more viewable than the identically titled but extremely different 1976 version adapted by director Guy Green for the American Film Theatre from John Osbornes play. Conceptually Camille Thomassons and Bart Gavigans script embraces a more sophisticated political and social perspective on Luther than Osbornes dramatization which was at its least convincing when it put the reformer into the playwrights typical psychodrama slot as the young man railing against parental authority. This ""Luther"" is fixed in his 16th century timeframe when German intellectual and creative thought was blossoming and found its religious outlet in Luthers radical questioning of the Roman Catholic Church. The problem with ""Luther"" is finally not too little history but too much of it condemning the movie to resemble an illustrated textbook of personalities dates and places rather than being a vivid portrait of an active thinker. Believing that hes blessed after living through a (chintzy-looking) lightning storm Luther joins the Augustinian order of monks where hes watched over by kindly Father von Staupitz (Bruno Ganz) but remains in terror of Gods judgment. Von Staupitz sends Luther to Rome where he witnesses what he deems ""a circus"" of a church making money by exploiting the faithful. This feeling sharpens during a stint as a caustic and stylish lecturer at the University of Wittenberg where Luther begins criticizing Rome for collecting ""indulgences"" (fees paid by Catholics to absolve themselves or loved ones of sins). Just as Luther gains allies such as the powerful and amusing Prince Frederick the Wise (Peter Ustinov in fine brittle form) and fellow academic Carlstadt (Jochen Horst) he ever so slowly -- as is this movies wont -- gains enemies by the barrel. They start with Brother John Tetzel (Alfred Molina) who basically does a religious carny act pitching indulgences to the unwashed masses and move up the power ladder to Cardinal Cajetan (Mathieu Carriere) and Pope Leo X (Uwe Ochsenknecht). Released from his monkish duties Luther writes ""95 Theses"" attacking indulgences system and soon finds himself in a war with the Papacy itself. The dramatic core of this growing confrontation however gets lost as ""Luther"" drifts into long exchanges between obscure characters who lack the sharp introductions and through-lines needed to make them interesting. Script cries for a dramatist of the ilk of Robert Bolt who can combine the necessary research -- plentifully noticeable here -- with the equally needed poetics to effectively convey ideas. Films and plays about Luthers contest with the Vatican and the violence that sprouted from it consistently fail to capture this periods issues and social movements; new versions windy detailings especially when they directly involve the Pope and the German king Charles V (Torben Liebrecht laughably miscast) are of academic value only. Things spring to life only in spurts such as during Ustinovs scenes in which his Frederick explains his support for this difficult but intriguing young cleric or during some of Fiennes more impassioned scenes as he clashes with his friends and authorities. A late third-act romance between Luther and ex-nun Katharina (Claire Cox) is remarkably inert and pics story doesnt so much conclude as limply fade out. Nonetheless Fiennes is completely suited to the role of a devout man driven by a personal love of God to question stolid bureaucrats. Even when the script is lacking Fiennes still suggests great inner stirrings of conviction that give the movie a strong center. Molina however is on and off screen too quickly to make much of an impression. Very fine actors like Ganz and Carriere do what they can do but audibly struggle with the English; other lesser non-English thesps drown in the scripts wordiness. Production is wrapped with rich but old-fashioned taste from overly careful mise en scene to well-researched costumes to pseudo-serious religious music.
