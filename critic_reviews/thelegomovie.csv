Lego Movie review Good film built on low expectations 1 / 2 Back to Gallery The Lego Movie Animated comedy. Starring the voices of Chris Pratt Elizabeth Banks Liam Neeson and Will Ferrell. Directed by Phil Lord and Chris Miller. (PG. 100 minutes.) Its easy to walk in with low expectations for ""The Lego Movie"" a film so saturated with product placement that every single scene doubles as a toy commercial. Adding to the cynicism is the early February release date a time when quality family cinema is typically as plentiful as tulips on a freeway median. The movie is a wonderful surprise cleverly written and executed brick by brick with a visual panache. Filled with humor and action the Warner Bros. movie pulls off an emotional finish that rivals some of Pixars best work. You can argue - and not sound completely crazy - that this is a better film than a few recent Academy Awards best picture nominees. There were early signs that ""The Lego Movie"" might rise above mediocrity. It was directed and written by Phil Lord and Chris Miller who seem to specialize in stealthily making quality films including the charming ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" and a satisfying film remake of ""21 Jump Street."" Lego has a history of nurturing the brand; the companys video games have mostly been excellent in recent years. Related Stories Stranger by the Lake review naked gay sunbathers The Monuments Men review Harks back to WWII movies of old Gloria review Slice of life of a lusty self-assured woman But the first big-screen animated Lego movie has the feel of a passion project - where smart people were given a lot of resources and allowed to execute the craziest thoughts that came to their head. ""The Lego Movie"" is a PG film but its closest comparison is the work of ""South Park"" creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. The single musical number ""Everything Is Awesome"" is so effective youll wonder why Lord and Miller didnt make more. ""The Lego Movie"" begins in the middle of a generic Lego city where construction man Emmett (voiced by Chris Pratt) lives a lonely but upbeat life as one of the most boring Lego mini-figures. He is mistaken for a savior by love interest and rebel leader Wyldstyle who is in a relationship with Batman. (That love triangle is one of many insider nods for Lego-loving kids and adults. As anyone who has played with the toy can tell you a construction worker is at the bottom of the Lego caste system while only Lego Boba Fett is cooler than Lego Batman.) As the friends work to save the city from the schemes of conformist tyrant Lord Business the movie settles into a nice blend of sly rapid-fire humor and over-the-top action sequences that all seem hatched from a 9-year-olds imagination. With plastic brick people instead of flesh and blood the filmmakers and skilled animators at effects studio Animal Logic get a bit of a pass on the violent and racy content. If a real-life construction worker gets beheaded its unspeakably gory. A man photocopying his naked butt is lowbrow and obscene. When these things happen in the Lego world its kind of cute. Lord and Miller offer a lot for adults - from unexpected pop culture nods to a blink-and-youll-miss-it joke about failed Lego play sets. But that humor is almost never patronizing. So many lazier family filmmakers have dropped a line from ""Taxi Driver"" or a double entendre counting on the fact that the joke will sail over kids heads. Part of the uniqueness of ""The Lego Movie"" is that children and their chaperones can enjoy it on pretty much the same level. I felt a hint of worry about two-thirds of the way through the movie realizing that the movies high marks for style were not matched by its substance. For all its in-the-moment satire and entertainment the lack of a human heart became harder and harder to ignore. Thats the last and best surprise from the makers of ""The Lego Movie."" We shall say no more except that the emotional finish exceeds the pleasures of the unexpected ending in ""Frozen."" This is becoming a welcome trend in kid-friendly films making sure the adults walk home smiling as well. Peter Hartlaub is The San Francisco Chronicles pop culture critic.

Another animated outing for the duo ""The Lego Movie"" takes the concept of big screen world-building to extremes as the film imagines an entire universe populated by plastic pieces that snap together - to amusing and entertaining results. Legos not just for getting lodged in your foot anymore. Emmet (energetically voiced by Chris Pratt) is a wholly regular citizen of the picturesque Bricksburg a construction worker who likes doing things literally by the book even if his true (read wacky) colors threaten to shine through at inopportune moments. The world of Bricksburg is overwhelmingly orderly and everyone appears to relish their place in a society that quite honestly seems to fit just a bit too neatly together. More than anything Emmet wants to find his place in the world around him and he attempts to click with both people and situations with a can-do personality a guide that promises to provide him with essential ""rules to fit in."" Emmet of course does not fit in. It might be that he just tries too hard (and that doesnt necessarily appeal to the more laidback citizens of his world) but thats about to come very much in handy for Emmet - because his world is soon transformed by a dunderheaded accident that leads the wily Wyldstyle (voiced by Elizabeth Banks) to believe that he is ""The Special"" a foretold figure who will save the Lego populace from the evil machinations of Lord Business (voiced by Will Ferrell). While Emmet and everyone else in Bricksburg knows Business as ""President Business"" Wyldstyle and the rest of the MasterBuilders (including Vitruvius voiced by Morgan Freeman just doing his Morgan Freeman thing) know him as an evil overlord who is about to destroy the universe for good (well really for evil). The accidental recipient of ""the piece of resistance"" Emmet goes along with Wyldstyle and her yes wild ideas that he is a prophesied leader who will save the entire universe mainly because shes pretty and its nice to have a friend. As their journey ratchets up the Lego world quickly expands out - Bricksburg it seems is not the only realm around and Wyldstyle and Emmet zip through other areas including The Old West (fashioned after the American West complete with cowboys and actual cows) Middle Zealand (an apparent Lego take on medieval England) and Cloud Cuckoo Land (a candy-colored cloud-based area that is essentially presented as a somewhat terrifying rave that feeds on good vibes) on their quest. And yes all of this is still rendered in oddly evocative Lego. The real world is always lingering outside the frame - after all Lord (er President) Business has a room full of ""relics"" that come straight from a clearly non-plastic world (from spare change to an X-Acto knife) - but the Lego world is so amusing craftily put together and creatively made that any flesh and blood concerns are soon forgotten. As with any Lord and Miller property ""The Lego Movie"" is also just plain funny loaded with joke after joke and pun after pun. Of course the gag of ""The Lego Movie"" is that well theyre all Legos but the films medium offers a level of creative freedom that most big studio executives can only dream of as the animated nature of it allows Lord and Miller to round out their supporting cast with Batman Superman Wonder Woman Gandalf Green Lantern and even some of the most recognizable characters from ""Star Wars."" If nothing else theres a level of recognizability to the film thats hard to match. ""The Lego Movie"" is strangely familiar territory for Lord and Miller who did some similar blending with their beloved but short-lived animated series ""Clone High"" (a one-season comedy that imagined what would happen if some of the worlds most famous dead people were cloned and thrown into high school together with characters including Abe Lincoln and Cleopatra). Lord and Millers sensibilities are continually clever and ""The Lego Movie"" works hard to gradually deliver surprising payoffs to what seem to be throwaway bits. (Yes ""the piece of resistance"" is eventually explained in great detail but even that doesnt detract from how funny its actual real world application is.) Lord and Miller have already proven adept at blending genres but ""The Lego Movie"" is a new step forward for them one that clicks right into place more often than not.

Mom2MomDFW.com Rants raves reviews and resources for Dallas-Fort Worth parents By Maricar Estrella - mestrellamom2momdfw.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story As a parent its easy to be cynical about a film based on a toy. Will you be bombarded with a 90-minute infomercial that by the end of the sell will cost you more than the price of the movie ticket? Fortunately The Lego Movie has enough wit and wisdom to send a recession-age message to families on the importance of thinking through problems with creativity. The film begins with a dastardly villain Lord Business (Will Ferrell) who has stolen the mystical ""Kragle"" from sage Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman). In the battle to protect the artifact Vitruvius loses his sight but doesnt go down lightly. He curses Lord Business with a prophecy of a master builder who will find the ""piece of resistance"" and save the world from the evils of the ""Kragle."" Years later we meet loner Emmet (Chris Pratt) a nondescript Lego construction guy who needs to follow step-by-step instructions just to get through his day ""Always return a compliment. Always root for the local sports team "" The government of Emmets hometown of Bricksburg is run by President Business aka Lord Business channeling a Donald Trump do. Business has the whole town of Bricksburg under his control and distracts them with a catchy pop tune titled Everything Is Awesome high-priced lattes and a reality TV show called Wheres My Pants? Emmet stumbles upon the famed ""piece of resistance"" while literally falling for hip chick WyldStyle (Elizabeth Banks) a ninja-like master builder who had been searching for the piece. She mistakenly thinks Emmet is ""The Special"" -- the one chosen to save the world. Meanwhile Business is planning a total takeover of the townsfolk by unleashing the Kragle a wadded up Krazy Glue to stick everyone in place. He tests this out on his maniacal henchman Good Cop/Bad Cop (Liam Neeson) by forcing the Bad Cop to squirt his own parents into a sticky state of being. (Hes really Bad.) Simple-minded Emmet with the help of a hodgepodge of master builders from Batman (Will Arnett) to a 1980s astronaut guy set off to rid the world of Kragle. The vivid computer animation mimics the look and feel of the beloved Lego blocks. During Emmets quest we wander through some familiar playsets -- the Wild West the Pirate Ship the original Space Ship set. Directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller ( Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs) who also wrote the screenplay do a remarkable job of creating worlds and a storyline that could easily come from the imaginations of youngsters. Metalbeard the Pirate for example is an amalgamation of all the leftover toys pieced together. In the end theres an unexpected heart-tugging moment with a surprisingly subtle performance by Ferrell that glues the whole film together. In a time when business-as-usual means downsizing its comforting to know that creativity and imagination can still save the day.

By Anthony Lane Eyad Hourani Adam Bakri and Leem Lubany in a film by Hany Abu-Assad.   Credit Illustration by Jashar Awan The Israeli submission for Best Foreign Language Film ahead of this years Academy Awards was ""Bethlehem"" a thriller about a young Palestinian man with links to terrorist activities who is secretly controlled by an Israeli handler. The Palestinian offering was ""Omar"" a thriller about a young Palestinian man with links to terrorist activities who is secretly controlled by an Israeli handler. Who said the two sides in the conflict have no common ground? If you can share a plot with your neighbor who knows what might yet bloom? In the event only ""Omar"" was picked as a nominee. It stars Adam Bakri as the Omar of the title a baker by trade and a good-looking guy as shown by a glowering closeup at the start. But he pales beside his beloved a student named Nadia (Leem Lubany) whose dark eyes in a film full of interrogation ask the most searching questions of all. She and Omar live on the West Bank kept apart from each other by the separation barrier that slices through their neighborhood. To them as to most Palestinians it is a twenty-six-foot-tall insult and Omars first deed is to scale the concrete bluff. To the Israelis who built it however it is a vital aid to security designed to block incursions by those who wish them ill. Omar it turns out is one of the wishers. That smolder we saw in the closeup was not so much romantic suspense with Nadia in mind as the slow burn of political frustration. So it is that one evening he steals a car and drives two comrades--Nadias brother Tarek (Eyad Hourani) and Amjad (Samer Bisharat) the smiling runt of the trio--to a vantage point from which Amjad shoots and kills an Israeli soldier. By any measure its a mad act achieving nothing and provoking a vengeance that proves to be swift and brutal but also spider-like in the subtlety of its means. Consider the tremendous back-to-back scenes in an Israeli jail. First Omar who has been pulled in as a suspect and tortured to no effect sits over trays of food with an older inmate a donnish type with spectacles a salty beard and a crocheted taqiyah on his head who warns him in Arabic of talking too much and predicts that if the authorities break you they will force you to collaborate in their schemes. ""I will never confess"" Omar says. ""Good good"" the man replies. Second Omar is led by guards to a shadowy room. In comes an Israeli in shirtsleeves bare-headed minus the spectacles but with the beard intact. Guess who. Mild of manner he produces a tape recorder replays Omars words from the meal (""I will never confess"") and says ""Thats a confession."" Checkmate. In short the games afoot. And it is a game--a murderous one set in motion by deep national urges of pride anxiety and self-determination but a game nonetheless. Back and forth we go across the wall with each party dicing for advantage. Omar is turned by the Israelis (or so they believe) and set free in his own community under orders to ""bring us what we need to catch the killer."" Omar for his part decides to double-cross his tormentors and attack them not realizing that they are infinitely wise to such maneuvers. And so on with the ground forever shifting under our feet and with everything--friendships weaponry sexual fidelity--up for grabs. The twists continue coiling to the final frame. This is a Palestinian film directed by Hany Abu-Assad and you are in no doubt as to where his sympathies lie or who will wind up on the losing team. What else can you hope for the movie asks among a people under perpetual siege? Given that attitude it would not be surprising if ""Omar"" made you feel morally bullied and yet as with Abu-Assads previous work ""Paradise Now"" (2005) which dramatized the even more inflammatory topic of suicide bombers that is not the legacy it leaves. For one thing you hardly have time to get backed into a corner ""Omar"" lasts ninety-eight minutes. Much of the story scampers along as does its limber hero who more than once has to negotiate the roofs and the alleyways of his home town with the law at his heels as if in training for a local reboot of the Jason Bourne franchise. But the quieter sections too seem curt and peeled-back (one spell of maltreatment in prison is implied by nothing more than the scrape of a heavy lamp against the floor) and there is a rueful economy to the way in which the director tracks the passing of time as Omar runs into trouble his face keeps acquiring fresh cuts and bruises and you wait for them to fade. Most of the actors are novices and though they struggle now and then with hokey dialogue they acquit themselves with a wiry conviction constantly glancing around for any threats. The villain is another matter. Abu-Assads film may be emotionally rooted in the Palestinian cause but he has the mettle and the sense of balance to yield the most fertile dramatic territory to the opposite camp. Rami the Israeli intelligence agent who deploys Omar is brought to life by the forbidding Waleed Zuaiter. Born in Sacramento raised in Kuwait and schooled at George Washington University Zuaiter is a regular on the New York stage. (In George Packers ""Betrayed"" based on an article written for this magazine he played an Iraqi translator.) Now as Rami Zuaiter is compact steady and impossible to outsmart--affable too although as with any spymaster you cant be sure if yet another front is being erected. At one point he chats with his wife and his mother on a cell phone in Hebrew sounding henpecked a timely comic belittling you assume. But then you notice that Omar too is watching him and you wonder if the comedy might not be camouflage intended to humanize the older man humor the younger one and thus break down his guard. Maybe its not Ramis wife on the line at all but another agent. And the lesson is trust nothing--not your eyes your ears or your instincts. Whether you should trust your God in these holy lands is up to you. Brick by brick the success of ""The Lego Movie"" mounts up. Two hundred million dollars and counting after a couple of weeks is a decent start although at first blush it may be hard to explain. All the main characters are Lego people which means that their physical mobility is pretty much confined to marching straight ahead and bending stiffly at the waist like Robert Mitchum in ""The Winds of War."" They show even less range in their expressions switching from a bewildered grimace to a shiny grin with nothing in between like Ali MacGraw in ""The Winds of War."" So wheres the appeal? Well our hero is Emmet (voiced by Chris Pratt) a construction worker who could not be more contented. He toils in a gleaming world watching the TV programs he is told to watch and drinking his appointed coffee; imagine if the Chaplin of ""Modern Times"" had loved his assembly line. As it was he craved escape whereas Emmet has to learn that his soul is being crushed before he can summon the need to do something about it. As you would expect this entails a journey wisdom culled from an elderly sage (Morgan Freeman) the snares of the evil Lord Business (Will Ferrell) and a piece of non-Legoid plastic with mysterious powers. To sum up ""Blah blah blah proper name place name backstory."" Such is the narrative as outlined by Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) a new friend of Emmets and it marks the moment at which ""The Lego Movie"" directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller shifts from a bubblegum blast to a rich self-conscious joke at the expense of our universal suckerdom. It is not a film about toys. It is a film about the willingness of people as both moviegoers and consumers to be toyed with. After all ""to call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions."" That is Karl Marx whom I would cheerfully have taken as a date to this movie not least for the thrill of seeing him in chunky 3-D glasses. How cool would they look with his beard? He would I think have applauded the precept that is issued here--namely that we should toss away the instructions in our Lego kits and cobble together whatever takes our fancy. (One mistake the film proposes that dads are obsessed with cleaving to Lego rules while their sons yearn to tip everything into a pile and get messy. In my experience its precisely the other way around.) Pursued to its logical extreme such revolutionary advice would mean never buying any new Lego but endlessly recycling our old stuff an excellent workout for the imagination and a nightmare for the marketing wonks at the company. Needless to say in the wake of a very funny film the last laugh will be theirs. Go to your Lego store or to the Web site and youll find the ""Creative Ambush"" package including a biplane thats also a Wild West saloon and a ""flying kebab stand"" that fires ""tasty kebab flick missiles""--just the kind of loosey-goosey left-field inventions that parents everywhere inspired by ""The Lego Movie"" would like their kids to devise. The kit retails for 39.99. It comes with instructions.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

"Lego Movie The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; lego-movie-the ) Lego Movie The (United States 2014) February 09 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli Legos. They seem to have been around forever (actually since 1949). As a kid some 40 years ago I can remember playing with them colored plastic bricks that snapped together. Since then the Lego empire has expanded venturing into arenas previously dominated by model kits and action figures. Now theres no need to combine Legos with other products to develop a bedroom floor adventure milieu - Lego produces everything. But toys were just the tip of the iceberg. Video games cartoons amusement parks and now a potential blockbuster movie have joined the fold. Over the past few years animated films have reached a nadir with promotional and box office considerations trumping all else. It has worked for the bean counters - high profile animated films are as close to ""gold"" as anything out there. Unfortunately the care and effort lavished on the genre during the 90s and 00s as Pixar rose like cream to the top has been missing in recent years. In particular the ""dual layer"" approach in which an animated film works on different levels for adults and kids has largely evaporated. Pixar hasnt made one of those since 2010s Toy Story 3 and in the interim weve seen only a few similar efforts from the other animation studios Despicable Me and Wreck-It Ralph in particular. Despite a generic marketing-friendly title The Lego Movie fills the breach nicely. Its not as complete and satisfying a film as the best of Pixar but its at least on par (and perhaps a little better) than some of the lesser post-Toy Story 3 efforts. This is truly a movie that children and their parents can both enjoy for different reasons. The Lego Movie boasts an over-the-top and childish base story but thats by intent. This is essentially the kind of imagination-fueled romp one might expect if a creative child was placed in a room with an unlimited quantity of Legos. The result would be spaceships explosions an overflow of pop culture icons and general mayhem. The movie attempts to replicate this but as is revealed in a third act twist theres more to things than initially meets the eye. The narrative thrust in the final 30 (or so) minutes gives The Lego Movie thematic heft. Older viewers will ponder father/son relationships and how the weight of ""adult concerns"" conspires to kill the child in all of us. Younger viewers may be perplexed by some of this but theyll still have a satisfying final confrontation to enjoy. The Lego Movie tells of the adventures of an average construction guy named Emmet (voice of Chris Pratt) who is mistaken for ""The Special"" a master builder prophesied to save the world. At the moment the world does in fact need saving because Lord Business (Will Ferrell) is putting into action a plan to destroy it. Accompanied by faithful companions Lucy (Elizabeth Banks) Batman (Will Arnett) and Vituvius (Morgan Freeman) Emmet seeks to fulfill his destiny while avoiding capture by Lord Business henchman Bad Cop (Liam Neeson). The films look should match the expectations of Lego fans. A certain ""clunkiness"" to the (pseudo) stop-motion aspects of the animation is intentional - the result of ensuring that every aspect of the landscape looks like it was assembled using Legos. When water floods a compartment its ""Lego water."" When fire erupts its ""Lego fire."" There are some exceptions late in the film but these come with explanations. Co-directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (Cloudy with a Chance for Meatballs) have taken a page out of the Legoland book and used virtual Legos to fill every nook and cranny of the film. Many of the high profile characters Lego has licensed over the years make appearances. The only one with a significant role is Batman who is played like a parody of Christian Bales interpretation (right down to the growling voice provided by Will Arnett). Superman Wonder Woman Green Lantern Gandalf Dumbledore Shaq and at least one of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have cameos. Like Batman they are comedic versions of their more serious non-Lego alter egos. A quartet of Star Wars characters also makes appearances C3PO Chewbacca Han and Lando. While voice actor Keith Ferguson is Han original actors Anthony Daniels and Billy Dee Williams lend their talents. Having seen the movie in 2-D I cant comment on the quality of the 3-D version but the 2-D prints are bright colorful and altogether pleasing to the eye. The only place where I noticed an obvious nod to 3-D viewing was during the opening credits. My guess is that this looks fine in 3-D and the format choice is a matter of personal preference (and a willingness to pay the extra money). The Lego Movie is a solid cinematic translation of the toys from which it gains its name. Although initially designed for children Legos have morphed into a means by which people of all ages can express their creativity. There are probably as many (or more) adults ""playing"" with Legos than children. This is acknowledged explicitly and implicitly in Lord and Millers screenplay and the experience of watching the movie will offer a satisfying 90 minutes regardless of the age of the viewer - right down to the hilarious final line.

"The Lego Movie - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire The Lego Movie Posted by Christy Lemire on February 9 2014 31 Comments Warner Bros. PG for mild action and rude humor. Running time 100 minutes. Four stars out of four. ""The Lego Movie"" Merely a great film or the greatest film ever in the history of cinema? I asked this question -- jokingly rhetorically -- during our What the Flick? review but the more I think about it the more in awe I am of the way ""The Lego Movie"" works on every level for every possible viewer. ""Everything Is Awesome"" isnt just an insanely catchy theme song one that will be stuck in your head for days if not weeks afterward (and may even drive out ""Let It Go"" from ""Frozen"" if youre lucky). Its a statement of fact. It may even be an understatement. Thats not a typo at the top -- I really am giving this movie four stars. You know that old cliched response after walking out of a movie or a play ""I laughed I cried""? This time its really true. I laughed my ass off -- and then I cried. A 3-D animated movie about a bunch of tiny pieces of plastic made me cry. And you guys who have read me for a while know that Im cold and soulless and not usually susceptible to the power of tearjerkery. But thats one of the many reasons I loved ""The Lego Movie"" so much It kept surprising me. Actually my husband Chris and I ended up liking the movie even better than Nicolas did -- and hes the one who was super-pumped to go see it inspired by the ubiquity of marketing all around town. (Warner Bros. You guys sure know how to reach your target audience of 4-year-olds.) It moves so beautifully it has such irresistible humor and irrepressible energy but always feels effortless. Its jammed with affectionate cheeky pop-culture references but never seems hacky or strains for the laugh; so many of the jokes fly by at such a giddily frenzied clip youll probably have to go see the movie a second time just to catch them all. And you probably wont mind doing that; ""The Lego Movie"" is the rare film based on a toy or a game that truly feels like its own unique universe rather than a shameless extended infomercial. Did we mention the voice cast? We havent even gotten to the exceptional voice cast yet. So often with animated movies the A-list stunt casting serves as a distraction and takes you out of the narrative. Here it provides one of the many opportunities for directors and co-writers Phil Lord and Christopher Miller to take established genre conventions and turn them on their heads similar to their inspired version of ""21 Jump Street."" Morgan Freeman for example plays a blind mystic whose prophecy sends an ordinary guy on an extraordinary heros journey. But in doing so he knowingly pokes fun at his propensity for playing God-like figures his rich voice providing both gravitas and goofy laughs. The increasingly endearing Chris Pratt provides the voice of Emmet a regular construction-worker drone who always follows the rules and does whats expected of him in his incessantly perky if regimented Lego town. Much of the humor comes from the way in which the characters world mirrors ours with its overpriced coffee crowded commutes idiotic sitcoms and overplayed radio tunes. Everything is awesome as the song goes but every day is exactly the same. But one day Emmet stumbles upon a random piece of red plastic thats unlike the rest of the interlocking bricks that surround him. It is the Piece of Resistance a crucial component of the prophecy that Freemans character Vitruvius told of at the beginning. And in finding it Emmet becomes known as The Special -- the one who will save the Lego universe from ultimate destruction. He gets help from a ragtag band of strangers including a bad-ass Goth chick who goes by the name Wyldstyle (an adorable Elizabeth Banks); Batman (Will Arnett doing a Batman version of his pompous ""Arrested Development"" character Gob); a makeshift pirate captain called Metal Beard (Nick Offerman); and the unflappably happy Unikitty (Alison Brie) which is -- you guessed it -- half unicorn and half kitty. They must outsmart and outrun the evil President Business better known as Lord Business who wants the piece for himself to maintain order and separation between all the Lego realms. So yeah hes kind of a fascist tyrant. But in the hands of Will Ferrell hes also hilariously self-serious. President Business right-hand man is the two-faced Good Cop/Bad Cop (Liam Neeson) who dons whichever persona he must to get the job done and keep everyone in line. ""The Lego Movie"" message of thinking for yourself and trying new things may sound a lot like theme of  ""The Croods"" last year but it presents this notion in a much more lively and clever manner. A great deal of that has to do with the look of the animation which is beautiful in its crudeness. While the images are computer-generated they have the intentionally jumpy rough-hewn look of stop-motion animation -- as if the effects team had moved brick by brick painstakingly by hand to create the sensation of motion. Everything is made of Legos from the people and vehicles to water and bullets. It is an endless joy to watch and the fact that some of the pieces and characters faces have a chip or a smudge here or there adds to the charm. Just when you may start feeling like this zippy thrill ride of a movie is exhausting you it takes a third-act turn that you probably never would have seen coming. I wouldnt dream of giving anything away about it. But I will say that its daring profound and emotionally powerful in a way that caught me completely off guard -- especially sitting in the theater with my 4-year-old son curled up in my lap.

Good message hilarious jokes and imaginative animation. Probably the best toy based movie since the first Toy Story Reply February 10 2014  by  David     Very well-written review Easy to understand and has some heart in it  -David Reply February 10 2014  by  Anonymous     Im so excited to see this movie But it seems as though its more suited to teens and adults than actual children. Reply February 11 2014  by  Diogo     Thanks for the review. I was definitively feeling exhausted and kind of boring through the whole movie until the end came to play and it was a big turn around for good. Very powerful and well written ending. Reply February 13 2014  by  Charles     Im wondering if the subsequent sequels can live up to this ones awesomeness Reply February 15 2014  by  jeff     have just come back from watching 3d version. the theatre was not full but laughter was all around but quiet at the right points. the section the reviewer does not mention brought tears to my eyes and I am 47. fantastic film. the Lego ocean with the pirate ship is stunning. Reply Pingback - February 16 2014  by  david ramirez     Once more going to the cinema with high expectations hoping not to be dissapointed Reply February 17 2014  by  Howie     I took a couple of 10 year old boys. They liked it. I thought it was enjoyable until the parallelism/live action segments. They totally lost me at that point. Thats a plot device Ive always detested - actually throwing out a 12 issue comic series because it ended in such a fashion. Wait for it to be at Redbox for a free rental. Reply September 21 2014  by  april     May I suggest maybe watching it again? U know from Redbox... I was pleasantly surprised by that particular twist at the end. Its just my opinion and I realize you dont know me lol but Ive noticed that there are a great many people who werent confused by that part at all including myself. I believe that it blended well with the rest of the story if you were following along...? Reply December 20 2014  by  Helge     Thanks for the big huge massive SPOILER. Reply February 20 2014  by  Mike     Good for kids with the unique animation but may have resonated better with adults if ""lord government"" was the underyling theme by using the old style lego pieces used for constructing bland dark dreary Soviet style government housing with workers ""following the rules"" with no personal choice or life and the resistance would have been the freedom fighters in that case similar to themes of the classic animated anti-collectivist movie ""Antz"". Lego could have made itself look justified then for issuing the huge variety of modern kits because many parents long for the simple blocks that leave the imagination up to the kids. Instead lego took a different tact and decided to make fun of itself as ""lord business"" with its ""pre-themed kits follow the instructions"".. etc although it did depict a lively vibrant city in the beginning. Teasing the city dwellers choosing to buy expensive coffee and listening to Beyonce type mindless music was cute. Reply March 15 2014  by  Mark     I went to this movie with low expectations and I left feeling like the reviewer that this movie is a gem. I disagree with Mike. The corporate theme was current and very familiar to us. The filmmakers hit just about every note perfectly. And the message part of the story is more profound than many reviews I have read. My take on the message is that we have allowed corporations to control our lives to such an extent that it puts all of us in danger; which is overcome by everyone realizing their own ""specialness"" by contributing each special strength to an organized plan for liberation. This is the path of redemption for even the President/Lord Business. It speaks simply yet profoundly for each of us today. Reply September 21 2014  by  april     Well said...or written lol. I also disagree with Mike. Reply March 29 2014  by  Carolyn     Most of the adult viewing audience is talking on one of two smartphone brands drinking 7.00 Starbucks Frappucinos and watching the same three or four hit cable series so Emmets world resonated with us in a way that your storyline would not have (plus as you note ""Antz"" kind of did that already). One of the many things I took away from this movie (and like Christy I cried) is that many of us just follow the instructions on the kits -- they arent as blatant as in Emmets world but we just do what society expects and we follow the paths that have already been trodden into ruts by thousands of feet before us. The Master Builders dont do that; they think of what they want or need and then they simply create it even if it means breaking the rules and blasting tradition. Martha Graham Bill Gates and Steve Jobs Orville and Wilbur Wright Pharell Williams (yes Im serious) -- these are just a few of humanitys Master Builders and we all have the potential to be The Special if we acknowledge our own creativity and strengths and give reign to them. Reply September 21 2014  by  april     Thank you for your post I agree with your viewpoint regarding this enjoyable movie I just wish I could express myself in writing as you do Great job Reply February 22 2014  by  Emmy     Bi-polar. Seriously. Someone as seemingly intelligent as you couldnt come up with a better way to discribe the cop Lego. This mental illness advocates says pick up a thesaurus Reply March 1 2014  by  Mike D NYC     Hey Emmy Seriously discribe? Its spelled d-e-s-c-r-i-b-e. And how bout a question mark after ""cop Lego"" not a period? Plus are you saying youre a mental illness advocate? Who in her right mind is an advocated of mental illness? Reply April 5 2014  by  Bret     I would like to comment on some things here. I would like to say I too loved the movie and liked your review until you described a character (Good Cop/Bad Cop) as having Bipolar because he switched personalities. I feel this statement leads to misconceptions and bias against people with Bipolar disorder. According to the Diagnostic and statistical manual for mental disorders Bipolar is a mood disorder not a personality disorder. I feel the diagnosis that would fit this character is Dissociative Identity Disorder (fka multiple personality disorder). To answer your question on who advocates for mental illness I do. I advocate for the fair treatment of people in society regardless of their disability. Reply April 28 2014  by  Bianca     How rude are you? By the way that was a rhetorical question. You are not required to answer it. If you think that insulting someone for their spelling and typing skills make you a better person than they are think again. I also am an advocate for people with a mental illness. Reply February 23 2014  by  Cheryl     That was the worst movie Ive seen ever. The 2 9yr olds I took thought it was stupid too. The nerds behind us were laughing hysterically at a stupid eyebrow raise. We just didnt get why this was rated so high by all of the critics. Total let down. Reply February 23 2014  by  Michael     I agree. I was thinking this may have been the worst movie Ive ever seen. Hardly funny. My friend who went with me agreed as did her 10-year-old. Reply March 29 2014  by  Carolyn      Cheryl and Michael Im sorry you didnt enjoy the movie (I cant believe that you werent even impressed the least bit by the incredibly skillful animation but we must move on) but if this is the worst movie youve ever seen you are living the good life. So that you may gain perspective I recommend viewing Weird Al Yankovics ""UHF"" Keenan Ivory and Damon Wayans ""Blankman"" and/or Brendan Fraser in ""Monkeybone."" Reply February 23 2014  by  Christy Lemire     Worst movie youve ever seen Cheryl and Michael? Clearly you guys have never seen an Adam Sandler movie. (Thanks for sharing your thoughts though) Reply February 24 2014  by  Michael     I try and avoid Adam Sandler movies. Reply June 3 2014  by  Brandon     Probably a safe precaution. As for Cheryl and Michael you are obviously trying to anger people with your reviews. As for me this is the best non-Disney/Pixar kids movie (Come to think of it theres not many non-Disney/Pixar kids movies out there). Better than a good portion of all the Disney movies out there. Reply February 23 2014  by  JoyousMN     Best movie Ive seen in a long time By the (very awesome) ending it began to remind me of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Reply Pingback The Lego Movie March 1 2014  by  Aaron     the unflappably happy Unikitty I see her more as ""flappably happy"" Reply September 13 2014  by  Kurt     This movie completely blew me away. The Netflix DVD arrived and my wife looked at me like ""What were you thinking with this?"" I said ""hey it had stellar reviews and you know Im a LEGO maniac lets give it a chance."" We have since watched it three times just to catch all the references and were both wandering around the house belting out ""EVERYTHING IS AWESOME"" It was the most entertaining sublimely brilliant film I have seen in years. Ignore the trolls drop everything youre doing and see it now. I guaranteed you wont be disappointed. This review hit the nail on the head perfectly its quite possibly one of the ten best films in the history of cinema. I know that sounds nuts but its true. Reply January 10 2015  by  fluffydipper     I completely agree The Lego Movie is for sure the best animated feature of all time Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

George Clooneys Monuments Men should prepare to be shot down. The brightly-imagined Lego Movie is also a wickedly smart and funny free-for-all and sassy enough to shoot well-aimed darts at corporate branding. Satirical subversion in family entertainment is an unexpected treat especially in a movie that also functions as a triumph of product placement. For plot we get Chris Pratt voicing a block of plastic called Emmet Brickowski a construction worker who follows the rules until hes enlisted to rebel against President Business (Will Ferrell) to take down the forces against spontaneity so we can all create our own universe preferably with Legos. Or something like that. The movie designed with flair to spare by Chris Miller and Philip Lord the creators of Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs has so much energy it sometimes spins out of control.

Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size Christopher Orr Feb 7 2014 Culture Warner Bros.My life trajectory has twice intersected with that of the Lego Group in the 1970s when I was a boy; and over the past several years now that I have a boy of my own. Its an open question which of us--I or the building blocks--has evolved further during that span. The Legos of my youth were relatively straightforward brightly colored blocks with their immediately recognizable logo-bearing dimples some longer some shorter some flatter some wider. Like most of my contemporaries I assiduously built a little Lego town blue for the police station and cruisers; red for the firehouse and ladder-trucks; and green for grass. Otherwise the blocks were largely interchangeable and the particular buildings or vehicles to be made with them largely subject to imagination.Related Story You Can Do Anything Must Every Kids Movie Reinforce the Cult of Self-Esteem? The Legos of today resemble those primitive specimens in much the way an iPhone resembles a telegraph. The pieces are vastly more specialized (complex hinges working gears) the colors innumerable (the available shades of gray may fall short of 50 but not by much) and the designs--frequently based on media properties such as Star Wars or Harry Potter--bewildering in their complexity. The market logic is inescapable rather than have one bin of simple blocks from which to construct more or less anything my son has quite a few sets each of which can be assembled into an extraordinarily detailed Republic Frigate say or Battle of Endor diorama but none of which are terribly well suited to building anything else.Its no small irony then that the moral of The Lego Movie repeated frequently and emphatically is Dont follow the instructions Let your imagination run wild Which is not at all to say that its a bad movie--its actually a total gas--rather that its message is that we should do as Lego says not as Lego does. But then consistency is the hobgoblin of little international toy conglomerates.The Lego Movie tells the story of Emmet (voiced by Chris Pratt) an ordinary construction-worker mini-figure toiling away in the conformist dystopia of Bricksburg. Not that he minds in the least Its up in the morning a quick shower under pale blue Lego studs a 37 cup of coffee and then off to a days work building skyscrapers of Burj Khalifan splendor all the while singing along to the pop ditty ""Everything is awesome everything is cool when youre one of the team."" (If Mustapha Mond had written jingles this is what theyd sound like.) There are directions for everything and Emmet always follows the directions.That is until he tumbles down a hole at the construction site and finds himself mesmerized by a strange red rectangular prism not of this (Lego) world. This is the ""piece of resistance"" and its discovery may or may not mean that Emmet is ""the special""--one chosen by fate to defeat the evil despot Lord Business (Will Ferrell) before he can complete the diabolical plot he has scheduled for Taco Tuesday.Emmet soon finds himself among the Master Builders intent on overthrowing Lord Business a motley crew that include the tough gal Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) an Obi-Wan-ish wizard named Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) the pirate-cyborg Metalbeard (Nick Offerman) a ""1980-something space guy"" named Benny (Charlie Day) the pinkly perky Uni-Kitty (Alison Brie) and Batman (Will Arnett). (Additional cameos include Channing Tatum as Superman Jonah Hill as Green Lantern Cobie Smulders as Wonder Woman Will Forte as Abraham Lincoln and in one of the films most winning sequences Billy Dee Williams as--who else?--Lando Calrissian.)The movies message is that we should do as Lego says not as Lego does.The good guys hopscotch across Lego-verses--The Old West Middle Zealand Cloud Cuckoo Land--desperate to stay ahead of Lord Businesss chief henchman Bad Cop (Liam Neeson) and prevent the tyrant from using such anti-Lego artifacts as the Sword of Exact Zero (an Exact-o knife) the Ban-Da-Id (you get the idea) and worst of all the dreaded Kragle (this one youll have to see for yourself). All the while Emmets compatriots are deconstructing and reconstructing Lego objects left and right reinventing their surroundings in a blur of geometric whimsy. The hope is that Emmet will somehow unlock his own potential as a Master Builder. But the signs are not promising with the erstwhile instructions-follower remaining stubbornly fixated on a design he came up with for a double-decker couch.Goofy? Extremely. But The Lego Movie is a ball from start to finish stuffed full of gags with trans-generational appeal. Co-directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 21 Jump Street) keep the plot moving briskly with only a slight sag toward the end as the narrative veers meta. The vocal performances are a delight in particular those by Freeman Neeson and Arnett. And the visuals are amusing and inventive even though (alas) the animation is computer-generated rather than stop-motion.Is it a touch off-message that--in connection with this giddy paean to individual imagination and not following instructions--Lego is releasing a series of complex movie-themed construction sets (The Getaway Glider Cloud Cuckoo Palace etc.)? Well yes it is. But what can you do? Its strictly business. Lord Business.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen.

After Khizr Khan spoke politicians and commentators on most networks said they were moved humbled inspired choked up.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue.

Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

"Those Hollywood Dumpuary Blues << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com  Previous The Last Skate Atelier  Next A Visit From the Goon Squad Facebook Twitter Print Movies Those Hollywood Dumpuary Blues One great doc cant stop the fall of Monuments Men or the cynicism of The Lego Movie by Wesley Morris on February 7 2014 Theres an audience for The Monuments Men. Its a WWII drama in which George Clooney assembles a team of curators historians and museum directors turns them into soldiers and devises a plan to stop the Nazis from stealing Europes great art. Matt Damon Bill Murray John Goodman and Bob Balaban play the art experts. So do Jean Dujardin of The Artist and Hugh Bonneville of Downton Abbey. Cate Blanchett makes long faces as a Parisian conscripted into doing clerical work for the SS. Clooney directed and cowrote this movie with his creative partner Grant Heslov. (Its based on a real years-long mission -- the Monuments Fine Arts and Archives program -- that Robert M. Edsel documented in a pair of books about purloined treasure during the war.) Clooney applies an unflagging chumminess to nearly every scene. Its the war film his astronaut from Gravity would have made. The camaraderie is played for gentle laughs. The score by Alexandre Desplat imitates the music in old Hollywood battle pictures -- woodwinds pip brasses gleam tubas fart. When Clooneys character Frank Stokes a dashing conservator delivers a speech about the crux of the operation -- to save the soul of civilization -- a piano twinkles behind him. The whole movie has an unbearable lightness. As I said theres an audience for this movie. But that audience lives in 1964. That might strike some moviegoers as complimentary. It might flatter Clooney too. Hes directed five films. This one is the spiritual twin of his 2008 football screwball Leatherheads -- both strive to embody bygone entertainment just not artisanally. These arent vintage re-creations the way youd get with a younger director who just discovered say The Dirty Dozen. Theyre not the explosive revisions of Quentin Tarantino either. With Clooney these throwbacks arent out to unpack antique craftsmanship or correct long-standing thematic problems. With him its The Dirty Dozen with even less dirt. The film spans more than two years from the winter of 1943 to the spring of 1945. Yet whenever a new time card stamps the screen youre forced to ask where all those months went. Because descriptive filmmaking doesnt come easily to Clooney the characters actually have to explain everything. The men make their way around Europe in search of a couple of key pieces including Michelangelos Madonna of Bruges. But Clooney doesnt attach to the art any personal meaning or wonder. That sort of melodrama is beside the point to him. Or maybe its been forced to seem beside the point. I cant think of another movie that feels as simultaneously rushed and leisurely. There are three good sequences -- one in a clearing with Goodman Dujardin and a horse; another with Murray and Balaban experiencing a stroke of luck in a farmhouse; the third puts one of the men on a land mine. The first two could have been elevated to greatness with some patience just playing out the rhythm to enrich the suspense. That third sequence is perfect as it is yet by the time it happens all the jolliness and sense of moral purpose have drained the movie of real tension. The Monuments Men feels like the intersection of The Good German and the three Oceans capers all of which Steven Soderbergh directed all of which feature Clooney. This is a film that could have used a little of Soderberghs chilliness to cut the mirth. Warren Beatty is the actor who produces and directs to whom Clooney has often been compared. Theyre both liberals whose movies veer between politics and old-Hollywood fluff -- two of Clooneys other dramas were about Edward R. Murrow and a juicy presidential campaign. But Beattys grip on a genre was sure enough for him to riff on it. I think Clooney sees filmmaking as an opportunity to wag his finger -- at philistines at the past at the present. Theres some subversion in that approach. Entertainment runs a distant second to point making. He seemed to know that the campaign movie of his The Ides of March from 2011 was trash. The trash is what some of us wanted but he was ultimately too tasteful to dignify our lust. He tried to shame politics and us. Thats the frustration with Clooney. His father Nick is a journalist film historian and politician. As a director Clooney flatters his father who plays an older version of Stokes briefly toward the end. The apples still hanging on the tree. Its not for nothing that Clooney has cast himself as the conservator in The Monuments Men. Hes making the sort of movie no one makes anymore. Hes the keeper of several flames. But in doing so hes thinking past the audience and into Senate hearings and Festschrifts. Hes rigorously wow-averse. His films dramatize the distance between confidence and certitude and how the latter denies any possibility of true levity or surprise. The Murrow movie 2005s Good Night and Good Luck worked more or less because its moralizing came from the mouth of a moralist. It was resonant ventriloquism. Still you never exit a George Clooney film satisfied that youve watched a movie. You go home feeling like youve just signed a petition. The Monuments Men had been placed on last years holiday schedule and was moved off the Hollywood version of benching a star player. Seeing it now you understand why. Sometimes a perfectly competent film simply doesnt come together in that alchemical way that a merely good movie needs to. Nothing blooms. This is the historical movie I think people feared Ben Afflecks Argo would be fine scenes that dont add up. Part of the enthusiasm for the film had to do with the surprise (and relief) that Affleck whos really the modern Beatty had pulled it off. Something bloomed. Thats a cosmic-industrial reason for how The Monuments Men has been handled. Theres also the simple reality that Clooney and Heslov have misguided the movie to almost ideological ends. This is essentially an action-adventure film. But Clooney plays it as a tract. Once again hes appealing to our better selves with a work of classicism. But the trouble with his ideas of the classics is that they dont feel as if hes learning anything. Hes lecturing. The Monuments Men actually opens and closes with Clooney behind a lectern pointing to images on a screen. That captures the George Clooney moviegoing experience. Leave the popcorn. Bring a notebook.  It seems almost unfair to open a WWII trifle like The Monuments Men which is careful to graze the particulars of the Holocaust in the same week a new Claude Lanzmann documentary arrives. But The Last of the Unjust has begun making its way around the country with its nearly four-hour running time; outrageously compelling subject Benjamin Murmelstein; and tour de force discourse. Murmelstein was an Austrian Jew forced by Adolf Eichmann into the terrible assignment of helping run the Theresienstadt Ghetto. In 1975 Lanzmann met with Murmelstein for a series of interviews that went mostly unused for his Holocaust landmark Shoah. The nest of moral and ethical questions raised by Murmelsteins role at the camp warrants the full Lanzmann treatment. I wrote about the film last spring and my feelings about it havent changed. It still has an inexorable force. Murmelstein meanwhile proves a vexing encryption of a man even to a master prosecutor like Lanzmann. The central debates about culpability and betrayal are riveting wearing and finally depressing. Clooneys movie searches ruins looking for art. Lanzmanns art arises from scouring adjacent atrocity in pursuit of answers. His documentary doesnt deserve an audience so much as demand one.  When does an animated family movie have to surrender to the realities of family entertainment? Can it be too cool for its own good? I thought about that while watching The Lego Movie. By family standards it is first an epic of sorts. The films been made to seem as if it were built entirely of Lego blocks and pieces. The simulation mixes computer animation a kind of stop-motion and what appears to be the painstaking manual labor of working with actual Legos. And the effects occasionally produce magic -- like whenever water and suds run they gush as tiny Lego bricks. Often though the simulation just seems well simulated. But the film itself has the archness of something aimed at people predisposed to despise a smart fitfully earnest movie like Frozen. Cynicism drives The Lego Movie. It focuses on a himbo construction worker named Emmet (Chris Pratt) whos mistaken as a savior akin to Neo in The Matrix. Emmets dragged all over Lego Land by a questing punk named Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) and a holy Moses called Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) just like the ancient Roman architect. Theyre joined by a split-personality Hello Kitty-like cat (Alison Brie) a goofball spaceman (Charlie Day) and a pirate (Nick Offerman) operating what could be a Jaeger from Pacific Rim. Theyre all trying to stop an egomaniacal CEO from taking over the world. Hes a suit on stilts called President Business. His voice belongs to Will Ferrell and the red tie and wooden manner would seem to belong to Mitt Romney. His henchman is another dual personality played by Liam Neeson. They all move with the blockish gracelessness you expect from a Lego figurine. The directors are Phil Lord and Christopher Miller the pair responsible for the shocking hilarity of the 21 Jump Street movie. I laughed at this movie too. Freeman and Neeson find their respective self-parody sweet spots and the whole thing is almost stolen by a narcissistic Batman played by Will Arnett with his voice scraping the earth. But I got tired of laughing which never happened with 21 Jump Street. It wasnt the idea of a studio raiding its vault for satire (most of the fictional references Ive mentioned are Warner Bros. properties even loosely Hello Kitty). It wasnt the idea that the movie is just a commercial for Legos though I did think seriously more than once about how fun it might be to build myself a city some weekend. I stopped laughing because after 20 minutes Id had enough. The conceit gets stale fast. If Michel Gondrys all-Lego music video for the White Stripes ""Fell in Love With a Girl"" had lasted 100 minutes the tidal wave of joy you get from that clip would dissipate and all you would be is wet. Id had enough of the cynicism too. The movie wants to mock adventure movies and cartoons and disrespect family movies with ""whatever dude"" cool Emmet is an almost self-admitted idiot whos happier being a drone. You sense that Lord and Miller want to make another piece of gonzo vulgarity something ironically riotously lewd like Trey Parker and Matt Stones all-marionette Team America World Police. But The Lego Movie is as far as the studio would allow them to go. Any real anarchy actually feels suppressed. So you doubt its sincerity. Once the film breaks into a long would-be climactic live-action interlude with Ferrell as a neglectful dad I threw my hands up. Emmet tells Wyldstyle ""I never have any ideas."" Lord and Miller run out of fresh ones fast.  It does of course feel churlish to complain about an animated movie this physically ambitious and fun (while it lasts) when something as dreary and heartless as The Nut Job is out there. This movie purports to be a caper adventure featuring park rodents trying to steal sacks of nuts from human gangsters. The whole thing looks like a video game youd rather not play. There are poor nut puns an idiot bulldog and two heists that take too long to execute. Theres also a curiously erotic moment in which the hero -- a sour selfish squirrel (Arnett again) -- stops pushing away his mute rat friend and makes unexplained eye contact with him for several long seconds. Some other characters break up the moment and the squirrel pushes the rat out of the frame. Thats not even subtext. I saw The Nut Job with a 5-year-old whos newly obsessed with giving his food and movies star ratings. He spent the walk home wondering aloud why the gangsters were shooting guns and why the movie ended with a cartoon Psy doing ""Gangnam Style"" over the closing credits. For a child that is the musical equivalent of putting bacon on a manure sandwich. ""Two stars"" cried my 5-year-old friend. How this movie happened at all is far more perplexing than the failure of Clooneys movie. With animated childrens entertainment weve reached a point at which quality might not matter at all. If you can keep the price tag down (The Nut Job has already grossed more than its reported 42 million budget) theres money to be made no matter how junky and derivative it is. Even the voice work is miserable. Neeson villainous again joins Arnett and a miscast Katherine Heigl. Arnett and Neeson sound as if theyre having the time of their lives in The Lego Movie. Here they sound like they want to hide. They should.

The Lego Movie (PG) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Lego Movie (PG) A frantic funny comedy inspired by the popular building-block toys. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com2/6/2014 Editor rating 3 Instead of capitalizing on a beloved toy The Lego Movie uses the popular childrens building blocks and miniature figures for something far more ambitious A manic and surprising comedy that has more imagination and creativity than all the Transformers pictures combined. In their third collaboration writers-directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 21 Jump Street) continue to hone the frantic pace and endearing silliness of their previous films. These guys not only know how to come up with an endless assortment of gags They also have the timing of a stand-up comic using precise editing and unexpected pop culture references to heighten what is already a deliriously fun movie. The ingenious plot is a huge in-joke for the worldwide cult of Lego fanatics although the movie takes a while to reveal its grand design. The premise is simple An evil mastermind President Business (voiced by Will Ferrell) has seized control of the universe and fooled everyone into thinking their lives are great. They all watch the hit TV sitcom Where Are My Pants? which consists of the same joke told over and over; sing the same pop song Everything is Awesome (a ditty as catchy as a piece of gum on your shoe); buy insanely overpriced coffee; and go about their jobs merrily. But then a construction worker named Emmett (Chris Pratt) is shown a potential new universe where all the pieces dont have to fit together the way the instructions say by a fiery heroine Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) who happens to be dating Batman (Will Arnett). A huge part of the fun in The Lego Movie is watching all the different properties that have been licensed to the toy makers cross paths in the same movie Gandalf Superman Abraham Lincoln Wonder Woman Han Solo and a slew of others figure in the plot (one running gag involves The Green Lantern voiced by Jonah Hill and how nobody ever wants to be around him perhaps a stab at how poorly the characters live-action movie fared a few summers ago). But the movies secret weapon is the vividly detailed world Lord and Miller have created for their characters stuffing the screen with so many visual puns and easter eggs you often want to hit the pause button to take it all in. And just like they did in their previous two films Lord and Miller insert sentiment and heart into their knockabout comedy knowing movies are funniest when you care about their protagonists -- even if theyre tiny pieces of plastic. Voices Chris Pratt Elizabeth Banks Will Ferrell Morgan Freeman Nick Offerman Will Arnett Alison Brie Nick Offerman Charlie Day Jonah Hill Channing Tatum. Writers-directors Phil Lord Christopher Miller. Producers Ron Lee Dan Lin A Warner Bros. release. Running time 110 minutes. Mild Lego violence. Opens Friday Feb. 7 at area theaters.

The bombast of the G.I. Joe and Transformers franchises might suggest no but after an uninspired year for animated movies The Lego Movie is a 3-D animated film that connects as an homage to the ingenious Danish-born construction game along with a subversively flippant story about thinking outside the blocks. AP Photo Video Video Weekend movie pick Even adults will love the Lego Movies humour Optimus Prime is shown in a scene from ""Transformers Dark of the Moon."" AP Multimedia Lego and more Five unforgettable movies inspired by the toy box Co-director and screenwriters Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 21 Jump Street) borrow the reverence of Pixars Wall-E and the rude fun of Trey Parker and Matt Stones Team America World Police to create a movie thats fast-paced and silly with enough throwaway clever in-jokes for their accompanying adults to justify a second viewing.The plot which is a parody of a dystopian science fiction story along the lines of Tron or The Matrix focuses on an unexceptional mini-figure construction worker Emmet (voiced by Chris Pratt).Emmet has spent his life in the skyscraper-filled city of Bricksburg living by the instruction manual (""Root for the local sports team. Dont forget to smile. Always return a compliment."") Each night he watches the same laugh-tracked sitcom Wheres My Pants? Each day he works a construction job listening to the anthem Everything Is Awesome (an actually awesome Auto-Tuned bubblegum ear worm from the Calgary sister duo Tegan and Sara with a rap break from Andy Sambergs Lonely Island trio.) Then one afternoon at the end of his shift he discovers that the future of his square-cornered world depends on him abandoning his code of conformity.After taking a tumble at his job site Emmet discovers a red cylinder known as the ""piece of resistance"" is stuck to his back and he meets a ninja rebel with coloured punk stripes in her hair Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks). Shes part of a revolutionary movement under the leadership of a blind master-building sage Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman). Theyre out to save the Lego-verse from President Business (voiced by Will Ferrell) who plans to cement the mix-and-match Lego blocks into a fixed state using a binding substance called Kragle.Kragle (a tube of Krazy Glue with some letters obscured) is one of the brand-name ""relics"" that have fallen into the Lego world including a Band-Aid a Q-tip and and X-Acto knife a.k.a. ""The Exact-Zero."" These household items are related to the Man Upstairs whose unseen hand (at least until the movies end) rules this busy little plastic world.Under the supervision of animator Chris McKay (Robot Chicken) the visual style and the message are both tied to how a limited means of expression can produce a profusion of creative possibilities. Everything onscreen is constructed from bricks gears wheels and mini-figures including a heaving ocean. President Businesss chief enforcer is Bad Cop/Good Cop (Liam Neeson) whose swivelling head has a smile painted on one side and a frown on the other.Over the years numerous brands have been sublicensed by Lego to create popular mini-figures many of whom make an appearance here. They include DC Comics Superman and Wyldstyles pompous boyfriend Batman (Will Arnett) as well as wizards from Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings Abraham Lincoln the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and NBA star Shaquille ONeal (who provides his own voice). Theres an Old West set pirate-themed scenes and a psychedelic realm of mix-and-match Lego creations called Cloud Cuckooland where the space cadet empress Uni-Kitty (Alison Brie) is a cross between a unicorn and kitten.No doubt there is an uncomfortable number of logos being marketed to kids in the The Lego Movie along with the obvious one thats in the title but the film as a whole is very much in the spirit of Cloud Cuckooland Its a place where the use of X-Acto blades and Krazy Glue breaks the rules but almost everything else goes.

What could easily have been test-marketed corporate-processed crap a branding extravaganza pretending to be a movie instead becomes a surprisingly enjoyable and satisfyingly dense family entertainment that pays tribute to the spirit of free play and individuality. But OK hang on Its a branding extravaganza too and also a fable of highly contingent liberation in which we surface from one constrained and constricting universe into another. Do you want me to just relax and let you enjoy a mainstream animated film thats better and cleverer than it needed to be or do you want me to go deep and dark and overthink it a lot? Thanks I thought so - you guys are awesomeIndeed ""Everything Is Awesome"" as the deliberately idiotic and insanely catchy theme song to ""The LEGO Movie"" puts it. (""Blue skies bouncy springs/ We just named you awesome things/ A Nobel Prize a piece of string/ You know whats awesome? Everything"") Written (in the non-LEGO universe) by Devo founder Mark Mothersbaugh and performed by pop duo Tegan and Sara with the Lonely Island its the only song ever played on the only radio station anyone listens to in the all-LEGO world of Emmet (voiced by Chris Pratt) an anonymous LEGO figurine and construction worker whose only concern is to follow instructions. As a sinister LEGO law-enforcement robot intones with the song playing at a tense juncture ""That is my jam."" (""That is also my jam"" responds his partner delivering a LEGO-claw fist-bump.)We see through the hypocrisy and bogus good cheer of Emmets universe at once just as were meant to. Everything is non-awesome Emmet is a desperately lonely failed conformist and the apparently benevolent President Business (Will Ferrell) is actually a tyrant devoted to blowing up ""everything weird"" and replacing it with soulless and interchangeable late-modernist LEGO skyscrapers. (In other words hes Mike Bloomberg.) As weve already learned from the movies prologue President Business is actually the evil Lord Business and only a mysterious non-LEGO object called the ""Piece of Resistance"" can defeat his apocalyptic secret weapon known as the Kragle. We pick up some pretty big clues about issues in the extra-LEGO universe as we move along but never mind that for now.Furthermore as a blind wizard-type figurine called Vitruvius (voiced by Morgan Freeman in witty laconic style) helpfully explains ""There is a prophecy."" OK its a threadbare prophecy that feels a bit like Vitruvius made it up on the spot He who finds the Piece of Resistance will be the Special a ""master builder"" of awesome power who will unite the other master builders Avengers-style and bring down the despotic rule of Lord Business. This Frodo/Harry/Neo figure is of course Emmet who stumbles upon the nonstandard Piece of Resistance and upon a rebellious punk-flavored female figurine who calls herself Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) at virtually the same moment. She warns Emmet right away that shes got a boyfriend and that its ""super serious"" but does not explain that said boyfriend is actually Batman or rather the self-absorbed Goth-flavored LEGO version of Batman as voiced by Will Arnett.All of this is delivered rapid-fire zinger after zinger -- much too fast for most kid viewers Id say -- while trying to straddle the boundary between adventure epic and outright mockery. Visual allusions to fantasy or action movies some of the adult and teen audience has seen come fast and furious (see what I did there?) from the ""Dark Knight"" series to ""Lord of the Rings"" to (not kidding) ""City of Lost Children."" And of course ""The Matrix"" hangs over this movie as it does over all postmodern escape fables about a constructed universe and humanitys necessarily failed attempts to come face to face with itself God and the nature of reality. Even the specific situation of the first ""Matrix"" film is emulated and satirized here. There is officially no race in the LEGO universe where everyone is lemon-yellow (and everything is awesome) but even here we encounter the white Everyman being told by an African-American sage that he is unique is in fact the location of rupture in a universe of sameness. You Might Also Like Lets consider the animation style of ""The LEGO Movie"" which is ingenious and even brilliant but is also delivered beneath a scrim of mystification. It looks like stop-motion animation using LEGO bricks and figurines and every physical object you see in Emmets world appears to be made of LEGO pieces even the surface of the ocean and the flames from exploding police cars. But theyre not and in fact none of those objects are physical at all. What we see is actually simulated stop-motion using meticulously rendered 3-D digital representations of LEGO bricks and assemblies; objects that hypothetically or theoretically could exist but do not. Its a simulacrum of a simulacrum an ideal copy of a plastic universe. Inside a movie which we watch in a multiplex attached to a shopping center in a LEGO-like sprawl ... you see where Im going with this.Im not hectoring anybody about how they shouldnt enjoy the exhilarating pop-culture mashup of ""The LEGO Movie"" as in the convention of master builders that pulls together Gandalf Dumbledore Superman (Channing Tatum) the overly friendly Green Lantern (Jonah Hill) Abe Lincoln in his jet-propelled chair and the 2002 L.A. Lakers version of Shaquille ONeal (voiced by himself). In the films best moments writing-directing duo Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (also the team behind ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs"" and ""21 Jump Street"") convey a freewheeling almost libidinal energy that really does fit the open-ended spirit of those venerable Danish interlocking bricks. But even in delivering the message that Lord Business fetish for order is not the true Way of LEGO there are limits. LEGO long ago forged corporate partnerships with Marvel Disney Lucasfilm DC Comics Warner Bros. and so on and those interests are protected. You definitely dont see Batman or Gandalf taken apart and reassembled with insect arms and bulldozer treads. Theres a heartwarming and manipulative third-act revelation I shouldnt tell you about although we can say that it involves the non-LEGO world and evokes the magical transitions of classic childrens literature. (Obviously this movie is family-friendly but Im guessing the audience will skew pretty adult; my 9-year-olds would find it dizzyingly paced and only half-comprehensible.) But Lord and Millers ingenious LEGO simulacrum relies on the kind of naive epistemological certainty that the Wachowskis avoided in the ""Matrix"" trilogy where it was clear that breaking free of the Matrix was only a temporary liberation that raised uncomfortable and unanswerable questions about the Matrix-like nature of the real world and our own responsibility for its construction.In the world of ""The LEGO Movie"" everything really is awesome. If the LEGO universes version of Lord Business can be overthrown the real one continues to rule from on high unmolested and the movies critique of conformity becomes its opposite a benevolent reassurance that the dominant order can tolerate a bit of disorder at the micro-LEGO level. The genuine pleasure to be found in ""The LEGO Movie"" this tale of the liberatory force of pop culture as translated into plastic rectangles is as someone else once wrote about something else the heart of a heartless world the spirit of a spiritless world and ""the opium of the masses."" That as one robot said to another is my jam. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

"The Lego Movie reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up The Lego Movie A Clever Vivid Oddly Profound Movie ... About Plastic Bricks. The Lego Movie A Clever Vivid Oddly Profound Movie ... About Plastic Bricks. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Feb. 6 2014 723 PM The Lego Movie A clever vivid funny oddly profound movie ... about plastic bricks. By Dana Stevens Emmet Brickowski (voice of Chris Pratt) is a constuction worker with good friends in The Lego Movie. Still courtesy of Warner Bros. Picture The Lego Movie had so much going against it. First off its a movie inspired by a system of interlocking plastic blocks. Second its a branded entertainment--an ominous category if ever there was one all but guaranteeing a clamorous action infomercial shoddily intercut with a formulaic ""human"" story. Im going to level with you I went in hoping at best for something intermittently amusing not too visually and sonically assaultive and over soon. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. But Chris Miller and Philip Lord the creators of Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs and 21 Jump Street along with the highly regarded but short-lived animated series Clone High have gone and done it. Theyve made a clever vividly imagined consistently funny eye-poppingly pretty and oddly profound movie ... about Legos. Miller and Lord do not grovel before their corporate overlords and at times even appear to be conveying the subversive message that when it comes to Legos less may be more (or at least that a random bucket of unsorted blocks may be preferable to a brand-new boxed set). The Lego cosmos as envisioned in this story is divided between two sets of principles. On the one side theres order conformity and stasis as embodied by the perfection-obsessed freedom-stifling President Business (voice of Will Ferrell). On the other theres chaos individuality and change represented by the rebel movement thats attempting to find a mysterious lost object called the Piece of Resistance which will stop President Business before he can unleash the Kragle a weapon that threatens to freeze the dynamic Lego universe into a perfected but lifeless tableau. Precisely orchestrated silliness against the background of a kaleidoscopically colorful universe made up entirely of Lego pieces. Advertisement But the majority of the inhabitants of the eternally-in-construction city of Bricksburg live their lives blissfully unaware of this ideological divide Theyre interchangeable molded-plastic working stiffs square pegs in square holes. Squarest of all is Emmet Brickowski (voice of Chris Pratt) a go-along-to-get-along construction worker whos naively psyched to repeat the same dull day over and over again building the same brick towers while obediently bopping to the same state-mandated No. 1 pop song (Tegan and Saras irresistible ode to vacuity ""Everything Is Awesome"") and buying the same overpriced cups of takeout coffee. (A running gag about the ever-rising price of that commodity is one of the movies many jabs at consumer culture.) When Emmet accidentally comes into possession of a strange item that seems to come from outside the Lego universe resistance member Wyldstyle (a sort of Goth biker-chick minifig voiced by Elizabeth Banks) becomes convinced that the thoroughly unremarkable Emmet is the Special--a long-awaited figure of prophecy who will be ""the most important most interesting greatest person of all time."" Half against his will--though he is understandably bewitched by the tough and glamorous Wyldstyle--Emmet gets swept up in the rebels plan to disarm the Kragle and take down President Businesss reign of spontaneity-crushing terror. Joining Emmet and Wyldstyle on their mission are Vitruvius a glowing-eyed wizard figure voiced by Morgan Freeman whose dubious nuggets of wisdom and muttered expressions of annoyance are priceless sendups of the long Morgan Freeman-as-shaman voiceover tradition; the square-headed pink kitten Unikitty (voice of Alison Brie) whose bubbly optimism conceals a deep well of repressed rage; a blustering pirate figure (voice of Nick Offerman); and a chipper 80s-era spaceman slightly dinged from wear (voice of Charlie Day). When he can drag himself away from his Star Wars buddies theyre also joined by Wyldstyles boyfriend Batman (voice of Will Arnett) hilariously conceived as a post-Christopher-Nolan ""bad boy"" bent on impressing the world with his death-metal songwriting and brooding cool. But President Business--who as the minifigs journey takes them through a sprawling Lego multiverse Emmet never knew existed reveals himself as the even more diabolical Lord Business--has some fierce allies on his side including the fearsome Bad Cop/Good Cop (voice of Liam Neeson) who enacts both sides of the familiar law enforcement dichotomy simply by rotating his head to alternate between scowling and happy expressions. All this precisely orchestrated silliness unfolds against the background--or sometimes given the crisp-looking 3-D in the foreground--of a lovingly imagined insanely detailed and kaleidoscopically colorful universe made up entirely of Lego pieces. Nearly 4 million unique bricks were used in filming and though the stop-motion animation is liberally augmented with computer effects (to a degree that its impossible to tell where one technique leaves off and another begins) theres a chunky sense of real-world volume to the moving shapes and figures onscreen. Theres also a lot of Lego-based humor that you dont have to be a 10-year-old collector to appreciate--gags for example about the inefficiency of those C-shaped claw hands which can clutch only cylindrical foods like chicken legs or sausage links. The overall sensation (enhanced by Mark Mothersbaughs playful electronic score) is one of being whisked from one trippy Lego environment to the next--the trippiest of all being Unikittys homeland a conflict-free pastel Shangri-La known in what Im going to wager will be the only Aristophanes reference in a toy-based movie this year as ""Cloud-Cuckoo Land."" The last 20 minutes or so of The Lego Movie contain a big conceptual twist one that threatens at first to drag down the zippy kinetic energy of the films first hour. But stay with it because its in this perception-shifting last reel that the movie really sets itself apart not just from most branded entertainment but from most films for children period. As Lord and Miller skillfully balance an impressive array of narrative and thematic spinning plates--order and chaos adults and children practicality and magic the real and the imaginary--it becomes clear even if this anarchic celebration of the creative capacity of play centers around the struggles of one-and-a-half-inch-tall minifigures its built on a distinctly human scale.

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT In a conformist Lego world one small figure fights for unfettered creativity. Rated PG (action some Lego violence) BOTTOM LINE One of the best kids movies in years with dazzling animation and a sparkling voice cast. Its more fun than you can shake a brick at. CAST Chris Pratt Will Ferrell Morgan Freeman Elizabeth Banks LENGTH 140 To create and preserve or to destroy and rebuild? As a child you probably struggled with these profound impulses while messing around with Legos. That tension lies at the heart of ""The Lego Movie"" which doesnt at all feel like the extended toy commercial you might be fearing. Instead its the smartest funniest and most dazzlingly inventive childrens movie to come along in years. Computer-animated in a stop-motion style -- with more than 15 million individual ""bricks"" -- ""The Lego Movie"" unfolds in a bright multicolored world of those familiar dotted blocks and little yellow figures with U-shaped hands. Among them is Emmet (voice of Chris Pratt) a happily conformist construction worker who uncovers a dark plot The tyrant Lord Business (Will Ferrell) plans to glue the entire Lego universe together and only the Piece of Resistance can stop him. If Emmett wants to fight for unfettered creativity he must throw away his instruction booklets and become a visionary Master Builder. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Directed by Chris Lord and Phil Miller (""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs"") who also helped write the screenplay ""The Lego Movie"" shines on almost every level. The details are enchanting Legos are used to create everything including water smoke and explosions; its a brilliant collaboration between the virtual animation studio Animal Logic (""Happy Feet"") and the Claymation craftsman Chris McKay (""Robot Chicken""). The characters sparkle too particularly the puppyish Emmet and his punky love interest Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks). ""The Lego Movie"" also allows two legendary voices to get silly Morgan Freeman as the nonchalant guru Vitruvius and Liam Neeson pulling triple duty as the two-faced Good Cop/Bad Cop (and his dad Pa Cop) are having an audibly excellent time. Will Arnett plays Batman as an insufferable Goth-rock poseur. If anything ""The Lego Movie"" is the rare childrens movie that suffers from overambition. Its crammed a little too full of ideas meta humor and conflicting narrative themes. Theres also a death scene that while played partly for laughs may startle young viewers. All of that however still adds up to just a quibble. ""The Lego Movie"" is as much fun as well 15 million Legos.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 922 a.m. EST February 7 2014The all-Lego adventure is warm and witty showing flashes of satire.Lego minfigures Wyldstyle (voiced by Elizabeth Banks) and Emmet (Chris Pratt) in the animated motion picture ""The Lego Movie.?""(Photo Warner Bros. Pictures)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY review    out of fourVoices Chris Pratt Elizabeth Banks Morgan Freeman Will Ferrell Will ArnettRated PG; runtime 1 hour 41 minutes; opens Friday nationwideThe Lego Movie (   out of four; rated PG; opens Friday nationwide) is a spirited romp through a world that looks distinctively familiar and yet freshly inventive.As classic toy fixtures for more than 70 years the colorful plastic interlocking Lego bricks are instantly recognizable. And the computer-generated world created by writer-directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs) is one that makes use of these readily identifiable parts in appealing buoyant and often surprising ways. Using a detailed tactile style of computer animation that also resembles stop-motion the films look suits the aesthetics of Lego constructions.The joy in a bucket of toy bricks lies in the panoply of possible shapes and structures and the filmmakers palpably convey that sense of imaginative creation.STORY The Lego Movie Building a toy story from bricksINTERVIEW Chris Pratts movie stardom snaps together with LegoMORE Lego filmmakers No guns some peril some assurancesREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersIts an eye-catching environment though at times the whole thing becomes a bit too noisy and frenetic. But overall the experience is giddy fun for the kids and the irreverent dialogue and gently pointed satire is amusing for the adults who accompany them.This action-packed story is the first feature-length movie composed entirely of real and computer-generated Legos. This all-Legos-all-the-time universe is especially striking in the way it depicts smoke and storm-tossed seas. Who knew those little building blocks could simulate undulating waves?At the center of the family-friendly fun is Lego mini-figure Emmet Brickowoski voiced by Chris Pratt. As unremarkable as they come he unquestioningly follows orders at his humdrum construction job enjoys the inane TV show hes fed daily and sings along to the obnoxious but catchy song on the radio. Though Emmet appears to be a blank slate underneath his bland exterior is a sweet yearning. He consults a manual for pointers on how to win friends to little avail.Everything changes when Emmet inadvertently stumbles on a strange object and meets the rebellious Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks). He learns he might be ""the Special"" in accordance with an ancient prophecy that says he will save the world from impending doom.Emmet is trying to foil a plan for world domination set in motion by President Business and enforced by his swivel-headed schizoid enforcer Bad Cop/Good Cop (Liam Neeson) and legions of robot clones.Household items such as Q-tips Krazy Glue and nail polish remover are regarded as relics from another civilization and play key parts in the zany but unevenly paced tale which has whiffs of Toy Story Wreck-it Ralph and even The Matrix.Those who have played with the small Danish brick-like toys -- or the more recent video games -- will no doubt get a particular kick out of this ingenious movie.Even for those who arent Lego fans the spry adventure saga offers plenty of laughs and clever allusions as well as a sometimes-subversive skewering of modern conformity.A warmhearted goofy celebration of creativity The Lego Movie builds on a sweet tale of finding ones inner imaginative child. 296 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 7 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1buJHi4",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/02/06/lego-review/4983673/,200,thelegomovie16,thelegomovie,usatoday
"The Lego Movie is a little uncanny and a lot creative review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Lego Movie is a little uncanny and a lot creative reviewThe very existence of The LEGO Movie is a tribute to the creative spirit it so entertainingly celebrates.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Feb. 6 2014 The LEGO Movie 3 stars Animated comedy voiced by Chris Pratt Elizabeth Banks Morgan Freeman Will Ferrell Liam Neeson and Will Arnett. Directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller. At GTA theatres. 101 minutes. G Most adults past the age of puberty would have doubted the feature movie potential of LEGO especially if they were tripping over tiny plastic bricks strewn about the house by their offspring. Enter writers/directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller who enjoy proving skeptics wrong. They made fresh film comedy out of the defunct TV drama series 21 Jump Street  and wowed both kids and adults with the wacky weather animations of Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs . Article Continued Below Now they breathe vivid life into plastic with The LEGO Movie  an entertaining and frenetic ode to the spirit of creativity. They co-wrote it with Hotel Transylvania s Dan and Kevin Hageman and created it using CGI that mimics homemade stop-motion animation. In so doing they neatly prove the truth of what animators call ""the uncanny valley"" thesis that humans are more willing to accept a crudely drawn figure than they are a nearly perfect animated one. Our minds rebel at creations that creepily seem human yet somehow arent. Theres no chance of anyone mistaking LEGO s imperfect protagonist Emmet for human or even possessing a brain. Voiced by Chris Pratt (TVs Parks and Recreation ) hes a thick-as-a-brick construction worker with yellow ""skin"" and a painted-on smile who is plucked from conformist obscurity and called to heroism. Hes believed to be ""the Special"" the saviour of not only his ordered town of Bricksburg but also the whole darned universe. So goes the prologue prophecy intoned by the wizardly Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) who says only the Special can stop the machinations of evil Lord Business (Will Ferrell) a maniacal control freak whose power is exceeded only by the mysterious ""Man Upstairs."" In his capitalist guise of President Business the (supposedly) benign ruler of Bricksburg Lord Business promises his loyal citizens ""Taco Tuesdays"" and other dumb treats as long as they always follow his instructions -- and woe betide those who dont. Adventure is the last thing on the dim mind of Emmet who is mellow about being yellow and loves everybody and everything. He sings along to an insanely catchy pop ditty called ""Everything Is Awesome"" (perfect for torturing despots) cheerfully pays 37 for a cup of factory coffee and enjoys a reality TV show called ""Where Are My Pants?"" Then he falls in with a free spirit named Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) a hellcat with multi-hued hair and erratic mood swings who is part of an anti-authority resistance movement called the Master Builders. Theyre out to mess up the orderly plans of President Business and Emmet is going to help them do it even if it kiboshes his happy conformity. The LEGO Movie makers must have enjoyed some festive pharmaceuticals as they crafted this increasingly loco story which also includes the two-faced Bad Cop/Good Cop (Liam Neeson) a smug and arrogant Batman (Will Arnett) and characters from the Star Wars  Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings franchises who just pop up for the hell of it. It feels sometimes as if the movie is just slamming stuff together to see what will come of it especially when it starts to near the two-hour mark of non-stop frantic activity. And speaking of uncanny valleys theres something weird about a film that simultaneously plays like a feature-length commercial for LEGO while at the same time mocking consumer culture. Such inconsistency is precisely the point of it all dude . Nothing is more detrimental to creativity than mindlessly following the rule book. For the most part its a hoot. Theres more ingenuity packed into one minute of this film than there is in the entire running time of most animated amusements. Im not sure the LEGO movie novelty will survive the inevitable sequels and relentless toy marketing. But you cant help but applaud a film one aimed primarily at children where the most dangerous weapon is a squished tube of glue and the scariest threat is a lack of imagination.

In The Lego Movie ordinary-guy Emmet (Chris Pratt) is expected to save the world with the help of a rebellious crew that includes Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) and Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman). Warner Bros. The Lego Movie Directors Phil Lord Christopher Miller Genre Animation action comedy Running time 100 minutes Rated PG With Will Arnett Elizabeth Banks Craig Berry (Recommended) If youd told 10-year-old me there was going to be a movie all about Legos and the world they inhabit Id have been in line at the theater right then. Oh its not out until 2014? Okay let me just build a time machine out of Legos and travel to the future. But adult me hardened by years of non-Lego life experience -- insipid toy-to-movie adaptations like Battleship for instance plus a sore lack of a regular free-form building sessions -- had his guard up. Wasnt necessary The Lego Movie may be one giant advertisement but all the way to its plastic-mat foundation its an earnest piece of work -- a cash grab with a heart. Made for with and about Legos the movie is also made for with and about imagination and when that association seems completely natural its a win all around. The movie chooses as its hero the unimaginative but boundlessly positive Emmet (voiced by Chris Pratt) whos just another average Lego guy living in the big Lego city going about his regular Lego day. As with most things Lego theres an instruction manual for everything and Emmet eats watches and says exactly what hes supposed to. The instructions say thats how you fit in make friends lead a happy life -- only somehow that hasnt worked out for Emmet who doesnt really have friends yet. (Theres an unsubtle critique of mainstream conformity going on here exemplified by the transparently dumb yet incredibly catchy Lego pop hit ""Everything is AWESOME"" which wont be leaving your head for days after you hear it.) YouTube Theres an evil mastermind bent on destroying the world a prophecy about a chosen one and a spirited adventure to get to but lets talk for a second about how this movie moves When Emmet showers the water and soap suds are Lego pieces. When circumstances lead Emmet out of the city and across Lego deserts forests and oceans the land sea and lava are all solid Legos. Animated in 3-D but made to look like its a stop-motion joint the movie takes pleasure in translating how we move to a Lego-based reality and revels in the goofiness of a world operating under Lego-specific laws of physics. When you ride a horse its legs stay frozen even at a gallop; your head can swivel 180 degrees; and Krazy Glue spells immobilizing doom. Writer-directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller of Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs charged both with balancing the needs of a brand and telling a lighthearted story never miss an opportunity to get silly with how Legos work When Emmet catches a mysterious woman named Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) poking around the construction site where he works for instance the slow-motion hair flip youve seen in a thousand Hollywood romances is a clip-on hair piece swiveling back and forth on her yellow Lego head. The self-conscious irreverent tone holds steady as the stakes increase. When Emmet finds a strange red piece that sticks itself to his back Wyldstyle identifies him as The Special -- the smartest most talented most interesting most superlative-in-everything person whos destined to save the Lego world from the order-obsessed Lord Business (Will Ferrell). Of course Emmet goes along with the idea with Pratt lending him a can-do enthusiasm thats infectious to everyone but the movies other characters -- especially once Wyldstyle along with sage Lego wizard Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) and a brooding self-absorbed Lego Batman (Will Arnett) discover that hes not special at all. That doesnt stop Emmet from being pursued by Bad Cop (Liam Neeson) on orders from Business across the diverse Lego world. (If theres a Lego set for it they go there.) Neeson also voices Good Cop -- the split personality living on the back side of Bad Cops head -- and its a rare delight to hear Neeson depart from the growl for cheery words of encouragement. Energetically plotted and lousy with jokes The Lego Movie succeeds as much more than a marketing ploy not least because it understands what makes Legos so appealing and embraces the anarchic way kids actually play with them The instructions are there but often the most fun you can have is when you break the rules and assemble something weird and new that only you could create -- whether its a spaceship built from mountains and alligators or a double-decker couch. Emphasizing that idea too bluntly in a sharp swerve near the movies end almost sends our heroes jumping the Lego shark but its hard to fault the filmmakers for getting a little saccharine; theyre sincere about celebrating imagination and play. Theyve delivered a story that could have been spun from the head of a kid sitting down to play with his Legos -- and for adults ready to dust off their childhood sets theyve captured that feeling of creative possibility remarkably well.

An unlikely World War II platoon is tasked to rescue art masterpieces from Nazi thieves. Starring George Clooney Matt Damon John Goodman and Bill Murray. (Photo/Video Columbia Pictures) By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Feb. 6 2014 208 p.m. ET Though the Third Reich is crumbling World War II still rages around the improbable heroes of ""The Monuments Men"" a platoon of art experts sent into Germany by FDR to rescue priceless treasures of Western art before the Nazis can destroy them. The story based on fact is a fascinating one but the conflict here isnt confined to the battlefield. The movies tone is at war with its subject and sometimes with its wavering self. Masterworks of marble and canvas compete with cardboard characters in a jaunty action adventure that stops every now and then for an art-appreciation lecture on the importance of it all. Instead of the Dirty Dozen theres a sophisticated seven played by George Clooney (he directed from a screenplay he wrote with Grant Heslov) Matt Damon Bill Murray John Goodman Jean Dujardin Bob Balaban and Hugh Bonneville. This ragtag military unit comprises museum directors curators and art historians whove gone through a jokey version of basic training before taking up sidearms and rifles and tracking down Michelangelos ""Bruges Madonna"" and the ""Ghent Altarpiece"" among other vanished objets. What a cast but also what a waste since the action part proves to be as synthetic as the art part. The only actor whos found a consistently dramatic tone is Cate Blanchett in a small but crucial role as a Parisian working at the Jeu de Paume museum next door to the Louvre. She uses a fake French accent that is beautifully and authentically fake in the tradition of Hollywood war films ""The Monuments Men"" seeks to emulate. ENLARGE Cate Blanchett listens in to a conversation from her desk in The Monuments Men. Columbia Pictures War films that is with tightly focused missions like ""The Guns of Navarone"" or ""The Heroes of Telemark."" But they took themselves quite earnestly and were received in the same spirit; no need for repeated lectures on the importance of destroying a huge German gun emplacement or the crucial component of a German atom bomb. ""The Monuments Men"" which was based on a lively but essentially serious book written by Robert M. Edsel with Bret Witter represents a fundamental mismatch between style and substance. The movie sends its citizen-soldiers off on their deeply serious mission with mock-martial music and snare drums then follows them through pseudo-perilous situations that feel labored (capturing a very young German sniper) or simply recycled (one of the men discovering that hes standing on a land mine). Alexandre Desplats intrusive score keeps telling us what mood we should be in. Moods change from moment to moment though and not only in the action sequences. Mr. Clooneys Frank Stokes the leader of the group is certainly a serious guy when it comes to appreciating the place of art in civilization but some of his subalterns have been written as caricatures of intellectuals let alone the distinguished scholars they were in real life. One of the running jokes--dumb jokes--concerns the hopelessly inept French spoken by Mr. Damons James Granger whos supposed to be the Metropolitan Museums curator of medieval art. A pre-eminent art historian who comes off like a country bumpkin? The script cooks up an equally dumb conflict between the Monuments Men and Ms. Blanchetts Claire Simone a fictional version of the remarkable real-life heroine Rose Valland. As the movie has it Claire mistrusts the Yanks. Instead of rejoicing in their arrival she ventures the patently absurd opinion that theyve come to find Europes missing art treasures in order to spirit them back to America. A little respect for real-world logic would not have weighed the movie down. Watch a clip from ""The Lego Movie."" An ordinary LEGO minifigure (Chris Pratt) is mistakenly recruited to join a quest to stop an evil LEGO tyrant (Will Ferrell) from gluing the universe together. Also starring Liam Neeson. (Photo/Video Warner Bros.) The Lego Movie I never thought Id be dispensing praise by calling a movie a hodgepodge but then I never thought Id be praising a movie based on Lego toys; films generated by popular toy lines are often pretty awful. ""The Lego Movie"" an animated feature in 3-D was written and directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller who first made their mark on the big screen with ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs."" Its visual aesthetic simulates Lego construction--a riot of unruly modules--and its overall look is delightfully new. But the best part is what the movie has to say about conformity--following the instructions on the box--versus creativity i.e. life as a jumble an inspired improvisation a joyous hodgepodge. ENLARGE From left to right Wyldstyle (voiced by Elizabeth Banks) Batman (Will Arnett) and Emmet (Chris Pratt). Warner Bros. Pictures The hero Emmet is a little Lego figure living in a colorful Lego world of perfect happiness where he like everyone else follows elaborate instructions for snapping together his daily routine. The opening sequences set in this plastic utopia are themselves a whirlwind of creativity--everyone is happy and everything is awesome especially when youre part of a team. But Emmets life takes a sudden turn into existential confusion when a tough and sexy Lego minifigure named Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) mistakes him for The Special--think Neo in ""The Matrix""--the figure fated to save the world. ""The Lego Movie"" moves fast--sometimes exhaustingly so--demands close attention and rewards it with a quick-witted script and a cast of inventive characters that includes President Business (voiced by Will Ferrell) a villainous CEO who basically runs the world; his swivel-headed henchman Bad Cop/Good Cop (Liam Neeson); an ancient prophet Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman); and thanks to the wonders of Lego licensing Wyldstyles boyfriend Batman (Will Arnett). ENLARGE President Business voiced by Will Ferrell Warner Bros. Pictures Unlike the pell-mell pace the brilliance of those early sequences isnt sustained and a climactic device is plainly and simply a bad idea. Whats more the scripts satiric edge is blunted by unctuous banalities about being special--Emmet may not be The Special but he is told he is special in the sense that everyone is special. Yet ""The Lego Movie"" has a specialness all its own. Theres never been a hodgepodge quite like it. Watch a clip from the film ""In Bloom."" Set in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi in 1992 Eka and Natia look to leave childhood behind as they ignore societal customs and work to escape their turbulent family lives. (Photo/Video Big World Pictures) In Bloom The original title of Georgias foreign-language Oscar submission translates to ""Long Bright Days"" but the new title ""In Bloom"" has a nicely ironic if accidental ambiguity. What exactly is in bloom--young love and hope or the domestic and political violence surrounding the lives of two teenage girls at the center of this modest but affecting debut feature? (The film was directed by Nana Ekvtimishvili and Simon Gross from Ms. Ekvtimishvilis screenplay.) Eka and Natia played respectively and impressively by Lika Babluani and Mariam Bokeria are friends and neighbors in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi in 1992. It has been only a year since Georgia declared its independence from the Soviet Union and this is not to say the least a happy country. Some of the anger is situational--long breadlines electricity outages sullen cops and soldiers--but much of the darkness in the culture is universal macho boys with knives and attitude aggressive men who treat their women like chattels. In one of many chilling scenes drunken louts at a wedding toast the beauty of their women who are studies in resignation. Of the two friends Natia is strikingly attractive and woefully vulnerable while Eka with her mournful eyes and soulful demeanor is better able to take the measure of the grim life that threatens to engulf her. In the films most stirring scene Eka dances a ritual dance that seems to signal her entry into the adult world. This adroit and understated coming-of-age film reminded me of the New Wave of Czech films in the 1960s but with a distinctive poignancy that translates to wisdom. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download ENLARGE The Train (1964) French art treasures being shipped to Nazi Germany in an action thriller that knows its mission is to thrill. Paul Scofield is Von Waldheim the German colonel who has organized the shipment. Burt Lancaster is Labiche the French Resistance leader who (after interesting misgivings) sets out to stop him. The train and the railroad trappings become visual stars but even they in their steamy immensity cant compete with Lancaster a force of nature who did his own spectacular stunts. John Frankenheimer directed a cast that includes Jeanne Moreau Albert Remy and the great Michel Simon. ENLARGE Toy Story 2 (1999) The toys arent made of Lego bricks and they live their secret lives at a slower pace but their saga still stands as one of the two best sequels in movie history. (Toys didnt figure in the other one ""The Godfather Part II."") If youve seen it many times as I have and think theres nothing new to discover about it go to YouTube and search for ""How Toy Story 2 Almost Got Deleted."" Had it not been for a preposterously lucky fluke the film might never have made it to the screen. ENLARGE Since Otar Left (2003) The setting is Tbilisi the capital of Georgia and one of the protagonists is named Eka but this Eka far from being young and beautiful is a quick-witted matriarch played by 90-year-old Esther Gorintin. A Francophile who speaks French with a Provencal accent Eka dreams her own dreams of traveling to Paris to see her son Otar. When word comes that he has died in an accident Ekas daughter and granddaughter conceal the news from her in the belief that it would be more than she could bear. They are to put it mildly mistaken.

Movies based on toys and games are inherently commercial -- and usually bad. ""The Lego Movie"" might have fallen into that same bottomless pit of profiteering but a pair of guardian angels have lifted it into the top tier of recent animated movies.Writer/directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller made ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" and ""21 Jump Street"" so theyve got a proven track record of spoofing consumerism and the round-peg parameters of Lego bricks have ironically freed the duo to make their loopiest movie yet. Along with a zippy script that will tickle kids and grown-ups alike this overflowing box of goodies includes cool gadgets colorful scenery and a stellar cast of voice actors.Morgan Freeman sets a tone of self-mockery as an ageless prophet who foretells the arrival of a hero who will free Brickburg from the tyrannical President Business (Will Ferrell). That hero turns out to be a construction worker named Emmet Brickowski (Chris Pratt puppy-dog lovable). Like everyone else in the city Emmet cheers for the local sports team guffaws at the sitcom ""Where Are My Pants?"" and bobs his head to an infectious ditty called ""Everything Is Awesome."" Yet this ordinary guy stumbles upon a magical artifact -- ""the piece of resistance"" -- that can stop President Business from cementing his power on Taco Tuesday.With the piece in his possession Emmet is befriended by Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) an action babe who had thought she was the prophesied hero. She helps Emmet make a high-speed escape from a local lawman (Liam Neeson) whose spin-around head has Good Cop and Bad Cop sides. Their adventure takes them into other Lego realms including the Old West the candy-colored Cloud Cuckoo Land and the Star Wars universe. Pop culture references fly fast and furious as Emmet and Wyldstyle acquire comrades who include the annoyingly upbeat Unikitty (Alison Brie) and the sullen selfish Batman (Will Arnett). The movie loses some of its satirical edge in an overlong live-action finale about the virtues of nonconformity. But the block-lettered message is a small price to pay for the preceding joyride. ""The Lego Movie"" is a marvelous piece of work.What ""The Lego Movie""  Three and a half stars out of four  Rating PG  Run time 140  Content Mild action and rude humor Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

This is the one. This is the film that our entire shared experience of pop culture has been building towards."" I think it was around the time we saw a council of heroes (called ""Master Builders"") made up of among others Gandalf Wonder Woman Milhouse from The Simpsons Michelangelo the Statue of Liberty and the 2001 NBA All-Stars. Or maybe it was when a LEGO Batman played us his own death-metal composition (""Darkness ...No parents ..."") and everybody nodded along to the songs edginess. The LEGO Movie is the kind of animated free-for-all that comes around very rarely if ever A kids movie that matches shameless fun with razor-sharp wit that offers up a spectacle of pure freewheeling joy even as it tackles the thorniest of issues. Its part South Park part Lord of the Rings; part The Matrix part Idiocracy. Its a superhero team-up movie a toy-strewn dystopian vision and a Bergman-esque inquiry into the mind of God. And its somehow still also fall-off-your-seat funny. The films irreverence is partly just a physical fact It takes place in a world made up almost entirely of LEGOs. The characters eat LEGO drumsticks they shower with LEGO water their guns shoot LEGO lasers and their ships roll on LEGO waves. In that context its hard not to think of everything as parody. But writer-directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (who also gave us Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs and 21 Jump Street) have also designed the story to comment on its own LEGO-ness. Our hero is mild-mannered smiley-faced construction-worker Emmet (voiced by Chris Pratt) a totally anonymous worker drone who happens upon a rare non-LEGO object called ""The Piece of Resistance."" An ancient (and as evidenced by the opening scene totally made up) prophecy declares that the person who finds this object will be The Special ""the most important most interesting greatest person of all time."" Emmet is clearly not said person. But before he knows it hes whisked along by Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) a beautiful Trinity-like member of a resistance movement determined to end the rule of President Business (Will Ferrell). Formerly Lord Business this seemingly fun-loving leader of LEGO Land is in reality a despot who cant bear to see anything out of place. Hes protected by Good Cop/Bad Cop (Liam Neeson) a seemingly indestructible two-faced policeman as well as an army of giant tentacled ""micro managers"" who enforce his deadly vision of making sure nothing ever changes - that nothing ever gets built that wasnt pre-determined and packaged with specific instructions. What can be particularly tiresome about movies based on established toys (as opposed to movies that merely launch toys) is an overwhelming sense of brand management. You know a bunch of people up and down the corporate chain at the toy company approved and oversaw what is supposed to be even in its most debased form an artistic vision. (Every time the Hasbro logo comes on at the beginning of a G.I. Joe or Transformers movie I die a little.) The LEGO Movie turns that whole concept on its ear. Much of the humor in the film as well as some of its social commentary comes from the toys very limitations - from that hilariously regimented anonymity that these toys can sometimes have. Everybody in the film listens to the same radio station - ""Rock FM."" Everybody buys overpriced coffee at the same place. Its a very LEGO wasteland. Seriously either LEGO executives were asleep at the wheel or theyre the coolest executives ever. At any rate theyve done all of us a service and I suspect their product is about to become bigger than ever. That Lord and Millers skewering manages to be so cutting without being mean-spirited feels like a kind of magic act. But none of that quite prepared me for some third-act plot developments that sent the film spinning in new surprisingly profound directions. For what starts off as a lighthearted ten-gags-a-second send-up eventually begins to ask some poignant questions What is the nature of creation? And is God a vengeful hard-ass who asks that everything always remain the same or a benevolent dictator who wants his creations to realize their full potential? Yes Im reading too much into it but its all in the spirit of the film. This is a movie that takes LEGOs true ethos to heart. Take the blocks and build something new. Find your own meaning.

(Courtesy of Warner Bros. Picture) By Michael OSullivan February 6 2014 There are so many things to like about ""The Lego Movie"" a great voice cast clever dialogue and a handsome blend of stop-motion and CGI animation that feels lovingly retro while still looking sharp in 21st-century 3-D. But the best thing about this movie which was produced in full partnership with the Danish toymaker famous for its plastic-brick building system is its subversive nature. While clearly filled with affection for -- and marketing tie-ins to -- the titular product thats front and center its also something of a sharp plastic brick flung in the eye of its corporate sponsor. Once celebrated for fostering creativity through simple yet versatile sets that could be combined into a wide variety of structures -- a barn a boat a plane -- the 80-year old Lego company is probably best known today as a purveyor of narrowly proscribed model kits with hundreds of highly specialized pieces designed to replicate in meticulous detail say the A-wing starfighter from ""Star Wars"" and nothing else. The most essential item of the modern Lego set has become unfortunately the instruction booklet. Thankfully and somewhat surprisingly ""The Lego Movie"" takes dead aim at this disturbing trend undermining with delightful results the hegemony of a creative toy that comes with its own set of inflexible rules. ""The Lego Movie"" is an homage to the spirit of the iconoclast (i.e. the child). Its hero ironically is anything but a rule-breaker. Set in a world built entirely of Legos the story revolves around construction worker Emmet Brickowski (voice of Chris Pratt) a tiny plastic Everyman who loves nothing better than following instructions. But when his Lego universe is threatened by an evil villain (Will Ferrell) who intends to glue all the worlds pieces -- and its people -- together Emmet must join forces with a group of rebels to stop him. (In a nod to the term Lego uses to designate its in-house designers these creative free spirits are known as ""master builders."") Guided by a leader whos part Gandalf and part Morpheus (Morgan Freeman) this underground resistance movement consists of a fittingly motley crew a punk-ish loner named Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks); her egotistical boyfriend Batman (Will Arnett); a well-worn Lego spaceman figure from the mid-1980s (Charlie Day); and a robot-pirate hybrid named Metal Beard (Nick Offerman). The rest of the freedom fighters are a cheeky mix of Lego-sized historical personages (Abraham Lincoln Shakespeare and Shaquille ONeal) and co-branded comic book heroes (Green Lantern Superman Wonder Woman and others). Keep an ear out for cameos by such stars as Jonah Hill Channing Tatum and Billy Dee Williams good-naturedly reprising his role as Lando Calrissian from the ""Star Wars"" trilogy. Its hard not to have fun when the film (written and directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller) is having such a good time with pop culture. The chief party animal of course is Ferrell. Overplaying his character Lord Business like a distant cousin of his dim-witted ""Megamind"" villain the actor once again gets tons of comic mileage out of his patented silly grandiloquence. (""Nail polish remover"" -- a deadly weapon if youre a plastic toy and your face has been painted on -- becomes in Ferrells threatening delivery the ""poe-leash remover of nah-eel."") ""The Lego Movie"" pokes fun at anyone who would argue that Lego products are as one character puts it ""a highly sophisticated interlocking brick system"" and not simply toys. But it also makes fun of itself tweaking the conventions of narrative filmmaking animation and Lego model-making itself. Its a constant pleasure to discover how the animators have figured out how to render such un-bricklike substances as water soap bubbles the steam from a locomotive or flames. The moral of this story is a sweet and uncomplicated one Believe in yourself; everyone is special; theres a time to follow the rules and a time to break them. Sure those sentiments are cloying. In fact they sound like something youd see on one of those stupid inspirational cat posters dont they? As it turns out thats exactly how a character in this adorably acerbic little movie describes them.    1/2 PG. At area theaters. Contains mild action and some rude nose-thumbing humor. 94 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Colin Covert colincovert Warning Choking hazard -- laughter. ""The Lego Movie"" is the best toy story since the last ""Toy Story."" Theres slam-bang silliness to keep the households junior members entertained with sharp blockbuster parody and sly social satire for the rest. The creative forces behind this nifty surprise are writing/directing partners Phil Lord and Chris Miller. They worked similar wonders with the plotless childrens book ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs"" and made an idiots delight of ""21 Jump Street."" Here theyve assembled an endearingly quirky charmer to make you clap your tiny curved yellow hands in joy. In Bricksburg industrious workers demolish artistic Old World buildings to make way for sterile horizon-choking office towers. Its all part of the master plan imposed by President Business (voiced by Will Ferrell) uptight CEO of this lockstep domain. His Octan Corp. creates mind-dulling pop music insipid TV shows surveillance systems history books voting machines and flying robot Micro-Managers. His rule An orderly Bricksburg is a happy Bricksburg. Bricksburgs uniform citizens agree commuting to work on a motorway that looks like the New Jersey Turnpike in pastels. Perhaps the most ordinary among them is Emmet (Chris Pratt) a nice-guy nerd elated by his daily routine of overpriced coffee-chain java work sports bar chicken wings and the TV sitcom ""Where Are My Pants?"" In fact Emmet fits in so well that none of his co-workers remembers a single detail about him. All that changes when Emmet tumbles down a hole (endlessly uproariously) and discovers a non-Lego artifact. As foretold by the shaman Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) Emmet becomes the most powerful important and interesting person in the world. He even meets the girl of his dreams Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) who represents the imaginative make-your-own-instructions Master Builders. Warner Bros. Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) and Unikitty (Alison Brie) in ""The Lego Movie."" As the prophesied leader of this revolutionary clique Emmet visits other Lego realms and joins forces with Batman (Will Arnett) 80s Spaceman Benny (Charlie Day) and Metalbeard the Pirate (Nick Offerman) to save the day. In epic action movie mode many bullets fly many cars crash and a bucketload of things blow up. All in Lego-mation of course. Though the film was made with computer graphics it artfully mimics the 3-D look and feel of stop-motion animation. The movements are a bit clockwork and herky-jerky retaining the sense of the theatrical machinery of a young kids mind. Even the pandemonium has a comic shape. Theres something irresistibly silly about all that ricocheting building-block debris. This is joyous moviemaking. Freeman skewers his long run of oracular wise man roles with his turn as a glib bogus soothsayer. There are jabs against Siri ""The Lord of the Rings"" failed Lego brands Liam Neesons late-career makeover as a bad-ass and the DC Universes biggest loser Green Lantern. Theres a swell nod to the Greek playwright Aristophanes the father of theatrical comedy and a pleasantly sentimental moral about doing things right vs. doing the right things. Comedy can be difficult. Here it just snaps together.

Grade B+ Even when the wit in this cartoon mini-epic is scattershot it knocks you silly because the directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller launch it from a circus super-cannon. For two-thirds of the way through their inventiveness keeps pace with a madcap plot - they concoct wild comic fantasias out of little Lego bricks. The film is full of walking sight gags like Good Cop/Bad Cop (Liam Neeson) - a policeman with a smiling face and a grimace on either side of his rotating head. Until the moviemakers succumb to gooey messages and mixed-up feelings their gleefully impure audiovisual slapstick makes ""The Lego Movie"" a blast. As they set up a cracked satiric parable about conformity Lord and Miller erase any fears that a universe and cast built of tiny multicolored blocks will be predictable or monotonous. With a whooshing camera and a palette as vivid as a vintage Colorforms set they introduce us to the vile Lord Business (Will Ferrell) who wants to use a mighty weapon called the Kragle against the citizens of the world. The Master Builder and righteous seer Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) warns Lord Business that a Special One will find the device that can thwart the Kragle - the ""Piece of Resistance."" (This movie had me at ""Piece of Resistance."") Master Builders like Vitruvius disdain regulations and create whatever they want out of any random scraps of Lego. Lord Business wants to freeze everything and everyone into a fixed place. The joke at the center of the movie is that the Special One destined to bring LB down appears to be a super-ordinary Lego mini-figure named Emmet (Chris Pratt). He lives by the book - an all-inclusive instruction manual that teaches him to treasure routines. Even in his hometown of Bricksburg where everyone watches the same TV sitcom (""Wheres My Pants"") and sings the same hit tune (""Everything Is Awesome"") Emmet is nondescript. Hes so intent on following rules and blending in that nobody notices him. Nobody that is except a fierce funky Master Builder named Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) who grudgingly proclaims him the Special One when he finds a mysterious red rectangular object - the Piece of Resistance. She wins his heart and wrests him away from Bricksburg to meet Vitruvius and multitudes of other Master Builders including Lincoln Shakespeare and Wonder Woman. So many wonderful bits swirl through every corner of this film its a minor miracle that Emmets story provides the farce with a center of gravity. What makes his tale so funny for so long is that Lord and Miller (who also wrote the script) rib him mercilessly as a little man whos smaller than life. He passively accepts all conventional wisdom. He thinks President Business - the political and corporate persona of Lord Business - must be a good guy partly because he owns a mega-company that puts out many ""awesome"" things from gas stations music and dairy products to surveillance systems history books and voting machines. Emmet is shocked to learn that this blemish-free leader plans to end the world in three days. The Special One is supposed to be a Master Builder but the only invention Emmet can think of is a double-decker couch that would enable all his friends to watch TV in his tiny apartment. What keeps the film from being cruel is that the moviemakers find ingenious ways to make Emmets clumsy vacuity an advantage. He achieves waking visions easily because unlike real mystics he doesnt have to work hard to empty his mind. And when Emmet and his friends flee from Lord Business at sea they stay afloat and go unnoticed on his double-decker couch. As a pirate Master Builder explains its one of those ideas ""so dumb and bad that no one would ever think they could possibly be useful."" The film keeps building up a head of steam as it gathers the key good guys and gals including buccaneer Metal Beard (Nick Offerman); a 1980s spaceman (Charlie Day); Unikitty (Alison Brie) a cross between a unicorn and a kitten; and Wyldstyles boyfriend Batman (Will Arnett) who works only in black or very very dark gray. Even the supporting Master Builders supply humorous shticks like a Green Lantern (Jonah Hill) who clings to Superman (Channing Tatum) though Supes cant stand the sight of him. This films multiple fantasy realms like the medieval ""Middle Zealand"" are packed with pop-culture references - they make you feel as if youre inside Robin Williams head. Youre taken aback when a film that thrives on runaway innovation starts to hype the virtue of Emmets ""team player"" mentality. Its as if the filmmakers suddenly become over-protective teachers (or very savvy marketers). They give an equal amount of gold stars to mediocrities and geniuses. The real Master Builders turn out to be prima donnas who cant control their own creativity - it takes Emmet to whip them into shape so they can follow a group game plan. This isnt a coherent vision Its a lesson plan designed to make everybody happy and everybody equal. Even worse the movie takes a surprise turn that leads to a bog of additional positive were-all-special messages and family-film cuteness and sentimentality. As a result ""The Lego Movie"" leaves you feeling stuffed instead of sated. Still much of the time it makes other movies based on toys look like childs play.

"Review The Lego Movie is a tall stack of subversive fun - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review The Lego Movie is a tall stack of subversive fun Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic ""The Lego Movie"" is a massive collision of subversive humor hyper-kinetic energy mind-jangling design spinning colors and about 15 million Legos no exaggeration.It is very tempting to use the movies pounding pop anthem -- ""Everything Is Awesome"" -- to put this insane sensory experience into sound-bite perspective. But that is no doubt the piece de resistance of the filmmakers master plan. Or in ""Lego Movie"" speak the Piece of Resistance. So in solidarity with that sentiment Ill resist.PHOTOS Images from The Lego Movie Instead lets consider why a film about the unassuming little plastic lock blocks that have captivated kids and bedeviled vacuum cleaners and bare feet for generations works so well on the big screen.Having a cast that knows precisely how to play with a good line helps and ""Lego"" has done well in that regard. Chris Pratt Elizabeth Banks Will Ferrell Will Arnett Liam Neeson Morgan Freeman and others bring the inherently inert to vibrant life.But it is instructive to go back to the source the toy itself for more clues. Ingenious in its simplicity endless in its creative possibilities made for building up and tearing down yet nearly indestructible accompanied by instructions that can be followed or completely ignored.Directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller wisely adopt the fundamental principles in constructing this zany 3-D world. The pair who were the creative team responsible for the charming 2009 adaptation of ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs"" also wrote the ""Lego"" script. They know how to shake and bake the kid stuff so that adults will bite too. From the first frames the film is grounded in that classic Lego debate whether to stick with the plans provided or go freestyle. The clash between uniformity and diversity becomes the central conflict that drives the action which may actually surpass ""Transformers"" levels and I wasnt sure that was possible.PHOTOS Billion-dollar movie clubLord Business/President Business/The Man Upstairs (Ferrell) -- basically the bad guy who runs everything -- is a rigid sort unsettled by change and on a campaign to stamp it out. Hes got crews working to homogenize the metropolis of Bricksburg where Emmet (Pratt) a very ordinary guy and our unlikely hero lives.Just to be clear because they are making a major point here there is nothing distinctive about Emmet. His days dont vary he follows the same routine eats the same food laughs at the same sitcom joke. When someone tells him ""Dont get any ideas"" he says guilelessly ""I never have any ideas.""Even so Emmet couldnt be happier. His life is awesome. His friends are awesome. His job? Awesome. The construction worker gets to demolish buildings every single day. A lot of interesting ideas are seeded into the simplicity -- understandable to youngsters in a literal sense; amusing to the older crowd for the broader implications.When Emmet takes an accidental tumble down a metaphoric rabbit hole his very structured existence comes crashing down too upon discovering there is much more to the world than Bricksburg. It would be ironic if Emmet understood irony that just as his worldview is expanding Business is shutting it down.BEST MOVIES OF 2013 Turan | Sharkey | OlsenThere is a prophesy handed down by Vitruvius (Freeman his Lego man looking a lot like a blind prophet) which is keeping the anti-Business resistance alive. It involves something called the Kragle (one of several word teases the film employs) the infamous Piece of Resistance and the Special a mysterious master builder who will save the world. Things get really complicated when Emmet is mistaken for the Special.Things get even more complicated when he develops a crush. She rides a souped-up cycle her name is Wyldstyle (Banks) and she has an immediate effect on him -- everything goes slow-mo and in this movie that really stands out. Watching Wyldstyle toss her helmet hair as if it were Pantene perfection ranks among the films best effects.As Emmet soon discovers there are many superheroes fighting Business extinction plan. Batman (Arnett) is the most problematic because hes Wyldstyles boyfriend. The basic good versus evil battle really boils down to a fight against conformity particularly the kind of conformity adults tend to enforce and kids tend to resist. There is a little twist at the end of the film to tether the animated ideal to the real world that is kind of nifty though Im not sure it was necessary.While not a groundbreaking concept it is smartly told and peppered with wry riffs on pop culture as well as unexpected historical high points. So dont be shocked to see Abraham Lincoln (Will Forte) Green Lantern (Jonah Hill) Shakespeare (Jorma Taccone) and Superman (Channing Tatum) going for a punch line with equal energy. PHOTOS Movie sneaks 2014Sometimes its the simplest things that bring such pleasure -- Neesons Bad Cop/Good Cop for example. With a quick spin of his head he goes from fearsome to friendly and becomes a more arresting character for it. Sometimes its the most complex things that steal the scene -- take Nick Offermans Metal Beard. With his many moving-and-morphing pirate parts (and quite possibly pirated parts) hes a remarkably creative contraption. If only hed stay still long enough to see all the nuts and bolts. The same can be said for the animation and effects in general. It is impossible to overstate the scale of their inventiveness the details are delightfully dense.Now to the elephant in the room -- or I guess the Lego on the floor. If youre wondering if the film plays like a 90-plus-minute commercial strangely it does not. There is a very familiar feel to the film which remains true to the style of those ubiquitous bits and pieces that are EVERYWHERE.

The same might be said for this feature-length animation about the zany adventures of some anthropomorphic Lego characters as they battle a corporate CEO (given voice by Will Ferrell) whos outlawed creativity in favor of uniformity and forces his products on the masses. Writer-directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller who displayed a knack for slapstick with 21 Jump Street (2012) fill the script with delightfully absurd one-liners and sharp pop culture references. But contrary to the themes of nonconformity and anticonsumerism this is essentially a big-screen advertisement for the popular construction sets.

A film that fits with the whole family. Directors Phil Lord Christopher Miller (140). PG Animated action violence. Area theaters. Lets say this for ""The Lego Movie"" Its a shining example within a highly dubious genre. As full-length toy advertisements go you really couldnt ask for more. Writer-directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller are experts at adaptation work having also given us ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs"" and ""21 Jump Street."" Both films show they know how to turn potential disasters into unexpected delights -- and the third time is the charm. Unlike you Miller and Lord considered a key detail a Lego pieces personality. Both the excitement and frustrations of playing with stiff interlocking blocks are distilled into their main character Emmet (voiced by Chris Pratt). From left Wyldstyle (voiced by Elizabeth Banks Emmet (Chris Pratt) and Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman in the animated adventure ""The Lego Movie"" Emmet is an apt hero for a Lego adventure movie He passes his days carefully following instructions -- also apt -- in an ordered existence. But his life is upended when he meets the rebellious Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) who introduces him to another side of the Lego world -- one that Lord Business (Will Ferrell) is planning to take over. Together they -- and various Lego figures like a cop (Liam Neeson) an old man (Morgan Freeman) Batman (Will Arnett) and Superman (Channing Tatum) -- have to use all available materials to defeat him. From left Emmet (voiced by Chris Pratt) Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) and Batman (Will Arnett) in the animated adventure ""The Lego Movie"" There are some great messages here about teamwork imagination and courage but its hard to ignore the biggest point of the movie ""You need Legos to do all this cool stuff so dont you want to buy them as soon as the movie is over?"" Still Lord and Miller dont sink into cynicism. Their computer animation embraces the retro look and feel of the toys to both ingenious and adorable effect. (Skip the expensive and unnecessary 3D ticket though.) The witty screenplay is written to entertain adults as well as children. And the cast -- which also includes Jonah Hill in one of the best gags as a really annoying Green Lantern -- is totally on board. Its such a good time that kids of all ages will leave the movie buzzing to play with Lego - and thats a blessing and a curse.

Warner Brothers The Lego Movie explodes onto screen. Those Danish pieces of plastic have an agenda in the years smartest coolest new movie You might not realize it yet but weve just set your weekend plans Take the kids to The Lego Movie -- the funniest cleverest most exhaustingly exhilarating animated feature in ages -- then leave them to play with their toys and see it again for your own wicked amusement. A few days each year every family deserves to be happy. To a short list of wonderful animated features about cloth or video playthings -- Pixars Toy Story trilogy and Disneys Wreck-It Ralph -- add this delight from directors and co-writers Phil Lord and Christopher Miller. The liveliness of their Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs cartoon and the live-action 21 Jump Street hardly prepares audiences for their ability to transform blocky Lego figures with painted faces and no arm or leg mobility into charming or rapacious characters a viewer can instantly accept and believe in. The technique which combines stop-motion animation and CGI has an aptly rough faux-primitive look as if some brilliant kid made a madly elaborate home movie the whole world could love. (MORE Richard Corlisss Review of Lord and Millers 21 Jump Street) The story which moves so fast that viewers should wear seat belts begins in the super-regimented city of Bricksburg where employees of the megalith Octan Corp. do everything theyre supposed to work in the Octan factory (this is an alternate America that still has a thriving manufacturing sector) drink overpriced beverages (32 no 40 for a cup of coffee) watch the nightly sitcom Where Are My Pants? and follow the Instruction Booklet as their Bible. Our hero Emmet (voiced by Chris Pratt from Parks and Recreation) is the droniest of drudges he consumes the party line yet feels ignored by his longtime co-workers -- because they completely ignore him. One day he stumbles upon the legendary Piece of Resistance a toy piece that could trigger the revolution dreamed of by underground rebels including the blind seer Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) and the prole punkster Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks). They believe Emmet could be the Special One the Neo of the Lego Matrix which would make him ""the greatest most interesting most important person in the world"" -- basically the Dos Equis guy with a liberal agenda. (""When he proposes s single-payer health plan Republicans vote for it."") Emmet is none of these things at least not yet; hes friendly but a little short of IQ which leads Wyldstyle to conclude ""Its brilliant that youre pretending to be a useless nobody."" He and the insurrectionists must battle long odds to overthrow the Legoland ruler lord and tycoon President Business (Will Ferrell). (MORE Mary Pols on the Similarly Energetic Wreck-It Ralph) ""Hi Im President Business president of the Octan Corp. and the world"" his genially authoritative voice booms across the land. ""Lets take extra care to follow the instructions"" -- and he malevolently whispers ""Or youll be put to sleep"" before returning to his cheerful pitchmans tone -- ""And dont forget Taco Tuesdays coming next week"" Under his secret identity of Lord Business he plans to glue the world together with a weapon known as KRAGLE (KRAzy GLuE) so that ""everyone will stop messing with my stuff."" To this nightmare amalgam of John D. Rockefeller Boss Tweed Kim Jong Il and some bratty rich kid who wont share his toys conformity is peace and imagination is insurrection. Like Mayor OHare in The Lorax and the evil oil baron in the 2011 relaunch of The Muppets business is bad Bad baaad -- exactly the attitude youd expect from a company founded and based in socialist Denmark whose name comes from the Danish phrase leg godt or play well (with others). We expect no less from those movie Trotskyites on the Left Coast. Wrote Christian Toto last July on Breitbart.com ""The Lego Movie is the latest example of Hollywood drumming anti-capitalist messages into its youthful audience."" Has the Fox News Channel chimed in yet with its jeremiads? (MORE The Fox New and Business Take on The Lorax) No question that the movie promotes what Prez Biz would call a subversive message Be creative with your toys. It also urges kids to venture out of the virtual world they live in and use their hands for something other than typing. But if the Lego Movie workers have seized the means of production its only to increase production -- to sell more toys and tickets for a film whose official title is The Lego(r) Movie. With a market value of 14.6 billion the Lego Group is the worlds largest toy company and with a single almost infinitely adaptable product. Over the years it has produced 560 billion Lego pieces or about 80 for each person on the planet. (Confession I was never a Legomaniac. So somebody out there must have 160 pieces.) Sales will surely increase from this feature-length infomercial which summons hundreds of other characters that have been franchised to Lego. Wyldstyles boyfriend is Batman who may be less interested in her than in his Gotham-saving rep. Instead of Christian Bale who played Batman in The Dark Knight trilogy Lord and Miller go with Will Arnett whos even funnier. Channing Tatum not Man of Steels Henry Cavill voices Superman. But some Lego franchisees bear the original voices Shaquille ONeal from the NBA All-Stars set and Anthony Daniels (C-3PO) and Billy Dee Williams (Lando Calrissian) from the Star Wars movies. (SEE The New Lego Set for The Simpsons -- House and Family) Toward the end the movie get pretty meta with a live-action sequence suggesting that the most authoritarian dude in toyland could be the Dad who shouts ""Leggo my Lego."" But this simply reinforces the tactics and tone of the picture which says anything goes when imagination runs gloriously rampant. Anticipating blockbuster status Warner Bros. has already bruited a sequel. Thatd be fine but wed like to see Lord and Miller set loose on other brands from Scandinavia. The Ikea Movie anyone?

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet In the final third of The Lego Movie a father and son argue over whether Legos are ""just toys"" or a ""highly sophisticated interlocking brick system."" While one stumps for following instructions to keep everything in rigid order the other favors letting imagination run wild. As it turns out theyre both kind of right. This is a surprisingly emotional zenith for what could have been just a feature-length advertisement or vehicle for product placement. Phil Lord and Christopher Miller the creative team behind Clone High Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs and 21 Jump Street have created another unexpectedly rousing and poignant adaptation of a beloved seemingly ""unfilmable"" property.Similar to the Lego Star Wars ""brickfilm"" shorts and Bionicle direct-to-video films The Lego Movie employs CG animation to mimic the appearance of a world made entirely out of Lego bricks and populated by the traditional yellow mini-figures. This approach lacks the tactile pleasures of stop-motion but nonetheless creates a slick vivid aesthetic. In a city that operates like clockwork cheerful but lonely construction worker Emmet (Chris Pratt) goes about his days unnoticed by those around him. Soon however he stumbles into a big adventure accidentally fulfilling the prophecy of a wizard (Morgan Freeman) at odds with Lord Business (Will Ferrell doing a mixture of Mugatu and Megamind) a dystopian overlord determined to maintain the rigid borders between Lego realms and quash creative building. Rescued by the mysterious Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) Emmet journeys between worlds that correspond to familiar Lego-set themes while a class of remaining ""Master Builders"" unite to destroy the villains secret relic weapon.Typical of a Lord/Miller project The Lego Movie is packed to the gills with jokes from throwaway lines to bits of slapstick to highly referential sight gags. (During POV shots from the perspective of the Master Builders the filmmakers even provide ID numbers that correspond to actual Lego pieces.) Furthermore the film is littered with myriad cameos from many of the big-name licensed characters under Legos umbrella (Will Arnett as Batman Channing Tatum as Superman Cobie Smulders as Wonder Woman etc.) but these familiar figures are always employed in service of the films playful and winking humor. Its the funniest blend of pop-culture icons since Wreck-It Ralph.Emmet borders on oppressively optimistic but his companions doubt his ability to even contribute much less fulfill a savior prophecy. Instead of making Emmets generic ""believe in yourself"" attitude the films moral center The Lego Movie underscores the idea that extraordinary abilities can be found in unlikely places. (One of Anton Egos best lines from Ratatouille ""A great artist can come from anywhere"" resonates here as well.) But the meta narrative goes one step further with a twist that adds another thematic layer concerning how toys should be played with and the negotiation between following instructions and following creative whims. That is after all the simple beauty of Legos--designed with a specific architectural purpose but open to ambitious re-interpretation.The only real bone to pick with The Lego Movie is that the gender disparity of the toys themselves--a pervasive criticism of the brand--has carried over to the films major characters. The secondary conflict is decidedly a father-son story. Wyldstyle though confident and talented often exists to play the foil of Batman (her jerk boyfriend) and Emmet (the object of her mild envy then affection). And the only other major female character voiced by Alison Brie isnt portrayed as a mini-figure making Wyldstyle the catchall female protagonist.Still in creatively approaching a corporate property--one so ubiquitous it has its own network of theme parks--Miller and Lord have gone far beyond the call of duty. Their Lego Movie is effervescent in style conveying a substantive message without ever devolving into saccharine preachiness. In three consecutive films Miller and Lord have taken a beloved picture book a soapy teen police drama and an iconic toy set and each time emerged with a final product stronger than the building blocks they were given.

Review The Lego Movie tiny toys huge laughs fosters.com Writer Posted Feb. 5 2014 at 800 PM Updated Feb 5 2014 at 837 PM Posted Feb. 5 2014 at 800 PM Updated Feb 5 2014 at 837 PM Young and old fans alike know the joy of dumping a set of Legos on the floor and chucking that instruction manual. After all throwing a portion of a helicopter on an incomplete racecar could produce the ultimate hybrid.In ""The Lego Movie"" the toy brands first theatrical feature (there have been previous straight-to-DVD movies and also video games) audiences are encouraged to wave off routine.Lego doesnt need a 3-D animated flick with a 60 million budget to drive sales but it should expect a spike after this uproarious yet touching tale hits theaters.When average construction worker Emmet (voiced by an endearing Chris Pratt) accidentally falls into a pit at his worksite he is met by Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) a sassy Goth chick channeling Trinity in this ""Matrix"" for kids. Wyldstyle believes Emmet is a ""Special"" master builder who can save Bricksburg from the evil President Business (played with charming bite by Will Farrell) who wants to douse the town with a Krazy Glue-like substance called kragle.Unfortunately Emmet is a reluctant hero but not because hes shy. Hes just never really had an original thought. Hes been more than happy to adhere to every rule become overly excited about taco Tuesday and adore any song on the radio. (The addictive ""Everything Is Awesome"" pops up throughout.)A lax-toned Morgan Freeman plays Vitruvius the almighty wizard who helps Emmet believe hes more than just a mediocre block of plastic by encouraging him to trust his instincts.Written and directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs"") ""The Lego Movie"" ranks high among other animated favorites about courageous toys such as ""Pinocchio"" and ""Toy Story."" Lord and Miller nail the fuzzy ""believe-in-yourself"" message and score with a spoof-heavy yet engaging plot.Film editors David Burrows (""Happy Feet"") and Chris McKay (""Robot Chicken"") create stop-motion animation thats perfectly paced so the story never lulls. The facial expressions of the mini-figures move as any other animated characters would but the Lego bodies remain robotic and true to real-life form.However it is fun to see how the animators conceive a wavy sea. (The film was made using an astounding 3863484 unique bricks.) The effects stretch the imagination just enough but not so much as to deter from an all-too-familiar Legoland setting.Lord and Miller ensure that the laughs persist as they focus on Legos ability to be the butt of the joke. Batman (Will Arnett) who plays a major supporting role is a bit of a bully and when Emmet attempts to rally a band of familiar ""good guys"" with a speech highlighting his ordinariness we see that Wonder Woman the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and even Milhouse from ""The Simpsons"" could care less. And by mingling the Lego world with ""relics"" like a Band-Aid nail polish remover and a mostly eaten sucker (Vitruvius staff) the mockery ensues.The filmmakers could have easily made one long monotonous ad for the beloved brand thats been around for more than 55 years. Instead theyve created a delightful tale championing self-reliance and distinctiveness. And though it detours from a strict brick world in the final act the cheery humor always clicks.""The Lego Movie"" a Warner Bros. release is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association of America for ""mild action and rude humor."" Running time 100 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four. fosters.com Writer Posted Feb. 5 2014 at 800 PM Updated Feb 5 2014 at 837 PM Comments are currently unavailable on this article >>  STAY INFORMED Email NewsLetter Sign Up Today Sign up for our newsletter and have the top headlines from your community delivered right to your inbox.

With one -- well with hundreds of them -- you can build anything houses airplanes house-airplanes. You can even build something that will change the world as Larry Page and Sergey Brin did in 1996 when they housed the server for their new invention Google in handmade Lego casings. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Yet each brick is constricted by rules. Pieces have one dot four dots eight dots but rarely five. They come in red and blue but never plaid. Ovals are scarce triangles nonexistent. Invented in Denmark on the cusp of World War II Lego for the next four decades offered only a world of uninhabited buildings devoid of people and life like the watercolors Hitler painted in art school.And when the Lego gods created man the ""mini-fig"" he was startlingly conformist. Each had the same height and same face and if the company hadnt forbidden its toys to dress up as soldiers (a brave choice given the kid appetite for war games) they could have served as the perfect playset with which to re-enact The Triumph of the Will.Film DetailsCritics Pick The Lego Movie RatingPG-13 More Info Trailer More recently Lego has found freedom through segmentation. Instead of the jumbled box of bits of my childhood Legos now come packaged in licensed kits with pictures and instructions showing children exactly what to make be it Star Wars Millennium Falcon Tolkiens Tower of Orthanc or Bruce Waynes Batcopter.

The only thing to do thats truly free is throw away all the packaging and invite a kid to create anew.So yes consider the contradictions of the Lego. Because The Lego Movie writers-directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller have. To their credit they have embraced the commercial and the cynical creating a goofy cartoon that will sell enough tickets and toys to keep their bosses happy while facing head-on the fact that these bricks are kinda well fascist.Our hero is a mini-fig named Emmet Brickowski (Chris Pratt) a construction worker (of course) who discovers he is the prophesied chosen one a Hollywood trope as stiff as his joints. He awakens in a darling dystopia where everyone has a smile on their face and a specific role to play be it barista cat lady or surfer.Theres only one hit show Where Are My Pants? and one hit song the excruciatingly catchy Tegan amp; Sara and Lonely Island jam ""Everything Is Awesome""And when Emmet despite his passionate desire to blend in and follow the roles inadvertently finds himself glued -- glued of all things -- to a non-Lego red rectangle he winds up the target of the evil President Business (Will Ferrell) a looming figure in towering brick KISS boots along with his robot minions and a head-rotating policeman named Good Cop/Bad Cop (Liam Neeson.)At least conformity has one plus When Bad Cop runs Emmets profile through the police scanner his face is so generic that it matches everyone in the computer.Lord and Miller have a deft and daring sense of the absurd. They give us a world where everyone is literally a cog make us root for Emmet to build things hes only dreamed of and then circle back and ask if there can be too much creativity as when Emmet and his allies -- Batman (Will Arnett) an astronaut (Charlie Day) a pink unicorn kitten (Alison Brie) a rebellious punk (Elizabeth Banks) and a godlike Lego sage (Morgan Freeman natch) -- attempt to make a submarine without coordinating their plans. Should there be a supreme builder? And with the appearance of mysterious man-size relics -- a golf ball a bandage and most threateningly a tube of Krazy Glue -- is it possible that theres a larger supreme builder that none of them has ever seen?The theological implications are such a pleasurable head trip that its a disappointment when The Lego Movie zooms out in the third act to show us the humans calling the shots. Did some exec say theyd sell 22 percent more toys if they showed someone famous actually playing with this stuff?But the casting misstep is balanced out by Lord and Millers commitment to mining the material for every possible joke explosions that look like Cubist art Bad Cops attempt at ironic air quotes the ability to transform your enemys plane into a baby carriage the inability to tell Lego Gandalf from Lego Dumbledore.In sequel-crazy Hollywood where corporate partnerships increasingly are calling the shots Lord and Miller are the best in the business at making creative intelligent comedies out of pre-existing properties such as Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs and 21 Jump Street. They care unlike the paycheck-cashers who churn out movie versions of Hasbro toys as though theyre just connecting starlet A to plot point B by rote.Lord and Miller do great work within constraints taking premade pieces and fashioning them into feats worthy of applause. Its no wonder they made a Lego movie -- and its no wonder its so good.THE LEGO MOVIE | Written and directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller | Warner Bros. | Citywide1 Wyldstyle (voiced by Elizabeth Banks) left Emmet (Chris Pratt) and Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman)PHOTO COURTESY OF WARNER BROS.

Pictures MOVIE REVIEW The Lego Movie Running time 100 minutes. Rated PG (mild rude humor mild action). At the E-Walk the Kips Bay the Orpheum others ""EVERYTHING IS AWESOME"" is the name of the bouncy central song in ""The Lego Movie."" At last A movie with something to say. Yet a slight ironic adjustment connects the movies main song to its themes one of which is that everything sucks. As cute and energetic as it is ""The Lego Movie"" is more exhausting than fun too unsure of itself to stick with any story thread for too long. The action scenes are enthusiastic colorful but uninvolving like an 8-year-old emptying a bucket of plastic blocks. A wise old prophet (Morgan Freeman) is overcome by the villainous corporatist Lord Business (Will Ferrell) who seizes the evil weapon the ""Kragle"" which turns out to be Krazy Glue that threatens to cement everybody in place. Lego world the wizard says can be saved from the Kragle only by an unsuspecting random guy dubbed ""the Special"" who turns out to be Emmet (Chris Pratt) an oafish construction worker. Emmets a likable chap who doesnt deserve the insults thrown his way by everyone else -- not just a ruthless cop (Liam Neeson) on his trail but a butt-kicking avenger Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) who rescues him and her boyfriend Lego Batman (Will Arnett doing an amusing growl). Even Batman gets in on the action in ""The Lego Movie.""Photo Warner Bros. Pictures The humor ranges from slapstick to rapid-fire pop allusions that are ""Simpsons""-style but not ""Simpsons""-caliber. Much of the latter consists of meta-jokes (a Green Lantern voiced by Jonah Hill sucks up to a jockish Superman voiced by Channing Tatum; a line of dialogue goes ""blah blah blah proper name place name back-story stuff"") or feeble little stabs of satire. Asked for his favorite eatery everyman Emmet says ""Any chain restaurant."" Because . . . no little kid would be caught dead in one of those? Here is a movie in which a 15 billion toy merchant and a 57 billion entertainment conglomerate join forces to lecture us on the evils of buying. Despite lots of gags about how dull and conformist Emmets world is the anti-consumerist drum isnt beaten to shreds the way it was in ""The Lorax."" But none of the other ideas work very well either. Digitally animated to look like the stop-motion process behind those Gen-X beloved 1960s cartoons the film is lovingly detailed but spoofs are better suited to sketch comedy. They tend to grow monotonous at length. The old stop-motion productions loved their characters and developed stories in scenes backed by what now looks like Shakespearean patience whereas ""The Lego Movie"" is all toddler-meets-Red-Bull chaos. The experience is like being trapped inside a popcorn popper. Not until the very end with an awkward pullback from the toys to the boy playing with them is there even an attempt to deliver some ""Toy Story"" heart but the theme of this final act (that Legos arent for grown-ups) is about as profound as a Trix commercial. I picture Buzz Lightyear watching ""The Lego Movie"" and announcing ""Star command request evacuation pod immediately. Sugar-rush explosion among tiny life forms has created hazardous comedy debris field.""

"Review The Lego Movie 4.5 stars Article Comments () Things to do >> Movies >> Article Review The Lego Movie 4.5 stars SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments RELATED NEWS Chris Pratt talks Lego Building a Lego movie Lego filmmakers No guns By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Thu Feb 6 2014 328 PM ""The Lego Movie"" is a delight a funny fast-moving film that should satisfy adults and children alike. To say that its far better than it has any business being would be correct and somewhat demeaning. Directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller tongues squarely in cheeks have made a movie based on toys without it seeming like a 100-minute commercial. The slightly glitchy movement of the characters is funny the animation is awesome the deconstruction of superheroes is brilliant and the jokes are knowing and slightly edgy. If the death-metal song Batman wrote for his girlfriend about being an orphan doesnt win you over the surprisingly emotional climax will. Emmet Brickowoski (voiced by Chris Pratt) like all the other characters a Lego toy is a construction worker. (There is after all a lot to be built in a Lego universe.) Like the rest of the population he wakes up happy every morning singing the universal nauseatingly catchy theme song ""Everything Is Awesome."" But is it really? Sadness lurks beneath that little drawn-on smile. Emmet doesnt really have any friends. Hes kind of a cipher. And theres something a little unnerving about the way everyone follows directions to the letter. In actual fact the whole place is run by President Business (Will Ferrell) who demands a bland sameness because deviating from the directions scares him. Every block has its place every character its mission. Change is not tolerated. It all has to do with a prophecy that involves the emergence of a Master Builder who will save the people although they dont know they need saving. Its all a little fuzzy but Morgan Freeman provides the voice for Vitruvius the one issuing the prophecy so who would complain? (Freeman pokes some fun at his image which is great.) One day after work Emmet sees a stranger poking around the construction site. This is of course not allowed. But before he can call in the mandatory report about anything unusual he gets a better look at Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) and is smitten. Then he falls down a hole. And down and down and down and down. At the bottom he finds the Piece of Resistance the prophesied secret weapon that will save everyone from President Business evil plan. (Just go with it. Its worth it believe me.) Wyldstyle and Vitruvius assume that Emmet is the Master Builder of lore the one who will save everyone. In reality hes quite a bit less than that but he tries to live up to the hype. So Emmet and Wyldstyle set off on an adventure to figure out how to use the Piece of Resistance and prevent the end of life as they know it. Bad Cop (Liam Neeson) is determined to stop them. And sorry but thats about as much of President Business scheme as you should know going in. Along the way Emmet and Wyldstyle enlist the aid of other Legos such as the aforementioned Batman (Will Arnett laugh-out-loud funny) the picture of arrogance; Unikitty (Alison Brie); Benny (Charlie Day) a ""1980s-something space guy""; and Metal Beard (Nick Offerman) a pirate built of cast-off parts. As random as some of the action is it turns out theres an overriding reason for it. And again no more should be said about that. But the payoff is richly satisfying. They noodle around a little too much in the middle of the film figuring things out but thats a quibble. Theres so much to like about ""The Lego Movie"" (and so much to see that repeated viewings will doubtless be rewarded). Its just a lot of fun. And youll always wonder How does Green Lantern (Jonah Hill) really feel about Superman (Channing Tatum) after all? Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr EVERYTHING (IN THIS MOVIE) IS AWESOME The LEGO Movie hits on all the right notes creating a truly memorable film. (Warner Bros) A The LEGO Movie Genre Animation; Starring Elizabeth Banks Will Ferrell Chris Pratt; Director Phil Lord Chris Miller; Release Date Wide 02/07/2014; Runtime (in minutes) 101; MPAA Rating PG; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted February 19 2014 -- 1200 AM EST Animators work with more freedom than other filmmakers -- theoretically they can visualize anything -- but lets be honest In the past few years there has been such a glut of big-studio digital-cartoon features made in a conventionally pleasing market-tested style that animation in effect has stopped surprising us. Frozen much as I liked it was jammed with overly familiar princess/sidekick/journey-of-redemption tropes. And its hard to think of the last time a Pixar film made you go ""Wow"" Thats part of why The LEGO Movie is such outrageous and intoxicating fun. It may be a helter-skelter kiddie adventure built out of plastic toy components but its fast and original its conceptually audacious its visually astonishing and its 10 times more clever and smart and funny than it needed to be. Here at last is an animated comedy that never stops surprising you. Its also startlingly sophisticated. The directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller have forged The LEGO Movie almost entirely out of digital imagery but they replicate the primitive eye-popping high of stop-motion animation creating a LEGO universe as if it had been built piece by piece. Like Toy Story 19 years ago the film fools your eye into thinking its watching real plastic that moves and the connection to the Toy Story films doesnt end there. The LEGO Movie likewise invents a kind of child-friendly meta universe in which the playthings on display are at once objects and characters. The transparently fake LEGO constructions embody the pure spirit of make-believe. Emmet Brickowski (voiced by Chris Pratt) is an ordinary-Joe construction worker a LEGO Minifigure with a peg for a head. Each day along with his Bricksburg neighbors he chews over last nights episode of a sitcom called Where Are My Pants? gets rooked for designer coffee at 37 bucks a pop and bops along to the feel-good robotized disco anthem ""Everything Is Awesome."" The LEGO Movie skewers a fascist entertainment state in which corporations now dictate every momentary pleasure. Using the building-block world of LEGO to parody the creeping conformity of our world The LEGO Movie proves even more biting than WALL-E because it has the sauciness to send up its own rise-of-a-hero story line. Presenting with poker-faced mockery a white-haired wizard named Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) and a natteringly contentious group of superheroes from Batman (Will Arnett) to Green Lantern (Jonah Hill) to Abraham Lincoln (Orville Forte) the film wittily satirizes the overblown solemnity of fantasy franchise filmmaking. Youd expect the hero to be a nonconformist but Emmet who has all the personality of a PEZ dispenser really isnt special. Thats part of the movies subversive cheekiness. Lured by a sexy LEGO Minifigure named Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) he falls in with a group of outcasts who think hes the Master Builder -- i.e. the One who can overthrow President Business (Will Ferrell) the CEO of the nation who is also Lord Business a Vader-like despot. The films comedy is very digressive very free-associational (think Team America meets Family Guy). And though near the end The LEGO Movie takes a leap into outside-the-frame storytelling that may not have been necessary that leap still neatly channels the films theme If you build it life will be awesome.

Print Email Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on February 06 2014 at 706 PM updated February 06 2014 at 710 PM comments It is an adult satire that slyly mocks our culture of conformity devotion to mindless entertainment and a political system so entwined with big business the two have become indistinguishable. Oh and its also a kiddie cartoon. About a building-block toy. Yes its time for ""The Lego Movie"" and although the idea seems as ridiculous as basing a movie on an amusement park ride like ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" (the first one anyway) it uses that dizzy high concept to do something fresh and fun. And also this time just a little subversive. The story is set in Bricksburg where our hero lives a very dull and predictable life as a construction worker. Until one day hes informed that he is The Special -- a chosen once-in-a-generation leader whose mission is nothing less than to save the universe. Pretty heavy stuff for a guy with a painted-on face. On the surface ""The Lego Movie"" is undemanding fun. Although its computer animated it mimics stop-motion style with its characters clunky movements. Will Ferrells villain -- President Business -- is delightfully silly as are some of the supporting characters. Yet theres an intelligence at work here. Theres its cheeky willingness to spoof the Lego world of tie-in characters (the ""Star Wars"" heroes come in for a ribbing and there are some particularly good running jokes about a pretentiously pessimistic Batman and seriously annoying Green Lantern). And theres an interesting ongoing conversation about creativity itself tied to the different ways real kids actually play with the toy Is it better to work as a team and follow the instructions or go off on your own and use your imagination? (In the end the film finds merit in both.) But while all thats there to mull over directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (who also worked on the script) delivers plenty of entertainment too including fast non-stop action. (A little too fast and non-stop in fact; the movie rushes through some of its plot and the chase scenes are nearly dizzying.) Also enjoyable are Chris Pratt who provides the dependable voice of everyman Emmet and Elizabeth Banks as Wyldstyle the sassy adventurer assigned to protect him by wise old guru Morgan Freeman. Theyre all fine but its even more enjoyable to hear Liam Neeson bringing a sense of fun to a very bipolar police officer or spot some surprise guest stars like ... wait Billy Dee Williams? Yet while you and your kids are enjoying the jokes and surprises Lord and Miller (who also did ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs"") go back to sneaking in that snark including pointed digs at our rat-race lifestyle and its dippy distractions. (The No. 1 hit in Legoland? An insistently insipid dance track called ""Everything Is Awesome"") And in its own small plastic-brick way ""The Lego Movie"" is pretty awesome too. It rushes things a bit too much in the beginning and drags things out too much in the end (which also indulges in some obvious sentimentality). But like the toy its based on its goofy and colorful and something adults and children can enjoy together. And unlike that toy you dont have to worry about stepping on it in the dark in the middle of the night. Ratings note The film contains some toy-on-toy violence. The Lego Movie (PG) Warner Bros. (100 min.) Directed by Phil Lord Christopher Miller. With the voices of Chris Pratt Will Ferrell Elizabeth Banks Liam Neeson.

"The Lego Movie Review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies REVIEW The Lego Movie  Video The Lego Movie I cant wait to see it again Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips reviews ""The Lego Movie."" (Posted on February 6 2014) Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips reviews ""The Lego Movie."" (Posted on February 6 2014) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Finally A comedy that works. An animated film with a look -- a kinetic aesthetic honoring its product lines bright bricklike origins -- that isnt like every other clinically rounded and bland digital 3-D effort. A movie that works for the Lego-indebted parent as well as the Lego-crazed offspring. A movie that in its brilliantly crammed first half especially will work even if you dont give a rip about Legos.""The Lego Movie"" proves that you can soar directly into and then straight past product placement into a realm of the sublime if youre clever enough. This isnt just the funniest PG-rated animation in too long; its the funniest film period in months since the kid-hostile ""This Is the End"" and ""The Worlds End"" came out last summer. I would like to nominate the screenwriting team of Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (""21 Jump Street"" ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs"") for the Nobel Peace Prize even though very little about ""The Lego Movie"" is peaceful. It is in fact a manic wonder sneaking in so many small medium and large jokes on the sly it has an instantly re-watchable appeal. The setup of ""The Lego Movie"" also directed by Lord and Miller recalls both ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" and the recent ""Wreck-It Ralph"" in its mashup of familiar characters and imaginative worlds. (Confession I always found ""Roger Rabbit"" a technically remarkable but mean-spirited drag and consider ""Wreck-It Ralph"" clever but exhausting. So consider that when considering my response to ""The Lego Movie."")The prophecy dictates that the one who will save the world is a person born with ""face of yellow."" So says the Yoda-style soothsayer voiced by Morgan Freeman. The hero? An ordinary Lego construction worker with the classic waist-bendy design and fondness for right angles and orderly skylines of many colors. Emmet is his name and he lives and resides in the bustling community of Bricksburg. This worlds overlord President Business (Will Ferrell doing the vocals in full snivel) has nefarious plans for maintaining that order permanently. But a mighty band of resistance fighters has other plans and pretty soon safe routinized anonymous Emmet is mistaken for the saviors ringleader and mastermind even though hes never really put much stock in individuality. Hes a good little Lego. The way Chris Pratt of ""Parks and Recreation"" voices this fellow his sweetness is never in doubt. The movie flings Emmet and the audience into one Lego universe after another. Theres a Wild West sequence that owes as much to ""Son of Paleface"" as anything else. When other Lego favorites are introduced into the action -- Will Arnett voices an exceedingly narcissistic Batman -- theyre given distinct and vivid comic personalities. Liam Neeson is superbly cast as the voice of the quick-change artist Bad Cop/Good Cop tasked with capturing Emmet and implementing the end of Bricksburg as we know it.Each facet of Emmets world is part of an insidiously entertaining mind-control experiment. The citizens of Bricksburg all tune into the same officially sanctioned hit show ""Where Are My Pants?""; everyone sings the same annoyingly hummable hit song ""Everything Is Awesome."" (Mark Mothersbaugh of Devo did the score.) This isnt paradise; its hell. Or both. The satires extremely deft and even when Lord and Miller working with animation co-director Chris McKay indulge their snarky postadolescent sensibilities with one too many torture sequences the style of the animation doesnt mistake ""realism"" for ""quality."" Were happily and fully in thrall to the stop-motion Lego world writ large to the point that when a huge change occurs at the climax its a bit of a killjoy. We dont really want to leave the Lego world even for sincerely wrought pathos and a complicatedly affecting message to parents everywhere.Nick Offerman pirates his way merrily through the role of Metal Beard; Elizabeth Banks is Wyldstyle the driven revolutionary with the mad motorcycle skills. The sight gags most of them quick as an eyeblink are shrewdly timed; considerable credit goes to editors David Burrows and McKay who really know how to bite off the end of a scene at precisely the right moment.I suppose its a bit much toward the end. A little more breathing room en route mightve helped sell the heartfelt wrap-up. But most of the way ""The Lego Movie"" plays like the worlds greatest fan tribute and I cant wait to see it again. mjphillipstribune.com""The Lego Movie"" - 4 starsMPAA rating PG (for mild action and rude humor)Running time 140Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Movies Entertainment Animation (Movie Genre) The LEGO Group PG Rated Movies Wreck-It Ralph (movie) Morgan Freeman REVIEW The Monuments Men  Latest movie reviews The Lego Movie Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising73deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-lego-movie-review-20140204,0,2605492.column",200,thelegomovie37,thelegomovie,chicagotribune

If the producers of The LEGO Movie had taken either approach there would have been an outcry these lifeless plastic bricks are too beloved too iconic to be subjected to the Hollywood sausage-factory treatment. Luckily for all someone had the foresight to bring in Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs writer-directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller and the result is bold berserk and strangely beautiful exuding LEGO-love from every frame.Our everyman hero Emmet (Chris Pratt) is the happiest guy in Bricksville hes gainfully employed as a construction worker (what else?) he adores his co-workers and he knows that the mighty President Business (Will Ferrell) has his best interests at heart. So when hes thrown into an epic conflict between Businesss robot clones and the forces of creativity and invention (led of course by Batman and Abraham Lincoln) all Emmet wants is to get back to normality.Occasional pacing issues aside The LEGO Movie is sheer joy the script is witty the satire surprisingly pointed and the animation tactile and imaginative. Expect controversy over the climax though. The film plunges deep into waters left uncharted since the mid-80s leading to a strange deeply sentimental but oddly touching climax that manages to say more about its source material than any toy movie to date. Barmy perhaps but often brilliant.

TWITTER Directors-screenwriters Phil Lord and Christopher Miller bring the building bricks to life with a voicecast that includes Chris Pratt Will Ferrell Elizabeth Banks Will Arnett Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman. After successfully testing the computer-animated waters on the smaller screen with the likes of LEGO Star Wars and LEGO Ninjago not to mention a series of hit video games everybodys favorite Danish interlocking brick system has finally been transformed into a big 3D animated feature--with wildly entertaining results. Arriving at a time when feature animation was looking and feeling mighty anemic--essentially reconnecting the same dots until the next big thing comes along--The LEGO Movie shows em how its done. Its a non-stop blast from beginning to end jam-packed with a wacky irreverence dazzling state-of-the-art CGI (courtesy of Animal Logic) and a pitch-perfect voice cast headed by Chris Pratt Elizabeth Banks and Will Ferrell. PHOTOS 35 of 2014s Most Anticipated Movies Backed by an army of executive producers the Warner Bros. and Village Roadshow presentation should translate beautifully into whatever corner of the earth it plays with a laugh-and-youll-likely-miss-something potential for repeat viewings. Not that there was ever much doubt about co-directors and writers Phil Lord and Christopher Miller being the right guys for the job having previously surprised with Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and 21 Jump Street but their gift for inspired lunacy hits fresh imaginative heights in the anything-goes LEGO universe. Serving as the idealistic heart of the picture is Emmet (endearingly voiced by Pratt) a sweet but generic regular guy of a LEGO minifigure with a prodigiously empty mind blissfully content to let instruction manuals be his guide. And thats just the way President Business (Ferrell) wants it.  A control freak of a CEO with world domination on his mind his obsessive disdain for creative expression has turned him into the maniacal Lord Business whose bidding his carried out by the swivel-headed Bad Cop/Good Cop (Liam Neeson). PHOTOS Todd McCarthys 10 Best Films of 2013 But Emmets non-descript life is about to find meaning in a construction excavation pit when he stumbles across the elusive Piece of Resistance and in the process is earmarked as The Special--the one prophesied to reunite the great Master Builders and remove Lord Business from power before he destroys their various worlds. Joining Emmet on his reluctant quest is the sassy butt-kicking Wyldstyle (Banks) whose rebellious streak is represented by the hot-pink and turquoise ones in her hair; and Vitruvius a blind hippy-dippy sage (a hilariously loose Morgan Freeman). Theyre soon joined by Wyldstyles bf Batman (a terrifically self-absorbed Will Arnett) and the cringingly sweet Unikitty (Alison Brie) who presides over the no-rules Cloud Cuckoo Land along with numerous special guests. Not only do Master Builders Lord amp; Miller who crafted the script from a story by Dan Hageman amp; Kevin Hageman (Hotel Transylvania) manage keep all those careening bricks in the air with crack comic precision they sneak in an affecting third act reveal thats absolutely in lockstep with the venerable brands creative spirit.

(Just ask comedian Patton Oswalt whose filibuster on ""Parks and Recreation"" about crossing ""Star Wars"" with ""The Avengers"" became a viral sensation.) At its best ""The Lego Movie"" highlights the possibilities of such unfettered combinations of pop culture staples celebrating the childhood ethos of dumping all your toys on the floor and letting Barbie take Pikachu to G.I. Joes fort so they can fight off the dread Raggedy Andy. In the same way that ""Toy Story 2"" supported using and loving your toys rather than imprisoning them as collectibles in mint packaging ""The Lego Movie"" endorses throwing out the instruction guides and letting your Justice League Simpsons and Lord of the Rings playsets commingle. See video Chris Pratt Chosen to Save the Lego Universe in Warner Bros. Trailer Said endorsement is made clear enough that even the youngest audience members will get the message but where ""The Lego Movie"" goes astray is in grinding the movie to a halt to make sure that message is understood by every single ticket buyer. Its the kind of spoon-feeding thats insulting to both children and their minders and it sucks the fun out of what is otherwise a fast-moving lark of an animated comedy-adventure. In the grooved-plastic world dominated by the evil Lord Business (voiced by Will Ferrell) everyones a conformist dullard following instructions about every facet of the day numbing their brains with overpriced coffee irritatingly catchy pop songs (get ready for Jo-Li and the Lonely Islands ""Everything is Awesome"" to invade your cerebral cortex) and inane sitcoms like ""Where Are My Pants?"" (As happy dopey dystopias go its not too far removed from the one in ""Idiocracy."") Hear audio LEGO Movie Song Everything is AWESOME The Catchiest (and Dumbest) Song Youll Hear This Week A cheery cog in the machine is Emmet (Chris Pratt) someone so lacking in identity that even in this blank world hes considered a nobody. That all changes when he stumbles upon the Piece of Resistance the only artifact that can destroy Lord Business power by nullifying his super-weapon the Kragl. Rescued by mystic Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) and rebel Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) Emmet is assumed to be ""the chosen"" a master builder who will save this reality from Lord Business crushing conformity. The plot such as it is exists mostly as a framework to spotlight the many characters featured in the Lego universe and you dont have to be a Comic-Con pass-holder to enjoy watching Batman (Will Arnett) rub shoulders with Han Solo (Keith Ferguson) and Shaquille ONeal (as himself). The quartet of writers (directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller of ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" and Dan Hageman and Kevin Hageman of ""Hotel Transylvania"") seem to be having the most fun when they get to toss out non sequiturs like an encounter between Michelangelo the artist and architect and Michelangelo the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle. Also read Matrix Bullet Time Scene Re-Created ... in Legos But while the films underlying message about creative independence and playfulness is a strong one the movie takes a third-act turn (which wont be spoiled here) thats bold but ultimately wrong-headed restating what weve already figured out and ruining the delicate balance of this movies goofy click-and-snap universe. Bright colorful fast and noisy ""The Lego Movie"" will doubtless tickle young fans of the toys. Its just too bad that a movie that encourages you to think for yourself doesnt follow its own advice.

The typical Lego minifigure stands just 4cm tall though of course the popular construction toys hold a much bigger place than that in childrens imaginations. ""The Lego Movie"" understands how fans interact with the brand and answers with a mile-a-minute geekstravaganza that immerses kids -- and the adults who only think they outgrew their old playsets -- at ground level with the tiny plastic bricks. Just as they did with ""21 Jump Street"" and ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs"" before this most ambitious undertaking co-helmers Phil Lord and Christopher Miller irreverently deconstruct the state of the modern blockbuster and deliver a smarter more satisfying experience in its place emerging with a fresh franchise for others to build upon. To the enormous credit of these preternaturally clever writer-directors the above paragraph contains more low-hanging Lego puns than the movie itself which relies on ingenuity and genuinely inspired twists on what audiences expect from such an experience to deliver a constant stream of engagement and laughs. Once exclusively the domain of Saturday morning cartoons where they functioned as feature-length commercials for the brands in question toy-based entertainments now lead the box office and an assignment like this -- which will massively affect the bottom line of the product in question -- could have gone any number of ways. On one hand ""Toy Story"" had long since cornered the sincere ode-to-childhood-playthings approach while the ""Transformers"" and ""G.I. Joe"" movies went the overkill route all but obliterating the notion that those bombastic adventures could in any way relate to how kids use the related toy products and treating them more like the afterthought tie-ins ""Star Wars"" and other films typically support. But ""The Lego Movie"" demonstrates something altogether different. The film functions as a massive homage to a shared childhood experience amplified and projected on the bigscreen. So while the result is undoubtedly the single most product-centric film of all time its also just hip and irreverent enough to leave audiences feeling as though its makers managed to pull one over on the business guys. Theyve gotten away with something upholding and expanding the worldwide Cult of Lego -- the plot literally serves to cement the right and wrong way to play with the product -- while good-naturedly skewering consumer culture at large. The experience opens with a bombastic but not-entirely-serious confrontation between a power-hungry Lego figure named Lord Business (Will Ferrell back in evil-with-a-wink ""Megamind"" mode) and good wizard Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman poking fun at every voice-of-authority figure hes ever played) for a force that gives whoever possesses it control of the entire Lego universe. This powerful entity is trumped only by the ""Man Upstairs."" And so the Lego people live in a state of primitive superstition torn between their ambitious new leader -- who reinvents himself as President Business issuing an elaborate system of ""instructions"" that keep his citizens tightly confined to their respective realms -- and the mysterious godlike entity whose hand can reach down at any time to rearrange everything according to his own design. As anyone who has played with Legos knows a strict adherence to the rules makes for relatively mindless play whereas things can really get fun when one dumps all the bricks onto the bedroom floor and starts freestyling creations from scratch even if that means blending pieces from pirate castle space and city sets (which is precisely the sort of disorder President Business aims to quash). According to an ancient prophecy repeated by Vitruvius one day a ""Special"" will arise to dismantle the rigid conformity that governs the Lego universe -- a concept that echoes Warners own ""The Matrix"" albeit with none of that films self-seriousness of tone. Where Trinity did the honors in that film a sexy goth chick who calls herself Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) inadvertently introduces Emmet (""Parks and Recreations"" Chris Pratt) an endearingly empty-headed construction worker to the notion that certain Master Builders have the power to recombine available pieces into anything they can imagine. This encounter has profound existential implications for Emmet who had previously been content to follow the rules buying expensive coffee watching braindead TV and singing along with an insidiously catchy anthem called ""Everything Is Awesome"" that keeps the citizens of Bricksburg working building and buying in lockstep. Now with his little yellow mind blown Emmet is pulled into a renegade adventure to help Wyldstyle thwart President Business plans to cement his neatly ordered Lego world in place with a substance called Kragle (actually Krazy Glue with a few of the letters rubbed off its tube). With ""Robot Chickens"" Chris McKay in charge of animation and editing (with co-editor David Burrows) the pic clips along with quick cut-to-the-gag abandon. And much like last years ""Wreck-It Ralph"" (or the more tonally similar ""Adventure Time"") ""The Lego Movie"" anticipates a certain attention-deficit quality in its audience constantly plunging the action into new and different realms while poking fun at the various characters and customs that make each sort of silly along the way. From the outset Lord and Miller decide to respect the idea of Lego while reserving the right to poke fun at anything and everything the brand encompasses including (nearly) all the other creative properties that have licensed themselves to Lego in recent years -- at least all those that fall within the expansive Warners universe plus some of the sillier one-offs (including mermaids and clowns and so on). That means DC superheroes can exist alongside the NBA All-Stars (Shaquille ONeal even lends his own voice) and the Harry Potter wizards have a chance to bicker with those from ""The Lord of the Rings."" More importantly given the films flip approach it means that no one is being so protective of the way that say Batman (Will Arnett) or the ""Star Wars"" characters are presented that a team of lawyers was allowed to swoop in and spoil the fun. Instead everything is subject to the directors silly-making sensibility especially the plot itself which may as well have been borrowed from every other brink-of-disaster epic. So while Emmet and his minifigure friends go about trying to save the day the film takes a step back to reveal the live-action world in which their tiny travails are situated earning not just laughs but a measure of genuine sentiment in the process. Lego fans have been making their own Lego movies for years to the extent that the company even introduced a ""Lego Studios"" line in the year 2000 that included a Steven Spielberg-lookalike director and a working stop-motion camera. In choosing the look of their big-budget production Lord and Miller stick to that aesthetic using computer animation to simulate the surface texture and slightly jerky movement we might expect if someone had orchestrated the entire experience with  plastic toys painstakingly repositioned and photographed one frame at a time (according to the press notes that would have taken no fewer than 15080330 bricks). Such things may not seem important to the casual observer but the creative team had to make important decisions about how the characters move and behave committing to a look that mirrors how the plastic pieces appear in real life They can be taken apart and reconfigured but they dont bend (the way they do in Lego videogames). At the end of the day everything remains molded plastic complete with visible nicks and scratches. The tiny faces appear ""painted"" on but are also interchangeable which supports Liam Neesons hilariously conflicted police officer (whose head rotates to reveal both Bad Cop and Good Cop personalities) and a wide range of crazy caricatured expressions for everyone else. As in Lord and Millers two previous pics the directors allow things to swell bigger than the assignment requires and the story gets away from them a bit in its final third. The difference here however is that theyve built in a separate level on which to watch the entire experience inviting audiences to enjoy the creativity of the construction itself -- which is something the film shares with any child whos ever invented an unintended use for an existing Lego piece. They have fun representing elements such as fire and water with repurposed plastic or introducing ""relics"" (such as Band-Aids and housekeys that somehow got mixed up with the Legos) into the characters midst. The wildly creative result -- lively and ultimately more than a little overwhelming -- embodies precisely what is meant when something amounts to more than the sum of its parts.

Reply Orion says February 4 2014 at 1034 am I got inspired by The Lego Movie Check out this spoof I made on the trailer The LEGO(r) Movie - Official Main Trailer [HD] - Sweded Trailer Winner {zaregomubi} Ying Hua Yu Gao Bian (2014) It was pretty fun to make let me know what you think) Reply John Shea says February 4 2014 at 123 pm Brilliant Orion MUCH better than the official trailer. They should hire you to make the sequel and save 100 million. Reply Gc says February 3 2014 at 1259 am This reviewer sounds and feels like he is getting some money under some table from Warners to be VERY gung-ho and super optimistic about this....or he has some stock attached to it Its way too overboard with his positive likability Is this guy even an honest critic? Reply JOhn H says February 3 2014 at 737 pm Oh shut up. I bet youre the life of all the parties. Reply CC says February 3 2014 at 1020 am So because a review was really positive you assume that the reviewer is paid off or not credible? Its that impossible that the movie is actually very good? Reply blah says February 3 2014 at 801 am Youre just jealous because youre in debt and dont have a job. Reply Just Confused says February 3 2014 at 1227 am LEGOS small grosses HUGH All other things being equal... this could lead to a SEQUEL Reply Ryan says February 2 2014 at 950 pm It looked terrible Reply Truth says February 3 2014 at 908 am Agreed Reply Riley H says February 2 2014 at 351 pm A perfect review. Saw the film on Saturday and it is my new favorite film. A spectacular piece of animation and a wonderful story. The film really emphasised everything LEGO represents. Ive been a big fan of the directors for a while (Since CWACOM) and this film made them jump up my list of favorite directors. Now that Ive seen it a week early Im bummed I have to wait a whole week to see it again Im sure all LEGO fans will see it but if any of you had doubts about its quality do not fear. It even surpassed my high expectations. My girlfriend (who isnt that big into LEGO) was still laughing along with the rest of the audience and Benny is her new favorite character. Bring your kids your friends your SOs and your parents. Everyone will love this film. Reply John Shea says February 2 2014 at 240 pm ""Thou shalt not dump all thy bricks onto thy bedroom floor and start freestyling creations from scratch blending pieces from pirate castle space and city sets"" Signed GOD PS I really look much cooler than Morgan Freeman... Reply wednesdayware says February 3 2014 at 943 am The film is a joy to watch but a mess in it message. Instructions are bad freestyling is good. President Businesss table is FILLED with Freestyle built buildings. The catchy theme song is meant ot poke fun at bland same type culture but is featured throughout the film. The company that makes the bricks and sells them in specificly designed sets is telling us that building those sets is dumb that we should use our own creativity to build but points fingers at the people who do just that. Its a bit of train wreck messagewise. Reply Neil says February 10 2014 at 1038 am I suspect you need to rewatch the film - I think you missed the point. The message isnt ""instructions are bad/freestyling is good"" - the message is ""creativity and rule-following both have value in the appropriate time and place"". Carl Doone says February 2 2014 at 1256 pm So cute - the big baby likes Legos Reply LOL says February 2 2014 at 1224 pm Sounds crap.
