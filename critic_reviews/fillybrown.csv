Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Sean OConnell April 26 2013 Water down the gene pool that birthed fiery hip-hop dramas like ""8 Mile"" and ""Hustle amp; Flow"" and youre left with ""Filly Brown."" A routine music business cautionary tale the film shuffles its decks ever so slightly by casting a Latino actress as its lead but doesnt do enough to shed the exasperating confines of the star-is-born genre. Gina Rodriguez breaks a sweat trying to rescue ""Filly Brown"" from mediocrity. A versatile young talent shes asked to keep a lot of plates spinning in this Sundance Film Festival favorite -- and somehow avoids blame when most of those dishes fall to the ground and shatter. ""Filly Brown"" is a stage name adopted by Majo Tonorio (Rodriguez) a tough but sensitive L.A. street poet who frequents the studios of a popular Internet radio program because the hosts let her spit freestyle rhymes over electronic beats. Fillys natural talents lure a sleazy music producer whose first order of business is to sex up her act. That in turn opens the door to a possible record contract with local music mogul Big Cee (Noel Gugliemi) though Filly is ordered to burn bridges between her friends and family to make that dream a reality. Fillys rapid ascension and inevitable decline should have been enough to sustain an inspiring musical fable particularly with a magnetic personality like Rodriguez leading the charge. The actress rips through spoken-word raps laced with political and ethical messages about and for the Latin American community. Rodriguez convinces us that Filly has a voice that needs to be heard. Sadly that voice is drowned out by too much manufactured melodrama. ""Filly Brown"" writer-director Youssef Delara stifles Rodriguezs performance with multiple cliched story lines that distract from the artists journey and generate little tension. Maria (the late Jenni Rivera) Majos incarcerated mother is pushing for a retrial because the police officer who testified against her might have lied. Jose (Lou Diamond Phillips) Majos proud but cash-strapped father cant hold down his landscaping gig. And Lupe (Chrissie Fit) Majos promiscuous younger sister falls into a harmful relationship with a man who hits women and assaults Majos boyfriend Eddie (Jorge Diaz) with a baseball bat. Delara shoots ""Filly Brown"" using washed-out cinematography that gives Southern Californias valley suburbs an arid tint. Like many indie filmmakers hes guilty of an overreliance on jiggly hand-held cameras. And the films soundtrack lacks a memorable tune that would help keep ""Filly"" in the audiences head long after a screening. Thats not the key missing ingredient though. Even with the assorted hardships waiting for Majo outside of the studio ""Filly Brown"" lacks the urgency that fuelled both ""8 Mile"" and ""Hustle amp; Flow."" Those films did a fantastic job of convincing us music was the only ticket out of a hellish existence for their protagonists. Majo on the flip side has supportive friends a loving (if slightly fractured) family unit and a decent suburban abode to fall back on. I never believed that Filly Brown desperately needed to succeed. As a result I dont think the film succeeds either. OConnell is a freelance writer. 1/2 R. At Loews Rio Cinemas 18 and Fairfax Corner 14.

Olmoss variation on the too-familiar subgenre (the rising inner-city superstar here is a Latina tomboy) is more heartfelt humanistic and entertaining than such a cliched showbiz cautionary tale has any right to be.

"Review Filly Brown a fierce tale of a promising hip-hop rapper - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Movies_nowReview Filly Brown a fierce tale of a promising hip-hop rapperGina Rodriguez is formidable as the title character in a heartfelt drama that also features a notable Jenni Rivera in her first and last film role.April 18 2013|By Amy Nicholson A scene from ""Filly Brown."" (Indomina Releasing )Rapper Filly Brown (Gina Rodriguez) is tomboyish and politicized spitting lines like ""Do you even see the Latinos serving you Chinese?"" over a flamenco-inspired beat. Shes the sound of Los Angeles a and so too is her eponymous movie ""Filly Brown"" which even gives a key role to local Power 106 DJ Khool-Aid and her weekly syndicated Latin hip-hop show ""Pocos Pero Locos.""Fifteen months after its Sundance Film Festival premiere this heartfelt drama from director-producers Youssef Delara and Michael D. Olmos is finally reaching theaters. Its a familiar showbiz soap opera Can Filly resist the sleazebag producer trying to transform her from firebrand feminist to sexed-up ""street vixen""? Can she shield her naive 17-year-old sister (Chrissie Fit) from her dastardly label mate (Joseph Julian Soria)? Can father (Lou Diamond Phillips) keep lawyer (Edward James Olmos) from telling the girls the truth about their family? We can guess the answers yet almost despite our will the cast keeps us invested in Fillys furious resurrection.Rodriguez is forthright and formidable a festival ingenue who deserves to be discussed in the same breath as Elizabeth Olsen and Jennifer Lawrence. (Ahem Neither of them did their own rapping.) But the breakout performance belongs a painfully a to banda superstar Jenni Rivera who died in a plane crash last December. In her first (and last) film role Rivera plays Fillys manipulative mother a convict serving 10 years in Chino. Its a haunting unglamorous performance and when the prison guards take her away we wish she could stay longer.----------------------------""Filly Brown.""

Rodriguez is engaging smoothly blending a street-wise quality with a vulnerable aura. A nimble rapper shes more convincing than many of the of the cast members.Unfortunately the film is marred by a story situations and stereotypical characters that strike all-too-familiar chords. Majos socially conscious rap about Latinos as ""economic slaves"" is perhaps the only real fresh element.MORE The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYMajos mother Maria (Rivera) is in prison for drug-related crimes and her father Jose (Lou Diamond Phillips) a construction worker is struggling to provide for Majo and her younger sister Lupe (Chrissie Fit.)Majo sees a recording contract as a way to help her family particularly her mother who she believes was wrongly imprisoned. She secretly visits her mom and is determined to raise several thousand dollars for a legal appeal. Edward James Olmos (whose son Michael is the co-director with Youssef Delara) plays attorney Leandro Chavez.She gets a spot on a local hip-hop radio station and shortly afterward achieves some local success. Then just as quickly Majo begins to lose her down-to-earth identity and authenticity as an artist and turns her back on friends who helped her along the way.But through it all Rodriguez imbues her character with a plucky can-do charm that brings to mind a younger grittier Reese Witherspoon. When she slugs slimeball rapper MC Wyatt (Joseph Julian Soria) who cold-cocked her 17-year-old sister Rodriguez does it believably. Her Majo is tough and fiercely loyal. But she also has some uncharacteristically naive moments.On the one hand shes a street-smart woman who counsels her underage sister to keep away from shady guys. Yet she caves in easily to her moms desperate requests to pay a man thousands of dollars to ""gets things done."" Clearly the guy is a sleazy drug dealer. Majo talks about refusing to give up on her mother and perhaps shes in denial. But helping her get drugs hardly seems consistent. Why would the screenwriters give such a clearly intelligent character such a huge blind spot?Rodriguez is a natural rapper with a strong voice and she displays remarkable ease on camera. Phillips is wisely understated as her noble but flawed father. Olmos brings a lived-in ease to his lawyer role. Majos musical colleague and possible romantic interest DJ Santa (Braxton Millz) is another winning presence.However most of the supporting performances are one-note. Riveras role is small toggling between belligerent and teary.The script is uneven marred by a predictable arc and some overheated scenes. But theres an inherent likability and fiery quality in Rodriguezs performance that keeps us invested and rooting for her character. 9 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/15ohHhj",http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~r/UsatodaycomMovies-TopStories/~3/8yZa9nq5EnY/?utm_source=feedly,200,fillybrown3,fillybrown,usatoday

Presenting a tough profile but revealing a soft inner core ""Filly Brown"" tells a familiar saga of a no-nonsense Latina rapper and her struggles at home and in the biz. Despite the contributions of no fewer than four writers including co-directors Youssef Delara and Michael D. Olmos the resulting film is a trite piece of storytelling with character development and plot points that feel not so much lived in as borrowed from other movies. Slick surface a song-filled soundtrack and lots of young faces will draw buyers but commercial prospects are limited. A regular performer on an Internet radio show Majo (Gina Rodriguez) has adopted the rapper name of Filly Brown and is bent on making a name for herself in the male-dominated hip-hop world. After visiting her mother Maria (Jenni Rivera) in prison Majo learns the cop whose testimony put Maria away is under investigation and persuades her legal-aid attorney Leandro (Edward James Olmos) to fight to vacate the verdict. This proves however to be the first of many dead ends and outright falsehoods on Marias part but Majo is so determined to get her released that that she considers even compromising her music which shes previously sworn to pal and DJ Santa (Braxton Miltz) that shed never do. The prospect of legal fees compels Majo to go along with big-talking small-time producer Rayborn (Pete ""Chingo Bling"" Herrera) and sex up her act which has been distinctly political feminist and confrontational in tone. The fact that Majo and her performing crew including a somewhat reluctant Santa enjoy their resulting club gig raises questions about where Majos head is at Is she a calculating operator or a dedicated artist ready to stick by her principles but momentarily taking advantage of an opportunity? When she subsequently jumps over to a hot label run by the aptly named Big Cee (Noel G.) and leave Santa behind it appears this question has been answered. Underneath though the film wants to suggest that Majo is still the real deal. Such a confused conception of its protagonist dogs ""Filly Brown"" consistently as the troubled script juggles too many plotlines to remain nimble and fresh. Majos blind fidelity to Maria -- despite plenty of warnings from caring but tough father Jose (Lou Diamond Phillips in the films best performance) -- draws her into an ill-judged plot involving cash and drugs. Especially problematic is a subplot involving Majos rival egotistical rapper MC Wyatt (Joseph Julian Soria) which distracts from the main matters at hand. Fortunately for the film the rapping is real though curiously lacking in lyrics in Spanish and/or the Spanish-English hybrid language that makes Latino hip-hop so distinctive. Rodriguez gamely handles the assignment once the songs start and delivers some impassioned beats though the role presents her with significant obstacles on the likability front. A confessional monologue by Phillips easily reps the pics high point exquisitely Catholic without being religious for a moment. Ben Kufrins widescreen lensing on the Red camera often emphasizing soft browns and brilliant whites is ultra-pro despite cliched L.A. street shots. Krystyna Lobodas highly versatile production design reps a huge contribution. Filly BrownProductionA Cima Prods./Olmos Prods./Silent Giant Entertainment presentation.

TWITTER A dynamic breakout performance from Gina Rodriguez helps this rap-infused drama about a young Los Angeles Latina overcome its patchy storytelling. PARK CITY - As both an actor and a rapper Gina Rodriguez gives an empowered performance in Filly Brown playing a young Los Angeles woman angling for hip-hop stardom as a means to help spring her mother from prison. But the heavy-handed untidy story sense of co-directors Youssef Delara and Michael D. Olmos means not everything that surrounds the central figure has the same grit and authenticity. Borrowing stereotypical situations from urban African-American dramas and reworking them with Latino characters is not the same as bringing something fresh to the screen. But the intensity of Rodriguezs work the muscular energy and slick style of the film and the pumping soundtrack should give it some commercial traction. Raised by her construction foreman father Jose (Lou Diamond Phillips) ever since her junkie mother Maria (Jenni Rivera) was incarcerated on drug charges Majo (Rodriquez) has had to grow up fast. That includes keeping her pretty 17-year-old sister Lupe (Chrissie Fit) in line. Jose wants the girls to stay away from their mothers toxic influence but Majo visits her in secret. Informed by her mother of a possible break in her case Majo seeks help from Marias lawyer (Edward James Olmos). But Maria cares less about legal assistance than about raising 3000 to pay a shady-sounding contact who ""gets things done."" Why Majo never questions this ambiguous strategy -- even as shes forking over the hard-won dough to a patently sleazy operator -- is one of many ways in which Delaras screenplay undercuts the characters intelligence. An amateur rapper Majo gets an open-mic spot on local hip-hop radio. Adopting the name Filly Brown she channels fierce conviction into kick-ass verses her mother claims to have written before things turned sour for her. She also sucker-punches cocky guest MC Wyatt (Joseph Julian Sora). The performance and her feisty attitude earn her the professional and romantic attention of resident spinner DJ Santa (Braxton Millz) and the managerial interest of self-inflated music promoter Rayborn Ortiz (Chingo Bling). Again during her exploratory inroads into the music business Delaras script denies Majo the smarts she deserves making her reckless and naive. Abandoning the militant Latino rap she and Santa have been experimenting with she allows Rayborn to sex up her look and add a generic hoochie chorus. That puts her on the radar of producer Big Cee (Noel Gugliemi) whose sneering unscrupulousness borders on caricature. It also puts her in the same circle as Wyatt who takes an instant liking to Lupe. Its problematic when an audience knows way before the supposedly savvy main character that shes being taken advantage of by her mother as well as compromised as an artist. But despite the inconsistencies of plot and character and the unevenness of much of the acting Rodriguez brings such fire to the part that we keep rooting for Majo even as she makes stupid decisions that bring dire consequences. Laconic but warm Phillips is saddled with a half-baked attempt to add narrative texture when the patronizing realtor employing him suggests he fire his heavily tattooed buddies and dress to impress her potential buyers. But while this is a useless digression Joses refusal to erase his identity ultimately spurs him to be more open with his daughters about the past. That strengthening of the family unit gives the film some welcome emotional kick in the concluding stretch.
