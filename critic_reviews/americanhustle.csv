Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Dec. 20 2013 1200AM EST Last updated Tuesday Dec. 24 2013 843AM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by David O. Russell Written by Eric Warren Singer David O. Russell Starring Christian Bale Amy Adams Bradley Cooper Jennifer Lawrence Jeremy Renner Classification 14A Year 2013 Country USA Language English The new David O. Russell film American Hustle begins with a shot of Christian Bales sagging gut and then moves up to the mirror where hes assembling his comb-over a squirrels nest of strands glued-on toupee and spray a proudly unconvincing monument in defiance of middle-aged loss. Apart from proving once again that Bale - dumpy and balding here - will do anything to prove hes really not Batman the hair-styling scene sets up the theme of American Hustle which is about appearances and cons and pathetic aspiration. MOVIE REVIEW Video Weekend movie pick Jennifer Lawrence and big-bellied Christian Bale shine in American Hustle Video Video Five must-see movies to add to your list this holiday The movie is Russells third backhandedly affirmative holiday offerings in the past four years following The Fighter (2010) and last years Silver Linings Playbook. The true-ish script by Russell and Eric Warren Singer is based on the Abscam scandal of the late seventies and early eighties when a dubiously zealous FBI sting operation brought down politicians from the municipal level to the U.S. Senate using a convicted con man and an agent disguised as a rich Arab sheik.The title American Hustle could define much of the movie year The Great Gatsby Blue Jasmine the upcoming The Wolf of Wall Street - all scam movies that call to mind the great unpunished 2008 Wall Street rip-off. But Russell is less interested in crime and punishment than in individuals and especially actors particularly when theyre working at warp speed.Bale who starved himself for The Fighter has packed on pounds here bulging in his colourful disco-era suits as he slumps through his role as hustler Irving Rosenfeld with an uncharacteristic vulnerability. Theres a touch of the aesthete in Irvings character Hes a con artist with an emphasis on ""artist."" He deals in forged paintings to sometimes supplement his chain of dry-cleaning outlets along with a scuzzier operation of taking money from desperate people under the pretense of getting them secure loans.Irving also has a passion for the buoyant big-band jazz of Duke Ellington which is his first connection with fellow con artist Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) whom he meets at a party. Sydney a grafter who has her own dreams of elegance sometimes assumes the persona of an English aristocrat a pose jarringly at odds with dresses that advertise her earlier career as a stripper.At some point we learn that Irving the would-be ladies man jazz aficionado and dashing art thief also has problem at home. Thats Rosalyn his wife played by Jennifer Lawrence a baby vamp under a beehive of ringlets with a semi-neglected kid from a previous marriage. Rosalyn has a fondness for self-help books and delights in stirring up trouble. In a movie where the fizz keeps getting shaken Lawrence pops the cork in every scene shes in.The short-form description of American Hustle is that its Martin Scorsese the chronicler of New York sleaze and crime meeting Preston Sturges the antic 1940s screwball-comedy king behind The Great McGinty and Sullivans Travels. But Russells Scorsese references are pure parody the voiceover technique and flashy editing the moments of paranoid slow-motion tableaus. Robert De Niro even shows up as a sour all-businesss Mafia boss. Instead of one voiceover we get a clamour of them as if everyone is desperate to sort out the schemes alliances and double-crosses that breed like bacteria in a sewer drain.Ultimately Russell is more interested in the twitches of the individual amoebas than the larger epidemic. In Silver Linings Playbook you may recall Bradley Cooper starred as a bipolar man recently released from a psychiatric hospital. Here he plays a more extreme schemer FBI agent Richie DiMaso who appears to go to the same salon as Ron Burgundy his hair permed tightly as though hes trying to keep his lid screwed on.Posing as a guy in need of a loan Richie manages to bust Irving and Sydney only to use them as his dupes. In spite of the objections of his dour agency supervisor (an excellent Louis CK) Richie decides to blackmail Irving and Sydney into helping him in his federally-funded con to ensnare shady politicians. At stake is financing for a massive renovation project in Atlantic City N.J. The first of several targets is Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner in an Elvis pompadour) as a New Jersey mayor whos just too trusting and ambitious.American Hustle barely earns our sympathy for this crew of hyperventilating chiselers and marks. Russell earns our respect for the scripts puzzle box of tricks though theres an excess of scenes featuring manic sociopaths arguing in small rooms. Save your admiration for the performances especially Lawrence who is now Hollywoods most important presence in front of the camera. At 23 shes proved her dramatic chops (Winters Bone) established herself as a global-franchise action star (The Hunger Games X-Men) and under Russells tutelage emerged as a terrific comedienne scoring an Oscar for her role in Silver Linings Playbook. The character of Rosalyn - a mash-up of Carole Lombard Lady Macbeth and maybe even Regan from The Exorcist - is by far the most hair-raising phenomenon in a movie bristling with high hair.

Scam bam thank you maam. Director David O. Russell (209). R Sexuality language. Village 7 Regal E-Walk Lincoln Square. Theres a great fever-dream quality to David O. Russells ""American Hustle"" that instantly reels you in. This terrific fact-fiction mashup revolves around the late 1970s-early 1980s Abscam scandal in which FBI agents and con artists joined together to catch pols taking illegal cash. The movie itself works like a great shell game. No matter how closely you watch ""American Hustle"" surprises you. It turns out that comb-overs cleavage cocaine and kookiness are an unbeatable combo. Christian Bale wears the first of those as Irving Rosenfeld a balding paunchy Long Island shyster whose two-bit schemes involve phony bank loans and selling forged artwork. Irving officially runs a string of dry-cleaning shops but he sees himself as more than that. Into his life walks Sydney (Amy Adams) a creature of reinvention. An ex-stripper and current striver she sees Irving as access to the good life. Using a fake English accent and calling herself ""Lady Edith"" she becomes a classy gal the suckers can trust. Smart but bloated Irving is in awe of her. Sydney and Irving slip up and are forced into a partnership with rogue FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper). After nabbing Irving and Sydney go-getter Richie cuts a deal with the duo to help him bag white-collar criminals. Then the curveballs start. First they inadvertently find congressmen ready to take money under the table as well as a well-meaning New Jersey mayor (Jeremy Renner) who needs cash to set up casinos and create jobs. Theres even a dangerous Florida mobster (Robert De Niro) who smells the moolah. When Irvings unhinged wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence)gets suspicious of her husbands attention to Sydney she wants in too. Rosalyn is to die for but she could drunkenly flirting with gangsters during a sting operation get someone killed. Jennifer Lawrence and Amy Adams in ""American Hustle"" (Francois Duhamel) ""American Hustle"" uses Abscam (short for ""Arab scam"") a Me Decade footnote to riff on our need to reinvent ourselves. Russell and Eric Singers witty silky screenplay spins multiple plates at once. Every cast member gets a chance to shine. And the cast is familiar with plenty of vets from Russells previous films (""The Fighter"" ""Silver Linings Playbook""). Bale -- that freak of acting nature who can become anyone at a moments notice -- is sad funny and riveting. Adams is simultaneously kittenish and craven. Cooper is terrific as a goofball dying to be taken seriously while lusting after Adams female trickster. Lawrence in just a few scenes captures the frowsy frisky eras slovenly undercurrent. Renner a newcomer to Russells movies adds a crucial layer of slightly crooked conscience. In a movie about wild cards it would be easy to let the visuals spin out of control. Cinematographer Linus Sandgren however keeps the handheld camerawork fluid not frantic. The movie overall never winks at its gaudy moment in time. Russell never opens the door for an easy joke or a lazy reference. The intoxicating parade of losers thinking theyre winners set to a hot soundtrack puts ""American Hustle"" in the company of ""Goodfellas"" and ""Boogie Nights."" But this one is absolutely its own creation. jneumaiernydailynews.com To find film related events in your area check out the Daily News events calendar Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Which will likely -- rightly even -- vex a few moviegoers. And the winking caveat at the start that ""Some of this actually happened"" wont soothe all souls. Director David O. Russell and co-writer Eric Warren Singer grab hold of the FBIs long-time Abscam sting (conducted in the late 70s into 1980) as their kernel of truth then Jiffy Pop it like mad. For a just-as-wild reported account of the FBI operation that hired an expert con man and led to the convictions of one U.S. senator six congressmen and sundry other politicians and players for corruption read the late journalist Robert W. Greenes ""The Sting Man"" (recently reissued in paperback). For those of us willing to be snowed by a vivacious tale of reinvention denial and love among the ruined theres this terrifically performed ride. Christian Bale Amy Adams Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence star. They are simply headliners in a fine ensemble outing. Not one of these actors is a stranger to Russell and each of their performances attests to the trust they place in their director. Bronx-born con man Irving Rosenfeld (Bale) and his partner in love and crime Sydney Prosser (Adams) are so good at their ""from-the feet-up"" fabrications they get nabbed by an ambitious if insecure FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Cooper). Theres no way out but through for the pair as Richie forces them into a white-collar crime sting. That set-up provides ""American Hustle"" its zesty action but the movie is chiefly Sydney and Irvings love story. ""When you ply lies for a living where do you locate your trust?"" is a persistent theme. To help underscore that nagging insecurity is Irvings wife Rosalyn. Lawrence pulls off a character -- appalling and appealing -- that brings to mind Shelley Winters at her voluptuous demanding best not simply simpering. Russell gives Amy Adams her chewiest role to date. The Castle Rock-bred actress should give Oscar front-runner Cate Blanchett a high-heeled foot race. The first shot of Sydney has Rita Hayworth/ ""Gilda"" glamour to it. Only Sydney doesnt toss her mane of red hair she smiles. Her many plunging necklines suggest ""Cosmopolitan"" mag cover-girl couture. Sydney worked for the magazine. Costume designer Michael Wilkinson makes the film as fashion florid as it is forward. Hair too plays more than a supporting role Sydney calls Irvings comb-over ""elaborate."" (Thats euphemism tempered by attraction.) Jersey Mayor Carmine Politos got a pompadour. And theres a phone conversation between Sydney with her hair in curlers and Richie hair in even more rollers that is priceless. Must we say the denizens of ""American Hustle"" are hardly upstanding citizens? In fact the most sincere person on screen is Jeremy Renners New Jersey pol who bends laws to make way for an Arab sheik to donate millions for the renewal of Atlantic City. If you are looking for condemnation of this collection of no-gooders Russell withholds it. Or at least seems to when it comes to the usual suspects. Richie is another matter. He wants to live larger only on the right side of the law. Richie is a revved-up reminder of what can happen when going undercover gives you license to be bad while doing ""good."" What a rush. With its bulging list of targets and reliance on the tricks of entrapment Abscam itself raised questions of law enforcement overreach. While deeper questions about cultures of corruption are here for the pondering they are not Russells point. Reinvention the director insists is our gift -- and our grift. ""American Hustle"" speaks to Horatio Alger aspirations and our endless ability to justify the means to our ends. Still our favorite con of all might be the one film has been perpetrating since its birth the love story. And Sydney and Irvs is a doozy.

Russell Rating R for pervasive language some sexual content and brief violence Running time 2 hours 18 minutes Playing Throughout Orange County (See theaters and movie times)The quick hitThis smart funny and seductive fictionalization of a late-70s/early 80s bribery scandal builds on the talent and invention of the years friskiest ensemble and most energizing soundtrack. Grade A If you used the word ""hustle"" in the period when this caper movie is set - the ""Saturday Night Fever"" 70s - you would have been referring to a dance not a con. Director David O. Russell knows a con is a dance that like the Hustle can be performed by two people multiple partners or a whole line of dancers. His film offers the intense and elating pleasure of watching a top-notch ensemble pull off intricate moves with gusto and spontaneity to a sizzling 1970s soundtrack. Its as if theyre making it up as they go-go. ""American Hustle"" fictionalizes the FBI sting operation called ABSCAM in which a made-up Arab sheikh (a Fed in a burnoose) offered congressmen and other public officials bribes in exchange for political favors. Its eager inventive uninhibited entertainment full of comedy and suspense. Russells sleekest trick as a moviemaker is to log the human and political costs of ABSCAM-like entrapments without losing his comic-dramatic balance. He leaves you feeling high on the audacity of his high rollers and happy at the way it works out for the best of them. This movie swirls and swings - it really does hustle mixing glamorous and earthy moves just like its characters. They want to step up in class as well as in wealth. What makes this film an ""American Hustle"" is how proudly they proclaim theyre ""reinventing"" themselves - and how avidly they give into their hungers and desires. The movie leaves a trace of melancholy in its wake. It demonstrates the waste of American money and energy on juicy corruption scandals that exploit and expose greed but rarely uncover the roots of our socioeconomic rot. The unlikely fellow who inspires Russells vigorous choreography is Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) a Bronx-bred businessman with a string of dry-cleaning stores and his dads old glass-replacement business. Rosenfeld has several ventures on the side including selling forged art and arranging 25000-50000 loans for desperate men in exchange for a 5000 fee. The fee is nonrefundable. The loans are nonexistent. Rosenfeld is a master grifter but Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) lifts his game all the way up to her jugular notch. An Albuquerque girl who adopts an English accent and manufactures an identity as British royalty she convinces Rosenfelds eager clientele that shes connected to the higher better things in life including the finest London banks. Prosser and Rosenfeld bond over their love for Duke Ellington especially ""Jeeps Blues."" They want to emulate the Duke of Elegant - an easier feat for the lithe stylish Prosser than for the overweight balding Rosenfeld. Initially theres one complication. Rosenfeld is already married to a slapstick Long Island domestic goddess named Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence). She has given him a stepson he adores but she also turns psychological manipulation into flaming performance art - shes always igniting fancy new household objects (sun lamp microwave). An even bigger complication comes in the gyrating form of hyper-ambitious FBI man Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper). He apprehends Rosenfeld and Prosser then threatens and manipulates them into collaborating with him on ABSCAM. Whats worse DiMaso has an eye for Prosser and a yen for promotion and fame. He targets Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) a New Jersey state senator and Camden mayor who desperately wants to improve life in the Garden State. Polito beloved by his constituents acts for the public good no matter what minor perks he takes for himself. The source of this movies galvanizing intrigue is that the characters remain in play - they never settle into place. Are Prosser and Rosenfeld soul-mates? (This begs the question do con-people have souls?) Is Prosser making a pass at DiMaso or is she using him to force Rosenfeld to choose her instead of Rosalyn? Does Rosenfeld genuinely feel a kinship with Polito as a neighborhood kind of guy or is he just trying to take control of the scam? Is Rosalyn loony or crazy like a vixen? Is DiMaso a crime-fighting eager beaver or a man who gets off on risk? What could he and Prosser possibly mean when they say they want to be ""real?"" The tricky part of American reinvention is that it lets people like these characters live out a second or third adolescence - and Lawrences Rosalyn is barely out of her first one. Lawrence is amazingly funny and sexy as a woman who pours her id and dexterity into justifying herself and tying Rosenfeld around her little finger. Fingernail polish in fact is her major prop. Adams Prosser thrillingly matches her beat for beat as a woman who is all calculation. She suggests the conflicted emotions beneath Prossers strategies even when she transforms her primal sexuality into a show. She gels perfectly with Coopers riotously impatient FBI man. He conveys enterprising zeal right into the tight curls of a self-administered perm. Rosenfeld often talks about pulling cons ""from the feet up."" In ""American Hustle the actors perform from the hairline down. Bale anchors the movie - and not only because he embraced Rosenfelds comb-over and put on 40 pounds for the role. As Rosenfeld this actor loses his baleful aura and gains a sometimes warm sometimes prickly always worldly wise charisma. Women love him because he savors them. And this slick operator can appear astoundingly un-slick - thats why Renners straight-shooting street-smart Polito becomes his pal. Louis CK registers as the uproarious straight man to the entire movie in the part of DiMasos supervisor a stolid transplanted Midwesterner who never gets to finish a story. Elisabeth Rohm from TVs ""Law and Order"" is a revelation as Politos wife. She and Renner deliver subtle easy-to-underrate performances that form an indelible picture of an old-fashioned happy marriage. These characters may be after riches but these actors deliver something better -- an embarrassment of talents. ""American Hustle"" boasts the kind of art you cannot fake.

"American Hustle a dance worth doing review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesAmerican Hustle a dance worth doing reviewDavid O. Russells 1970s con game satire American Hustle is a dance you want to do and a party invitation you want to take up.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Dec. 19 2013 American Hustle 3.5 stars Starring Christian Bale Amy Adams Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence. Directed by David O. Russell. 138 minutes. Opens Dec. 20 at major theatres. 14A Nomination for the years most shocking cinema sight Christian Bales massive belly swinging free bold and hairy at the start of American Hustle  David O. Russells delightful satire. Its followed by another gasper Bales character Irving Rosenfeld a petty New York con artist living as large as his 1970s dreams fusses before a hotel mirror with a toupee that could send shivers up the spine of Donald Trump. Article Continued Below The man who was Batman gained 40 pounds for this role and also submitted to whatever barbershop savagery was needed to reduce his scalp to a follicular disaster zone. He went method schlub in other words both for the sake of his art and also because hes really into this movie. From left Amy Adams Bradley Cooper Jeremy Renner Christian Bale and Jennifer Lawrence in a scene from American Hustle.  (Francois Duhamel / Columbia Pictures) Theres similar all-in commitment by Bradley Cooper Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence who all dress and comport themselves as if they wandered off the set of Saturday Night Fever . Indeed the ladies flash so much boobage in their permanently NSFW attire its almost as if they want to be ready in case a mirror ball suddenly starts flashing and the needle drops on a disc spinning ""Disco Inferno"" -- although the more appropriate tune for this film might be ""Do the Hustle."" Either way its a dance you want to join and a party invitation you want to take up. Its one of the years cleverest films and also one of the best. ""Some of this actually happened"" the title card reads referring to the parts of this shaggy dog narrative that ricochet off the real con game of the late 1970s and early 1980s known as Abscam when FBI agents posed as Arab sheiks to sucker and collar a passel of corrupt politicians. With this brief nod to reality were off to the races with Russells off-kilter untrustworthy and utterly enjoyable yarn in which Bales Irving is dragooned by Coopers Richie DiMaso an FBI agent on the make to use his conman skills to assist in reeling the bigger fish Uncle Sam really wants to fry. Playing nicey-nicey means a better legal deal for Irving and his partner in love and crime Sydney Prosser (Adams) an ex-stripper who is pretending to be a British aristocrat for the purposes of the profitable scam the two have been running promising imaginary loans to desperate people for a real fee of 5000 a head. Irving and Sydney first meet at a party their eyes locking as Chicagos ""Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?"" plays part of a soundtrack thats as sinuous as Linus Sandgrens camera which rarely stops moving. The tunes zig and zag from Duke Ellington to Led Zeppelin from Wings to Tom Jones like an ancient jukebox with a quarter jammed inside it. Sydney is also doing her best to imagine that Irving isnt married which he is. He also has a son. Not trying at all to forget this important information is Irvings wife Rosalyn (Lawrence) whom youd called a pistol the same way youd call an AK-47 a peashooter. Shes the wild card of this increasingly convoluted (in a good way) saga where youre never quite sure whos zooming who and really dont care. Russell loves these characters whom he helped bring to life with co-writer Eric Singer and he wants us to love them too. Hes been this way since the life and career epiphany of The Fighter  which brought Bale and Adams together winning Bale an Oscar and Adams a nomination. This generosity of spirit was also witnessed in last years Silver Linings Playbook  which teamed Lawrence and Cooper winning her an Oscar and him a nomination. Any wonder why these actors would do anything for Russell? Leave the judgments to judges and bureaucrats (comedian Louis C.K. downshifts for a deadpan FBI boss). To be sure this is serious business the clownish hair and attire notwithstanding. But its hard not to feel some sympathy for Irving who tells us via voice-over that he was raised on robbery doing things like busting windows so his glazier dad would have more work. Irving does bad things but hes not really a bad guy. It figures that hed bond with Jeremy Renners Carmine Politio Mayor of Camden who looks like an Elvis impersonator at a court appearance and whos just trying to do the right thing for New Jersey by doing a bit of the wrong thing money-wise. It occurs to me that American Hustle is the sleight-of-hand movie that Now You See Me wanted to be earlier this year. Now You See Me bored with its fake magic most of it done by CGI. American Hustle entertains and engages with its abundant personal chemistry and buoyant flim-flammery. This includes the coincidental but still amusing rib-poke of having British actor Bale affect an American accent while American actress Adams does a British one. ""People believe what they want to believe"" Irving says. American Hustle proves the maxim right down to the horrendous hair and clothes they all rock like theres no shame and no tomorrow. Correction - January 2 2013 This article was edited from a previous version that mistaknely referred to Jeremy Renners character Carmine Politio as the Mayor of Atlantic City.

Russells ""American Hustle"" loosely based on the 1978 Abscam scandal. (Francois Duhamel) By Ann Hornaday December 19 2013 Follow AnnHornaday A larky anarchic life force runs through ""American Hustle"" David O. Russells screwball homage to the strivers and connivers who wreak playful havoc with what could easily have been a straight-up if antic FBI procedural. Notionally based on the 1978 Abscam investigation wherein an FBI sting used fake Arab sheiks to ferret out corruption within the ranks of Congress and local jurisdictions ""American Hustle"" cheerfully jettisons any pretense of historical accuracy or journalistic shoe-leather. Such carefully footnoted Washington tableaux as ""Argo"" ""Zero Dark Thirty"" and ""Lincoln"" are so last year literally and figuratively The tagline at the beginning of ""American Hustle"" reads proudly ""Some of this actually happened."" In other words Permission granted to leave Wikipedia behind and allow yourselves to be entertained by this rollicking sometimes unhinged shaggy-dog tale. The film opens on Christian Bale unrecognizable behind a prodigiously flabby belly meticulously arranging a toupee and comb-over while the New York news radio station WINS chatters in the background. Its an otherwise silent masterpiece of real-time self-invention which isnt subtext as much as the text of Russells fanciful story about characters who construct identities out of whole cloth not just to deceive but to give themselves the existential juice it takes to get through another day. Bale plays con artist Irving Rosenfeld a Bronx-born sharpie who deals in fake loans and forged art using a dry-cleaning business to launder his dirty money. When Irving meets Sydney (Amy Adams) they find immediate fellowship in worshipping Duke Ellington and harboring hearts full of larceny. Its as if two illusions recognize reach out and touch one another at their deepest most dissembling cores. Once Irving and Sydney cross paths with an ambitious FBI agent named Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) the game is afoot and the three embark on an increasingly elaborate folly during which their shifting personas and motivations come into increasingly dubious question. Russell expertly peels back the layers of the characters ""real"" lives doling out information in stingy delicious dollops. As hes done in ""The Fighter"" and ""Silver Linings Playbook"" Russell follows his rogues gallery closely his fluid discreetly observant Steadicam following just behind or alongside -- an intimacy that makes it all the more startling when a fact emerges that fundamentally alters our understanding of who we thought they were. Bale Adams and Cooper develop a credible explosively volatile chemistry in ""American Hustle"" and Bale is particularly heroic in his portrayal of a blubbery white whale of a man trying to shake that last harpoon. But the film is filled with terrific supporting performances as well from Jeremy Renner as a pompadoured New Jersey mayor and Louis C.K. as DiMasos beleaguered superior at the FBI to that brand of cinematic secret sauce known as Jennifer Lawrence whose voluptuous daffy 1970s housewife (""the Picasso of passive-aggressive karate"" as another character describes her) possesses equal parts unstudied incandescence and Loki-like derangement. Russell is so entranced by his characters that he films them like the stars of an old-school musical swirling across Park Avenue lip-syncing to each other on the dance floor or to Paul McCartneys ""Live and Let Die"" directly to the camera. And hes as entranced by the material culture of this world as he is by the people From the ubiquitous corner ficus tree to mirrored wallpaper every visual cue is as expressive of its era as the Halston dresses that the female characters drape over their bodies with nary a Maidenform in sight. At times Russells exuberance gets the better of him Hes prone to over-relying on music to sell a scene and the reference-upon-reference layering can be exhausting. (In the course of just a minute or two in one crucial sequence we hear Elton John Santana an Arabic version of ""White Rabbit"" and the Bee Gees in quick succession.) But if only as a period piece -- and incidentally a fitting next-decade New York bookend to ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" also opening Friday -- ""American Hustle"" is a joy to watch its infectious brio giving the audience a time-warp contact high. The warmth that courses through ""American Hustle"" makes it irresistible with Russells affection for his characters and his sharp-eyed evocation of their recessionary times honoring their struggle however dishonest rather than denigrating it. If his idealism strikes some viewers as unearned it offers a bracing counterpoint to the unremitting cynicism of the upcoming ""Wolf of Wall Street"" in which greed is the same operating principle albeit with no reassuring third-act redemption. The Martin Scorsese movie that ""American Hustle"" most recalls is ""Goodfellas"" which was propelled by the same jittery expansiveness but was willing to go to exponentially darker places. Russell is content to keep it light preferring to see even his most cracked characters as dreamers in search of the genuine article whether in love friendship or civic virtue. ""American Hustle"" may have taken its inspiration from the art of the steal but it has a heart of pure if slightly tarnished gold.    1/2 R. At area theaters.

Russells film.  |  out of 4 stars By Colin Covert Star Tribune February 26 2014 -- 1101am This photo released by Sony Pictures shows Christian Bale left as Irving Rosenfeld Amy Adams as Sydney Prosser and Bradley Cooper as Richie Dimaso walking down Lexington Avenue in a scene from Columbia Pictures film ""American Hustle."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Theres a mad extravagance to ""American Hustle"" -- the in-your-face 70s furs and disco suits the whipped-meringue hairstyles the multilayered characters the sprawling story. Every frame swells with a pushy chaotic too-muchness aburst with the grasping lunacy of American life. But even at two hours and 20 minutes the movie doesnt wear you down. It carries you along with heedless momentum giddy and exhilarated at its all-American ambition and scam-artist confidence. The plot of this exceptionally funny crime caper is jumbled but intentionally so sliding through flash-forwards and -backs in a way calculated to keep us off balance. It concerns the cut-and-thrust collision of five people who want to make it big. Pot-bellied comb-over king Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale acting the part in bold broad strokes) runs a few Bronx dry-cleaning stores as a front for his interests in art forgery and small-scale financial cons. His ambitions rise when he partners with Sydney Prosser (cool smoky-eyed Amy Adams) a New Mexico transplant savvy enough to know that an English accent a phony title and a strategic deployment of leg and cleavage can hook bigger fish. Meanwhile Irvings being played like an accordion by his nut-log wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence living up to her sassy over-revved characters description as ""the Picasso of passive-aggressive karate""). Ambitious naive FBI man Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) snares Sydney in a sting and pressures her to recruit Irving for a high-profile case. Richie hoping to make Watergate-style headlines wants to nail a slew of top politicians. Irving arranges a deception involving a fake sheik and briefcases full of 100 bills. The first domino in line is Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) the beloved mayor of Camden N.J. Polito wants to get north Jersey back on its feet with oceanside casinos and understands that a little seed money is necessary for such enterprises. The good news is that Renner a straight arrow who truly wants prosperity for his downtrodden constituents is willing to facilitate a little honest graft. The bad news is that Bale impressed by Renners integrity and guileless friendship doesnt want to double-cross him. AMERICAN HUSTLE  out of 4 stars Rating R for pervasive language some sexual content brief violence. In English and subtitled Arabic. The entrapment scheme is just one element in a marathon of chicanery. Half the characters are trying to seduce the other half with influence or money or sex. Every time the cast is reshuffled in a new scene the con games start over. Everyone begins every encounter looking for an edge trying to out-think out-negotiate out-maneuver and generally upset the competitions apple carts. Innocent bystanders are swept up in the craziness. Louis C.K. has a splendid bit part as Coopers FBI boss frazzled by his underlings ever-escalating demands for private jets multimillion-dollar wire transfers and enormous hotel suites. The comedically convoluted arguments skid around out of control until theyre so much pointless noise. And writer/director David O. Russell has a live-wire dream cast that can make nonstop conflict consistently entertaining. The women are every bit the mens equals strong independent masters of one-up-womanship. The faux-aristocratic Adams occupies every scene like a throne while Lawrence pelts her fellow players with boomerangs and bombshells firing off zingers with a rattlesnake lunge of her head. They complete their co-stars. Cooper falls for Adams Lawrence browbeats Bale both guys are spineless cheats and neither woman knows what she wants. ""American Hustle"" is a screwball romance about the love of power. The stability of conventional marriage is out of the question and the most anyone hopes for is a temporary collaborative partnership and a big score.

In both ""American Hustle"" and ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" wily characters reveal that a secret of sales is saying no to your customers until they beg you to take their money. So if certain hipsters imply that ""American Hustle"" is too smart and satirical for mainstream moviegoers its just a ploy to make you rush to the theater to see one of the best films of the year.And while youre at the mallplex perhaps you might be interested in some vintage fashions weve reserved for discerning buyers.As much as anything the wildly entertaining 70s flashback ""American Hustle"" is a triumph of style. It is not however what dismissive snobs would call "" a triumph of style over substance"" because the loud clothes and cars are helping to tell a true story that starts with the characters. Irving Rosenfeld (the chameleonic Christian Bale) is a midlevel trickster who uses his New York dry-cleaning establishments as fronts for phony investments and fine-arts scams. Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) is a social-striving staffer at Cosmopolitan magazine who dons an English accent and boob-baring apparel to ride in the fast lane with Irving.Left at the side of the road is Irvings needy noodgy young wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence). And working the radar gun is FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) who initially busts the grifters and then enlists them in a complicated scheme to entrap politicians selling gambling rights in Atlantic City with a phony Arab sheik (Michael Pena) as the bait.Unlike the usual Hollywood hack making a movie about corruption director David O. Russell lets his characters surprise us -- and themselves. Poorly paid Richie who is seduced by Sydneys accent and manners is as much a casualty of the hustle as the more-or-less-honest mayor of impoverished Camden N.J. Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner). It would be hard to imagine a better cast of contemporary actors than this one which combines the stars of Russells films ""The Fighter"" and ""Silver Linings Playbook."" What hair-splitter could pick a favorite between Coopers lovestruck fed Lawrences big-mouthed bimbo Bales comb-over king and Adams cleavage queen?And as a mobster rejuvenated Robert De Niro reminds us that hes a better actor than that no-goodnik from ""The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle."" The word on the street is that several of these actors will get private meetings with Oscar.With a solid-gold cast and a sterling script ""American Hustle"" has a higher return on investment than any other movie in the marketplace.What ""American Hustle""  Four stars out of four  Rating R  Run time 218  Content Pervasive language sexual content and brief violence Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

Russell reaches his dizziest heights when he tinkers with classical Hollywood genres most recently the melodrama (The Fighter) and the screwball comedy (Silver Linings Playbook). In the delirious new American Hustle he folds his favorite conventions into the ultimate caper yarn. He seems to be having obscene amounts of fun which becomes contagious very quickly.""Some of this actually happened."" Etched on the screen at the movies start these words provide both a statement of fact and a mischievous stick in the side of anyone who demands nothing but facts from movies based on reality. Coloring outside the lines of the 1970s Abscam scandal Russell and co-writer Eric Singer have extracted a headlong dive into love loyalty and the long con featuring a pudgy (and quite likable) Christian Bale and the loopy ladies in his life (Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence).Bale plays Irving Rosenfeld a Bronx-born hustler with an epic comb-over that requires a fair amount of glue. Irvings passion his raison detre is the separation of marks from their money. He meets an enthusiastic partner (Adams); their schemes draw an even more enthusiastic FBI agent (Bradley Cooper) who wants to parlay the couple into the case of a lifetime.Russell loves characters who operate on the line between chaos and control a boundary that also applies to his movies madcap energy. Team Irving has a plan which includes a fake Arab sheik (actually a Mexican from Arizona played by Michael Pena) and the popular mayor of Camden N.J. (Jeremy Renner). Trouble is the plan cant keep up with reality which has a nasty habit of shifting and evolving beneath the perpetrators feet. Half the fun of American Hustle lies in trying to figure out whos playing whom.And at least a third of the fun is in the hair. Besides Bales follicular masterpiece theres Coopers curl job (and curlers) Renners pompadour and Adams ever-changing tresses. The real the fake and the many gradations in between lie at the heart of American Hustle.Irving even makes a healthy side living dealing in forged art. But he gets shaken up by his genuine feelings not so much for his wife (Lawrence an instant comic adrenaline blast) or his mistress but for his friend the mayor a sucker with a decent heart.With all the scurrying about and verbal jujitsu it can be hard to locate American Hustles center of gravity. The mind wanders to peripheral questions such as How much did the producers have to fork over for music rights on this thing? Is that Jeff Lynne? (Yes it is with two different songs.) Do any other movies use Steely Dans ""Dirty Work""? Russells soundtracks runneth over with nuggets and to his credit they usually fit the story and the mood.American Hustle doesnt add up to anything too complicated but its topsy-turvy rhythms and committed performances are addictive. This is a very funny movie about people behaving badly -- a tradition as old as any of Russells favorites.Follow Chris Vognar on Twitter at chrisvognar.AMERICAN HUSTLE (A-)Directed by David O.

Comments (2) click to enlarge American Hustle Recommended Video Rated R  138 minutes  2013 David O. Russells fictionalized drama about Abscam the FBI sting operation that nailed more than a half dozen U.S. legislators on bribery and conspiracy charges made me nostalgic for the 70s--not for all the bad hair splayed collars gold chains and plunging necklines but for an era when grown-up movies like this one came out almost every week. Scripted by Eric Warren Singer (The International) and given a comic punch-up by Russell it centers on two con-artists-in-love (Christian Bale and Amy Adams) who are sucked into the operation by a dodgy FBI agent (Bradley Cooper) and forced to entrap the beloved mayor of Camden New Jersey (Jeremy Renner). Filled with rich characters and sharp dialogue the movie turns on questions of friendship and fidelity both personal and political with a knockout performance by Jennifer Lawrence as the con mans jealous ball-busting wife.

"American Hustle (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review American Hustle (R) Director David O. Russells smashing comedy about con artists and the complicated games they play. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com12/19/2013 Editor rating 3.5 Everyone in American Hustle is lying and scheming and conning and plotting Whenever someone stops to actually tell the truth disaster almost always follows. This is a lively genial comedy about hucksterism as the American dream -- about people doing what they want and going after what they want and sorry if you happen to be in their way. Director David O. Russell (The Fighter The Silver Linings Playbook) who co-wrote the script with Eric Warren Singer uses the 1970s Abscam scandal which resulted in the convictions of 19 politicians as a very loose springboard for his own merry tale of an FBI sting operation gone wrong. The movie opens with the title card ""Some of this actually happened"" letting you know from the start the film is not intended as a history lesson. Nor should it be taken very seriously. Russells loosest most playful film to date American Hustle is an unexpectedly funny take on a serious subject told through the eyes of five protagonists. Irving (Christian Bale) is a pot-bellied scammer with an elaborate combover who supplements his income from his laundromat by selling stolen paintings on the black market and fleecing desperate businessmen with fake investment opportunities. Sydney (Amy Adams) is his partner in crime a shrewd businesswoman who adopts a fake British accent passes herself off as royalty to gain their targets trust and uses her beauty as a sleight-of-hand distraction (every dress she owns seems designed to show off her cleavage). Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) is Irvings unhappy wife a shrill and demanding woman who refuses to grant him a divorce (he legally adopted her son) and is prone to setting their home on fire by accident. Shes the loose cannon who is capable of bringing down the whole operation. Richie (Bradley Cooper) is an FBI agent chasing after grandeur and fame After he busts Irving and Sydney during one of their small-time scams he forces them to cooperate with him and go after bigger fish or else get sent to prison. And Carmine (Jeremy Renner) is the New Jersey mayor who is trying to do the best for his constituents by turning Atlantic City into a gambling paradise. Hes not corrupt -- he really is a man of the people -- but he unwittingly gets snared in an increasingly complicated sting that grows to involve senators congressmen and most alarmingly (and dangerously) the mob. Russell lays out the intricacies of the covert operation cleanly and clearly but its the characters not the sting that interest him the most. Every performance in American Hustle is one to relish Theyre the reason the movie will endure. Bale too often cast as brooding tortured men is terrific as Irving who quietly suffers his wifes indignities is often in a state of quiet exasperation (watch how hes constantly fiddling with his aviator glasses) and is frightened by the way the sting operation keeps growing. Hes not a violent man he has an aversion to danger and hes not interested in going after big shots. Hes content feeding off little fish. Adams exudes brains and sex appeal as Bales partner and potential soulmate She admits she doesnt understand why shes attracted to him but she falls for him hard and when he refuses to leave his wife for the sake of his son it breaks her heart. Coopers vain hot-tempered FBI agent who isnt above beating up his boss (a hilarious Louis CK) to get what he needs becomes the movies de facto villain in a story where he should be the hero. His greed and aggressiveness are off-putting and hes so blinded by the potential career boost that awaits him if he pulls off the operation hes too distracted to realize when he too is being conned. Renner is sweet and earnest as the well-meaning but oblivious mayor -- a likable stooge in a movie filled with sharks. And Lawrence continues to surprise as Irvings shouty needy wife whose constant anger and frustration mask a deep loneliness and depression. She seems to intentionally wreak havoc just to get her husbands attention (when he brings home a new device known as a microwave which they call a ""science oven"" he warns her not to put any metal inside; the first thing she does is pop in a dish covered in aluminum foil). American Hustle carries a distinct Scorsese vibe from its use of voiceover narration from multiple characters -- which gives you different points of view on the same situation -- to Russells plentiful use of period pop songs on the soundtrack (the way he conveys the quiet menace of high-ranking mobsters smacks strongly of Goodfellas). But Russell uses music differently allowing certain songs to drown out the dialogue in some scenes to make us feel  the characters inner states of mind. Donna Summers I Feel Love conveys the uptight Richies much-needed loosening-up It allows the tightly wound agent a brief respite of sheer abandon. Elton Johns Goodbye Yellow Brick Road is beautifully used to depict the myriad relationships among the main characters the first time they are all together each of them playing a facade but aware of the truth. And Paul McCartney amp; Wings Live and Let Die is the soundtrack for Rosalyns furious payback for her husbands adultery (and also the accompaniment for some amusingly angry bit of house cleaning). Russell has great fun decking out his characters in garish 70s clothes and hairdos (if there was an Oscar category for Best Hairstyling American Hustle would be a shoo-in) and he places his camera entirely at the service of his actors eschewing show-off style for close-ups and zooms that highlight the performances of his ensemble cast. Best of all the movie pulls a massive con on the audience that you wont see coming no matter how hard you look (on second viewing youll realize the film gives you loads of subtle clues). American Hustle is fizzy and glitzy but not in a carnivalesque Boogie Nights-way Russells films are more grounded in reality than Hollywood glitter-parties. He just knows how to make the real world feel just a little more heightened than it really is. Like his con artists are prone to saying American Hustle works from the feet up and the fun is intoxicating.

Photo Francois Duhamel Sony Pictures American Hustle review Right-on take on the 70s 1 / 5 Back to Gallery American Hustle Comedy-drama. Starring Christian Bale Amy Adams Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence. Directed by David O. Russell. (R. 138 minutes.) The first thing we see in ""American Hustle"" is Christian Bale putting together his hair. He plays someone completely bald on top but with long hair on the sides and with the aid of some glue a forlorn hairpiece and a comb-over he arranges himself in the mirror and goes out to face the world. Its an arresting and strange opening for director David O. Russells exuberant new film - arresting because theres no taking your eyes off of Bale who looks awful having gained 50 pounds for the role. (He gained the weight not because he had to but because thats just the kind of thing he does.) And its strange because the spectacle leads an entire audience to temporarily disrespect the guy when in fact hes our hero. Even that hair is worthy of respect. Here is a resourceful individual who will do whatever he needs to do including cultivating an illusion of hair in that distinctly hair-loving era of the late 1970s. ""American Hustle"" is loosely based on the Abscam scandal which was crazy enough even before Russell and co-screenwriter Eric Singer got hold of it. A sting operation by the FBI in which various political officeholders were offered bribes on behalf of a (fake) Arab sheikh it led to multiple convictions as well as to charges that the FBI unfairly entrapped people. The film changes names and motivations adds characters and alters relationships but one thing is true - the FBI really did hire a professional con man to put over the scam. Here thats Irving (Bale) a man from the Bronx streets (Bales accent is perfection). His partner is his girlfriend Sydney (Amy Adams) who hides her own hardscrabble background behind a posh English accent. Both are driven by a need to reinvent themselves as something splendid and glamorous which makes them quintessentially American dreamers not just hustlers. ""American Hustle"" is Russells best film one that finds him in that ideal zone of spontaneity and complete control. He employs voice-over narration then drops it when he doesnt need it anymore. He dresses Bradley Cooper as an ambitious FBI agent in home-permed hair and garish 70s fashions and he gives him the freedom to act just as high-strung here as he did playing a manic-depressive in ""The Silver Linings Playbook."" Much is extreme and yet in keeping with an era of vulgarity and bacchanalian excess. As Coopers much-abused boss Louis C.K. is the focus of some very funny scenes. Yet the comedy doesnt inhibit Russell from dropping into an ominous mood when necessary as when the FBI agent starts casting to land a Mafia boss. Robert De Niro plays the boss as a no-nonsense old murderer and hes threatening enough just sitting there talking so as to hover over the rest of the movie like a poison cloud. Russell (""Three Kings"" ""The Fighter"") has always had a talent for harmonizing tragedy and comedy seriousness and outlandishness all within a precise tone that allows for a wide range of emotions and effects. But his hand has never been more sure. Jennifer Lawrence as Irvings young wife embodies the movies tonal range. She is funny and alarming often at the same time. Rosalyn who tricked Irving into a marriage he cant escape is a complete idiot who thinks shes brilliant and a monster of selfishness who thinks shes giving. Lawrences performance lets us see the twists and turns of her thought processes even as she masters an Eastern dialect and an outsize floozy manner thats the antithesis of her usual screen self. Shes remarkable. But its Adams and Bale who are the films heart and soul the honorable crooks in a sea of piranhas the movies truthful core around which all the madness revolves. Adams who goes through the movie almost flopping out of her low-cut 70s gowns and blouses is especially poignant playing an intelligent person with the least power and the most at stake. Its fascinating watching her think her way through as she does the most with a bad hand. And Bale brings great suppressed feeling to his scenes with a goodhearted New Jersey mayor (Jeremy Renner) whose life Irving is being forced to wreck. The re-creation of the 1970s will please everyone who was there and instruct everyone who wasnt. Yes it was crass. Yet the 70s were like the 1920s in that years later you can take one look and know the decade and it wasnt all ugly. The disco scene in particular is like a time travel with not just the clothes and the lights done right but also the choreography which re-creates what youd normally see on a Saturday night people dancing in a line with all the guys doing the same move over and over revolving their two fists in a circle and then clapping their hands.

"American Hustle 4.5 stars Article Comments () Things to do >> Movies >> Article American Hustle 4.5 stars American Hustle a relentlessly entertaining movie SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Tue Dec 17 2013 210 PM ""American Hustle"" opens with an unrecognizable Christian Bale balding and looking like he has swallowed a beach ball meticulously working a pathetic comb-over. Its hilarious and sad and especially entertaining. David O. Russells movie never lets up from there. Boasting terrific acting a brilliant soundtrack outrageous outfits and hair and a kinda-sorta based-on-fact story of ambition and greed its relentless in the best possible way. This sounds like one of those silly blurbs you see plastered on DVD boxes but this really is the most-fun movie of the year. Russell co-wrote the story with Eric Singer and they based it loosely on Abscam the FBI sting of the late 1970s that snared a U.S. senator along with a few congressional representatives. Theyve created characters to tell the story which is perfectly acceptable because the movie isnt about politics but about human nature. Bale plays Irving Rosenfeld a con man who offers desperate people loans he has no intention of providing. Hes assisted in this by his lover Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) a former stripper from New Mexico who has reinvented herself sort of as Lady Edith some sort of English noblewoman with supposed ties to London banking. (Those ties are of course as phony as Rosenfelds hair.) They get caught early on by Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) a vain cocaine-fueled FBI agent whose ambition outstrips his intelligence by a fair amount. He offers Rosenfeld and Lady Edith (he doesnt know her real background) a deal Help him catch even bigger prey and they can go free. Of course asking con artists to help you con people is fraught with risks but DiMaso is too eager to impress his long-suffering boss (Louis C.K.) to think things through all the time. Things are messy to begin with but they get worse. Rosenfeld as it happens is married to the brassy brazen Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) whose habit of listening on the other line to his phone conversations proves troublesome. Then there is Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) the mayor of Camden who is a key target of Rosenfelds scam which involves fake Arab sheiks and money to build casinos. Polito mobbed up though he may be genuinely seems to want to provide opportunity for his constituents even if that opportunity is illegal. Rosenfeld feels for him goes to dinner with him becomes friends with him. Its all a swirl of deep-plunging necklines and ill-suited perms drugs and dancing and the chance to make something more of yourself. A twisted version of the American dream you might say. All the actors are fantastic all going places we havent seen them go before and given the talent involved thats saying something. Cooper is perfect as the nervy DiMaso right down to the tiny rollers he puts in his hair for maximum tackiness. Renner manages to help us find empathy with Polito lost in the swirl of con after con. Adams shows a ferocity hinted at in ""The Master"" but given full bloom here. Shes determined to change her life at any cost; she uses her sexuality as a tool playing Rosenfeld and playing DiMaso. Or is she? Not knowing is part of the fun. Lawrence is great giving Rosalyn a depth that surprises. Rosalyn is a loud-mouthed uncouth drunk but no less ambitious than the rest of this crowd. Its just that like them she doesnt always go about realizing that ambition in the smartest way. Outstanding as they all are Bale is better and better than hes ever been. Its not just the physical transformation a trick he has pulled before in the opposite direction (losing a scary amount of weight for ""The Machinist""). Its how he makes Rosenfeld and his ability to take advantage of other peoples weaknesses somehow sympathetic. He rips off people for a living but he has his own twisted code of ethics. And hes a lot smarter than he seems. Throw in songs like ""10538 Overture"" by the Electric Light Orchestra which is used to perfection not once but twice and we find Russell at the top of his game along with everyone else in the movie. It may not be the most serious examination of greed and the American psyche ever made but it is surely the most entertaining. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Russell returns with his best picture to date By Rex Reed  12/13/13 1000am Left to right Amy Adams Bradley Cooper Jeremy Renner Christian Bale and Jennifer Lawrence in American Hustle. Were all con artists see. Everyone is conning someone else in order to survive. Thats the cockeyed theme of American Hustle a crazy classy mess of a movie that shifts tempos every 10 minutes leaving you breathless. Marveling at a quintet of throbbing star performances and trying to keep up with the elaborate plot twists (inspired by the real-life Abscam political scandal) that come at you in sections will make you feel like your attention span is on speed dial. You wont doze in this one. Im not a devoted fan of director David O. Russell. I hated Three Kings and consider I Heart Huckabees one of the worst movies ever made. Things improved with The Fighter and last years Silver Linings Playbook but American Hustle which he also wrote (with Eric Warren Singer) is flawed but so clever you cant ignore its obvious entertainment value. The fun starts early with camera-ready hunk Christian Bale unbelievably miscast but unforgettable as a fat balding and decidedly decimated out-of-shape New Jersey scam artist named Irving Rosenfeld standing in front of a mirror pasting tufts of phony hair into a hilarious comb-over. Hes an ugly flim-flam artist who started as a kid breaking the store windows in his Bronx neighborhood to drum up customers for his fathers failing glass business. Now hes immersed in a dry cleaning business as a front for money laundering. His partner in crime is girlfriend Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) a Cosmopolitan magazine secretary whose promising bra size over-shadowed her assets at shorthand elevating her career to stripping. Broke fearless and addicted to self-delusion she reinvents herself by adopting a British accent and a fake I.D. to join Irving as a sexy partner in bed and business and keep herself up to date in a never-ending assortment of wigs cosmetics and lingerie. Together they show a small profit devoted to the philosophy ""Were all conning ourselves in one way or another--just to get through life."" The only thing that prevents them from making their partnership legal is Irvings fizzy gum-chewing bimbo wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence with piles of peroxided curls on top of her pointed head). Enter Bradley Cooper as Richie an FBI agent with a terrible Toni home permanent who specializes in white-collar crime. Richie busts Irving and Sydney for embezzlement then saves them from prison by recruiting them into a new line of work conning crooked politicians in Congress. The scheme involves a wire operator at the F.B.I. the U.S. prosecutor (Alessandro Nivola) and the mayor of Atlantic City (Jeremy Renner wearing a pudding of hair on the top of his head that looks like Donald Trumps) who plans to rebuild the Jersey shore with building permits and new casino licenses. The F.B.I. provides the money in the name of a bogus sheik (a con man from Mexico named Paco) to nail the mayor in the act of taking a bribe. Richie is hustling the mayor Irving and Sydney are hustling them both and Rosalyns dumb bottle blonde with 3-D cleavage is hustling them all without even knowing it. They finally all come face to face with a mobster from Florida who is Meyer Lanskys right-hand man (Robert DeNiro in a guest appearance) who pulls the biggest hustle of them all while bullets fly. So does credibility but never mind. This is strictly for laughs Damon Runyon-style. American Hustle is an essay on the brilliance of corruption. The wire taps bribes intimidations double-crosses traps and internecine cons finally get too confusing to stay up with but everyone is brimming with duplicity and they all have hairdos worthy of lawsuits. But its a goofy fascinating look at people who live on larceny with a ridiculous sense of fashion and felony featuring a fabulous soundtrack that opens with Duke Ellingtons swinging big band recording of ""Jeeps Blues"" and runs the gamut from Oscar Peterson Ella Fitzgerald and Thelonious Monk to Debussy and Elton John. The film moves like a jam session with freewheeling solos and collaborative riffs and a uniformly wonderful ensemble cast that walks a tightrope and keeps you guessing. I wouldnt call American Hustle my kind of movie but perversely I have to admit I enjoyed it primarily because of the twisted logic and wicked cleverness. Its a tangled mass of loosely connected extension cords constantly in need of plugging back in before they blow a fuse. AMERICAN HUSTLE WRITTEN BY Eric Singer and David O.

Let yourself go man. The best way to walk into a movie is with a blank head. Forget what youve read or heard. Make up your own mind. I didnt care for Silver Linings Playbook one bit and thought The Fighter was just okay. I was leery about American Hustle but came away from it thinking it was a great American film that would be remembered for decades to come. Good luck in your future moviegoing endeavors James S.said on Tuesday February 11 2014 75946 PMA great film--one whose greatness is easily overlooked I think. I would have put it in the top spot on my list of the years best but that damned Upstream Color kept getting in the way for reasons I still cant explain Joshsaid on Saturday January 11 2014 95815 PMTony I agree. Brilliant performances all around wonderful story and many scenes that stick with you long after viewing are only held back by the flow which does seem to rob the film of its momentum at times. However its so good when the momentum is flowing that the lagging spots are pretty easily forgotten and forgiven. Travis Starrsaid on Tuesday January 07 2014 33408 AMAmerican Hustle was a huge mess of storytelling What do you get when you mix Quentin Tarantino Paul Thomas Anderson Wes Anderson and Martin Scorsese all together but with no pulse amongst a confusing/messy story with some great acting some wacky hair and a lot of side boob? You get David O. Russels America Hustle. Its Jackie Brown meets Boogie Nights with directors Wes Anderson and the great Martin Scorsese style through into the mix. Only Russells film is all style with a lot of confusion. Russells proves he can direct in a similar fashion to Tarantino P.T. Wes and Scorsese only his film has no control over its structure. Russells Scorsese check off list goes Awesome soundtrack songs camera zooms and pans a great cast stylish to the time period but somewhere in there Russell did not learn how to properly tell a great story here. He did with Three Kings which was his last ""great"" film. What a mess of a con film. Christian Bale was fantastic Amy Adams was great Jeremy Renner was amazing and Jennifer Lawrence was stunning. Bradley Cooper was none of these. He was Bradley Cooper playing Bradley Cooper you know the guy from The Hangover who looks like hes always doing drugs off camera. Just saying. For about a solid hour I had no clue what this film was really about. I knew a big con was put in place but its never simply laid out for the audience as to what theyre plan is even though its a con film with twists in the beginning the plan is always well explained. Not here. American Hustle spends more time caring about its looks its acting its zoom ins and zoom outs and camera pans than the films own structure and story. A script with too many open gaps in between scenes and dialogue. Also the pacing of the film was intolerable the sudden pauses and cut aways from one characters lines to another made this film impossible to flow together with its own dialogue. It works in scenes like Bradley Cooper asking his boss in the hallway to finish the rest of his ice fishing story (which was the biggest laugh in the film) but in scenes where Bale Cooper and Adams argue before the big con these breath gaps are all over and slow the scenes to the speed of turtle. I get it everyone hustles others to survive. But in a story this big and this big of a cast I should not be spending an hour and a half trying to figure out which character Im suppose to be caring about Most of the characters of the film are idiots like in Pulp Fiction which is great for a dark comedy. However where as the characters of Pulp Fiction had great and interesting brainless topics to talk about these characters have the most uninteresting dialogue and topics to talk about most of the time. Except for the ice fishing story. In the end this film based on ""So me of these things are real"" doesnt make for an easy good 2 hour plus sit through. The best way to describe American Hustle is like the wedding scene in the film classic Goodfellas where Karen meets 2 dozens Peters and Pauls who are all married to girls named Marie. ""By the time I was finished I thought I was drunk"". Tonysaid on Thursday January 02 2014 22256 AMGreat movie in regards to the performances and settings. The only drawback I found was the flow of the movie where I did find it lacking in sustaining its momentum. Am I the only one? Timsaid on Saturday December 28 2013 63238 PMI walked out of this movie after 40 minutes.It is slow and very boring with 0 humor.Save your money or go see the wolf of wall street it is the best movie in a long time. David said on Saturday December 28 2013 40405 AMI have to say I was a little disappointed with this one. The performances were terrific all around and it was well made however I found the film as a whole to be non-compelling. I give credit to David O. Russell for realizing the absurdity of this whole thing and running with it; he does create a few memorable scenes but by the end i wasnt fully invested enough to care which was a real shame. Wanted to love it wish I loved it but cant. Agree to disagree on this one Richard. Grade B-. Stevesaid on Thursday December 26 2013 103147 PMIve been going to movies for my entire 49 year life. This is only the 3rd one ever--out of easily more than a 1000--that I thought about walking out of. It was terrible. Absolutely terrible. Not a single character that mattered to me. Contrived and way over the top. It even had the cliche disco scene Golden Globe Nomination for Best Picture? Sad. Dillsaid on Thursday December 26 2013 72737 PMIt ranks right up there with The Sting Dirty Rotten Scoundrels and Matchstick Men in this genre. Allisonsaid on Monday December 23 2013 123651 AMThis movie was hilarious first and foremost. But its much more than that. The acting was fantastic even from unexpected small characters. Its a fascinating take on con men. The script is excellent and unlike Silver Linings Playbook when it goes for depth it delivers. It asks interesting questions about identity and how far people are willing to go to change and how much people are willing to lie to themselves. And it answers to the last quite a lot. If you watch the movie youll see. Even you will get conned. Comments 1 - 10 of 13 1 2 | Next 3   Page 1 of 2 POST A COMMENT indicates required fieldName Email Website YouTubeResponse URL  ?

"American Hustle movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Review American Hustle David O. Russells Abscam lark populated by unforgettable charactersDecember 17 2013|Michael PhillipsAmy Adams from left Bradley Cooper Jeremy Renner Christian Bale and Jennifer Lawrence star in ""American Hustle."" (Handout)My favorite minute of movie this year comes early in David O. Russells ""American Hustle."" Christian Bales character the con man Irving Rosenfeld based on the real-life Abscam linchpin Mel Weinberg is riding high His small-time investment scams conducted with his wily mistress (played by Amy Adams) keep growing more profitable and theyre falling in love. Backed by the great Broadway finger-snapper ""Ive Got Your Number"" Bale and Adams dance their way across a Manhattan intersection and after a perfect cut into a hotel ballroom where vocalist Jack Jones and a jazz combo are swinging. So few directors today know how to move a camera around; Russell is one of them. The whole movie a feast of ensemble wiles and stunning hair is juicy funny and alive.It sets its tone of blithe truthiness at the beginning as the words flash on screen ""Some of this actually happened."" Coming off ""The Fighter"" and ""Silver Linings Playbook"" director and co-writer Russell treats the 1970s Abscam sting operation and the schlump at its center as a pivot point for a spacious ensemble comedy -- tone-funny and atmosphere-funny not punch line-funny. Abscam was the FBIs post-Watergate feel-good project resulting in convictions of a U.S. senator members of the U.S. House of Representatives and a slew of influence peddlers. ""American Hustle"" cares little for sorting out the particulars of Abscam. No model of narrative form the film zigs and zags chasing after many different characters. And that sprawl the rogues gallery of strays cheaters and deceivers activates the film rather than deflates it.The Abscam morass which I could barely track (Im an idiot) even on a second viewing takes a back seat to the machinations of the characters played by Bale and Adams and by Bradley Cooper who co-stars as an egotistical FBI agent who nabs Rosenfeld and then goes into the entrapment business with him while falling for his colleague.The triangle is really a quadrangle; Jennifer Lawrence is formidably unpredictably volatile as Rosenfelds wife an unreliable mess with a preteen son. ""I thought you were mysterious like my mother"" Rosenfeld complains breathlessly in their first scene together. ""Until it turned it out mysterious meant depressed hard to reach"" Nobodys satisfied for long in ""American Hustle"" which carried a more direct and family-unfriendly word in its title back when screenwriter Eric Warren Singers script was making the rounds in Hollywood. (He retains primary screen credit.)As Rosenfeld juggles his two lives and two women he and Richie DiMaso (Cooper) bait the hook to nab among other midlevel politicians the back-slapping casino-backing mayor of Camden N.J. portrayed as a sympathetic scapegoat by Jeremy Renner. Abscam was an entrapment dilly though many -- including Russell -- question the lengths to which the FBI went in order to catch a few governmental payroll hands in a few cookie jars. These are not especially glamorous figures though theyre all stars in their own minds and by their own careful presentation. Bale is introduced at the mirror in a room at the Plaza in 1978 fastidiously applying a toupee to one of the 20th centurys epic comb overs.At one point Rosenfeld and DiMaso (whos constantly arguing budgets with his hapless overseer played by Louis C.K.) set up a meeting between an aging Sam Giancana type interested in Atlantic City gaming prospects and a fake Arab sheik the alleged backer. A near-mute Michael Pena plays the sheik whos really a Mexican-American FBI agent posing as an Arab. Robert De Niro plays the mobster and when the miniscam threatens to fall apart and turn violent ""American Hustle"" in turn threatens with sly effectiveness to turn into a very different movie. Its a testament to Russells way with actors Just when you think you never want to see De Niro play another mobster he comes through with understated impact.Some I suspect will be frustrated by the movies disinterest in jacking up the suspense artificially throughout. ""American Hustle"" takes it easy. The coda feels soft and the picture probably to a fault is forgiving toward Rosenfeld who remains somewhat opaque. Bales characterization is impressive in its externals -- the gained weight the hunchy posture -- but sometimes lacking in interpretive ease. Then again this is a guy who lies and steals for his supper. He lives in a state of justifiable paranoia.So much has been made already of ""American Hustles"" surface resemblance to Martin Scorseses ""GoodFellas"" but Russell absorbs certain visual and musical influences from Scorsese while going his own merry way. The soundtrack covers everything from Duke Ellington to ""A Horse With No Name""; cinematographer Linus Sandgren displays an unerring knack for slightly rancid 70s chic. The actors strut through it all with supreme confidence. But as the lyric from ""Ive Got Your Number"" indicates its the false fronts and neuroses and insecurities that keep these peacocks interesting and make ""American Hustle"" one of the years slyest entertainments.mjphillipstribune.com ""American Hustle"" - 4 starsMPAA rating R (for pervasive language some sexual content and brief violence)Running time 218Opens Friday MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesJennifer Lawrence Targets Different Audiences as She...October 3 2013American Hustle Gravity lead Oscar nominations with 10...January 16 2014American Hustle wins top prize at Screen Actors Guild...January 18 2014American Hustle hauls in Hollywood actors top prizeJanuary 18 2014American Hustle Wins SAG Ensemble Cast AwardJanuary 18 2014Find More Stories AboutChristian BaleJennifer LawrenceAmy AdamsEntrapmentTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/chi-american-hustle-1220-20131217,0,1196852.column",200,americanhustle18,americanhustle,chicagotribune
"American Hustle | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; american-hustle ) American Hustle (United States 2013) December 17 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli By cannibalizing the casts of his previous two movies director David O. Russell has come up with his third consecutive winner. American Hustle very loosely based on late 1970s ""ABSCAM"" sting takes its cues from Boogie Nights both in terms of how it uses music and in the way it recreates the era. The film is also darkly funny and although the background is a scandal that headlined news reports across the world Russell never loses focus on the small group of characters at the center of his story. American Hustle is all about cons small-time operations by under-the-radar crooks government-sponsored scams and twists where David bamboozles Goliath. The characters in the film are almost never themselves - theyre in disguise teasing elaborately groomed hair using fake accents donning someone elses clothing or concocting fantasies in which theyre the central figure. Yet in spite of the subject matters seediness (ABSCAM resulted in the corruption convictions of a U.S. senator six members of the House of Representatives and several lesser politicians) Russells script is laced with wit. Events transpire primarily in the late 1970s before advances in technology and global awareness would make this sort of elaborate FBI-sponsored swindle impractical. American Hustle begins by introducing viewers to Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) and Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) two lovers who make money by preying on the greed of their clients. Eventually they become big enough to attract notice and are caught in the net of agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper). But Richie doesnt want to put Irving and Sydney in jail - he wants to use them to help him climb the FBIs corporate ladder by capturing some big fish - Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) the mayor of Camden New Jersey; congressmen; and maybe even some mobsters. Without recourse Irving and Sydney go along with the scheme. While it unfolds Sydney is pulled out of Irvings orbit and into Richies and Irving finds his ambitions curtailed by the actions of his ditzy wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence). Narratively the first half of American Hustle has a rambling unfocused approach as it incorporates flashbacks voiceover narratives and other storytelling devices to introduce the characters bring them together and get things moving in a straightforward trajectory. The movies closing act is the most conventional part of Russells tale in that it unfolds in a manner that will be familiar to connoisseurs of heist and con films. Theres a little flavor of The Sting here although the 70s Oscar winner was breezier and more upbeat than American Hustle. Taking a page out of Paul Thomas Andersons playbook Russell uses era-appropriate pop tunes to establish the setting and provide jolts of energy to certain scenes. With a soundtrack that easily incorporates a dozen instantly recognizable 70s songs American Hustle rolls from one theme to another using the music to enhance scenes. One of the best films to use this technique in the past 20 years is Boogie Nights and although American Hustle isnt quite on that level it deserves consideration as a runner up. Russell brings back Christian Bale and Amy Adams from The Fighter and Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence from Silver Linings Playbook. Although the ensemble dream cast features five Oscar nominees (two winners - Lawrence and Bale) there are no standout performances. Bale as is his style gives his all to the project having gained considerable weight to play the pot-bellied balding Irving. Although none of the characters in American Hustle are easy to like Bales is the most sympathetic (or maybe merely ""pathetic""). Amy Adams is at her sultry best showing more cleavage than in any previous outing - you gotta love that late-70s fashion. Bradley Cooper is occasionally overshadowed by his tightly curled hair and Jennifer Lawrence (despite sweeping through various early critics awards) doesnt have much of substance to do. She has a couple of great scenes and the rest of the time shes playing a cartoon. With American Hustle Russell employs a fascinating inversion. The normal attitude of a movie about bribed government officials is one of sneering disdain. In this case however Russell makes the ""corrupt"" politicians laudable - they take the money not to line their pockets but to create and promote jobs for the citizens of New Jersey. And the way the FBI runs the sting isnt the clean streamlined well-planned operation one might expect. Russell has fun with all this. American Hustle runs a little long with the strongest scenes occurring toward the end. Although the actors dont put on a clinic they all provide worthwhile performances playing interesting characters and theres a nice cameo thrown into the mix. Russells name and his surehandedness helming the material could make American Hustle more of an Oscar contender than it might otherwise be. Its an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours but doesnt stand alongside some of 2013s best films. American Hustle (United States 2013) Director David O.

The Fighter and Silver Linings Playbook played as exciting experiments to see just how much of Russells clattering chaotic creative sensibility could survive the Hollywood formulae of the boxing movie and romcom respectively. A lot it turns out and American Hustle his whirling wilful take on the con caper is no different; with much of its sensational ensemble drawn from Russells two previous films its a loose trilogy-capper.Loose is the operative word throughout. Some of this actually happened quips an introductory title card as the film launches into a fictionalised digressive account of the FBIs notorious Abscam sting of the late 1970s. The plot in which Christian Bales dopey New Jersey dry-cleaner moonlighting as an art forger Irving Rosenfeld is coerced by sleazy federal agent Richie DiMaso (a poodle-permed Bradley Cooper) into a plot to bring down several high-ranking politicians is certainly knotty enough. But ultimately story is secondary to Russells delicious detailing of character and milieu. A brilliant wordless opening scene in which Bale applies a vole-like toupee to his bald pate with heartbreaking care sets the tone for a film as much about personal disguises as professional ones.  Its also a love story oddly affecting in its cold-heartedness between two falsely confident tricksters Rosenfeld is alternately wooed and wound up by slippery Sydney (a fierce Amy Adams) as his garish Jersey-girl wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) watches from the sidelines. Wounded but powerfully deranged belting out Live and Let Die in her literally gilded suburban cage Lawrence is entirely extraordinary here improving on the performance that won her an Oscar for Russells last film. Long may this collaboration continue in her hes found the ideal firestarter for his brand of lively fraying human comedy.

Details.Some movies nail them others miss. Part of the genius of ""American Hustle"" the lively fictionalized drama about the Abscam scandal from David O. Russell is that it gets all of them so absolutely right the poodle-esque permie curls that spring from the head the cylinderlike goldilocks that could only be produced with an expertly applied curling wand the plunging neckline heralding ample cleavage the shirt unbuttoned to reveal hefty gold chains and tufts of chest hair.Every little bit of clothing music and adornment in ""Hustle"" evokes the goofy sensibility that defined the 70s. To achieve such brilliant authenticity on screen costume designer Michael Wilkinson and production designer Judy Becker have clearly done their research; their efforts pay off with a comic bang.But ""Hustler"" isnt just about textured looks and sensations. Its just as much about this countrys mood and spirit with filmmaker Russell introducing us to larger-than-life dreamers con men politicos and mobsters caught up in a ""lets-make-money"" era.This is Russells follow to his sweet-natured Oscar nominee ""Silver Linings Playbook"" and a blast of outrageous rambunctious fun. Its also his best most fully realized work yet. Not only is it terrifically acted and perfectly cast its sexy and smart. I cant wait to see it again.Russell and screenwriter Eric Warren Singer have made engaging fiction out of history. For those in need of a tutorial Abscam was a government-sponsored sweep of corruption during the 70s and 80s that wound up corralling politicos who took the bait and got involved in shady deals.Advertisement Originally ""Hustle"" was envisioned as a more traditional overview of the sting operation. Russell modified that sprucing the screenplay up with his personal memories and reflections of the time along with doses of humor. The result is a character-rich story that distills down to its very essence of the 70s a time when Americans adopted affectations only to confront a dawning reality that left them wanting to drop phony facades. While Amy Adams and Christian Bale are the main stars this is a true ensemble set piece with one outstanding performance after another. Adams vampish and never more alluring plays Sydney Prosser a poser who adopts a phony British accent and hooks up with crafty Bronx con artist Irving Rosenfeld (a potbellied Bale in a bad toupee). In a sly move Bale speaks almost like Robert De Niro. Later in the film Irving meets up with a mobster played by -- who else? -- an uncredited De Niro. The priceless exchange is one of many.Sydney and Irving are two hucksters with big ambitions. They become partners and lovers even though Irving is married to the temperamental and just plain mental Rosalyn (Oscar-winner Jennifer Lawrence in one of the years best most lightning-in-a-bottle performances). Sydney and Irving find themselves caught in the ambitious cross hairs of the handsome but smarmy FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper so ideal for this part) who lives at home with his mom. DiMaso also sees the New Jersey mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) as his promotion-hopping meal ticket. To relate this big story -- which is reminiscent of a Martin Scorsese film -- Russell avoids the confinement of A-to-Z storytelling. He toys with time sequence and uses flashbacks along with alternating voice-over narrations to fully flesh it out. Executed poorly it would be a potential disaster. Here its pulled off with irresistible high spirits.Even with a freewheeling style ""Hustle"" is never aimless. All that flash sass and canny sense for detail hit the jackpot and will likely score more Oscar nominations for the Lawrence-Russell-Cooper dream team as well as for Russell regulars Bale and Adams. Theres a glut of holiday movies our right now vying for attention. This one is worth hustling over to see.

"Art of the Steal << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com  Previous The NBAs E-League  Next So Bad Its Good Sony Facebook Twitter Print Art Art of the Steal On American Hustle and The Desolation of Smaug by Wesley Morris on December 13 2013 The pills popped in American Hustle are prescription but the movie has a strange druggy energy. It could never pass a sobriety test -- not because its drunk but because its mentally off. Everybody keeps changing their minds their hair their accents. The running time is about 130 minutes. Thats quite some time to spend with a group of people -- Christian Bale Amy Adams Bradley Cooper Jennifer Lawrence -- playing psychological shell games. David O. Russell has built instability into the movie which he directed and cowrote. It is basically a caper film set in the late 1970s. But its a caper film in the way that origami is just a lot of folded-up paper. Irving Rosenfeld (Bale) and his mistress Sydney Prosser (Adams) are small-time New York con artists. They have a fantastic shtick. He plays a kind of impresario. Hes tall lumpy and sleazy-looking -- like a cross between a used-car salesman and a local-access television host. She classes him up. Perched on Irvings desk -- a little leg some cleavage a volcanic eruption of red hair -- shes a dame from London with access to money for loans. Shes velvet. Hes velour. For a fee (about 5000) they say theyll get you the money but never do. A prospective mark turns out to be Richie DiMaso (Cooper) an FBI agent who backs them into helping the bureau bring down other con artists. The fair thing to do at this point is to cease with the plot. American Hustle is loosely based on the FBIs so-called Abscam sting operation that brought down a handful of politicians on bribery and corruption charges. Basically theres a sheikh some gangsters and several occasions for characters to cavort in nightclubs that play the hits of Donna Summer. But the rest is a surprise. (The first image to show up onscreen is the sentence ""Some of this actually happened."") One reason not to belabor the details is that Russells sudden -- and very fictional -- reversals are part of the excitement of the experience. Nothing remains settled for long. Everyone is either scamming or being scammed. Most of them are scamming themselves. Irv Richie and Sydney target the mayor of Camden New Jersey a shabbily dressed bighearted bigger-haired family man named Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner). He meets with the gang in a hotel suite smells a rat and flees. Watching Carmine eventually succumb you feel bad because you sense the exploitation of his innate civic goodness. Theres also the way Bale plays this part Irv is unsightly and unseemly but there is something about him that cant be resisted. Mayor Polito might not know it but some of that something is sexual. Thats his angle with Sydney who in turn has a sharper sexual angle on both him and Richie. Not unsymbolically Irving owns a dry-cleaning business with Rosalyn (Lawrence) his feral cuckoo of a housewife. In one scene he and Sydney stand inside the curve of the clothes conveyor and stare at each other. She removes his tinted glasses and he stands stock-still and dumbstruck as shirts and coats and pants sail around them and their plastic casing caresses her hair. This is what passes for romance. With his defenses down Irving shares his line of work with Sydney then invites her to join him. She walks out of the room. But as he sits at his desk kicking himself a rather amazing thing occurs. This petite pretty dolorous American boomerangs back purring like an Englishwoman. Shes given herself a nom de scam -- ""Lady Edith Greensly"" -- and accepts his proposal. American Hustle is another of Russells screwball farces. Its as equally predicated upon calamity and delirium as Spanking the Monkey Flirting With Disaster Three Kings I [Heart] Huckabees The Fighter and Silver Linings Playbook. But its more antic and addled than the parties his last four movies were determined to be. He has situated the farce in the Long Island offices of the FBI ritzy Manhattan hotels and famous nightspots. Hes put it on the faces of the actors. Hes found Louis C.K. Michael Pena and Robert De Niro to play featured parts that allow them to look askance at the lunacy even as theyre reluctant participants. There was something smugly perfect about Flirting With Disaster and I [Heart] Huckabees. Russells artistic and philosophical ambitions were looking for a classic Hollywood home. The results were two wonderful movies that had wit and a directors control but little soul. The Fighter and Silver Linings Playbook on the other hand were the sort of conventional Hollywood movies that you might have expected Russell to turn up his nose at. But he took both assignments seriously and contorted them enough to make them feel distinctive. Whatever it is that has led Russell to devise his version of a Hollywood movie its nice to have. I could do without his tacked-on demand that farces end in familyhood the way romantic comedies end in marriage but his rhythms and tonal shifts are musical. Russell is 55 now and he doesnt seem out to prove anything. Dysfunction dominates American Hustle -- sexual conjugal occupational institutional sartorial. Robert Altmans movies could get that way strange and exhilaratingly sloppy; sometimes Billy Wilders too. Russell has matured into the messiness of this movie. After Sydney as Lady Edith tells Richie that their lovemaking has to wait until theyre actually in love she kicks him out of the nightclub stall theyd been sharing sits down on the toilet and lets out a wail. Shes a party wolf howling at the disco ball moon. That scene melts right into a different sort of club where Carmine and Irving are dancing drunk to Tom Joness ""Delilah."" The camera sways above them as if its sloshed too. The actors give the movie different sorts of mania. Cooper will never receive his due as a comedic actor. Hes too handsome and still seems a touch too douchey. But he owns that. Hes entirely physical here strutting speed-talking stuttering shifting. Richie shares a cramped apartment with his mother keeps his hair in rollers and skips out on his fiancee to paint the town with Lady Edith. Cooper was good in Silver Linings Playbook. Hes better here playing a guy who cant stop trying to upgrade himself (in love and at work) but who might be too stupid to keep up with everyone else in the game. Both Adams and Bale bring out a nice cockiness. He doesnt want to lose a scene to anyone but Adams isnt that sort of actress. If she sees you coming shell get out of the way. Russell has given Adams two of her most complicated roles parts that invert the naivete at the core of her persona. In The Fighter she was sweet but vulgar. Here shes sweet but psychologically disheveled. The beauty of Adams is her sense of strategy. She wont take a part that doesnt keep her ahead of the game. Lawrence meanwhile has a good time as a woman who doesnt appear to have had a complete thought in her life. Her mostly blonde hair just sits on top of her head as if she started doing it five years ago and forgot. She initially seems miscast. Is she going for a New York accent? Is she going for crazy? Can she play a semi-conniving dingbat? But she acts with a passion and humor and confidence that just wears you down. Bale deserves a prize simply for keeping a straight face in his scenes with her. Its easy to take Bales performance for granted. The comedy hes doing is serious. He makes himself the center of a movie whose core concern is authenticity. Who can be trusted? Whats real? Whos sane? The challenge for Russell is how to turn philosophy into cinema and comedy. One answer is props. Irv for instance wears a toupee. In the opening scene we see him haggard and overweight standing before a mirror applying it to the bald spot in the middle of his head. Its an actorly introduction but for the rest of the movie you cant stop staring at his hair -- not because its upstaging Bale but because its the movies first lie. Watching him pat it down and glue it I thought about De Niro looking at himself bloated demented and pitiful at the end of Martin Scorseses great boxing epic. Does Russell know that hes made a talkier fight movie? Raging Bullshit. So there we all were before midnight on a Thursday filing into an IMAX theater in Lincoln Center hundreds of us some in costumes desperate to be among the very first to see The Hobbit The Desolation of Smaug. This is the one in which the tiny burglar Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) and a troupe of dwarfs confront a fire-breathing dragon -- Smaug the Magnificent. Theyre making their way toward the end of a trilogy one that puts the slim 300-page J.R.R. Tolkien book on a deli slicer thats scheduled to produce close to eight hours of lunch meat. Part of what brought me out to watch it at midnight was the memory of seeing Peter Jacksons Lord of the Rings trilogy in one day 10 years ago in an enormous packed movie theater on the eve of the opening of The Return of the King. That day remains one of my favorite moviegoing events. Jackson was in top form. He had astounding control over the harmony of the visual effects and live action. The movies had the sweep and sense of self-importance that a big fantasy series ought to have. The creatures were inventive and had personality as did the actors playing the assortment of hobbits wizards and elves. Even when things were slow they were never dull. Jackson hasnt been the same since. The Hobbit feels like a last resort. The first movie -- An Unexpected Journey -- was shot and projected at 48 frames per second. It was meant to impart dreaminess. But it was like watching someone get high without you. There was a rollicking sequence set amid the cavernous home of goblins. It was warm and surprising. Some of it seemed to glow. The sequence was a reminder that Jackson still had the old magic but it was also a theme-park ride that was beside the point of Tolkiens book. The new movie doubles down on the amusement and pointlessness but without the frolic and shimmer of that goblin passage or the lively concurrent encounter between Bilbo and the tragic Gollum. Desolation of Smaug looks as dreary as the title would lead you to believe. The whole thing lingers in the memory as piles of sludge and ash. The movies achievement is the duration of the adventure sequences. One features a comical use of a barrel and fake-looking rapids but the movie rarely imparts any visual wonder. Smaug is something to see. It bellows in the voice of Benedict Cumberbatch who with this film his work as Khan in Star Trek Into Darkness and his performance as Julian Assange in The Fifth Estate closes out his year of spiteful distemper. But Smaug himself lacks the discursive manipulation that made him memorably unsafe in the book. Here hes just an excuse to do some flying and expel flames. How at that size and with all that fire Smaug doesnt incinerate any dwarfs is a mystery. Orlando Bloom returns as Legolas the elf prince and is joined by Evangeline Lilly as Tauriel who in her elf costume is a ringer for Liv Tyler who played a half-elf in the first trilogy. These two spend a lot of scenes leaping and slicing and spinning and stabbing. More than once you can see a digital version of the actors perform the motions like a kind of stunt-choreography on cruise control. After a while you get tired of trying to keep up and its not because youre watching a movie at two in the morning. Its because all the cross-cutting loses the action and stalls the momentum. Whole encounters begin before previous ones have ended. This is the most impatient 160-minute movie you will ever see. Before Desolation of Smaug began the audience stood to cheer a special guest Sir Ian McKellen. He plays Gandalf the Grey and came out to thank the audience. He and his pal Patrick Stewart are doing Harold Pinter and Samuel Beckett down on Broadway. He said the movie was for the fans that Jackson remains deeply committed to Tolkien and that the dragon bit goes on too long. It was the height of class and candor. (He was right about the dragon.) But you dont leave this movie satisfied that Jackson has given his all. You leave feeling like youre being strung along aware that with these films the line between fandom and fraud is fine. This isnt to say that the FBI in Russells movie needs to look into Jacksons. But this is no longer impassioned filmmaking. Its another scam.

Francois Duhamel/Sony - Columbia Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of David O. Russell makes hyperkinetic movies about hyperkinetic people. ""American Hustle"" his latest is a lot more enjoyable and offbeat than ""Silver Linings Playbook"" the most overrated movie of 2012. Still I didnt lose my mind over it. Its a lot of sound and fury signifying not much.The ""American"" in the films title is a clue that Russell who also served as co-writer with Eric Singer is reaching for something emblematic here. Its a burlesque loosely based on the 1970s-era Abscam FBI sting operation that nabbed seven members of Congress for taking bribes. What Russell is saying is that the con is as American as apple pie - and isnt that groovy?He trots out his stock company Christian Bale is the potbellied Irving Rosenfeld who dabbles in dry cleaning art forgery and personal loan scams. The first shot in the film is him trying to glue on his unruly comb-over. (This is the year for weight loss and gain in the movies Did Bale put on the weight that Matthew McConaughey took off for ""Dallas Buyers Club""?) Recommended The 50 best movies of all time Amy Adams is Sydney an expert faker except for her not-so-expert fake British accent. She and Irving are made for each other even though he has a wife Jennifer Lawrences Rosalyn a harridan who uses her son whom Irving has adopted as a way to prevent him from granting a divorce. Irving characterizes her not without cause as ""the Picasso of passive-aggressive."" The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide Bradley Cooper is Richie DiMaso an FBI agent who busts Sydney and Irving and then uses them as bait to land bigger catches. One of them is Camden N.J. mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) whose construction plans for Atlantic City casinos inevitably bring on the Mafia.Its a kaleidoscopic carnival structured from the viewpoint of each of its main protagonists. The film itself is devised a species of scam and for a while its fun to be in on the con. Russell is in effect playing us.But after a while the narrative convolutions seemed more hectic than exhilarating. The film suffers from late-stage Scorsese-itis - wacky low-slung high-octane melodrama with lots of yelling and overacting. Its also overlong. Russell tends to overdo even the good stuff. He keeps combing over the bare patches in the movie. Grade B (Rated R for pervasive language some sexual content and brief violence.)

American Hustle Somewhere between a raunchy All the Presidents Men and an emo Goodfellas. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 12 2013 700 PM American Hustle Somewhere between a raunchy All the Presidents Men and an emo Goodfellas. By Dana Stevens Amy Adams Bradley Cooper Jeremy Renner Christian Bale and Jennifer Lawrence in David O. Russells American Hustle. Courtesy of Francois Duhamel/Annapurna Productions/Sony Pictures The films of David O. Russell have a certain characteristic swagger a slightly self-mocking confidence that sometimes borders on the buffoonish. Russell (I Heart Huckabees The Fighter Silver Linings Playbook) loves protagonists who are thoroughly deluded as to their own ability to carry out whatever probably-unwise scheme theyve talked themselves into--but who charge ahead with it anyway. That makes him the perfect director for this seriocomic retelling of the story of Abscam an unlikely FBI sting operation in the late 70s and early 80s that grew from a small time stolen-property investigation into a full-fledged political scandal involving paid informants bribe-taking congressmen and FBI agents posing as Arab sheiks. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The true story of Abscam and its aftermath is significantly different--sadder and in many ways crazier--than Russells freewheeling remix. But its clear the director didnt set out to make a historically accurate political thriller. American Hustle lies somewhere on the spectrum between a raunchy All the Presidents Men and an emo Goodfellas. Its a sprawling sexy crime-and-corruption epic that playfully dodges its debt to history from its opening title--""some of this actually happened""--to its end-of-credits kicker ""This is a work of fiction."" And while theres no shortage of political and underworld intrigue Russells script--co-written with Eric Warren Singer--is less interested in the details of the Abscam operation than in the relationships among the outsize personalities behind its planning and execution. The biggest of all those personalities belong to Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) and Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) who as the movie begins are both lovers and partners in a variety of small-time confidence schemes. Irving operates a string of dry-cleaning stores that seem to do more figurative than literal laundering; he also fences stolen art for the black market and makes a killing guaranteeing bogus loans to anyone desperate enough to front him 5000 (a scam that when we see it in action cant help but evoke the financial chicanery that led to the crash of 2008). For their business transactions Sydney a born mimic and highly adroit liar adopts the persona of an English aristocrat Lady Edith Greensly a jetsetting sophisticate with a vast web of social connections. In actuality Sydney is just a hard-luck girl from Albuquerque who cant convince her married lover to leave his wife a much-younger former single mother named Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence). Overweight balding and outfitted in supremely ugly 70s high fashion Christian Bale has never looked worse or been better. Advertisement To invest in the outcome of the various questionably legal escapades that make up the last third of American Hustle you have to care about the Irving/Sydney/Rosalyn triangle and the first 20 minutes or so of the film do an excellent job of making that happen. Even if he is a paunchy middle-aged schmo with an epically bad combover--in the first scene we watch him methodically construct a complex edifice of half-real half-fake hair before heading out for a long day of grifting--you can see why Irving might appeal to these beautiful smart insecure young women. Hes an artist of the long con who takes real pride in his work not to mention joy in showing his ladies a good time on their ill-gotten spoils. Ever up for a challenge (and an Oscar) Bale gained 40 pounds to play the part of this Bronx-born scammer. Overweight balding and outfitted in supremely ugly 70s high fashion--I seem to recall a pumpkin-colored polyester three-piece suit--Bale has never looked worse or been better. Jennifer Lawrence is getting a lot of attention for her performance as the formidable Rosalyn whom she plays as a kind of old-Hollywood gangsters moll ditzy on the outside but inwardly cunning as a fox--the kind of self-possessed party girl who thinks nothing of flirting with a whole pack of Mafia thugs as a way of getting back at her philandering spouse. Shes very funny and wildly charismatic demonstrating a flair for comedy I hope she gets more chances to exercise. But its Amy Adams who has the tougher and more interesting role. Slinking around in Lycra dresses cut down to the navel her demeanor as unflappably cool as her eyes are desperate the steel-willed Sydney-turned-Lady Edith is a study in American self-reinvention and self-deception. ""My dream"" she tells us in voice-over--one of four voice-overs we hear from different characters points of view Casino-style--""was to become anything other than what I was."" In one late scene Sydney drops the posh accent defiantly revealing her unglamorous true self to a character who has a lot invested in the fantasy of Lady Edith Greensly. Its the kind of intimate emotionally volatile moment Russell excels at coaxing from his actors and Adams plays it with all shes got--in a movie full of operatic scenes its one of the more show-stopping arias. Russell has never been much of a stickler for structure. His films tend to be recognizable by their everything-but-the-kitchen-sink bagginess--and true to form American Hustle takes its sweet time setting up the complicated FBI plot at its center. The rogue agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper in a scene-stealing perm) eventually gathers so much dirt on Irving and Sydneys various con operations that they agree to work for him as informants to save themselves jail time. The net they cast will eventually haul in not only several members of Congress but the hardworking decent only slightly corrupt mayor of Camden N.J. Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) whos made the fateful mistake of believing Irving Rosenfeld is a friend he can trust. Louis C.K. appears looking stiff and uncomfortable in a small role as DiMasos perpetually naysaying FBI boss. An uncredited Robert DeNiro seems to be having more fun--quite a bit in fact--as an Italian mob boss who agrees to a sit-down with the Hispanic FBI-agent-turned-fake-Arab-sheik (Michael Pena). David O. Russell has filmmaking talent coming out of his ears but sometimes his movies seem like records of the struggle to control and manage that flow. I love American Hustles choppy idiosyncratic energy--it doesnt hit the beats youd expect from a crime epic just as Silver Linings Playbook didnt hit the beats youd expect from a romance. But Russells reliance on Scorsese-ian montages of wrongdoing scored to period pop hits--America the Bee Gees Donna Summer Elton John--becomes something of a tic midway through. Delightful as the soundtrack is these sleazily exultant musical interludes start to feel like bursts of energy in place of a plot. By the last scene its not clear just how much of substance there is behind the sleight-of-hand trickery of American Hustle. But the film pulls the wool (or glittery Lycra) over our eyes with such skill its hard to object. Correction Dec. 26 2013 This article originally said Abscam was not mentioned by name in the film. It was briefly. The actor Michael Pena was also misidentified as Richard Pena. (Return.) Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Francois Duhamel/Columbia Pictures hide caption toggle caption Francois Duhamel/Columbia Pictures A 70s con-artist couple (Christian Bale and Amy Adams) are forced to team up with an FBI agent (Bradley Cooper right) in American Hustle inspired by a real-life sting targeting corrupt politicians. Francois Duhamel/Columbia Pictures American Hustle Director David O. Russell Genre Drama Running Time 138 minutes Rated R for pervasive language some sexual content and brief violence With Christian Bale Amy Adams Bradley Cooper Jeremy Renner Jennifer Lawrence (Recommended) David O. Russell hovers at the top of my list of favorite directors. He captures the messy collision of self-interests that for him defines America. In American Hustle he whips up a black comedy based on Abscam the late-70s FBI sting that centered on a bogus sheik and led to the bribery convictions of sundry U.S. politicians. But he doesnt tell the real Abscam story; he adapts it to fit his theme which is that most of us are busy reinventing ourselves and conning one another. Christian Bale plays Irving Rosenfeld a master flimflam artist who steals from people desperate for bank loans. He and his lover and fellow swindler Sydney played by Amy Adams eventually get snared but the FBI agent in charge Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) offers a way out of the net Help him catch a bunch of bigger fish and theyll go free. It sounds like a routine plot but youve never seen it in clothes and hairstyles this garish. Bales Irving has the most outlandish comb-over in history thin strands and wayward puffs glued down and topped with a small ugly rug. A burgundy three-piece suit and aviator shades complete the hideous effect. Coopers Richie is a thin-skinned hothead with tight little curls. He and Irving spend much of the movie spraying testosterone at each other and competing for Sydney who affects a bad English accent to fool Richie -- whom she likes but doesnt trust. i Jennifer Lawrence plays the wife of Bales character a woman whos not especially pleased about how complicated their lives have become. Francois Duhamel/Columbia Pictures hide caption toggle caption Francois Duhamel/Columbia Pictures Jennifer Lawrence plays the wife of Bales character a woman whos not especially pleased about how complicated their lives have become. Francois Duhamel/Columbia Pictures American Hustle is loud and big. Russell out-Scorseses Scorsese with hyperbolic technique whip-pans whooshes slo-mo and tacky but great 70s chart-toppers. He winds his actors up and lets them loose. Bale is outrageously skeevy; Adams uses her blue eyes like stilettos. They put everything they have into scene after scene. The movie is like a slot machine that never stops spitting quarters. Jennifer Lawrence is the wild card as Irvings wife whos understandably jealous of his lover and doesnt care who knows. Under a high bleached beehive her baby face framed with ringlets Lawrences Rosalyn shoves a metal tray into the couples new microwave -- this after she was warned. But dont think that means shell say sorry when it blows. Who could have dreamed when Lawrence showed up as a grimly determined Ozarks teenager in Winters Bone that she had comic chops this spectacular? An opening title claims that some of American Hustle ""is actually true"" though it turns out not much if you read up. The sting was built around a bogus sheik but the real mayor of Camden N.J. Angelo Errichetti was corrupt to his toes. His on-screen counterpart Jeremy Renners Carmine Polito is a Boy Scout in an Elvis pompadour who talks of using the sheiks cash to put people back to work. So Irving the man who sets him up becomes a sort of Judas figure -- and suffers for it. It makes for a fine Hollywood climax but once you come down from the high you might wonder what Russells saying. That graft isnt bad if it helps cities get back on their feet? Maybe that is what hes saying. Russells affections are with small-time con men like Irving and the Army heroes in his Three Kings who are in the middle of a heist when they decide to risk their lives for Kurdish civilians abandoned by the U.S. In Russells world its the small-time crooks who see whats really going on -- as opposed to government suits or FBI agents who dont care about the little guy. You dont have to buy Russells moral relativism completely to think it makes for good political satire. American Hustle is a bit of a hustle itself but if Im being taken for a ride let it be as rollicking as this one.

Some. But maybe not a lot. Nominally its a film about the Abscam sting which roiled New Jersey politics during the disco era. But you wont hear any real names being used. (If you want those go to Ted Shermans great lookback and update at Inside Jersey magazine and nj.com.) And as for the movies most colorful details -- a coked-up FBI agent in hair curlers? A conwoman with a fake British accent? A murderous Miami mob boss? And a ditsy housewife who keeps setting fire to her home and nearly blows the whole deal? Those are more like the films scam -- on us. Except ""American Hustle"" does what great confidence tricksters do It makes you part of the trick. It makes you enjoy the hustle. And even later after you realize youve been conned -- after you begin to see where the smoke and mirrors came in -- you dont much mind too much because its all been so smoothly done. Jennifer Lawrence left and Amy Adams play a furious wife and mistress (the hairstyles alone tell you whos who) in American HustleCOLUMBIA The story centers on a character called Irv Rosenfeld played by a potbellied stogie-chomping male-pattern-baldness Christian Bale (its the Combover-As-Metaphor -- none of his lies will ever be as elaborately constructed as his Trumpean hairstyle). At first Irv isnt so much a clever conman as an absolute fraud -- he takes non-refundable fees to ""facilitate"" loans and does nothing. But then the FBI finds him and decides to turn him and his faux-British helper Sydney Prosser into bureau assets. So Irv and Sydney want to get off the hook? Fine. Then theyd better help this ambitious FBI guy land some big convictions. Hey how about fishing for a couple of crooked New Jersey politicians? Its not like the pond isnt well stocked. Director David O. Russells real interest isnt in the sting (although there is one lovely scam that crops up late in the film); its in the characters and the whole hello-gorgeous bridge-and-tunnel style they wear like a purple trench from Wilsons House of Suede. Its a wild mish-mash of styles with the women trying to out-glam each other and the men looking for (and finding) new depths of ridiculousness. (As a fictionalized mayor of Camden Jeremy Renner sports a hairdo even Joe Pesci would blanch at.) Yet its a contrast and sometimes a conflict matched by the movie which cant seem to make up its mind how to take all this. For example Bale and Amy Adams who plays his gorgeous grifting helper look like theyre in a drama one about trust and lies and dreams and re-invention; Jennifer Lawrence who plays Bales wife and Bradley Cooper who plays his FBI handler seem to be in a comedy about suburban eccentrics. Lawrence is the best thing in the movie a babyfaced bundle of pure Id obsessing over her nails and sunlamp tan a shrill shrike striking out at everybody around her (and then couching her attacks as mere truthtelling). And Bale -- although almost self-indulgently schlubby -- is completely this hungry huckster right down to the 14K-gold chains. N.J.

Cooper though is a little too manic right from the start -- hes still hitting that same nail on the head he did back in Russells ""Silver Linings Playbook."" And Adams though sexy in her clingy Cosmo-covergirl clothes seems unmoored -- her comes-and-goes English accent sometimes goes even when its not supposed to. But you can sense the actors giddy glee at playing these lowlife oddballs and with working with Russell again (the cast is pretty much a remix of his ""Silver Linings Playbook"" and ""The Fighter"" stars -- right down to a cameo by Robert De Niro). And Russell is definitely high on the sludgy `70s music the ugly kitchens and macrame bathing suits the antic energy of the whole era. And while its going on -- and this is the movies power -- you feel it too. Its great watching these oddballs bounce off each other (even if none of them truly logically connect). Its fun to revel in their snide sneaky games of confidence (even if there seem to be some leaps in logic). All in all ""American Hustle"" is a fun ride -- while it lasts. Just dont be surprised if afterwards walking out you wonder if you werent conned a little too. Ratings note The film contains sexual situations strong language substance abuse violence and brief nudity. American Hustle (R) Columbia (129 min.) Directed by David O. Russell.

American Hustle Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2013) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/american-hustle-2013,200,americanhustle28,americanhustle,rogerebert
"Review American Hustle shakes things up in madcap style - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review American Hustle shakes things up in madcap style The tale follows con men and scam artists as they do what they do best. (By Christy Khoshaba) Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic David O. Russell is a director on a hot streak an audacious original with an affinity for edgy American madness. His dizzying outlandishly entertaining ""American Hustle"" is a 21-first century screwball farce about 20th-century con men scam artists and those who dream of living large a film that is big hearted and off the wall in equal measure.As he demonstrated in his previous two pictures ""Silver Linings Playbook"" and ""The Fighter"" out of control people are Russells specialty. Like a cowboy working in the biggest of corrals he lets his characters roam as far and wide as they please before reining them in with perfect control at the close. In this film Russell has surrounded himself with actors hes worked with before -- Christian Bale and Amy Adams from ""The Fighter"" and Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper from ""Silver Linings"" -- and gone for broke. More specifically hes cannily used performers who excel at disappearing into their roles to play people who disappear with equal facility into their bogus identities.PHOTOS Movie scenes from American Hustle Being a Russell regular is not for the faint of heart. The director/co-writer makes a habit of standing just off camera and firing new lines at his actors while filming is going on. Once they get used to it the performers involved say its an exhilarating experience and Russells overall gift for immediacy leads to films that feel like theyre happening right there in front of us.""American Hustle"" began life with very different expectations. It started with a straight-ahead true crime script by Eric Warren Singer (Russells co-screenwriter) that dealt specifically with the details of Abscam a late 1970s FBI sting operation that led to bribery convictions for a U.S. senator and several members of the House.Using that reality as a taking off point Russell became interested in constructing fictitious characters and situations inspired as much by his imagination and inclinations as the actual Abscam shenanigans. ""Some of this actually happened"" is the line that appears on screen to start things off and it sets the tone perfectly.So back we go to 1978 to the era of gold chains aviator sunglasses outlandish clothes and hair that just wouldnt quit. In fact the first scene we see has paunchy balding Irving Rosenfeld (a completely unrecognizable Bale) painstakingly constructing the most elaborate hairpiece west of Asbury Park. VIDEO Watch American Hustle director editor discuss filmRosenfeld may look unprepossessing but in fact he has great gifts as a con artist as well as a willingness to do whatever it takes to survive. ""American Hustle"" briefly introduces him and his partner in crime Sydney Prosser (Adams) a seductive woman prone to wearing as little as the law allows in the midst of an especially stressful operation before flashing back to how their collaboration began.Thrown together at a Long Island pool party this larcenous pair bond over a shared passion for Duke Ellingtons ""Jeeps Blues"" as well as a birds-of-a-feather mutual belief in the absolute necessity of reinvention. As Prosser puts it ""my dream was to become anyone other than who I was.""Making use of Prossers alternate identity as Lady Edith Greenleigh complete with English accent these two form London Associates and become quite successful grifters. They also become lovers even though Rosenfeld is already married to the slightly unhinged Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence all in as usual) a woman he admiringly describes as ""the Picasso of passive-aggressive karate. I was her mark.""This slightly unbalanced apple cart is completely upset when Rosenfeld and Prosser have the unhappy experience of being busted by FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Cooper). He has grandiose intentions of going after other white collar criminals and sees his new victims as pawns essential in getting that operation off the ground.PHOTOS Golden Globe nominations snubs and surprises | Complete list of nomineesDiMaso is something of an unhinged hustler himself. The delusions of FBI glory that dance in his head combine with the attraction he feels for Sydney and the complexities of Irvings marriage to loose cannon Rosalyn to create disturbances in the field. These ensnare even nominally normal people like good guy New Jersey Mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner playing against type) who is the focus of DiMasos plans.Working with cinematographer Linus Sandgren and production designer Judy Becker Russell completely realizes this mad mad world and has peopled it with fine actors (Mary Vernieu and Lindsay Graham did the casting) from ""the feet up"" as the movie would have it. Worth noting aside from the stars are Louis C.K. as DiMasos FBI superior Colleen Camp as a key bureau operative and ""Silver Linings"" veteran Robert De Niro who seems to do his best work for Russell as a mafia chief whod as soon kill you as look at you. In the real world the protagonists of ""American Hustle"" are not individuals youd want to spend quality time with but Russell has the gift of making them seem just like us. Its ambition that unites these people that gets them in over their heads chasing dreams bigger than they can pay for. Can love of all things give them a shot at making themselves whole?

Russell Editors Picks Jennifer Lawrence Jeremy Renner Movie Awards Season Movies Oscars Our Picks Our Picks Movies Entertainment News Christian Bale Amy Adams and Bradley Cooper in ""American Hustle"" Its entirely possible that the real subject of ""American Hustle"" is not double-crossing con men widespread corruption and the uncontrolled hysteria of life in 1970s America but simply the movies outfits hairstyles and period soundtrack. But thats no small accomplishment what clothes what hair and what music Amy Adams succession of outrageous plunging necklines -- designed to mesmerize you and distract your focus from her mediocre English accent while she takes your money -- are worth the price of admission all by themselves. Constructed with tremendous cinematic verve and stacking terrific performances one atop another like logs beside the Yuletide hearth David O. Russells latest will strike many people as the best Scorsese movie since ""Goodfellas"" -- and without doubt the best not actually directed by Martin Scorsese.Russell has gone through a peculiar career renaissance over the last few years and is now one of Hollywoods most reliable A-list directors cranking out meaty star-powered dramedies that please critics Oscar voters and the paying public without quite feeling like pander-bear bait. His last two movies ""Silver Linings Playbook"" and ""The Fighter"" piled up more than a dozen Oscar nominations between them and provided Christian Bale Jennifer Lawrence and Melissa Leo with their biggest career prizes to date. Im not trying to impress you of Russells importance through statistics only observing that this is the same guy who spent more than a decade in indie-film purgatory after his breakthrough with ""Three Kings"" in 1999 which left everyone in Hollywood convinced that he was a control freak a tyrant and/or a ditherer who was impossible to work with.""American Hustle"" feels like the fulfillment of this comeback a work of tremendous confidence and dazzling showmanship that may just be a delirious movie-as-drug-high or may if you choose to read it this way contain a level of commentary about the nature of America and the illusioneering of Hollywood. Although the script co-written by Russell and Eric Singer draws extensively on the Abscam bribery scandal of the late 70s a particularly crazy news blip from an era of generalized insanity Im delighted that they never try to claim its all true. ""Some of this actually happened"" reads a title at the beginning of the film and thats inarguably correct. Indeed Christian Bales opaque Brando-esque performance as a Bronx-born Jewish con man named Irving Rosenfeld with an enormous gut and an elaborate combo of toupee and comb-over is clearly inspired by the real-life Mel Weinberg a hustler who like Irving was compelled or entrapped into working for the FBI.Russell flings us right into the middle of this outrageous yarn opening with Irving laboriously assembling his hairpiece in preparation for an attempt to bribe a politician in a luxury suite at Manhattans Plaza Hotel. From there we learn bit by bit how a small-time crook and dry-cleaning entrepreneur from the Grand Concourse wound up partnered with a smokin but obviously phony English noblewoman (Amy Adams) and a reckless ambitious hothead of an FBI agent named Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper). These people and everyone else in the story are drawn to one of late 20th-century Americas biggest honey pots the East Coast gambling breakthrough that led to casinos in Atlantic City.One of the running thematic gags in ""American Hustle"" I guess is the fact that Irving whose entire career has been built on two-bit scams is in some sense the most honest and genuine of these people. Adams character presents herself as ""Lady Edith Greenlee"" a babealicious Studio 54-type jet-setter somehow connected to London banking money but shes actually Sydney Prosser formerly of Albuquerque N.M. (Not a spoiler I promise.) Richie is a ferocious coke fiend -- if youve ever been around cocaine you wont have to see him snort up to know that -- who curls his hair cheats on his fiancee abuses his hapless superior (the mournful Louis C.K.) and will do absolutely anything to get ahead. You Might Also Like Thats without even getting to the movies second-tier characters who are if anything even better. How Jennifer Lawrence squeezed this movie into her schedule I have no idea but she damn near steals it all with her pathetic-appealing sexpot role as Irvings wife Rosalyn who is determined (at least at first) to win him back from the seductive Sydney or Edith or whoever the hell she is. One could argue that this is another one of those movies where an unprepossessing dude can pull two immensely hot women. But beneath Irvings flab atrocious hair and anti-fashion sense lies Christian Bale after all who can certainly capture the way an unattractive person sometimes exerts tremendous magnetism on those around him. Amid all the showboating of ""American Hustle"" Bale remains reticent and hooded playing a guy whose livelihood involves giving nothing away. I couldnt take my eyes off him (which is remarkable considering the available options).Russell also gives us an uncredited cameo by Robert De Niro I wont tell you about Michael Pena as a Mexican-American FBI agent posing as an Arab sheik Alessandro Nivola as a federal prosecutor who is basically the young Rudy Giuliani Jack Huston and Shea Whigham in supporting lowlife roles and numerous other delights. But I think my favorite of all these characters is Jeremy Renners Elvis-haired Carmine Polito the mayor of Camden N.J. and all-purpose mobbed-up Jersey power broker. (One of the key people brought down in the Abscam scandal was real-life Camden Mayor Angelo Errichetti.) Carmine is a genuine and generous old-school machine politician devoted to a city that has become largely black and brown who sees gambling the Mob and all the associated corruption as a necessary evil to get the stricken South Jersey economy back on its feet. He and Irving are kindred spirits honest crooks with no illusions who know how the world works. Once youve sucked down the eye-popping wardrobes the show-stopping performances and a soundtrack that ranges from Santanas ""Evil Ways"" to Tom Jones ""Delilah"" to ""Live and Let Die"" to what I believe is an Arabic cover version of Jefferson Airplanes ""White Rabbit"" much of the fun and mystery in ""American Hustle"" boils down to the long-con struggle between stoical Irving and fire-breathing Richie. Whos gaming whom most effectively and which one of them will get the girl (whoever she is and wherever she came from)? As I intimated earlier Im not convinced that plot details are especially important or even that ""American Hustle"" really has a plot. Its a fable of delusion and entropy all razzle-dazzle thats pulling a long con of its own and suggesting that all of American life is a colorful but meaningless shell game. But isnt it a pleasure to get hustled by such exquisite professionals?""American Hustle"" is now playing in major cities with national release to begin Dec. 20. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

Russell film ""American Hustle."" A con man (Christian Bale) along with his seductive British partner (Amy Adams) is forced to work for a wild FBI agent (Bradley Cooper). Also starring Jennifer Lawrence. (Photo Sony) By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Updated Dec. 12 2013 140 p.m. ET Ho hum another holiday season and another great movie from David O. Russell. Last year it was ""Silver Linings Playbook"" which was sensationally fresh and funny. This year its ""American Hustle"" which is sensationally fresh and funny in different ways. How does the guy do it? Where does he find the energy--not just his own which seems to be infinitely renewable these days but the comic energy that sustains his five stars? All of them--Christian Bale Amy Adams Bradley Cooper Jennifer Lawrence and Jeremy Renner--are at the top of their game in a hurtling roundelay that Eric Singer and the director based ever so vaguely on Abscam the sting operation of the late 1970s and early 80s in which the FBI recruited known con artists to ensnare a motley assortment of crooked public servants. WSJ Film Critic Joe Morgenstern reviews the seven-time Golden Globe nominee ""American Hustle."" Photo ""American Hustle""/Sony Pictures. ""Some of this actually happened"" a title card declares blithely at the start. It doesnt say ""Inspired By Real Events"" a claim thats usually a preface to distortions of fact in the name of dubious drama. This is fiction with a dramatic license that authorizes anything but boredom and the first scene a wordless and hilarious meditation on the theme of hair loss gives us a taste of whats to come. ""American Hustle"" is a celebration of the con from the hapless duplicity of a comb-over to the elaborate deceptions--and self-deceptions--of high-functioning hornswogglers bent on being anyone but who they actually are. The quicksilver plot is a function of evolving motives shifting allegiances and intricate betrayals. All I can tell you without resorting to flow charts is that Mr. Coopers Richie DiMaso a loose-cannon agent of the FBI dragoons Mr. Bales sleazy con man Irving Rosenfeld into organizing the government-funded con; that one of the operations targets is Carmine Polito a Jersey pol played by Mr. Renner; that Irvings partner in things amorous as well as criminal is a temptress named Sydney Prosser (Ms. Adams) and that his quick-witted floozy of a wife Ms. Lawrences Rosalyn bears watching at every step of the way. But then every one of these characters bears watching even though the film is too long and the pace is occasionally exhausting; better a surfeit of riches than no riches at all. (Danny Elfman did the music. The production was designed by Judy Becker. The cinematographer was Linus Sandgren.) ENLARGE Amy Adams left and Christian Bale in American Hustle Columbia Pictures The first thing you may notice about Irving is that hes flabby--or as Sydney says of him ""not necessarily in good shape."" Flab is new for Mr. Bale a shape-shifter who has made himself skeleton-thin on occasion. But whats truly new in his performance--indeed in his career--is the subtlety of his comic style. Instead of going for laughs the actor concentrates on Irvings antic self-seriousness and his ardor not to mention his bling. (In a vision of romance that comes out of nowhere Irving and Sydney embrace in the back of a dry-cleaning shop he owns while plastic-bagged clothes on mechanical tracks swirl around them.) Sydney is a changeling a sort of Sybil with multiple personalities minus most of the mental-health issues. Ms. Adams has been a changeling too in a wide range of roles. Yet shes newly spellbinding in the intensity she brings to Sydneys passion and fierce ambition. Related Bradley Cooper and Director David O. Russell Talk American Hustle As the driving force behind the sting Richie burns bright with a dim sense of ethics; in a criminal-intent contest between him and Irving its unclear who would win. Whats more he perms his hair as Sydney does with rollers that tell you all you need to know about his vanity. Mr. Cooper gives him a newer model of the motor-mouth he deployed in ""Silver Linings Playbook"" plus boundless mania; the FBI agent sprays cockeyed notions like a showerhead in a spa. A friend from New Jersey told me he couldnt buy Mr. Renner as the Elvis-haired mayor of Camden but Im from Jersey too and I bought him with pleasure. Ms. Lawrence as Rosalyn on the other hand is beyond price. Yes she was brilliant in ""Silver Linings Playbook"" last year. Still its astonishing that this almost-newly-minted movie star is appearing simultaneously this year as the action heroine of ""The Hunger Games Catching Fire"" and as a marvelously crafty wife and mother whos been reading a self-help book called ""The Power of Intention"" with the intention of prevailing come what may. Comedy seems to come naturally to her though so far theres no sign of anything in acting that doesnt. High-energy comedy comes naturally to the filmmaker. He exults in free association emotional riffs in the craziness that underlies ostensibly rational behavior. The crosscurrents have crosscurrents in his films but the current that carries everything along here is announced by the first strains of music from the screen Duke Ellingtons ""Jeeps Blues"" with one of the most exuberant passages in all of jazz. David O. Russell does buoyancy better than anyone. Watch a clip from the film ""Saving Mr. Banks."" Author P. L. Travers (Emma Thompson) reflects on her childhood while meeting with filmmaker Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) during production for the adaptation of her novel Mary Poppins. (Photo/Video Disney) Saving Mr. Banks ""Saving Mr. Banks"" wraps a seduction inside a seduction with enjoyable results. Its a Disney film in every sense of the term. The seduction in the story is conducted by Walt Disney himself; hes played with savvy verve and genial authority by Tom Hanks. (John Lee Hancock directed with a graceful touch.) The year is 1961 and Walt--as he urges everyone to call him--has decided that the time has finally come to secure the rights to ""Mary Poppins"" from the books creator P.L. Travers; shes played with sparkling wit and deliciously acidic scorn by Emma Thompson. Since Mrs. Travers--as she insists on being called--has steadfastly refused to have her characters sullied by what she sees as Hollywood vulgarity Walt invites her to fly from her home in London to Los Angeles. There during two weeks on the Disney lot he and his staff charm her cajole her and try to reassure her by showing her how they intend to bring Mary Poppins George Banks and all her other beloved characters to the screen. ENLARGE Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) shows Disneyland to Mary Poppins author P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) in Saving Mr. Banks. Disney This is a rich idea for a movie about a movie and the cultural combat between the purist author and the motion-picture maestro provides lively entertainment. Mrs. Travers is on the wrong side--the losing side that will prove to be the winning side since we know what a triumph Disneys ""Mary Poppins"" turned out to be. Still Ms. Thompson elevates every element of a notably astute script by Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith. As a killjoy railing about ""jollification"" she turns the remarkable trick of making Mrs. Travers insufferable and endearing at the same time. (The cinematographer John Schwartzman turns his own trick of shooting in a style that combines at appropriate times a modern palette with Disney-bright cheer.) ""Saving Mr. Banks"" isnt just a saga of seduction and persuasion. The film examines the roots of the Mary Poppins myth and thus the core of its authors personality. It does that by flashing back with relentless regularity to Maryborough Australia where Mrs. Travers was born as Helen Lyndon Goff in 1899. Although this structure draws simplistic inferences as pop-psychological explorations often do Colin Farrell gives a standout performance in a relatively small role as Helens volatile father a bank clerk with a drinking problem and the flashbacks prepare the way for irresistibly affecting passages in which Walt and Mrs. Travers find commonality in their troubled childhoods. But thats where the other seduction comes in. Were asked to accept these two bright forceful people as reasonable versions of their real-life counterparts. The accuracy of their arguments in the ""Mary Poppins"" production meetings is in fact supported by some startling audio tape that plays over the closing credits. Yet the movie does to them as historical figures what Mrs. Travers feared Disney would do to her book and its characters. Theres no hint of Walt Disneys reputation as a tyrant--hardly surprising given the productions provenenance--or of Mrs. Travers as the tortured soul she was. Edges have been softened harshness has been transformed into happiness sprinkled with eccentricity. And the paradox of course is that were glad to be seduced. As Disney films go this is a good one. Watch a clip ""The Hobbit"" film sequel ""The Desolation of Smaug"" featuring Evangeline Lilly as the elf Tauriel and Orlando Bloom reprising his role as Legolas from ""The Lord of the Rings"" film trilogy. (Photo/Video Warner Bros.) The Hobbit The Desolation of Smaug The news is greatly encouraging about the second installment of Peter Jacksons ""Hobbit"" trilogy but Ill keep it short. Making it long would mean going into all the dramatis personae and dramatis creaturae of the J.R.R. Tolkien tale and what the good guys were doing when last seen in Middle-earth on the way to reclaiming the dwarf kingdom of Erebor from the dragon Smaug. Suffice it to say that Martin Freemans Bilbo Baggins and Ian McKellens Gandalf the Grey are back along with the 13 dwarves led by Richard Armitages Thorin Oakenshield and that the latest lap of their journey is far more focused and much more exciting than the last one. ENLARGE The character Azog in The Hobbit The Desolation of Smaug Warner Bros. Pictures Thats because everything that needed establishing has been established so the journeyers hit the road in expeditious fashion and Mr. Jackson and his virtuoso colleagues stage much of the action with the visual vocabulary of a good old-fashioned chase. (Dwarves in barrels rub a dub dub escape their enemies by floating down a white-water river.) Theres a stronger feminine presence this time thanks to Evangeline Lillys Tauriel--600 years old and never more beautiful--and an awesome dragon presence thanks not only to Smaugs blast-furnace breath but to his sub-basso voice which was provided before subsequent digital fiddling by Benedict Cumberbatch. My advice to ""Hobbit"" fans is not only to see this one but to see it as I did in 3-D projected at the normal rate of 24 frames per second. The film will also be shown in whats called High Frame Rate 3-D at 48 frames a second but that made the last installment look more like video than a regular movie. Smaug is scary enough without a turbo boost. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download ""The Grifters"" (1990) ENLARGE The movies no con; its the real thing. John Cusack giving one of the best performances of his career plays Roy Dillon a two-bit con man in love with Annette Bening and Anjelica Huston plays Roys steely mother in this deft tough-minded comedy from Donald E. Westlakes adaptation of the Jim Thompson novel. Stephen Frears directed a flawless cast that includes Stephen Tobolowsky Jimmy Noonan Henry Jones and Sandy Baron. Dennis Gassner designed the production. Elmer Bernstein did the music. The cinematographer was Oliver Stapleton. ENLARGE ""F For Fake"" (1973) Orson Welles was one of the most extravagantly gifted figures in the history of film. (He made ""Citizen Kane"" when he was in his mid-20s.) By his own account he was also a total fake. That account is enshrined in this filmed dissertation on the nature of hoaxes and hoaxers. Mr. Welles holds forth on other fakes among them the illustrious art forger Elmyr de Hory and his blithely crooked biographer Clifford Irving. Yet he reserves his richest scorn and his greatest delight for his mendacious capacious self. ENLARGE ""Nine Queens"" (2000) Theres no honor among the Buenos Aires thieves of ""Nine Queens"" a Spanish-language debut feature by Fabian Bielinsky. Its hard to tell the con man from the mark but thats what were asked to do after two swindlers join forces to sell a supposedly rare set of forged stamps. Ricardo Darin is Marcos an experienced scammer searching for a smart associate who can learn the tricks of the trade. I wasnt smart enough to see what was going on in Mr. Bielinskys Mamet-like house of mirrors until the very end.

Russells latest is an exhilarating disco dance of a movie full of unbridled energy.David O. Russells latest film American Hustle sports an all-star cast that includes Bradley Cooper left Jeremy Renner Christian Bale and Jennifer Lawrence.(Photo Francois Duhamel Sony/Columbia Pictures)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY Review    1/2 out of fourStars Christian Bale Bradley Cooper Amy Adams Jennifer Lawrence Jeremy RennerRated R; runtime 2 hours 18 minutes; opens Friday in select citiesEvery once in a while a movie will come along that makes you sit up excitedly in your seat eagerly anticipating its every move.American Hustle (   1/2 out of four; rated R; opens Friday in select cities) is just such a movie.With one of the best ensemble casts of any film this year its audacious enthralling and uproarious.Theres not much substance underlying the razzle-dazzle of this complicated caper but viewers will be so mesmerized by the blend of brilliant acting outlandish incidents rousing music and well-timed humor that any deeper meanings will not be missed.Its nearly impossible not to be drawn into the wild and woolly fictionalized portrayal of the notorious Abscam financial fraud case of the 1970s. Its dubious authenticity is succinctly captured by a caveat in the opening credits ""Some of this actually happened.""EXCLUSIVE Inside the last days of American HustleSTORY Lifes a Hustle for Jennifer LawrenceMORE Secret cameos of American HustleAWARDS 12 Years Hustle lead Golden Globe nominationsREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYAnd what didnt occur in reality came from the inventive imagination of director David O. Russell. Hes a master of unconventional movies that stir the audiences fascination (think Three Kings or The Fighter). He also knows how to make a crowd-pleaser (last years Silver Linings Playbook). Much of it has to do with spot-on casting and several of the actors in Silver Linings and The Fighter play key roles here.A pair of lovey-dovey con artists a family-minded politician an overzealous FBI agent a fake sheik an unpredictable scorned wife and a few nefarious mobsters all figure into the deliriously farcical mix. Paranoia strikes deep. Corruption reigns. And its all ridiculously funny.At times the film rambles. When it does conclude the ending may not completely satisfy audiences. But none of that truly mars the energetic experience of getting there.Going back to 1996s Flirting With Disaster Russell is at his best with freewheeling farces. He builds upon Eric Singers screenplay with a sharp focus on personalities over plot.While the film may invite comparisons to Paul Thomas Andersons Boogie Nights or Martin Scorseses Goodfellas Russells is a singular irrepressible and intriguingly off-kilter vision.He has fashioned a bizarre and mesmerizing narrative of a swindler who cooperates with authorities to bait and trap politicians in an elaborate scheme centered on Atlantic City casinos.That con man is Irving Rosenfeld a pot-bellied larcenous scoundrel with the worst comb-over since Bill Murrays in the 1996 film Kingpin. Christian Bale is magnificent in this richly comic role for which he gained significant weight.Told simply the sting involves Rosenfeld and an FBI operative posing as an Arab sheik (Michael Pena). Masterminding much of it is another follicle-challenged fellow -- FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) who nightly wears a head full of curlers in the apartment he shares with his nagging mom.The ambitious DiMaso is constantly at odds with his reasonable boss (Louis C.K.). DiMaso walks all over him -- and then some.Rosenfeld owns several dry-cleaning establishments. But his side business selling art forgeries and investments in fake companies is where his heart lies. His heart is soon also drawn to the seductive Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) his match in the art of the con. Everyone here is a master of disguise.A classic schemer in his business dealings Rosenfeld does have a moral code. He has a fierce love and sense of duty to the young son of his conniving wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence). He is determined to provide for the little boy he adopted when he married Rosalyn. Lawrence is brassy loose-lipped and riotously funny.Jeremy Renner plays Carmine Polito an altruistic New Jersey mayor who strikes up a friendship with the Rosenfelds and gets sucked into the Atlantic City scam. Renner -- sporting a modest pompadour -- is terrific as Polito whose motto is ""All people are good. Be good to all people.""Gloriously entertaining and brimming with unbridled energy American Hustle will make you feel like dancing. 42 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/Jk3qKbHoliday Movie Calendar DecemberTake a look at the films heading to the box office this December complete with trailers reviews previews and more.

Russell; Release Date Limited 12/13/2013; Runtime (in minutes) 138; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Sony Pictures Entertainment Posted January 15 2014 -- 1200 AM EST David O. Russell has been directing movies for two decades but it was only last year in Silver Linings Playbook that he broke through with his full true filmmaking voice madcap but grounded working at a fever pitch of skewed passion. American Hustle Russells brilliant swirling amphetamine high of a movie about deep-dish chicanery in the late 1970s makes good on Silver Linings promise. Its a film of jaw-dropping virtuosity and pleasure one that leaves you revved enthralled tickled moved and amazed. Its as if the Scorsese of GoodFellas had been revived full-throttle only with a new subject the hucksterism hiding in the shadows of middle-class America. The central characters are a pair of con artists who are indefensible and also irresistible. In the opening scene Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) plasters on his complex comb-over and if we chuckle at the lowly kitschiness of his appearance it also lets us know that Irving is a walking fraud. Hes a pinky-ring-wearing shyster from the Bronx who owns a chain of dry cleaners but specializes in fleecing people; he operates a loan business that takes 5000 down payments and gives nothing back. At a Long Island pool party Irving meets Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) a hot number who falls for him when they bond over their shared passion for Duke Ellington. Its only later though when Sydney learns that Irving is a con man that we see what kindred spirits they are. She puts on a faux-British accent and turns herself into ""Lady Edith Greensly"" a posh Londoner with banking connections. Theyre small-time operators but its their karma to be nabbed by Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) a beady-eyed scrounger of an FBI agent. Its the post-Watergate era and Richie rabid for a big corruption bust coerces the two into joining a sting operation thats just about as slovenly as their petty scams. Its called Abscam and it involves shady congressmen a New Jersey mayor (Jeremy Renner) who wants to rebuild Atlantic City actors pretending to be wealthy Arab sheikhs and of course the Mob. American Hustle is based on a true story -- or as a droll opening title puts it ""Some of this actually happened."" There really was an Abscam down to the fake sheikhs and a con man used to entrap congressmen (his name was Mel Weinberg). The thrill of American Hustle is that it takes the tacky desperation of this scheme -- and of the whole Carter era -- and fuses it with the spirit of our own madly scrambling moment when the system once again seems rigged and people increasingly do whatever it takes to get by. Watching American Hustle you never know whats coming next and you can hardly wait to see it happen. The movie is a caper in which everyone is conning everyone and the deepest cons are personal As ""insurance"" Sydney pretends to fall for Richie and we along with Irving are left wondering if she has. The movies exhilaration is in how Russells filmmaking fever lights up everything it touches. His pop-music cues come close to out-Scorsese-ing Scorsese from the use of Steely Dans ""Dirty Work"" to accompany Irving Sydney and Richie walking with a briefcase full of cash to a mash-up of Todd Rundgren and Donna Summer that enticingly evokes the rapture of disco clubbing. And if Russells perky camera zooms are a little too Marty his knowledge of women is something else He gets astounding performances from Adams who is hell on wheels and Jennifer Lawrence who plays Irvings manipulative wife with a crazy-sexy fury that dares to be toxic. As for Bale hes fantastic as a lying sleaze with a hidden heart. Its one of the films rippling ironies that the FBI agent violates every code of decency to entrap crooks and his prime target (that Jersey mayor) is the most honorable person on screen. In American Hustle down is up right is wrong the con is the truth and David O. Russell has become the most exciting filmmaker in America.

A tale of ill-gotten gain overweening ambition and overwide lapels ""American Hustle"" is a highly fictionalized version of the FBIs Hauppauge-based Abscam operation which took down a dozen public officials yet ended in a public black eye for the agency. Its unlikely heroes are Long Islander Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) a successful con man with an unsuccessful toupee and his loyal but street-smart girlfriend Sydney Prosser (an extraordinary Amy Adams). Nabbed by the FBI the two are forced into a sting operation led by excitable agent Richie DiMaso (a curly-headed Bradley Cooper). Irving advises going for small fish but Richie wants whales. Soon theyre targeting New Jersey politician Carmine Polito (an empathetic Jeremy Renner) various congressmen and unwisely the Mafia.

Its a high-spirited lark that works thanks to Russells dazzling direction delicious period details and a parade of stellar performances. The movies wildest card is Jennifer Lawrence as Irvings volatile wife Rosalyn whose mood swings threaten to upend the entire operation. Some of Russells tricks feel familiar but they mostly work. One is his deft way of fox-trotting his characters back and forth until whirling them together in one bravura sequence of fast-moving crosscutting action -- in this case a formal party teetering on disaster. Less effective is Russells use of pop chestnuts (Steely Dan Chicago the Bee Gees) to set a mood or make a point. Lawrences mad-housewife rendition of Paul McCartneys ""Live and Let Die"" may be a gonzo hoot but it also feels too broad for this otherwise sublime movie. Despite some small missteps ""American Hustle"" moves with an energy thats irresistible. A less skilled director might have turned it into mess but Russell always keeps the beat. 224 MoviesAmerican Hustle trailer PLOT A con man his girlfriend and an overambitious FBI agent combine to make a volatile team. advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING R (language nudity violence drug use) CAST Christian Bale Amy Adams Bradley Cooper LENGTH 218 BOTTOM LINE Another high-energy dazzler from David O.

Russell-directed film alongside Christian Bale Bradley Cooper Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner Credit Annapurna Productions LLC In theaters Friday December 13 3.5 stars (out of 4) Once again the winner is...Jennifer Lawrence. In a dazzling movie about the art of the con the actress --- playing a feisty and frustrated New York housewife --- manages to steal all her scenes. And thats no small feat given the powerhouse lineup in this latest offering from director David O. Russell (Silver Linings Playbook). PHOTOS Jennifer Lawrences early modeling years The opening disclaimer --- which reads ""Some of this really happened"" -- sets the tongue-in-cheek tone about the FBI investigation that took down a slew of politicians in the late 70s and early 80s. Here the bedlam starts with oily scam artist Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale who packed on 50 pounds to get that sizable gut). Hes smugly self-satisfied on his dry cleaning businesses and fake art dealership when he meets slinky Sydney (Amy Adams). She cooks up a posh British accent and a new name and the two set up an elaborate phony-baloney loan business. PHOTOS Jennifer Lawrence and other stars with pixie cuts While they celebrate their success in bed Irvings wife Rosalyn (Lawrence) taps her well-manicured nails at home in the Long Island suburbs with their son. But complications dont mean a thing as long as they all have the green. That is until Irving and Sydney get busted by an undercover agent (Bradley Cooper). To avoid jail theyre persuaded by the hotheaded fed to reel in an amiable New Jersey mayor (Jeremy Renner) in over his head in a corrupt gambling scheme. Even with the meaty narrative style trumps substance. And frankly after a fall season dominated by harrowing survival stories its a welcome relief to see actors in their prime be outrageous and let their hair down. So to speak anyway In this case the men go to amusing lengths to primp their coifs. (Bale meticulously covers bald-spot with a comb-over; Cooper sits at home with his mother with his hair in tiny pink curlers). Adams meanwhile stuns in a series of sexy low-cut dresses that also serve as an advertisement for double-stick tape. In fact when the principals meet at a nightclub to set up a sting the rapid-fire dialogue is secondary to Adams plunging neckline and Lawrences va-va-voom number and brassy updo. And its an essential scene PHOTOS Best movies of 2012 Yes Lawrence. She and her Silver Linings love Cooper share scant quality screen time together but the young actress proves she doesnt need a male costar to guide her. Her big moments come in a flash most memorably when after tattling on her husband she belts out ""Live and Let Die"" in her house. Wearing yellow dish gloves. At age 23 she has the gravitas and charm to seduce Bale in the bedroom Adams in a bathroom and just for good measure a mobster in a car. Hope shes clearing her mantel for more trophies. She might as well get those press-on nails gold-plated too.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet ""Some of this actually happened"" swears American Hustle right at the onset in the place where most movies ""based on a true story""--no matter how loosely--are advertising as much. This five-word disclaimer maybe the most honest moment in a film about constant dishonesty does more than just prepare the audience for dramatic liberties. It also announces that Hustle the wildly entertaining new comedy from David O. Russell will adhere less to facts than to the laws of chaos that govern all the directors screwball concoctions. The subject is Abscam a famous late-70s early-80s FBI sting operation in which the feds created a phony foreign sheik to ensnare a bunch of crooked congressmen. Yet the movie is no more about politics than The Fighter was about boxing or Three Kings was about Desert Storm. For Russell who used to make high-volume indie comedies and now makes high-volume Hollywood ones every story is just a fresh opportunity to send neurotic personalities careening off of each other. And boy does he have a whole gallery of them this time.With its multiple voice-over narrations and vintage-jukebox soundtrack American Hustle initially finds Russell operating quite blatantly in knockoff Scorsese mode. The film begins like Goodfellas out of sequence before winding back to the place where two-bit con man Irving (Christian Bale rocking a beer belly and comb-over) first meets his partner in love and crime Sydney (a terrific Amy Adams). The two run a small-potatoes scam bilking desperate clients out of their 5K investment until an ambitious FBI agent Richie (Bradley Cooper) brings the hammer down on their whole show. Its with the arrival of this power-hungry lawman who coerces Irving and Sydney into devising an elaborate trap for dirty politicians that Russells gift for multi-character comic mayhem begins to rear its head.American Hustle turns out to be a freewheeling party of a movie one that never stops adding complications and wrinkles and hungry new players to the mix. Irving its belatedly revealed has a young space-cadet wife he neglects; shes played by a brassy crowd-pleasing Jennifer Lawrence who barrels violently into every one of her scenes. (Russell hooked as always on instability turns the character with her loose-lipped indiscretion into his supreme agent of chaos.) Sydney who hedges her bets by cozying up to the plainly smitten Richie pretends to be a British expatriate and its one of the movies best gags that no one can hear through her very shaky come-and-go accent. Hustle piles subplots on top of plots A less busy more conventional movie could have been built entirely off the complicated friendship between Irving and Jersey mayor Carmine (Jeremy Renner) whose essential decency--hes a true altruist corruption aside--sends the former into a minor guilt spiral. This is one of those comedies in which just about everyone on-screen is funny from Robert De Niro spoofing his crime-movie career in an inspired cameo to Louis C.K. who has a great running gag about an anecdote hes never allowed to finish. But who are these desperate con artists these scrambling swindlers put under the gun? Russell never quite decides; hes too busy having a ball to go much deeper than deceptive surfaces. (Whether for example Sydney really has affection for Richie or is just faking it remains something of a mystery.) Then again perhaps thats the point Per its title American Hustle is about the bluffs disguises and bald-faced scams necessary to make it--honestly or otherwise--in this country. Everyone is playing a part a fact Russell foregrounds by beginning the movie with an extended scene of Irving pasting on his hairpiece. Yet for all its focus on misdirection and masquerade Hustle cuts to at least one surprising truth Bradley Cooper the once-obnoxious alpha-male star of The Hangover series has transformed into a remarkably talented comic performer. As in Russells Silver Linings Playbook the actor finds his sweet spot by going big like when Richie can barely contain his glee--his arrogant incredulous joy--as a mark incriminates himself on tape. For Cooper and his director loss of control is liberating.

By David Denby Amy Adams Christian Bale Jennifer Lawrence Bradley Cooper and Jeremy Renner in David O. Russells new movie based on the Abscam scandal of the nineteen-seventies.   Credit Illustration by Michael Gillette David O. Russells ""American Hustle"" an intentionally overripe comedy about corruption duplicity loyalty and love is a series of astonishments. Russell rewriting a script developed by Eric Singer takes off from the Abscam affair--the bizarre criminal investigation of the nineteen-seventies in which the F.B.I. called on a swindler named Mel Weinberg to help ensnare public officials. (Six congressmen and a senator were among those ultimately convicted.) The bureaus elaborate sting involved two ""Arab sheikhs"" (both F.B.I. employees) eager to invest in Atlantic Citys nascent casino industry and willing to bribe officials in order to procure operating licenses. (""Abscam"" was short for ""Abdul scam."") Russell has both simplified and juiced a tale that is already close to preposterous; he has created a fantasia told from the point of view of two con artists a man and a woman (based loosely on Weinbergs mistress). Not just the crooks but virtually everyone in the movie seems slightly crazed by ambition. The one person whos ordinary in temperament an F.B.I. supervisor played by Louis C.K. could be a member of a different species. We seem to have stepped into the magical sphere--Shakespeare rules over it and Ernst Lubitsch and Preston Sturges are denizens--where profound human foolishness becomes a form of grace. Christian Bale bearded and forty pounds heavier with a complex and unreliable hairpiece (parts of it come loose at unsuitable moments) is Irving Rosenfeld who owns a chain of dry cleaners in New York and sells forged and stolen art on the side. Like all successful con men Irving has a serene understanding of deception most people hes sure will believe what they want to believe. Hes deeply dishonest but not in most ways a terrible man. Irving wants things to work out for people; his half-goodness is part of the expanding joke of the movie. During a winter indoor-pool party at a friends house on Long Island he meets an ambitious young woman Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) a former stripper who is alarmingly intelligent and determined to make something of herself. She and Irving bond over a mutual love of Duke Ellington and begin an affair. Sydney also joins Irvings scams posing as a British aristocrat with banking connections; she wears dresses cleaved to the waist and boldly stares everyone down while quaking in her high heels. When the pair are caught by a high-strung F.B.I. agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) they wind up working for the bureau carrying out Richies big-time sting. Racing around New York Irving occasionally goes home to his luscious nutbrain wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) who has a habit of blundering into his arrangements at exactly the wrong time. The movie evokes such classics as ""Married to the Mob"" ""Goodfellas"" and ""Prizzis Honor"" but it has a fizziness all its own and a pell-mell but lucid storytelling strategy that is one of the most impressive achievements in recent filmmaking. Like ""Goodfellas"" this movie uses voice-over to swing us into the action offering first Irvings view of the world then Sydneys then the two in alternation as the characters expound on their up-from-the-bottom ethos of survival. They are matched in avidity by Richie who lives at home with his mother and sets his straight hair with curlers so that he can look sexy-Italian. His desire for Sydney is aroused so quickly that he tries to pry her loose from Irving even as hes arresting her. She flirts with him and maybe falls for him but in any case shes determined to use him. Currents of love and jealousy electrify the convoluted many-faceted operation that the three pull off. In Russells ""Silver Linings Playbook"" Coopers patented anxiety--the burning blue eyes and the motormouth feverishness--nagged and clogged the early scenes. But here his rapid-fire attack is comically just right. Richie isnt as bright as he thinks he is; his mind works erratically and Russell leaves some air around Coopers lines many of which take startlingly odd turns. Sprucing up like John Travolta getting ready for the disco in ""Saturday Night Fever"" (which came out in the same period in which this movie is set) Cooper wears a medallion on his exposed chest. His night on the disco floor with Amy Adams is the dreamiest of consummations--theyre both great dancers. One of Irving and Sydneys swindles involves loans that are promised but never paid. Its the only serious plot mistake that Russell makes--as portrayed its flatly unconvincing--but you pass over it because the momentum of the story is irresistible. Working with the cinematographer Linus Sandgren Russell takes the camera smoothly and rapidly through offices restaurants and parties feeding one episode into the next and linking them with movement or narration like sustained musical phrases. In a few scenes a character silently mouths the words of the song playing on the soundtrack as if propelled by the beat in his head. The movie has a ceaseless flow; the music of greed never stops. Richie summons a New Jersey politician Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner with a serious pompadour) to the Plaza Hotel and offers him a suitcase full of money to help clear the way for the casinos. Carmine refuses and leaves but Irving chases him down in front of the hotel and makes a personal connection with him. A true artist must keep things moving toward the instant of seduction and Irving and Carmine partying with their wives become friends. The suborning of public officials requires drink music and long nights in restaurants and ""American Hustle"" is rich in jubilant sociability. ""Always take the favor over money"" Irving advises Carmine which is an outrageous thing to say since he has just successfully bribed him. At another level though Irving means it as he guiltily begins to do favors for the man he has trapped. Carmine wants to get the casinos going so that his constituents can find jobs and Irvings attempt to protect him becomes a complicating and moving strain in the movie. ""American Hustle"" is built around many acts of cynical manipulation but it is generous even kindly in spirit. Corruption and con artistry in this telling are mutually dependent and not always evil. The single truly malevolent figure is a Mafia boss from Miami (played by Robert De Niro) whose sinister jokes make Irving and Richie panic at the thought of what they have got into. Some of the behavior onscreen is so outlandish that you wonder at times if the entire movie isnt a put-on but then a surge of feeling or an idiosyncratic moment brings you back to the common ground of devotion and to the mysteries of human character. Russell has finally reached the kind of sustained heightened excitement that he has been working toward ever since he directed the satirical ""Flirting with Disaster"" in 1996. (He reached it in parts of ""The Fighter."") What he puts on the screen here is faster than life and more volatile than common realism but its definitely not farce. His characters act stupidly because they want something desperately and his actors all of them taking enormous risks form an ensemble that is the equal of anything from Hollywoods golden age. Jennifer Lawrences needy stay-at-home wife has buttery golden looks and piled-up blond hair--shes a vulgar beauty with a bedroom voice. Lawrence doesnt project; she pours passing without hesitation from teasing sensuality to strident bitchiness and abject anger. Amy Adams has played nice (""Junebug"" ""Doubt"") and she has played hard (""The Master""); this movie allows her to pull the two together and shes remarkably vivid in scene after scene. Sydney vamps Irving in one of his dry-cleaning establishments wearing his customers fancy clothes. (In a dizzying touch suits hanging on a garment conveyor whirl past them as they kiss.) She grabs at a chance for the good life even in borrowed dresses and Adams throwing back her head in triumph captures the spirit of American drive. When Adams and Lawrence playing rivals for Irvings affection meet at last its literally a face-off strength against strength at a distance of a few inches and the screen explodes. The object of this war is an unlikely prize but Bale makes shrewdness sexy. A Welsh actor playing Bronx Jewish in a sludgy voice Bale is funny from the first scene but he doesnt try for laughs--a man with a hairpiece needs to stay in control. The real Mel Weinberg is still alive somewhere in Florida and Bale persuades you that his character is tough enough to live forever. ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" and ""Nebraska"" are the current standards of what a serious Hollywood movie looks like. ""American Hustle"" offers so many easy pleasures that people may not think of it as a work of art but it is. In the world that Russell has created if you dont come to play youre not fully alive. An art devoted to appetite has as much right to screen immortality as the most austere formal invention.  David Denby has been a staff writer and film critic at The New Yorker since 1998.

These are but initial impressions American Hustle a dynamite crime comedy and identity meltdown that can rekindle ones faith in movies will no doubt jostle allegiances like tourists in the back of a cab. Theres still the matter of Sydney (Amy Adams)--or maybe shes Lady Edith Greensly a British financier clad in plunging 70s couture. All of them are in on a grift (and a love triangle) that takes them from the storage space of a dry cleaner to the undulating dance floor of Studio 54 and even the hotel-room buggings of the Abscam sting. The scope of the script (by Eric Warren Singer and director David O. Russell) is amazingly wide for what always felt like a grubby chapter of post-Watergate malfeasance. But Russell has figured out how to make his performers fly--the actors are all playing actors basically--and hes brought back his original neuroticism to boot. Does American Hustle have heart--does it have importance? Such naive questions It has Jennifer Lawrence blowing up a microwave. When Hollywood is made to go blazingly fast like this its a felony to complain.

MOVIE REVIEW American Hustle Boogie snooze. Running time 138 minutes. Rated R (profanity sexual content brief violence). At the E-Walk the Village 7 So David O. Russell invited over some interesting actors (and also Bradley Cooper) to be filmed at a 1970s theme party. Too bad that footage didnt make a movie. Or rather its too many movies ""American Hustle"" which has its roots in a true story and has already won several critics awards is in part a satire of lower-middle-class strivers (those dorks) in part a con-job movie sort of a mob thriller. Its a little bit ""Boogie Nights"" a little bit ""Argo"" a little bit ""GoodFellas."" Its a breath mint its a chewing gum its a laxative its a hockey puck. Id forgive Russell (""The Fighter"" ""Silver Linings Playbook"") who co-wrote and directed if he did anything particularly well but the con-job material is diffuse the mob danger consists of Robert De Niro clocking in as a menacing gangster for one scene and the humor consists mostly of ""Wow look at that hair"" moments. When the people who kit out your actors are funnier than your script maybe satire isnt your calling. Whats best about ""Hustle"" is Christian Bale who plays a Bronx-bred owner of a chain of dry-cleaning stores with a plan to make it big or at least biggish His dream American if you like is to defraud innocents with a fake-loan business. His sloped shoulders nuclear comb-over and cringing eyebrows make him the one character its possible to connect with here. He has an affair with a fellow low-rent scam artist (Amy Adams) who fakes an English accent. Both attract the attention of FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper -- look at that hair) who offers to let them off the hook if they can help him run another scam this one involving a corrupt New Jersey mayor (Jeremy Renner) trying to bring casinos to Atlantic City. Theres a fake sheik in there somewhere too and you may remember if barely the underlying true story of the 70s ""Abscam"" plot that led to the conviction of several congressmen and a senator. But that part of the story -- the one part that matters -- interests Russell the least. So hey check out the hair on Jennifer Lawrence She (badly over-)plays Bales brassy wife Rosalyn and demonstrates the difference between an exterior style -- attacking rather than playing her character whereas Bale actually wonders what its like to be this ""Irving Rosenfeld"" who is deeply wounded when someone messes with his comb-over. In moments of rare splendor Irving invites a girl to one of his dry cleaning shops where he spins his magical carousel and offers her . . . her pick of the unclaimed used clothes. If only Russell could find more such moments of strange loopy bliss. Instead when lost for something to do he simply fires up the Steely Dan or Chicago and sends his camera gliding along to drink in costumes and sets. Entire scenes accomplish nothing except provide the actors with emoting space (Lawrence spends several minutes demonically cleaning the house to the strains of ""Live and Let Die"") or clutter up the story with sidemen (like Louis C.K. pointlessly thrown in as Richies boss). Were told that Rosalyn has a big mouth and will spoil everything. Next scene She mouths off. Except there are no real consequences. So why bother? And why do we go off on a tangent about DiMaso slugging his boss with a phone if that bit is going to be shrugged off also? And why does everyone celebrate the self-incrimination of an irrelevant lawyer who wasnt a target of the sting? ""American Hustle"" is a movie that was built backward or inside out It puts actors needs before the audiences. Theres no heart under those polyester lapels and what all that Aqua Net is pasting together is a few sparse strands of wispy story.

Theyre not necessarily dishonest; they just cant resist making the truth shinier than it is in real life. There may not be much behind the sparkling tinsel curtain of David O. Russells extraordinarily entertaining American Hustle. But what a curtain Christian Bale in an endearingly artificial hairpiece Amy Adams in a series of slippery 70s dresses cut down to there Jennifer Lawrence in a tousled blond updo two parts Ellen Barkin to one part Angie Dickinson Theres tons of artifice in American Hustle but its not the 3D special-effects kind and thats the joy of it. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Russell works this particular con the old-fashioned American way with faces and costumes and characters who do outlandish things. And even within its crazy parameters its based albeit loosely on real life Russell and his co-writer Eric Singer drew from elements of the Abscam sting of the late 1970s. An early title card reads ""Some of this actually happened"" which is so much more whimsically truthful than your standard ""based on actual events."" Bale plays Bronx-born con artist Irving Rosenfeld In the opening scene we watch as he carefully spirit-glues a mat of fake hair onto his cue ball pate. As absurd as this painstaking ritual is he looks much better with the rug and his main squeeze Sydney Prosser (Adams) seems to think so too. Shes a vixen who speaks with a pinkie-up British accent -- though shes really from Albuquerque -- and shes Irvings partner in a number of naughty little schemes from selling forged art to charging poor schmoes outrageous fees with the promise of securing financing for their businesses.Related StoriesJennifer Lawrence Hustles but Joy Does Her No FavorsFilm DetailsCritics Pick American Hustle RatingR GenreDrama Running Time129 More Info Theyre in love and desperately happy but for two complications Theyve attracted the attention of loose-cannon FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper with a decidedly unsexiest-man-alive perm) who busts them but offers a deal if theyll help snare a few baddies and corrupt politicians. Plus Irving has a wife and kid and as unscrupulous as he is in his business dealings hes principled enough to want to stick by them.And so he does even after wife Rosalyn played by Lawrence nearly sets the family home aflame by falling asleep under a sunlamp Lawrence makes her entrance like a harlequin her face half crimson. Later she tangles with mobsters at a social function thats crucial to the FBI bust shimmying up to them with the flirty flooziness of one of Dean Martins Golddiggers. Russell hardly the most sensual of filmmakers delights in Lawrence which may be one reason the movie works so well. Hes the sort of director who seldom delights in anything but American Hustle is his version of a soft-shoe. By taking a break from being self-consciously earnest (Silver Linings Playbook) bare-knuckles gritty (The Fighter) and aggressively experimental (I Heart Huckabees) Russell has shaken something loose. Youd never credit him with a light touch but American Hustle cruises along like a line of wedding guests doing the Electric Slide. Its plot mechanics are impossible to take seriously and yet deeply pleasurable to parse right up to the whos-screwing-whom ending.Russell cinematographer Linus Sandgren and production designer Judy Becker dont take the easy route of making 70s New York look tawdry and faded; its sparkly a little tacky anything but a hard-luck rat hole. Thats the proper environment for this ensemble Bale may not be the most believable scrapper but at least hes dropped most of his usual capital-A Actor mannerisms. Jeremy Renner plays Carmine Polito mayor of Camden New Jersey an upstanding politician who becomes a pawn of the FBI -- hes boyishly charismatic in his Bobby Darin pompadour. Adams has some fun playing a scheming strumpet a switch from the girl-next-door roles shes often stuck with. Cooper with those goofy curls makes a good foil for her Richie is smitten with Sydney thinking shes out of his league socially when really she has scrambled up from the bottom. When he woos her his eyes take on the softness of a cartoon puppy.But its Lawrence who brings the most air and energy to American Hustle. Seemingly everyone loves her these days maybe partly because she gives the most uncanned interviews of any celebrity in recent memory. When Vogue writer Jonathan Van Meter showed up to talk to her she pounced on his RadioShack tape recorder ""This thing is archaic. Are you going to write this whole thing out longhand with like a pen?"" As both a celebrity and an actress she has no interest in keeping her cool with us -- that would be boring. Her Rosalyn is both the liveliest character and the most honest a woman who likes to put on a killer dress and paint the town. Yet one line of dialogue indicates that shes prone to depression unwilling or unable to even leave the house. Even when Rosalyn is in party-girl mode you can still see that muted sadness; Lawrence keeps it simmering on low. Rosalyn isnt in on Irvings con; shes too much of a live wire to keep his secrets (and she may have one of her own). You can see why she drives him nuts and you can see why he loved her so much in the first place. Shes dazzling like a dangly earring. She may be shiny but shes for real.

Russells dramatic comedy about the Abscam scandal By Richard Corliss Dec. 05 2013 Share Read Later Send to Kindle Francois Duhamel / Columbia Pictures Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture Irving Rosenfeld approaches the bathroom mirror without bothering to ask whos the fairest of them all. Paunchy of gut and bald on top he knows he has work to do. Like a surgeon of sleaze he glues a toupee thatch to his pate arranges the lank hair on his temples across his skull and shellacs the whole mop with hair spray. Now he just needs to suck in his gut and don a three-piece suit and -- voila -- hes 1970s New Jerseys idea of a presentable businessman. Con man that is Irving sells art forgeries and takes money for investments in fantasy companies. Charles Ponzi might say with a connoisseurs appreciation ""Now thats a schemer."" You watch the first scene of American Hustle and think Thats Christian Bale doing another of his life-imperiling body transformations. Bale lost 62 lb. from a muscular 182 to an emaciated 120 for the lead role in The Machinist; somehow he survived. This time he gained 40 lb. and walked with an older mans slouch. For his trouble he herniated two discs. He also crept inside Irvings body and spirit to play -- no to convincingly be -- a grifter working the long con. Doesnt everybody really see through white lies and easy evasions? ""Were all conning ourselves one way or another"" Irving-Bale says ""just to get through life."" The best way we can think of to get through 140 minutes of your life would be to see American Hustle a balls-out story about political corruption that director and co-writer David O. Russell turned into a crazy conniving comedy history replayed as sparkling farce. Russell reunited the star pairs from his last two films -- Bale and Amy Adams from The Fighter Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence from Silver Linings Playbook -- then Cuisinarted the romantic alliances until everyone had a chance to get screwed one way or another. The New York Film Critics Circle recently acknowledged the toxic tonic splendor of American Hustle by giving it prizes for Best Film Best Supporting Actress (Lawrence) and Best Screenplay (Eric Warren Singer and Russell). These should be the first of many awards from now until Oscar night. (MORE American Hustle takes aim at the Oscars) The movie opens with a title card that reads ""Some of this actually happened"" and concludes in the last of the end credits with the disclaimer ""This is a work of fiction."" In other words trust no one in the movie to give you the facts and dont trust the movie either. (Singers original script had the more accurate title American Bullshit.) Its a semi-true take on Abscam the infamous sting operation in which the FBI beginning in 1978 videotaped politicians who accepted bribes for political favors. A daring bluff that led to the conviction of U.S. Senator Harrison ""Pete"" Williams and six other members of Congress Abscam was the Argo ruse -- but in the U.S. not in Iran and with a nonexistent hotel instead of a fake movie as the bait. It also lacks anyone that Hollywood might identify as a hero. In the Russell-Singer comb-over of the facts Irving juggles the demands of his mouthy wife Rosalyn (Lawrence) and his sham-English girlfriend Sydney (Adams) while reluctantly cooperating with an ambitious FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Cooper) in the proposed sting of Camden Mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) and other Jersey officials. In a movie with four narrators the point of view is necessarily skewed and the viewers sympathy shifts as Richie falls for Sydney Irving begins sympathizing with Carmine and Rosalyn fools around with Mafia cutie Pete Musane (Jack Huston late of Boardwalk Empire). ""Everybody at the bottom crosses paths"" Sydney observes ""in pools of desperation."" But the real bottom-feeder the most ruthless frantic manipulator may be Richie the Fed. (MORE Corliss on David O. Russells The Fighter and Silver Linings Playbook) That opening scene with Irving at the mirror hints that American Hustle might settle for mocking the 70s the ultimate bad-hair decade and for metropolitan New York City a scream of bankruptcy and graffiti. The film does make fond fun of the music clothes and decor which earn kudos for production designer Judy Becker costumer Michael Wilkinson and music supervisor Susan Jacobs. There is a disco scene and that 70s marvel the microwave. (Told not to put metal inside her new ""science oven"" Rosalyn promptly inserts a casserole with tinfoil and the thing explodes.) But all these references are in the service of channeling the flailing energy of that time. This was the last New York City decade defined not by the wretched excesses of the superrich -- the scam artists on Wall Street -- but by the ferocious occasionally criminal strivings of the middle and lower classes. These snarling underdogs defined New York City movies too. Though American Hustle resembles Martin Scorseses Goodfellas and Casino in certain particulars of plot and milieu (but not in its visual style which is more functional than Scorsese-ecstatic) the real touchstones for its outer-borough shenanigans are Saturday Night Fever and the Sidney Lumet films Serpico and Dog Day Afternoon manic street operas in which the arias were Italians and Jews shouting at one another. (Russell is Jewish on his fathers side Italian on his mothers.) The films masterly organization of chaos and intelligence is a reminder that comedy is just tragedy but faster and it underlines the slick timidity of what passes for movie comedy today. (MORE a tribute to director Sidney Lumet) The real Abscam story was no less strange. The Irving character Melvin Weinberg was indeed a grifter who considered himself a world-class actor. ""Playing someone else still comes easy"" he told the Chicago Tribune in 1985. ""Its my life."" One of his meatiest roles was fronting the Abscam sting in order to avoid a prison sentence on 10 counts of fraud. Mel did have a girlfriend the English-born Evelyn Knight and a wife Marie. (Mel was 54 in 1978; Marie 46.) During his time testifying at the trials in 1979 Mel moved with Marie to Tequesta Hills Fla. secretly setting up Evelyn in a nearby condo. Boisterous marital confrontations ensued and Mel moved in with Evelyn. In 1981 when Marie sued for divorce Mel asked her to delay the action until he concluded negotiations on an Abscam movie Moon Over Miami to be directed by Louis Malle and starring John Belushi as Mel. On Jan. 21 1982 the ABC news program 20/20 aired a segment in which correspondent Tom Jarriel quizzed Mel about allegations that he kept gifts he was supposed to pass on to public officials. When he denied this Jarriel showed him a videotape of Marie in her kitchen turning a microwave to show that the serial numbers had been removed. Mel spumed his denials unconvincingly. A week later Marie was found hanged in a condo adjacent to her own with a note that read ""My sin was wanting to love and be loved nothing more."" Mels eloquent elegy to his late wife ""She was a cuckoo."" On March 5 Belushi died scotching the movie project. Two days after that Mel married Evelyn. (MORE our 1980 Abscam cover story by subscribing to TIME) That story would make a compelling movie as well. American Hustle is less an expose than a character study of people who may not have much character but do live by their own odd ethical code. Take Sydney for example. The duplicity that is a means to an end for Irving is her golden goal. ""My dream more than anything was to become anyone other than who I was"" she tells Irving as they make out among revolving racks of clothes at one of the dry-cleaning stores he owns. She left Phoenix adopted what she thought sounded like a posh English accent and perhaps in tribute to Barbara Stanwycks aristocratic alter ego in The Lady Eve called herself Lady Edith Greenley. Sporting couture with V-necklines that plunge to the navel Sydney is a molls vision of class a bland blonde transformed into a vixen by her own iron will. She demands the same commitment from Irving telling him ""Youre nothing to me until youre everything."" Adams were convinced can do anything comedy (Junebug) drama (The Master) musical theater (Into the Woods at New York Citys Shakespeare in the Park). This year she aced Lois Lane in Man of Steel and the best-friend role in Spike Jonzes her. (MORE Corliss on Amy Adams in Spike Jonzes her) She carries the first half of American Hustle working in tones subtler but no less intense than those of the other stars. Shes amazing in a scene where Sydney confesses to Irving that shes not English royalty. Emptying herself of affectation Adams keeps swerving in and out of her Brit accent. By the end her eyes are filled with tears that damn it she will not let drop. Even when losing control a lady must keep her poise. Lawrences Rosalyn -- the woman Irving leaves at home the better to frolic with Sydney -- is no lady. But she has the con artists knack of getting what she wants by threat sex appeal or whine; Irving calls her ""the Picasso of passive-aggressive karate."" Playing a woman who in real life was twice her age the 23-year-old Lawrence makes Rosalyn a hot number as explosive as aluminum foil in a microwave. Rosalyn describes the odor of her nail polish as ""sweet and sour like flowers but also garbage."" Thats how Lawrence plays her she exudes the heavy intoxicating scent of danger. And when this ignored wife realizes her power to put the kibosh on Irving and by extension the whole Abscam sting she blossoms or festers into a creature worthy of a Mafia mans ardor. (MORE Laura Stampler on Jennifer Lawrence Your Imaginary Best Friend) Heroically stolid in the Hunger Games movies appealingly morose in Silver Linings Playbook -- and in those films a treat to watch as she expressed complex emotions with virtually no facial tics or sweeping gestures -- Lawrence gives this movies most overtly comic performance lending Rosalyn a body and dynamism rarely seen since Judy Holliday played the not-so-dumb blonde Billie Dawn in Born Yesterday 63 years ago. She doesnt so much steal the second half of American Hustle as own it. Adams effectively passes the baton to her in a superb acting ensemble dominated by the actresses. We do not mean to demean the male leads. Cooper a hoot in hair rollers summons the ferrety fury of Al Pacino in Dog Day Afternoon ups the IQ and applies the razors edge of satire to Richies big dreams. Renner plays Carmine (a sweetened version of real Camden mayor and New Jersey state senator Angelo Errichetti) as a peoples politician an idealist wholl take money in the casino deal to bring thousands of jobs to Atlantic City. The surprise here is that Renner so impressive in The Hurt Locker but largely stranded and cramped in tough-guy hero roles ever since finds Carmines soul through delicate comic timing. No wonder Irving feels sympathy for the guy -- hes less a villain than a gregarious putz. (Also excellent Louis CK as Richies FBI boss and Robert De Niro in an unbilled role as Mafia fixer Victor Tellegio.) (MORE Our praise for Jeremy Renner in The Hurt Locker) Reveling in its 70s milieu and in the eternal abrasion of sexy women and covetous men American Hustle is an urban eruption of flat-out fun -- the sharpest most exhilarating comedy in years.

Russells ""American Hustle"" due to an abiding interest in the American ABSCAM scandal of the late 1970s and early 1980s it would behoove you to remember that Russells film was originally titled ""American Bullshit"" and its packed with plenty of that. While Russells film is ostensibly centered on the scandal - it opens with a title card confessing that ""Some of this actually happened"" - its far more preoccupied with the interpersonal relationships of the wild characters that participated in said scandal (and the loads of BS that was exchanged between them). With an outstanding cast that includes the likes of Christian Bale Amy Adams Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence that preoccupation is nothing to sniff at (and yes there is plenty of surreptitious sniffing in the feature) but while ""American Hustle"" succeeds when it comes to casting and characters its dragged down by a murky and poorly-paced narrative. At its heart ""American Hustle"" is about hearts - two really - that of Irving Rosenfeld (Bale) and Sydney Prosser (Adams) a pair of con artists who meet at a party and start the process of wooing each other without missing a beat. Irving has grown up a con artist the son of a glassmaker who went around smashing windows to drum up business for his dad though hes tried to keep things straight with some legit businesses. That line of work doesnt really suit him however and when he meets the stunning Sydney hes been spending far more time with his illegal enterprises like loan-sharking and counterfeit art dealing. Sydney similarly grew up trying to be someone else and while shes firmly entrenched in the ""fake it until you make it"" line of thinking she opens up her true self to Irv almost against her will. The pairs love story unfolds swiftly and snappily with Russell both reveling in their affection and poking fun at our cinematic perception of romance (the pair dance across Park Ave. in a particularly ill-advised series of steps that cant help but feel both lovely and totally insane). Both natural cons Irving and Sydney succeed in criminal business together (Sydneys classy-sounding put-on British accent and feminine wiles certainly complement Irvings tough-talking business chatter) and just as it seems that everything is going swimmingly were hit with a double whammy - Irving is married and both Sydney and Irv have been pinched by the FBI. ""The FBI"" in this case is Bradley Cooper deliciously over-the-top deranged and dedicated as agent Richie DiMaso who promises his newly trapped cons a deal - get us four other criminals and well let you go. Cue hijinks? ""American Hustle"" should be Russells punchiest film yet - it certainly has all the pieces in place from solid talent to an intriguing storyline to borderline perfect costumes and sets - but the end result falls flat more than once and its sagging middle is only saved by its enjoyable characters. Narratively ""American Hustle"" is all over the map and while Russell harnesses some major zip and pizzazz when it comes the films first fifteen minutes and its final sequences most everything between moves along without much coherent flow or consistent excitement. Russell utilizes a few techniques to keep the narrative of his and Eric Singers script pumping (trading voiceovers between Bale Adams and Cooper is inspired though its not used nearly enough) and even reveals a few twists in the process but its not enough to fully engage in the films complicated and unsatisfying story. Most of ""American Hustle"" puts a premium on style and sparkle over substance. At least it can deliver on that (and in spades) as the time period of the film essentially serves as its own character and one that does not disappoint in the slightest - Michael Wilkinsons costume designs Judy Beckers overall production design and the entire coterie of hair stylists and make-up artists are all near-revelatory and exceedingly well-executed. ""American Hustle"" has plenty to recommend it for entertainment value alone but if audiences are simply looking for the best-outfitted film of the year the buck very firmly stops here. However ""American Hustle"" is truly a showcase for talents and characters and what happens when these two elements meet. The films greatest asset is that its positively bursting with colorful characters that are so engaging that they nearly make up for its slack story. Amy Adams is outstanding as the sexy dangerous and very complicated Sydney tasked with flitting between the sensitive Syd and the calmly collected ""Edith Greensly"" her amusingly executed British alter ego. ""American Hustle"" can be big and flashy but Adams performance is packed with plenty of subtle facial expressions and telling body language and she is the one graced with the most nuance. On the other side of the coin is a positively unleashed Jennifer Lawrence as Irvs delightfully bonkers wife Roslyn. Russells direction has so far proven fortuitous for Lawrence - after all he did direct her to her first Oscar - but he also seems adept at getting the actress to tap into something primal and fierce thats also still just dead funny. Jennifer Lawrence is the last person who needs a breakout role these days but her Roslyn marries ""unhinged"" with ""entertaining"" in a wholly unique manner and its only a shame we dont see more of her. Its particularly refreshing to see Christian Bale having what looks to be genuine fun in a role particularly after his recent turns as the very morose Bruce Wayne in ""The Dark Knight"" franchise and the thoroughly dour Russell Baze in ""Out of the Furnace."" Bale seems to relish his role truly ""from the feet up"" even making his frequent hairpiece adjustments seem zippy and fun. Cooper too appears to have had a fantastic time as the fast-talking and deeply weird Richie and he handily delivers some of the best moments of the entire film. Despite populating his film with a number of multi-faceted and compelling characters Russell does stumble when it comes to Jeremy Renners role as Mayor Carmine Polito one of the ""baddies"" at the center of the scandal. While the four principal roles in the film are reasonably complex and rounded out Polito is portrayed as some sort of above-the-law angel and that lack of shading is jarring. While ""American Hustle"" disappoints from a story standpoint and fails its perceived status as a worthwhile Oscar contender it still satisfies on the strength of its wholly entertaining cast of characters and visually appealing look and feel. It may not leave much of a mark upon first blush but its bold highlights seem engineered to ensure decades of fans yelling out about ""science ovens"" and hoping that someone will recognize such brilliance.

Russells deliriously funny account of the notorious Abscam case. Youve seen smoother more elegant con movies than ""American Hustle"" but probably none quite so big-hearted or so rudely insistently entertaining. As directed by that master of modern farce David O. Russell this sprawling fictionalized account of the notorious Abscam case is less a dramatic FBI procedural than a human comedy writ large ringing a series of screwball variations on themes of duplicity and paranoia against a dazzling 70s backdrop. Deliriously funny and brilliantly acted by a cast of Russell returnees the film is also overlong undisciplined and absent the sort of emotional payoff that made ""Silver Linings Playbook"" so satisfying which could affect its otherwise solid theatrical prospects. Still this star-studded Sony prestige release is a near-continual pleasure to spend 135 minutes with repeatedly hitting that comic sweet spot where corruption and buffoonery collide. After putting his sharp but crowd-pleasing stamp on the boxing drama with 2010s ""The Fighter"" and the romantic comedy with last years ""Silver Linings Playbook"" Russell has taken appreciable risks with ""American Hustle"" as he and co-screenwriter Eric Warren Singer (""The International"") chart a shaggy meandering journey across a sweeping and colorful true-crime canvas. Notably this is Russells first foray into period filmmaking (not counting his First Gulf War drama ""Three Kings"") and he and his collaborators -- particularly production designer Judy Becker costume designer Michael Wilkinson composer Danny Elfman and above all music supervisor Susan Jacobs -- have hurled themselves into their mid-70s New Jersey milieu with a palpable delight in the garish excesses of the era. Loud fashions and outsized shades abound from the first scene in which paunchy middle-aged Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) fusses with an elaborate hairpiece -- a perfect intro to a movie about the joy and for these professional tricksters the necessity of donning false identities. The screenwriters may have changed their characters names to protect the not-so-innocent (""Some of this actually happened"" notes an opening title card) but knowing viewers will recognize Irving as a stand-in for Mel Weinberg a Long Island scam artist who joined forces with the FBI to avoid prison time. Out of that unlikely partnership emerged Abscam an audacious sting operation that pushed federal undercover work to controversial new levels of manipulation and entrapment resulting in the bribery convictions for seven congressmen and various other government officials in 1981. Given Russells instinctive affection for loudmouths outcasts and head cases its neither a surprise nor a stretch for him to identify with Irving a relatively honorable small-time hustler and a sort of dilettante among frauds He owns a legit dry-cleaning business but moonlights as an art forger and loan shark bilking desperate applicants out of a few thousand dollars at a time. But things change when he falls hard for smart beautiful redhead Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) an unlikely kindred spirit who adopting the seductive worldly alias of a British businesswoman named Lady Edith swiftly moves Irvings scam into the big leagues. Irving is married (more on that later) but he and Sydney/Edith make such splendid sexy partners in crime that they soon draw the attention of ambitious FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper rocking a dark brown perm) who catches them mid-fraud and strongarms them into working undercover for the bureau. Its typical of the films topsy-turvy moral universe that Richie comes across as no less shady demented or reckless than his reluctant informants throwing caution to the wind -- and riling his straight-laced boss (a wonderfully surly Louis C.K.) -- as he strives to root out corruption in high places even if it means planting the means and opportunity himself. Soon Richies using Irving to target Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) the popular mayor of Camden N.J. by dangling a 2 million foreign investment that will supposedly help rebuild Atlantic Citys casino-resort scene. If all that sounds complicated ""American Hustle"" is just getting warmed up. To maintain a convincing front Richie presses the Bureau for cash while Irving invents a deep-pocketed Arab sheikh (actually a Mexican-American FBI agent played by Michael Pena) momentarily rousing the suspicion of one of Carmines more dangerous associates Victor Tellegio (Robert De Niro in a terrific one-scene cameo that introduces the films sole moment of pulse-quickening menace). But it soon becomes clear that the chief threat to their survival isnt Tellegio but Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) Irvings outspoken irrepressible loon of a wife whose intense jealousy of Sydney and insistence on getting her way threaten to topple the whole operation. Rosalyn may be no con artist but its Lawrence who steals the picture giving another marvelously unpredictable performance in an entirely different key from that of her Oscar-winning turn in ""Silver Linings Playbook"" (or needless to say her starring role in ""The Hunger Games"" franchise). Of all the fine actors returning from ""Playbook"" (Cooper De Niro) and ""The Fighter"" (Bale Adams) Lawrence is the one who feels like the purest embodiment of Russells ethos a natural-born comic spitfire whose lightning shifts in mood and flashes of temper suggest unfiltered emissions from the writer-directors subconscious. Brazenly flirting with mobsters one minute and setting the kitchen ablaze the next Rosalyn is ferocious maddening and impossible not to love. She isnt however the only big personality who occasionally yanks the film away from its predetermined course assuming such a course existed to begin with. On some level Russell and Singer havent fully cracked the story here much less figured out the most focused way to tell it; those hoping for a dry meticulous version of the Abscam narrative should stick to Wikipedia. But although its not without its drawbacks -- namely a lack of tension over the long haul and an abrupt dramatically soft conclusion -- this exaggerated human-circus approach feels like the right one for a true-life saga of such absurd outrageous proportions. In film after film Russell doesnt just flirt with disaster but courts it openly positioning his characters in precarious pinball-like configurations and letting them fly his sympathies alighting on each of these lovable losers in turn. (There are no heroes or villains here and no dominant protagonist either as evidenced by the way the voiceover keeps shifting from one character to the next.) A bromance of sorts brews between Carmine and Irving who feels guilty about setting up his new friend for a nasty public fall especially as the unsuspecting mayor unwittingly does the same for his high-ranking pals. Meanwhile Sydney and Rosalyn clash over Irving (in a memorably heated faceoff that stops just short of a catfight) even as Sydney finds herself mysteriously drawn toward Richie. But the sexual tension between federal agent and femme fatale is held in check by their mutual distrust each suspecting the other may be playing them for a fool -- a push-pull dynamic that makes ""American Hustle"" among other things a heartfelt inquiry into the allure of false fronts and the universal need to be loved for ones true self. In that respect theres a dash of Preston Sturges ""The Lady Eve"" (Adams on-and-off British accent plays like an homage to Barbara Stanwyck) in a picture that otherwise suggests an Altmanesque spin on ""The Sting."" If the result can feel like as much of a mess as that description implies its a rich glorious mess and its underlying craftsmanship is apparent in the characters beautifully delineated relationships each with its own jangly rhythm and distinct feel. Much of the credit goes to the actors at the core of the ensemble delivering performances with the improvisatory swing and expert timing of a great jazz quintet. Bale who drastically slimmed down to play boxer Dicky Edlund in ""The Fighter"" has gone to the opposite extreme here packing on a few pounds and looking almost unrecognizable behind his aviator sunglasses and unflattering combover. Showing a warm and surprising restraint in the role of a madly inventive grifter henpecked husband and loving adoptive father (to Rosalyns son) the actor is increasingly called upon to fill the storys moral center as the stakes and shenanigans around him escalate. As Irvings rival captor and ally Cooper (whom Russell cant resist showing with his hair full of pink curlers) gives a bristling energetic turn that makes clear Richies own love for the swindle while Adams holds her own as the shrewd yet vulnerable scammer whose emotional indecision plays a crucial role in the storys twisty outcome. As the films biggest patsy (modeled on former Camden mayor Angelo Errichetti) Renner in his best performance since ""The Town"" looks and sounds every inch the well-liked well-fed Joisey Eyetalian. If Russell wraps up this big show with more flair than finesse the craft contributions boast plenty of panache including Linus Sandgrens fluid mobile widescreen camerawork and the dynamic editing by Jay Cassidy Crispin Struthers and Alan Baumgarten always finding interesting visual and rhythmic entry points into a scene. From the mens plaid sports jackets and honkin bowties to the shimmery plunging-neckline number worn by Adams in a crucial sequence Wilkinsons fantastic costumes revel in the possibilities of the milieu. But nothing sets the mood as thoroughly as the soundtrack overflowing with jazz standards and 70s hits and at one point using Elton Johns ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" to particularly hypnotic effect. The picture establishes a playful attitude toward its own period stylings at the outset with not just a restored 1978 Columbia logo but also amusingly trippy faux-gos created for Atlas Entertainment and Annapurna Pictures.

And were looking at Lawrences creamy white body - THIS is how she steals everything. Very entertaining nonetheless. Reply Usagi says December 31 2013 at 350 am I think it was a great film but I think critics over-hyped it. They made it sound as though Jennifer was going to be the scene stealer. I was sitting there waiting for her to grab my attention but instead of being amazed I was just annoyed by her character. Despite it being boring at times they made up for it by being funny. Adams and Bale were awesome. Reply tommyflorida says December 20 2013 at 631 pm Good review. American Hustle is a comedic tragedy - getting up close and personal to mirror how tragic we each are. Plenty of one and two shots - holding us close to the characters in play. While I felt the use of Elton Johns Goodbye Yellow Brick Road was somewhat forced the opening Duke Ellington party scene where Bale and Adams first meet was delghtfully tense and nearly breathtaking. Very good scene. Reply Percy Dovetonsils says December 17 2013 at 306 pm Justin You seem to be the only critic reviewing AMERICAN HUSTLE who picked up on Adams and Russells nod to THE LADY EVE (even Sydneys moniker Lady Edith.) Nicely done. Reply Justin Chang says December 17 2013 at 736 pm Many thanks Percy.

Reply R.E. says December 9 2013 at 803 pm I cant wait to see this movie I LOVE the entire cast - I feel like this could be a classic. Reply The CineDouche says December 8 2013 at 833 am Saw the pic at a screening last night in NYC with the director and entire cast present for a discussion afterward. Justin Chang perfectly hits all the pros and cons here. Excellent review of a fun brilliantly acted film that has wacky characters bad hair and all the plaid and garishness of the 70s. Reply Ron Kolb says December 5 2013 at 1247 pm The real story of Abscam is not deliriously funny but quite tragic. The review mentions Mel Weinberg who happens to be involved with this film but neglects to mention his wife Marie Weinberg whom the thinly-veiled Rosalyn character is based. Marie had come forward and exposed Weinbergs misdeeds during Abscam on national TV and then after having received weeks of both public and private harassment and intimidation primarily from her husband apparently chose to take her own life. Thirty years ago the movie about the likable conman had failed to materialize until now. Reply Am says December 4 2013 at 917 pm Finally a serious review. And for anyone who thinks this is some kind of a wild endorsement (like the people over at Metacritic and some of the folks in this thread) youre deranged. So much confusion in the critical community. Its probably not that difficult. Objectively Id guess the classics from around this time will be simply Wolf of Wall Street Nymphomaniac (for technical achievement only not really a classic) Gravity and for screenwriting sophistication Blue Jasmine. There are other smaller ones that will surface over the years Im sure. But as for mainstream... Case closed. Damn. Reply LOL says December 4 2013 at 1158 am This review is a mess. One cant tell if the reviewer liked the movie despite its flaws or if the flaws are the very reasons why the film works so well. Perhaps the reviewer is insinuating that American Hustle is a magnificent mess of a movie? Reply D says December 4 2013 at 152 pm Yes indeed David O. Russells movies are always a beautiful mess in a sense that every character is flawed theyre never 100% likable. Theyre all struggling to survive. Russell is really showing you a picture about people trying to survive people facing society. You have to remember that when DOR writes his scripts theyre never the same when he shoots them. In the original script Jennifers character Roselyn was originally named Estelle and only had about 4 scenes and not much dialogue but because DOR likes to improvise and add on to the movie her character was expanded and layered. In the script she was never portrayed as crazy. She was just a housewife redecorating her home taking care of her son and she was completely unaware of her husbands affair until the end. But DOR films blossom into something bigger. The critic really liked the film and the performances he was only explaining to you that you have to look beyond the flaws of the characters but also morals. Reply LOL says December 5 2013 at 131 pm Sir I stand corrected. Thank you for breaking it down for me. Now I need some elucidation on the reviewers suggestion that Jennifer Lawrence is the one who feels like the purest embodiment of Russells ethos especially when I just read a report questioning her movie star statushttp//movies-on-my-mind.blogspot.co.uk/2013/12/is-jennifer-lawrence-movie-star.html Lulu says December 4 2013 at 1037 am I was already very eager to see AH but after reading this (incredible) review I may need a 70s-type relaxing agent. Cant wait. Reply Silvana says December 4 2013 at 1017 am This film is been overrateed for many critics. And all the performances are overacted all. Please critics from US better taste please dont buy so quickly. Reply FTCS says December 4 2013 at 1244 pm Silvana Dont know where you are from but the critical praise for the actors is not only justified...it is just the beginning...watch how many acting nominations and wins these performances will garner here and abroad. And Silvana they are all well deserved. Reply FTCS says December 5 2013 at 803 am Whatever. This isnt a debate about awards. It is a debate about American Hustle being that good. And in this case its recognition will be earned and not some AMPAS anomaly or error or political statement. So your point is just not relevant to American Hustle which I doubt you have even seen. Have you? Am says December 4 2013 at 1019 pm Yes because nominations and wins are always indicative of a films true value.

Daily Edition Login to download American Hustle Film Review 900 AM PST 12/4/2013 by David Rooney FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS An infectious blast of funky jazz played by a terrific cast and a director at the top of their respective games. TWITTER David O. Russell reunites with Christian Bale Amy Adams Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence in this 70s-set tale of con artists roped into a corruption crackdown along with the directors new recruit Jeremy Renner. In The Fighter and Silver Linings Playbook David O. Russell hit a bracing mid-career groove in which his idiosyncratic stamp as a director injected distinctive rawness and emotional vitality into what in other hands might have been merely conventional movies. He continues on that roll of refreshing character-driven storytelling with the outrageously entertaining American Hustle a twisty con-job chronicle that combines heightened dramatic stakes with playful humor subversive sexiness and fabulous 1970s style. Fueled by invigorating performances from a zesty ensemble often cast against type this looks like a winner for Sony. Written by Eric Warren Singer and Russell the film is a fictionalized account of the Abscam scandal an East Coast FBI sting operation that went down in the late 70s and early 80s. It resulted in a number of public officials being convicted on corruption charges including several congressmen and high-level political operatives. PHOTOS American Hustle Premiere As indicated by the opening tag ""Some of this actually happened"" Russell makes no claim of adhering to those events. He carries on exploring the affinity evident in his last two features for characters at difficult junctures working to reinvent themselves. What gives this film its teasing pleasure is that almost everyone on both sides of the law is to some extent an ambiguous hustler promising one thing and delivering another sometimes with multiple hidden agendas. The vicarious enjoyment of being bad that American Hustle provides gives it a vague kinship with Goodfellas while its buoyant narrative energy and disco-era setting recall Boogie Nights. Dexterously plotted and laced with choice dialogue the film is a crime drama infused with the spirit of a caper comedy its frisky insouciance at times not unlike Steven Soderberghs Oceans Eleven remake. Theres a lot of great hair in this movie but none more transfixing than the carefully sculpted comb-over worn by Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) which we watch him construct in a process involving glue a fake thatch and a thick coat of Elnett. That hilarious opening sequence also establishes the walking paradox of paunchy Irving whose personal style seems at odds with a breezy confidence that allows him to scam just about anyone. PHOTOS American Hustle Character Posters Plunge Us Into the Late 1970s Its precisely that quality that attracts Sydney (Amy Adams) a knockout former stripper from New Mexico who likes to pass herself off as Lady Edith a Brit with London banking connections. That alias comes in handy as the lovers lure patsies into a fake loan scheme collecting five grand a pop. But Sydney/Edith makes a bad call when she reels in Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) an ambitious Fed. He coerces Sydney and Irving into helping him nail some heavyweight white-collar targets promising that four significant arrests will clear their slate. Sydney wants to flee the country but Irving remains too tied to his messed-up manipulative wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) whose son from a previous relationship he has adopted. When Sydney informs Irv that she intends to get close to Richie for insurance she is acting out of jealousy as much as self-protection. They identify a likely mark in Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) a New Jersey mayor known as ""the working mans friend."" Frustrated at the difficulty of raising money to redevelop Atlantic City and eager to generate income and jobs for the state Carmine gets pulled into a web of bribery and corruption dragging other politicians in with him. Seed money from a fake Arab sheik (Michael Pena) serves as bait also drawing the interest of Florida-based Mobsters looking to grow their gambling empire. These are juicy garrulous characters and Russell has lovingly contoured them to fit actors who have been lucky charms for him in his recent work. As well as Bale and Adams from The Fighter and Cooper and Lawrence from Silver Linings Playbook another of that films alumni Robert De Niro turns up unbilled in an amusingly tense negotiation scene as a lieutenant of Meyer Lansky. New recruit Renner is a wonderful addition to this core group doing his best work since The Hurt Locker. STORY American Hustle Writer Stars Discuss How David O. Russell Shaped the Film Bale is outstanding his commitment to the central role going far beyond the weight gain and slouchy posture. Irving is an inscrutable shyster for sure but one with both a conscience (he balks at going after politicians while America is still hurting from the disillusionment of Watergate and Vietnam) and a complicated set of personal loyalties acutely revealed when he establishes a genuine friendship with Carmine. This helps makes Irv against all odds someone in whom we find ourselves investing. Russell has a knack for capturing the exhilarating moment in which the characters bonds are cemented - Irv and Carmine carousing to Tom Jones ""Delilah"" at the end of a boozy night out; Irv and Sydney dizzy in each others arms while the garment rack of a dry-cleaners store (one of his core legit businesses) whirls around them; Sydney and Richie boogieing on a dance-floor with a nod to the films title in a step or two of the Hustle. Sporting a ridiculous home perm and a Tony Manero wardrobe Cooper has never been funnier or more manic. Motor-mouth Richies anxiousness to avoid being trapped behind a desk leads him to all kinds of unwise decisions making him as shady as Irv or maybe more so. And Renner with a magnificent pompadour gives the film a welcome dose of poignancy. A breed of mensch rarely encountered in Irvs circle hes a thoroughly decent if somewhat gullible family man heartbroken to learn hes been nudged down the wrong path. As for the ladies Adams is sensational in rare bad-girl mode. Poured into costume designer Michael Wilkinsons deep-plunge disco gowns wrapped in a skimpy macrame swimsuit or a ton of fur she has the looks and the innate savvy of an operator more than capable of stringing along two men while keeping us guessing about her ultimate intentions. STORY David O. Russell Sneaks American Hustle First Scene at AFI Fest Says Everybody Plays Against Type The films stealth weapon however is Lawrence. Hot off The Hunger Games Catching Fire she steals every scene in her limited screen time. Whether blithely blowing up a microwave or lip-syncing to ""Live and Let Die"" while furiously doing some housecleaning Rosalyn is dangerously off-kilter but also shrewd; shes both kitten and tigress. Crowned by an updo of cascading curls shes a sublime modern take on a quintessential screwball figure never at fault in her own mind no matter how badly she blunders. Her ladies-room confrontation with Sydney is among the films high points. Down to the smallest roles this is a brilliantly cast movie full of incisive characterizations the most notable of them from Louis C.K. as Richies by-the-book FBI supervisor Stoddard Thorsen. While the comic was underused in Blue Jasmine the prickly exchanges between Stoddard and his increasingly out-of-control agent are gems particularly when Stoddards glory-hound boss (Alessandro Nivola) starts undermining him. Russell and cinematographer Linus Sandgren dont go in for lots of fancy camera moves instead keeping the sharp widescreen compositions firmly focused on the characters. Similarly period recreation from production designer Judy Becker and costumer Wilkinson is richly detailed and loaded with trashy-flashy glamor without drawing attention away from the players. Three editors Jay Cassidy Crispin Struthers and Alan Baumgarten are credited with compressing the lively story and its multiple character arcs into two-hours-twenty that never drags. Even at its most chaotic the narrative remains fluid. A key element is the energizing use of music perfectly attuned to every turn the action takes. Danny Elfmans cool connective score follows the lead of the Duke Ellington number ""Jeeps Blues"" smoothly integrated into a killer collection of cocktail tunes brassy jazz and primo 70s nuggets that includes tracks from Chicago America Jeff Lynne Steely Dan Donna Summer Elton John David Bowie and the Bee Gees. Oh and extra points for using the Harold Melvin amp; The Blue Notes original of ""Dont Leave Me This Way"" instead of the heard-to-death Thelma Houston redo.

In the case of ""American Hustle"" however I will say that this latest triumph from director and co-writer David O. Russell has the kind of throbbing pulse wicked snap and sheer moviemaking bravado that makes it one of a very few films that can be mentioned in the same breath as that earlier classic. As with his previous gem ""Silver Linings Playbook"" Russell takes an idea that on paper absolutely shouldnt work -- four different unreliable narrators guide us through a funhouse version of the ABSCAM entrapment scheme -- and makes it fly. More than that actually he makes it loop-de-loop and zoom to the clouds and buzz the tops of trees. The movie opens with a pot-bellied Christian Bale elaborately gluing a toupee to his head and fluffing his comb-over around it and for the next two-plus hours ""American Hustle"" maintains that level of outrageous watchability. Bale plays Irving Rosenfeld a dry-cleaner who runs successful art-forgery and personal-loan scams on the side. We see him fall madly in love with Sydney (Amy Adams) a self-made woman who shares his gift for fakery. See video Christian Bale Amy Adams Plot Their Best Con Ever in New American Hustle Trailer Despite the deepness of their bond all is not well. For one thing Irvings got a wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) whom he calls ""the Picasso of passive-aggressive."" (Indeed at one point Irving confronts Rosalyn over blurting out information that could cost him his life and by the end of the conversation hes thanking her for it.) Rosalyn has a son whom Irving has adopted and she uses the boy to hang on to her man refusing to grant him a divorce. Irvings bigger headache is Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) an FBI agent who has busted Sydney and Irving on one of their scams and is now forcing them to use their skills at duplicity to nab him some bigger fish. What starts out as a straightforward bust against beloved Camden N.J. mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) whom Richie hopes to nab skimming a percentage of the money going into the construction of Atlantic City casinos gets out of control very quickly. Before long Richies fake investment scheme is taking in not only congressmen and senators but also hardcore mobsters the ones who arent going to play nice when this shell game eventually blows up. ""American Hustle"" forces us to change our affiliations constantly Does Irving deserve Sydney? Is Sydney falling for Richie or merely playing him? Is Carmine really a good guy at heart? Is Richie more duplicitous than the fraudsters he prosecutes? Does Rosalyn deserve happiness and will she ever use a microwave oven without burning down the house? Also read Jennifer Lawrence Steals the Show in American Hustle First Screening Russell and Eric Singers whiz-bang script makes us wait for the answers but part of what makes ""American Hustle"" so great is its ability like its characters to juggle multiple identities simultaneously. Its a character piece a thriller a dark comedy and a con game all rolled in one playing genre against genre in a way thats riveting from start to finish. Russell never plays the Carter-era excess for laughs but he and his crew get the 1970s look just right summoning yellows and browns and greens that havent been seen on film since ""Good Times"" went off the air. And fitting perfectly among the flocked wallpaper and turntables is his extraordinary ensemble cast. Bale has never been funnier but he never plays his chubby and be-wigged sleazeball for easy laughs. We see why his and Adams character go completely gaga for each other but their portrayals dont condescend; for all their aspirations and lapses in taste they are the lids to each others pots. (After all hes a British actor playing American and shes playing an American who occasionally lapses into a hilariously iffy British accent as part of her crooked persona.) Also read Jennifer Lawrence Amy Adams Dazzle in American Hustle Character Posters (Photos) And its not just the reuniting stars of ""The Fighter"" that excel here; so do ""Silver Linings"" vets Cooper and Lawrence playing outsized eccentrics that could have been two-dimensional twits in lesser hands. (Lawrence also manages to give Adams a run for her money in Michael Wilkinsons flashy cleavage-riffic costumes.) Renners terrific too as a family man whose veneer of charm might hide some dark corners or shockingly genuine goodness. Russell is one of this generations great directors of actors and his entire ensemble is a thrill to watch down to the walk-ons. (There are two immensely satisfying supporting turns from actors whose identity you should allow to be a surprise.) Any number of movies have attempted to mimic the style and content of films by 70s mavericks like Scorsese and Robert Altman but rather than quote the masters Russell instead channels their bravado their chutzpah and their love of working without a net. The result is one of 2013s most memorable movies one thats strong enough to have been one of 1979s best as well. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Russells American Hustle Is Snazzy And Fun -- With a Purpose Review David O. Russells American Hustle Is Snazzy And Fun -- With a Purpose Eric Kohn Dec 4 2013 1200 pm erickohn Share This Article Pin It Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Print Talk ""Some of this actually happened"" reads the opening credit of David O. Russells ""American Hustle"" although it could equally apply to any of the filmmakers previous works. Russells freewheeling approach to portraying downtrodden Americans fighting to achieve small personal victories pervades his movies so comprehensively that they may as well exist in his own invented universe. Yet they also maintain a heightened realism through Russells caustic loose screenplays which rely on high energy performances that allows the humanity of his characters to hover over the material and transcend its fixed ingredients. They arent just the stars of the show -- they steal it which makes this tale of con artists in the late seventies into ideal turf for Russell to run wild. Needless to say story comes second to Russell over the rhythms of well-timed bickering which is a blessing and a curse in ""American Hustle"" A confident polished work its also a tangled caper about criminals and the FBI enmeshed in a convoluted scheme thats beside the point -- and yet with its 137 minute running time theres so much of plotting that sometimes the movie seems as though its engaged in the same identity crisis assailing its leads. But the Frankenstein narrative holds a unique allure. Before anyone in ""American Hustle"" starts talking Russell gives us a single cogent image Conman Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) glaring at himself in a hotel mirror packing a significant paunch his hair jutting upward from a bald scalp as he prepares to apply an unruly combover. The actors barely recognizable and becomes increasingly buried in the performance as he awkwardly wrestles with his hairpiece establishing the slapstick tone and the storys main theme with a single comic bit. Set in New Jersey in 1978 ""American Hustle"" is all about people wearing costumes literally and otherwise to hide their agendas. Building on a screenplay originally written by Eric Singer Russell uses as a foundation the famous FBI Congressional corruption probe Abscam in which federal agents worked with con artist Mel Weinberg to ensnare politicians accepting bribes. The plan was too ambitious for its own good partly because it stemmed from the daring objective of a reckless federal agent mainly intent on landing his own victories. In ""American Hustle"" that role falls to a wide-eyed Bradley Cooper as agent Richie DiMaso who forces Rosenfeld and his partner Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) to help the FBI with his ambush plans after he busts the couple for running a phony investment firm. But ""American Hustle"" starts after these pieces have already been put in motion The couple have begrudgingly started working for DiMaso to capture the local mayor (Jeremy Renner) accepting a bribe. When it flashes back to explain how they got there Russell hesitates focusing instead on the courtship between Rosenfeld and Prosser a passionate young woman with a vague origin story drawn to Rosenfelds confidence (if not his body type). Its only once their get-rich-quick plot takes off that DiMaso enters the picture and ensnares them in an even riskier gamble. By then its practically irrelevant. While peppered with multiple voiceovers to display various perspectives on the situation nobody comments much on the actual plan of offering false bribes to politicians for casino licenses. When Prosser describes Rosenfelds allure she says that hes ""so careful and precise about every stylistic detail"" an observation that could apply to their eventual scams -- but doesnt. ""American Hustle"" is predominantly concerned with the personalities of its ensemble ahead of their specific actions. But thats not to say the actual scam doesnt hold some appeal. In some ways a companion piece to last years ""Argo"" -- another fluffy late seventies-set tale of a complicated government-funded ploy -- ""American Hustle"" delves into agent DiMasos plan by taking cues from his excitement over it. Battling out his intentions with a bumbling superior (Louis C.K. in typically amusing deadpan mode) DiMaso sets his sights on a well-intentioned mayor (Jeremy Renner) interested in the casino deal in the hopes that it can aid other forms of urban development. The entrapment plan gets increasingly thorny once Rosenfeld befriends the mayor; meanwhile his female partner sets her sights on seducing the agent forcing them to go through with his ploy leading to mixed results for everyone involved. Its certainly amusing to watch Russell stack the deck with a half dozen disconnected story ingredients and wait for the entire house of cards to crumble. But Russell is more concerned with the nimble process off putting it together than pulling it apart. By the time the team has cast a fake Arab sheik (Michael Pena in a cheeky cameo) and managed a meeting with a major Jersey crime lord (another cheeky cameo best left as a surprise) its clear that nobody really understands what theyre doing least of all the man responsible for it all. As DiMaso Cooper offers up a more enterprising riff on the irascible head case he played in Russells ""Silver Linings Playbook"" with bigger plans but the same wild impulsiveness. While just as much of a hot head Rosenfeld has a better grasp on the situation and understands how to use DiMasos hubris to his advantage. As they argue about practical challenges more meaningful issues awkwardly bubble up. ""Were all conning each other one way or another just to get through life"" Rosenfeld explains in voiceover. As it careeners into its final act ""American Hustle"" makes that point a bit too bluntly and by the time it arrives at certain big reveals theyve been a long time coming. The giddy vitality of Russells cast cant always overcome the redundancies of its pace and it often has the slack qualities of an overindulgent acting exercise. But what an exercise. Much has already been made about Jennifer Lawrences show-stealing performance as Rosenfelds estranged wife Rosalyn a booze-guzzling hot-tempered troublemaker who one-ups Melissa Leo in ""The Fighter"" as the most spectacular female presence in the pantheon of Russells creations. Described by Rosenfeld as ""the Picasso of passive-aggressive karate"" Rosalyn has a near-psychotic demeanor that makes everyone around her look largely restrained and in this movie thats saying something. In light of the ferocity that she brings to the role Adams performance as the other woman in Rosenfelds life has a far more subdued quality that never manages the same definition achieved by the rest of the cast. Overstatement is everything in ""American Hustle"" and overwhelms the subtler ingredients of its atmosphere. Even the soundtrack a constant bombardment of hits from the likes of Duke Ellington Donna Summer and Tom Jones often jumps into the center of the action. Even so the blithe dimensions of its world cant obscure the storys legitimate focus on disgruntled romantics grappling with the conundrums keeping them down. By making this struggle go down so easy Russell turns the pursuit of the American dream into the ultimate escapism. Despite the flashy period details ""American Hustle"" maintains an appeal thats resolutely modern. Criticwire Grade B+ HOW WILL IT PLAY? Sony releases ""American Hustle"" in New York and L.A. on December 13th ahead of a nationwide expansion on December 18th. A combination of strong critical support and the appeal of its cast should propel to strong returns through the New Year and it should remain a major player in the awards season in several categories.
