Starring Hilary Swank Chloe Sevigny Peter Sarsgaard Brendan Sexton III. Directed by Kimberly Peirce. (R. 114 minutes.) One knows going in that ""Boys Dont Cry"" a dramatized look at the short life of Nebraska teenage transvestite Teena Brandon is going to be a tragic film. But almost nothing prepares the viewer for the shock of what happens even in the films superbly delineated ""white trash"" world shaded by a sense of desperation. That this story is based on real lives and an actual crime that occurred in 1993 only adds a chilling weight to what becomes a very American tragedy. It may be the best-acted film of the year. In an Oscar-winning performance Hilary Swank the bony actress who plays Teena Brandon passes herself off as a swaggering boy named Brandon Teena. She is a he not just in the way he dresses but in the way he moves speaks gestures jokes. Swanks performance crosses into a realm of veracity rare in film acting. If Swank were alone in giving an outstanding performance that would be enough. But ""Boys Dont Cry"" is unusually rich in them Peter Sarsgaard as the creepy doped-up John Lotter (the real Lotter is now on death row); Brendan Sexton III as his sadistic accomplice Tom Nissen; and Chloe Sevigny as Lana Tisdel the sexually adventurous young woman who became Brandons lover because he was like no other boy she had ever kissed. This is a grim film and a shocker. It contains extremely graphic depictions filled with maniacal abandon of a rape and a murder. ..

Though six years have passed since the brutal rape and murder of Teena Brandon the complex protagonist of Kimberly Peirces superlative dramatic feature ""Boys Dont Cry"" the story has grown only more compelling and relevant. This devastatingly powerful tale of a young girl who disguised herself as a boy is anchored by two fully realized performances by Hilary Swank as the sexual misfit and Chloe Sevigny as her sensitive girlfriend. Audacious accomplished pic should play well with open minded viewers seeking edgy mature fare. Fox Searchlight release could become one of the most talked about indies of the year although a major marketing challenge rests in pushing it beyond the urban specialized niche to reach young and sophisticated viewers generally when it opens in October. The films richly dense narrative touches on many controversial and timely issues -- the nature of sexual identity biology vs. sociology in gender construction role playing in modern life -- as well as offering a perceptive anatomy of homophobia and intolerance in the American heartland. Bold and for the most part uncompromising ""Boys"" reps a breath of fresh air at a time when most American indies have gotten too soft and too close to the mainstream. Mixing fiction and nonfiction elements freely but astutely in relating the life of Brandon Teena (nee Teena Brandon) -- who was the subject of a 1998 documentary ""The Brandon Teena Story"" -- Peirce and Andy Bienens multilayered script is inspired by the literary journalism of Truman Capote (""In Cold Blood"") and Norman Mailer (""The Executioners Song"") and by such uniquely American crimers as ""Bonnie and Clyde"" and ""Badlands"" rural sagas that viewed their subjects from a chillingly detached perspective. At the most obvious level ""Boys Dont Cry"" tells a tender love story between two outcasts who are stuck in crude and stifling surroundings. Its a tribute to the filmmakers intelligence that they dont offer simplistic psychological explanations for the ""bizarre and deviant"" conduct of Brandon Teena. Nor do they mythologize her. Set in 1993 story begins in Lincoln Neb. with the 20-year-old Brandon (Swank) getting a boyish haircut and preparing for a night out dressed in blue jeans flannel shirt and boots. Though warned by cousin Lonny (Matt McGrath) that ""his"" behavior signals big trouble and ""folks in Falls City kill fags"" Brandon insists that her life -- now his life -- is on the right track. Brandon arrives in Falls City as a bright newcomer who enchants all those who meet him. Soon he establishes himself as a playful rebel a sensitive and loyal friend and an irresistible romantic who seduces lonely innocent and underprivileged beauties. At a local bar Brandon befriends Candace (Alicia Goranson) a young single mom who invites him to move into her place. But as soon as he lays his eyes on the sexually appealing Lana (Sevigny) its love at first sight. First reel unfolds as a series of rites of passage with Brandon making every effort to be accepted by a group of men (all ex cons) headed by the macho John (Peter Sarsgaard) whos the lover of Lanas mom (Jeannetta Arnette) and infatuated with Lana and his younger brutish companion Tom (Brendan Sexton III). The clique which functions as a fractured extended family spends its time boozing smoking and partying. The sharp writing and nuanced acting pull the viewer into this tale of the double life of a fun loving heartbreaker. In several revealing scenes Peirce documents what it means -- and what it physically takes -- to be dressed and behave as a boy while trapped in a womans body. Second act centers on the tender love relationship that evolves between Brandon and Lana their first date initial kiss and outdoor lovemaking which is crosscut with Lana recounting the experience to her curious friends. It is in these sequences that the neophyte Peirce reveals herself to be a deft helmer of emotionally complex and tension ridden situations. Turning point occurs when Brandon is thrown into the womens section of the local jail for cumulative traffic offenses and Lana comes to visit him. Confronted Brandon contends that hes a case of ""sexual identity crisis"" born with some male and some female parts. With total understanding and unshattered belief Lana continues the affair which leads to a big party for Brandons 21st birthday at her house. Midsection is repetitive and plods a bit (a few minutes of cutting would be beneficial) but last reel is extremely powerful in chronicling the rednecks reaction when a local newspaper breaks Brandons story. In a brutally harsh series of events John and Tom strip beat and rape Brandon. Last act depicting Brandons murder in a ramshackle farmhouse is almost too painful to watch. Stunningly accomplished in every department this first film boasts sharp cinematography by Jim Denault and flawless acting by the ensemble with the two young leads contributing their best perfs to date and Sarsgaard Sexton and Arnette also impressing strongly. The poignant and candid ""Boys Dont Cry"" can be seen as a ""Rebel Without a Cause"" for these culturally diverse and complex times with the two misfit girls enacting a version of the James Dean - Natalie Wood romance with utmost conviction searching like their 50s counterparts for love self-worth and a place to call home.

Teenas desire to be male driven as it is by psychosexual identity confusions is also her way of throwing off the last shackles of American girlhood -- an act of reckless self-creation destined to end in darkness. The extraordinary Hilary Swank makes Brandon/Teena by the end seem beyond male or female. Its as if we were simply glimpsing the characters soul in all its yearning and conflicted beauty.

"Boys Dont Cry | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; boys-don-t-cry ) Boys Dont Cry (United States 1999) A movie review by James Berardinelli On December 30 1993 in Falls City Nebraska two men John Lotter and Tom Nissen shot and killed 21-year old Teena Brandon along with two of her friends Lisa Lambert and Philip Devine. Brandon a young woman undergoing hormone therapy in preparation for a sex change operation had been living as a man (""Brandon Teena"") for a number of years and had presented herself as such to Lotter and Nissen with whom she became friendly. When they learned the truth they reacted violently humiliating Brandon in front of his girlfriend Lana then kidnapping and raping her. After Brandon reported the incident to the police Lotter and Nissen resorted to murder. Because of the lurid details surrounding the case (sex lesbianism a woman masquerading as a man) the ""Teena Brandon/Brandon Teena murder"" fed national news headlines so theres not much mystery about how Boys Dont Cry a slightly fictionalized account of the story ends. The fascination with the tragic film is in seeing how the situation develops. For the most part Kimberly Pierces debut feature sticks close to the facts as set forth in the 1998 documentary The Brandon Teena Story Susan Muska and Greta Olafsdottirs amateurish-but-powerful exposA(c) of the events leading up to the triple slaying. Changes have been made (for example there are two victims instead of three and the dead girls name is Candace not Lisa) but most of the events and characters are accurately presented. Certainly none of the factual alterations dilutes or diminishes the films brutal impact. For me because of its intense emotional savageness this is the second most difficult 1999 motion picture to sit through (the only one tougher is Tim Roths devastating The War Zone). It is not intended for those who are unwilling to confront the visceral results of intolerance and hatred. Pierce does not spare her audience anything - we see in graphic detail every indignity and torment visited upon Brandon once the truth of his gender becomes common knowledge. Those who cannot stomach these scenes will find Boys Dont Cry to be virtually unwatchable; those who can will be rewarded with a potent movie-going experience. Most of the action takes place in the small town of Falls City. In his 1998 review of The Brandon Teena Story in The New York Times Stephen Holden describes the community this way ""Falls City an economically depressed small town with an all-white population of just under 5000 epitomizes that sprawling rural and semi-rural section of the United States that might be described as the Land of the Pickup Truck. Those who live and work here may have heard of gay liberation but theyve never met an uncloseted gay or transgendered person and have no desire to do so. Although Falls City prides itself on being a close-knit God-fearing community we learn that it has a high rate of domestic violence."" This is the unpromising oasis where Teena Brandon (calling herself Brandon Teena) arrives with the hope of finding acceptance and friendship. For a while she has both but once the secret of her identity is revealed Brandon discovers how fast things can change. The violence of her so-called friends reactions makes a horrific statement about the deep-seated vein of homophobia that characterizes many rural Midwestern communities. Lotter and Nissen are the only convicted killers but they are aided and abetted by Lanas mother the local sheriff (who treats Brandon the victim like some kind of sick twisted criminal) and most of the other ""good"" citizens of Falls City. And the responses of people in this town are not unique - the same feelings and beliefs can be found in numerous locales all across the country. The 1998 slaying of Matthew Shepard a gay man beaten to death by homophobic thugs reminded us once more that the hatred directed at Brandon is not isolated. Part of the reason for the success of Boys Dont Cry is the acting. The cast which is comprised primarily of actors who have made their marks in small low-budget features is nearly perfect. The lions share of the praise goes to Hilary Swank who with her hair cut short and her chest wrapped bears a remarkable resemblance to the real individual as seen in The Brandon Teena Story. Swank (The Next Karate Kid Heartwood) gives the performance of her career here. This is raw courageous work that draws the audience in. We feel Brandons confusion uncertainty and alienation. Swanks portrayal makes the final twenty minutes almost unbearable. The supporting actors are more than capable. ChloA<< Sevigny (The Last Days of Disco) plays Lana an affection-starved young woman with such a low sense of self-esteem that she deludes herself into believing that Brandon is actually a man even after a sexual encounter. Sevignys performance is more conventional than Swanks but no less effective. She provides the counterbalance to the tide of hatred that drowns the last act of the film. Even after Lana is forced to confront the truth she will not abandon her lover. Peter Sarsgaard and Brendan Sexton III (both recently seen in Desert Blue) play Lotter and Nissen as typical redneck ""good ole boys"" (right out of Deliverance). The most chilling thing about these two characters is that some people in this country regard them as heroes. Sitting in a theater watching Boys Dont Cry is like observing a speeding train rushing headlong towards a certain crash. The ending a matter of recent historical record assures that there will be no room for an upbeat twist. We view events with a growing sense of discomfort as the inevitable catastrophe looms nearer. In her script and with her direction Pierce has taken pains to avoid even the slightest hint of exploitation and sensationalization. Ultimately she tells a story of great human tragedy - one that has happened before and is almost certain to be repeated more than once in the years to come. What human beings do not understand they destroy.
