A classic ready-made for the era of big-budget 3D spectacle gets the least classy treatment imaginable in ""Gullivers Travels"" a loose lowest-common-denominator retelling of Jonathan Swifts mock travelogue that drops a giant loser in the land of the little people. Rather than exploiting the scenarios obvious cinematic possibilities director Rob Letterman permits Jack Blacks already larger-than-life persona to dwarf everything else in sight letting this sad-sack Gulliver fulfill whatever fantasies he was denied in the real world -- an angle more appealing to disenfranchised 7-year-olds than for those buying the tickets. Fox has big hopes but should expect only medium-sized returns. Where the source novel used wit -- and a fair amount of off-color humor -- to comment on the attitudes and behaviors of its time this offputting update offers no such insights. Instead it lifts a few choice details from the first book of Swifts four-part satire (including an incident in which Gulliver extinguishes a fire by emptying his bladder on the blaze) and rounding out the rest with sheer silliness. Blacks lovable-slob shtick carried ""School of Rock"" and subsequent kiddie fare but his Gulliver comes across as considerably less appealing. A self-absorbed manchild whose lack of hygiene is matched only by his lack of ambition Gulliver toils in the mailroom of a Gotham newspaper where he harbors a not-so-secret crush on travel editor Darcy Silverman (Amanda Peet). Too nervous to ask her out he instead accepts an assignment traveling to the Bermuda Triangle where strange weather conditions (a vortex that reps the first of the films mediocre visual effects) transport him to the land of Lilliput. Gulliver awakens tied to the ground by men no taller than toy soldiers in a grotesque parody of the books most iconic scene one that presents the pot-bellied Black looking like a beached whale amid the tiny Lilliputians. Rather than modernizing the race of mini-men to poke fun at our own small-mindedness screenwriters Joe Stillman and Nicholas Stoller present them as broad parodies of the 18th-century court with the countrys hapless King Theodore (Billy Connolly) and sniveling Gen. Edward (Chris ODowd) engaged in ongoing war with their equally ridiculous rivals the Blefuscians. Though distrusted at first Gulliver proves invaluable in defending the kingdom putting that blubber to good use deflecting microscopic cannonballs. As a reward Gulliver is granted full use of the Lilliputian workforce which he employs in the most self-serving manner possible within the bounds of a PG rating re-creating the glories of his Gotham lifestyle to suit his newly inflated ego which involves the little folks constructing everything from a Sphinx-scale La-Z-Boy chair to a miniature version of Times Square featuring Gulliver-themed billboards. If this spin on Swifts tale sounds disappointingly cartoonish that conceivably owes to the combined sensibilities of Black and director Letterman a veteran of such DreamWorks Animation pics as ""Shark Tale"" and ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" (the latter involving a similar challenge juggling characters of wildly different scales). Like a number of animation helmers before him Letterman struggles in the live-action medium. He seems overwhelmed by the visual effects challenges clumsily moving from scene to scene and unable to marshal unity among the performances. Black runs wild opposite ODowds more mannered comic turn while co-stars Emily Blunt and Jason Segel grapple awkwardly with a distracting romantic subplot. The story grows more desperate as it goes on squeezing in a visit to the super-sized land of Brobdingnag and an inexplicable robot battle en route to a goofy cover of Edwin Starrs anti-Vietnam anthem ""War."" With its wacky accents and silly shenanigans ""Gullivers Travels"" could have been ""Time Bandits"" for a new generation but instead feels like ""Attack of the 50-Foot Couch Potato."" Although a tilt-shift opening credits sequence cleverly makes Manhattan look like a scale model the rest of David Tattersalls lensing is bland relying heavily on a ""DualMoCo"" camera system which enabled such innovations as the sight of a three-inch man disappearing inside Blacks butt crack. Rather than enhancing the dramatic size differences the addition of 3D merely draws attention to pics heavy use of greenscreen. Fox bolsters the features anemic running time with a three-minute short ""Scrats Continental Crack-Up"" which amusingly reveals how the ""Ice Age"" squirrels insatiable acorn lust split apart Pangaea.

The story Black plays a would-be journalist who lands on the island of Lilliput in search of a story in this updated 3-D take on the classic Jonathan Swift tale. Starring Jack Black Jason Segel Emily Blunt Billy Connelly Amanda Peet Catherine Tate James Corden Olly Alexander Director Rob Letterman Release Opened Dec 25 2010  Editorial Review Minuscule laughsBy Michael OSullivanSaturday December 25 2010Imagine a contemporary update of ""Gullivers Travels"" in which the titular hero - an unambitious pop-culture addict played by Jack Black - finds himself in a Lilliput whose pinkie-size denizens are only too willing to place themselves at his beck and call. What if this slacker were thrown into a miniature pre-industrial society filled with industrious and highly trainable workers - literally the size of worker bees - who were able to replicate through ingenuity and effort an elaborate if slightly low-tech simulacrum of the world that Gulliver left behind? A world of Guitar Hero and ""Star Wars"" DVDs? Of La-Z-Boy recliners and grande lattes built not to their scale but to his? That might be kind of neat and sort of funny. The new ""Gullivers Travels"" is not that movie. For a brief shining moment or two theres a suggestion that it might just be headed in that direction. But then the movie takes a sharp turn heads due south and never comes back. In this unnecessary and unfunny re-imagining of the classic satire by Jonathan Swift Lemuel Gulliver (Black) finds himself on the aforementioned island of tiny people while researching a travel article on the Bermuda Triangle. Hes not actually a writer but a worker in a newspaper mail room who has finagled the assignment by lying to a cute editor he likes named Darcy (Amanda Peet). Initially Gulliver is captured and imprisoned. But after extinguishing a raging fire by urinating on it - and collaterally on several Lilliputians - hes quickly declared a hero. (Just imagine that scene. On second thought dont. If it sounds funny to you youll probably love the one where Gulliver accidentally sits on a Lilliputian after losing his pants. I cant do it justice in a family newspaper. But I will tell you theres a cast credit for a character described only as ""Butt-crack man."" Consider yourself warned.) In short order Gulliver is living in a beach-front contemporary drinking fresh coffee out of a Rube Goldberg contraption maintained by a small army of Lilliputians and watching live performances of his favorite shows and movies (""Star Wars"" ""Titanic"" ""24"") that he has trained the Lilliputians to put on. This is all cute but it isnt a movie. For that ""Gullivers Travels"" turns to the tried-and-true storyline of loser-guy-gets-hot-girl. Gullivers courtship of Darcy who eventually shows up in Lilliput parallels a plot involving a Lilliputian commoner (Jason Segel) in love with a Lilliputian princess (Emily Blunt). At one point both of these failures-to-launch must prove themselves by doing battle with a ""Transformers""-style robot that has been built by the Lilliputians enemies the Blefuscians. (In the book theyre called the Blefuscudians. And no there wasnt a robot there either.) The movie by the way is in 3-D. Other than enhancing the bathroom humor it doesnt help.Contains humor of a scatological and mildly risque nature.

Lunch everyone."" Gullivers Travels Bad Director Rob Letterman Cast Jack Black Jason Segel Emily Blunt Amanda Peet. Rating PG for brief rude humor mild language and action. Guide to this weeks new releases Based on bestsellers And thats exactly how ""Gullivers Travels"" plays out. It might have worked too if Black had anything remotely funny to work with. >> Guide to this weeks new releases Instead the man with a thousand rubbery faces is forced to support the film with his manic personality difficult to do with a Lilliputian script. The storys recognition is just one problem. Almost everyone with a high-school education knows the tale of Gulliver arriving in a country where diminutive people dwell (ankle-biters literally). Writers Joe Stillman and Nicholas Stoller try to hit two targets - children whove never heard of the Jonathan Swift classic and romantically inclined adults looking for something fresh. The result is a mix spread so thin its not even knee-high to a Lilliputian. The story gets off to a sluggish start in New York where Lemuel Gulliver works in the mailroom of the New York Tribune. With a crush on travel editor Darcy Silverman (Amanda Peet) he submits a travel-story application and is asked to go to the Bermuda Triangle because apparently she wants a travel story on a vast expanse of ocean. A storm and a whirlpool later Gulliver washes up on the shore of Lilliput where tiny men are tying him down with tiny ropes. When Gulliver is chained in a cave - Lilliput must have a big problem with giants given its readiness in dealing with huge people - he meets Horatio played by Jason Segel with a British accent he bought off Craigslist. Kids already bored now have to sit through a contrived romance between Horatio and Princess Mary (Emily Blunt). A few minutes later a urination sight gag livens things up but pretty soon the movie is back to the romance and children are begging to go to the bathroom. The modern-day Gulliver litters Lilliput with pop-culture references and soon residents are stepping in big piles of everything from ""Star Wars"" to ""Avatar."" The film stumbles along a predictable path and there is an audible wince when Gulliver says ""These little people have grown large in my heart."" A note about 3-D Dont spring for that third dimension. The flat version is fine. It matches the writing. Reach the reporter at scott.cravenarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8773.

Then again the filmmakers have tools at their disposal Swift could never have imagined Swift was unable to depict a Lilliputian soldier getting assaulted by Jack Blacks giant anus in even a single dimension let alone an extremely fuzzy three. With such wonders of technology at their disposal can anyone blame the filmmakers for gutting the material of social commentary? In a performance hes given maybe 15 to 20 times before Jack Black stars as a fun-loving loser who stumbles into a way out of his thankless mailroom job when he plagiarizes a travel-writing sample for pretty boss Amanda Peet and is given an assignment writing about the Bermuda Triangle. Things go predictably awry however and Black washes ashore in the land of Lilliputia a fantastical kingdom populated by tiny little people like loveable lug Jason Segel and princess Emily Blunt. Since Blacks very existence upends everything the Lilliputians know about reality he is in a privileged position to recreate their world however he sees fit to serve as a cross between king god and monster. Rather than comment on how power corrupts however the film has Black re-fashion Lilliputia as the ultimate awesome stoner rec room complete with a micro-Kiss playing a live-action version of Guitar Hero and a theater troupe that performs moments from Blacks ostensibly heroic exploits which bear a suspicious resemblance to Star Wars and Titanic. Like its protagonist Gullivers Travels is big dumb and slow-moving a lumbering oaf of a movie that just barely makes it to feature-length via a groaningly unnecessary production number set to Edwin Starrs ""War."" The 3-D meanwhile will delight only folks who feel that extreme soft-focus should not be reserved for Barbara Walters interviews and Barbra Streisand vehicles. With deadening predictability the filmmakers have reduced a definitive satire about the flaws and foibles of human nature into family-friendly sub-Disney pabulum about an affable slacker who finally musters up the courage to ask a pretty girl at work for a date.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Some films are phoned in. The staggeringly awful ""Gullivers Travels"" was texted. Having run through every second-rate TV show 1980s cartoon character and theme park ride imagination-starved Hollywood is now ransacking classic literature for properties to ruin. The only potential upside of this bombs release would be if Jonathan Swift clawed his way from the grave and wreaked ghastly zombie revenge on those responsible. The story is simple enough for a toddler to follow. The film may even have been made by preschoolers. Once again Jack Black plays an obese air guitar hero in T-shirt cargo shorts and sneakers. This time hes called Lemuel Gulliver and he works as a mail clerk for a magazine. His crush on the travel editor (toothy Amanda Peet visibly concentrating on her paycheck) leads him to fabricate some writing samples and land an assignment about the Bermuda Triangle. A magic whirlpool warps him to a land where the people are pee-wee and the laughs are infinitesimal. A cascade of oafish slapstick ensues. The plot is something about Lilliputs regency monarch (Billy Connolly) and princess (Emily Blunt) needing Gullivers help to resist the advances of a pushy suitor (Chris ODowd) and a warlike rival nation. There is a teeny naval battle several dance routines to tired pop songs a ""Transformers""-style robot smackdown and a few butt-crack jokes. The guiding principle here is that Blacks tired man-child shtick will be fresh and new if he looks 90 feet tall. Theres no hint of inspiration or passion in the execution. Nobody seems to have worked very hard except the merchandising department which scored scads of product placements. Counting them as they pass by is one of the more amusing pastimes this abomination provides. A wandering mind isnt just inevitable in a movie like this its a matter of self-defense. Instead of prohibiting unauthorized cell phone use the ushers for ""Gullivers Travels"" should confiscate the viewers belts and shoelaces.

"Movie review Gullivers Travels - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-ShrekMovie review Gullivers TravelsThe modern world and product placement intrude on Jonathan Swifts tale. Jack Black seemingly ideal for the part shrinks from the big role.December 25 2010|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Jonathan Swift probably never dreamed of the consumer excess that would elbow its way into the great satire of ""Gullivers Travels"" all these centuries later. No doubt hed have been keen on poking fun at this new world a Swift had a fascination with human failings of the most base sort a but I dont think a three-story Coke can thats washed up on the shores of Lilliput with all the other debris in the latest film adaptation is what hed have in mind. Other than product placement opportunities that debris would primarily be Jack Black who stars as a travel writer on assignment in the Bermuda Triangle shipwrecked by a storm then trussed up and tied down by tiny folk like all the Gullivers before him. With director Rob Letterman (""Shark Tale"" and ""Monsters vs. Aliens"") staying Swifts course our intrepid travelers incarceration is followed by trust friendship and finally understanding as everyone tries to answer that age-old question Does size matter? Since this a modern-day telling the modern world intrudes from beginning to end and in 3-D. Before landing on Lilliput Gulliver was at the bottom of a Manhattan publishing giants ladder the mailroom guy with a hopeless crush on Amanda Peets smart successful beauty with a corner office and travel assignments to dole out. Then comes the storm the wreck and suddenly Gulliver finds that he is the giant among men. Back home he tells the little Lilliputians people call him President the Awesome. So hes got some emotional growing up to do. Awesome."");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""649"" height=""160""gt; Well it is and it isnt. Black has the kind of cheeky comic sensibility that should have perfectly suited Gulliver a a straight man if there ever was one with an eye for the absurd. But Blacks brio is off a too much here too little there only occasionally right. In the "" Shrek"" tradition screenwriters Joe Stillman (one of the multitudes with screenplay credit for ""Shrek"" and ""Shrek 2"") and Nicholas Stoller (who rocked a dark comic beat with Russell Brand and ""Get Him to the Greek"") have packed ""Gullivers"" stem to stern with pop culture references. Bermuda Triangle love triangles Transformers Yoda ""Titanic"" KISS (as in the band) and Times Square to name but a few. But this story is not just about Gulliver. It is about the closed society of Lilliput and the machinations that go on behind those high walls. This Lilliput is modeled even more lightly than Swifts was on a not-jolly-old-England with its royalty and rubes rigid rules and warring kingdoms. Emily Blunt who proved such prickly fun in ""The Devil Wears Prada"" is the tastiest small fry in this town. As Princess Mary she is the object of affection for commoner Horatio ( Jason Segel) but is already engaged to a pompous twit of a general played with sublime superiority by Chris ODowd. With most of Lilliput fawning over Gulliver ODowds General Edward is the lone skeptic determined to cut the big guy down to size. Most of the movie follows their skirmishes when its not playing with a Cyrano de Bergerac subplot that has Gulliver feeding bad pickup lines to Horatio. When war comes so do the big 3-D effects. Picture this Cannonballs launched from a big armada of Lilli-foes get embedded in Gullivers bulging bare belly which functions like a giant shot put in reverse sending all those balls flying back. That my friends is the main reason you paid extra for the glasses. Production designer Gavin Bocquet (""Kafka"" and early ""Star Wars"") deserves a shout-out for making the big and the small so compatible and yet so distinct. Though the really amazing feat had to be shrinking all those actors down to pint size for the duration of the shoot unless of course it was the keen eye of director of photography David Tattersall (whose long credit list also includes the first three ""Star Wars"" films) playing some very cool visual tricks on us. ""Gullivers Travels"" is one of those movies that falls between complete disaster and loads of fun. Mild amusement is probably about right. By the way when you get to the scene with the palace fire and Gullivers full bladder dont blame Black and crew for the bawdy result. Swift was the wizard behind that one."");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""649"" height=""110""gt; Box office Gullivers Travels MPAA rating PG for brief rude humor mild language and action Running time 1 hour 25 minutes Playing In general release betsy.sharkeylatimes.com"");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""649"" height=""110""gt; MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESNew on DVD The Kings SpeechApril 17 2011On the Set Jack Black in Gullivers TravelsOctober 31 2010Danson With Lilliputians  NBC VERSION OF JONATHAN SWIFTS...February 4 1996"");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""300"" height=""250""gt;MORE STORIES ABOUTShrekJonathan SwiftCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-gullivers-travels-20101225,0,1364932.story",200,gulliver'stravels7,gulliver'stravels,latimes

Elizabeth Weitzman Friday December 24 2010 400 AM Title Gullivers Travels 3-D family comedy about a giant in a tiny land. With Jack Black Emily Blunt. Director Rob Letterman (125). PG language violence. At area theaters.Jack Blacks persona has always been larger than life so in a way hes the perfect choice for an adaptation of ""Gullivers Travels.""But while Black ably carries the movie on his super-size shoulders Rob Lettermans slacker take on the Jonathan Swift classic is easier to like than respect.Letterman seems perfectly happy to stand back and let the lead do his thing which makes the movie feel like -- well most of Blacks other films. This time he plays Lemuel Gulliver a sad sack working in the mail room at the New York Tribune. Hes got a huge crush on travel editor Darcy Silverman (Amanda Peet) so an awkward stammering conversation somehow gets him sent on assignment to Bermuda.Soon hes sucked into the famed Triangle which hides a tiny country called Lilliput. The miniature citizens are awed by Gullivers size especially once he claims to be the President back home. He even impresses the king (Billy Connolly) and his daughter (Emily Blunt) while making his first real friend in commoner Horatio (Jason Segel). The only skeptic is displaced General Edward (Chris ODowd) who hates the attention this giant interloper is earning.Screenwriters Joe Stillman and Nicholas Stoller have done good work before (""Shrek"" ""Get Him to the Greek""). But they like Letterman dispense with the intelligence and edge of their satirical source content instead to rely on the slouchy charisma of their star.Black doesnt disappoint. He gives the exact same performance weve seen and been charmed by a zillion times before. Kids will be especially pleased by the 3-D vision of Black dressed like a giant baby doll repelling an army with his bare belly and being vanquished by the worlds worst wedgie (yep its that kind of movie).The cast gamely tries to keep up with the scene-stealing ODowd making the strongest impression. Still it all feels so lazy and familiar that adults may find themselves hoping Black will start to challenge himself again -- and the more swiftly the better.eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Paramount Pictures By Joe Morgenstern Updated Dec. 24 2010 1201 a.m. ET The patch is on the other eye and the boot is on the other foot in the Coen brothers remake of ""True Grit"" with Jeff Bridges as Rooster Cogburn. Its the role that won John Wayne his only Oscar four decades ago and Mr. Bridges fills it with boozy panache. Joel Coen and Ethan Coen fill the film with self-conscious good humor--hey its the Coen brothers--and the charmingly old-fashioned locutions of the Charles Portis novel. Remaking a cherished movie is not to borrow a fancy phrase from the dialogue malum in se--wrong in itself--but there are always losses along with the changes and gains. The main loss here is inevitably innocence. Mattie Ross the 14-year-old heroine originally played by Kim Darby is no longer sweet-faced and freshly scrubbed. Shes gimlet-eyed grimly purposeful and precocious in a distinctly modern youre-not-the-boss-of-me way and she delivers her lines like a train conductor with too many stations to announce. Watch a clip from ""True Grit"" starring Jeff Bridges Matt Damon Josh Brolin Barry Pepper and Hailee Steinfeld. Video courtesy of Paramount Pictures. Mattie and her quest to avenge her fathers murder have gained new prominence from the filmmakers decision to use the structure of the book which Mattie narrated rather than to emulate the earlier film which was dominated by John Waynes stirring larger-than-life presence. Yet the heavier load of intricate language is too much for young Hailee Steinfeld. You can see and hear her struggle during a deliciously funny stretch of hard bargaining in which Mattie outwits a pompous horse trader named Stonehill. Ms. Steinfeld who is Matties age does her dogged best but the scene works as well as it does largely because the character actor Dakin Matthews who plays Stonehill brings a lifetime of skill and experience to the encounter. (Strother Martin played the role just as skillfully in the original version.) When it comes to life experience the movies star is no slouch either and he couches it in zestfully comic terms. ""Ive grown old"" this Rooster declares in a growl more gravelly than Popeyes. So he has but Mr. Bridges hasnt; hes grown for the occasion a beer belly a bibulous sneer a lecherous leer and a broader-than-life comic style thats lovely to watch whether Rooster is taking errant potshots at bottles under the influence of too much whisky or confronting four adversaries who mean to blast him off his saddle (in a showdown thats set up lazily and staged perfunctorily). Matt Damon is the Texas Ranger LaBoeuf who lets Mattie know that hes a Ranger with an amusingly vain flip of his lapel to reveal his badge. On the whole though LaBoeuf adds up to less than the sum of his sometimes fumbling and sometimes heroic parts. Josh Brolin who starred in the Coen brothers ""No Country for Old Men"" plays a minor role here as Tom Chaney the man who killed Matties father. Roger Deakins did the cinematography with mixed results. Many of the classic Western exteriors looked washed out and indifferent when I saw the film on a big screen and just as much so later on a DVD screener. But his masterful interiors with their darkly sumptuous tones give the movie a resonance that goes beyond its galloping action and cantering comedy. ENLARGE A scene from The Illusionist. Sony Pictures Classics The Illusionist Sylvain Chomets animated feature began as an act of devotion and became a thing--a fable a tone poem an elegy--of ethereal beauty. Its a movie about melancholy though much more than that and it asks for more than the usual suspension of disbelief. Savoring its singular bittersweetness--and accepting its imperfections--requires suspending customary expectations of story and narrative pace. And of dialogue since many scenes suggest a silent film. Whats left to savor then? Exquisite images poignant humor echoes of cinema history and a sense of having watched genuine magic. As the title indicates the hero is a magician an aging Frenchman called Tatischeff who is struggling to survive on the shrinking music-hall circuit of the late 1950s. (This film has no connection with the Edward Norton film of the same name.) Tatischeff was the real name of the late Jacques Tati the French actor who created the bumbling Mr. Hulot and therein lies the devotional link. Mr. Chomets astonishing debut feature ""The Triplets of Belleville"" had included by way of homage a clip from Tatis 1949 ""Jour de Fete."" Thanks to Tatis daughter Sophie the animator was able to make ""The Illusionist"" from a script that Tati had written but decided not to film in the belief that it was too personal probably because of its implicit father-and-daughter relationship. Watch a clip from the animated film ""The Illusionist."" Video courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics. In everything but name the magician of the film is Mr. Hulot. He moves like Hulot walking in sequential teeters and bows like Hulot with courtesy tinctured by servility. Like Hulot hes an outsider but Tatischeff is also painfully a loner moving from Paris to London and then points north in search of a livelihood. He finds one for a while in Scotland where he meets Alice a young chambermaid who is innocent enough to believe that his magic tricks are the real thing. Their relationship is chaste and all but wordless the filmmaker embraces Tatis minimalist approach to dialogue and music even though their absence gives the troubling impression of dramatic emptiness. (The impression subsides when you give yourself over to the gorgeous images.) Far from prestidigitating his way out of penury the illusionist secretly takes odd demeaning jobs to provide Alice with shelter and pretty clothes. And the love between them remains unstated. Mr. Chomet expresses his story almost exclusively in hand-drawn paintings that move wonderfully nostalgic watercolors of a vanished era. When ""The Illusionist"" is funny the jokes are fragile (scattered feathers mistaken for snow Tatischeffs feral rabbit the magicians fear of rabbit stew). When its lyrical the images shimmer with inner life (Edinburgh as an enchanted city). At one point Tatischeffs deepening sadness prompts him to insist that ""magicians do not exist."" But they do. This movie proves it. Somewhere Sofia Coppolas first feature film in four years is very much about a father and daughter and here again not much at all about overt action. (Like its driver the black Ferrari in the title sequence is going around in circles.) Theres so little action for so long that ""Somewhere"" could qualify as a clinical test for attention deficit disorder; if you stay with it you dont have it. I stayed with it despite the glacial pace maybe because Bill Murrays torpor in Ms. Coppolas ""Lost in Translation"" paid off brilliantly and this hero a disconsolate movie star played by Stephen Dorff is nothing if not torpid at the outset. Whats more Im glad I did. ""Somewhere"" eventually finds humanity--a man you really care about--in the midst of its precious milieu. Mr. Dorffs Johnny Marco recently separated from his wife is holed up and contemplating his life or at least his navel and broken wrist at the famously seedy Chateau Marmont Hotel on the Sunset Strip. Nothing much happens unless youre inordinately interested in pole dancers--Johnny is not--until his daughter Cleo shows up for a visit; shes played with infectious energy and effortless grace by Elle Fanning. Its easy to speculate that the loving Cleo and the frequently absent Johnny are stand-ins for Ms. Coppola and her own famous father but ""Somewhere"" neednt be seen as a film a clef. The movie stands on its own terms as a slow-burning drama of life in a Hollywood purgatory where you can not only check out but leave. Watch a clip from ""Gullivers Travels"" starring Jack Black Jason Segel and Emily Blunt. Video courtesy of 20th Century Fox. Gullivers Travels In my travels Ive seen Roman ruins Greek ruins and Byzantine ruins but Ive never seen a ruin like this live-action version of ""Gullivers Travels."" Jack Black as a wannabe travel writer named Lemuel Gulliver hustles himself a boat trip to the Bermuda Triangle and finds himself in Lilliput. The 3-D is cheesy (2.2-D at best) the gags are gross (Gulliver urinates on an 18th-century palace to extinguish a fire) and the production abandons all hope of coherence when the hero fights a climactic battle with a giant robot out of ""Transformers."" What were they thinking? What were they smoking? What were they singing on the way to the bank? Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com DVD FOCUS ENLARGE The Big Lebowski (1998) Strictly speaking Joel and Ethan Coens now-classic comedy is an absurdist neonoir film about mistaken identity. But theres no reason to be strict about this big sweet teddy bear of an entertainment and no mistaking the identity of the actor who makes the whole thing so consistently likable Jeff Bridges in what might reasonably be assumed is the title role. He plays Jeff Lebowski or The Dude an amiable California stoner mistaken for Jeffrey Lebowski the Big Lebowski of the title an aging Pasadena millionaire (David Huddleston) in whose life and tortured loves The Dude is soon enmeshed. Mr. Hulots Holiday (1953) Innocent fun in a nearly silent classic that pays homage to the era of silent comedy. Jacques Tatis Mr. Hulot an eccentric stranger in his own land arrives at a seaside resort in his ancient sputtering car and carries a butterfly net at the ready. If you wanted to stretch a point you could call it social satire but this first of Tatis Hulot series--which includes ""Mon Oncle"" and ""Trafic""--is much more consistently and enduringly a succession of gently humorous sketches having to do with oddity and human frailty. The School of Rock (2003) Jack Black found his mojo in a movie that gives the lie to Norma Desmonds deathless remark about the pictures having gotten small. This joyous farce is a big deal and its star is nothing less than majestic as a scruffy irreverent rocker passing himself off as a pedagogue in a private school. Mike Whites dazzling script and Richard Linklaters ebullient direction are fully equal to the challenge of morphing Mr. Blacks Dewey Finn from a dissolute mooch into a madcap Mr. Chips who turns a bunch of rigid preteens into a rock band for the ages.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Dec. 24 2010 1200AM EST Last updated Thursday Dec. 23 2010 1150PM EST Comments AA Country USA Language English For a novel written nearly 300 years ago by a dour Irish cleric with a mad-on about the material world and a satiric mindset dark enough to flirt with misanthropy its amazing how well Gullivers Travels travels. Even Jack Black cant ruin the thing although not for lack of trying. And even with all those sharp satiric teeth completely pulled reducing it to gummy sentimentality the tale still has the power to enchant. This is a movie that despite its best efforts to fail doesnt - somehow traces of the original magic endure. Speaking of those best efforts how misguided is the adaptation? Well Jonathan Swift probably didnt know he was writing a rom-com. Here a rotund Gulliver begins as an aging mailroom boy in the bowels of The New York Times where as embodied by Black he regularly ascends to play air guitar annoy people with his pop-eyed goofiness and demonstrate a crush on Darcy the pretty travel editor (Amanda Peet). So starts the rom. Com to follow. In the interim a colleague hits the chubby one with this heaping teaspoon of scorn ""Youre all talk. Youll never be any bigger than this."" Oh but dont we know better. Kiddies you have just had your first lesson in dramatic foreshadowing. Anyway for reasons known best to her the editor packs Gulliver off on assignment to the Bermuda Triangle whereupon he tumbles through the inevitable portal and into the most famous part of the book Part I in the land of Lilliput. There the telescope spins and that lovely shift in perspective - where small is big and big is small where the once lowly are now mighty and majestic kings mere flies to swat - proves its staying power. Although director Rob Letterman takes meagre advantage of the visual opportunities and although his 3-D camera just looks like a retro-fitted irrelevance no matter. Our perspectives disorienting spin is as engrossing as ever - especially I suspect to innocent young eyes. Fun too are the Lilliputians who as luck would have it speak in British accents which allows Chris ODowd to steal every scene hes in. ODowd plays a pompous little general Edward Edwardian but since the satire is removed were pretty much free to love the tiny twit no more so than when dawdling in a drawing room he suddenly remembers his duty with this delicious call to arms ""Must go. Those villages shant pillage themselves."" Meanwhile elsewhere in Lilliput romance blooms on a second front when Horatio the nervous commoner falls for Mary the bored princess an amorous addition that affords two more actors - Jason Segel and Emily Blunt - the chance to totally outshine the nominal star. The conclusion is obvious If only Gulliver would get out of his Travels we might have had a fine movie. Actually I exaggerate slightly. There is one moment when Blacks physical comedy meshes perfectly with Swifts metaphysical bleakness. The author diligent readers might recall had a fixation with bodily functions. So when enemies invade and set fire to the Lilliputian palace who better than our omnipotent Goliath to extinguish the blaze; and what better way than to unzip aim purposefully and quench the flames with a yellow torrent. Its gross but funny and (so to speak) pointed too. Only then do the two Blacks Jacks mannerisms and Jonathans mind find common ground. But the chubby one is soon back to being a giant annoyance. That isnt to say that Swift resurrected and whisked off to Hollywood (now theres an image) wouldnt have cast him. But not in Part I. Hed save him for the chapter that so few read because the satire cuts too close to the bone Part IV where the excrement really hits the fan. Yep Jack Black would make a magnificent Yahoo.

Photo Murray Close AP Gullivers Travels review Little goes long way 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Gullivers Travels Comic adventure. Starring Jack Black Amanda Peet and Jason Segel. (PG. 85 minutes. Opens Saturday at Bay Area theaters.) Like a rare and delicate flower ""Gullivers Travels"" will bloom for one day - Christmas - and then start to fade. It will play as a fairly satisfying and cheerful little movie when buoyed by a packed holiday crowd and the presence of glowing children and happy adults looking forward to a few days off. But on Dec. 26 it wont be nearly as fresh and by Monday it will have to rise and fall on its own merits. And that wont exactly be pretty. So if youre planning to see it go Saturday. The holiday spirit just might be enough to give ""Gullivers Travels"" the magic it lacks. Its not bad. Its cute. The 3-D is pretty much wasted - for long stretches it hardly seems in 3-D at all - but everything to do with Gullivers being a giant among the tiny Lilliputians is handled consistently (no size ratio changes) and seamlessly. Jack Black radiates good nature without pressing his luck and Amanda Peet is in it and shes pretty radiant and good-natured herself. Take any movie. Then add Amanda Peet - she always makes it a little better. Related Stories Gullivers Travels (Really. It works with just about any movie. Imagine Amanda Peet in ""The Godfather"" or in ""Some Like It Hot"" or in ""Citizen Kane."" They all get a little bit better. Not a lot but a little.) In this loose modern adaptation of the Jonathan Swift classic Lemuel Gulliver works in the mail room of a major New York newspaper and hes secretly in love with the travel editor (Peet). To impress her he bluffs about his supposed travel-writing experience and so she sends him on a three-week assignment to pilot a boat into the Bermuda triangle to see what he finds. Its just ""a little story"" she tells him. What a good deal three weeks all expenses paid for a little story. Who said the newspaper business is hurting? And so he hits a storm and wakes up in Lilliput where everyone is about 3 or 4 inches high and where the architecture clothing and government are stuck in the mid-19th century. Gulliver is known as ""the Beast"" and is kept in chains until a fire rages and hes able to save the day by putting it out. Not with a hose exactly. He has to improvise ... Are we on the same page here? The sound youre hearing is Jonathan Swift trying to claw his way out of the grave just so he can kill himself. But wait. Come to think of it - something like thats in the original book. The nice thing about Jack Black onscreen in addition to his being funny is that he really does seem to care about people. Hes warm. So hes nicely placed as the plainspoken fellow who sees wrongs in Lilliput and wants to right them including the princess plans to marry an egotistical oaf instead of a sweet commoner (Jason Segel). As Gulliver Black listens thinks and offers advice. Hes engaged and engaging. But somewhere by the middle the souffle collapses and the movie becomes sleep-inducing. Gulliver doesnt have much to do in Lilliput and we notice that before he does. As short as the movie is the screenwriters have a difficult time coming up with enough incident to hold audience interest and what they devise for the climax is worse than flat. Its cartoonish in the way of a bad action movie. Still heres a little good news to mix with the not-so-good Playing on the same program with ""Gullivers Travels"" as a curtain raiser is a little cartoon about a squirrel who tries to bury an acorn and ends up changing the face of the earth. The cartoon is brilliant and a cut above even the best of what follows.

Unfortunately the result is entirely Lilliputian in ambition even for a childrens movie. In this iteration Jack Blacks Gulliver is a stunted mail-room jockey at a newspaper. He spends most of his time playing Guitar Hero and quietly pining for an attractive travel editor (Amanda Peet) who is above his station in more ways than one. One sloppy and not at all credible misunderstanding later and Gulliver is suddenly traveling alone on assignment to the Bermuda Triangle where a spurting cyclone sends him to Liliput a magically miniaturized realm populated by tiny people. There he becomes a benevolently bodacious god using the diminutive denizens for his own amusement -- the films best bit comes when he has them re-enact films like Star Wars and Titanic on a stage mocked up to look like a television -- while simultaneously teaching them not to be so uptight dude. Director Rob Letterman (Monsters vs. Aliens) sands the edges off of Jonathan Swifts tale and replaces them with robots wedgie jokes and a neatly wrapped all-you-need-is-confidence personal message which also plays out through Jason Segels attempts as a lower-caste Lilliputian to woo his kingdoms princess (Emily Blunt). By now Black is used to playing characters who are adolescents stuck in an adults body so the sight of him tromping around a tiny kingdom like its a play set is strangely fitting. I just don?t know if the real kids in the audience will be having as much fun.

I just figured out what was wrong with the ""King Kong"" remake a few years ago Jack Black should have played the beast -- one that says ""Now lets go partaaay-ahhh-yeah"" In the 3-D comedy-fantasy ""Gullivers Travels"" Black is shy geeky New York City mailroom attendant Lemuel Gulliver a guy who will never be a big shot. ""Were not on their level"" he says of the editorial staff at his newspaper. ""Were the little people."" Gulliver gets his chance to blow up huge though when he is tapped by the papers travel editor (Amanda Peet) to go report on the Bermuda Triangle which he sails into alone. Despite this being his maiden assignment he has already learned the only thing you need to know about newspapering If an editor tells you to do it you do it. Lumbering around the island of Lilliput where the vaguely English vaguely 17th-century thumb-size citizens do speaketh in a curious manner Gulliver is welcomed sort of by the royal court ""I wanted a bracelet"" complains the queen ""not a great big hairy beast."" But this beast unlike Kong understands marketing. He allows Lilliput to believe that he is a leader in his own land -- ""President the Awesome"" is his formal title -- but that he doesnt mind hanging out here where the Lilliputians quickly build him a home and cheer his defeat of a rival little-people nation. Back home argues Gulliver Vice President Yoda can handle things for a while. Black was already the worlds biggest little kid and he might be the only actor who could have made this movie such nimble fun. No matter how thin the concept Black always manages to make it his own. Here he helps a friendly little dude (Jason Segel) woo his fair princess (Emily Blunt) by feeding him lines from Prince (the wee royal from Minneapolis not Lilliput) and busts out classic-rock lyrics like ""War What is it good for? Absolutely naught"" Whether hes being treated as a little dolly by the giants on Brobdingnag organizing the first-ever Lillipalooza or deploying a platoon of Lilliputian marching soldiers to work out a few knots in his back he doth have a merry way about him. The movies got elements of ""Shrek"" and ""Night at the Museum"" but it has a much more childlike bounce to it than the latter zinging from one silly situation to the next without a care. It simply throws us back to fairy-tale movies of the 50s and 60s in which Danny Kaye could be relied upon to mug enough to earn his pay and the special effects tickled the imagination. The Jonathan Swift novel is except for the idea of little people at war all but completely ignored but Swift would have approved His satire was full of the most up-to-the-minute jokes of 1726. Nor would the coiner of the word ""yahoo"" object to nonsense dialogue. As for the main dirty joke in the movie about an unusual fire engine its straight from the book in which Gulliver speaks of ""Urine which I voided in such a Quantity and applied so well to the proper Places that in three minutes the Fire was wholly extinguished."" Jonathan Swift Jack Black -- theyre just a couple of lovable whiz kids. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Actress Demi Lovato reaches settlement with dancer she all...

"Gullivers Travels review Jack Black stars in misguided remake of a classic |       NJ.com comments Gullivers Travels review Jack Black stars in misguided remake of a classic Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on December 24 2010 at 801 AM View/Post Comments Gulliver becomes a Manhattan slacker played by the clownish Jack Black in the new 3D ""Gullivers Travels."" Some books are too adult for grown-ups -- and so theyre quickly turned into stories for children. After all its safer to think that ""Frankenstein or The Modern Prometheus"" is only about a mad doctor or that ""Alices Adventures in Wonderland"" is about a mad tea party than to deal with their pointed critiques of morals history and society. Better juvenile than Juvenal -- and so Jonathan Swifts ""Gullivers Travels"" was long ago stripped of its comments on religious intolerance and political idiocy to become a nursery tale concerning only a shipwrecked sailor and some tiny cutely bellicose natives. Its that again in this new version which modernizes the story (Lem Gulliver is now not a ships surgeon but a Manhattan slacker) drops (as most versions do) three-fourths of his adventures and then puts the whole thing in 3-D. So why is it that this new take seems to make even my old Classics Illustrated version look like 4-D? Movie Review Gullivers Travels (PG) Fox (85 min.) Directed by Rob Letterman. With Jack Black Emily Blunt Billy Connolly. Now playing in New Jersey. Rating note The film contains bathroom jokes and more of Jack Black than you ever wanted to see. Stephen Whittys Review ONE STARS A big part of that diminishment comes from star Jack Black. He first showed an offbeat appeal in movies like ""High Fidelity"" and briefly seemed like a new sensation in ""School of Rock"" -- willing to go anywhere for a joke whether audiences were urging him on or not. Unfortunately what once seemed like Blacks new character -- a slangy clown with antic eyebrows and a love of cheesy rock -- has been revealed as his only character. And his willingness to do anything with or without encouragement no longer seems like such a virtue. I mean -- really -- do you have a burning desire to see Jack Blacks buttocks? Blown up in the land of Lilliput to 12 times their normal size? I didnt think so. The movie also -- with typical wish-fulfillment casting -- drags in poor Amanda Peet as Blacks ""secret crush"" who of course eventually crushes back (a development far less believable than the discovery of the Polly Pocket world of Lilliput). And Emily Blunt as a petite princess who unfathomably falls for the spud-faced Jason Segel. Even more criminal is the casting -- and wasting -- of genuine comedic talents like Billy Connolly who fumes tiresomely as a tiny king and the wonderful Lucy Punch who always looks like an ""Avenue Q"" puppet come to raucous life yet gets absolutely nothing to do here. Gulliver becomes a Manhattan slacker played by the clownish Jack Black in the new 3D ""Gullivers Travels."" But then theres a great deal wasted in this movie including whatever the studio spent -- was it 2 or 3? -- on the dreadful special effects. And yet through it all strides the grinning Black a colossal colossally unfunny clown. Its a shame because theres true wit in Swifts classic and real wisdom. In its final section -- the one almost every adapter skips -- Gulliver finds himself in a land populated by elegant intelligent horses and foully ignorant humanoid ""Yahoos."" The book ends with him a tired bitter and misanthropic man. And he hadnt even seen this movie.

The groundbreaking literary satire gets treated shabbily in this film which begins in modern-day Manhattan.By Steven Rea Inquirer Movie CriticPosted December 24 2010The iconic image of Gullivers Travels - Jonathan Swifts book the myriad illustrated versions and all the subsequent movies and cartoons - is the one with the giant man splayed on the beach strapped down by hundreds of tiny ropes and tiny soldiers clambering furiously over his body.That scene is restaged early in the latest Gullivers Travels with Jack Black fresh from 21st-century Manhattan but tossed ashore on Lilliput flat on his back his Converse All-Stars aiming skyward. If only the Lilliputians could have figured out how to keep the one-note comic actor in restraints and maybe jab him now and again with pointy sticks.A murderously unfunny rethink of the groundbreaking literary satire Gullivers Travels - directed by Rob Letterman (Shark Tale Monsters vs. Aliens) and presented in superfluous 3-D on many screens - takes the basic big-man-among-wee-people concept AND DOES ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WITH IT. Unless you consider transforming Lilliputs elegant 18th-century grand plaza into a tacky Times Square commercial strip or having Gulliver battle a towering Transformer-like robot doing something.Black alack is Lemuel Gulliver a mail-room employee for a New York newspaper. Hes one of the ""little people"" (get it?) way down the hierarchical chart and his underachieving slacker ways seem destined to keep him there. He cant even summon the nerve to ask the travel editor he has a crush on - Darcy Silverman (Amanda Peet) - on a date. But then in a panicky moment of characteristic callowness he presents a couple of sample articles to impress her. Never mind that he plagiarized them (hes bumbling hes jive and hes ethically challenged). Before Darcy finds out she has sent him on assignment to the Bermuda Triangle which is how he ends up in the land of Lilliput.There a monarchy (Billy Connolly as king Catherine Tate the queen) has problems with the enemy Blefuscians. The royals also have to manage their pouty daughter Princess Mary (Emily Blunt all dressed up with nowhere to go) betrothed halfheartedly to Lilliputs stuffy general (Chris ODowd). But really its a Lilliputian everyman Horatio (Jason Segel) who pines for her and thinks that she would pine right back if she could.Gulliver wholly ineffective when it comes to romance back on his own turf becomes Horatios mentor saying all sorts of Jack Black-y things to him like ""youve got to employ some grade-A court-ahhge."" Gulliver stops short of calling everybody dude but just.Joe Stillman whose credits includes some Shreks and Nicholas Stoller who directed Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Get Him to the Greek and who should know better have their names on the screenplay. And Black as if reliving his School of Rock salad days offers the eensy-weensy populace his cover versions of Princes ""Kiss"" and Edwin Starrs ""War"" (""what is it good for?"").Those lucky Lilliputians. They could have buried him in the sand.Contact movie critic Steven Reaat 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Gullivers Travels which opens tomorrow is a migraine inducement that youd think Jack Black had gotten out of his system years ago. Yet he still finds an excuse to wear a blazer and shorts and fling his bodily orb like Angus Young on Guitar Hero night at the neighborhood bar. When he starts with his ""School of Rock performance we know hes on autopilot. The movie directed by Rob Letterman and credited to two screenwriters is much worse off Theres no one in the cockpit at all.Poor Jonathan Swift provides the nominal source material. Giant man lands on an island kingdom dotted with hors doeuvres-size people. Black becomes the local hero. The Lilliputians build him a glass-and-steel manse that anywhere else would sit above Los Angeles. He hooks the princess (Emily Blunt) up with a strapping peasant (Jason Segel) extinguishes a fire by urinating on it (and King Billy Connolly -- and us) protects the island from its dapper enemies and stages live miniature performances of ""Titanic and ""Star Wars under the fib that the movies are the story of his life.Bits of this like the stage shows are clever but a presiding wit is scarce. Theres simply a halfhearted maturity moral but hasnt Jack Black the stoned slacker already matured into Jack Black the adult? Not satisfactorily enough it seems. In this case before landing in Lilliput hes a mailroom derelict who upon returning winds up a travel writer for a New York newspaper with a fantastically enormous budget and Amanda Peet as the moony section editor.Black is an obvious hit with kids. He makes a lot of funny faces drops his pants once by force gets a wedgie from a giant robot dresses up like a baby and exuberantly plays a lot of Guitar Hero. (The hookah that appears in the frame of the final shot might be lost on the small.) Theres even an embarrassingly energetic musical number in which the cast dances badly and the camera points up into the stars crotch. Did I mention that were required to gaze at all this through 3-D glasses? The difference between the foulness here and that of say ""Jackass 3D is a matter of competence.

"Gullivers Travels | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; gulliver-s-travels ) Gullivers Travels (United States 2010) December 23 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli With the arrival of this ""adaptation"" of Gullivers Travels author Jonathan Swift must be spinning in his grave fast enough to make a top dizzy. If Swift was alive no doubt hed demand that his name be removed from the credits. Little of his satirical classic beyond a few names locations and general ideas have survived the transition from the written page to the dumbed-down family adventure foisted upon the public by director Rob Letterman and screenwriters Joe Stillman and Nicholas Stoller. Still the chief sin committed by Gullivers Travels is not that its a poor adaptation but that its entertainment value is almost nonexistent. Only the movies ""high concept"" remains the same as the one in the book and the narrative ransacks no more than Book One of Swifts Gullivers Travels (with a brief nod to Book Two). So Gullivers Travels is about the voyage of Lemuel Gulliver (Jack Black) to the mysterious Island of the Lilliputians a race of six-inch high ""little people"" where he becomes a figure of great curiosity and becomes embroiled in local politics. There ends any common ground the movie has with the book. In this version Gulliver is a mail clerk at a newspaper office in Manhattan rather than a surgeon in England. To court favor with Darcy Silverman (Amanda Peet) the travel editor he agrees to fly to Bermuda to investigate ""new findings"" about the Bermuda Triangle. Once there he heads out to sea in a one-man craft becomes lost and winds up in the country of Lilliput. After an initial period as a prisoner in which his lone friend is fellow dungeon denizen Horatio (Jason Segel) he finds favor with the royal family - King Theodore (Billy Connolly) Queen Isabelle (Catherine Tate) and Princess Mary (Emily Blunt) - and becomes Lilliputs protector displaying disgruntled General Edward (Chris ODowd). After singlehandedly defeating the would-be invading fleet of the rival country Blefuscu Gullivers status in Lilliput soars but this encourages Edward to commit an act of treason in an attempt to bring down his big rival. To make Gullivers Travels more ""modern"" the filmmakers have injected pop references to Star Wars Titanic and KISS while having Gulliver build a replica of Times Square in Lilliput. The climactic battle pits the local giant against a Transformer - something not even Jules Verne would have conceived. Gullivers visit to Brobdingnag is limited to a five minute sequence in which he finds himself captive in a doll house. None of Swifts themes about government religion and human nature make their way into the cluttered mess of a screenplay and any satirical elements have been blunted beyond recognition to leave room for the fatuous unfunny humor of the leading man. In short for fans of Swift and good cinema Gullivers Travels is a disaster. Once again Jack Black proves himself incapable of playing someone other than Jack Black. Hes like the drunk annoying cousin who shows up at a family reunion and engages in a series of outrageous antics to display how cool and funny he is when in reality hes merely irritating. The problem isnt simply that Black is miscast but he believes hes hilarious and by foisting this faux amusing personality on us he transforms Gullivers Travels into an almost unendurable 85 minutes. The filmmakers succeed in making Chris ODowds Edward more dislikable than Gulliver - an approach that succeeds only in ensuring that viewers have no rooting interest in the final smackdown between man and Transformer. Emily Blunt reportedly turned down the Scarlett Johansson role in Iron Man 2 to make this film which indicates she needs to fire her agent. The only arena in which Gullivers Travels plays an adequate game is in visual effects. The interaction of big Gulliver with the tiny Lilliputians is handled without major gaffes. It looks like Jack Black is approximately twelve times the size of his co-stars. My requisite comment about the box office-inflating 3-D is that its largely inconsequential but non-intrusive. One of my first thoughts on leaving the theater was to wonder why anyone would pay a surcharge for the meager benefits provided here for 3-D viewing. Upon further consideration I amended that Why would anyone pay anything to see this movie regardless of how many dimensions its being shown in?

ABOUT THE MOVIEGullivers Travels  out of four Stars Jack Black Amanda Peet Jason Segel Emily Blunt Billy ConnollyDirector Rob LettermanDistributor 20th Century FoxRating PG-13 for brief rude humor mild language and actionRunning time 1 hour 25 minutesOpens Saturday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Gullivers Travels yet another foray into unnecessary 3-D is a rehashed mishmash of Jonathan Swifts 18th-century classic. Mostly its a vehicle for Jack Blacks zany humor. Gone are any elements of political satire. The Lilliputians exist only as devices and their ordered world is merely a prism to be seen through 3-D lenses. This could easily if clunkily have been called ""Giant Guy Conquers Fears and Takes World of Tiny People by Storm."" Black plays Lemuel Gulliver a slacker mail room clerk at a newspaper with a big crush on travel editor Darcy (Amanda Peet). He cant muster up the nerve to ask her on a date but instead wangles an assignment writing a travel piece about the Bermuda Triangle. Off he goes on a boat he doesnt know how to sail. A storm tosses his vessel and he gets shipwrecked on Lilliput an island filled with very tiny people. Blacks towering stature is intended to provide all sorts of physical comedy including an inane scene of his posterior looming gargantuan -- in comparison to Lilliputians. Kids might enjoy some of Blacks wacky antics but adults will tire of them fast. The Lilliputians vaguely 18th-century-ish wholeheartedly embrace Gullivers modernisms as the big guy spins yarns from recent history and contemporary life placing himself in key moments like a latter-day Zelig. He lies that hes president of the country he hails from and takes credit for the most noteworthy inventions spinning tales about conquering Darth Vader and surviving the sinking of the Titanic. Some of this generates a laugh or two but most falls flat. He eases his way into the townspeoples good graces and helps to facilitate a romance between Horatio (Jason Segel) and Princess Mary (Emily Blunt) daughter of King Theodore (Billy Connolly). Pompous Gen. Edward (Chris ODowd) has already asked the princess to marry him but Gulliver offers Horatio the wooing tricks that the guy cant muster with Darcy. While Segel and Black have an easygoing chemistry Blunt seems a bit lost here. Black owns the show Segel has a bit part and the others might as well be extras which is a shame since Connolly and Blunt certainly can hold their own in comedies. To satisfy short attention spans Gulliver leads his tiny new pals in battle against their archenemies. A transformer-like robot controlled by the buffoonish villain Gen. Edward figures into what is meant to be climactic but mostly just drags. Black was the executive producer and there are a few moments that recall his engaging persona in School of Rock and High Fidelity but not enough to make this a worthwhile enterprise. Given his ultra-contemporary persona he probably should stick to more offbeat original works -- he was hilarious in the weird Nacho Libre-- rather than watering down the classics.

Working in the mail room of a newspaper Black manages to pass himself off as a travel writer and after a shipwreck leaves him washed ashore in the strange land he cons the tiny Lilliputians into believing hes a sage responsible leader. He doesnt have much going for him besides pop-culture references and his own looming girth but he repels attackers by swallowing them into his butt crack and puts out a fire in the royal palace by pissing on the king (Billy Connolly).

Blacks playing a ""Gulliver"" but while sharing disproportionate size with Jonathan Swifts protagonist he has more in common with Mark Twains Connecticut Yankee an Ugly American who eventually wins the awe of the ancient rigidly class-conscious culture he crashes by pissing all over it -- in one instance quite literally. Having gained the awe of Lilliputs little people Gulliver infects the island with imported trash culture embellishing his legend by stitching together a life story from Hollywood blockbusters and turning the Lilliputian capital into Times Square -- or Piccadilly for this Anglo-American co-production often reads as a farce of disillusion and rapprochement in trans-Atlantic relations. The opening-act Ice Age short shames Gullivers murky effects and afterthought 3-D but Black looking like an unwashed clothes pile and capering in familiar ""Uncle Jack"" style is a good babysitter his cross-dressing turn in a dolls house a highlight.

"Better Gulliver had stayed home | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesBetter Gulliver had stayed homeJack Black is gigantically unfunny in Gullivers Travels.Jack Blacks comedic output is in inverse proportion to his size in Gullivers Travels.  (HYDRAULX PHOTO)  By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterFri. Dec. 24 2010Gullivers Travels(out of 4)Starring Jack Black Jason Segal Emily Blunt Amanda Peet and Chris ODowd. Directed by Rob Letterman. 85 minutes. At major theatres. PGThe verdict on Jack Blacks mock-rock take on Gullivers Travels? Not too Swift.But thats hardly the point when the Hollywood comedy sausage factory cranks out a kids movie loosely based on a classic tale like Jonathan Swifts 18th-century satire. The only two Swiftian plot points usually funny writers Joe Stillman (Shrek Shrek 2) and Nicholas Stoller (Get Him To The Greek) -- who are really slumming here -- are devoted to are size issues and the instance where the gigantic Gulliver (Black) whips out his man hose and puts out a palace fire by peeing all over the joint.Article Continued BelowUnderachieving schlub Gulliver toils in the mailroom at a New York newspaper and aims for bigger things like winning the heart of the travel editor Darcy (Amanda Peet) in between rounds of Guitar Hero by plagiarizing some stories from the web. Shell see him in a new light liars being chick magnets.Impressed Darcy sends Gulliver on a three-week assignment to uncover some truths about the Bermuda Triangle. His solo voyage piloting a cabin cruiser south is interrupted Gilligan style and Gulliver wakes up washed up on a beach staked down by wee folks called the Lilliputians. Gulliver is huge. His captors are little. Black spends the next hour reprising most of School of Rock and Nacho Libre. The first butt joke clocks in at the 20-minute mark. The end.You want to know more?Usually hilarious Billy Connolly rules the Lilliput kingdom with a complete lack of humour and should fire his agent. Emily Blunt plays his strong-willed daughter who starts out garbed like a princess but occasionally ends up wearing suburban mall-rat wear which looks weird in the midst of the high-concept Steampunk look the designers have crafted to distract from the sorry script.Shunned as a beast and thrown in the dungeon for being too tall -- overacting not being a crime in Lilliput -- Gulliver hooks up with fellow prisoner and misunderstood Lilliputian Horatio (Jason Segal using a ridiculously bad British accent) whos in the slammer for making goo-goo eyes at the princess to the annoyance of her pencil-necked geek of a boyfriend Gen. Edward (Chris ODowd).Like Connolly Segal deserves better that playing second banana to the hammy chubster Black who bounces around like a deranged kangaroo in board shorts when hes not arching one eyebrow in his trademark ""sardonic Jack"" look. A quick side trip to the land of the giants adds an opportunity for Black to clown around in a pinafore and hair ribbons which will make kids lose their minds because nothing is funnier when you are 5 than a boy in a dressThe 3-D does little beyond giving the impression were watching the movie through a View-Master while lightening your wallet by a few extra bucks for a ticket. A Transformers-inspired robot-vs.-Gulliver fight scene is just plain dumb. Kids will enjoy the rock em sock em but parents should not be dismayed if the only lesson they take away from Gullivers Travels is how to give a wedgie.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Swifts story liberally adapted fun but no big deal - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Swifts story liberally adapted fun but no big dealGullivers Travels a 2 1/2 starsDecember 23 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticJack Black plays a travel writer who discovers an island full of belligerent wee folk in the latest big-screen adaptation of the Jonathan Swift fantasy ""Gullivers Travels."" Might this be one of those films appealing to both wee folk and older folk alike? Dec. 22Agreeably slapdash which is exactly what I thought of the widely derided (and ruder) Harold Ramis caveman comedy ""Year Zero"" the Jack Black-tailored cut of ""Gullivers Travels"" bashes its way through a series of adventures in scale ego and moderate amusement existing primarily for set pieces such as Blacks character Lemuel Gulliver leading the Lilliputians and their enemies the Blefuscians in a chorus of ""War (What Is It Good For?)"". The cast is enjoyable with Jason Segel (as Gullivers lil pal Horatio) and Emily Blunt (the local princess) a witty cut above for this sort of thing."");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""300"" height=""160""gt; Not much of the early 18th century Jonathan Swift original survives this round shot in 3-D (oh that old thing). A mailroom clerk thwarted by his own lack of ambition Gulliver works in the guts of a great New York newspaper where the travel editor (Amanda Peet) vexes him with her easygoing fabulousness. Improbably and thanks to a dangerous round of travel-journalism plagarism he convinces her to send him on assignment to the Bermuda Triangle. There he runs into unusual weather patterns survives a shipwreck and washes up on the shores of Lilliput where he soon acquits himself as a savior-beast and enjoys the fruits of his newfound celebrity. This new version of ""Gulliver"" takes a cue from Swift with its brief detour to the nearby island of Brobdingnag where Gulliver is suddenly tiny and the people (we see only one a petulant little girl who makes him play dollies and tea party) are immense. Mainly though we have Black stomping around being the big cheese among the mouse-sized courtiers. Gulliver coaches Horatio on wooing the princess by various exotic means including a rendition of the Prince song ""Kiss."" Some of this is pretty funny as when Gulliver has the Lilliputians re-enact scenes from his life (actually scenes from ""Titanic"" and the ""Star Wars"" saga) at a newly built and neatly tricked-out performance hall. Some of it isnt as when Black squares off against a large robot version of his nemesis (Chris ODowd). Fully half of ""Gullivers Travels"" doesnt quite come off yet the whole of it is earnestly silly and rather sweet. These are not the virtues of a blockbusting commercial comedy. My son 10 didnt love it but he liked it and that friends pretty much says it for me too. mjphillipstribune.com MPAA rating PG (for brief rude humor mild language and action) Cast Jack Black (Lemuel Gulliver); Jason Segel (Horatio); Emily Blunt (Princess Mary); Amanda Peet (Darcy); Chris ODowd (Gen.

A classic ready-made for the era of big-budget 3D spectacle gets the least classy treatment imaginable in ""Gullivers Travels"" a loose lowest-common-denominator retelling of Jonathan Swifts mock travelogue that drops a giant loser in the land of the little people. Rather than exploiting the scenarios obvious cinematic possibilities director Rob Letterman permits Jack Blacks already larger-than-life persona to dwarf everything else in sight letting this sad-sack Gulliver fulfill whatever fantasies he was denied in the real world -- an angle more appealing to disenfranchised 7-year-olds than for those buying the tickets. Fox has big hopes but should expect only medium-sized returns. Where the source novel used wit -- and a fair amount of off-color humor -- to comment on the attitudes and behaviors of its time this offputting update offers no such insights. Instead it lifts a few choice details from the first book of Swifts four-part satire (including an incident in which Gulliver extinguishes a fire by emptying his bladder on the blaze) and rounding out the rest with sheer silliness. Blacks lovable-slob shtick carried ""School of Rock"" and subsequent kiddie fare but his Gulliver comes across as considerably less appealing. A self-absorbed manchild whose lack of hygiene is matched only by his lack of ambition Gulliver toils in the mailroom of a Gotham newspaper where he harbors a not-so-secret crush on travel editor Darcy Silverman (Amanda Peet). Too nervous to ask her out he instead accepts an assignment traveling to the Bermuda Triangle where strange weather conditions (a vortex that reps the first of the films mediocre visual effects) transport him to the land of Lilliput. Gulliver awakens tied to the ground by men no taller than toy soldiers in a grotesque parody of the books most iconic scene one that presents the pot-bellied Black looking like a beached whale amid the tiny Lilliputians. Rather than modernizing the race of mini-men to poke fun at our own small-mindedness screenwriters Joe Stillman and Nicholas Stoller present them as broad parodies of the 18th-century court with the countrys hapless King Theodore (Billy Connolly) and sniveling Gen. Edward (Chris ODowd) engaged in ongoing war with their equally ridiculous rivals the Blefuscians. Though distrusted at first Gulliver proves invaluable in defending the kingdom putting that blubber to good use deflecting microscopic cannonballs. As a reward Gulliver is granted full use of the Lilliputian workforce which he employs in the most self-serving manner possible within the bounds of a PG rating re-creating the glories of his Gotham lifestyle to suit his newly inflated ego which involves the little folks constructing everything from a Sphinx-scale La-Z-Boy chair to a miniature version of Times Square featuring Gulliver-themed billboards. If this spin on Swifts tale sounds disappointingly cartoonish that conceivably owes to the combined sensibilities of Black and director Letterman a veteran of such DreamWorks Animation pics as ""Shark Tale"" and ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" (the latter involving a similar challenge juggling characters of wildly different scales). Like a number of animation helmers before him Letterman struggles in the live-action medium. He seems overwhelmed by the visual effects challenges clumsily moving from scene to scene and unable to marshal unity among the performances. Black runs wild opposite ODowds more mannered comic turn while co-stars Emily Blunt and Jason Segel grapple awkwardly with a distracting romantic subplot. The story grows more desperate as it goes on squeezing in a visit to the super-sized land of Brobdingnag and an inexplicable robot battle en route to a goofy cover of Edwin Starrs anti-Vietnam anthem ""War."" With its wacky accents and silly shenanigans ""Gullivers Travels"" could have been ""Time Bandits"" for a new generation but instead feels like ""Attack of the 50-Foot Couch Potato."" Although a tilt-shift opening credits sequence cleverly makes Manhattan look like a scale model the rest of David Tattersalls lensing is bland relying heavily on a ""DualMoCo"" camera system which enabled such innovations as the sight of a three-inch man disappearing inside Blacks butt crack. Rather than enhancing the dramatic size differences the addition of 3D merely draws attention to pics heavy use of greenscreen. Fox bolsters the features anemic running time with a three-minute short ""Scrats Continental Crack-Up"" which amusingly reveals how the ""Ice Age"" squirrels insatiable acorn lust split apart Pangaea.

TWITTER Increasingly studios are slapping 3D on movies not to add entertainment value but to conceal a lack of dimension in a movies story or characters. While not the worst in recent 3D films ""Gullivers Travels"" is more gimmicky than a crackling good yarn. The film feels rushed and slight at every point. Thanks to inspired clowning by Jack Black and a solid cast that breathes life into an inert story the movie works as a moderately entertaining childrens movie. Opening domestically on Christmas Day Gullivers Travels should enjoy a brief burst of box-office activity. The great irony about Jonathan Swifts 1726 novel Gullivers Travels is that librarians and schoolteachers have forever relegated to the shelves of childrens books what is in fact a scathing moral satire of the corrupt English society of his time and mankinds proclivity for irrationality and vice over common sense and virtue. (Mark Twains equally savage satire The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn suffers a similar fate.) There is something about the comical idea of a normal-sized human striding through a kingdom of tiny people -- an image derived entirely from Gullivers first voyage to Lilliput -- that consigns his literary masterpiece to the world of elves trolls and fairy princesses. The latest version which comes from several filmmakers with backgrounds in animation casts Black as a shy ambition-challenged mailroom clerk for a New York newspaper. This opening setting is a nostalgic one mind you as its busy newsroom is crowded with employed journalists and a travel editor occupies an office fit for a managing editor. Blacks Gulliver has a long-standing crush on that travel editor (Amanda Peet) but can never bring himself to ask her out. Goaded by a colleague into approaching her he winds up not with a date but with a travel assignment. That takes him to the Bermuda Triangle where a storm washes him into an inter-dimensional portal that carries him to Lilliput where remnants of Swifts tale take over. The kingdom is made to look somewhat like 18th century England and features mostly British actors. The tiny Lilliputians struggle to imprison this ""giant"" but when he escapes he performs heroic deeds that save the people. Among these displays of bravery one actually borrowed from the original story is the day when he puts out a fire in the royal palace by urinating on the flames. Emboldened by his newly acquired size Gulliver now exaggerates his past drawing on film culture to cast himself as the victorious hero of stories ranging from Star Wars to Titanic. This kernel of an idea -- a small man suddenly talking big -- never develops beyond a few gags involving contemporary movies however. In the tiresome manner of most studio-generated comedies its protagonist must undergo a trajectory that confronts him with his character flaws and improves his defective personality. Gulliver also inserts himself into a romantic triangle featuring the islands princess (Emily Blunt) her military suitor (Chris ODowd) and the commoner (Jason Segel) who really loves her. Here again a conspicuous lack of imagination finds director Rob Letterman (Shark Tale Monsters vs. Aliens) and writers Joe Stillman (Shrek Shrek 2) and Nicholas Stoller (Forgetting Sarah Marshall) pillaging ideas from Cyrano de Bergerac to Transformers Iron Man and even Blacks School of Rock. When Peets character somehow turns up in Lilliput -- thats one busy inter-dimensional portal -- the movie truly loses its mooring. There is even a sequence borrowing loosely from Gullivers second voyage to Brobdingnag where Black a tiny friend and a giant child all occupy the same frame in a CGI shootout. Any sense of fun slowly drains away as the movie insists on highlighting effects over character and story. Black does his best to keep you entertained and the rest of the cast which includes a dignified Billy Connolly and an aloof Catherine Tate as Lilliputs king and queen keep tongues firmly planted in cheeks as they maneuver around the CG effects. Blunt amusingly spoofs some of her serious films such as The Young Victoria while ODowd and Segel achieve a farcical rivalry. The production is smooth given how its pieced together from so many elements.

Conscious of but happy with his social standing among the newspapers high-flying bigwigs Gulliver is nevertheless persuaded by a fellow colleague to improve his lot. So using entire chapters plagiarised from Time Out and Fodors travel websites he persuades Amanda Peet s editor Darcy - for whom of course he has the hots - to commission him to do a write-up. She then sends him off to the mysterious and dangerously stormy Bermuda Triangle...And so we set sail towards the main bulk of the storyline as Gulliver washes up on the shores of an island occupied by a race of six-inch-high little people. At this juncture the film dances into Monty Python territory with pompous Regency characters flapping about spouting frivolous dialogue - none more so than Chris ODowds hawkish Graham Chapman-like general.The film has a high old time playing with its clash of cultures but as a piece of storytelling its all over the place. Scenes crash into one another as if the whole structure was developed on the fly; we even get a bit of Transformers thrown in for bad measure - and not one but two romantic subplots. Black rolls out his amusing School of Rock shtick a couple of times and theres one especially comical homage to Cyrano de Bergerac. But mostly it veers between the very mildly chucklesome and plain not funny. Youngsters will doubtless enjoy the sight of a galoot galumphing around a model village but the script is so dispiritingly slipshod that even theyll be egging it on towards its foreseeable conclusion.

Considering the quality of the cast the acting was quite poor the story line disjointed and very few laughs. I usually like Jack Black but this was not one of my favourite films should have stayed at home and watched TV.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 10 2011Stephen JonesFeaturedGullivers travels in hindsight I wish that I and my seven year old had not bothered to travel to the cinema or part with the better part of fifteen quid to watch this film. The story or what there was of it stumbled from one ridiculous premise to the next the appearance of a stray from one of the transformer movies being one of the narratives particular low points. If the cast crew and production team were to hold their hands up and say sorry we did it for a bet or for the money then Ill forgive them just this once dont do it again.

It was ok we chuckled a a few bits but mostly it was pretty ordinary. Thing that disappointed us was that it was billed as a 3D film (and we paid extra for this feature) but there were very few if any real 3 D effects.
