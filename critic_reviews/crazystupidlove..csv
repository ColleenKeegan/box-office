Theres a moment midway through Crazy Stupid Love - a seduction scene between brash but likeable ladies man Ryan Gosling (in his second film this week after Drive) and nervy alcohol-fuelled Emma Stone - which is one of the most witty truthful beautifully acted scenes in any film so far this year. Its an out-of-nowhere heart-grabber in which script performance and tone find a truly perfect balance.Unfortunately the rest of the movie is a mess. This is one of those literate star-stuffed family comedies of which Hollywood is fond at the moment - think a more phallocentric The Kids Are Alright. Steve Carell (pictured left) splits from wife Julianne Moore when she has an affair with Kevin Bacon leading Carell to pal up with Gosling for a Hitch-style character reinvention. Directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa rose to prominence with the script for scabrous Christmas classic Bad Santa but theyve fallen hard here this is witless saccharine and lifeless - all except for that one glorious scene.

Apart from the scene detailed in the review it is such a huge disappointment. It hurtles from cliche to cliche with the biggest and most obvious cliche being signposted way ahead. I dont want to spoil it but when it hits about fifteen minutes from the end you will know. A film designed by focus groups with a fake and faux happy ending that falls into the cliche re PG13 when it wants to and should be R18 as Emma Stones character says in the seduction scene. It could and maybe should have been the best and smartest family sex and relationship film since Sex Lies and Videotape it should perhaps be titled dull boring and cliched. Very disappointed.

"Crazy Stupid Love. | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; crazy-stupid-love ) Crazy Stupid Love. (United States 2011) July 29 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli Crazy Stupid Love. tries to rise above the unremarkable level of the generic romantic comedy. In almost every way from structure to tone to the nature of the love stories it strives to be more. And while all its gambits are not successful the movie is sufficiently different (within a familiar framework) to earn a recommendation. This is not the ultimate romantic comedy - the one that makes you fall as hard for the characters as they do for one another while savoring their every interaction - but it seems fresher and less recycled than much of the product out there. [Whoever punctuated the title is either trying to send a message (which escapes me) or is illiterate. Considering the education level of some of the people working in Hollywood its a 50/50 proposition. To avoid confusion I will hereafter refer to the movie simply as Crazy Stupid Love leaving out the commas and period.] Crazy Stupid Love is an ensemble not unlike Love Actually but with a smaller group of characters and firmer narrative connective tissue. One problem is that the script favors certain individuals over others resulting in screen time inequities for the various romances. There are instances when Crazy Stupid Love focuses exclusively on one couple for a long stretch of time before seemingly remembering that the story isnt only about them. Whether this is a flaw in Dan Fogelmans screenplay or in the way co-directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa interpreted it it gives the movie an uneven jumpy flow and can be frustrating for viewers who care most about the characters who vanish for lengthy periods of time. The one constant is Cal (Steve Carrell) a man whose 25-year marriage to high school sweetheart Emily (Julianne Moore) collapses during one horrible evening when she makes two pronouncements (1) she has slept with another man (Kevin Bacon) and (2) she wants a divorce. Shellshocked Cal moves out of the house and begins spending his evenings in a cocktail longue looking but not touching. There he meets ladys man Jacob (Ryan Gosling) who decides to take the pathetic middle-aged guy under his wing. He whirls Cal through a makeover montage (not quite as good as the spending spree in Joe vs. the Volcano) teaches him the ropes when it comes to picking up women then turns him loose. Cals first score is a wild sexy teacher named Kate (Marisa Tomei) but shes only the first of many. Cal also unwittingly becomes involved in a romantic triangle featuring his 17-year old babysitter Jessica (Analeigh Tipton) and his 13-year old son Robbie (Jonah Bobo). Jessica harbors a secret crush on Cal while Robbies feelings for Jessica are less concealed. Meanwhile Jacob finds himself hooked on a sassy redhead named Hannah (Emma Stone); he craves her but shes having no part of him. Crazy Stupid Love offers two messages. The film espouses the concept that everyone has a single soulmate and the objective in life is to find that person and build a life with them. This being a romantic comedy its not hard to mix and match the appropriate men and women. Hint neither Kevin Bacon nor Marisa Tomei ends up with a partner. The movie also emphasizes that more than love is necessary for a long-term relationship to work and even among the most devoted couples routine and a lack of passion can dry things up. (Oddly this is also a central theme in The Change-Up.) The Cal/Emily dynamic is unusual for romantic comedies and based on the screen time accorded to it is more important to the filmmakers than the other relationships. Having middle-aged married leads represents a box office challenge but those qualities are what make Cal and Emily interesting. Theyre well past the Honeymoon Phase. Their love has fired in the kiln of a quarter century of togetherness. They have far more at stake than the usual rom-com protagonists. The Jacob/Hannah pairing is a throw-in for twentysomethings and the dance between Jessica and Robbie is for teens. In keeping with his recent career trajectory toward more serious roles Steve Carrell is allowed to play Cal mostly straight with the character presented sympathetically rather than as the butt of a barrage of easy jokes. It wouldnt be a challenge to transform Cal into a caricature but that would undermine the movie. Julianne Moore is a beautiful woman and she gives a lovely nuanced performance that exhibits different levels of pain and regret. It would be fair to say that Moore and Carrell have chemistry but its deeper and more fertile than the combustible type that exists between most romantic comedy couples. Carrell and Moore are surrounded by interesting actors. Neither Ryan Gosling nor Emma Stone shines here but they fill their roles of the young madly-in-love couple with aplomb. They are attractive and likeable and thats how its meant to be. Relative newcomers Analeigh Tipton and Jonah Bobo effectively navigate the choppy waters of a potentially reciprocated crush between a 13-year old and his babysitter. Finally Kevin Bacon and Marisa Tomei make the most of their limited screen time injecting straight comedy into a movie that occasionally comes close to losing its sense of humor. That humor rarely rises above the level of mild amusement. There is an exception - a brilliantly executed instance of screwball comedy - but a lot of the jokes are buried in a surprisingly thick layer of melodrama. Warner Brothers marketing department cherry-picked some of the sharpest lines for the trailer but (in a reversal of whats often true) they arent as funny in context. Crazy Stupid Loves uncertain marriage of dramatic elements with comedic ones contributes to the uneven flow. Fortunately the actors and the emotions they convey are believable enough for this to succeed as a good-natured feel-good diversion. Crazy Stupid Love.

"Crazy Stupid Love review Well-crafted date-night movie offers an abundance of strange dating scenarios |       NJ.com comments Crazy Stupid Love review Well-crafted date-night movie offers an abundance of strange dating scenarios Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on July 29 2011 at 802 AM updated July 29 2011 at 337 PM View/Post Comments Warner Bros. Steve Carell and Julianne Moore lead an unusually strong cast in ""Crazy Stupid Love."" Cal Weaver and his wife Emily are at a restaurant trying to figure out what dessert to share when they realize they want really different things. Cal for example would like the creme brulee. Emily would like a divorce. Thats the big joke in the trailer for ""Crazy Stupid Love"" and one of the first laughs in the movie. But the humor doesnt end there and neither does the story which -- like love itself -- gets well complicated. Because Cal moves out -- and is taken under the wing of Jacob a tireless womanizer who is determined to teach the older man as that mail-order book used to promise ""How to Pick Up Girls."" Meanwhile in between lessons Jacob is falling for Hannah a hard-to-get redhead who is so not his type she inevitably is. And Cals tween son is crushing on his babysitter -- who in turn pines secretly for Cal. ""Crazy Stupid Love"" is like the ""Inception"" of romantic comedies with several love stories spanning three different generations all going on at once. Go out for popcorn once and youre lost. But the cast is so winning you wont want to leave your seat. Movie Review Crazy Stupid Love (PG-13) Warner Bros. (118 min.) Directed by Glenn Ficarra John Requa. With Steve Carell Julianne Moore Ryan Gosling Emma Stone. Now playing in New Jersey. Rating note The film contains sexual situations strong language alcohol abuse and comic violence. Stephen Whittys Review THREE STARS As Cal Steve Carell does another one of his decent squares (hes like the husband in ""Date Night"" -- but as if that life-changing date night never happened). Hes particularly good in the quiet moments here like the painful drive home from that opening-scene dinner. Hes also challenged and charged by Ryan Gosling an excellent actor who leaves behind the loons and losers hes played lately -- like the foundering husband in the truly terrific ""Blue Valentine"" -- to play the slick sun-burnished Lothario who tutors Cal in seduction. Theyre in turn partnered by a number of fun actresses including the endearingly quirky Emma Stone as Hannah the always lovely Julianne Moore as Cals cheating wife and -- with just a few ferocious scenes she makes the most of -- Marisa Tomei as one of Cals conquests. ""Crazy Stupid Love"" is good enough that you wish it were a little better. There are some plot twists which rely more on coincidence than anything else and some corny slapstick violence. Some of the jokes about adolescent sexuality feel a little pervy. But the actors are perfect and directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa have several nice sequences including one in which we see Cal honing his bar-chat technique and another in which that shy little thing he brings home turns out to be anything but. During a summer when most of the other romantic comedies havent been either ""Crazy Stupid Love"" provides a fairly smart and sensible date-night choice.

P Warner Bros. Picture Steve Carell and Julianne Moore in ""Crazy Stupid Love."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Youre the perfect combination of sexy and cute"" is the invincible pickup line for Ryan Goslings ladykiller character in ""Crazy Stupid Love."" That fits the movies delightfully contradictory qualities too. Its romantic touching a little risque and screwball yet reassuringly down-to-earth. At the center of things is bland pleasant Cal the human equivalent of Muzak (Steve Carell playing it straight and never better). Over a dull date-night dinner his wife of 30 years Emily (Julianne Moore) announces that shes having an affair and demands a divorce. Cal shellshocked steps out of their moving car on the way home landing hard on the rocky road of midlife singlehood. Soothing his bruises with meat-market vodka-and-cranberry Cal wins the sympathetic attention of pickup king Jacob (Gosling). He teasingly tutors the 50-year-old near-virgin in the ways of courtship circa 2011. Yet this is no mismatched-buddies bro comedy. Dan Fogelman (writer of the ingeniously funny cartoons ""Bolt"" and ""Tangled"") adds appeal to the premise through multigenerational complications. The movie includes several whammies guaranteed to leave your jaw on the floor. The story expands to include Emilys midlife crisis and her halfhearted romance with an accountant colleague (Kevin Bacon) who promises to become a duplicate copy of the sweet bland bore she has just fled. Enchantingly saucy fledgling lawyer Hannah (the always-exemplary Emma Stone) accompanies a friend to the pickup bar becoming the only woman to resist Jacobs precision-honed come-ons and thus the one who captures his playboy heart. Old pro Marisa Tomei makes a big mark in a brief role as Cals overenthusiastic first hookup. Young Jonah Bobo gives an attractive unforced turn as the divorcing couples lovesick 13-year-old and as his wallflower baby sitter Minnetonka native Analeigh Tipton delivers a performance that is a sustained feat of magic. Unless I miss my guess this huge-eyed coltish beauty will be a very big thing in short order. I wont say more about the plot and what I have told so far isnt what really matters. The film emphasizes character and emotional values over jokes for their own sake. What makes the movie so interesting are the small incidents -- offhand exchanges where ironic banter contains the odd lance of stinging truth little moments of life observed in telling and persuasive detail. Every significant character in the film is forging a new life in a new world where the old certainties and simplicities and optimism about happily-ever-after are outdated a dilemma presented with amusement and chagrin. The movie is at its best when the cast is trying to shinny up the greased pole of romantic frustration. The conventionally sentimental and warmhearted ending feels misjudged a forgivable flaw in a work full of carefully observed life. As the woebegone Mr. Average Carell has a wonderful way of scrunching up his face into a smile of agony while Gosling shows a sly knack for comedy as the Top Gun of the singles scene. Stone has a wonderful sort of charm the gift of conferring excitement onto whatever takes her interest and making that enthusiasm contagious. Theres a scene in a wine shop where she sneaks up behind Gosling and bites his shoulder as if it was a peach. You think ""That must have hurt and it must have felt great."" The film is funny throughout but it has something better a kind of rambunctious authenticity that quietly infiltrates your heart. You leave the film with the feeling of having made four or five interesting new friends. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

(Ben Glass/AP/Warner Bros) Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone in a scene from ""Crazy Stupid Love.""(Ben Glass/AP/Warner Bros) Film review Crazy Stupid Love Smart sweet funny Add to ... Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jul. 29 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 240PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English That most conservative of genres the typical romcom follows formula as blindly as gravity obeys laws. But not Crazy Stupid Love which much like crazy stupid love is too erratic to play completely by the rules. Instead its the mild exception that makes if not for a great movie then at least for a pleasant surprise. And in the dog days of summer when the heat soars and standards droop anything pleasant is a three-star treat. In this film publicity image released by Warner Bros. Pictures Ryan Gosling left and Emma Stone are shown in a scene from Crazy Stupid Love. Warner Bros. Pictures Ben Glass/AP video Video Cowboys aliens and crazy stupid love Movies Crazy Stupid Love The official trailer The opening scene is the push-button ignition for everything that follows a clear-cut case of love grown lazy and lost. The camera neatly tells the story peering beneath the tables at an upscale restaurant to find the feet of the long-married couple - hers stylishly shod in pumps his way too comfortably encased in New Balance sneakers. Once upon a time Cal (Steve Carell) and Emily (Julianne Moore) were childhood sweethearts. Now as they peruse the dessert menu he wants creme brulee and she wants a divorce. The drive back home pits her chatty need to explain against his stunned silence. After all she remains his ""soulmate"" and the only woman hes ever known. For him the romance never ended; for us the comedy is set to begin. Indeed back at the house love lost gives way to love unrequited. Seems Robbie their 13-year old son has a massive crush on Jessica the older teenage babysitter an infatuation discovered when she accidentally sees him engaged in a vigorous session of self-pleasure. ""I think of you the whole time"" he proudly chirps. To complicate matters Jessica has her own unlikely crush on the entirely oblivious Cal. Meanwhile over at the hip bar where the jilted hubby will soon repair to drown his sorrows every lovely in the place has a crush on Jacob the ladies man (Ryan Gosling) a bespoke Casanova who scores so easily it takes the contest right out of the game. His only strike-out is with Hannah (Emma Stone) a graduating lawyer whose boyfriend embodies that other grade of love - not crazy and stupid but tepid and safe. Well already you can see that the ensemble cast is crowded and the script bouncing from entanglement to entanglement is awfully busy. However with a few notable exceptions co-directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa adroitly navigate the thickets. Some of their paths are conventional like the one that sees Jacob meeting Cal in the bar taking pity on him and then ushering in the inevitable makeover montage - new duds new do and after a few false steps a hot night with Kate the horny teacher (a hyper Marisa Tomei chewing more than the scenery). Standard too is the classic recognition scene initially enlivened by a nifty twist but soon deadened under a thick layer of physical shtick just the usual forced hilarity. Yet scattered among the miscues are those pleasant surprises. The biggest is this Frequently the zaniness stops and some genuinely impressive acting breaks out. The accomplished Moore is an obvious candidate and even in a confined role she delivers - here a nervous look there a tender gesture. Cast against type his customarily troubled characters Gosling is all dressed up (and occasionally undressed) in a fashion guaranteed to set hearts aflutter. But the guy is too skilled to settle for a hunky stereotype; rather he rescues the roue from cliche by adding a certain delicacy a repressed yet palpable sensitivity. Watch him in the set-piece with the suddenly aggressive Hannah where he makes Jacobs transition from seducer to seduced wonderfully and wittily credible. And listen too because Stones aural signature is there to enjoy that deep barking infectious laugh. Although not in their performing league Carell is blessed to have a faint hint of Buster Keaton in his otherwise handsome face - a mug whose deadpan stare is fraught with comic nuance. Even the kid actor is a cut above here. Jonah Bobo brings to Robbie that adolescent knack of travelling at warp speed from deep cynicism to idealistic innocence. Sure the dull climax brings us back to earth and bouncing about as it does Crazy Stupid Love seems at times like a bunch of movies searching for an identity. Happily some of them are actually worth watching.

(Handout) Elizabeth Weitzman Friday July 29 2011 400 AM Title Crazy Stupid Love. With Steve Carell Julianne Moore Ryan Gosling. Romantic dramedy about a couple considering divorce. Directors Glenn Ficarra John Requa (158). PG-13 Language sexuality. At area theaters.Comfort food with a kick ""Crazy Stupid Love"" closely follows the familiar recipe for a traditional dramedy. But directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa along with screenwriter Dan Fogelman add just enough wit to spice everything up.When we meet fortysomething couple Cal (Steve Carell) and Emily (Julianne Moore) theyre sitting at dinner wondering what they want next. Since Cal is thinking creme brulee hes stunned when Emily suggests a divorce instead.While drinking his woes away at a local bar he catches the eye of a slick player named Jacob (Ryan Gosling). Jacob takes pity on this middle-aged sad sack and offers to turn him into the kind of guy who could attract any woman.A few lessons later Cal has enough confidence to seduce a beautiful teacher (Marisa Tomei). But his teenage son (Jonah Bobo) keeps pushing him to come home and Emily doesnt seem very happy with her new boyfriend (Kevin Bacon) either. Meanwhile Jacob starts having second thoughts about his own shallow lifestyle especially once Hannah (Emma Stone) enters the picture.Its hard to ignore the fact that very little in the movie feels true -- no one clicks as a couple and there are carefully contrived coincidences around every corner.Some of these work better than others one familial twist is inspired while a subplot with an underage baby-sitter (Analeigh Tipton) edges close to creepy.Also are women really as desperate as Fogelman thinks? Given his arrogance and cheesy pickup lines the only thing Jacob actually has going for him is that he looks like Ryan Gosling.But while the filmmakers bungle the romance they handle the comedy with skillful precision. I laughed all the way through thanks to both consistently clever dialogue and deft delivery from Carell and Gosling who clearly relished a chance to flex his comic muscles.Its a shame the other actors dont fare as well. Moore Bacon and Stone are solid but oddly underused while Tomei overplays her comic moments. Even so any Hollywood dramedy thats neither crazy nor stupid deserves appreciation if not our unconditional love.

Starring Steve Carell Ryan Gosling Julianne Moore Emma Stone Running time 158 Release Opened Jul 29 2011  Editorial Review Facing a midlife rom-com crisisBy Ann HornadayFriday July 29 2011Steve Carell seems to be making a bid to be the next Tom Hanks which makes sense for any actor navigating his way out of the TV and comedy ghettoes but which is also fraught with danger. In recent years Hanks has deigned to accept only roles that cast him as a paragon of integrity and soft-spoken heroism shrewdly pruning his on-screen myth while carefully maintaining a persona of utter guilelessness. Carell teeters on the brink of the same kind of self-congratulatory career-molding in ""Crazy Stupid Love"" in which he basically resurrects his ""40-Year-Old Virgin"" character recasting him as a long-married man who plunges into the dating scene after sleeping with only one woman for 25 years. The movie opens with a clever montage of couples feet engaging in all manner of furtive flirtation under restaurant tables. When the camera lands on Cal Weaver (Carell) and his wife Emily (Julianne Moore) their troubles are clear. Shes wearing come-hither heels while Cal is decked out in shlumpy New Balance sneakers. In other words shes still trying but Cal has given up which accounts for why Emily announces at that same restaurant that she wants a divorce (while he was thinking creme brulee). He numbly agrees moves out of their comfortable house and into a depressing bachelor pad and begins hitting a singles bar where he comes under the tutelage of serial seducer Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling) a playah Pygmalion who takes Cal on as a personal makeover project. ""Im going to help you rediscover your manhood"" Jacob tells Cal. ""Do you have any idea when you lost it?"" ""A strong case can be made for 1984"" Cal replies wanly. What ensues is the kind of smooth fitfully funny finely machined romantic comedy that is expertly calibrated to hit all the rom-com happy places. Cal and Jacob make an appealing bromantic couple with Gosling especially alluring as a lithe self-regarding tomcat - its a given that Gosling is a great actor (yes great Watch ""The Believer"" ""Half Nelson"" and ""Blue Valentine"" if you dont believe me) which means he knows the secret to comedy is playing it straight. Although ""Crazy Stupid Love"" is nominally about Cal (revealingly its the first movie Carell has produced and the first he has starred in since leaving ""The Office"") its best scenes feature sex-on-a-stick Gosling especially when Jacob meets a lawyer named Hannah (Emma Stone) who may be the first woman with congenital immunity to his charms. It would be dishonest to say theres no humor or outright pleasure to be had in ""Crazy Stupid Love"" especially at the hands of Gosling whose seductive command presence suggests we may have found our next George Clooney. And there are universal human foibles and truths at its heart especially having to do with the midlife ennui that can torpedo the strongest marriage as well as the abiding theme of men grappling with a slipping sense of self. But where that subject was tackled by characters who were somewhat recognizable in say ""Win Win"" the world of ""Crazy Stupid Love"" is as ersatz as the satirical movie-within-a-movie in ""Friends With Benefits"" (another more believable film) where palm trees popped out from behind fake Manhattan backdrops and Jason Segel uttered catchphrases such as ""I guess New York is all out of blueberries."" Admittedly ""Crazy Stupid Love"" takes place in California so the palm trees are legit. But especially in its screwball third act what the filmmakers clearly meant to be sweet and lighthearted instead too often feels forced contrived and hopelessly banal (""I dont know when you and I stopped being us "" Emily says at one point). In one of the films several subplots Cals son Robbie (Jonah Bobo) develops a crush on an older woman a scenario that recalls ""Rushmore"" in its bittersweet comic potential. But here its no more than a way to drive home the films threadbare theme - if you find your soulmate fight for her - rather than delve into any genuinely new or quirky terrain of human behavior. Of course Hollywood has never been about reality - especially during the summer when comic book escapism rules the narrative roost - but adult dramas and comedies should at least have a toe in their audiences lives. With its contrived setups preposterous coincidences and calculated sentimentalism ""Crazy Stupid Love"" seems beamed from the same alternate reality as ""Larry Crowne"" (directed by and starring none other than Tom Hanks). We might enjoy the ride while were on it but it will seem like a visit to another planet once were home.

Pity the crowds expecting another cute comedy like ""Date Night"" who wind up at ""Crazy Stupid Love."" Itll be like asking for a burger and getting served escargot. The opening images set the pace for this fraught bruised comedy of manners Couples at a sexy restaurant play footsie under the table. But Cal (Steve Carell) and Emily (Julianne Moore) are not footwear-bonking. One reason is theyve been married 25 years. Another Hes wearing soiled New Balance sneakers. For dessert he wants a creme brulee; shell have the divorce please. Movies aim to be outrageous to flatter the audience that it is as off-the-hook as events unspooling before them. Cal is like most of us terribly on-the-hook and this movies quiet but frequently stinging comedy comes from facing up to ordinary life in all its shabby frustration. The lack of flattery makes the film gutsy and piquant a mood enhanced by an uncommonly touching score full of woozy indie songs. Even the cool guy (Ryan Gosling) who helps Cal learn some game with the ladies (Emily is the only woman hes ever slept with) is a walking slice of mortadella a smarmy poser in a black shirt and matching handkerchief. He probably thinks ""Night at the Roxbury"" was a documentary. PHOTOS ACTORS PRODUCING THEIR OWN MOVIES Cal retreats to one of those cinderblock Motel 6/Divorced Dads Quarters you see by strip malls commences major wardrobe renovations and has meaningless sex with an alcoholic (Marisa Tomei). Meanwhile his eighth-grade son (Jonah Bobo) stages increasingly weird displays of affection for his high-school-age baby sitter (Analeigh Tipton) -- who in turn thinks Cal is dreamy. Cal isnt interested. So instead of providing raunchy moments shes like Mena Suvari in ""American Beauty"" -- deluded and fragile. Cal begins to try to creep back into his familys life in quietly mad ways He sneaks into the yard at night to do a little pruning. But while hes there Emily calls -- claiming she needs to be coached about turning on the pilot light. In reality she just wants to hear his voice. Both sides look hopeless but the laughter here is tender and understanding driven by compassion instead of scorn. That isnt the tone I was expecting from directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa who wrote two of the most hilarious and profane comedies of the last decade (""Bad Santa"" and ""I Love You Phillip Morris"") but who are this time using a script by Dan Fogelman who wrote ""Cars."" With this movie they move up a bit into Judd Apatow territory (just as a few years ago Apatow got so big he became an adjective at least in The New Yorker ""Apatovian""). Carell playing this sad stuck but ever-hopeful man with tenderness and insight shows again (as he did in ""Little Miss Sunshine"") that he is the kind of actor who has an Oscar in his future. Moore on the other hand doesnt have much to do except utter movie cliches that Cal gets to morbidly swat down. She says she doesnt know ""when you and I stopped being us"" and he replies ""Maybe its when you screwed David Lindhagen."" Also there are occasional flat stretches and in its care to flesh out six principal characters the movie feels a little long. There is a reason for that Its heading for a big plot payoff that also provides an opportunity for some cathartic slapstick. The grown-up attitude and novelistic eye for everyone border on treasonous for Hollywood (even the marriage-shattering David Lindhagen played by Kevin Bacon isnt a caricature). Warner Brothers which has also released such daring comedies as ""Observe and Report"" should be given credit for releasing and heavily promoting the film. Perhaps only one other studio the Apatow-linked Universal (which did ""Bridesmaids"" and ""Funny People"") would have tolerated so little pandering -- and so much antipandering. Many viewers will realize (perhaps angrily) that they are the man in the New Balance sneakers or -- worse -- that their husbands are. Or that as babysitters they were pimply and ignorant not seductive and in control. Thats funny though We all like to think we lead ""The Hangover"" lives as we place the paper towels in the shopping cart. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Bridesmaids director says he is open to a sequel Read Next Bridesmaids director says he is open to a sequel Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 44665 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 21991 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops 16058 Cop in bikini tackles bad guy Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Thats one of the reasons love is crazy and stupid you see. Another reason is that love has this habit of looking pathetic until you fall into it and then you cant see how you were ever opposed to it. See? Crazy. And stupid. Those are the observations made by the film a multi-threaded and well-organized comedy full of pleasant surprises and appealing characters. Perhaps most surprising is the movies provenance It was written by Dan Fogelman who has worked mostly on childrens films (Cars Bolt Fred Claus) and directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa who wrote the naughty Bad Santa before making the darkly comic I Love You Phillip Morris. Crazy Stupid Love lies at the intersection of those paths a PG-13 story for grown-ups with a hint of subversiveness and a lot of sweetness. It begins with good-hearted family man Cal Weaver (Steve Carell) learning that his wife of nearly 25 years Emily (Julianne Moore) wants a divorce. She has been unhappy for a while and has recently slept with a co-worker David Lindhagen whose name comes to be the movies favorite swear word like Seinfelds ""Newman."" Wounded and sad Cal dutifully moves out of the house and into a condo. While moping and drinking in an upscale cocktail lounge one night the pitiable Cal draws the attention of Jacob (Ryan Gosling) an impossibly smooth and sharply dressed ladies man who can take a different girl home with him every night if he chooses to (and he does choose to). Jacob finds Cals pathetic dishevelment and dorky fashion sense fascinating. ""I dont know if I should help you or if I should euthanize you"" he says. He opts for the former and gives Cal one of those dress-and-grooming makeovers that movies love so much in addition to supplying him with guidelines on how to pick up women. But this is not just a smooth-guy-helps-nerd-find-love comedy thank goodness. Jacobs tutorial is effective in its way -- Cal finds a woman (Marisa Tomei) who admires his desperate honesty -- but thats accomplished while the movie is still young. Meanwhile Jacob himself is in pursuit of his Great White Whale Hannah (Emma Stone) a law student who is so far the only woman to resist his charms. (She has a sappy boyfriend amusingly played by Josh Groban whom shes considering settling for.) The last thing Jacob wants is to fall in love but hes intrigued by the idea of someone who wont sleep with him. Then theres Cal and Emilys 13-year-old son Robbie (Jonah Bobo) who is madly in love with his babysitter 17-year-old Jessica (Analeigh Tipton) and tells her so. She wants nothing to do with a 13-year-old obviously -- and besides shes secretly in love with Robbies dad. So theres another coupling that isnt ever gonna happen. Maybe were so accustomed to formulas that any slight deviation seems remarkable but the way Crazy Stupid Love veers from the beaten path is well remarkable. You could make a good movie out of the Jacob/Cal story each man teaching the other something about love and romance each eventually finding his way and so forth. But Fogelmans witty astute screenplay gives us more than that. The characters youd expect to be supporting ones like Hannah and Emily and the teenagers are fully developed and their stories are given due attention. The movie expands from a two-man piece into an ensemble affair. Carell funny as usual is the more restrained version of himself here -- more Dan in Real Life than Date Night. Weve seen that before and we like it. Gosling on the other hand is breaking new ground. In perusing his IMDb page Im astonished to realize that he has never starred in a comedy before. And yet here he is giving his suave sensitive persona a hilarious tweak as an unflappably confident pickup artist who winds up having some depth too. Emma Stone who ought to be a bigger star than she is continues to charm my socks off; Julianne Moore helps us sympathize with Emily whos hurting over the break-up almost as much as Cal is; the kids Jonah Bobo and Analeigh Tipton are confident performers; and hey theres Kevin Bacon as the oily David Lindhagen. After being quite smitten with the first 75 percent of the movie I feared all was lost when suddenly the plot threads began to converge in a contrived and farcical manner into one of those ""theyre on a collision course with wackiness"" scenarios. And then somehow the ship righted itself -- only to go off-course again with a gooey disappointing formulaic finale. But most of the film rings true reflecting all the humor and tragedy to be found in that crazy stupid emotion. Grade B+ Movies Crazy Stupid Love.

Starring Steve Carell Ryan Gosling Julianne Moore and Emma Stone. Directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa. (PG-13. 118 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Men will watch ""Crazy Stupid Love"" thinking theyre finding out things about women but if anything this movie works the other way. Women will get a glimpse into the male mind. So we have a newly separated man whose wife has cheated on him getting lessons in how to attract women a plot element predicated on an almost universally held male belief that there are surefire secrets to be learned in this area. Its not simply a matter of chance that there are some guys that women just like. No its a matter of learning how to dress and what to say. And when its Steve Carell doing the learning and Ryan Gosling doing the teaching there is the basis here for good comedy. ""Crazy Stupid Love"" aspires to be more than funny too to mix laughs with serious observation with scenes showing the wronged husband coming into his authority and the local lothario (Gosling) discovering his heart. There the results are mixed. The movies almost two-hour running time makes it almost as long as a Judd Apatow entry without the same degree of insight or force. ""Crazy Stupid Love"" doesnt quite feel all of a piece and there are awkward places in the plotting particularly near the finish. Yet it remains entertaining and more than that involving in the sense that we never doubt or lose interest in the central situation - that of a middle-aged man (Carell) forced to reassess himself and his world. Carell carries the comedy while remaining grounded in the pain of the character and so we care. Its also astonishing what good clothes and a haircut can do for a guy. Theres a lesson in that for all of us. Directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa and written by Dan Fogelman ""Crazy Stupid Love"" subscribes to a very male notion that if your wife leaves you the best way to get her respect is to have sex with nine women in quick succession. Being male myself I would not necessarily argue with that idea - though equating romantic success with personal value means placing so much pressure on oneself that failure is almost guaranteed. Related Stories So Crazy it might work Review Crazy Stupid Love. Julianne Moore as the estranged wife does her best to be sympathetic though its hard to forgive her. Marisa Tomei has more fun in a featured role as a one-night stand. In a parallel story the movie follows a newly minted lawyer played by Emma Stone a young actress Im starting to worry about. Every publication these days is proclaiming her stardom before its happened and thats the recipe for a Julia Ormond-like fall. Yet based on her confidence her comic timing her idiosyncratic good looks and manner she deserves the career everyone is predicting. E-mail Mick LaSalle at mlasallesfchronicle.com.

By Joe Morgenstern July 29 2011 A romantic comedy of intertwined lives overlapping dialogue and multiple themes--no wonder the filmmakers had their well-publicized problems finding a title--""Crazy Stupid Love"" has more naked contrivances than naked bodies. (Its actually quite innocent despite a facade of edgy sophistication.) For all its implausible twists and turns though the film which was directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa fills its scenes with bright surprises while making an appealing new case for the old-fashioned notion of soul mates. The precipitating event is an unmating. After two decades of ostensibly happy marriage Cal Weaver (Steve Carell) an earnest suburbanite for whom stylish leisure wear means New Balance sneakers discovers that his wife Emily (Julianne Moore) has been unfaithful and wants a divorce. That promises fidelity to a formulaic plot and to Mr. Carells familiar wistfulness. But Dan Fogelmans script takes an abrupt turn to a trendy club where a younger and supremely self-assured womanizer named Jacob (Ryan Gosling) takes pity on the verbosely morose Cal enlists him as his wingman sets out to make him over into a stud and instructs him in the not-so-niceties of the dating game. Why would Jacob do this? Dont ask. If he didnt thered be no movie and no pretext for him pursuing one of the movies main themes ""Im going to help you rediscover your manhood"" he announces to Cal. ENLARGE Kevin Bacon John Carroll Lynch Ryan Gosling and Steve Carell in Crazy Stupid Love. Warner Bros. Pictures Youd expect Mr. Carell to be funny in the pick-up attempts that ensue and he certainly is. The revelation is Mr. Goslings comic chops which come with a gift for tossing off smart lines at impressively high speed. Better still he finds his perfect counterpart in Emma Stone who was sensational as the self-ironic star of ""Easy A"" and is equally so this time in a smaller role that she transforms into a very big deal. She plays Hannah a young woman seemingly set to become one more of Jacobs conquests until they repair to his elegant home. Then they share their huge pleasure with each other in an extended sequence that feeds on the logic of love and grows into the films scintillating centerpiece. Apart from that sequence with its slow build and lovely development ""Crazy Stupid Love"" feeds on the logic of a patchwork quilt--exuberant set pieces punchy vignettes life lessons (seize the initiative be true to yourself fight for what you want) and secret loves that reveal themselves in a climax crazed by design and chaotic beyond measure. Yet the movie also fights for what it wants--to touch us in the course of entertaining us --and it succeeds with its zinger-studded script that transcends clumsy mechanics and a spirited cast that includes Marisa Tomei as a nymphomaniacal middle-school teacher and Jonah Bobo as a lovesick eighth-grader. I checked to see if Master Bobo is really as young as his character and indeed he is but youd never know it from his performance which is eerily witty and scarily wise. The Devils Double Watch a clip of ""Devils Double"" about the man who was forced to become the double of Saddam Husseins son. A special pleasure of the movie medium is watching actors play double or multiple roles Lee Marvin in ""Cat Ballou"" Jeremy Irons in ""Dead Ringers"" Peter Sellers doing three characters in ""Dr. Strangelove"" Alec Guinness doing eight in ""Kind Hearts and Coronets""--the list is long and goes back to the movies earliest days. In this latest example Dominic Cooper is both Uday Hussein the notorious (and happily dead) son of the Iraqi dictator and Udays former classmate Latif Yahia a peaceable Iraqi army lieutenant forced into soul-smothering servitude as Udays ""fiday"" or body double. The dual aspect of Mr. Coopers performance is immensely enjoyable and the film directed by Lee Tamahori--from Michael Thomass adaptation of an autobiographical book by Mr. Yahia--leaves no doubt about Udays vileness. Its star creates a new pinup for the gallery of human perversion a coke-snorting psychopath with a piping voice who fairly vibrates with delight at the depth of his own depravity. ENLARGE Dominic Cooper in The Devils Double. Lionsgate Entertainment Thats the constant in Udays psyche even though his mood may change from one second to the next. Instead of evils banality Mr. Cooper gives us the elation generated by Udays unmoored id as he plucks innocent schoolgirls off a Baghdad street defiles a bride on her wedding day or slaughters his fathers whoremaster in a delirium of displaced rage. Those who admired Mr. Coopers work as Peter Sarsgaards dashing friend and business partner in ""An Education""--I called it ""a supporting performance with star quality""--could not have imagined his achievement here. His remarkable range includes the subtlety of his scenes as Latif as well as Udays malign flamboyance. (Saddam Hussein appears occasionally making oracular pronouncements then vanishes.) ""You are asking me to extinguish myself"" Latif tells Uday at the outset. Thats true enough though Latif tries to function as the conscience of the unconscionable man he has the bad luck to resemble. But far from extinguishment Latif also starts to feel--from the first moment he bursts out of a hotel room in Udays character--the liberation that amorality can bring. The movie isnt deep or particularly intricate; it doesnt play all that much with the potential for mistaken identities and the cruelty it depicts becomes repetitive or worse still desensitizing. But ""The Devils Double"" does give us indelible images of Udays decadence--the filmmakers say theyre understated--and a double dip of dazzling acting. Cowboys amp; Aliens Watch a clip of Universal Pictures ""Cowboys and Aliens"". For the first half-hour this misbegotten mash-up of movie genres sticks to its six-shooters. A stranger comes to town in the Wild West of the late 19th century a mysterious and imposing stranger played by Daniel Craig. He must have a name but he cant remember it or anything else; his mind has been mysteriously wiped clean. Speaking barely above a whisper he evokes Clint Eastwoods Man With No Name. But hes a man with no charm in a movie with no verve whether its poking along in joyless homage to classic Westerns or losing its way amid digital swarms of generic extraterrestrials whove made a home base on the range while they plunder our planets gold. (Jon Favreau who mined rich veins of humor in the first ""Iron Man"" directed from a script that five writers adapted from a comic book.) Cowboys versus aliens is a concept that may make you smile in anticipation but wipe that smile off your face before buying your ticket because the film takes its subject seriously--deadly seriously in the case of Harrison Ford who plays a nasty rancher with the snarls and scowls that have become his trademarks as if in penance for being so charming in the past. One interesting twist has a posse of cowboys teaming up with the Apaches they fear in order to vanquish the aliens but the storytelling punctuated by incoherent flashbacks is often inscrutable Im still trying to figure out which side of the cosmos gave birth to the woman played by Olivia Wilde. Youll be glad to know that the good guys win though you may be offended as I was by the misplaced homage of the aliens rocket which blows up during a hasty departure. Its jagged trail precisely mimics the smoke plume from space shuttle Challengers doomed flight. Point Blank Watch a clip from ""Point Blank"" a French chase movie set in the subways and streets of Paris. If you lop off the closing credits of Fred Cavayes preposterously exciting--and pleasingly preposterous--French-language thriller the running time is a mere 80 minutes. Not since ""Run Lola Run"" has the term been used more aptly. Throughout ""Point Blank"" which starts with men running men plus at least one female cop run around and beneath the streets of Paris at a frantic pace. One of the two main runners is Samuel (Gilles Lellouche) a hospital nurses aide studying for his nursing certificate. Thanks to his not-so-random act of kindness--saving a patients life--Samuels pregnant wife is kidnapped and he must find her before shes killed. His companion a criminal named Sartet is played by Roschdy Zem a powerful actor I first admired in Rachid Boucharebs ""Days of Glory."" What links them is too intricate to explain here and why in any case wouldnt you want to find out on your own? Suffice it to say that the two men need one another--think ""The Defiant Ones"" without chains--and the climactic chase is complicated by a city-wide crime wave that turns into a crime tsunami. Watch a clip from ""Life in a Day"" a documentary compiled from footage shot all around the world depicting life on July 24 2010. Life in a Day Kevin Macdonalds documentary imposes a semblance of unity on a planet of unfathomable diversity. ""Life in a Day"" is a diary of life on Earth as recorded by videographers all over the world on the same day--July 24 2010--and uploaded to YouTube for subsequent winnowing and editing. (The editor was Joe Walker.) The film treats our species generously for the most part--no videos of troops firing on funeral processions though one segment depicts a cows demise in a slaughterhouse while another touches on Germanys Love Parade tragedy when 19 techno fans died during a stampede. Love of life suffuses the footage as it should. From his bed in a cardiac intensive care unit an elderly man struggles to express his gratitude for how well hes been treated. A boozer on a bench at dawn calls it ""the best day ever"" even though he must consult his cellphone for the date. A shoeshine boy loves his laptop for the information it brings. ""Its a Wikipedia"" the kid says gleefully. ""Its a giant library."" ENLARGE Virginia Salvado Segu one of the many ordinary people in Life in a Day. National Geographic Entertainment Does the film add up to something more than a stunt? Maybe not. I was captivated by the several hours I recently saw of Christian Marclays 24-hour-long ""The Clock"" a video mashup in which thousands of clips from hundred of movies contain watches and clocks telling the same time that spectators can read on their wrists. ""Life in a Day"" doesnt aspire to such intricacy but its fascinating all the same an electronic update of Alexander Popes maxim that the proper study of mankind is man. DVD FOCUS Fracture (2007) ENLARGE Ryan Gosling is Willy Beachum a young assistant district attorney in this battle of wits between men of matching arrogance. Anthony Hopkins is Willys adversary Ted Crawford a structural analyst for the airline industry whos been arrested for what may prove to be the perfect crime. By suggesting unplumbed depths while Willy is still navigating the shallows of careerism Mr. Gosling sets up his character for a heroism thats fueled in equal measure by shrewd thinking and clear feeling. Gregory Hoblit directed from a screenplay by Daniel Pyne and Glenn Gers. The cast includes Rosamund Pike and Cliff Curtis. Tamara Drewe (2010) One year after his appearance in ""An Education"" Dominic Cooper played a fatuous rock star in this bucolic frolic directed by Stephen Frears. (Moira Buffini adapted a graphic novel by Posy Simmonds which was in its turn a contemporary riff on Thomas Hardys ""Far From the Madding Crowd."") Gemma Arterton is Tamara who returns to the Wessex village of her birth with a cute new nose and newfound confidence to go with it. Once an ugly duckling known to the locals as Beaky she is now absurdly glamorous and given her erotic ambitions extremely dangerous. Casino Royale (2006) Daniel Craig became a star when he played James Bond in this thoroughly modern action epic that also functions as a prequel to all the others.

The moment speaks not just for the movie but also for a whole group of recent Clueless Guy Comedies. Of late weve seen liberated husbands trying to pick up women at Applebees (Hall Pass) boorish buddies rampaging through Bangkok (The Hangover Part II) and terrorized employees bumbling through attempts to murder their bosses (Horrible Bosses). Sorry dudes. It seems we cant do anything right but were still funny. Sometimes.Crazy Stupid Love stands apart in a few important respects. Its multivalent with several crisscrossing storylines that connect often enough to yield an emotional payoff. It has a couple of plum parts for women capably filled by Julianne Moore and the very busy Emma Stone (the forthcoming Help the just-released Friends With Benefits). Its not particularly ironic or smirk-infested. Like the previous movie from directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa I Love You Phillip Morris its not afraid of real emotion or at least a Hollywood version of it.A couple of hugely appealing leading men never hurt. Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling are the two troubled fellas. They meet at an extremely well-lighted and spacious bar after Cal (Carell) has been cuckolded by his wife (Moore). He actually uses the word ""cuckolded"" loud enough for most of the bar to hear. Finally slick ladies man Jacob (Gosling who looks like he locked himself in a gym for a few months and emerged as a capable funny man) gets sick of the whining and gives his new project a Queer Eye-style makeover. ""I dont know if I should help you or if I should euthanize you"" he laments before settling on the former.Shenanigans ensue some predictable some less so. Theres a slightly awkward subplot that finds Cals hyper-aware 13-year-old son (Jonah Bobo) lusting after the same babysitter (Analeigh Tipton) who lusts after Cal. Marissa Tomei finds nice slapstick notes in an unforgiving role as the first of Cals post-makeover conquests; Stone is vibrant and spontaneous as the woman who might make a decent man of Jacob and ends up at the center of an unforeseen twist.Ficarra and Requa here working with a script by Dan Fogelman are turning into architects of the stealth romantic farce. Beneath the patina of naughtiness (which sunk in deep with Bad Santa) is the blend of beating heart and instinct for the oversized moment that fueled the Hollywood comedies of a more innocent time. This makes them a fine match for Carell a self-effacing and open star who when he finds the right roles (The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Dan in Real Life come to mind) shines as a sensitive comic star. Of course hes also an excellent deadpan oblivious idiot when the occasion calls for it.Crazy Stupid Love is tender where so many current comedies are merely snide. Instead of carpet-bombing the theater with easy laughs it does something risky by telling an actual story with actual characters. What a concept.Crazy Stupid LoveB+ Starring Steve Carell Ryan Gosling Julianne Moore Emma Stone Kevin Bacon Marisa Tomei Analeigh Tipton Jonah Bobo and John Carroll Lynch.

"Crazy Stupid Love movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-LoveMovie review Crazy Stupid LoveThe romantic comedy and its stellar cast play out each of the titles three words to brilliant effect but its love in all its permutations that comes away with the starring role.July 29 2011|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Steve Carell and Julianne Moore star in ""Crazy Stupid Love."" (Warner Bros. Pictures )""Crazy Stupid Love"" is one from the heart and one for the heart. This grand romantic gesture about grand romantic gestures conjures up the bittersweet magic of first loves lasting loves lost loves and all the loves in between. It may well restore your faith in the very possibility of love to say nothing of romantic comedies. The sprawling cast that keeps hearts a theirs and yours a pitter-pattering is made up of a strong central core comprised of Steve Carell Julianne Moore Ryan Gosling Emma Stone Jonah Bobo and Analeigh Tipton. Given the general A+ efforts of the entire crew it doesnt feel right to single anyone out but I will and well get back to a few distinctive romantic ploys and plays in a bit. Because there is a mix of such sweet familiarity and surprising freshness in the story capped by a clever twist along the way I have to start with a nod to the writer Dan Fogelman. Unless you count the unfunny ""Fred Claus"" with Vince Vaughn and I dont Fogelmans best writing until now has been in animation with the taunting and tantalizing ""Tangled"" the high point. In ""Crazy Stupid Love"" hes come up with a script driven by realism without cynicism that is so winningly sentimental it is almost enough to turn that word into praise rather than the pejorative dig it has become. Directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa understand what a little gem theyve been given. The guys have been a creative team since film school specializing in comedy a 2003s ""Bad Santa"" was their cleverest and last years ""I Love You Phillip Morris"" their sweetest. Until ""Crazy."" Here theyve made the very best of both those worlds. They can always be counted on to bring a certain ease to their farces but in ""Crazy"" the fun flows absolutely effortlessly and almost endlessly with the slapstick only tripping them up occasionally. The film opens with Cal (Carell) and Emily (Moore) going through the motions of a date-night dinner at the moment trying to decide what else they might want before heading home. He chooses a dessert; she wants a divorce. Once the D-words on the table the first in a long string of emotional dominoes begins to fall. Its not just Cal and Emilys hearts that are on the line either. At home 13-year-old Robbie (Bobo) is fantasizing about his 17-year-old baby sitter Jessica (an excellent Tipton) who is fantasizing about Cal. The neighborhood bar where Cal lands after the blowup is home turf for Jacob (Gosling) a player always on the prowl who eventually takes pity on the suburban dad. Jacob is a little wounded too or at least surprised that none of his pickup lines has worked with a certain girl named Hannah (Stone). An underplayed Kevin Bacon and an overplayed Marisa Tomei (she really can do a lot more than hyper-sexuality) turn up as the main romantic temptations for the newly fractured couple. Now that all the plates are spinning as the title suggests everyone goes a little crazy which involves everyone getting a little stupid all in an effort to find love. The film is jam-packed with flavorful comic bits but Jacobs attempt to turn Cal into a player which includes a mall and a makeover is one of the best. Young Bobo holds his own among all the veterans as Robbie goes to Shakespearean extremes to woo Jessica. Meanwhile Tipton works wonders with the emotional churn of a teenagers desperate measures to tempt Cal. With all the chasing-after-love going on at times the film feels like a play done in rounds a starting slow then picking up speed until the action and the implications are piling up faster than you can keep track of. Then just as youre feeling dizzy everything slows down to allow you to savor a scene. The way in which the hookup between Goslings lothario and Stones smart but vulnerable Hannah turns into a slow flirt that reveals their interior amid all the sexual heat is just lovely. Often what makes the comedy work is the way it is played alongside the tragedy. Cal absorbing the fact that the high school sweetheart he married may not love him anymore comes with pratfalls but pain lives in those scenes too. Carell whos done such fine work for years in the acerbic series ""The Office"" has been hit-and-miss on the movie front. Excellent in ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" but otherwise not quite finding his footing either as a romantic lead a stumbling in ""Date Night"" with Tina Fey a or a silly goof A  la ""Dinner With Schmucks."" In ""Crazy"" hes found his sweet spot again the decent guy whos trying to do the right thing even when he makes a mess of it. Meanwhile Emma Stone (""Easy A"") is turning out to be the most refreshing of ""it"" girls ever a because of all the things she isnt. Her beauty is built on a nontraditional look that includes a lot of inner strength. Shes spicy instead of being just a sweet tart and shes always as smart as she is funny. All that plays off Goslings nuanced performance just about perfectly. As much as the movie is about couples and coupling it is also a film about families and the filmmakers find a way to give that its due as well. Because that is after all where true romance so often leads. Between the writing acting directing and the rest it works. Not crazy not stupid and filled with love.

Happily for the picture which is no great shakes but is both character-driven and smartly cast new title sequences have been substituted so that Steve Carell Julianne Moore Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling can court laughter in a somewhat more distinctive sounding Loco y Estupido Amor. Its the love thats stupid and crazy not the people (at least in Spanish; in English the titles second comma makes a hash of a meaning). This sort of positioning lets note is important. Just as in the land of the blind the one-eyed man is king in a genre where outright imbecility generally prevails a film investigating craziness and stupidity qualifies as a cut above and needs to signal its intentions to audiences. This one does so not just with a strong cast (filled out at the edges by the likes of Kevin Bacon Josh Groban and Marisa Tomei) but also with a veteran Disney/Pixar screenwriter (Dan Fogelman whos recently been responsible for such smart-alecky animated comedies as Bolt Tangled and Cars 2) and with directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa who first caught audience attention with their script for Bad Santa and are now hot off their idiosyncratic gay-conman romp I Love You Phillip Morris one of last years more subversively distinctive romances. That theyre all working a comparatively conventional vein of Hollywood rom-com in Crazy Stupid Love is disappointing but theyve managed to turn a bit of that convention on its ear in crafting an amusingly complex multi-generational romantic roundelay. Carell is Cal a nebbishy 40-something dad who married his high-school sweetheart (Moore) and is more than mildly startled when she announces during what he thinks is a romantic evening that shes dallied with a co-worker (Bacon) and wants a divorce. Cal repairs to the nearest bar drowning his sorrows noisily enough night after night that a younger almost alarmingly charming womanizer named Jacob (Gosling) eventually takes pity on him and offers him tips both social and sartorial. Jacobs a trust-fund smoothie whose practiced seductive patter (invariably ending with a cooed ""Lets get out of here"") scores effortlessly with the ladies and despite Cals doofus-y inexperience with a little tutoring and some better-fitting threads hes soon doing nearly as well. Alas Cals still smitten with his wife sneaking home after dark to surreptitiously water rose bushes and aerate the lawn while peering longingly through the window at his family (in the movies scheme of things this makes him loveable not a stalker). i As a cross-generational counterpoint to Cals shaken-up love life his romance tutor Jacob (Ryan Gosling) thinks himself a seduction sensei until he meets seemingly unseduceable law student Hannah (Emma Stone). Ben Glass/Warner Brothers hide caption toggle caption Ben Glass/Warner Brothers As a cross-generational counterpoint to Cals shaken-up love life his romance tutor Jacob (Ryan Gosling) thinks himself a seduction sensei until he meets seemingly unseduceable law student Hannah (Emma Stone). Ben Glass/Warner Brothers Jacob meanwhile is falling for an attractive law-school grad named Hannah (Stone) possibly because shes the only bar regular immune to his charms even as shes pining for a boss (Groban) who barely notices her. Perhaps knowing that movie audiences will recognize familiar rom-com tropes Fogelman peppers the dialogue with movie jokes -- Karate Kid references for Jacobs tutoring of Cal an MPAA ratings riff for Hannah as she interrupts Jacob in mid-seduction by articulating the difference between the R-rated evening shes signed on for and the PG-rated one shes afraid shell get. When traversing familiar territory might as well acknowledge the landmarks as we pass them. There are John Hughes-ish subplots too -- Cals 13-year-old son falls for his little sisters babysitter who has a crush on Cal who... oh never mind. Graceful playing aside the characters mostly remain ciphers which renders the comic twists (one or two of which are genuine doozies) more schematically than emotionally satisfying. Though Moores eyes are forever misting over at Carells puppy-dog act you never learn enough about their marriage to care much about whether they stay together. And though Gosling works overtime to invest Jacob with vulnerability the characters unconsidered womanizing makes him kind of a cold fish. By the time the films reaching its big plot-resolving set-pieces -- a backyard brawl and a graduation day speech -- everyones basically going through the farcical motions. Still grant the filmmakers the efficiency of their plotting even if it reduces characters to types. And credit them with having assembled a cast capable of making the films craziness and stupidity appealing even if hitching actors of the caliber of Moore and Gosling (and to a lesser extent Carell and Stone) to material this thin is a little like hitching a Saturn rocket to a go-cart.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + ""Crazy Stupid Love. has two commas and a period. Can that sentence be diagrammed? What are these words modifying? Is ""love a noun or a verb? Is the amount of punctuation in a movie title proportional to the pleasure to be found in the movie itself? The answers are ""I dont know ""I dont know ""I cant tell and ""evidently. Dan Fogelman wrote this romantic comedy which John Requa and Glenn Ficarra directed and they all appear to have a much firmer grip on genre than on punctuation (Requa and Ficarra actually left a comma off their previous movie ""I Love You Philip Morris in which Jim Carrey played a gay con man.)The new film is set in Los Angeles and is poised between the classical Hollywood screwball comedy and pretty good network-television situation comedy. This could be the season speaking but it feels in many ways like a romantic blockbuster. That period and two commas could easily be exclamation points since just about everything in this movie is absurdly overstated. When Emily Weaver (Julianne Moore) tells her dumpy husband Cal (Steve Carell) that she wants a divorce and has had an affair he casually hurtles from a door of the car shes driving. The Weavers 13-year-old-son Robbie (Jonah Bobo) tells his Olive Oyl-ly 17-year-old baby sitter Jessica (Analeigh Tipton) that he loves her even after shes caught him well thinking about her beneath his sheets. She of course is working up the courage to tell Cal she loves him. He doesnt notice her. He cant stop thinking about the man who slept with his wife. Requa and Ficarra encourage grand statements and enormous reactions. They want pyrotechnic feeling and their shamelessness works. It has no pretensions of depth just more feeling.A stone-and-chrome yuppie bar provides the frequent meeting place for half the characters. Its the Regal Beagle. Its Cheers. Its Central Perk. Its the bridge on the USS Enterprise. That bar also provides the germ of the movies steadily mounting farce. Its where Cal meets Jacob (Ryan Gosling) a dapper slut who out of boredom or the need for a broment takes Cal shopping for designer clothes that no longer make him look like a homeless math teacher.This is the rare movie that dares to take Carells handsomeness seriously to acknowledge that hes handsome at all. Even then hes not as effortlessly cool as Gosling who speaks more here than he has in his last five movies combined. The filmmakers have fun constructing scenes of him rolling his eyes at Carell as Jacob tries to teach Cal how to seduce a woman. Gosling has an innate remoteness that can be easily construed as aloof. Really its just matinee-idol mystery and rather than unpack it the movie recalibrates it. In at least one breezy montage Jacob plies a dozen women with his signature line ""Lets get out of here. He delivers it with obvious carnality and just enough gentleness and sincerity that by about the seventh time I started to get out of my seat and follow him home. Gosling is the most naturally sexual young actor the movies have. Requa and Ficarra mix him up in a lot of tired gags like having him spread his legs while talking naked to Carell in a gym locker room then having Carell pass out into his bare crotch in a sauna. Goslings charisma seems to thrive on the attention.The luckiest lady he meets is a lawyer played by Emma Stone who shows up at the bar with a girlfriend (Liza Lapira). And even before Gosling slinks over to promote himself you hope hell go for the quick-witted Lapira who deserves a movie of her own. But after an hour of narrative oscillation the film rests on a wonderful couple of scenes between Gosling and Stone in which her cup of quirkiness runneth over and he wins from her what every movie should that big raspy laugh.These two have a long talk in his stone-and-chrome house - apparently theres one architect in LA - during which you watch two people fall in love. Whats great about Gosling has nothing to do with whats great about Stone but the incongruity doesnt sink the movie. She complicates his virility with enough nerdiness to suit her piquant vestal air. He gets her to laugh. She gets him to snort.Even in that casting this is a movie that knows what were thinking. How could a comedy about a club-dwelling player not culminate in misogyny? But theres no hate in Gosling here. You know why every woman who leaves with him does so. Marisa Tomei swoops in and steals two scenes as a woman with an honesty fetish and that feels new too. Her second scene ends in embarrassment for Cal who watches dejected as her character along with Emily and a handful of onlookers walk away and it starts to rain. I reached for my notebook but before I could start scribbling Cal finished my thought ""What a cliche. The movie embraces and tries to upend them.It would have been easy for instance to make Emily some kind of brittle emasculator the way say Annette Bening was in ""American Beauty to name only a virtuosic example. But the character really is searching for something or someone that makes her happy and its not her husband. It might not even be the co-worker she slept with even though hes played by a Visine-clear Kevin Bacon whos so not creepy here that it creeped me out. Moore knows her range as a comedian and this movie gives her plenty to do simply with reaction shots and throwaway lines.Fogelman has written scripts for animated movies (""Tangled) and live-action cartoons (""Fred Claus) and theres a simple almost juvenile quality to this film in addition to its characters relentless agelessness which is pivotal to a rambunctious cleverly turned plot twist. The fun is in watching these robustly generic people trip over and pinball off of each other seeing them eddy around Carell who as the straight man here is getting dangerously close to Greg Kinnears territory - where comedy is too self-serious to laugh at. Hed do well to tread in the other direction. Still amid the bright broad cartoonishness Fogelman Requa and Ficarra are trying out a good idea about the cons and pros of human connection that along with outrageous misunderstanding comes the possibility for maturity that maybe all this talking will turn flailing grown-ups into full-blown adults.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Slideshow Crazy Stupid Love Premiere Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon More about Crazy Stupid Love >> Dan Fogelmans script isnt Shakespeare but the comic beats of one couple coming together as the other comes apart make for a lively quadrille. Add to this mating dance some others who cut in - Carells son (Jonah Bobo) has a crush on the babysitter (Analeigh Tipton charming) who has a crush on Carell - and you have A Midsummer Nights PG-13 sex comedy. Kicked to the curb by his faithless wife Emily schlumpy Cal (Carell) drowns his troubles at a swank Los Angeles club apparently peopled by supermodels who travel with their own backlighting. Its here that Jacob (Gosling) suave master of pickup artists takes the self-pitying Cal under his wing. ""I will help you rediscover your manhood"" promises Jacob whose diagnosis of Cals woman problem is that his baggy jackets are a size too large. Cue the makeover sequence. Gosling plays Jacob with peacocky self-assurance practiced opening gambit (flatter her with questions about herself) and capture-the-queen move (""Wanna get outta here?""). This works on every woman he meets - except for the self-possessed Hannah (Stone) a law student who correctly sees him as a player who knows only one play. Cal is not a quick study. Carell who specializes in 40-year-old virgins and other slow-on-the-uptake regular guys plays him with equal parts sexual humiliation and Everyman honor. He scores with one woman (an initially funny Marisa Tomei fizzy as a pop bottle shaken briskly before opening) but still carries the torch for his wife Emily (Moore who did the part of straying spouse with so much more verve in The Kids Are All Right). Co-directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (who made the under-known I Love You Phillip Morris and cowrote the scabrous Bad Santa) have sympathy for all their characters always a plus in comedy. Yet theres so little zip in the Carell-Moore scenes that it imbalances this intricately plotted comic apparatus. Stone and Gosling - now theres one sexy couple more remarkable for the fact that there is nothing explicit in the film. The way they hold the screen - and each other - is the stuff movie dreams are made of. They bite into their parts with such gusto that everyone else - except Tomei and Tipton - looks toothless. But in the end Ficarra and Requa take all the formula ingredients and blend them into a satisfying - and tasty - concoction. A Midsummer Nights Sex Comedy meet Alls Well That Ends Well.

Pictures Ben Glass) Crazy Stupid Love Talented cast of Crazy Stupid Love cant overcome confused story BY JOE WILLIAMS  Post-Dispatch Film Critic  joewilliamspost-dispatch.com  314-340-8344 Jul 28 2011 (...) Ben Glass In this film publicity image released by Warner Bros. Pictures Ryan Gosling left and Emma Stone are shown in a scene from ""Crazy Stupid Love."" (AP Photo/Warner Bros. Pictures Ben Glass) The most common line of dialogue in American movies is ""Lets get out of here."" Usually it signals a strategic retreat but in the romantic comedy ""Crazy Stupid Love"" its the deadly effective mating call of a preening peacock named Jacob (Ryan Gosling).Jacob rules the roost at the trendy singles bar where a divorcing dad named Carl (Steve Carell) has come to drown his sorrows. Carl has just discovered that his wife (Julianne Moore) is having an affair with a co-worker (Kevin Bacon) and now the suburban schlub is crying in his Cosmo. So Jacob takes Carl under his wing teaching him to dress and flirt like a liberated man.If ""Crazy Stupid Love"" were a makeover movie it would be a particularly crass one as it celebrates name-brand consumption and one-night-stands where no names are necessary. But the confused story by cartoon scribe Dan Fogelman (""Cars 2"") hedges its bets by splitting the focus into fuzzy thirds. While Carl is learning to swing Jacob is learning to express his true feelings to young lawyer Hanna (Emma Stone). And Carls son Robbie (Jonah Bobo) is experiencing his first crush on baby-sitter Jessica (Analeigh Tipton) -- who has the hots for Carl. The talented cast which also includes Marisa Tomei as Carls reward for barroom honesty encourages us to view this many-sided roundelay of love from a wise overhead perspective. But directors John Requa and Glenn Ficarra were weaned on earthy comedies like ""Bad Santa"" and every moment of mature insight in ""Crazy Stupid Love"" is answered by a scene of formulaic farce. The last act which includes some birdbrained slapstick and inappropriately public squawks about true love is enough to make an owlish adult say ""Lets get out of here.""

"Crazy Stupid Love movie review by Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Carell and Moores rom-com has a Crazy Stupid setupCrazy Stupid Love -- 2 starsJuly 28 2011|Michael Phillips | Movie criticRyan Gosling in ""Crazy Stupid Love.""In the aggravatingly punctuated romantic comedy ""Crazy Stupid Love."" (can you even believe that period?) does anyone ever discuss why the central couple played by Steve Carell and Julianne Moore should or shouldnt be together? Or the romantic challenges that face two people who met in high school when they were pre-adults and settled down when their friends were still wound up over their latest romances? No they dont. They do not talk about such matters. Too bad because theyre interesting. What we have here is an unstable if fairly diverting case of 21st century characters caught in a 19th century Feydeau-style plot machine featuring an ensemble doing all it can to finesse the swings between melancholic pathos and ""Meet the Fockers""-level slapstick. This is the ""Babel"" or ""Crash"" of ensemble romantic comedies with screenwriter Dan Fogelman mapping out several narrative surprises that throw you for little loops as theyre delivered. After a couple of decades of marriage the LA wife and mother of two played by Moore announces over dinner that she wants a divorce owing to an affair with a co-worker (Kevin Bacon Hollywoods preferred cad-about-town). Her husband played by top-billed Carell can barely process the news. He moves out though finds himself sneaking back over to the house at night to tend to the yardwork in secret. Much of ""Crazy Stupid Love."" takes place in a pickup bar frequented by the abbed-up ladyslayer played by Ryan Gosling who always seems more wax than human to me though there may be some straight females and gay males out there who have a different opinion. Out of pity and arrogance plus a smidge of affection this self-described ""total tomcat in the sack"" presents himself as a sort of manhood recovery consultant coaching the Carell character newly on the market into finding his hot new persona. Goslings poor-little-rich-stud comes from a loveless home and a mother described as ""cold."" This he reveals uncharacteristically to his latest conquest a lawyer-in-training played by Emma Stone who captures his heart and turns the tables. Following templates laid out by ""Love Actually"" among others ""Crazy Stupid Love."" throws adversities of the heart at everyone. The central couples older kid (Jonah Bobo) instructs dad to ""just go get her back"" (mom that is) so theres never a question about how things will end. The boy is introduced as hes fantasizing about his 17-year-old baby sitter (Analeigh Tipton a cast standout) whos in turn obsessed with the Carell character and who photographs herself naked for her unwitting crushs benefit though the photographs are discovered by her parents. Complication complication and more complication. The Moore character derives little pleasure or satisfaction from her short-lived fling; Carells character goes on a sexual tear -- Marisa Tomei does what she can in the role of diversion numero uno -- but never loses sight of the love of his life. (This doesnt quite seem fair.) Directed by the ""I Love You Phillip Morris"" team of Glenn Ficarra and John Requa ""C S L."" connects its characters in unexpected ways. But line to line the script lacks wit and sophistication. I realize that many moviegoers take a chance on the R-rated ""Bridesmaids"" or ""Horrible Bosses"" and end up feeling mugged by the coarseness of the humor. ""C S L."" which manages to stay this side of R may not traffic in gross-out jokes. But the script treats the adults like children while pulling the old shtick about putting the real wisdom in the mouths of its teenagers. Also the look of the movie is about as greasy as the Gosling character; between this film and the much snappier ""Friends With Benefits"" audiences are getting a dubious tutorial this summer on how to shoot a comedy whether digitally or on film. Still Keep an eye on Tipton. Theres more going on with her face a kaleidoscope of determination doubt and confusion than with the movie itself. mjphillipstribune.com Crazy Stupid Love -- 2 stars MPAA rating PG-13 (for coarse humor sexual content and language) Cast Steve Carell (Cal); Ryan Gosling (Jacob); Julianne Moore (Emily); Emma Stone (Hannah); Jonah Bobo (Robbie); John Carroll Lynch (Bernie); Analeigh Tipton (Jessica); Kevin Bacon (David); Marisa Tomei (Kate) Credits Directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa; written by Dan Fogelman; produced by Steve Carell and Denise Di Novi.

Unfortunately ""Crazy Stupid Love"" veers schizophrenically between daring jaw-dropping comedy and gooey sitcom cliches that weigh it down like Hefs saggy old ... well you know. The Hefner line is uttered by Ryan Gosling as Jacob a cool womanizer who becomes the lady-hunting mentor of dumped dorky Cal Weaver (Steve Carell) after Cals wife Emily (Julianne Moore) cheats on him with a co-worker. For Cal this betrayal hits particularly hard since he and Emily were high-school sweethearts and shes the only woman with whom hes ever been intimate. The bereft Cal starts spending his evenings bemoaning his fate over vodka-cranberries at the same L.A. watering hole where Jacob practices his smooth line of patter on a series of willing young lovelies. The young stud gets so fed up with the middle-aged Eeyores wailing that he makes over everything from Cals patter to his skin care. (""Are you in a fraternity? Are you Steve Jobs the billionaire CEO of Apple? No? Then you have no reason to wear New Balance shoes. Ever"") Naturally just as Cal learns to put some rico in his suave Jacob meets Hannah (Emma Stone) seemingly the one woman on earth who doesnt fall for his line. She quotes the old Lauren Bacall TV ads for High Point coffee and displays slack-jawed amazement over Jacobs ""photoshopped""-looking abs; he reveals that his ""big move"" comes from a seminal chick flick. Thus Jacob and Hannahs sex-free night together winds up being the peak of ""Crazy Stupid Love"" since everything after that gets bogged down in zany impossible plot twists (which OK I didnt see coming because I was hoping for something less like a PG-13 episode of ""Full House""). The tug of war between the movies smart trouble-making side (which includes Marisa Tomeis hot-thing walk-on as Cals first conquest) and its ultimate capitulation to the warm and fuzzy can be traced directly to the credits. Directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa are the guys behind darkly hilarious rule-breakers like ""Bad Santa"" and ""I Love You Phillip Morris"" while writer Dan Fogelman is the guy who wrote ""Cars"" ""Bolt"" and ""Fred Claus."" Unfortunately for us its Fogelmans sensibility that emerges triumphant. Still theres a talented cast frequently pushed outside of their comfort zone. Gosling is without a doubt a talented actor and the movie wisely takes the sour-faced self-satisfaction that can sometimes creep into his roles and turns it into Jacobs character flaw making him equally believable as a shallow snake and as a guy desperate to leave the search for Ms. Goodbar behind him. Stone of course can do intelligent ingenue in her sleep by now but she and Gosling generate enough sparks that you want to see them re-teamed in a better-written movie -- that long-threatened ""Thin Man"" remake maybe? As for Carell in films like ""Dan in Real Life"" he has taken the lovable loser bit a few steps too far figuratively dragging a string section behind him to get an ""aww"" out of the audience. Here he dials it back making Cals more pathetic features part of the joke. (After a fight with Emily Cal is left standing alone in a parking lot and it suddenly begins to rain. And just as youre thinking it Cal says aloud ""What a cliche."") Julianne Moore alas doesnt get the comedic full-tilt-boogie opportunities she was afforded in last years ""The Kids Are All Right"" but her performance is pretty much the only facet of ""Crazy Stupid Love"" that makes us care about whether or not Cal and Emily can fix their marriage. The film gets such a naughty lift out of Cal shedding his tucked-in polo shirts and pleated Dockers that were in no hurry to see him return to suburban bliss. ""Crazy Stupid Love"" seems destined to become an audience favorite on cable since repeat viewers will know the parts they want to see over and over again -- and theyll also know when to change channels before things get too drippy. Moviegoers wont have that option but thats what snack-runs are for. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Comments click to enlarge Crazy Stupid Love. Video Rated PG-13  118 minutes  2011 Glenn Ficarra and John Requa who wrote Bad Santa and directed I Love You Phillip Morris betray their trademark discomforting humor with this big-screen sitcom in which a nerdy accountant (Steve Carell) gets dating advice from a slick womanizer (Ryan Gosling enjoying a role that might once have gone to Peter Lawford). As in the directors earlier work the humor is rooted in humiliation but the execution here is tepid and indecisive possibly because the big-name stars need to seem charming no matter how loathsome or idiotic their behavior. The episodic plot encompasses a series of familiar gags about casual sex and finding your soul mate few of them delivered with much enthusiasm. With Emma Stone and Julianne Moore.

More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Steve Carell his Office duties behind him is wonderfully appealing and vulnerable as Cal Weaver whod be a 40-year-old virgin if he didnt marry the first and only woman hes ever had sex with. Thats Emily (the reliably superb Julianne Moore) and shes tired of Cal taking her and their kids for granted. So tired that she sleeps with co-worker David Lindhagen (Kevin Bacon) and kicks Cal to the curb. Ryan Gosling scores a comic knockout as Jacob Palmer a notorious player who takes it on himself to make over uncool Cal and get him laid. Carell makes his transformation amusing and believable. And his sparring with Gosling spins the movie into a riotous game of relationship poker. Jacob falls for hard-to-get Hannah (a scintillating Emma Stone). Cal who wants his wife back doesnt see that teen babysitter Jessica (a star-is-born turn from Analeigh Tipton) has the hots for him or that Robbie (Jonah Bobo) his 13-year-old son has the hots for Jessica. Things come to a head after Cals one-nighter with Kate (Marisa Tomei) whos actually Robbies teacher. Ouch What makes Crazy Stupid Love a cut above is actors who let pain seep into the laughs. Heres a comedy you really can take to heart.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The stakes are so high for Hollywood movies of any kind especially in the summer that every film has to be an event even one thats driven largely by character and performance. And when the characters and performances are particularly well-conceived it has the effect of exposing the dumb artificiality of the big setpieces all the more. For most of the way Crazy Stupid Love coasts more than agreeably on the talents of four hugely charismatic actors and a tart knowing script that tweaks the rom-com formula just enough to seem fresh. Yet the two crowd-pleasing payoffs--one that draws everyone together in calamitous farce the other the sort of embarrassing/sappy speech that only happens in Hollywood--have a distancing effect. These characters deserve a follow-through as real and human as they are. The many gears of Dan Fogelmans script are set into motion when Julianne Moore enduring another routine dinner date with her husband Steve Carell announces that she wants a divorce after 25 years of marriage. And whats more she slept with an unctuous co-worker played by Kevin Bacon. Reeling from the news Carell shuffles off to a cruddy apartment and drowns his sorrows in watered-down vodka-cranberries at an upscale singles bar. Ryan Gosling stars as the bars resident lothario a damnable charmer who takes pity on Carell and vows to be his ""Mr. Miyagi"" in the pick-up game. Of course bedding a new woman every night is apparently no way to live so Gosling gets a love interest of his own in Emma Stone a bright young lawyer-to-be who sees through his routine but has trouble resisting it. Crazy Stupid Love adds on some other complications too including a vaguely creepy subplot about an underage babysitters infatuation with Carell all united in themes of misunderstanding and pursuing ones true soulmate. Though it echoes The 40-Year-Old Virgin too closely--here Carell isnt a virgin but hes only slept with one person--the interplay between Carell and Gosling generates most of the comedy as the young stud turns his pupil into a metrosexual one layer at a time. Gosling and Stone too have wonderful chemistry; their all-night ""seduction"" sequence is the films highlight witty and effortlessly sexy. Its a shame this kind of unforced intimacy and wit doesnt always carry over but its enough.

"Crazy Stupid Love Not quite there - USATODAY.com Skip to Main Content USA TODAY Subscribe Mobile Home News Travel Money Sports Life Your Life Tech Weather Crazy Stupid Love Not quite there By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Updated Comments Reprints amp; Permissions Sometimes Crazy Stupid Love captures the complexity humor and sweetness of relationships. By Ben Glass Warner Bros. Pictures Steve Carell and Julianne Moore navigate the treacherous waters of matrimony in Crazy Stupid Love. EnlargeClose By Ben Glass Warner Bros. Pictures Steve Carell and Julianne Moore navigate the treacherous waters of matrimony in Crazy Stupid Love. But in several scenes the film takes that insight and replaces it with farcical coincidences and strained scenarios that undercut the poignancy and wit. PHOTOS Carells career STORY The comedian talks romance new film Steve Carell plays Cal a contented husband and father unaware of the discontent that has overtaken Emily (Julianne Moore) the woman he has loved since high school. Cal goes from soul mate to cuckold in the course of one dinner out with his wife of 25 years. From there the film tries for irreverence but it more often falls into calculated cutesiness. Its not the fault of the top-notch ensemble of actors which includes Carell and Ryan Gosling who have a winning chemistry. Most surprising is Gosling who reveals a knack for comedy. Carell has proven he can play dramatic parts (Little Miss Sunshine) and his soulful performance here blends comedy and pathos. Gosling plays Jacob a lady-killer who decides to make Cal his project when he spots him in sad-sack mode at a bar. ""I dont know if I should help you or euthanize you"" Jacob says after he hears Cal telling anyone who will listen how he was cuckolded. Crazy Stupid Love   1/2 out of four Stars Steve Carell Julianne Moore Ryan Gosling Emma Stone Marisa Tomei Director Glenn Ficarra John Requa DistributorWarner Bros. Rating PG-13 for coarse humor sexual content and language Running time 1 hour 58 minutes Opens Friday nationwide Jacob oversees Cals extreme makeover and shows him how to hit on women. But Jacobs Lothario shtick is shaken when he meets Hannah (Emma Stone) who scoffs at his cheesy come-ons. Marisa Tomei has a thankless role as Cals first conquest. Their connection goes from awkwardly flirty to ridiculously over the top. Moore one of the best actresses of her generation is saddled with an underdeveloped part. The source of her marital dissatisfaction is unclear. But there is a moving scene in which she and Cal talk on the phone about a household matter that she invented as an excuse to call him. With their faces filled with yearning and voices thick with emotion its Carell and Moores best scene together. In a subplot that should have been jettisoned their 13-year-old son Robbie (Jonah Bobo) is head-over-heels for his 17-year-old babysitter Jessica (Analeigh Tipton). He waxes poetic and makes outlandishly grand gestures to win her over. Even worse Robbie makes a speech about doomed love at his middle-school graduation prompting Cal to leap up and hijack the ceremony to declare his own devotion for his estranged wife. Oddly no one in the audience has a problem with that. Also cringe-inducing is Jessicas far-fetched infatuation with the nebbishy 45-year-old Cal. Theres so much wrong with this scenario its hard to know where to begin. Hampered by contrivances and the awkward melding of romantic comedy and family drama the film falters. Theres even a ridiculous brawl at its climax. Crazy Stupid Love is at its wisest when focusing on the inexplicable -- but recognizable -- craziness of love.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr (Ben Glass) A Crazy Stupid Love. Genre Drama Romantic Comedy Romance Comedy; Starring Steve Carell Ryan Gosling Julianne Moore Emma Stone; Director Glenn Ficarra John Requa; Author Dan Fogelman; Release Date Wide 07/29/2011; Runtime (in minutes) 117; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted August 4 2011 -- 1200 AM EDT For an actor who tends to wrap his lines in tightly clipped irony and who from certain angles resembles Rowan Atkinsons handsome brother Steve Carell has an unexpectedly sincere gift for playing men who have just had the hope pulled right out from under them. In the opening scene of Crazy Stupid Love Cal Weaver (Carell) a fairly typical nice-guy suburbanite dressed in rumpled Dockers and worn sneakers learns that his wife Emily (Julianne Moore) has been having an affair and plans to divorce him. There was a period long ago when films like Kramer vs. Kramer (1979) dealt head-on with the agony of busted marriage and though Crazy Stupid Love is nothing more (or less) than an enchanting light comedy of romantic confusion it has the bone-deep sadness that drove those films. Its a movie that understands love because it understands pain. Cal starts to hang out at an elegant local pickup bar where after too many vodka cranberries he launches into sloshed monologues of self-pity that are noisy enough to win the attention of Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling) a lothario in frosty blond hair and three-piece suits. Out of some mixture of compassion and disgust (he cant believe how pathetic Cal is) Jacob decides to give this fortysomething loser a crash course in how to be a single guy again which sounds like a very movie-ish situation and is -- the same one in fact that powered Will Smiths Hitch. But Crazy Stupid Love even when it takes off from a setup like this one has a gentle observational shrewdness -- and an eye for detail -- that makes it a terrifically amusing study in contemporary behavior. Carell gives a ruefully funny and lived-in performance as the once-cozy husband and father of three who has lost any vestige of his alpha-male instinct. When Gosling as the bar stud Henry Higgins takes Carell for a makeover (his look and his personality) he does it with a dry contempt that is drolly cutting. Cal becomes an avid student in the rather depressing art of treating sexual banter as a manipulative science. It begins to work for him but thats only the films first act. The movie is also about Cal and Emilys floppy-haired 13-year-old son Robbie (Jonah Bobo) who has a frighteningly intense crush on the family babysitter (Analeigh Tipton) who has a secret crush of her own. Its about Hannah (Emma Stone) a law student trying to run her romantic life in as controlled a fashion as her career and what happens when she meets Jacob. Its about Emilys relationship with the cocky accountant (Kevin Bacon) who broke up her marriage Cals fling with a flighty teacher (Marisa Tomei) and the feelings Cal and Emily still have for each other. Crazy Stupid Love was written by Dan Fogelman (who has coscripted animated films like Cars and Bolt as well as Fred Claus) and directed by the team of Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (I Love You Phillip Morris) and Im happy to report that they have made the single best mainstream movie for adults this summer. Tart and ? funny sweetly melancholy and rooted in experience Crazy Stupid Love is like a movie made by the Woody Allen of Hannah and Her Sisters if only hed hailed from the suburbs. The picture is full of moments to savor whether its Jacob telling the schlubby Cal to ""be better than the Gap"" or Cal and Emily reuniting for a parent-teacher conference (the scene all but vibrates with the years theyve shared together) or Hannah and Jacobs touching postcoital murmurings or the Big Romantic Speech at the end -- a conventional moment to be sure except that the hard-won battle-weary affection of Cals words left me in tears. One of the movies motifs is Cals decades-old line about Emily ""Shes the perfect combination of sexy and cute."" Crazy Stupid Love is the perfect combination of sexy cute wise hilarious and true.

Crazy Stupid Love  1/2 Directors Glenn Ficarra John Requa. Cast Steve Carell Ryan Gosling Julianne Moore. Rating PG-13 for coarse humor sexual content and language. Great Good Fair Bad Bomb Its a romantic comedy with the requisite ludicrous situations and unlikely coincidences including one that arrives a little past the halfway point that is a jaw-dropper. It has unpleasant little asides that pop up here and there along the way. And in at least one point of the film - this is a romantic comedy remember - every single major character is resolutely miserable. I liked it. Steve Carell talks Crazy Stupid Love Interview Emma Stone Part of that has to do with the confidence with which Glenn Ficarra and John Requa direct the film soldiering on through anything that might play as false treating the absurd and the (relatively) profound with equal gravity. But more than that are the actors theyve assembled - a good bunch its a pleasure to spend time with. Steve Carell plays Cal a boring businessman who is informed by his wife Emily (Julianne Moore) over a dinner date that she wants a divorce. Whats more she slept with a guy (Kevin Bacon) at her office. So theres that. Meanwhile Cal and Emilys son Robbie (Jonah Bobo) believes in the idea of soul mates and thinks he has found his in his babysitter Jessica (Analeigh Tipton). Hes 13 and shes 17 but that doesnt dissuade him. Jessica on the other hand has fallen for Cal. Its a regular Peyton Place Were not done yet. Despondent lost Cal wanders into a swank bar and observes pick-up artist Jacob (Ryan Gosling) at work. And for whatever reason Jacob observes Cal as well. Taking pity he takes Cal on as a kind of project getting him clothes that fit a better haircut and a sort of Steve-Carell version of a no-woman-turns-me-down attitude. Jacob after all never strikes out - except with Hannah (Emma Stone) a law student who laughs off his come-ons. Until one night when she doesnt. Circumstances conspire for him to finally bring her home; their self-aware take on a mating ritual is a hoot and better still surprising. Naturally he falls for her. Jacobs lessons pay off for Cal at least in the short term. Hes only loved one woman in his life - Emily - and his sneaking into his old yard to do her lawn work late at night shows that hasnt changed despite all thats gone on. But Dan Fogelmans screenplay doesnt go the sappy route. Cal has some success with other women if you define success in Jacobs terms most notably with Kate (Marisa Tomei unhinged and funny in a tiny role). No particular good can come of any of this of course and things come to a head in Cal and Emilys backyard in a scene with developments both unlikely and entertaining. Too much weirdness has gone on for a typically happy romantic-comedy ending and its to Ficarra and Requas credit that they tie up . . . almost nothing. Carell is his dependable wounded-puppy self always likable but Gosling and Stone are fantastic. Jacobs self-confidence belies an underlying unhappiness and Gosling makes both elements believable - plus his comic timing is right on. So is Stones. She is becoming a dependable go-to choice for comedies brimming with charisma. Bobo and Tipton are also charming in roles that could have been borderline creepy but arent. Theyre better than they should be - an apt description of ""Crazy Stupid Love"" itself. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

No Yes and Absolutely Not. The latest Steve Carell midlife crisis vehicle stalls after the first scene. By Rex Reed  07/26/11 723pm Gosling and Carell. What to say about an uphill slog called Crazy Stupid Love? Its not nearly crazy enough to clear the clogged arteries of summer comedies and when the love appears its in all the wrong places. Oh well at least they nailed the stupid part. This movie is so hapless that not even two directors could get it right. Guided with a sledgehammer by the team of Glenn Ficarra and John Requa and written with a No. 2 soft-lead kindergarten pencil by Dan Fogelman this snore stars a number of  talented people who should have known better. After 25 years of marriage square suburban doofus Cal (Steve Carell who invents these roles as vehicles and produced this one to prove it) is devastated to learn that his wife Emily (Julianne Moore) is committing adultery with her boss (Kevin Bacon) and filing  for divorce. Their creepy 13-year-old son is in love with his 17-year-old babysitter but shes in love with Cal who doesnt know it. Drowning in self-pity Cal lands in dating hell hanging out at a local bar for the depressed and displaced sipping vodka and cranberry with a straw. A supercilious stranger and self-anointed King of the Babe Magnets named Jacob (a dismally miscast Ryan Gosling) says ""I dont know whether I should help you or euthanize you"" but takes on the task of helping Cal get his mojo back while sticking him with a bar bill for 837. This is the kind of movie in which real men drink scotch instead of Cosmos and wear suede instead of Ralph Lauren. After all the counseling and all the hours at the gym and the new wardrobe the woman Cal chooses to try out his new sex appeal is Marisa Tomei who turns out to be his sons eighth grade English teacher. Meanwhile Jacob who is supposed to be all man (but with a weakness for buying things on the Home Shopping Network) blows his own cover when he meets a girl he calls a ""game changer"" played by Flavor of the Month Emma Stone. Its the first time hes ever taken a woman to bed and talked himself to sleep. Of course the ""game changer"" turns out to be the movies only big surprise. Id be a cad to reveal her identity before you have a chance to head for the doors marked ""Exit."" From here this thumping snooze rattles and woofs its way into a crazy quilt of mistaken  identity with almost the  entire cast punching it out in a massive donnybrook in Cals back yard where he sometimes shows up in the middle of the  night to water his  old rose bushes. Before it all ends at a junior-high graduation that has to be seen to be believed they all grow up learn to be  better people and discover the true meaning of love in  a finale that can only be described as utterly preposterous. None of this is much fun to watch. The pace drags. The acting is without contrast or color. Farce is not Ryan Goslings style; he looks like hes coming down with something contagious. Steve Carell plays this kind of nerdy squarely dressed aging dweeb in his sleep. He has a patent on the role but hasnt got a clue about how to make it look anything more than ossified. Crazy Stupid Love is an alleged comedy comprising currents of disconnected irony. For it to work those threads should meet in some believable fashion. Instead they unravel faster than the drawstring on a pair of 32-inch gym shorts worn by a man with a 42-inch waistline. rreedobserver.com CRAZY STUPID LOVE Running time 117 minutes Written by Dan Fogelman Directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa Starring Steve Carell Ryan Gosling Julianne Moore 1/4 Comment Filed under Affairs cheating dan fogelman glenn ficarra john requa Julianne Moore love Midlife Crisis movie movie reviews News amp; Politics Ryan Gosling Sex Steve Carell Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture No Alarms No Surprises Why Buying Concert Tickets Is a Rigged System Culture Milo Yiannopoulos Does Not Deserve Twitter Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP",http://www.observer.com/2011/07/crazy-stupid-love-no-yes-and-absolutely-not/,200,crazystupidlove.28,crazystupidlove.,observer

She goes on to mention that she had an affair with a co-worker named Dave Lindhagen (Kevin Bacon) at which point Cal tells her that hes heard enough. (Hes not kidding By the time Cal makes it to the bar that night the name ""Dave Lindhagen"" will have become a kind of negative mantra for him.) But Emily cant stop talking. ""I think Im having a midlife crisis"" she confesses a couple of scenes later when the now-estranged couple meet again. ""Can women even have midlife crises? In the movies its always men.""And in this movie too. Would that an actress of Julianne Moores age and talent got a chance to explore an identity crisis in a real way in a venue other than Showtime but whatever Emily may be going through its swiftly pushed to the background. Following Friends With Benefits as the second romantic comedy in as many weeks to ostentatiously point up its awareness of romantic-comedy cliche several times over the course of a narrative that ultimately validates far more of those cliches than it deflates here Crazy Stupid Love makes the mistake of suggesting a path untrod by films of its genre only to deliver a scramble of the romantic-comedic familiar. Directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa were last seen as the auteurs of I Love You Phillip Morris one of the smartest comedies of recent years and quite possibly the best gay relationship film ever made featuring Hollywood stars. Crazy Stupid Love isnt nearly as groundbreaking but its love-positive dramedy is notably bighearted and enlivened by the work of a few good actors.So Moore recedes popping up mostly as a foil to Cals effort to Regain His Manhood via new clothes and anonymous sex. He takes tutoring in both fields from Jacob (Ryan Gosling) a hard-bodied harder-hearted player who is moved to Change His Ways when he falls for Hannah (Emma Stone) a stunning lady neurotic/law student whose Focus on Career has left her in lack of a satisfying romantic life. In a less successfully integrated story thread Cals 13-year-old son nurses an obsessive crush on his 17-year-old babysitter who in turn only has eyes for 40-something Cal--a roundelay whose bawdy sentimentality feels airlifted from a John Hughes movie.Carell and Gosling each willing to take his character to the point of caricature in order to find the truth in him have a nicely barbed chemistry together never more convincing than in the scene indicative of Crazys treatment of cinematic tropes in which they establish their pupil-mentor relationship. Strangers negotiating in a bar they use gangster-film lingo (""Maybe you remind me of somebody"" ""You in or you out?"") to cement a bond whose first destination is necessarily a shopping montage.Carells film choices as far back as The 40 Year-Old Virgin suggest a tendency toward middle-aged every-nerd romantic leads--the unlikely love interest who spends an entire film proving his charms--but here hes given a realistically complicated person to play. As Goslings character puts it Cal has ""kind eyes and a good head of hair"" both of which go a long way toward boosting the credibility of a character who bounces between oblivious dad hopeless romantic and calculating lothario. In contrast to Carells contrived ""transformation"" into romantic hero Gosling is treated like an ingenue with the directors building an entire scene around the awesome spectacle of his rock-hard midsection giving his ass and hulking muscles their own key light in a sex scene in which his partner is mostly in shadow.Dan Fogelmans script is snappy if too proudly referential (its hard to say if a motif involving the use of Dirty Dancing as a seduction tool was outright stolen from last years French rom-com Heartbreaker or if the similarity is mere coincidence). The film is more interesting at its least cute; in its second half the dialogue seems looser less bound to punchline. Characters who previously talked over one another too deep in their own heads to actually have an exchange slow down and start to listen. Shooting on grainy high-speed film stock with an often handheld camera working with a suite of actors who are game to both play light and silly and dig deep Ficarra and Requa lend a naturalism to highly contrived patently absurd situations.Spoiler alert There are two plot twists neither of which seem particularly necessary but I have to admit that I saw neither coming. Thats the thing about movie cliches--as eager as filmmakers seem to be to show that they know the jig is up sometimes that shit just works.

Is Inspired But Suffers From a Very Specific Hollywood Problem REVIEW | ""Crazy Stupid Love."" Is Inspired But Suffers From a Very Specific Hollywood Problem Eric Kohn Jul 26 2011 219 am erickohn Share This Article Pin It Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Print Talk Years after gaining fame for writing the modern subversive holiday classic ""Bad Santa"" Hollywood has finally made room for John Requa and Glenn Ficarra. Having directed the wry gay comedy ""I Love You Phillip Morris"" last year Requa and Ficarra have brought their unique combination of gleeful vulgarity classic wit and perceptive characters to the studio system. Unsurprisingly that arrival comes with some compromises. ""Crazy Stupid Love."" (period intended) unquestionably stands above the market standard for middlebrow comedies but it repeatedly approaches greatness and stands down beholden to forces quite possibly beyond the directors control. Although Requa and Ficarra have no writing credit this time out (the screenplay was penned by ""Cars"" writer Dan Fogelman marking his first foray into live action) the material is certainly familiar from their earlier outings. Just as ""Bad Santa"" and ""Phillip Morris"" dismantled conventional notions of suburban domesticity with a ribald sense of play ""Crazy Stupid Love."" involves a presumably stable family coming apart at the seams. From there it spins outward with over a half dozen central characters whose mini-stories weave together and break apart with each developing arc serving a theme about the art of romantic attraction as neat as the period at the end of the movies title. Its easy to see what attracted Requa and Ficarra to Fogelmans script. Although ostensibly about sex ""Crazy Stupid Love."" never indulges in sophomoric gags. The humor when it creeps into the frame has a resolutely adult edge. From the first scene when Cal (Steve Carell) sits blank-faced across the table from his despondent wife (Julianne Moore) moments after she expresses a need to get divorced its clear that the directors feel no mounting urge to reach for the first available punchline. Carells blank expression in response to his wifes blunt pronouncement speaks volumes about the movies deadpan appeal. Unlike the playfulness of ""Phillip Morris"" this is a classy work that blends innuendo with bittersweet character types each of whom maintains a strong believable definition. Carrell finds the best outlet for his blue collar pathos since ""Dan in Real Life."" Ryan Gosling-as the smooth hustler who takes Cal under his wing and teaches him how to nab single women at the neighborhood bar-brings a welcome element of generosity to a typically slimy one-dimensional archetype. The younger cast members get a chance to show off previously unseen talents. Analeigh Tipton as the babysitter for Cals feisty adolescent son (Jonah Bobo) develops a hilarious crush on Cal with the precise balance of sexual curiosity and shoe-gazing sincerity that makes her a reasonable pick for the cast of Whit Stillmans upcoming feature ""Damsels in Distress."" Bobo meanwhile gets the rare child role that lets him mouth off and clearly relishes the opportunity. Emma Stone usually the object of desire in broader comedic outings like ""Superbad"" and ""Easy A"" plays a romantically troubled law student whose attraction to Goslings character put her prude nature to the test (and becomes the single ingredient seemingly disconnected to the rest of the plot a tricky maneuver that only shows its full definition near the end). These faces both familiar and new make ""Crazy Stupid Love."" entirely engaging and heartfelt while also allowing it to touch on multiple points of view from various stages of life. The free-wheeling structure moves forward with purpose but lacks focus. The odd thing about the scripts darkly comic appeal is that it has a curiously dull edge that teeters on the edge of one comically deranged situation after another before repeatedly playing the safe card. Theres an institutional tension here between giving the audience what it wants and what it least expects What once would have been considered transgressive now looks like a lot of cable television-flashes of innovation amid routine structures. This makes ""Crazy Stupid Love."" alternately liberating and mundane. A ludicrous climactic twist brings the entire ensemble into one spot with just enough chaotic inspiration to inject new life into the material. But then the movie regrettably continues for several more scenes tidying up for an unremarkable ending when it worked better all over the place. This is the kind of uneven product that emerges when filmmakers whose sensibilities exist outside of commercial norms try to work within the system. (Consider as well David Gordon Greens awkward transition to directing outlandish studio comedies ""Your Highness"" was an attempt to make a crude R-rated comedy like nothing else out there but it was essentially a lark.) However while ""Crazy Stupid Love."" falters it challenges convention enough to make the experience worthwhile Marisa Tomei as the middle school instructor Cal beds to get over his divorce repeatedly shouts ""asshole"" to his face during a parent-teacher conference possibly one-upping the infamous Jennifer Aniston ""pussy"" scene in ""Horrible Bosses."" Later when Gosling and Stone go home together and decide theyre less interested in a one-night stand than getting to know each other they relish the opportunity for an actors showcase. For a brief moment Hollywood gets real and even meta ""I am R-rated sexy"" Stone tells Gosling ""and I know what happens in the PG-13 version."" Maybe the MPAA was playing a cruel joke by giving ""Crazy Stupid Love."" exactly that rating but even more likely its exactly what the studio wanted. At any rate many audiences can relate to Stones prediction and ""Crazy Stupid Love."" lazily confirms it. criticWIRE grade B- HOW WILL IT PLAY? Marketed as an adult romantic comedy with a cast of popular stars ""Crazy Stupid Love."" could do solid business as summer counter-programming during its first weekend. But reviews will be mixed and some of the bigger blockbuster fare will likely bury its long-term prospects. It opens nationwide on Friday.

By David Denby Couple trouble Ryan Gosling Emma Stone Steve Carell and Julianne Moore.   Credit Illustration by ROBERT RISKO For the current Vanity Fair cover the young actress Emma Stone has been outfitted as an overgrown Lolita--bikini blond hair flaming-red lips. But in ""Crazy Stupid Love"" a genial messy comedy of marital discord and mismatched lovers Stone has auburn hair and a slightly downturned mouth; she looks like a woman and she has a direct clearheaded way about her that suggests the confidence of a potential star. Shes the strongest thing in the movie though she isnt part of the main line of the story which is also the least interesting. It seems that after twenty-five years the marriage of Cal (Steve Carell) and Emily (Julianne Moore) is breaking up. Emily has been sleeping with a dull guy in her office (Kevin Bacon in an unwritten part) and Cal hearing this news from Emily as she drives them through Los Angeles (the movies geography is a little vague) opens the car door and drops to the street like a misplaced bag of groceries. That Im afraid is the highlight of Cal and Emilys scenes together. Cal distraught airs his troubles in a sleek bar with amber glass walls and white stonework and a lot of lacquered players--a sort of can-I-buy-you-a-drink store for the always available. Jacob (Ryan Gosling) the king of the bar a mover in Simon Spurr Gossuin and designer stubble takes pity on the cuckold and teaches him how to pick up women. The kings own personal closer is ""Lets get out of here"" a line that unaccountably seems to work with every woman in the place except one Hannah (Stone) a law-school graduate who nimbly dismisses him. At least at first. She changes her mind though and arriving at his wraparound-glass bachelor pad demands that he remove his shirt which he does revealing a chest and abs so perfectly sculpted that shes revolted. She says ""Seriously? Its like youre Photoshopped"" Men in the audience may be relieved to hear that at least some women find the perfection of a gym body too close to narcissism to be a turn-on and Stone gives the line and many others a quick precise tart delivery. ""Crazy Stupid Love"" which was directed by the team of Glenn Ficarra and John Requa mixes a comedy-of-remarriage plot with a midsummer-nights serial follies. Cal loves his wife; Jacob is fascinated by Hannah; Cals thirteen-year-old son Robbie (Jonah Bobo) loves the teen-ager Jessica (Analeigh Tipton) who babysits for Robbies little sister; and Jessica loves of all people Cal. Written by Dan Fogelman the script has many parts in motion and a fair amount of it works delicately and well. Young Robbie boldly and persistently declares himself to Jessica (he doesnt know that hes not even in uniform much less out of his league) and Analeigh Tipton a tall slender stalk with huge pouty lips receives his declarations so sweetly that the scenes dont humiliate the actors or us. Robbies quest is the overstrained hope of adolescence. The subsidiary plotlines are touching and often funny but Cal and Emily provide the frame for all the goings on (there are a lot more). And who really cares if these nice ordinary people remain separated or get back together? They met when they were in high school and apart from reminiscing about that time they dont have much to say to each other. In the remarriage classics (""The Awful Truth"" ""The Philadelphia Story"" ""His Girl Friday"") the former partners have a way of talking and being with each other that they dont have--and couldnt possibly have--with anyone else. That sophisticated metaphor for sexual compatibility made for uniquely satisfying romantic comedy. But ""Crazy Stupid Love"" holds to the boring modern convention that good people are inarticulate and Cal and Emily mainly stumble around trying to fill the silence. Julianne Moore may be too earnest an actress for rigidly structured commercial comedy. She tries to find some hard truths in the role and she makes Emily angry vague and even a little dim. The character is parched and not very likable. Steve Carell has his ordinary-guys affect straight parted brown hair elongated almost-Cyrano nose slightly rabbity fear of everything. Even in masochistic roles (""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" ""Date Night"") in which he plays a guy one-upped sexually by other men he always conveys the sense that hes a rational man trying to keep his integrity no matter how bullied and miserable he feels. Its not clear to us that Cal who works at something or other in an office is good at anything in particular except moping around the back yard of the family house at night after he has moved out. Carell trying to keep up with Jacobs smarmy patter in the bar seems more comfortable acting with Ryan Gosling than with Moore. Gosling a serious fellow who usually plays alcoholics or drug addicts or murderers refuses to distance himself from Jacob by parodying the role. His Jacob is not an ironist. He really thinks hes Gods gift to women--apparently no one before Hannah has told him otherwise--and he wants to spread the glory slapping Cal to get his attention and then leading him through a makeover dressing him in Canali and Zegna and teaching him such startlingly original moves as not to talk about himself when he meets a woman in a bar. Applying his superlative new techniques Cal has his mishaps and his successes but the filmmakers believe in soul mates forever and that kind of thing and the audience may not want to think about the aftermath of the movie in which Cal and Emily discuss again and again that magical year they met in high school. ""Friends with Benefits"" is another of those movies in which a man and a woman--in this case Justin Timberlake as Dylan a Los Angeles Web designer who takes a magazine job in New York and Mila Kunis as Jamie the head-hunter who recruits him--spend hours debating Nietzsche Heidegger and Sartre before committing themselves to serious talk of omelettes. No wait. Thats in French movies. In ""Friends with Benefits"" Dylan and Jamie hop into bed and make very particular demands on each other but agree not to indulge in anything so dirty or squalid as emotion. The rule is you may do anything you like as long as you dont feel anything for the other person. James Thurber and E. B. White asked ""Is sex necessary?"" The new trend in romantic comedy is to ask ""Is love necessary?"" This movie is incomparably better than the pathetic Ashton Kutcher-Natalie Portman picture from earlier this year ""No Strings Attached"" in which the man and the woman also friends with benefits go at it in hospital supply closets and hybrid cars. At least Timberlake and Kunis stay in bed. And at least they talk--a great deal in fact and often very cleverly. ""Friends with Benefits"" is fast allusive urban glamorous--clearly the Zeitgeist winner of the summer (the couple take the no-emotion pledge by laying their hands on a tablet Bible app). The writers Keith Merryman David A. Newman and Will Gluck who also directed keep the characters racing ahead each trying to outsmart the other in and out of bed. This mini-genre of shag-buddy pictures is rather coy (theres only one way in American movies that these stories can end). And from the beginning its titillations are mildly delusional can you really have sex with the same person again and again without experiencing any emotion at all? I know it doesnt sound unpleasant but can you really? Despite the mild daring of the concept what keeps these plots going is that old screenwriting standby the fear of commitment. Both Dylan and Jamie are supposed to be emotionally damaged. That is unlike the rest of the world they come from families with problems. But they dont look the least bit damaged; they look and sound terrific and its their healthy sparring that makes the movie fun. Justin Timberlake as he demonstrated playing Sean Parker in ""The Social Network"" is a shrewd actor who knows how to swing his body through a scene. His glib talented Dylan though isnt overly impressed with himself. Timberlake is charming and hes a dynamo when he begins imitating old pop groups (except his own). Mila Kunis of the almond-shaped eyes and the dusky skin is all teasing mischief and easily hurt feelings. Woody Harrelson trying to play a gay sports editor at Dylans magazine twists himself into knots. His performance is ridiculous--half the time you dont know what hes saying--but you enjoy Harrelson enjoying himself. Patricia Clarkson has a comic turn as Jamies alcoholic sex-addicted mom and Richard Jenkins as Dylans dad does what he always does which is to make his part of the movie the best part of the movie. A smart man with Alzheimers painfully aware that hes losing it he lays down for Dylans sake some elementary life lessons. His advice as written is obvious but Jenkins speaks the words with such passionate conviction that he makes them seem like ultimate wisdom.

By David Edelstein Published Jul 24 2011 ShareThis (Photo Courtesy of Roadside Attractions) In her second feature The Future Miranda July has the look of a disappointed ghost that cant fully materialize. Her eyes are the palest blue her skin less milky than skim-milky her body never quite seizing the space. Her panpipe voice is all from the head devoid of chest tones of airwhich might account for both her light-headed aura and her evident gift for self-hypnosis for going back in time to evoke the helpless little girl she once was. The character she played in her first feature Me and You and Everyone We Know was most at home in her cozy bedroom playing with puppets and its easy to imagine July writing scripts that way On some level shell always be a solo performer. But that doesnt hurt her as a dramatist surprisingly. In Julys universe were all solo performers and the more creative the performance the better the chance of connectingmaking a dancewith another soloist. When the creative impulse dies you get the discordant loneliness of The Future. The movie has a frame thats both whimsical and wrenching narration by a scratchy little voice (Julys) thats meant to belong to a cat seen largely as a pair of puppet paws. (Her name is Paw Paw.) The idea is that this cat born in the wild injured and unloved is scheduled to be adopted by an unmarried L.A. couple Sophie (July) and Jason (Hamish Linklater) and the thought makes Paw Paw warm inside They petted me and I accidentally made that sound that said I am a cat and I belong to you and upon making the sound I felt it to be true. But the couples sudden realization that in 30 days (when the sick Paw Paw can leave the shelter) theyll be tied down to a dependent creature (symbolizing a human child or just the burdens of adulthood) fills them with dread. Jason works from their tiny apartment in computer tech support while Sophie teaches (without enthusiasm) dance to little girls. They still have big dreams. But theyre both says Jason five years from 40 which (he adds) is the new 50 after which those dreams will go unrealized. So they have 30 days to be free whimsical spirits and do something big. See AlsoWriting a Duet With Miranda July This could be the premise of a zany comedy but the mood of The Future is from the outset defeatistannoyingly defeatist to be frank. This is one unfun couple. Jason accepts a job selling trees door to door for an environmental group but shows neither faith nor ingenuity. Hes hopelessly ineffectual. Sophie vows to create perform and post on YouTube 30 dances in 30 days but loses the thread on day one. To overcome her paralysis she phones a stranger whose number she finds on the back of a drawing Jason bought. That brings her to Marshall (David Warshofsky) a fiftyish single father with a well-appointed house in the Valley. Meeting him she robotically turns her back and hikes up her skirt so he can take her from behind. Marshall and his house seem like a quick ladder out of the slough of despond. The Future will be an unpleasant shock to many fans of Me and You and Everyone We Know which had its share of dark (and transgressive) elements but was leavened by deadpan jokes romance and moments of blissful transcendence. This ones unleavenedand motorless and squirmy with no safe harbors. I hated watching it almost as much as I loved watching Me and You. But by the end Id come around. July is often derided as self-consciously dotty but those dots are connected. Her life is a hunt for modes of self-expression for peoples creative escape hatches from the (transient) here and (ephemeral) now. An old man (Joe Putterlik) whom Jason meets through a Pennysaver ad displays a series of holiday cards handmade for his wife that are full of bracingly lewd verses. Marshalls daughter Gabriella (Isabella Acres) decides to bury herself in a backyard hole in which she vows to spend the nightand then hours later comes weeping to the door in need of love and a hot bath the full realization of her little-match-girl life having just sunk in. Sophies final quasi-dance inside one of her shirts is a physical meditation on entrapmentand an astonishing distillation of her journey. July is working as hard as any artist alive to find new forms to express the dread of formlessness. The Future has one failed creation Linklaters Jason whos too morose and closed-down too much a mirror imagealmost an incestuous reflectionof Sophies immobilization. July has given him a vaguely artistic impulsehe says he can stop timebut its more vague than artistic. On the other hand Julys failure of imagination might also be a sign of her integrity. Theres no future with a guy with no faith in the future. The makers of Crazy Stupid Love Glenn Ficarra and John Requa are too sane and (commercially) smart to make the craziness consequential and stupidity ruinous After the whirlpools of Miranda July were back on the rom-com mainland. But the movie has an unexpectedly high proportion of delights to groaners and its full of actors youll want to seereal actors like Ryan Gosling Julianne Moore and Emma Stone their edges not blunted by years of making witless buddy movies and chick flicks. Gosling alarmingly sleek and muscular plays a trust-fund-wealthy pickup virtuoso who helps broken newly dumped nebbish Steve Carell rediscover his manhood by teaching him how to dress and chat up the ladiesthough sweetie-pie Carell still moons over Moore his first and only love who slept with her smarmy colleague (Kevin Bacon) and is now a wreck of wayward emotions. This is the sort of quasi-farcical picture in which Carells 13-year-old son (Jonah Bobo) longs for his 17-year-old babysitter (Analeigh Tipton) who longs for Carell who spies on Moore The script by Dan Fogelman is unusually and gratifyingly bisexuali.e. it boasts scenes from both the male and female points of view One of those scenes is a gem a keeper sharp-witted Stone and Gosling in his bachelor pad her pressing him to demonstrate his time-tested seduction routinewhile simultaneously falling for it. Stone is amazingly vivid. She looks hungry to act and sometimes just hungry as when she spontaneously bites Goslings shoulder in a wineshop. Half of the audience will moan Id like some of that shoulder while the other half yells Bite me The Future Directed by Miranda July. R. Crazy Stupid Love. Directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa.

In a time before raunchy R-rated laffers competed for the how-low-can-you-go prize the demand for mature grown-up romantic comedies resulted in pics as wise and wonderfully character-driven as ""Crazy Stupid Love."" Old-fashioned as that might sound theres a fresh insightful feel to this multigenerational love story in which square dad Steve Carell finds himself taking dating tips from ultra-slick ladykiller Ryan Gosling after getting tossed back into the singles scene. Instead of forcing the material to go high-concept or lowbrow Warner Bros. trusts a first-rate cast and rock-solid script to sell auds. Response should be upbeat for this refreshingly upscale offering. Though it refuses to be reduced to a simple one-sentence pitch ""Crazy Stupids"" various storylines revolve around the shattered love life of happily married Cal (Carell) who has a midlife crisis foisted upon him when Emily (Julianne Moore) his wife of nearly 30 years files for divorce. No magic body-swapping. No talking hand puppet. Just a sincere soulful look at how someone who married his high-school sweetheart and never once imagined himself with another woman adjusts to being alone. As written by Dan Fogelman (a Disney-Pixar vet whose credits include ""Tangled"" and ""Cars"") and directed by tonal tightrope walkers Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (""I Love You Phillip Morris"") Cal is the heart-on-his-sleeve sort prone to candid declarations of love and other sentimental gestures. Still he doesnt put up a fight when Emily breaks the bad news. Instead after being elbowed out of the house he sneaks into his former backyard to ensure that the rose bushes dont perish -- behavior Hollywood has trained us to recognize as admirably earnest as opposed to borderline criminal. By way of contrast the film offers Jacob (Gosling) a pick-up artist so bored by the game he spots Cal at the bar and offers to reinvent this loser in his own image. Impossibly ripped and tanned for the role Gosling looks just vulnerable enough to overcome the characters inherent sleaze factor -- a quality that comes in handy later when the lothario finally meets his match. In the meantime hes the sex-magnet Mr. Miyagi to Cals inept Karate Kid to borrow one of ""Crazy Stupids"" endearingly old-school cultural references. Act one feels familiar enough complete with makeover montage as Jacob advises Cal on socially acceptable alternatives to his Supercuts haircut New Balance sneakers and Velcro wallet. If ""crazy"" is throwing away a perfectly good marriage and ""stupid"" is not knowing how to pick yourself up off the floor then ""love"" means never having to apologize for such fashion blunders. Divorce has made Cal accountable for his appearance again and with Jacobs help even the familys teenage babysitter (Analeigh Tipton) cant resist his new look. Back in the bar Cal has no trouble scoring. He takes home an eager-to-please English teacher (Marisa Tomei packing big laughs into a small role) and half a dozen others his newfound confidence seen in one virtuoso tracking shot. Though relatively new to directing ""Bad Santa"" scribes Requa and Ficarra clearly understand the conventions well enough to subvert them relying just a bit too heavily on mellow songs to provide mood cues. Otherwise the tech elements are topnotch Ficarra began his career in an editing room -- excellent training for future comedy directors that pays off here as the pic hits a wide range of emotional notes amid its seriocomic soul-searching. Its a tricky juggling act theyve set for themselves as nearly everyone in the well-rounded ensemble faces relationship snares as confounding as Cals. Jacob finally succeeds in seducing the one girl who turned him down (Emma Stone) only to realize one night with her isnt nearly enough. Emily tentatively dates the co-worker (Kevin Bacon) who cuckolded her husband. Even Cals 13-year-old son Robbie (Jonah Bobo) gets a romantic subplot in which the poor kid crushes on the babysitter. This latter development initially looks like a concession to younger auds and yet on closer inspection Robbies fixation reveals one of ""Crazy Stupids"" key themes When teens fall in love they do it with everything theyve got braving humiliation and rejection in the belief that theyve found the One. Why cant grown-ups love like that the film seems to ask. After all Cal was only 15 when he met his match and if that hopelessly naive kid could see himself three decades later hed never let his wife go.

A shrewdly written comedy with perhaps too many characters and subplots but they nonetheless produce laughs. TWITTER Steve Carell Ryan Gosling Julianne Moore and Emma Stone star in this shrewdly written romantic comedy. The screenplay for the Steve Carell comedy Crazy Stupid Love isnt so much written as manufactured according to precepts found in manuals and teachings by the current breed of Hollywood screenwriting gurus. It starts with a high concept manages its coincidences misunderstandings and character arcs to maximize comic potential and in twists that would undoubtedly tickle those script coaches pulls off not one but two genuine surprises. Its cleverness however masks a lack of real heart. When a movie plays an opening sequence -- where a wife surprises her husband by asking for a divorce -- strictly for laughs with perky music in the background you know the film cares only about audience reactions not its characters. Nevertheless Crazy is clever give it that. The script sets up rote situations then turns them on their head or takes them in unexpected directions. Given the dearth of inventive adult comedies in the marketplace Warner Bros. may experience crazy good box office with this romantic comedy. PHOTOS Summer Movie Guide Crazy Stupid Love is that rara avis that has more directors than writers. Dan Fogelman has the sole credit on the screenplay directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa. His basic idea is to display three generations of romantic attraction to demonstrate that when it comes to love experience counts for little. Indeed the 13-year-old son of Carells forty something Cal Weaver is more focused and adroit than his dad when it comes to pursuing a ""soul mate."" The fiendishly plotted comedy starts to uncoil when Cals wife and former high-school sweetheart Emily (Julianne Moore) abruptly requests a divorce. Thrust unprepared into the singles scene Cal who wears sneakers coats a size too big and a wounded heart on his sleeve is clueless. VIDEO Crazy Stupid Love Second Trailer and Additional Scenes Released Taking pity for no apparent reason other than the script needs him to a supremely successful ladys man Jacob (Ryan Gosling who is nicely maturing into leading man status in studio movies) takes Cal under his wing to teach him all the right moves. Jacob also drastically overhauls that woeful wardrobe. Jacobs own polished pick-up routines work on a dazzling array of dazzling women until it hits a wall The player cant elicit anything but laughter and sarcasm from law student Hannah (Emma Stone who seems to be in every movie this summer that doesnt require digital effects). Hannah somehow sees through every line. Again the script pretty much requires this for later developments. Meanwhile two more romances stumble along at the Weaver household Son Robbie (Jonah Bobo) pines for his sisters 17-year-old babysitter Jessica (Analeigh Tipton) while his mom tries to make sense of the adulterous relationship she foolishly began with an office co-worker (Kevin Bacon playing it too smarmy for the relationship to be credible). STORY Ryan Gosling I Wish Steve Carell Was My Dad Jacobs instructions finally pays off as Cal scores first with a pretty barfly (Marisa Tomei in possibly the best performance in the movie only it seems to belong to a different movie) then continues on with a somewhat implausible succession of lovelies. In the scripts most poorly engineered subplot Hannah suffers a crushing disappointment in her passive pursuit of a lawyer played by recording artist Josh Groban. This all too blatantly causes her to rebound into Jacobs startled arms to instigate a genuine relationship that takes both parties by surprise. The script then quite adroitly throws in two startling revelation about cunningly hidden relationships among the characters which leads to a climatic free-for-all that brings nearly everyone to an unplanned showdown in the Weaver backyard. STORY Steve Carell Not Starring on The Office Is a Little Weird In its headlong pursuit of laughs the screenplay runs by several opportunities to explore its characters in greater depth. It would have been nice to see Jacobs advice to Cal actually have a beneficial impact on how he now treats his estranged taken-for-granted wife. And it would have been equally nice to see Cals clear adoration of his family have an impact on his determined-to-remain-single advisor. The movie suggests these things happen but you witness neither. The movie borrows so heavily from other movies --but always putting an inventive twist on these borrowings mind you -- that it even has fun with its movie references. This includes a sequence between Gosling and Stone where her character demands he bed her in an athletic ""R rated"" scene as opposed to a ""PG-13 rated"" one. But the two actually start to talk about their lives one thing leads to another and the sequence winds up PG-13 after all. Yet this is one of the more amusing riffs in any recent film on the MPAAs rating system. The movie suffers perhaps from too many characters and subplots but all the actors appear to have fun with their characters. Carell who has the market cornered for playing schnooks -- his best movie performance remains Dan in Real Life however -- finds something new here by suggesting that there can be worse things than being a schnook. Gosling keeps it real yet amusingly satirizes his screen lothario character. STORY Ryan Goslings Top 5 Roles Moore conveys the angst-ridden internal push-pull of a midlife crisis while Stone gets a little lost in her inconsistent character but is never less than winning. Tomei plays the comedy very broadly but gets more than her share of laughs. The younger actors Bobo and Tipton shine in roles that have greater depth than some of the adult ones. All tech credits are pro in a film shot in Los Angeles but aiming to look like Anywhere USA. However the frequently used bar set with wall-to-wall ready and willing beautiful single women is located in Nowhere USA.
