Andrews great goal is to become a free man capable of love and sexual expression. And by showing his willingness to accept human mortality rather than exist forever in robotic loneliness this futuristic fable based on stories by Isaac Asimov addresses some intriguing notions about where artificial intelligence ends and biological life begins. Its hard to appreciate the philosophical details however when director Chris Columbus working once again with his Mrs. Doubtfire star Robin Williams seals this comedy in an impenetrable bubble of hollow humanism. The one-dimensional message factory-sealed for our protection against any disorderly thoughts or emotions of our own is that freedom and individuality are nice. Williams is extra nice of course. Andrews human beloved played with stilted poise by Embeth Davidtz (Schindlers List) is super-nice. And youre nice too. As the decades roll on and Andrew upgraded begins to look more and more like an ageless Robin Williams all the people around him age in a flourish of latex wrinkles and talcum-powdered hair. If as Bicentennial Man implies we are all destined to look like Mrs. Doubtfire the future is bleaker than science-fiction visionaries could ever have dreamed.

Starring Robin Williams Embeth Davidtz Sam Neill Oliver Platt Wendy Crewson. Directed by Chris Columbus. (PG. 131 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Maybe because its about a robot ""Bicentennial Man"" has a certain slow mechanical quality. The new Robin Williams film directed by San Franciscan Chris Columbus and set on local turf opens today at Bay Area theaters. Its a bit strange and strained. More syrupy melodrama than comedy this movie based on a story by the late Isaac Asimov doesnt have much of the usual Williams manic antics. What the movie really wants to do is grip your heart (sound the alarms) but it musters only a slight pinch. Thats what happens when you put Williams in a plastic suit so he cant do his full dance. Whats really exciting about the movie is the futuristic vision of San Francisco -- and life in general -- as the story lumbers forward over a 200-year period (some will say the running time seems like centuries too). People have cleaner houses cooler cars lots of robots running errands or functioning as pets and one hopes back scratchers. The city is even more full of highrises but it gleams with sleek smart loveliness a bustling urban center full of hover vehicles elegantly arched overpasses elevated stations and parking places all punctuated by the leftovers of a colorful history including the unmistakable rattle of cable cars. Theres a whole lot of computer- generated imagery going on in this film and its way cool. The story starts out in the ""near future"" where we meet the very rich Martin family consisting of Richard (Sam Neill); his wife called Maam (Wendy Crewson); and two kids Grace (Angela Landis) and Amanda who is to be nicknamed Little Miss (Hallie Kate Eisenberg the Pepsi girl in TV ads). Being very rich (its a Chris Columbus movie) they can afford the latest household goody a new NDR-114 robot. The robot looks suspiciously like Robin Williams. In fact Williams acts in the robot costume for much of the film moving mechanically talking a refined robotic English because he is a smart cultured robot. Almost from the start we get the gist that Andrew the robot is going to want to become human -- and his quest to do that is basically the story. A lot can happen in 200 years. While a robot stays a robot -- with occasional upgrades to keep it clomping around and processing thoughtful or funny phrases -- humans go through human transitions. There arent many upgrades that can defeat the aging process and much of the sentiment of this film derives from humans moving on pawns of the natural order. Andrew experiences extraordinary moments of care from humans allied with the Martin father he calls Sir and with Little Miss who grows up to be a gorgeous adult Miss played by Embeth Davidtz. In subsequent generations Davidtz plays Portia granddaughter of the original Martins and she becomes Andrews love interest. You cant keep a good robot down. Two other considerations No movie has depicted the look of human aging as accurately and coincidentally as wonderfully as this one; and second for Oliver Platt fans ""Bicentennial Man"" features him in a good but too-brief part as a maverick computer wizard helping Andrew fulfill his heart-rending destiny. Can we ask for more? We can. ..

This long-arc story of a robots 200-year journey to become a human being benefits from compelling thematic notions and wizardly visual robotic and makeup effects but bogs down due to slack storytelling and conventional approach. An ambitious tale handled in a dawdling sentimental way ""Bicentennial Man"" filters the prescient vision of the late sci-fi writer Isaac Asimov through the touchy-feely sensibility of the ""new"" Robin Williams. This long-arc story of a robots 200-year journey to become a human being benefits from compelling thematic notionsand wizardly visual robotic and makeup effects but bogs down due to slack storytelling and an insipidly conventional approach. Since the pros will mean more to general audiences than the cons as will the presence of Williams in an odd but accessible role ""Bicentennial"" should rack up strong millennial B.O. Partially based on a long short story written by Asimov on the occasion of the American bicentennial in 1976 Nicholas Kazans screenplay deals with issues regarding the appropriateness morality and rights of artificially created entities the definition of humanity and the desirability of immortality that are if anything far more pertinent now than they were a quarter-century ago. Unfortunately it takes about an hour for the film to even suggest that it intends to be about anything other than a futuristic tin man or that it will have such an epic scope. Furthermore the higher the stakes grow in the later stages the more director Chris Columbus resorts to obviousness and emotional pandering. The poky first half generates only sporadic light laughs but will no doubt hold the interest of kids and easy-to-please adults as they try to discern whether Williams is actually inside the metallic-looking plastic suit that encases Andrew a genial robot not unlike a grown-up Teletubby thats been acquired by the upscale Bay Area Martin family as a combination maid-butler-cook-nanny. Unfailingly polite and obedient Andrew has been programmed to obey three laws (first promulgated in Asimovs landmark 1950 book ""I Robot"") that he not harm humans that he obey human orders and that he protect his own existence -- the latter two with the proviso that they not conflict with the preceding laws. The robots looks and movements created by vet special effects designer Steve Johnson are undeniably intriguing; the face and stature roughly resemble those of the star but its clear that even details such as the eyes and eyebrows are mechanical with no human elements visible. Gently amusing swishing sound effects accompany Andrews movements and there are tip-offs in the vocal and physical timing that Williams is present but after a while the stunt begins to wear thin; aside from little incidents such as a bratty girl ordering Andrew to jump out the window no dramatic conflict or even engaging character interaction figures in the proceedings. But the head of the family who is simply called Sir (Sam Neill) eventually comes to suspect that there might be more to Andrew than metal fiberglass and wire and the robot shows a remarkable aptitude for sculpting and fashioning elegant clocks. Over the years he also becomes the closest confidant of one of Sirs daughters Little Miss (Embeth Davidtz as an adult) who would surely marry the gentle honest and understanding Andrew rather than her fiance if he were only human. Finally about an hour in the film lets on that it has grander thematic and geographic destinations in mind. Andrew who has accumulated a small fortune over the decades informs the aging Sir that he would like to be given his freedom. Then 16 years later when Sir dies Andrew embarks upon a long odyssey to locate others of his ilk who have largely been junked or reprogrammed. Search concludes back in San Francisco where he finds the bouncy femme robot Galatea and her owner Rupert Burns (Oliver Platt) a benign Dr. Frankenstein who inspired by Andrews enthusiasm and cooperation begins crossing the scientific frontier between what is man-made and what might be construed as a true man. Ruperts brilliance enables Andrew to ""upgrade"" to human physical specifications even while remaining technically a robot; benefit here is that Williams is finally able to emerge from his encasement to be seen for who he is. Reunited with Little Miss whos now an attractive older woman he also makes the acquaintance of her look-alike granddaughter Portia. Her love story with Andrew drives the final time-jumping stretch of the picture which sees Andrew making appearances before a high-level international council in the hopes of being officially declared a human being and altering his genetic makeup so that he does not have to experience the eternal disappointment of seeing his loved ones die off while he remains ageless. The same story could easily have been told so that its themes would have hit home in sharp and meaningful ways. But Columbus approach is intended to cloak such topics as mortality and human identity in the warm glow of greeting card sentiment which renders the prescription palatable for mass consumption but hopelessly diluted. With the nature of his role effectively placing a straitjacket on his usual shtick Williams emits expressions of personality as well as anyone could under the circumstances; at the same time the underlying urge behind the performance is an obvious and sometimes cloying cry for sympathy for a being who just wants to love and be loved. From a comic p.o.v. there is intermittent amusement but only a handful of outright laughs. Characters design and other future-gazing effects are excellent including imaginative speculation about upcoming changes in the cityscapes of Washington D.C. and San Francisco the latter notable for a double-decker Golden Gate Bridge. Supporting performances particularly by Davidtz Neill and Platt are generally understated and appealing while production values are sleek and strong.

Andrews great goal is to become a free man capable of love and sexual expression. And by showing his willingness to accept human mortality rather than exist forever in robotic loneliness this futuristic fable based on stories by Isaac Asimov addresses some intriguing notions about where artificial intelligence ends and biological life begins. Its hard to appreciate the philosophical details however when director Chris Columbus working once again with his Mrs. Doubtfire star Robin Williams seals this comedy in an impenetrable bubble of hollow humanism. The one-dimensional message factory-sealed for our protection against any disorderly thoughts or emotions of our own is that freedom and individuality are nice. Williams is extra nice of course. Andrews human beloved played with stilted poise by Embeth Davidtz (Schindlers List) is super-nice. And youre nice too. As the decades roll on and Andrew upgraded begins to look more and more like an ageless Robin Williams all the people around him age in a flourish of latex wrinkles and talcum-powdered hair. If as Bicentennial Man implies we are all destined to look like Mrs. Doubtfire the future is bleaker than science-fiction visionaries could ever have dreamed.
