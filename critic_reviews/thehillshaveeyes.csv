Starring Aaron Stanford Kathleen Quinlan Vinessa Shaw and Emilie de Ravin. Directed by Alexandre Aja. (Rated R. 107 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Wes Cravens original ""The Hills Have Eyes"" released in 1977 seems like a Cold War relic now. Our nations artists are so obsessed with terrorism these days even Batman is planning to put the smackdown on al Qaeda. In a world where Osama bin Laden still walks free who really cares if the government conducted some nuclear tests in Nevada a few decades ago and a few stupid miners didnt get out in time? With producer Craven watching over his shoulder Alexandre Aja directs and co-writes the ""Hills"" remake -- but he wisely focuses on gruesome spectacle over politics. The film once again starts with some deformed homicidal maniacs committing spectacularly gory and disturbing acts. But then the plot takes a welcome detour wrapping up with the crowd-pleasing qualities of a good Bruce Willis movie. (""Die Hard"" with mutants?) If studios insist on remaking classic horror films this is definitely the way to do it. The new ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is filled with great characters over-the-top violence and the type of truly bizarre events that suggest there were some insane personalities on the set in real life. Much like that Marlon Brando/Val Kilmer version of ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"" that came out in 1996 you get the impression that the writers and actors were having contests to see who could stuff the most peyote in their mouths. The movie begins with the extremely dysfunctional Carter family traveling across the desert on the way to San Diego. Like the Griswold family taking a wrong turn in the Family Truckster they end up in the middle of nowhere with zero contact with the outside world -- except the aforementioned hill-dwelling mutants. The beginning borders on plodding but all is forgiven about 45 minutes into the film when the antagonists come into full view in a scene of extreme depravity and violence. We probably shouldnt let another paragraph pass without pointing out that ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is one of the most starkly violent R-rated movies of the past few years. Theres a scene where one of the bad guys points a gun at a babys head -- and its maybe the 12th-most disturbing image in the movie. The cast is outstanding filled with a blend of reliable character actors and interesting up-and-comers. Standing out are Ted Levine (Buffalo Bill in ""Silence of the Lambs"") as the familys patriarch Emilie de Ravin (the blonde with the baby on ""Lost"") as his spoiled daughter and especially Aaron Stanford (Pyro in ""X-Men 2"") as the weasel son-in-law. ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is a good movie for the first half and then becomes great at about the one-hour mark. Without giving too much away the movie flips horror conventions midway through turning the victims into the aggressors. Its a credit to Aja and co-screenwriter Gregory Levasseur that they can take the weakest character from the first half of the film and create semi-believable circumstances that turn that person into a badass. The only thing that gets crowds cheering more than an underdog action hero who kicks butt is a dog that does the same -- and theres a German shepherd in this movie thats more resourceful than all of those slackers in ""Eight Below"" put together. In the middle of the movie as the plot holes involving the nuclear testing are filled the themes arent particularly thought-provoking. Considering what happened in New Orleans last year even ""The Day After Tomorrow"" seems more relevant for our times than ""The Day After."" Because falling buildings have replaced mushroom clouds in most of our nightmares the movie must thrive purely on its entertainment value and it does. Cold War or no Cold War ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is a blast. -- Advisory ""The Hills Have Eyes"" begins kind of like that first ""The Brady Bunch"" Grand Canyon episode except instead of high jinks in a ghost town this film contains profanity sexual assaults gunplay a mutilated dog a baby in danger eviscerations impalings dismemberments an exploding head and one character who is slowly burned to death.

"Graphic gore with a side of family angst -- hey pass the popcorn - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Angst Graphic gore with a side of family angst -- hey pass the popcornmovies - reviewMarch 10 2006|By Roger Moore Sentinel Movie CriticThe Hills Have Eyes is Wolf Creek with Geiger counters instead of ""Gdays."" The plot points are close enough that youd think a lawyer would have taken note.Except that we know Wes Craven made the original Hills a movie about lost suburbanites stalked by mutant victims of nuclear testing back in 1977.This Hills was made by Alexandre Aja who directed the relentless bloody and tricky French horror film High Tension. He brings his eye without pity to this story of a hapless family made to pay a gory price for Americas decades of above-ground nuclear testing. Its a bloodbath of exploding heads pickax pokings finger choppings and guns that are never big enough to stop the terror.The original effective but kind of silly had a not-at-all-subtle anti-nuke political subtext. Theres something about Red State/Blue State Americas gun-toting role in the world in this one though it doesnt quite pay off. It was directed by a Frenchman. He didnt get that.You know the formula. A road off the main drag an extended family in an SUV and Airstream trailer. The stop at the remote gas station -- the trap.Next thing you know ex-cop Dad (Ted Levine) is pulling out the pistols. Teenage son (Dan Byrd) is entrusted with one. Bespectacled son-in-law (Aaron Stanford) is mocked.""Hes a Democrat. He doesnt believe in guns.""Mom (Kathleen Quinlan) prays. Sullen teen daughter Brenda (Emilie de Ravin) pouts.And married daughter Lynne (Vinessa Shaw) tries to look after her baby and keep the peace. Especially since Republican Dad has taken a shortcut gotten them lost and wrecked the SUV in the worst place on Earth. Not that anybodys casting blame.Dont get too attached to any of these folks. Not even the pets (two German shepherds two parakeets). Because ""theres something out there.""Ajas style is to try and make us feel for his victims by showing us extended death throes. Its very unpleasant going. He shows no mercy and spares us no detail -- heads exploding impalings dismemberments. As in High Tension a coward must be vilified by the audience before he or she can turn hero.But Aja gives away the mystery too easily here. We get close-up peeks at the freaks doing the nastiness right from the start. The best scares are a shadow flashing in front of the camera. Aja is into blood.It cant touch Saw or Hostel in terms of agony or When a Stranger Calls or Final Destination for wit. These Hills are more to be endured than enjoyed.But what is almost certain to be the top film at the box office this weekend will earn that cash honestly -- off young horror fans.Theres a release in these movies in which characters are picked off and then start to fight back. Its primal and best of all its communal. Horror movies dont work on DVD. So maybe we are creating a new generation of movie-goers -- one exploding head at a time.

Saw Wolf Creek and the like have sent the genre veering from creepy frights to sadistic suffering. No pain -- no game. In this game the deck is stacked. Monstrous murderers get a free pass to stab rend and mutilate. They snuff we cringe and retribution is a no-show. Thats not a problem in The Hills Have Eyes a wrenching remake of Wes Cravens raw cult classic of 1977. You want catharsis rather than a slow death march? The Hills Have Eyes is your movie. As in the original a vacationing family takes a desert detour and is attacked by cannibalistic savages. Yet these Hills are alive with more than excruciating victimization. French director Alexandre Aja also carves tragedy and pathos from the carnage. Best of all he allows his protagonists to strike back rather than just join a body count. Aja even shows restraint allowing mood characters and story to simmer till it all reaches a bloody boil. Heck no one is killed until midway -- when all hell breaks loose. The film has good performances by a solid cast including Kathleen Quinlan and Ted Levine as the clans parents and Losts Emilie de Ravin as their youngest daughter. Theres also a teen son an older daughter her pacifist husband their infant child a pair of German shepherds and two unfortunate caged birds. Hills new mix of old elements somehow feels fresh. Like the first film it strongly evokes the rural nightmares and devilish dining of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre but also blends elements of Tourist Trap and Straw Dogs. The film also tweaks Cravens original concept tracing the marauders to 50s nuke testing and radiation mutations. The tests residue includes an eerie government-built ghost town of 50s serenity strewn with mannequins in frozen smiles. The violence is hideous and hard-core. One sustained scene of blood-splattered madness and a burning at the stake are as rough as it gets. But behind such torture lies soulful tragedy heroic resolve and kick-butt self-defense. The payback is choreographed and scored for maximum rabble-rousing effect. In short its clobbering time. Let Saws copycats keep making horror films in which helpless victims simply suffer. The Hills Have Eyes raises its sights to include vengeful satisfying justice. bruce.westbrookchron.com Todays Deals Vienna Sofa Sleeper for 249 + pickup at Walmart True Religion Mens Leather Belt for 18 + free shipping Banana Republic Extra 50% off sale items + free shipping w/ 50 10x30-Foot Gazebo Tent Canopy for 75 + free shipping Powered by Contests Enter to win concert tickets airfare and hotel More Entertainment News Rolling Stones Lash Out at Donald Trump (Again) Over Song Use Daveed Diggs Renee Elise Goldsberry to Leave Hamilton Broken Social Scene Working on New Album Steve Young of M/A/R/R/S Pump Up the Volume Fame Dead Calvin Harris Taylor Swift Song Co-Write Questions We Still...

And its not just the malice of predators toward prey. Its the disdain the filmmakers have for their characters - killers and victims alike. Horror has become cinemas anti-empathy genre. Movies like ""Saw"" or ""Hostel"" seem bent on giving audiences characters we either dont know dont care about or actively dislike. Granted it makes the killing easier to stomach when it comes - and it always does. Some viewers might even find themselves rooting for it. (A recent exception though not much better for it was the Aussie slasher flick ""Wolf Creek."") In ""The Hills Have Eyes"" there is a point to the scorn. On a misbegotten trip through the New Mexican desert a middle-class family pulls its hulking Chevy Suburban and Airstream into a rundown gas station. An American flag flaps on the antenna. Big Bob Carter (Ted Levine) is a retired police detective and fairly full of himself. Kathleen Quinlan plays mom Ethel with a not unappealing portrait of 50s-style passivity. In tow are their decidedly contemporary kids Brenda Bobby and Lynn; son-in-law Doug (Aaron Stanford); grandbaby Catherine; and Beauty and Beast two glorious German shepherds. The cause of this haphazard sojourn? Bob and Ethels 25th anniversary. Soon after the odd pit stop Big Bob takes a rutted road suggested by the gas station attendant. Vehicular disaster strikes and the Carters fates become questionable. Written by Aja and Gregory Levasseur and based on Wes Cravens 1977 original the films opening credits work as a jarring prologue. Members of the duck-and-cover generations will recognize much of the footage depicting ersatz towns with their bomb-test dummy citizens. Footage of mushroom clouds and snuffed-out wooden structures are spliced with images of deformed babies and newspaper clippings about a mining town. Talented character actor Tom Bower plays the unhinged proprietor of the forsaken outpost. Its not loneliness that has got him ornery and jittery. Its the company he keeps. In the dun-colored hills and the ghost town behind them live the genetically scrambled progeny of a group of miners who refused to leave their homes and livelihoods when the government started claiming the desert for A-bomb tests. Although we havent yet laid eye on them weve witnessed what they can do with a pickax. One of them Ruby (Laura Ortiz) mediates between the gas station attendant and her compatriots who have names like names like Pluto Jupiter Goggle. She brings him ill-gotten gains to trade for supplies. On a visit she swipes Bobbys red hoodie from the SUV becoming a scurrying red riding hood in a very grim fable of family - and national - dynamics. A sweet moment comes when the two fathers who dont much like each other go for help leaving Mom Lynn (Vinessa Shaw) and Brenda (Emilie de Ravin) Bobby (Dan Byrd) and the baby behind. Tension briefly evaporates but this respite cant save this family from the looming brutality. The MPAA warns of ""gruesome violence throughout."" Mushroom clouds and payback. People so damaged and morally deformed by U.S. government policies they become hateful others. Women and children become the victims of male terror and resentment. Sounds an awful lot like this ""Hills"" redux wants to say something about the moment we live in. At a time when an intelligent horror creator like ""Hostels"" Eli Roth says the reason for his particular brand of onscreen sadism was that he wanted to see how far he could push the R rating the ambitions propelling ""Hills"" are almost refreshing. Almost. Consider it as one of the first decent ""Why do they hate us"" horror flicks. So impersonal yet focused is the mayhem that the victims of it cant help being perplexed. They cant help being left with that sad question caked on their bloody lips.

"Fun Hills really gets the blood flowing - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Fun Hills really gets the blood flowing By Erin Meister Globe Correspondent  |  March 10 2006 One nuclear family meets another in The Hills Have Eyes"" a giddy and horrifying remake of Wes Cravens 70s cult slasher by the same name.When a tightknit clan of suburban Americans gets sidetracked on a driving vacation they wind up stranded in the middle of a desert that secretly crackles with life -- and death. Newly retired detective Big"" Bob Carter (Ted Levine) and his brood drive off the beaten path on their cross-country trip landing themselves in the middle of a wasteland of abandoned atomic test sites. In the devastated hills lives a family of radiation-mutated inexplicably cannibalistic savages who terrorize kill and eat whatever -- or whoever -- crosses their path. When the blood starts flowing its up to Carters resourceful teenage son Bobby (Dan Byrd) and neurotic son-in-law Doug (Aaron Stanford) to keep the monsters at bay and the family together.Thanks to a new screenplay written by two young French filmmakers -- Alexandre Aja (who also directs) and Gregory Levasseur the pair behind the recent High Tension"" -- and production assistance by Craven himself this Hills"" is a far cry from its cheesy and predictable predecessor. Gruesome"" doesnt begin to describe the horrors that are revealed on-screen here From complete dismemberment to extreme shotgun violence Aja amp; Co. not only pull out the stops on this one they decimate them. Best (and worst) of all is that the most horrendous of the mutant clans brutalities take place in broad daylight leaving the family without much hope or refuge.Filmed in almost maddeningly sharp digital detail the goriest of scenes wind up being a nauseating confusion of blood and body parts so gracefully filmed and edited that the ghastly action is as enthralling as it is completely repulsive. Keeping true to its cult-classic roots Ajas film interrupts the terror to occasionally be profoundly corny The music swells to grandiose proportions whenever Doug triumphs at some impossible feat and at one point he actually uses a tiny American flag as a lethal weapon against the nuclear bogeymen.Despite the truly traumatizing gore Hills"" is surprisingly artful and believe it or not about as much fun as a grisly horror movie can be. Its the kind of extreme fright-fest that inspires an audiences bubbling nervous laughter one-eye-closed cringing and probably a pretty shaky call home to mom after high-tailing it out of the theater.Erin Meister can be reached at erinmeisterhotmail.com.

Its worse than that. Nothing is right about this ridiculous horror schlockfest. Pluto (Michael Bailey Smith) attacks Brenda (Emilie de Ravin) in The Hills Have Eyes. Fox Searchlight Pictures There is a strange lack of tension and no real jolts of fear in this remake of the 1977 Wes Craven film about a family traveling through the New Mexico desert who are terrorized by deformed flesh-eating mutants. But there is plenty of gore. The movie also has one of the queasiest rape sequences in recent memory. The teenage victim is understandably traumatized but after screaming and crying incoherently all night the next day she is industrious and capable as if the attack by two monstrous fiends never happened. Ted Levine and Kathleen Quinlan star as a couple celebrating their 25th anniversary with their two teens a twentysomething daughter her husband their baby and a couple of German shepherds. Little wonder that nobody appears eager to take this road trip across the southwest to San Diego. About the movieThe Hills Have Eyes  1/2Stars Ted Levine Kathleen Quinlan Aaron Stanford Emilie de Ravin Dan Byrd  Director Alexandre Aja Distributor Fox Searchlight Rating R for strong gruesome violence and terror throughout and for language Running time 1 hour 29 minutes Opens nationwide Friday After stopping at a decrepit gas station they take the creepy attendants advice on a shortcut and end up broken down in a desolate area after hidden spikes in the road trash their tires. The family becomes fodder for the zombie-like killers who live in the hills smack in the middle of an abandoned nuclear-testing site. (One of the mutants bears an uncanny resemblance to Keith Richards.) The movie ricochets between relentless savagery lulls between attacks and plans for revenge. When the family patriarch doesnt return after walking into town for help the son-in-law tells the teenage boy that if Dad doesnt return by midnight theyll go out looking for him. Of course. Skulking about a threatening desert late at night is always a smart plan. The son-in-law a nerdy cellphone salesman who is staunchly against guns viciously takes on the mutated monsters proving himself ludicrously indomitable. He finds weapons in the darndest places and uses them mercilessly. More incredibly he continues to fight after he is repeatedly and horrifically attacked. Dont expect logic coherence or even resolution here. The film borrows from TVs Lost with its cliffhanger style. For the sequel perhaps a weekend getaway to Three Mile Island?

With Enrique Arreola Diego Catano. (87 min.)Flama and Moko are teenagers with an apartment to themselves so naturally they order in a large pizza and indulge in a marathon afternoon of ""Halo"" on the Xbox. Their bliss is interrupted by a pesky 16-year-old neighbor Rita who wants to use the oven to bake a cake and ends up giving one of the boys kissing lessons. The pizza arrives 11 seconds late and since the delivery service promises a free pie if they overshoot the 30-minute guarantee the boys refuse to pay. Deliveryman Ulises thinks hes being conned and refuses to leave. The Mexican writer-director Fernando Eimbcke attempts to give this story a melancholy overlay but its main interest is in its confirmation that teenagers are pretty much the same everywhere. (In Spanish with English subtitles.) Grade B- Peter RainerSex/Nudity 4 scenes of innuendo and frank talk. Violence 4 scenes. Profanity 26 strong expressions.

Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Ah the things I endure for you dear reader. This remake of the 1977 Wes Craven horrorfest strands a vacationing family in an abandoned nuclear testing zone. The desert may look barren but fear not bloodthirsty irradiated mutants soon show up to party hearty. Alexandre Aja directs in full glop mode and the cast includes a few performers including Ted Levine (from ""Monk"") Robert Joy and Kathleen Quinlan who probably wish they were elsewhere.

With Tim Allen Kristin Davis. (98 min.)Tim Allen plays a lawyer who is - as if by magic - transformed into a sheepdog. All flea-bitten canine puns and wordplay aside Disneys remake of its own 1959 hit is a serviceable comedy. While Allen does not have the natural charm of Fred MacMurrays paterfamilias in the original he nonetheless plays the gag consistently enough to not seem completely ridiculous. An anti-animal-testing agenda is a bit heavy and oversimplified but at least it is not a beast as dull as ""Doogal"" or as piddling as ""The Pink Panther.""Grade C+- Robert NewtonStill in ReleaseUltraviolet (PG-13)Director Kurt Wimmer. With Milla Jovovich Cameron Bright. (85 min.)When an experimental virus has turned many citizens into vampires the corporate-church-government alliance that caused all the trouble develops an antivampire weapon. The vampires send warrior Violet to steal it but when the weapon turns out to be an infected boy her maternal instinct is to save the boys life. Its ultraviolent but the digital photography makes it look more like a comic book than any live-action flick in memory. Grade D+- M.K. TerrellSex/Nudity 1 scene of partial nudity. Violence 28 scenes.

Unfortunately director Alexandre Aja appears to have shot his bloody load during this early sequence as the rest of the film fails to live up to such early promise. In fact if youve seen Wes Cravens 1972 original its probably best to skip the next 45 minutes as its practically a scene-for-scene retread involving a squabbling family a cross-country trip a wrong turn and a band of mutant cannibals hungry for flesh. The second half of the flick features a few detours including a little more motive and back story involving the creation of the ultimate nuclear family. Yet while the screenplay is tight the performances solid and the direction superior to many of the horror reconstructions churned out in recent months one cant help thinking that The Hills Have Eyes is a rather pointless exercise that reinforces the age-old adage If it aint broke dont remake it.

Opening frame multiplex mob scenes and ancillary gold seem assured. While loyalists of Wes Cravens cult pic ""The Hills Have Eyes"" will no doubt disagree about Gallic horror enfant terrible Alexandre Ajas Craven-produced remake the rest of the audience will feel bloodied and bruised by the end credits. More brutal and less ingenious than Fox Searchlights last horror venture ""28 Days Later"" pic feels more like a Dimension release and in that sense will test Foxs specialized arms ability to milk every last dime out of a genre item. Opening frame multiplex mob scenes and ancillary gold seem assured. Ajas breakthrough French slasher pic ""High Tension"" has its supporters (including of course Craven) but its critics point to a cynical style-for-styles-sake attitude merciless and inhuman feelings for the films victims and a weakness for extremely manipulative narrative trickery. Some of Aja and regular co-screenwriter Gregory Levasseurs worst tendencies however are muted by their decision to stick to much of Cravens original story betraying an unabashed love of the 1977 cult hit. Yet theres a distinct letdown after an astonishing and unexpected opening section as if the gravitational pull toward trash-kitsch horror was too much to resist. Surprising intro takes place in a present-day New Mexico (with Moroccan locales subbing) covered in radioactive dust from years of surface nuke testing in the 1940s and 50s. Extreme dread looms as ghoulish killers scamper around the desert. After a ""Dr. Strangelove""-like title sequence that actually mixes nuke test images with Vietnamese babies deformed by Agent Orange and a creepy few minutes involving a half-crazed gas station attendant (Tom Bower) more conventional action nearly matching Cravens film takes over. In keeping with new pics strategy of placing one foot in the nuke-obsessed 50s and one in the present a family led by retired Cleveland cop ""Big Bob"" Carter (Ted Levine) en route to San Diego in a Gulfstream camper is both slightly retro and a microcosm of post-9/11 Yanks. While Bob is a gun-toting Republican son-in-law Doug (Aaron Stanford) is a wimpy Democrat with a wife Lynn (Vinessa Shaw) and a baby Catherine. Bobs kids Bobby (Dan Byrd) and Brenda (Emilie de Ravin) are respectively nerdy and sexy-callow. Mom Ethel (Kathleen Quinlan) is a former ""hippie chick"" whos now religious. After stupidly opting for a back road shortcut that results in a tire blowout caused by spikes in the road the family starts bickering. This delays the first encounter between the clan and the ""eyes"" in them thar hills-an extended multi-generational family of mutants. Unlike Cravens circle of cave people who resembled Flintstones intermarried with the Manson family these horrifically damaged folk are polemically depicted as victims of U.S. Cold War policy. Besides proving to be a faithful mimic of Cravens filmmaking Aja pours on the gore. But where Ajas version really leaps beyond Cravens both atmospherically and on the violence scale is in the second hour which has Doug discovering his inner Rambo as he hunts down the mutants to their hideout in an old government testing ""village"" (a piece de resistance by production designer Joseph Nemec III) complete with mid-century modern homes decor and eerie nuke-singed American family mannequins. Big Brain (Desmond Askew)provides pics scariest and saddest image. The notion of drawing some sympathy to the savage family appears clever enough; but ultimately it backfires when ? patriarch Papa Jupiter is seen munching on a battered corpse. Stanford a long ways from his ""Tadpole"" debut seems to relish Dougs transformation from peacenik to red-eyed revenger as does the impressive Byrd in a scaled-down teen version of Doug. Moroccan-based lensing by Maxime Alexandre is considerably visceral but its starkly deprived of New Mexicos unmatchable piercing natural light. As the freaks come out of the hills ace visual makeup effects artists Gregory Nicotero and Howard Berger take over the film with a cornucopia of anatomical extremities. Composer team Tomandandys unnerving atmospheric score reaffirms their ability to create an alternative sound to standard Hollywood music recyclings.
