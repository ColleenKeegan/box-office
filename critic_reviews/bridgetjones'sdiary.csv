Informed by author Helen Fieldings droll observations of a year in the life of her weight-obsessed love-starved heroine the novel hit a bulls-eye with women on both sides of the Atlantic. As a film however item misses its mark failing to capitalize on the staccato rhythms and sardonic wit of Bridgets inner life. As the Bible of thirtysomething single women everywhere ""Bridget Joness Diary"" is one of the most eagerly anticipated book-to-screen adaptations in recent memory. Informed by author Helen Fieldings droll observations of a year in the life of her weight-obsessed love-starved heroine the novel hit a bulls-eye with women on both sides of the Atlantic. As a film however item misses its mark failing to capitalize on the staccato rhythms and sardonic wit of Bridgets inner life. That said pics pre-sell value is solid enough to suggest initially healthy B.O. that could continue to generate decent returns even as it will inevitably disappoint some of the books devotees. Introduced in a series of columns in the U.K.s Independent Fieldings lovably imperfect Bridget with her incessant calorie counting cigarette smoking and wine-swilling inflected the British vernacular with a personal lexicon that divided her community into ""Singletons"" and ""Smug-marrieds."" Little surprise then that the unlikely casting of American thesp Renee Zellweger over British actresses caused a row not seen since Tom Cruise donned fangs to play the vampire Lestat. The good news is that Zellweger delivers as Bridget and her fellow actors including Hugh Grant and Colin Firth as the men she must choose between are exceptionally well cast. The bad news is that despite being edited down to a bare-bones 90-odd minutes forcing the elimination of key characters and scenes and the underdevelopment of others pic manages to feel paradoxically as dramatically flabby as the 10 pounds Bridget cannot seem to shed. Things start off promisingly with Bridget alone in her flat comically crooning along with the radio. Awash in red flannel pajamas and wine-induced haze cheerfully oblivious and singing ""All by Myself"" Zellweger breathes full-bodied life into Bridget. Opening title sequence is the movies best bit. Soon shes off to a holiday turkey-curry buffet where for the umpteenth time family friends barrage her with questions about her love life. Though her irrepressible mum (Gemma Jones) is scheming to fix her up with a childhood friend party guest and top barrister Mark Darcy (Firth) Bridget who suffers from foot-in-mouth disease botches the encounter. Needless to say it is not a love connection. Its not that Mark Darcy is so awful; its just that hes a sartorially challenged snob who loftily dismisses Bridgets attempt to make conversation. She much prefers mooning over Daniel Cleaver (Grant) her cad of a boss who has finally begun to take notice of her Ally McBeal-length skirts. After a blissful and sex-filled courtship with Daniel Bridget makes an unfortunate discovery that ends their romance. Not to worry suggest her Singleton best friends Shazza (Sally Phillips) Jude (Shirley Henderson) and Tom (James Callis) Theres life beyond Daniel. Surprisingly theres been interest from Mark Darcy whos apologized for his earlier behavior. In a thoroughly overstaged sequence that transpires at Bridgets 32nd birthday party theres a showdown between Mark and Daniel leaving Bridget in a ""Pride and Prejudice""-type dilemma of choosing between two men. Above sequence which is not in the book has the effect of visually underscoring the conflict and further delineating Marks and Daniels own bitter history but it reduces her friends to a simpering chorus. Other sequences memorable from the book are re-created with mixed success including Bridgets arrival at a ""Tarts and Vicars"" party in full Playboy bunny regalia mortified to discover the party theme had been changed and an infamous scene that finds Bridget trying to scurry up a fire pole. Zellweger is a tireless sport about all of this. And despite the initial furor over her casting her best roles (in ""Jerry Maguire"" and ""Nurse Betty"") have indicated a sweetness vulnerability and comic timing that make her perfect for Bridget. Gaining some 20 pounds the actress has transformed herself into a lumpy fleshy everywoman. Sadly Stuart Dryburghs lensing and Rachael Flemings costumes go a bit too far in making her look unattractive. As to her accent Brits may complain about its authenticity but Americans will be thoroughly convinced. Grant and Firth are impeccable. Firth whose performance as Mr. Darcy in the BBCs ""Pride and Prejudice"" was the model for Fieldings Mark Darcy brings unexpected depth to his role while Grant for once thankfully gets to play against type. And perhaps its no small coincidence that both actors are mentioned in the book. Documentary director Sharon Maguire the real-life model for Fieldings Shazza has shown an uncertain hand in her first feature. Script by Fielding Richard Curtis (""Notting Hill"" scribe) and BBC ""Pride and Prejudice"" writer Andrew Davies could have benefited from using elements of the books diary structure a framework it first adopts then jettisons inexplicably. Pic also seems to suffer in some scenes from a lack of color correction.

Comments Bridget Joness Diary Renee Zellweger adopts a plausible English accent to play the title character of Helen Fieldings popular novel a lovable nebbish who gets involved with her boss (Hugh Grant) at a London publishing house. As likable as Zellweger is I could have done without all the pushy tactics of this 2001 romantic comedy which guarantees at least one complete character reversal every half hour and a golden oldie blasting on the sound track every time your attention threatens to wander. Its so aggressive you dont even have to like it; the movie likes itself well enough for the both of you. Sharon Maguire directed a script by Fielding Andrew Davies and Richard Curtis. Colin Firth costars; with Gemma Jones and Jim Broadbent. R 92 min.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

Good By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer Friday April 13 2001 Renee Zellweger and Hugh Grant have a go at it in ""Bridget Joness Diary."" (Miramax) How does one ""critique"" a movie like ""Bridget Joness Diary"" which is essentially a call-to-arms (oops male-centric term) for anyone who has been deserted or hurt in love or anyone who has ever worried about their weight or feared that theyre doomed to a life of loneliness or listened to Madonna (I just threw that in for good measure) and read (and certainly loved) Helen Fieldings bestseller of the same name? Well? Do you play accommodating Venusian or intolerant Martian? Do you honor the good-natured cultists whod enjoy any adaptation of their beloved book? Or do you heed the appalled cries of the real cult those purists who know the book like bearded scholars of the Dead Sea Scrolls who will be mortified to see a Yank playing a quintessential Brit and who are likely to decry this adaptation (written by Fielding Richard Curtis and Andrew Davies) which slims and trims the book down to Twiggy size? Do you make fun of Renee Zellwegers ""English"" accent or pat her on the back for a good college try? I mean its almost English. Or do you just say what you think? I like the latter. As the new year begins 32-year-old Bridget (Zellweger) resolves to change her life for the better. Shes attractive reasonably successful and alone. She decides to find a man and join her ""smug-married"" friends. Almost immediately she becomes the target of roguish manager Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) who seduces her with smooth talk on e-mail and a squeeze of the bum. But also lurking in the background - and not seeming too palatable at first - is the sullen repressed Mark Darcy (Colin Firth). He does good-guy things in his job. But he seems so humorless. And Daniel is so dapper so confident. Anyone whos still wondering with whom shell find true love and happiness should definitely watch this. Okay this movie wasnt my cup of tea or glass of Chardonnay. Ive seen - and liked much better - all those English adorable-export films. I clapped for ""Four Weddings and a Funeral."" I applauded ""Notting Hill."" And although I didnt dislike ""Bridget Jones"" I felt as if I was watching ""One Wedding and a Funeral."" Especially when the movie introduced me to Bridgets insufferably cheery friends Shazza (Sally Phillips) Jude (Shirley Henderson) and Tom (James Callis) who seem to exist merely to be her support group. All three films have these wandering friends who put on supportive dinners for their romantically beleaguered friend. And all three films were written by Curtis. I can say with enthusiasm Zellweger is eminently likable in the part whether she sounds English or not. I can also say that Grant makes a first-class cad. In a movie that seems to dangerously suggest that a womans value is entirely wrapped up in the man she persuades to marry her its devilish relief to see Mr. Sorry About L.A. turning his trademark niceness into something completely scurrilous. Hes clearly having a great time. Firth is a favorite of mine. What a pity then that he has to play a one-dimensional repressed prig. You can see that theres more dimension to the actor than the role allows. All in all ""Bridget Joness Diary"" comes as a great letdown given all the anticipation that preceded its release. How can you celebrate a movie in which Zellweger doesnt soar but simply avoids disaster? I couldnt help thinking how much better this movie would have been if theyd made it 10 years ago with Julie Walters in the lead. Youd not only get an internationally known star who can ""do"" British (after all Darling she is - you know?) youd have a Bridget who could light up a whole movie.""Bridget Joness Diary"" (R 95 minutes) - Contains sexual scenes very naughty words overt sexual suggestion and a little bit of fisticuffs.

(Miramax) Say this for ""Bridget Joness Diary"" It is certainly the only movie ever made in which the heroine asks the actual Salman Rushdie where the toilets are. More shocking - he knows You could say the film runs the gamut then from highbrow to nobrow; and you could infer in the vast distance between those two opposites the presence of a life that is chaotic smart and very funny. The movie based on the famously successful novel by Helen Fielding (who wrote the screenplay with Andrew Davies and Richard Curtis) is sort of an Everysinglewomans progress through that malady known as modern life where her persistent enemies are men who wont commit friends who wont stop committing self-doubt cellulite and the ever-icky question that bedevils them all Control-top panties for the slimmer look or those thong things to go the hottie route? Bridget bless her soul gives us a peek at both. Bridget Jones early thirties gently zaftigish self-conscious highly intelligent highly human and highly mixed up works in a London publishing house where shes expected to shill for books that are idiotic and show deference to men who are even more idiotic. Meanwhile shes trying to escape the spinster trap without giving up her soul but of course she gives up her soul anyway. Played by the American actress Renee Zellweger Bridget is somewhere between lovable and annoying. Shes got one of those mushy faces hair thats not quite as cute as everybody thinks and squinty eyes. The choice of Texas-born Zellweger to play this quintessentially English heroine upset many people most of them British -- but as we all know ever since the English gave up their empire they dont count. If they want to be listened to they should take back Hong Kong India and East Africa. Zellweger assays the accent with enough aplomb to get by and she put on enough weight to suggest a real woman instead of that eternal screen goddess with a 15-year-olds perfect tawny sinewy bod. Shes not afraid to show a little avoirdupois squirting out twixt panty elastic and blouse hem not a bulge so much as just a squidge too much tum flaccid as unrisen dough. The actresss problem is that she never quite seems smart enough for Bridget an eternal wisecracker and self-deprecator who speaks in High Irony smokes too much drinks too much and lusts too much and who is secretly what might be called a romantic egoist She wants to be loved but only for the her that is not the her that someone wants her to be. Honey heres some advice Get a dog. Zellwegers apparent lack of intellectual vim may not matter much; the movie is really carried by its two male leads Hugh Grant and Colin Firth who represent the alpha and the omega of male nastiness. Bridgets problem is she cant figure out which is the alpha and which the omega. Grant plays her dashing boss Daniel Cleaver a very publishing-type guy if you know that world. This may be Grants best performance because hes not trying to be loved. Hes a cruel manipulative cad hiding behind the male gods countenance that he knows all too well. I love the way he loves himself and when he gives one of those transparently phony but effective winsome looks he is like catnip to the gals. It helps no end that Grants Daniel - and maybe Grant himself - is incredibly intelligent and quick-witted. I also liked the part where he got beaten up. Any movie in which somebody kicks the crap out of Hugh Grant is okay by me. Firth is that other male horror the inexpressive pedantic nerd who can never be wrong and never say a nice thing to anybody. Both the characters name - Mark Darcy - and the character himself are boldly stolen from ""Pride and Prejudice"" and in fact in an inside joke Firth played Jane Austens Darcy in a famous BBC version of the book where Helen Fielding fell in wuv wif him; his recycling in this version of her version of Jane Austens version is so postmodern I forgot to laugh. A human-rights lawyer who is too polite to his mother and his domineering near-girlfriend Darcy carries his emotions in a little metal tube taped somewhere you dont want to know about and nobodys getting close to that. In fact ""Bridget Joness Diary"" is at its best in observing these two male ur-types. Grants Cleaver is the man women sleep with but never marry; Firths Darcy is the man women marry but never sleep with. Or when they finally do its not with a lot of athleticism. Grant is casually fabulous and very amusing but all power to Firth the actor. Hes the compleat Darcy and he never wavers. Theres no sentimentality no flirtation with the audience no final moment of pandering to the niceness gods; hes a cold geek all the way through. You can see him simmering with rage - at Bridget for being so attractive at himself for never quite knowing what to say at both of them for being prey to such childishness at his libido for wanting and at his ego for fearing. Especially poignant are his long looks at her. You see in his eyes his yearning hunger and his fury at his own ineloquence and inability to find the will to move ahead from across the unbridgeable distance of a large room filled with happy people. Of plot a lot theres not. Bridget in an attempt to get a real life going shows up for work one day in a skirt so small a single postage stamp would be too much to send it through the mail but not too small to cover it. Naturally boss-man Cleaver notices and that romantic firestorm of the modern era flirtation and seduction by e-mail breaks out. Soon their cyberspace trysts give way to a more fleshly variety but of course Bridget is so besotted by her bosss Pepso-blast smile that she catapults into the delusion that its true love not just hot sex. Meanwhile the priggish snippy lawyer keeps running into her always a dark fury of superiority. You know where its going ye olde triangle tango. Which of these two rotters will win out for the right to ruin Bridgets life more completely? Bridgets progress is as tough as any pilgrims Shes up shes dumped into the dumps shes orgasmic shes fat shes drunk shes self-pitying shes hot shes not. She even manages in one spectacular sequence to get a job as a TV reporter and in her first report show her butt to the nation. Talk about the bums rush The movie never romanticizes her which is good; this is sort of like a grown-up version of ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" where they use the F-word in every other sentence. Rhoda was never so crude but never so funny. The director Sharon Maguire is new to features but not to Fielding; shes actually a close friend of Fieldings and the inspiration for one of Bridgets three friends. So she understands the material and lets it work without getting in the way. I have no idea what inspired Ms. Fielding other than her own life but Ill bet she went to the movies a lot The movie has a great deal of similarity to two other Hugh Grant hits though this time its Zellweger in the Grant role. Those two of course are ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and ""Notting Hill."" Same structure - the most attractive of a circle of friends yearns for freedom from it yet always returns; the friends (here played by Shirley Henderson Sally Phillips and James Callis) in turn are always there for her (or him) but everyone knows that moving on is best. So its no surprise that co-screenwriter Curtis wrote both ""Weddings"" and ""Hill."" Its a sound structure for it enables Zellweger to show both her frantic awkwardness and her tender decency. Meanwhile the boys circle about her after what the boys are always after. Bridget it turns out lives not a quiet life but quite a life.""Bridget Joness Diary"" (118 minutes) is rated R for language and sexual content.

Just often enough however this 21st century update of the ""single working girl"" is the ""too much"" that means very funny -- or v.f. as the charmingly obsessive Bridget herself might abbreviate in her best-selling memoirs. It appears that too much indeed has been made of the fact that Renee Zellweger normally a twig-thin Texan is the one who wiggles into the barely-there form-fitting miniskirt that drives Bridgets publishing-house boss mad with e-mail-stoked desire. Have no fear all you singletons and smug marrieds out there. Zellwegers posh English accent fairly trills out of her plush lips and her body though stuffed into questionable costumes and captured at unflattering angles is as plump and protruding as it needs to be. Its actually refreshing to see a character with a little flesh on her bones. Ally McBeal eat your heart out. But where the highly likable actress proves most valuable is in making us adore this insecure clumsy contradictory creature. She has us at hello or at least from the opening credits where she strikes a perfect picture of self-pity Alone in her apartment Frasier on the telly wrapped in penguin-print jammies weepily soused on wine mouthing along to All by Myself on the radio. The plot is Pride and Prejudice with extra spice. Bridget breaks the ultimate office taboo by sleeping with her boss the dashing Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant simply swell as a neer-do-well for a change). Their affair is a blissful active one but the minute she utters the L-word off he races like a scared rabbit into the arms of a skinnier paramour. Meanwhile her family keeps trying to hook her up with a rich divorced human-rights barrister Mark Darcy. At the annual post-holiday turkey curry buffet he finds her frumpy and shallow she considers him snobby and ridiculous in a Rudolph the Reindeer sweater. But they keep bumping into each other and because he is played by that very model of brooding British manhood known as Colin Firth a happy ending is guaranteed. The nonsense about Bridgets mother and her midlife meltdown was silly in the book and not much better on screen. Worse the movie sometimes mistreats Bridget nearly as badly as Daniel does. On the page the humor is wittily self-deprecating. But first-time feature director Sharon Maguires reliance on overly broad comedy threatens to turn her star into a pratfalling buffoon. But Zellweger rises above it all even as she slides down a fire pole with her G-stringed bottom exposed on national TV. Shes at her most brilliant when enduring Bridgets painful stabs at public speaking. Not only will fellow bachelorettes sympathize so will our verbally challenged prez George W. While the declaration ""I like you very much just as you are"" isnt quite as classic as ""Heres looking at you kid"" its music to the female ear in these needy neurotic times.

Starring Renee Zellweger Hugh Grant Colin Firth. Directed by Sharon Maguire. (VHS and DVD. R. 95 minutes.). ""Bridget Joness Diary"" contains a sight so shocking it might upset sensitive viewers. Its cellulite On a leading lady no less. Its but one of the let-it-all-hang-out joys of ""Bridget Jones"" the hilarious and sexy adaptation of Helen Fieldings best-seller. Renee Zellweger gives a full-bodied full-throttle performance as the weight-obsessed chain-smoking and irrepressible single woman in her 30s. Matching her comic panache are Hugh Grant as her charming but romantically toxic boss and Colin Firth as his stiff but sincere romantic rival. Zellwegers crack comic timing and enormously expressive face pre-empt the idea of any other Bridget. She embodies the daffy determination self- skewering wit and vulnerability of her character. The 20 pounds she gained for the role enhance her girlish appeal. ""Bridget Jones"" is a triumph for all involved. Screenwriters Fielding Andrew Davies and Richard Curtis have wisely pared down or excised subplots to focus on Bridgets romantic travails and career missteps. Director Sharon Maguire has crafted a production that zips along at a laugh-a-minute pace. Bridget works at a London publishing house and pines for her handsome cad of a boss Daniel (Grant). She passes time by documenting her sad-sack life in her diary (Sample entry ""Weight 140 (but post-Christmas); cigarettes 40; alcohol units 15""). Real life interferes when the boss shows interest and she succumbs to his roguish charm. Zellwegers chemistry with Grant is electric and their scenes crackle with sexuality and humor. Grant sheds his trademark stammering and fluttering in favor of an aging lotharios lived-in sexiness. He allows himself to look older onscreen and it works wonderfully for the role. Grants Daniel is witty undeniably hot and maddeningly sheepish about commitment. . -- This movie contains raw language and sexual situations.

The neurotic girl is kind clever funny competent at her job and a great friend to her fellow singletons; she also drinks too much smokes too much obsesses too much chatters too much eats junk and when it comes to men cant distinguish between trash (which in the book she dashingly calls ""emotional f--wittage"") and quality. Too smart to settle for the perks of ditzhood shes also foolish enough to regularly sabotage opportunities for romantic happiness. Shes a Jane Austen naif in a ""Sex and the City"" world. When the book came out in 1996 readers went nuts. At last an antirole model for the rest of us On the screen where Bridget Joness Diary has been adapted from Helen Fieldings hilarious best seller by documentarian and first time feature director Sharon Maguire (an old friend of the author and model for the heroines journalist pal Shazzer) Bridgets most attractive asset is that shes played by Renee Zellweger. There was a hoo and a ha when the Texas born Ms. Z was chosen over plenty of terrific local talent interested in the plum role to play a bird of such English habits (American women stopped smoking in movies ages ago - bad for the product endorsement deals babe). But Zellweger is in fact thoroughly charming and believably British in the role. Her confidence in her own flexibility as an actor has visibly grown in just a year following the great reviews she received for her performance in ""Nurse Betty"" and she glows with the pleasing fullness of the 20 pounds she so famously added for the part all angles softened. (This is not what ""fat"" looks like; this is what ripe sexy health looks like and she neednt have dropped the weight afterwards - except perhaps to eat lunch again in the demented scale obsessed town of Hollywood.) Hugh Grant is charming too luxuriating in naughtiness taking a holiday from his usual floppy velvet romantic image as Bridgets caddish boss Daniel Cleaver with whom the employee embarks on a bound for disaster affair. (""Ive got a posh voice and a bad character"" Cleaver admits with Grants full support and admiration.) Colin Firth is appealing as the decent rich upstanding Mark Darcy his participation a cunning pretzel of allusive logic Firth played Mr. Darcy in the exquisite 1995 BBC television adaptation of ""Pride and Prejudice"" the Austen masterpiece on which ""Bridget Joness Diary"" is anchored. (Jones also interviews Firth on a magazine assignment in Fieldings frustratingly weak follow up novel ""Bridget Jones The Edge of Reason."") The mess though wheres the mess? The hysteria the middle of the night jitters of loneliness? The mess of Bridgets life has been tidied neatened into little piles of mirth and gaiety. The script by the formidably bright team of Fielding Andrew Davies (another pretzel - he adapted that BBC ""Pride and Prejudice"") and Richard Curtis (""Four Weddings and a Funeral"") grins and cracks wise with pop cultural jokes and the pretty production values that made ""Four Weddings"" so appealing Bridgets idea of a cozy evening is watching ""Frasier"" on the telly in her flannel pjs and her idea of terror is a literary cocktail reception at which she has to make small talk with Salman Rushdie. (He appears as himself doing a George Plimptonesque cameo daring any ayatollah to track him down through his theatrical agent.) ""Bridget Jones"" shines with lemon scented polish and tootles along with a soundtrack that aint too proud to use Jamie ONeals cover of Eric Carmens ""All by Myself"" Aretha Franklins ""Respect"" and Chaka Khans ""Im Every Woman"" as directional signals. But without mess and agitation - without trusting viewers to withstand the sight of genuine heartache and compulsiveness and a glimpse of real self destructiveness (it neednt involve wrist slashing - a simple hint of a devil in Miss Jones will do) this great screwup of a woman - one of literatures best antidotes to self help hysteria in the 1990s - is almost indistinguishable from oh the sylphy single woman played by Ashley Judd in ""Someone Like You"" or by Gwyneth Paltrow in ""Sliding Doors"" or by Hope Davis in ""Next Stop Wonderland"" or by Ally McBeal or any sitcom sister anywhere in prime time. After Daniel Cleaver has dumped her (shes an old cow and he was looking for a new cow to filch from the psychobabble in ""Someone Like You"") Bridget throws a dinner party to celebrate her birthday. She cant cook true but her lack of skill is endearing and everyone laughs full of wine. Darcy can cook hes gorgeous and he thinks shes fab. ""To Bridget? who we love just as she is"" her friends toast in her cozy little kitchen each object in the room imported by the production designers to signify offbeat domesticity. Well of course why wouldnt they? The movie never shows us anything about Bridget thats remotely in need of psychological or physical fixing.

"Bridget Jones Diary | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; bridget-jones-diary ) Bridget Jones Diary (United Kingdom/United States 2001) A movie review by James Berardinelli Bridget Joness Diary is quite simply the finest motion picture released by Miramax Films since 1999s The Cider House Rules. Based on the novel by Helen Fielding the screenplay for Bridget Joness Diary (written by Four Weddings and a Funeral scribe Richard Curtis) successfully adapts the book into an easily-manageable 90 minute chunk while retaining much of the humor and remaining faithful to the tone. Bridget Joness Diary is smart sassy and thoroughly enjoyable and features one of the most endearing and believable characters to grace the screen this year. The film tells the story of a year in the life of an average single thirty-something British woman who armed with only her wits and charm (and a diary) goes in search of the ever-elusive Mr. Right. Unlucky-in-love Bridget (Renee Zellweger) has two candidates the fun and sexy Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) and the dour Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) whom she overhears calling her a ""verbally incontinent spinster"" when they first meet at a party. Not surprisingly she goes for Daniel but he turns out to be a less-than-perfect catch. Then just when her interest in Mark begins to emerge (following his statement that he likes her just as she is) he hooks up with man-eating lawyer Natasha (Embeth Davidtz) who is determined to marry him. Meanwhile her parents marriage is on the rocks and she embarks upon a career in television news. (The line that gets her the position ""I got fired from my last job for sleeping with my boss."") In England the casting of American Renee Zellweger was initially greeted with much resistance by the press and the public. It was argued that not only was Zellweger an American but she was too skinny to play the chubby Bridget. Well some time between casting and shooting Zellweger put on a few pounds (shes pleasingly plump - not fat by any means but certainly of Kate Winslet proportions) and worked hard to perfect a British accent (there are a few slips but theyre mercifully rare). These qualities coupled with her natural charm and screen presence make her a flawless choice for the lead. Not since her breakthrough roles in The Whole Wide World and Jerry Maguire has she given a performance of this all-around quality. Zellweger embodies Bridget and is a huge reason why the movie works. Those who have read Jane Austens Pride and Prejudice will find some familiar characters and elements in Bridget Joness Diary. It doesnt take much deduction to determine that Helen Fielding is an Austen admirer and that all of the nods to Pride and Prejudice are intentional. While it would be unfair to call Bridget Joness Diary a 20th-century re-interpretation of Pride and Prejudice there are some parallels - at least one of which the filmmakers have decided to emphasize. The casting of Colin Firth as Mark Darcy is inspired. Firth who essayed Mr. Darcy in the hugely popular 1995 BBC/Aamp;E television production of Pride and Prejudice plays this part exactly as he played the earlier role making it evident that the two Darcys are essentially the same. Hes a repressed snob who gradually unwillingly finds himself falling for the least suitable woman around him - Bridget (who upon closer examination bears a passing resemblance to Elizabeth Bennet). Hugh Grant brings all the charm he can muster to the oily role of Daniel - a man who enhances his chances with Bridget by telling a lie about Mark. Like Austens Wickham this guy is too good to believe and proceeds to prove our suspicions correct. Grant who like Firth has appeared in an Austen adaptation (Sense and Sensibility) is at home in the role. Strong supporting performances are given by Jim Broadbent and Gemma Jones as Bridgets parents. Bridget Joness Diary is filled with moments of truth and flashes of humor (sometimes the two are the same). The direction by newcomer Sharon Maguire shows the deftness of a veteran. The energy level is consistently high and the characters (especially Bridget) dont take long to endear themselves to the audience. The result is worthy of exultation especially in the bleakness of the winter/spring cinematic landscape. I smiled at the biting one-liners laughed at both the subtle and the overt comedic aspects and nodded my head in sympathy with Bridgets all-too-familiar plight - and Im a male. Imagine the female reaction. Congratulations to all involved. Bridget Joness Diary is a triumph.
