"Please Dont Be Back The Terrible Terminator Genisys Barely Dents an Above-Average Summer << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Please Dont Be Back The Terrible Terminator Genisys Barely Dents an Above-Average Summer Paramount Pictures Movies July 7 2015 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print After the July 4th weekend theres often some fretting over how bad things are. Its the usual crop of worries Were up to our masks in superhero movies. Nothings original. Where are the new young stars? Technically those concerns have been valid again this year but overall this has been a well-above-average first half of summer. Theres been only a sparing helping of Marvel-ness and the Marvel-ness we got -- Avengers Age of Ultron -- seemed built to put everything else out of your memory.1 Meanwhile 2015 might be the high-water mark for Hollywood sequels and reboots -- by volume yes but also by quality from Furious 7 to Magic Mike XXL. More Terminator Genisys Thought Experiment What If Terminator Genisys Didnt Flop?  The Term-ies Handing Out Awards for the Most Confusing Film Franchise in American History Weekend Box Office Winners amp; Losers Killer Robots Abs Disappoint The movies have been richer weirder and more ambitious than through any June I can remember. Some have come from the independent galaxy and represent a varying range of ideas -- Results The Tribe The Wolfpack A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence Me and Earl and the Dying Girl Amy Dope and What Happened Miss Simone? Some like Mad Max Fury Road Inside Out and Spy represent an artisanal strain of Hollywood production. Some like San Andreas and Jurassic World hit the bulls-eye of good-dumb summer crap. Even the one lousy movie in that bunch -- Dope which has been luring satisfied audiences since it opened three weeks ago -- is at least a moviegoing experience. The experience is all you want sometimes and when you dont get it -- when Entourage or Ted 2 rubs your face in a bad time -- youre doubly insulted. Terminator Genisys is the worst of all possible worlds. Its neither a surprising work of pop art nor an entertaining piece of crap. (And forget about explaining that spelling to a nosy 6-year-old.) Its awful in a way that makes you not even feel entitled to a refund. With Furious Thirty-Seven or another Melissa McCarthy comedy you can ask ""Who could blame the studios for trying again?"" But Im going to go ahead and presume that most of us are all set with this franchise which began with James Camerons sweaty 1984 original and crested with 1991s sequel Terminator 2 Judgment Day. Until this fifth installment I thought things couldnt get sadder than Claire Danes screaming ""Oh my god"" as Kristanna Loken attacked the roof of a speeding car in 2003s Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines. Oops. This time the old characters have been reimagined with different less ferocious actors. Arnold Schwarzeneggers Terminator has been hanging around in 1984 serving as the bodyguard for Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke) the mother of the savior of mankind. Shes hip to the pending Armageddon and is armed and ready for the return from the future of Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) whos come back from the original movie to protect Sarah from Schwarzeneggers killing machine. He has volunteered do so against the wishes of Sarahs son John (Jason Clarke) and is shocked to discover that his future baby mama is a soldier in the revolution against the corporate evil Skynet. The writing obviates any need to further set up the action Part of what makes Terminator Genisys so pitiful as an evening out is that all the actors do over and over again is tell us why theyre in a particular scene and why the movie exists. Theres a way the explication of this legend couldve been turned in on itself as a joke. But this movie doesnt appear to know what comedy is. It could have expanded to take in the other movies and previous stars but theres no ambition at work here. Officially Courtney does the narration (""I was born after Judgment Day into a broken world ruled by machines""). But explication duties fall to everyone the way they do in a Bertold Brecht production except ""explication"" here involves such goodies as ""The boy is an alternate-timeline version of you"" ""We dont know what the hell it is"" and ""You need a CPU from the future to make it run."" I saw this movie less than a week ago and I cant remember what ""it"" actually is. But it might as well be the film itself. Eventually things get so bad that J.K. Simmonss midpoint arrival as a dried-up detective trying to do more explaining of the plot to other less smart cops is just another excuse to put a popcorn bucket over your head. Whats really wrong with this movie? How can Jurassic World get away with being derivative and phony and also full of actors speaking mouthfuls of exposition and this movie cant? For one thing most of Jurassic World takes place during the day in scenic locales. The pair of night sequences bring the kick of legitimate danger. Nearly all of Genisys (that name) is set in Los Angeles at night and the feeling is always that theyre hiding something like wires glue and duct tape. Its available in 3-D but in 2-D things look murky. This isnt true of Camerons original where the dark itself is a force of possibility where anything is liable to appear in underlit corridors alleyways and waiting rooms. Cameron can conjure dread. He appears to have had nothing to do with this movie which the longtime TV director Alan Taylor helmed and whose script is credited to Laeta Kalogridis and Patrick Lussier. These people are continuing Camerons original thread but have lost most of the originals cyberpunk-Orwellian media premonitions. You get the sense that all the talking the characters are doing is as much to keep the filmmakers oriented as it is to orient anybody in the audience born like Kyle after Terminator 2. That of course is forgivable but you dont watch this movie convinced the people in it know how to read whats on the page. This is easily the worst-cast movie of the summer. Emilia Clarke Jason Clarke and Courtney all use stiff American accents (the men are Australian; shes from England). Jason Clarke at least seems like hes trying to have fun with his but these arent people you want to watch save or destroy the world. They lack the stature and gonzo seriousness of a Linda Hamilton who in the second movie made Sarah Connor mythological. Emilia Clarke away from her platinum-blond Game of Thrones getup is a damp presence who speaks her lines too quickly. You understand why theyre here. What do they have to lose? But why Schwarzenegger keeps returning to this part is baffling. It seemed like the whole point of Sylvester Stallones Expendables movies was that the movies gallery of beached action heroes were content to remain in that gassy retirement village. But the defensive humorlessness of The Expendables turned out to be a warning that Stallone amp; Co. believe theyre here to stay like unwelcome houseguests. Schwarzenegger is 67 and as incapable of letting go of his iconic parts as Stallone is. Its pathetic. But with Stallone every Rocky or Rambo or knockoff of either seems to invigorate him. Theres no pleasure that comes off of Schwarzenegger in this role not anymore. In 1991 near the height of his stardom he could mix menace and arch comedy into a screen style. Its a mix that helped make him an elected official. Moviewise everything since he left office has been a kind of disgrace. But in something like last years double- or triple-cross heist thriller Sabotage or this years meek zombie drama Maggie hes searching for another gear. The ads promise that a high point of Genisys will be the sight of Schwarzenegger squaring off against the version of himself that appeared in the original movie. Its just his young face superimposed on a hulking body double. The two slabs of Arnold push each other around a couple of times. But its not the time-bending fun that the effects team wants it to be. Their brawls are scary the way natural disasters are. Youre not at a science fiction action-thriller by that point. Youre watching a rockslide. The onslaught resumes in a couple of weeks with Ant-Man and a relaunching of Fantastic Four.

To prevent this Connor sends his lieutenant Kyle Reese back to 1984 to protect his mother Sarah from the Terminator who has been sent to assassinate her. But Reeses presence in 1984 alters space-time thus creating a whole new timeline that leads to among other things new fates for John Connor new fates for the Terminator and new fates for Sarah--who unlike the Sarah of the original Terminator is now prepared for Reeses arrival. It also leads to Arnold Schwarzenegger playing the role of an aged T-800.Related Story Have Movies Reached Peak Reboot With Terminator Genisys? ""The future is not set"" indeed. We are not meant to think too hard about any of this but instead to subject it to the laconic demands of the time-travel-action-movie suspended disbelief. Which is made extra clear by the films breezy reliance on ""quantum fields"" and ""nexus points"" (multiple versions the film explains of ""a point so significant it gives birth to two futures"") and other soothingly Einsteinian callbacks to explain its cosmology. At one point--decidedly not a nexus point--Reese (Jai Courtney) as the films physics are being explained to him remarks that the temporal acrobatics involved in his own multi-futured plot line are ""making his brain hurt."" This is a way of letting the character the audience and the movie off the hook all at the same time.It isnt Terminator Genisys fault really that its plot is so absurd. The plot of every Terminator sequel has been absurd. And thats because the plot of The Terminator itself (the future comes to the past to change the future but that means the past is changed so the future is changed so what even is the future but anyway Arnold Schwarzenegger) was absurd. The disbelief-suspension audiences are meant to undergo as they put on their 3D glasses for this version of the Connor saga is seen generously one way the sequel (or prequel? what even is the future anyway) pays homage to the original.What made The Terminator a classic though--and what gave Terminator 2 Judgment Day its entry into the small pantheon of Sequels That Are Actually Good--was the fact that via their silly plots these films were making arguments about time and fate and the things humans owe to our families and our futures. They were deeply concerned about the monopolistic tendencies of the technologies of their times--artificial intelligences computer networks--and their ability not just to expand human potential but to undermine it. Their stakes were epic but also powerfully microcosmic. Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke) in addition to all the heroines journey stuff she undertook in her fight for and against cyborgian assassins was a full fleshed-out character. So was Kyle Reese. So in his way was Arnold the eponymous Terminator and quintessential anti-hero.Terminator Genisys however has none of the stakes and none of the moral preoccupations of its predecessors. Movies that are about robots will always on some level be about what it means to be human but the considerations here arent more than skin (or you know fake cyborg skin) deep. The latest Terminator is a franchise film in the most cynical sense of that term but also in the most serviceable. There are indeed shape-shifting man-machines to be had here. There are indeed extremely faithful scene recreations of the original--Arnold youthful and nude--accomplished through slick CGI. There are indeed fight scenes--involving among other conveyances buses and helicopters--that are delightful in their defiance of the laws of physics. There is indeed ""come with me if you want to live."" There is indeed a callback to ""Ill be back"" (the equally deadpanned ""Ill be there""). There is indeed a love story. Kind of.Terminator Genisys however has none of the stakes and none of the moral preoccupations of its predecessors.There are also references to other disbelief-suspending action movies. Theres the leader-making-an-inspirational-speech-to-his-troops-about-their-upcoming-battle-to-save-the-world (Independence Day) and the vehicle hanging precariously over a ledge (Jurassic Park The Lost World) and the woman-whose-nakedness-is-portrayed-by-way-of-shadows (pretty much every James Bond opener ever) and the same woman--a woman whose salvation the entire plot of the movie spins around--insisting with high indignation ""I dont need saving."" Theres also a lot of awkwardly inserted exposition (""If we die tonight humanity dies with us"") and even more awkwardly inserted dialogue. (""We blow it the hell up?"" ones asks. ""We blow it the hell up"" the other replies.)Its telling that the person who steals scenes again and again--they are ripe for the stealing--is not actually a person. Its the T-800 who has aged (cyborg skin gets old too Sarah explains to Kyle) and whose programming has kept him locked in Sarah-protection-mode. So the machine has become a kind of father figure to Sarah--""Pops"" she calls him--and the films moments of levity revolve around Pops uncanny resemblance to middle-aged men of a more human strain. (""I read about this"" he remarks as he assembles some cyborg-fighting munitions ""on guns-and-ammo-dot-com""). The dad-bodded man-machine insists again and again ""Im old not obsolete."" In the context of a reboot that both repeats and rejects the past however his protests are not convincing.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Theres something not quite natural about her self-presentation. Shes not stilted exactly. But she can come across as too cautious too reserved too conscious of other peoples eyes upon her. But lets face it as the lead-in to Hillarys big nominating speech a little bit of boring was called for. Unlike some of this conventions high-wattage speakers there was zero chance Chelsea was going to upstage Hillary with a barnburner or tear-jerker. Chelsea wasnt there to pump up the crowd. Her role was to comfort to explain to cajole with an eye toward giving Americans a glimpse of her mothers softer side. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion. Continue Reading Channel 4 The Prescience of Brass Eye 15 Years Later David Sims Chris Morriss brutal satire aired its last and most controversial episode in 2001 but its skewering of the news media feels more relevant than ever. A sex offender is thrown in the stocks presented with a small child and asked if he wants to molest him. A mob of protestors is thrown a ""dummy full of guts"" that is stomped to pieces within seconds. A radio host insists that pedophiles have ""more genes in common with crabs"" than the rest of humanity insisting ""Theres no real evidence for [that] but it is scientific fact."" Its hard to pinpoint the most cringe-inducing moment on ""Paedogeddon"" a special episode of the British TV satire Brass Eye. But 15 years after the episode aired it remains a totemic terrifying satirical vision. Few comedies since have dared to cross the boundaries of taste with such impunity. ""Paedogeddon"" aired in the U.K. in the summer of 2001 a year after the murder of a young girl had sparked national hysteria over the countrys sex-offender registry. Britains most-read newspaper led a campaign to publish the names and locations of all 110000 convicted sex offenders prompting a riot in which an angry mob ransacked the home of an ex-con. Brass Eye a parody of a 60 Minutes-like newsmagazine show had been dormant after airing one season in the UK in 1997. But it returned four years later for this surprise broadcast one that saw its furious (fictional) anchors barking from a dark studio about the plague of seemingly super-powered child molesters stalking the nation holding a funhouse mirror up to the climate of paranoia and fear that had built up around the country. It was a bold wildly insensitive piece of comedy but one that captured the growing madness of the 24-hour news media and foreshadowed some uglier aspects of its future.

Almost everyone has something they want to change about their personality. In 2014 a study that traced peoples goals for personality change found that the vast majority of its subjects wanted to be more extraverted agreeable emotionally stable and open to new experiences. A whopping 97 percent said they wished they were more conscientious. These desires appeared to be rooted in dissatisfaction. People wanted to become more extraverted if they werent happy with their sex lives hobbies or friendships. They wanted to become more conscientious if they were displeased with their finances or schoolwork. The findings reflect the social psychologist Roy Baumeisters notion of ""crystallization of discontent"" Once people begin to recognize larger patterns of shortcomings in their lives he contends they may reshuffle their core values and priorities to justify improving things.

Now 66 Schwarzenegger easily brings the same mix of menace power robotic regurgitation and most importantly humor that he brought to the first two films in the series.Although all the series most core elements remain intact -- Sarah and John Connor Kyle Reese assorted robot killing machines from the future and of course an impending doomsday -- here theyve been thrown into a time travel blender by screenwriters Laeta Kalogridis and Patrick Lussier. This does wonders for the action and the characters but forces endless explanations that may or may not make much sense into the transitional dialogue.Luckily director Alan Taylor (a veteran of ""Game of Thrones"" ""Mad Men"" and ""The Sopranos"") moves things along at a brisk pace and his characters have the convenience of feeling both familiar and brand-new. At this point these are reborn film legends were watching.It begins in the future after the robots have killed most of mankind. The resistance leader John Connor (Jason Clarke) sends his faithful lieutenant Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) back in time to rescue his mother Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke ""Game of Thrones"") from a Terminator (an assassin robot wrapped in human skin) that has also been sent back to kill her.So far so familiar. But a disruption in the time travel transmission throws everything out of whack. As Reese soon discovers Sarah Connor is not the innocent waitress he was expecting but instead a proto-resistance soldier. And shes been raised by an aging Terminator she calls Pops (Schwarzenegger) since she was 9.Emilia Clarke as Sarah Connor in ""Terminator Genisys."" (Photo Melinda Sue Gordon / Paramount)After cleaning up some bad Terminator business in the 80s Sarah and Reese realize the Doomsday date has been moved up to 2017. So after a bundle of tech talk from Pops they leap ahead via time machine (Pops takes the old-fashioned way aging and collecting firepower over the years). When they all meet up together again its time to take down the Genisys system which will spell mankinds doom.Only one complication; John Connor is also waiting for them in 2017. Its a family reunion and you know how awkward those can be.""Terminator Genisys"" is filled with references to the first two films from a group of punks one newly arrived Terminator encounters to a liquid metal T-1000 to a bleary old cop (J.K. Simmons) who remembers Sarah and Pops from his early days. And as in ""Terminator 2 Judgment Day"" Schwarzenegger is given ample opportunity to awkwardly humanize Pops while around Sarah and Reese. His forced smile here is one of the films nay the years high points.Yes the gobbledygook does build up and its probably best left to some grad student in film studies to figure out if all the time travel crisscrossing makes any sense. The point here is the momentum the epic battles and stunts the sheer blazing size of it all and that goofy smile.

Comments click to enlarge Terminator Genisys An IMAX 3D Experience Video Rated PG-13  126 minutes  2015 For this fifth installment of the Terminator movie franchise screenwriters Laeta Kalogridis and Patrick Lussier pile on so many pulpy sci-fi conceits--involving time travel alternate realities and the end of civilization--that you might be carried along by the batty excess. Arnold Schwarzeneggers hulking cyborg serves as father figure to two time-traveling rebels (the mannequin-like Jai Courtney and Emilia Clarke) out to stop a computer operating system from wiping out much of the human race. J.K. Simmons is the comic-relief-cum-audience-surrogate a bewildered police detective who makes a fool of himself whenever he tries to explain whats going on. Director Alan Taylor (Thor The Dark World) maintains an agreeably tongue-in-cheek tone though his visual style is pedestrian.

The result looks like oh I dunno a 67-year-old skinjacket sagging off the skull-plate of an outdated T-800 Terminator. It strives mightily to make up what it lacks in humanity (leads Jai Courtney and Emilia Clarke are almost as mechanical as the actual robots) with jokes bad rom-com dynamics and a great deal of punching and shooting. Theres some nifty time-travel talk some brief bits about fate vs. freedom and a half-hearted attempt to connect the danger of anti-human AI to our increased entanglement with technology. But the film knows that what its really selling is nostalgia for Arnolds first gigantic appearance; for the liquid-metal menace of Terminator 2s T-1000; for the time-loop love of Sarah and Reese. Everything else is talking and explosions. With J.K. Simmons as welcome underplayed comic relief. 2015. -- Matthew Lickona This movie is not currently in theaters.

"Terminator Genisys brings back Ah-nold review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesTerminator Genisys brings back Ah-nold review The only one having a good time in Terminator Genisys is Arnold Schwarzenegger who grins like a Cheshire cyborg in this fifth instalment of The Terminator franchise. By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. July 2 2015Terminator GenisysStarring Arnold Schwarzenegger Jason Clarke Emilia Clarke Jai Courtney Byung-hun Lee and J.K. Simmons. Directed by Alan Taylor. At GTA theatres. 125 minutes. 14AThe most quotable line in Terminator Genisys is the returning Arnold Schwarzeneggers retort ""Im old not obsolete.""The most appropriate one though is this shout by another character ""Are you kidding me?""Article Continued BelowThis latter exclamation will resonate with fans of The Terminator saga now making its fifth take on sci-fi survivalism who are confronted with head-slapping timeline and story changes. Emilia Clarke is the latest actress to play Sarah Connor.Arnold Schwarzenegger reprises his title role in Terminator Genisys.Director Alan Taylor (Thor The Dark World) and screenwriters Laeta Kalorgridis (Avatar) and Patrick Lussier (Drive Angry) pay due homage to the first three Terminator films delivering the CGI-enhanced sight of Ah-nolds T-800 cyborg in three different eras right back to 1984. (The Schwarzenegger-free fourth film Terminator Salvation is as forgotten as its title punctuation.)No problem so far. But the T-brains also trample on key aspects of the humans versus machines narrative introducing alternate histories that are explained away as ""nexus points"" of disrupted lives.The ""Judgment Day"" apocalypse by diabolical computer network Skynet in James Camerons T2 (still the best of the five films) is bumped from 1997 to 2017 all the better to fit the revised time-travelling tale that stretches beyond 2029. Schwarzeneggers killer Terminator has been rebooted into a teddy bear-toting parental figure with grey hair and answering to ""Pops.""The changes arent terrible per se because the franchise hasnt exactly been a model of consistency. But everything unfolds with the grim solemnity of a tax audit albeit an audit accompanied by car chases pursuing liquid metal men (T-1000 is also back played by Byung-hun Lee) and explosions (what the Golden Gate Bridge gets smashed again?)There are new faces and character arcs for major supporting characters Antimachine matriarch Sarah Connor (Games of Thrones Emilia Clarke) her resistance-leading son John (Jason Clarke) and his loyal lieutenant Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) all played with dour authority by capable actors. The only one really having a good time is Schwarzenegger who grins like a Cheshire cyborg even when nothings funny least of all the impending destruction of humanity. Hes always had a problem with empathy.But TerminatorGenisys has a couple of other things going for it besides happy cat Schwarzenegger. The plot threat about people potentially sealing their Skynet fate by voluntarily downloading Genisys the ""ultimate killer app"" actually makes wicked sense.And Sarah Connors command ""Come with me if you want to live"" not only makes a great gender-flipping salute to T2 it also qualifies as the years best double entendre.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Photo Paramount Pictures The nasty reviews for the fifth Terminator film Terminator Genisys are well earned -- but as lousy as the movie is I must speak up for its makers valiant attempt to make something old look new and also old ... and new. Its a vexing problem for a system that relies on sequels ""franchises"" ""tentpoles"" etc. You see studios havent had much luck remaking sci-fi blockbusters like Total Recall and RoboCop from scratch but at the same time they know it wont work simply to exhume long-in-the-tooth original casts and try to squeeze juice from premises wrung dry. So theyve pushed filmmakers to do something genuinely (if inadvertently) postmodern invent ""alternate timelines"" that mix old and new -- with winks to the millions of moviegoers who get the in-jokes. The current ultra-blah Star Trek cycle arrived in the form of a dialogue with the original the characters destinies (and in some cases their very characters) having been changed by a wayward time-traveler. The new X-Men saga is a mishmash of resurrected oldsters and hot younguns. NowA Terminator Genisys takes an already-convoluted premise and convolutes it even further to the point where even Marty McFly and Doc would cry ""Stop No more twists"" Terminator Genisys begins with the event that initiated James Camerons 1984 The Terminator but that the audience only heard about After humans under the command of rebel leader John Connor (played here by Jason Clarke) finally defeat the machines that have exterminated much of humankind the machines decide -- its their Hail Mary pass -- to send a robot in the form of Arnold Schwarzenegger back in time to kill Johns waitress mother Sarah (now Emilia Clarke of Game of Thrones) so that John wont be born. John in turn gets ahold of the time machine and sends his pal Kyle (now Jai Courtney) back to save Sarah as well as get her pregnant with ... him. Think how hard it must have been for the screenwriters (Laeta Kalogridis and Patrick Lussier are credited) to build on something already so wobbly -- and then keep piling on the absurdities. In Terminator Genisys Kyle arrives in 84 to find that Sarah is already a hardened warrior and that an old terminator played by Schwarzenegger is protecting her from the original terminator played by a digital facsimile of Schwarzenegger. (The digitizers have nailed the young Arnolds Teutonic smirk so well that I felt sorry for the old Arnold.) The past having been changed the future becomes a proverbial open book. Why in this timeline John himself could be a terminator in league with the machines and Sarah could regard the old terminator as a father figure and call him Pops. Ha Im just kidding. Or maybe Im not. You should hope I am. There is one clever modern angle concocted for a film in which ""judgment day"" is set for 2017. The machines that seek to vanquish humans have an easier time when humans are already virtual slaves to their cell phones tablets and other forms of cyberconnection. But dont expect Her-level satire Terminator Genisys is mostly CGI-heavy car chases and scenes of terminators (several levels of them) getting disintegrated putting themselves back together and getting disintegrated again the physics so wobbly that its tough to know when a machine is truly dead and gone. The re-castings dont help. Pretty and feisty as Emilia Clarke is no one can replace -- be still my heart -- Linda Hamilton and certainly not with dialogue this clunky. The Terminators Kyle Michael Biehn was skinny bright-eyed and very sweet so its a shock to see him played as a dull-witted meathead. I dont blame Courtney though He didnt cast himself. And I dont think even Biehn could have sold these terrible quips variations of ""I didnt sign up for this"" or barbs aimed at the terminator for getting too techie about techie stuff. In a typical exchange Sarah says not to insult Pops because he has feelings; Kyle says he cant have feelings hes a machine; and ""Pops"" stares stupidly ahead in a way that makes you think He does so have feelings I wish Schwarzeneggers performance was a notch above listless camp but he certainly does make you feel his sadness at aging. This terminators big line (apart from ""Ill be back"") is that hes ""old not obsolete"" but were pretty close to replacing him altogether with CGI. Though his haggard visage is explained by the revelation that terminator skin ages just like human skin no one mentions its ability to settle into a paunch. Among the odder things about Terminator Genisys is the public seal of approval it got from James Cameron who lost control of these characters after Terminator 2 Judgment DayA -- and the judgment day that was his first divorce settlement. But its easy to see why this installment floated his boat. Its sentimental in a way that the chilly third and fourth Terminator movies werent. Even if the filmmakers rewrite ""the future"" they genuflect towards the past. It doesnt jell though and the movies philosophical message is especially grating. The theme of Terminator Genisys is fate (as dictated by the killer machines) versus the freedom to choose the life one wants (the rallying cry for Sarah Connor). But all I could think as I watched was that this weird old-new Terminator movie was not the upshot of an artists free will but of the Hollywood Machine that dictates all. Cry freedom all you want Sarah but your fate is to face more terminators. The future is all sequels.

Wednesday July 1 2015 at 107 p.m. By Amy Nicholson Arnold Schwarzenegger is back in Terminator Genisys. Photo by Melinda Sue Gordon A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Five films into the franchise Terminator Genisys feels like a VHS cassette thats been rewound and recorded over for 21 years. Director Alan Taylor (of the unmemorable Thor The Dark World) gives us images -- a thumbs-up an abandoned factory a liquid-metal cop smashing through the windshield of a car -- that cut through the CGI like scratches on the tape. Genisys is haunted by ghosts of old movies a cyborg whose entire DNA is deja vu.Time is meaningless. Judgment Day has rained nuclear hellfire in 1997 2003 or 2017 numbers intoned with the transient gravitas of Powerball winners. When Arnold Schwarzenegger says ""Ill be back"" the line echoes in the brain. Is this 1984 or 1991 or 2015? Or have we stumbled into the alt-worlds of Total Recall Last Action Hero or Expendables 2 where he also grunted his catchphrase or one of Arnies gubernatorial stump speeches -- from a period that now four years after he left office feels as fictional as his films?Film Details Terminator Genisys RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time125 min. More Info Trailer At least Schwarzeneggers consistent. Sarah Connor has been played by two actors Kyle Reese by three and John Connor by four and the screenwriting teams efforts to get all of the leads in the same room suggest the bittersweet exhaustion of a Van Halen tour. But hey can we really blame them? Were the ticket buyers who keep rewarding Hagar and Schwarzenegger for parroting their greatest hits.Genisys boots up in 2029 a generation after the robot rebellion where scarred rebel leader John Connor (Jason Clarke) leads a final assault against Skynet. Those of you with flowcharts will recall thats the year when Connor sent his young foot soldier Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) back to 1984 to rescue and impregnate his mother Sarah. ""Shes a waitress"" Connor explains. Blurts Reese ""A what?"" Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat. Sep. 10 1200pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On the CW Tickets Sat.

Sep. 13 600pm Were on the other side of the time machine watching a scene James Cameron figured was unnecessary. (Side note Wanna really feel old? 1984 the start of the Terminator series is twice as many years away from the present as its postapocalypse 2029.) But when Reese lands in punk 80s L.A. hes greeted by one thing we expect a young naked Arnold recapturing the physical perfection that first got him cast as a computer man now with computer help -- once he was the special effect. And then comes one thing we arent expecting a warrior Sarah Connor who in this timeline has been waiting for his arrival since 1973. And yeah she already knows theyve gotta mate like racehorses to save humankind.This Sarah (Game of Thrones Emilia Clarke) has a sweet-looking candy-cartoon face but the wrong kind of feminist spunk. She takes offense when Reese unlocks her handcuffs when earlier iterations would have tersely nodded their thanks and grabbed a gun. Sarah looks Reese over and sighs ""Youre not what I expected"" as though this is a disappointing inter-dimensional blind date. Still shes got a point -- Courtney is a buffed-up cuckoo-for-Crossfit version of Michael Biehns original savior. That makes sense in a sequel where everything is supersized. Genisys is all bullets and bombs action without pause as though if the ride stops the whole thing will collapse under its own weight.Genisys starts with a mystifying war montage where we cant decipher whether Reese and John Connor are in peril or showing off their highlight reel. Then it maintains that furious confusion. Everyone is shooting and punching but no one knows how or why or even what year they should time-travel to next. Audiences will have seen five of these movies and might be just as disoriented -- whatever happened in Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines seems to have never happened at all. Sorry lady Terminatrix Kristanna Loken youve been written over with a new death model a human-Skynet hybrid made of liquid sand.The T-3000 has a fragmented gritty cool. Im still partial to the shiny stabby T-1000 with its limbs like razors and its face as blank as a fighting cock. Still the most clever thing Taylor and the screenwriters have concocted is an excuse to rehire Arnie as-is wrinkles and all. In this parallel universe Sarah Connor has been palling around with his T-800 since the summer she turned 9. She calls him Pops and his skin it turns out can age.Apparently his sense of humor also has developed. When Reese strips naked again -- no wonder Courtney felt pressured to hit the gym -- Schwarzenegger gives the tiniest eye-flick south before he grunts hes ""seen little to indicate"" this future-dude is a good match for his daughter. Reese needles him with ""Ive never seen an old Terminator before"" and Arnie counters with his new catchphrase ""Im not old Im obsolete.""Of course the whole motivation behind Genisys is to prove that nothing is obsolete not 67-year-old movie stars not 31-year-old sagas and certainly not mankinds perpetual paranoia about the end of the world. (Although with last weeks news that scientists have concluded Earth has begun its sixth mass extinction -- the fifth one was the dinosaurs -- we probably dont need robots to kill the planet.)""If there was another way I would have taken it"" John Connor says of his war against the machines. I have no doubt there is another way -- and that screenwriters are rewinding the VHS tape for another sequel. (An end-credits scene suggests as much.) When youve been narrowly saving the world for three decades whats the rush? As John says to an underling ""What do we want?"" ""Time travel."" ""And when do we want it?""

He looks approximately like the old (i.e. young) Ahh-nold and not so much like the leather-jacketed antihero of Camerons first film as the bulging sleek poofily coiffed bodybuilder of ""Stay Hungry"" and ""Pumping Iron."" Or rather he looks like a model of the young Arnold sculpted in plasticine and brought to life which serves as a decent analogy for this entire movie a confusing and expensive jumble of recycled parts.Its hard to say whether that spectral visitation from a lost pop-culture icon is more wistful or more creepy especially set against the wizened weatherbeaten and visibly smaller Schwarzenegger we see later in the film. If were time-traveling to L.A. in 84 I dont want to watch Arnold beat up ""punk rockers"" (who look to be about 38 years old) in Griffith Park I want to wander off that hilltop and go see whos playing at the Whisky that night or visit the now-vanished Tower Records on Hollywood Boulevard. Not to be of course but the attraction of ""Terminator Genisys"" (which was directed by TV veteran Alan Taylor from a screenplay by Laeta Kalogridis and Patrick Lussier) lies in the fact that it conjures up associations that are more powerful than the movie itself.Taylor spreads elaborate action set-pieces throughout the film at appropriate intervals as dictated by the Nolan-Bay law of current Hollywood cinema It isnt a real movie unless at least one American city is entirely destroyed. These are competently executed but often feel like digital copies of scenes delivered more effectively in other films. If you want pure mayhem ""San Andreas"" and ""Godzilla"" and ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" and even the crack overdose of Bays next-to-last ""Transformers"" movie are better choices. You can only blow up the Golden Gate Bridge so many times before we just stop noticing or caring; its like listening to your right-wing uncle raging about Hillary Clinton. In fact the ultra-tangled plotline of ""Terminator Genisys"" makes the rhythm of the action beats especially weird; we see the entire world nuked into rubble by the machine overlords really early in the movie which makes it hard to get excited about a few buildings falling down later on.You would need some kind of flowchart to make sense of who is good and whos evil in the competing timelines of Kalogridis and Lussiers screenplay but I genuinely dont think its worth it. Kyle Reese (played by aspiring Aussie hunk-star Jai Courtney) the purported hero of this movie is an idiot in all possible universes and if there are fans out there who genuinely care about the internal machinery of the ""Terminator"" franchise theyre going to wish they could forget the role this profoundly irritating dude plays in the story. That is - yeesh -- in this particular telling of the story in which Kyle gets sent back in time by John Connor (Jason Clarke) leader of the anti-machine resistance to save Johns mom Sarah (the character formerly played by Linda Hamilton among others and here by British actress Emilia Clarke) from the killer cyborgs only to discover that the timeline has been altered and Sarah already knows all this stuff and stop me if youve heard this one before.But the point of all the doleful pinballing back and forth between 2029 and 1984 and 2017 in ""Genisys"" (a visit to 1997 is threatened but sadly does not occur) if ""point"" is the right word is not the nonsensical narrative but the governing mood of intermingled nostalgia for the lost past and the lost future. Or the governating mood shall we say of pseudo-Proustian elegy and celebration for the 67-year-old retired Republican politician who is the real main attraction. Age and apparent cosmetic surgery havent improved Schwarzeneggers acting and his physical presence has diminished. But he has learned how to extract maximum impact from doing nothing and of course this character (in the quasi-present of 2017) has lived among human beings for 30 years without being one of them. You Might Also Like There are flashes of late Clint Eastwood or Richard Gere performances in Schwarzeneggers better moments; hes a lonely old cyborg lost in the 21st century a stoical working-class dude with a panel truck who gets the shakes sometimes but can still take a punch. In this particular timeline he raised Sarah from the age of 9 robotic single-dad style and she calls him Pops. ""Old but not obsolete"" Pops growls at Kyle who mistrusts him and is unhappy that Sarah is full of spunk and sass and knows how to handle automatic weapons instead of an ignorant and fragile flower. Feminist attitudes at least among men seem to have been wiped out by the rise of the machines - and dont say that Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh didnt see that comingTheres a plot twist involving Kyle and Sarahs unexpected 21st-century encounter with John Connor that Im not supposed to tell you about even though Paramount Pictures delivered a massive spoiler in a trailer that has now been viewed by millions. Lets just observe that Jason Clarke can never play a character who is not tormented especially not after waterboarding that guy in ""Zero Dark Thirty"" and add that Oscar winner J.K. Simmons gets a nice scene or two as an L.A. cop turned conspiracy theorist whos on the time-travelers trail. While the movie addresses the fact that the adult Kyle who went back to 1984 and then forward to 2017 now intersects with a version of himself at age 13 or so no one ever mentions the possibility that Clarkes 20-something time-traveling Sarah Connor might run into her ""real"" counterpart who by my count would be 53 years old. Because thats disturbing and not all that hot am I right? In the timeline of ""Terminator Genisys"" the 1997 nuclear disaster of the first ""Terminator"" franchise has been replaced by a killer app ha ha. Except no Im not kidding In the near future some demonic machine-enslaved blend of Apple Google Microsoft and the NSA will link your car to your washing machine to your phone to your brain and thats all she wrote. Its hard to outline all the ways in which thats a dopey version of apocalypse not to mention one already left behind by reality and not likely to be undone by a trio of numbskulls from the past and/or the future.Along the way to uploading ourselves into eternity we watch Schwarzenegger and his stunt doubles get flung through windows doors walls and railings by a succession of newer tougher and more evolved Terminators. Its repetitious and even a little upsetting. What do we want from this guy after all this time? And what does he want from us? One could say that he tried to save the Republican Party from itself which was a quixotic endeavor to be sure. He returned from that misadventure - he kept promising us hed be back - and has now rejoined the struggle to save the human race from robot genocide. That probably wont work either but its less obviously doomed and foolish. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

It is mechanical in the worst way.  | 1/2 out of 4 stars By Colin Covert Star Tribune July 1 2015 -- 1129am Melinda Sue Gordon Paramount Pictures Series T-800 Robot appears in ""Terminator Genisys"" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint How is ""Terminator Genisys"" different from Elon Musks rocket? At least the rocket got off the ground before exploding. Melissa Sue Gordon Paramount Pictures Arnold Schwarzenegger returns as the Terminator. James Camerons two original ""Terminator"" blockbusters are authentic pop art masterworks. Stunningly visualized memorably cast and crammed with nightmarish sci-fi noir they were work by a director in rapturous love with the pieces of art he made. Capable of freaking out people even decades later they are invulnerable to the gigantic corporate money-making enterprise that swallowed the story rights in the 1990s. Thankfully they have little bearing on the subsequent follow-up films the aggravating new entry least of all. While ""Jurassic World"" worked as a love letter to warmly remembered hits of the past and ""Mad Max Fury Road"" even better the latest Terminator film feels like an essay of high school quality. It is mechanical in the worst way. Opening with the standard post-nuclear setup it shows humanitys decimated survivors once again blitzkrieged by the Skynet artificial intelligence systems steely exoskeletons and whizzing hunter-killer drones. As before the key players in this back story are military leader John Connor (Jason Clarke who had much better remake luck in ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"") and battle commando Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney who was no more fortunate in ""A Good Day to Die Hard""). As in the 1984 original Reese will be sent back in time in a rescue mission for Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke of ""Game of Thrones"") Johns mother an assassination target for a humanoid robot that has just arrived back then. If that seems agreeably familiar overstuffed dialogue quickly pushes the enjoyment aside. Jason Clarke an actor who likes stepping into another persons nature in a manner as immersive as possible delivers verbose conversations to his loyal wingman Courtney who adores him like a handsome German shepherd. Clarke builds his way up to inspiring his blood brothers with an oration that rivals the St. Crispins Day speech in Shakespeares ""Henry V"" chewing the scenery into soggy mulch. Terminator Genisys 1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of sc-fi violence and gunplay throughout partial nudity and brief strong language. So why would he waste precious time on eloquent vocalizing when Mom needs to be saved? Because the script defies basic reason the laws of physics and emotional logic to a stunning degree. Prepare for twist after head-slapping twist. Once Reese arrives in 1984 he learns to his chagrin that interfering with the course of history creates all sorts of unexpected consequences. This time the past looks a lot like the world of the future. Reese no sooner hits the L.A. back alleys of the original ""Terminator"" than he is attacked by a ""Terminator 2 Judgment Day"" liquid metal T-1000 from a decade later. Sarah Connor is no damsel in distress but a gun-toting warrior woman rescuing Reese rather than being saved by him. Her private Terminator called Pops (Arnold Schwarzenegger visibly timeworn but durable) battles a digitally cloned version of himself from 40 years past. Soon we are questioning the team of Jason Clarke and Courtney debating if one is a straight-shooting good ol boy and the other a shady operative. Emilia Clarke and Courtney imply their romantic potential in scenes resembling an apocalyptic season of ""The Bachelor."" Melissa Sue Gordon Paramount Pictures Emilia Clarke plays the role of Sarah Connor in ""Terminator Genisys."" Other cast members emerge with only minor flesh wounds. Schwarzenegger is amusing as the ""old not obsolete"" android who has still not learned how to smile beyond baring several dozen teeth. J.K. Simmons wasted in a role as a needless secondary character proves that he is one of the best performers in the business even when hes asked to look constantly surprised and pitch weak jokes. With rote combat scenes random beam-me-up leaps across decades and gymnastic games of muscle car chicken resembling ""Fast and Furious"" outtakes the film stumbles to a climactic coda attacking Skynets Silicon Valley birthplace. Now rather than a missile defense system gone mad it is reimagined as a Google-like business offshoot determined to crush homo sapiens with mobile phones and Twitter. Weve seen bad remakes of science fiction classics recently from ""Total Recall"" to ""Robocop"" but none has missed the mark by so many light years as this. If ""Terminator Genisys"" was dumbed down any further it would be subterranean. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; terminator-genisys ) Terminator Genisys (United States 2015) June 30 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli Hes back. After not appearing in a Terminator film for 12 years Arnold Schwarzenegger has returned to one of the roles that made him the biggest action star of the 80s and early 90s. Will anyone care? This is the seventh film Schwarzenegger has appeared in since his return to acting and none of the previous six has made a dent at the box office. The pundits are sure hes a dinosaur whose time has long since passed. Indeed the actors future as a leading man is almost certainly tied into the worldwide gross of Terminator Genisys. The film does what many fans of the series are prepared to do ignore the existence of Terminator 3 and Terminator Salvation. Those movies while enjoyable on their own terms added little to the core mythology. Terminator Genisys sets itself up as a direct sequel of The Terminator and T2 Judgment Day. As such it hews close to the storyline established by James Cameron. In fact the film is so closely aligned with the first two productions that it may be difficult to follow or appreciate without having seen them. Terminator Genisys feels like the film Cameron might have made if he continued the franchise. In fact he did a little uncredited consulting and has become a part of the marketing campaign. Whether at his friend Schwarzeneggers behest or because hes genuinely enthusiastic about Terminator Genisys Cameron has stated that this represents the ""true"" continuation of the series. Theres much to be enthused about in the way screenwriters Laeta Kalogridis amp; Patrick Lussier and director Alan Taylor choose to continue the story. Influenced both by Back to the Future 2 and J.J. Abrams Star Trek reboot the movie plays with time lines and alternate universes to establish its storyline. The film covers territory previous encountered in The Terminator and T2 but with some notable differences. Things start out as we remember them before going off-road. As always the objective is the same use events in the past to save the future. The films handling of time travel is questionable. Its approach to paradoxes is inconsistent evidencing more of a Doctor Who-flavored fantasy approach than a harder sci-fi one. Terminator Genisys jumps from era to era the post-apocalyptic future where John Connor (Jason Clarke) rallies his troops for the final attack on Skynet; 1984 where Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) lands in his quest to protect Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke) from that attack of a T-800 (Schwarzenegger); and 2017 the new date of Judgment Day. The style and tone are retro sci-fi action. Its like T2 only bigger and louder. There are plenty of fights a few chases (thankfully none are too long) and a lot of heavy-duty special effects. A few of the robot-on-robot battles go on too long - there comes a time when this becomes tiresome. The best of these altercations comes early in the proceedings when a 40-year old Terminator takes on his younger self. The complex process of creating an animated de-aged Schwarzenegger is remarkable this is the first time weve seen something quite like this. It looks as if the filmmakers used footage from The Terminator but thats apparently not the case. The visuals are impressive (although the 3-D is a useless distraction) and Brad Fiedels signature score gets to shine at the right moments. The best one-liners like the best fight scenes are reserved for Schwarzenegger.  Its too soon to tell whether Terminator Genisys will have a catch phrase like ""Ill be back"" or ""Hasta la vista baby"" but there are several candidates. Much of the films comedy results from The Terminators failed attempts to emulate human behavior. Marketing can be the filmmakers best friend but it can also be an enemy. James Cameron discovered this when making T2. His intention was to keep The Terminators allegiance a secret but the marketing department decided this was too good a nugget to pass up for public dissemination. History has repeated itself for Taylor. A key twist intended to be kept under wraps until audiences discovered it for themselves has appeared in the trailer the poster and other publicity devices.  I wont divulge it here but the revelation will have a greater impact for those unaware of it. Terminator Genisys is blessed with an eclectic cast. Although Jason Clarke and Jai Courtney fall into the ""lesser known"" category the same cant be said for the other major players. Schwarzenegger is of course an icon; even at age 67 he does many of his own stunts. Emilia Clarke embodies Sarah Connor perfectly stepping seamlessly into Linda Hamiltons shoes and bringing along with her a legion of Game of Thrones aficionados. Her fan base is perhaps exceeded only by that of the former Doctor Who Matt Smith who has a small but critically important role. Finally theres an Oscar winner on hand although it would be fair to say that J.K. Simmons is underused. Terminator Genisys isnt going to convert anyone. Those who dont like or dont understand the franchise arent going to start singing its praises.  This was made for those who loved James Camerons inaugural episodes but may have strayed in the past 24 years. Like Jurassic World it relies heavily on nostalgia. For what it is it delivers. Its hard to imagine any other Terminator story doing a better job of reuniting us with familiar characters in a reality that as is always the case when time travel is involved isnt quite what were used to. For those who felt the series had long ago grown old and run out of gas Terminator Genisys proves there are more than fumes left in the tank. And although the ending offers the possibility of a sequel it doesnt demand one. Now comes Judgment Day - not in the movie but for it.

Photo Melinda Sue Gordon Associated Press Terminator Genisys Arnolds back but the rest lacks that spark 1 / 5 Back to Gallery It would be easy to judge ""Terminator Genisys"" against most modern action films and say fine its good enough. But anyone who has ever seen ""Terminator 2""-- especially anyone old enough to remember the excitement that movie produced -- has to look upon ""Terminator Genisys"" as a mild letdown. Still its better than ""Terminator 3"" (or ""Terminator Salvation"" if you really want to count that one) and its good to see Arnold Schwarzenegger reprise one of his signature roles. This sequel repeats some of the patterns of the earlier films with characters going back in time either to prevent things from happening or to make sure they do. But ""Terminator Genisys"" is very much of the moment in its concern that technology is getting out of hand that the machines are taking over. The ""Genisys"" of the title is a new operating system that is going to link up the entire world -- and then wipe out civilization. How exactly the operating system will do this or how peoples signing up for the system makes it easier for them to get blown up is not made clear. Just accept that as one character puts it ""People are inviting their own destruction through the front door and they dont even know it."" But now youve been warned so look out. ""Terminator Genisys"" is as convoluted as ""The Godfather Part III"" only without Al Pacino saying that every time he thinks hes out they pull him back in. Actually if Schwarzenegger said that line here it would have fit just fine. Instead we get scenes like the one in which two people explain the same complicated concept to someone four times -- but really for our benefit -- and the audience still doesnt have a clue. The year is -- well the year is a lot of different things here. But following a recap of history in which the Transamerica Pyramid and the Golden Gate Bridge are obliterated before the opening credits the movie formally begins in 2029 with John Connor (Jason Clarke) leading the human forces to free the Earth from robot rule. The Earth or at least California is a dark desolate place and the robots have no aesthetic taste. Everything is burnt out falling down and ugly. Connor sends his right-hand man Kyle (Jai Courtney) back to 1983 to protect Connors mother who is only 20 and has not yet given birth to John. Upon arrival Kyle finds that Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke) is already feisty having spent most of her young life warding off terminator attacks with the help of her own terminator (Schwarzenegger) whom she calls Pops. Pops is looking a little older these days but thats because the terminators are made with real human skin which ages. Still as Pops says ""Im old but Im not obsolete."" Realizing they must stop Genisys the three decide to go into the future though at first they have considerable difficulty choosing between 1997 and 2017. Eventually they decide on 2017 not because they dislike big wraparound sunglasses and boxy suits but because 2017 is the date that Genisys is scheduled to launch. In what sounds like a parody maybe intentional of the way every intrusive privacy-annihilating technology is heralded as a convenience the movie has several people gushing about how with Genisys all their devices can be linked Playing a robot Arnold doesnt engage much in small talk and while this has been the pattern for all ""Terminator"" movies ""Terminator Genisys"" is still at its best when Arnold is onscreen even if hes only staring down people or looking at them quizzically. Those moments without Schwarzenegger are particularly noticeable here because Emilia Clarke and Courtney for all their winsomeness are not quite enough to carry a whole movie alone. Theyre good but not good in that way especially in a story where they have to keep contending with jumbled hard-to-convey science. In the end the problem with the films convolutions isnt that they make an audience feel confused. They make an audience feel helpless. The movies notion that time is never a fixed entity is all well and good as an intellectual conceit but it lends the proceedings a sense of futility. The characters struggle risk their lives and blow up yet more stretches of San Francisco just to bring about a certain set of conditions. Meanwhile it can all be undone by one robot who might arrive next week -- or whenever it is they decide to make another ""Terminator"" movie. There are too many shootouts involving robots that cant be injured. Once we figure out that they cant really do each other damage why keep showing them fighting? Its dull. Still for all its weaknesses ""Terminator Genisys"" is a ""Terminator"" movie that feels like a ""Terminator"" movie more than did ""Terminator 3"" not to mention the ghastly ""Terminator Salvation."" It doesnt rise to the proper heights but its not a throwaway. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

When he arrives in 1984 though nothing is as he expected it to be. VPCArnold Schwarzenegger returns as the Terminator in ""Terminator Genisys"" an origin story of sorts.(Photo Paramount Pictures)Story HighlightsCritics rating 3 stars out of 5Arnold Schwarzenegger returns as a graying cyborg in the fifth installment.Taking over as Sarah Connor is Emilia Clarke of ""Game of Thrones"" fame.""The Terminator"" is a masterpiece of sci-fi horror a heavy-metal nightmare about a relentless killing machine that never stops coming no matter how much damage it takes from bullets pipe bombs and exploding fuel tankers.Theres something similar going on with popular culture in the 21st century when no franchise no matter how moribund is ever beyond resuscitation. Which brings us to ""Terminator Genisys"" the fifth film in the series that launched in 1984 and seemed to grind to a halt with the superfluous prequel ""Terminator Salvation"" in 2009.""Genisys"" is more entertaining than the last two installments although its not nearly as good as the first two which were directed by James Cameron. It starts out looking like a straight-up remake of the original with several tedious minutes of repeat exposition about intelligent machines and their war to exterminate humanity. But when Resistance leader John Connor sends gung-ho Kyle Reese back to 1984 everything is different from the first go-round. The past has already been changed and were in an all-new time line.MORE2015 summer movie guideArnold Schwarzenegger is back -- as he always promises he will be -- as the T-800 Model 101 Terminator a cyborg with a metal skeleton covered in human flesh. And we are told that human flesh can age which explains why this particular Terminator comes with graying hair and a distinctly crotchety attitude ""Im old not obsolete.""In this time line the Terminator first arrived in 1973 programmed to protect young Sarah Connor who will one day give girth to John from time-traveling assassins. So when Reese arrives 11 years later he finds not a damsel in a distress but a pint-size badass who gets to utter those immortal words ""Come with me if you want to live.""Replacing Linda Hamilton as the mother of the Resistance is the Mother of Dragons Emilia Clarke of ""Game of Thrones"" fame looking less ethereal and more girl-next-door as a brunette instead of a blond. Also no relation to Jason Clarke the actor playing her characters son.Emilia Clarke of ""Game of Thrones"" fame plays a young Sarah Connor in ""Terminator Genisys."" (Photo Paramount Pictures)Though shorter and less intense than Hamilton Emilia Clarke has good screen presence and plenty of spunk. But there isnt really time for her to develop much chemistry with her various male counterparts including love interest Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney as a buffer version of the character created by Michael Biehn). They are far too busy battling Terminators -- including an Arnie look-alike a shape-shifting T-1000 and of course an upgraded model even more powerful than the rest.In another update the story takes a detour to 2017 where the genocidal software known as Skynet has been given a makeover for the current generation of iPhone-carrying Instagram-addicted tech heads. But somehow the more things change the more they stay the same and ""Terminator Genisys"" ends up feeling less like a reboot and more like a mashup of all the previous films with plenty of CGI action and a good deal of insider humor but none of the genuine menace that made Camerons movies such a great one-two punch.AZCENTRALTerminator Genisys (2015) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsAs for plot this one is thin unconvincing and a bit hard to follow but that means less and less in the ""Terminator"" universe.

Share Tweet These days every Arnold Schwarzenegger performance is a battle between the present and the past To watch the Austrian muscleman play his advancing years for comedy (the Expendables series) or pathos (the recent Maggie) is to see a once-herculean action star acknowledge that hes not the perfect human specimen he used to be. Terminator Genisys the fifth installment in the blockbuster franchise James Cameron abandoned almost 25 years ago comes close to making that conflict literal. In one corner you have current Ahnold back in biker black to reprise his most iconic role the relentless and re-programmable T-800. In the other you have the spitting digital image of his younger self a phantom foe plucked straight out of 1984. Forget logistics for a second and just marvel at the house-of-mirrors spectacle of Schwarzenegger whaling on Schwarzenegger. Its an even more crowd-pleasing title fight than the one that closes Jurassic World this summers other extended nostalgia trip to the dawn of the CGI era.The comparison is instructive Both Genisys and Jurassic take a fan-fiction approach to rejuvenating their brands echoing popular early installments while completely disregarding the continuity of less-popular later ones. (At least theyve got an excuse here--the retconning possibilities of time travel which allow for whole stories to be wiped clean.) This new Terminator the first since the dreadfully dreary and Arnold-less Salvation is engineered to feel at once eerily familiar and raise-the-stakes fresh. Part sequel part reboot it gives us a car chase and a helicopter fight an explosive attack on a lab and a visit to a weapons stash ""Ill be back"" and ""Come with me if you want to live."" It also re-deploys that menacing mound of metallic goo the T-1000. Incidentally the movie itself is something of a T-1000 traveling back in time to mechanically replicate what it isnt.If youve seen Camerons gritty original you know how things start In a future ruled by sentient killing machines leader of the human resistance John Connor (Jason Clarke walking in the footsteps of Edward Furlong Nick Stahl and Christian Bale) sends his most trusted soldier Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney filling in for Michael Biehn) into the past to protect his mother from the cyborgs. Its when the buck-naked traveler arrives in Los Angeles circa the 1984 of the first film that Genisys goes off script. Turns out Reese has landed in a past thats already been altered where Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke bringing that Daenerys determination) has gone Linda Hamilton badass way ahead of schedule thanks mostly to a childhood spent under the care of a T-800 she calls Pops. The script helpfully explains that Terminator tissue ages just like the human kind which conveniently accounts for the wear and tear on Schwarzeneggers pushing-70 physique.Genisys whose misspelled subtitle refers to the advanced operating system that will eventually become Skynet takes a Back To The Future Part II approach sending characters careening from 2029 to 1984 to 2017. There are intersecting timelines memories of alternate pasts and flashbacks to future events. The film smartly masks its convoluted exposition with humor ""Time travel makes my head hurt"" Reese groans as Pops rattles on about quantum this and nexus that. J.K. Simmons also drops by for some effortless comic relief playing a beat cop who spends three decades obsessing about the time he saw a kill bot in action. Hes our audience surrogate nerding out as all hell breaks loose.These fighters for the future humanitys last hope in the battle against Skynet seem less stoically burdened than the ones Cameron introduced in his one-two punch of sci-fi-action mastery. Theres an almost screwball levity to their interactions Courtney and Emilia Clarke circle each other with a whos-saving-who flirtatiousness while Schwarzeneggers conspicuously nicknamed machine watches like a concerned father from the sidelines. Genisys more than its predecessors seems vaguely self-aware of how dysfunctional how perverse even Terminators central relationships are. This is a series remember where a man sends his best friend back in time to put the moves on his mother engineering his own conception. Here screenwriters Laeta Kalogridis and Patrick Lussier add a new 12 Monkeys wrinkle to that matchmaking design. It gets weird.The film moves so fast--an explanatory prologue a big battle scene and Reese jumping through time are all covered before the opening credits have finished rolling--that its easy to overlook how weightless most of it is. Director Alan Taylor who made the second Thor film and several episodes of Game Of Thrones keeps the conveyor belt of CGI-abetted action running at all times; those who come hoping to see a bus do a flip or a shape-shifting robot melted by acid wont leave disappointed. But Taylor lacks Camerons sheer virtuosity his gift for integrating digital spectacle into a physical world--which wouldnt be such a huge deal if the film wasnt constantly tweaking and re-staging key set pieces from Terminator 2. Again were in Jurassic World territory here with a director nodding to a seminal special effects movie he hasnt the chops to equal.But Judgment Day wasnt just a pillar of studio escapism the kind of thrill machine that summer movies have been aspiring to ever since. It was also an oddly touching doomsday family drama one that maybe even earned--in its cathartic climax--the tears the T-800 couldnt cry. Genisys by contrast is just empty fan service a perfectly watchable facsimile that never instructs its audience to feel anything except a fondness for the older movies it recalls. When one character flips allegiances halfway through the film the change of heart packs no emotional wallop just the quick sting of a plot twist. The only real resonance is in the sight of a sexagenarian action idol boldly resisting retirement one robot slugfest at a time. ""I am old not obsolete"" Schwarzenegger insists throughout in what handily serves as a mission statement for his post-politics acting career. If but this franchise extension--fleet shiny forgettable--could fend off its own obsolescence.

"A messy Terminator Genisys shows why bigger is not always better - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review A messy Terminator Genisys shows why bigger is not always better Terminator Genisys Movie review by Mark Olsen Mark Olsen reviews Terminator Genisys. Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger Jason Clarke Emilia Clarke Jai Courtney Lee Byung-hun and J. K. Simmons. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Mark Olsen reviews Terminator Genisys. Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger Jason Clarke Emilia Clarke Jai Courtney Lee Byung-hun and J. K. Simmons. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Mark OlsenContact Reporter Though the character is now part of the pop-cultural firmament and Arnold Schwarzeneggers signature role anyone who could travel back in time to just before the release of ""The Terminator"" in 1984 would know it as a modestly budgeted little anticipated sci-fi action film. The film was driven to heights of greatness by the cyber-punk imagination of writer-director James Cameron his growing skills and confidence as a filmmaker and the near-perfect coalescing of performer and role with Schwarzenegger as a time-traveling killer cyborg.Camerons 1991 ""Terminator 2 Judgment Day"" had a bigger budget more ambitious storytelling and cutting-edge computer-generated visual effects that made it an idealized template to this day for what a summer movie can be outsized surprising and fun. INDIE FOCUS Sign up for our weekly movies newsletterWith Cameron no longer involved the rights to the franchise -- we call them franchises now -- have recently landed with a new production team that is operating as if the more recent third and fourth films in the series do not exist. (If only audiences had the same luxury.) Or within the story logic of the new ""Terminator Genisys"" those other films exist only on their own discrete alternate timelines. In smashing together elements from the first two ""Terminator"" movies with Digital Age anxiety over connectivity and privacy the new movie is kind of like a wedding DJ remixing period hits with a modern beat. Which is to say ""Terminator Genisys"" is no fresh start -- its a mess. James Cameron puts his stamp of approval on Terminator Genisys Meredith Woerner The father of the ""Terminator"" franchise James Cameron has seen ""Terminator Genisys"" and despite the befuddling title he is impressed. So impressed in fact that he made a video stating just that. But also in this video is a bit of new footage that reveals the Terminator vs. Terminator showdown... The father of the ""Terminator"" franchise James Cameron has seen ""Terminator Genisys"" and despite the befuddling title he is impressed. So impressed in fact that he made a video stating just that. But also in this video is a bit of new footage that reveals the Terminator vs. Terminator showdown... (Meredith Woerner) In the year 2029 a resistance led by John Connor (Jason Clarke) is on the brink of destroying the evil anti-human operating system of Skynet when he discovers a lone assassin has been sent back in time to kill his mother to prevent his birth. Soldier Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) is sent back to 1984 to protect Sarah (Emilia Clarke) only to discover she has been expecting him. Much is different from what Reese thought he would find including the aging Terminator (Schwarzenegger) who has been protecting Sarah since childhood. Images from ""Terminator Genisys."" The trio of Sarah Reese and the guardian Terminator eventually move forward in time to 2017 in an attempt to stop the consumer system known as Genisys from going online before its ability to connect all technology creates a humans-vs.-machines battle to overthrow humanity. In perhaps the sharpest idea in the film we will be sold and happily buy our own destruction.""Terminator Genisys"" could be Exhibit A in why the current line of thinking in Hollywood regarding sequels/reboots/remakes often leads to terrible decisions and worse films. The movie produced by David Ellison and Dana Goldberg (Ellisons sister Megan Ellison gets an executive producer credit) and written by Laeta Kalogridis and Patrick Lussier is part sequel part starting over. The popular term is ""reimagining"" taking some things and not others which in this case apparently really means not entirely thinking things through. Director Alan Taylor is best known for his work on prestige cable dramas like ""Game of Thrones"" and ""The Sopranos"" and the lesser Marvel entry ""Thor The Dark World."" And while there are plenty of action sequences in ""Terminator Genisys"" none is especially memorable or rousing.One effect in particular in which a character disintegrates into a digitally created particulate storm seems designed specifically to re-create the wow factor of the liquid-metal Terminator in ""T2."" Alas the new effect seems more like something out of a tech ad than a techno-nightmare parallel realm of existence. And thankfully there is still a difference.The story requires a lot of explaining as to who is where in what time period and why and whether certain characters are on this side or that. Theres one big character twist revealed in the films marketing materials that isnt worth the bother of giving away here. It feels less like a surprise and more like the filmmakers just throwing up their hands and admitting they dont know how to get their way out of all this either.J.K. Simmons has a supporting role as a man who has spent decades trying to explain to people what he saw in an alley one night in 1984. Trying to describe the movies plot can leave one similarly feeling like an incoherent babbler.In the second ""Terminator"" film Linda Hamiltons intense driven performance as Sarah Connor along with her muscular arms became defining peak 90s imagery. The first two films set a high bar for female characterization and in ""Genisys"" Emilia Clarke simply isnt given the same kind of material to work with.She is not a damsel in distress exactly but giving the character a lifelong protector does dial back her self-sufficiency by more than a few degrees. As part of a squad she often feels lost in the shuffle. In her part on ""Game of Thrones"" Clarke brings a coiled energy to the screen ready to strike and unfortunately this Sarah Connor is no Mother of Dragons.At one point Clarke explains why the protector Terminator she calls ""Pops"" has aged -- the living tissue around his robot skeleton ages like a human -- and the line feels like a studio note in the margins written into a screenplay meant to answer a restless audiences questions. As the story becomes increasingly convoluted eventually Schwarzeneggers friendly Terminator blurts out that alternate timelines are not complicated with essentially the same level of exasperation as when he exclaimed ""Its not a tumor"" in ""Kindergarten Cop.""Rather than a counter-argument to the recent emphasis on practical effects in films such as ""Furious 7"" or ""Mad Max Fury Road"" the intensive computer-generated imagery in ""Terminator Genisys"" proves the point that there is often an additional emotional and psychological heft to films with reality-sourced imagery. As digital helicopters bounce around the sky bridges are demolished mountain lairs exploded molecules scrambled and characters moved back and forth in time it is as if the filmmakers level of engagement is diminishing right alongside the audience. Bigger is not better complicated is not the same as complex. And it shouldnt take a time-traveling cyborg to explain why.mark.olsenlatimes.com Twitter IndieFocus------------Terminator GenisysMPAA rating PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and gunplay throughout partial nudity and brief strong languageRunning time 2 hours 6 minutesPlaying In wide release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Reviews Entertainment Movies Emilia Clarke Travel James Cameron Jai Courtney Pivotal moments in Arnold Schwarzeneggers movie career Terminator Genisys Whats in a (misspelled) name?

Director Alan Taylor (206). PG-13 Violence. Area theaters. ""Terminator Genisys"" is a steaming pile of molten metal. The future didnt have to be this way. The last two entries in the three-decade-old franchise -- ""Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines"" (2003) and ""Terminator Salvation"" (2008) -- werent great but they left the door open for what might have been worthwhile additions to the original 1984 classic and its great 1991 sequel. One achievement of James Camerons ""Terminator"" is that it overcame its low-rent B-movie trappings. The great sin of ""Genisys"" is that it costs millions and yet isnt worth a dime. The plot alone happening on three different timelines will make you dizzy. It begins in 2029 with humans about to strike a finishing blow on the evil machines controlled by the all-seeing global computer program Skynet. But mankinds savior John Connor (Jason Clarke) still must send his friend Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) back to 1984 to protect Johns then-20-year-old mother Sarah Connor from the Terminators whose mission is to kill her and prevent Johns birth. Kyle goes back but finds a different world than he was expecting. For one thing Sarah (Emilia Clarke) isnt a naive waitress. Shes a trained survivalist looked over by a kindly Terminator T-800 she calls ""Pops"" (Arnold Schwarzenegger). Turns out the machines have been jumping earlier into Sarahs timeline requiring the Austrian-accented T-800 terminators to do the same thing. Arnold Schwarzeneggers ready for action in ""Terminator Genisys."" (Melinda Sue Gordon) Reese realizes that if they want to stop Skynet from taking over the worlds weapons systems -- on the date known as Judgment Day -- they have to go to 2017 when the Genisys program is set to trigger Skynets weapons system. So he and Sarah use a quantum particle machine to leap there as Pops waits for them and stockpiles an arsenal. Flash-forward to 2017 when all three catch up to John Connor who in this altered future has a sinister interest in Skynet and whose savior status isnt what Reese thought it would be. This movie isnt what people thought it would be either. The clunky script puts roadblocks in its own path requiring endless conversations about what happened when and why and whats changed. Schwarzenegger is the best thing in the movie but whose idea was it to put loads of expositions in his mouth? The erstwhile action icon has plenty of strengths but narration isnt one of them. As Sarah Emilia Clarke (""Game of Thrones"") is too cherubic for the part Linda Hamilton once played -- even at 20 Hamilton was more strong and gritty than starlet-pretty -- and has no chemistry with Courtney who stands around looking dumb. Jason Clarke gives John Connor a basic scarred-leader turn without any of the brooding of previous JCs Christian Bale Nick Stahl or even Edward Furlong. His speeches are tinny as is his eventual secret. (And did someone think it was funny to cast everybody named Clarke?). Emilia Clarke plays Sarah Connor in ""Terminator Genisys."" (Melinda Sue Gordon/Parmount Pictures) From left Emilia Clarke Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jai Courtney in ""Terminator Genisys"" (Melinda Sue Gordon/Paramount Pictures) Emilia Clarke in ""Terminator Genisys"" (Melinda Sue Gordon/Paramount Pictures) Jason Clarke (l.) as John Connor and Jai Courtney as Kyle Reese in ""Terminator Genisys."" (Melinda Sue Gordon/Paramount Pictures) The liquid-metal Terminator from ""T2"" here played by Korean action star Lee Byung-hun pops up without thrills. Oscar winner J.K. Simmons injects a bit of humor as a cop whos been trying to convince people for more than 30 years that robots are coming and technology will destroy us. Director Alan Taylor (""Thor The Dark World"") by necessity cant let the 67-year-old former Governator run the show but just as in James Camerons original ""Terminator"" Schwarzenegger is the best special effect here. The reason the T-800 looks old is well-explained -- his synthetic skin is designed to age so he can blend in -- but the punch Schwarzenegger provides it turns out is timeless. A scene of Pops fighting his younger self is the best moment in the film. But every other action scene is stale uninspired and unexciting as if everyone was too concerned about explaining how the unnecessary story came to be instead of showing us why it was done. If the least robotic thing in your ""Terminator"" movie is the robot youre in big trouble. Hasta la vista ""Terminator"" franchise.

When he arrives in 1984 though nothing is as he expected it to be. VPCArnold Schwarzenegger is back in Terminator Genisys.(Photo Melinda Sue Gordon Paramount Pictures)Terminator used to be a sci-fi franchise defined by its cool time-travel concept and even better special effects. Unfortunately its ""Hasta la vista baby"" to those good old days.Constant confusion and intermittent boredom are on tap in Terminator Genisys (1/2 out of four; rated PG-13; opens Wednesday nationwide) a movie just as ridiculous as the spelling of its subtitle.Director Alan Taylor (Thor The Dark World) tries to relaunch the series that James Cameron began in the 1980s though Cameron seems to be the only one with the golden touch. The last two installments were complete messes and the only thing watchable in Genisys is elder statesman Arnold Schwarzenegger.USA TODAYSchwarzenegger unveils older wiser modelInstead of doing something fresh with the well-tread premise the new film is wholly derivative from the start running down the apocalyptic scenario of the global defense system Skynet getting a mind of its own and wiping out most of humanity. (Thanks nuclear holocaust)John Connor (Jason Clarke) leader of the human resistance seemingly wins the day over the machines in 2027 but sends his soldier buddy Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) back to 1984 to keep an assassin Terminator from killing Johns mom and preventing him from being born.USA TODAYTerminator is back and buff with special effectsYes if youve seen the original Terminator you know how that goes. But something squiffy happens as naked Kyle is getting teleported and he somehow ends up in an alternate timeline where Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke) is waiting for him with a loyal Terminator named ""Pops"" (Schwarzenegger).Now the impending ""Judgment Day"" when Skynet turns evil isnt 1997 but instead 2017 when Skynet plans to take over courtesy of an operating system on everyones portable devices called Genisys. Think of it as an Apple iOS update thats more frustrating than usual.USA TODAYSchwarzenegger still wields those killer linesOn the whole its best not to think too much about the shifting timelines whos coming from where and how the time-space continuum should work because its all nonsensical. Events that have changed from Terminator movies past are simply glossed over and never explained and the truest piece of dialogue is when someone sighs ""Time travel makes my head hurt.""You said it buddy.USA TODAYSchwarzenegger As a husband I failedThe best twist in the movie has already been ruined in trailers -- lets just say the major villain of the piece may be state of the art but he doesnt have the same brutal relentlessness as Schwarzenegger in the original Terminator or Robert Patricks liquid-cool T-1000 in the sequel.Clarke is caught between Linda Hamiltons waitress-in-distress Sarah from the first film and the hardcore warrior woman in the second never really owning the role outright. J.K. Simmons is wasted in a cop role that begs to be larger and a mysterious character played by Matt Smith (Doctor Who) is arguably the most interesting player in the entire movie but is barely used as well.USA TODAYWalk like a Terminator We get a lessonConvoluted timelines and one-dimensional characters are one thing but the most unforgivable sin Genisys is guilty of is being dull. No Terminator movie should ever be boring yet the action scenes drone on for too long and none wow as much as the most average scene from the classic Terminator 2.Schwarzenegger is the best special effect going here causing a few laughs breaking out the signature catchphrases and giving a hefty sense of muscular nostalgia whenever hes on screen. But next time he states ""Ill be back"" the appropriate response should be ""No thanks."" 116 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 12 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1LTo3Hj",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/06/30/terminator-genisys-movie-review/29506423/,200,terminatorgenisys19,terminatorgenisys,usatoday
"Review Terminator Genisys shows real life thanks to Schwarzenegger - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Terminator Genisys shows real life thanks to SchwarzeneggerBy Tony Hicksthicksbayreanewsgroup.comPosted 06/30/2015 122230 PM PDTUpdated 07/01/2015 083037 AM PDT Arnold Schwarzenegger came back for ""Terminator Genisys."" So ... is that a good thing?It probably is for the Terminator franchise which had served up two straight lackluster chapters (the last one without him except for a cameo). And its good for Schwarzeneggers post-political career which seemingly depends on how well he can revive former roles (dont be surprised when Hollywood feels the need to see how a 70-year-old Conan the Barbarian is faring). As for you the moviegoer how well ""Terminator Genisys"" works depends on your mindset. Its certainly watchable despite the temptation to figure out the jumble of time-travel math. But if you think this is a ticket back to the surprising quality and dark tone of the original 1984 film you will be disappointed. Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator in Terminator Genisys. (Melinda Sue Gordon/Paramount Pictures) ( Melinda Sue Gordon/Paramount Pic ) On the plus side Schwarzenegger brings his familiar charisma to the project which allows the franchise to regain its sense of humor for the first time since the second ""Terminator"" film. Seeing Schwarzenegger in a new ""Terminator"" movie is like visiting a favorite uncle from childhood; its enjoyable even though hes not exactly how you remember.The new films foundation centers heavily on what happened in the first two installments as director Alan Taylor (""Thor The Dark World"") attempts to refocus the story arc. As the film opens John Connor (Jason Clarke) is winning the battle against Skynet the terror-inspiring computer web that nuked most of humanity into dust. Connor knows Skynets last play is to send a Terminator into the past to kill his mother Sarah (Emilia Clarke). He sends his lieutenant Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) through time to stop Skynets Terminator.Advertisement If it sounds like the story line from the original 1984 film the new twist is that someone (who remains the films big mystery) sent old Uncle Arnie back to protect Sarah just after she was orphaned as a child. Now as Sarahs father-figure (she calls him ""Pop"" which is kind of weird but OK) he takes on her enemies who also includes a more modern unnecessary non-Schwarzenegger Terminator also sent back to kill Sarah from some unknown time.Right. Because time travel isnt complicated enough for us to wrap our brains around.After the much anticipated Arnold versus Arnold showdown -- it isnt nearly as spectacular as the trailer leads us to believe -- Kyle Sarah and Pop eventually head back to the future to stop Skynet. Thats where theyre met by a John Connor who turns out to be someone other than who we thought he was (thats not a spoiler it was divulged in the films trailer). John becomes the supercharged nemesis in a refreshing change that allows Jason Clarke to shrug off the heroic John Connor legacy and pump his revised character full of sneering badness.Until bad John emerges ""Terminator Genisys"" suffers from its natural comparisons to the first two films. Emilia Clarke gives a decently sassy if a bit soft performance as Sarah Connor. But she doesnt have the chance to develop into a badass before our eyes like Linda Hamilton did. And Courtneys version of Reese simply lacks Michael Biehns sharp steely-eyed intensity. And the necessary chemistry between Sarah and Kyle is shaky at best.Despite all that heres why the movie eventually works Schwarzenegger can still pull off a stoic albeit aged Terminator. Lets face it hes likable in the role especially this time when hes doing the dad-threatens-the-new-boyfriend thing. And when the real action finally picks up its like being launched forward on a crazy roller coaster after minor repairs kept you waiting in the station too long. Whether the franchise can actually be revived -- and there are a couple of big unresolved plot points that make it obvious thats the intention -- is debatable. The bottom line is that ""Terminator Genisys"" is a fun ride as long as fans accept that its not up to the standards set by the original. But at least its the franchises best big-screen effort in more than two decades.Contact Tony Hicks at Facebook.com/BayAreaNewsGroup or Twitter.com/tonyhicks67.

Updated July 29 2016  153 pm Full Forecast News Sports Business Go Life Buy/Sell Movie reviews New Terminator is old damaged goods By Joe Williams St. Louis Post-Dispatch Joe Williams Jun 30 2015 (...) Imagine a world in which a gap-toothed bodybuilder with a thick Austrian accent becomes the biggest action-movie star on Earth. Imagine another one in which he becomes the governor of California. And imagine a third in which hes so tarnished by scandals that he becomes a global laughingstock.Now toss those alternate realities into a whirling four-dimensional vortex controlled by global overlords and set the timer to ""half-bake."" What emerges is ""Terminator Genisys"" the most batty and self-aware episode in the stop-the-robots franchise that started back in 1984.After 30 years and five movies its almost impossible for an ordinary human to remember or even care about all the details of the T-verse. (Thumbnail version In 1997 a missile defense system called Skynet turns against its human creators kills 3 billion people and devises humanoid robots to kill off the survivors including the prophesied leader of the resistance.) This new installment both reconstitutes the best bits from the previous movies and turns the premise inside-out. Thus soldier Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney whos an Australian Chris Pratt without the charm) once again travels from the future to safeguard Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke a less-butch Linda Hamilton) until she can give birth to rebel leader John (Jason Clarke with too-distracting battle scars). But then future-John becomes an evil cyborg and follows Reese from 2029 to 2017 to neutralize his own mother before Judgment Day 2.0The strongest hope for humanity is the reformed T-800 robot aka Sarahs protector Pops (Arnold Schwarzenegger back after a one-episode layoff and a dubious detour into politics). In a meta-movie moment that will surely be the talk of Comic-Con a digital version of a naked young Ah-nold beams down from the future dispatches some mohawked punk-rockers and then grapples with his middle-age self in a tsunami of molten metal.Its either cagey or cruel that fanboys will have to wait almost two hours to hear the gray-haired Schwarzenegger say ""Ill be back"" (during a high-altitude effects sequence around the Golden Gate Bridge that is the best part of the movie). In the long stretches between phony flashes of humor Sarah borrows the Terminators oft-used line ""Come with me if you want to live"" and John Connor co-opts Sarahs speech about the robots having no remorse. In other words this mash-up movie is like a greatest-hits compilation for obsessive collectors.On its own terms ""Terminator Genisys"" makes virtually no sense. It tries to cover its plot holes by circling back to worlds-within-worlds but director Alan Taylor (""Thor The Dark World"") doesnt have the chops to make ""Inception."" Instead he throws kitchen sinks into ever-bigger kitchen sinks hoping it will make an interesting noise. This hardware has been sputtering for a long time. By now we should be wary if Schwarzenegger promises ""Ill be back ... to clean up the mess.""What ""Terminator Genisys""  Two stars out of four  Run time 205  Rating PG-13  Content Intense sequences of sci-fi violence and gunplay throughout partial nudity and brief strong language Joe Williams  314-340-8344Film criticjoethecritic on Twitterjoewilliamspost-dispatch.com Terminator Genisys Two stars out of fourRun time  205Rating  PG-13Content  Intense sequences of sci-fi violence and gunplay throughout partial nudity and brief strong language Tags Arnold Schwarzenegger Jason Clarke Jai Courtney Emilia Clarke Joe Williams Joe Williams Joe Williams is the film critic for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

One of the greatest science-fiction movies of the 80s a decade that also saw the release of ""Blade Runner"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back."" Standards were high. ""Terminator Genisys."" The most unnecessary movie of the summer of 2015 a season thats already been marked -- make that marred -- by ""Entourage."" Movie Review 1/2   Terminator Genisys with Arnold Schwarzenegger Emilia Clarke Jai Courtney Jason Clarke. Directed by Alan Taylor from a screenplay by Laeta Kalogridis and Patrick Lussier. 126 minutes. Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and gunplay throughout partial nudity and brief strong language. Several theaters. When Arnold Schwarzenegger intoned ""Ill be back"" in 1984 the phrase propelled him to movie superstardom and eventually the governors mansion in California. Now when he says it in ""Genisys"" you can only think ""Why did you bother? Youre past your sell-by date Pops."" Most Read StoriesThinking of voting for Jill Stein or Gary Johnson?

And sure enough the big lug lugs a big fuzzy teddy through one section of the movie. Sweet yes? Well no. Desperate is more like it. After four previous ""Terminator"" movies not to mention TVs short-lived ""The Sarah Connor Chronicles"" director Alan Taylor and writers Laeta Kalogridis and Patrick Lussier really had to scratch and scrape to find new ways to resuscitate the moribund franchise -- and Arnies career. The answer an alternate time line -- in which Sarah is re-imagined as the one who repeatedly saves Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) the soldier from the future who is sent back to the 20th century to save her and by extension her son John (Jason Clarke) and by further extension humanity from nuclear holocaust and enslavement by the machines of Skynet. ""Pops"" is Sarahs longtime and long in the tooth protector. A machine with gray hair. The movie has an explanation for that and a catch phrase ""Im old not obsolete."" Its repeated several times as if to convince everybody in the picture as well as the audience that old Arnie still has the old moxie. Fail. The picture performs a massive overhaul of the familiar characters their relationships and motivations. In the words of a minor character ""its really really complicated."" And really really confusing with Arnie talking a lot of impenetrable techspeak about ""nexus points"" and ""quantum fields"" that sounds pretty funny coming from him. Plenty of noisy cyborg-on-cyborg CG violence with lots of clangy metallic head-butt action is part of the mix. Sound and fury signifying its past time to put this franchise out to pasture.

Directed by Alan Taylor and starring Emilia Clarke Arnold Schwarzenegger Jai Courtney and Jason Clarke. (Paramount Pictures) By Michael OSullivan June 30 2015 Much like the ""cybernetic organism"" played by Arnold Schwarzenegger throughout the ""Terminator"" film franchise a movie critic is only part living human tissue; the rest is ruthless killing machine. The human part at least in theory is capable of appreciating what everybody else goes to summer blockbusters for action jokes cool special effects suspense and emotion. The machine part must analyze plot acting character development dialogue and other aspects of the films construction. These dual roles are often at odds with the robot side seeking out and blasting a films flaws with cold-blooded efficiency and the mortal side sometimes wishing its other half would just put down the weapons and let the rest of us enjoy the ride. In more ways than one the battle between man and machine has never been so pitched as it is in ""Terminator Genisys"" the fifth film in the sci-fi series that began in 1984 with a simple but gripping tale of a man trying to protect a woman from a time-travelling automaton assassin sent from a post-apocalyptic future in which humans are at war with technology. The new film centers on a killer computer app called Genisys -- imagine the ""cloud"" on steroids -- but its also a schizoid mix of thrill ride and headache-inducing logic holes. Part sequel part reboot and part remake ""Genisys"" is both seriously fun and seriously flawed. At the same time it makes for a decent follow-up at least to the first two films which are generally considered to be the franchises best. (The less said about ""Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines"" the better. The most recent sequel""Terminator Salvation"" isnt half bad.) [Heres your ticket to the 2015 Summer Movie Guide] Emilia Clarke of ""Game of Thrones"" fame plays a fully formed big-gun-firing Sarah Connor in ""Terminator Genisys."" (Melinda Sue Gordon/Paramount Pictures) ""Genisys"" begins nicely enough with a faithful recreation of the original films opening following a prologue set in 2029 that introduces us to some of the films new cast. Here Jason Clarke plays John Connor the leader of the human resistance against the robot army. Jai Courtney is Kyle Reese Connors lieutenant who is about to be sent back in time to protect Connors mother Sarah (Emilia Clarke) from the cyborg hit man that has been sent to kill her so that her son will never be born. Once again the lethal robot is played by Schwarzenegger whose younger 1984 body -- seen in all its naked glory -- has been digitally spliced into the film. This retro sequence is a giggle even if it panders to easy nostalgia. But it gets better. Within minutes Kyle discovers that the 1984 into which he has been dropped is not the familiar timeline of the first film. The scene is soon crowded with other more advanced models of robotic ""terminators"" than Schwarzeneggers prototypical T-101 including a version of the second films liquid-metal T-1000 played by Korean action star Byung-hun Lee. There are other surprises and if you dont want them spoiled Id avoid the entire Internet for the next few weeks including all of the films over-sharing trailers. In this alternate branch of time Sarah Connor is no damsel in distress in need of saving as she was in the first film. Here the character is already the badass that actress Linda Hamilton morphed into in the second film. Unfortunately Clarke -- whose casting seems a cynical attempt to capture the actresss young ""Game of Thrones"" demographic -- isnt quite as convincing as Hamiltons ""T2"" heroine was. Even at 28 the British actress comes across as something of a petulant high-schooler and she looks a little out of place wielding the big guns that the part requires her to handle. More problematic is the whole time-travel element which in ""Genisys"" takes on a much more prominent and quite frankly confusing role than in any of the previous installments. The new movie not only jumps from 2029 to 1984 but forward again to 2017 with detours -- courtesy of miscellaneous memories flashbacks and dialogue allusions -- to 1979 1997 and 2014. Its hard to keep track of all the threads at times even apparently for some of the films characters. ""How can I remember a past Ive never lived"" asks Kyle who after showing up in 1984 starts hallucinating a childhood far more halcyon than the one he used to think he had. ""Ive got to know whats going on"" bemoans a cop (a wonderfully befuddled J.K. Simmons) who in 2017 suddenly remembers meeting Kyle and company way back in 1984. ""Were here to stop the end of the world"" Sarah replies essentially telling him to let it go. I suggest you do the same. Time travel is always a risky proposition. Its easy for filmmakers to get carried away and to hope that the audience wont notice the necessary cheats. In ""Genisys"" it feels a bit like director Alan Taylor (""Thor The Dark World"") just doesnt care about the little loopholes he leaves in the films pell-mell rush from one calendar entry to another. The script by Laeta Kalogridis (""Shutter Island"") and Patrick Lussier (""Drive Angry"") is so far from airtight theres practically a breeze. But there are also many pleasures the deepest of which come courtesy of Schwarzeneggers enduringly fun bionic warrior which like a classic wooden roller coaster gives a reliably rousing if at this point somewhat rickety ride. James Cameron who co-wrote and directed the first two films before disappearing was wisely brought in as a kind of character consultant by Skydance Productions. The touch of the ""Terminator"" creator is apparent here. ""Genisys"" goes back to what made the franchise work in the first place not the machine inside the man but vice versa. PG-13. At area theaters. Contains violence partial nudity and brief crude language. 125 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

But who can blame a studio for trying? The durable premise perfect for sequels concerns an unstoppable killing machine. Arnold Schwarzenegger is willing to play no fewer than three different versions of his iconic villain turned protector so no problem there. And when we think of this series were really remembering the gooey Terminator 2 Judgment Day (1991) a sequel for the ages. But Terminator Genisys is missing something major--it might be as simple as James Cameron. At first the new chapter feels like a straight-up reboot sending future soldier Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney dull enough to make you miss Michael Biehn) back to a cheapo 1984 Los Angeles to protect mother-of-the-revolution Sarah Connor (Game of Thrones Emilia Clarke no Linda Hamilton). Just as director Alan Taylor starts skimping on Camerons original horror beats he shifts to the metallic ooze stuff not as shocking as it was in the 90s. The main problem though has to do with moving the goal line too many times. If Arnolds ancient T-800 here affectionately called Pops is already a good guy if Sarah is already a buff warrior if her son might not even figure in humankinds salvation and if the nuclear fire of Judgment Day is were now told triggered by a fancy computer operating system that gets launched in 2017s Silicon Valley (back to the time machine) where do we hang our interest? Thats never made clear. Helicopters explode mercury skin bristles and the Golden Gate Bridge clears for a competent yet weightless chase scene but theres a distinct lack of emotional stakes. Fans hoping to watch Schwarzenegger growl his catchphrases with a slight edge of shtick are underestimating the patience involved in sitting through a two-hour slog. As for those who want a little apocalyptic tension or (dare to dream) romance this new model is not for you. Its the Skynet cut.

Photo Paramount Pictures MOVIE REVIEW Terminator Genisys Running time 126 minutes. Rated PG-13 (nudity language). Its hard for ""Terminator Genisys"" to have too much heft when its subtitle is essentially ""Rise of the App."" In the fifth installment of this series Skynet -- that murderous artificial intelligence -- is set to Trojan-horse itself into 2017 via Genisys a platform-unifying software that seems like a slightly better version of the Cloud. Oh the humanity Itll be our iPhone obsession that gets us in the end. Fighting the Luddite fight are Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke) her unsuspecting baby-daddy Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) and thankfully Arnold Schwarzenegger reprising his role as the benign Terminator reprogrammed to protect Sarah. Dubbed ""Pops"" by his charge hes the ultimate dad-bot -- single-mindedly focused on Sarahs safety and full of dorky humor. Arnold Schwarzenegger in ""Terminator Genisys.""Photo Paramount Pictures John Connor (Jason Clarke) Sarahs son and the leader of the resistance sends soldier Reese back to 1984 to find pre-warrior Sarah. ""Shell be weak"" he warns. Only shes different because the timelines been altered; now jacked-Sarah and Reese must time-travel to stop Genisys. Reese as central narrator is new but the stolid Courtney (""Insurgent"") lacks the charisma for it. Hes the kind of no-nonsense guy you can believe might have been excited about getting Genisys for his 12th birthday (who needs the latest video game when you can have all your devices handily linked?). This happens in one of two possible timelines; in the other Reese is born into a post-apocalyptic world and raised by John Connor. Who sends him back in time to stop this timeline from happening. And to father John. Jai Courtney as Kyle ReesePhoto Paramount Pictures Confused yet? Theres a saying in time-travel sci-fi that the process degrades the traveler and the ""Terminator"" movies have been through too many plot-accelerators shedding brain cells along the way. Director Alan Taylor (""Thor The Dark World"") lacks the vision of a James Cameron and whats left is a mechanical shell of a good idea. Youd think Emilia Khaleesi on ""Game of Thrones"" could channel Linda Hamilton but her Sarah is mild compared to Hamiltons maniacally driven mom-soldier. Jason flexes his dramatic muscles as John deals with a new challenge -- but ultimately he too is drowned out by all the CGI. The rest is a remix of Camerons greatest hits. Look theres the T-1000 the liquid-metal robot that was super-cool in 1991s ""T2."" Here are the old lines -- ""Come with me if you want to live""; ""Ill be back"" -- and Schwarzeneggers creepily attempting to smile. In one of the films best moments aging Arnold fights in-his-prime Arnold -- and wins. Hes ""old but not obsolete"" Arnie proclaims a line thats then repeated enough to render it irritating. A T-800Photo Paramount Pictures Poor Matt Smith (""Doctor Who"") appears briefly as the sinister embodiment of Skynet. As John Connors firing up the time travel gizmo he side-eyes the camera as if to say ""I gave up my TV gig for this?"" JK Simmons (""Whiplash"") is similarly thrown in as a cop who crossed paths with Sarah and Kyle in 1984 and has tracked them ever since. Seen as a wingnut hes one of the only people who believes their story which doesnt amount to much. Still he provides a little comic relief and sums up my feelings on this whole outing ""Goddamn time-travelin robots"" Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Filed under arnold schwarzenegger  emilia clarke  jk simmons  movie reviews  the terminator Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Magic Mike XXL is a raunchy romp despite skimpy plo...

JOHN SEMLEY Special to The Globe and Mail Published Tuesday Jun. 30 2015 1235PM EDT Last updated Friday Jul. 03 2015 730AM EDT Comments AA Directed by Alan Taylor Written by Laeta Kalogridis Patrick Lussier Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger Emilia Clarke Jai Courtney Jason Clarke Classification 14A Year 2015 Country USA Language English Before his death in 1986 the great Russsian filmmaker and cinema philosopher Andrei Tarkovsky managed to see James Camerons 1984 sci-fi neo-noir The Terminator. ""The brutality and low acting skills are unfortunate"" Tarkovsky said ""but as a vision of the future and the relation between man and his destiny the film is pushing the frontier of cinema as an art."" It may feel like Stravinsky praising Springsteen but Camerons original thriller skates across a number of Tarkovskian themes particularly the cyclical nature of experience and memory (displayed in Terminators time-travel paradoxes and the overlapping realities they create) and the relationship between humanity and our environment. In Camerons film however that environment was not the natural world or even the spiritual one but the technological ecosystem.Still there was something deeply inhuman in the Terminator films that scrapes against the notion of Tarkovsky The Cinemas Great Spiritualist. The world of Camerons The Terminator - and its subsequent sequels of which the dopily-named Terminator Genisys is the fourth - always felt thoroughly mechanical. Even destiny was algorithmic with humanitys destruction at the hands of a sentient super-computer called Skynet seemingly unavoidable despite its hardscrabble protagonists explosive efforts to avoid it.This inevitability along with those time-travel paradoxes mentioned above also serve as a handy way of reviving the Terminator franchise whenever such a revival washes out as sufficiently profitable. ""Theres no fate but what we make"" characters in these movies often chant and it never felt entirely convincing when any new future could be unwritten by a subsequent movie sent chugging down the assembly line.That Terminator Genisys is such a chugging redundant product goes without saying. Accusing a sequel released 30-plus years after the original of being superfluous is like accusing a cheeseburger of having cheese. Whats remarkable is that this fifth Terminator is worthwhile precisely because of its franchise cash-in excessiveness. Its at once an eminently satisfying actioner jackknifing tractor-trailers and vertiginous helicopter chases and all as it is a passably thought-provoking comment on memory - headily engaging with the very nostalgia it intends to evoke.So. Its 2029 the sentient machines are enslaving mankind and bad-boy messiah John Connor (Jason Clarke) dispatches his right-hand man Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) to 1984 to save his mom Sarah (Emilia Clarke) from a Terminator robot sent back through time to kill her thus ending the human resistance before it could start.The plot - which is the setup for the original Terminator - hits a snafu when its revealed that Skynet had already sent another Terminator further back in time and that the humans sent yet another one back to stop that one and that that Terminator (the ones the human sent back) ended up raising young Sarah and training her for the day Reese would arrive.That paternal robot-assassin is nicknamed ""Pops"" and played naturally by Arnold Schwarzenegger whose weathered appearance is rationalized as the result of the Terminators organic skin aging in real time. As if that wasnt enough loopy nonsense the wrinkle in time opens up an alternate timeline in which Reese and Connor must travel to 2017 meet up with Pops and stop the rise of Skynet Trojan-horsing its way into homes via a new operating system called Genisys described as ""the ultimate killer app.""Writers Laeta Kalogridis (Shutter Island) and Patrick Lussier (Drive Angry 3D) have good fun mucking about in the time paradox gobbledygook while director Alan Taylor rushes his B-grade cast through references to the original film(s) like theyre curating a YouTube supercut.But where they hit upon something interesting is in their statement about the nature of humanity. Here Skynet yearns to be human even adopting a physical form. More than looking like us it wants to endure to pass on its computer-genetic legacy.Yet what Skynet cant understand is why Reese Connor and company would struggle so vainly against its superiority. Genisys finds its humming humanizing centre in the idea that unlike a machine evolving uniformly toward sentience and singularity we can be proud haughty and downright stupid working against our own best interests not because it makes any sense but because we feel like it. (These feelings this innate sense of our place in the world bubble up in intersecting flashback sequences that evoke a sense of what Tarkovskys Terminator might have looked like.)Like Edgar Wrights The Worlds End another film about humanitys robotic takeover Genisys configures human arrogance - our refusal to accept inevitability or even sensibility - as our saving grace. Our vanity our satisfaction in our own supremacy simply does not compute.No fate but what we make. Until they make the next Terminator anyway.

"Terminator Genisys review Rooting for the apocalypse - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Terminator Genisys review Rooting for the apocalypse Movie review Terminator Genisys packs powerful punch Melissa Sue Gordon / TNS Jason Clarke plays John Connor who with Sgt. Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) leads the human resistance. Jason Clarke plays John Connor who with Sgt. Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) leads the human resistance.  (Melissa Sue Gordon / TNS) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune A machine could write a more interesting ""Terminator"" sequel. Humanity gets a do-over in ""Terminator Genisys"" the fifth in the franchise begun in 1984 with ""The Terminator."" But this screwy revision of the previous ""Terminator"" movies is so muddled and yakky you may find yourself rooting for the apocalypse. At one point Arnold Schwarzenegger is thrown through a wall into a Pepsi Max vending machine (if the rise of the machines means the fall of product placement Im all for it) and for a second I was pulling for a slugfest between the former bodybuilder and the Pepsi dispenser. Just to see whod win.Remember how the second ""Back to the Future"" film got mixed up in alternate time-lines and parallel universes and such? Delivered in wee truckloads of exposition by Laeta Kalogridis and Patrick Lussier ""Terminator Genisys"" is like ""Back to the Future Part II"" times 20 or the more recent ""Looper"" with a hundred extra loops. Director Alan Taylors picture begins as a homage/recap/rip-off of the first cheapest meanest and best ""Terminator"" the one written and directed by James Cameron. We learn of the nuclear devastation and the rise of the machines vending and otherwise and the decimation of all that was good and true on our planet. Sgt. Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) explains as much in voice-over focusing on the 3 billion killed off on Judgment Day 2017.The narrative starting point is 2029 with the human resistance being led by Reese and his legendary mentor John Connor (Jason Clarke whose characters true character is foreshadowed in a way that puts the ""obvious"" in ""obvious""). Thanks to time travel were soon back in 84 and then forward to 2017 on Judgment Day eve. Sarah Connor the tank-topped Mother Courage of the revolution is portrayed by Emilia Clarke the Mother of Dragons  of ""Game of Thrones."" She calls her guardian Terminator played by Schwarzenegger ""Pops"" who repays her for the endearment with moral lectures delivered in monotone. Sarah Connor meantime bickers with Reese with whom she must mate so that she can give birth to the man who will alter the course of -- oh hell thats enough. There are scenes of ""old"" Arnold thrashing his younger 84 self. There are scenes featuring J.K. Simmons bless him as a sympathetic and dogged ally of our motley heroes that redeem entire minutes of the movie. The title refers to a ""killer app"" and coveted operating system that gives rise to the fall of humanity. Made on a reported (and mystifying given its lack of visual imagination) budget of 170 million ""Terminator Genisys"" doesnt take any pokes or try any dark satire in its technology-enslavement angle. This is strictly business and dull business at that for all the metal/flesh impalings and a bus dangling from the Golden Gate Bridge. The bridge is destroyed in the flashback prologue and got creamed in ""San Andreas"" earlier this year. Does landmark status count for anything in California? Terminator Genisys (Clip) Terminator Genisys clip I Didnt Kill Him (ScreenPlay) Terminator Genisys clip I Didnt Kill Him (ScreenPlay) See more videos Arnold for the record has a new catchphrase ""Im old. Not obsolete."" He also reprises his greatest hit ""Ill be back."" He may have trouble pronouncing the word ""cellular"" but that doesnt matter. Everythings at stake yet nothing comes to much in ""Terminator Genisys."" I did admire the sight of the disintegrating Bad Terminator struggling to break free of an MRI but by the time Arnolds hushed by one of his exasperated cohorts with ""Whaddya gonna do talk us to death?"" a very expensive and very poorly written movie has begun to disintegrate itself.Phillips is a Tribune Newspapers critic.mjphillipstribpub.com Twitter phillipstribune""Terminator Genisys"" -- One-and-a-half starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for intense sequences of sci-fi action violence and gunplay throughout partial nudity and brief language) Magic Mike XXL review The complete package Michael Phillips ""Magic Mike XXL"" comes up a little short compared with the original director Steven Soderberghs blithe and bonny Channing Tatum showcase inspired by Tatums salad days as a male stripper.

Paramount Pictures TNS TNS TNS TNS AP TNS Terminator Genisys    (out of five) Director Alan Taylor Cast Arnold Schwarzenegger Jai Courtney Rated PG-13 (intense sequences of sci-fi violence and gunplay throughout partial nudity and brief strong language) Running time 125 min. By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 331pm on Thursday Jul. 02 2015 Thursday Jul. 02 2015 Tuesday Jun. 30 2015 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Someone needs to go back in time and stop movie executives from greenlighting more ""Terminator"" movies.Its not that Terminator Genisys -- a reboot that mixes and matches the classics The Terminator and T2 Judgment Day but ignores the less regarded T3 Rise of the Machines and Terminator Salvation -- is a laughably bad movie. Worse its an interminably boring one.Things kick off well enough as director Alan Taylor ( Thor The Dark World) plunges viewers into the big battle between humans and the machines created by Skynet the global computer system that develops consciousness and decides to rid the planet of humanity. John Connor (Jason Clarke Zero Dark Thirty) leads the humans to victory but somethings amiss. A Terminator (the younger version of Arnold Schwarzenegger) has been sent back to 1984 to kill Connors mother Sarah to stop John from being born.Using the same technology Connor sends his most trusted lieutenant Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney Insurgent) back in time to protect Sarah. But in this timeline Sarah (Emilia Clarke Game of Thrones) is already aware of the danger shes in as she has been protected from an early age by a different Terminator (the current Schwarzenegger). Now they have to travel to the the year 2017 when Skynet goes online to stop the switch from being flipped. TG does have its moments. Seeing the older Schwarzenegger take on the digitally recreated version of his younger self is kind of fun. J.K. Simmons ( Whiplash) as a bumbling cop provides a hint of comic relief.But so much of TG feels like a retread of the superior first two Terminator films. The entire chase scene involving the shape-shifting T-1000 Terminator (Byung-hun Lee) could have been lifted from Judgment Day. Meanwhile Courtney and Clarke both generic in the extreme here have little chemistry together.Theres a major plot twist (that has already been leaked through the trailers) but its still not enough to spark flagging interest.At just over two hours TG wears out its welcome and predictably ends with a cacophony of explosions. Though if you still care by then stay through the credits for a hint of whats planned for the next one.Unless of course someone can jump back in time to stop it.

After some time off for politics and lots of bad choices (a few of which turned into worse movies) Arnold Schwarzenegger returns as an unstoppable robot in ""Terminator Genisys."" Hes a lot bulkier now. His hair is greying his mechanical joints creak and some skin has chipped off revealing the shiny metal underneath. Frankly he looks the worse for wear. So does his series. The first in whats (optimistically) planned as a trilogy ""Terminator Genisys"" mixes together elements from the first two films directed by James Cameron (and smartly mostly ignores the third and fourth installments misdirected by other hands). But its new story is still familiar. In fact overfamiliar. Once again Kyle Reese is sent back in time to protect Sara Connor so she can give birth to John Connor - the hero who will lead the human race in its future fight against Skynet an army of genocidal machines. And Kyles got to hurry because Skynet has their own time traveler - a Terminator robot whose only job is to kill Sara first. The tale had some novelty in its first go-around (although Harlan Ellison famously disagreed); it actually got better in its second iteration which had good and bad Terminators and instead of seeing Sara as just an influential incubator made her a feminist kick-butt heroine. But ""Terminator Genisys"" merely retells a story that was already well-told - and frankly old. And its version complicates things without making them interesting and adds several new faces without finding one we really want to watch. Yes its good to see Das Arnie lumbering through this again and he has some fun with the character (particularly in his awful attempts to be a bit more human and smile). But petite baby-faced Emilia Clarke never quite convinces as Sara (whos already tough as nails by the time this film opens). And Jai Courtney and Jason Clarke are respectively smug and creepy as Kyle and John. Worse the movie makes a hobo stew of its own mythology throwing in everything and anything it can find. Not only is the ""good"" Terminator from ""T2"" on hand but sos the bad one from the first film - and the liquid-metal one from ""T2"" and still another new syntho-human. And while I admit time travel movies usually give me a headache this one pushed it into migraine status. Kyle goes back to 1984 to save Sara - but finds the original good Terminator already there on the job since 1973. Wait howd that happen? And why do they then go to 2017 to rush to stop Skynet? Why not you know travel to 2016 and take their time? True director Alan Taylor knows something about implacable lifelike automatons marching toward the apocalypse - after all one of his first jobs was directing episodes of ""Sex and the City."" But this movie is more like the too-much too-loud spectacle he brought to the ""Thor"" sequel - explosions that turn into firestorms widescreen blurs that suggest that somewhere there may be a fight going on. Or maybe a movie. But while the first two ""Terminator"" films had a clever concept some appealing characters and a strong theme of self-sacrifice - all of which you can thank Cameron for - this latest one just feels like a crass setup to make two more movies (and quickly before the rights expire). ""Im old -- not obsolete"" Schwarzenegger growls throughout. This movies both. Ratings note The film contains violence brief nudity and strong language. Terminator Genisys (PG-13) Paramount (125 min.) Directed by Alan Taylor. With Arnold Schwarzenegger Emilia Clarke Jai Courtney Jason Clarke. Now playing in New Jersey.

The good ones lay out a set of rules that as preposterous as they may seem operate within their own air-tight logic. The heady puzzle pieces eventually snap neatly and satisfyingly into place. The bad ones on the other hand treat these rules as arbitrary and mutable changing them to suit their storys needs as they go along. The faith is broken. Terminator Genisys is a bad time-travel movie. Ever since its inception in 1984 James Camerons apocalyptic franchise has been battling an enemy more lethal than skeletal future-shock killing machines. The first two installments were both exquisitely engineered entertainments wedding brainteasingly byzantine narratives and brawny action mayhem courtesy of the Austrian Oak Arnold Schwarzenegger. Since then the series has been on a steady decline with 2003s Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines and 2009s Terminator Salvation--two sequels which had no real reason to exist other than as brand-awareness cash grabs. With the exception of Ahnulds return I suppose there wasnt any reason to expect more from Genisys other than the lure of watered-down nostalgia. But it barely even succeeds at that. The film kicks off post-Judgment Day after Skynet has become self-aware and has turned on its human creators wiping out three billion people. The messianic leader of the resistance John Connor (Jason Clarke) sends his lieutenant Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) back to 1984 to protect Connors mother Sarah (Emilia Clarke) safeguard the future and wipe out Skynet before it turns bad. When he gets there naked as a jaybird Sarah is waiting for him delivering the signature line ""Come with me if you want to live."" Also there Schwarzeneggers now-aged T-800 (whom Sarah lovingly calls ""Pops"") and a liquid-metal T-1000 assassin which is cool but  less so than it was in 1991s Terminator 2. For a while the sight of Schwarzenegger reprising what is arguably his most iconic role packs a retro thrill. But soon director Alan Taylor (Thor The Dark World) and writers Laeta Kalogridis and Patrick Lussier make a hash of the sagas mythology tweaking timelines and messing with its tenets for their own convenience. The story isnt just confusing its a betrayal to anyone whos invested brain cells in the Terminatorverse over the past 31 years. There are thickets of exposition about ""quantum fields"" ""nexus points"" and a nefarious killer-app called Genisys but it doesnt add up. And the new cast--Courtney and both Clarkes --dont offer enough charisma to cover up all the nonsense. Theyre the definition of ""serviceable."" Even the films Easter eggs for die-hard fans feel soft-boiled. Like a lot of other 3-D extravaganzas released in recent summers Genisys is a wildly expensive decent-looking mildly diverting mess that doesnt make a lick of sense. Its connection to older better movies cons us into believing its better than it is. Its a movie made by humans (Im assuming) that feels like it was programmed by machines--machines on the fritz.

The new film still has murderous robots sent from the far-flung future to kill Sarah Connor (here played by ""Game of Thrones"" star Emilia Clarke) in 1984 before she gives birth to John Connor the future leader of the human resistance that will decades later lead the fight against the computer intelligence that wants to destroy humanity. And theres still Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney""gt;Jai Courtney this time around) as the human resistance fighter sent back to 1984 protect her. But now theres more thanks to Patrick Lussier and Laeta Kalogridis screenplay -- more and different robots more and different timelines more and different iterations of Arnold Schwarzeneggers T-800 and of course plenty of loose ends to be tied up in future films. See Video Terminator Genisys Trailer J.K. Simmons Just Wants to Help Sarah Connor At the same time director Alan Taylor (""Thor The Dark World"" ""Game of Thrones"") gives us a film in which all of that ""more"" just means less. While ""Terminator Genisys"" doesnt skimp on fights or philosophy both feel somewhat perfunctory A personification of the films bad guy doesnt display much personality; Skynet has gone from a military program to being a portable hip killer app for consumers with the ""killer"" part being literal; the newest upgrade to the Terminator line is an assassin made of nanomachines that can utterly subsume any human cell by cell then shift shape or dissolve into dust before reconstituting itself to murder once again. Most of these addenda represent change for changes sake and ""improvements"" that arent and while the film tries to get inside itself -- offering familiar lines coming from different characters in new contexts repeating visual gags like what happens when you shoot a T-1000 in the eye including the fact that Schwarzeneggers T-800 has learned to smile sort of -- the recent ""Jurassic World"" did a much better job of putting a sharp cynical edge on the familiar parts of an older franchise. Also Read 9 Summer Movie Burning Questions Can Marvel Disney Survive Success? Where Are the Black Movies? Is Terminator a Crazy Gamble? Production designer Neil Spisak (""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" ""Spider-Man 3"") does a superb and praiseworthy job here as the film flickers through time periods making each seem distinctive while also keeping a consistent look for the film. Performances on this latest franchise installment are competent. Clarke has turned looking imperiled-but-resolute into a one-woman industry on ""Game of Thrones"" so its no surprise she does so well here. Schwarzenegger is game and aided substantially by stuntmen and CGI. Jason Clarkes John Connor is nicely done even if we only see a bit of him while Jai Courtney is a little too adequate especially because we see him a lot. While the script feels frantic it never feels epic; its too busy traveling through time and space to actually go anywhere while the films attempts to make us care about the relationship between Clarkes Connor and the Terminator whos been protecting her feel a little too close to -- and yet too far from -- the bonding between Schwarzenegger and Edward Furlong in ""T2."" Also Read Arnold Schwarzenegger Wears Terminator Genisys Costume to Prank Fans (Video) The stunts and CGI and attendant action scenes are all simply fine; theres nothing here with the stark simple power of ""The Terminator"" or the strong-but-strange brilliant inventions of ""Terminator 2."" Instead its all less-than-spectacular ""spectacle"" and plot convolutions twisting around themselves at the whim of the summers least interesting killer artificial intelligence. (Compared to Ava from ""Ex Machina"" Skynet looks as outdated and old-school as anything in 1970s ""Colossus The Forbin Project."") The least inspiring thing about ""Terminator Genisys"" is how its a fifth film that doesnt improve or expand on the prior four so much as its meant to clearly set up Part Six Part Seven and possibly even more. In 1984s ""The Terminator"" machines came back from the future to wipe out humanity; with ""Terminator Genisys"" a whole franchise comes back from the past to water down summer moviegoing.

TWITTER Arnold is back in the latest installment of the Terminator franchise co-starring Emilia Clarke of HBOs Game of Thrones. Arnold Schwarzenegger once again declares ""Ill be back"" in this fifth installment of the Terminator franchise but enough already. Spending half its time showing unkillable cyborg characters getting shot up only to quickly heal themselves and the other half trying to explain a plot that rewrites the entire series Terminator Genisys will serve as a good litmus test of how keen the public is to see basically the same old thing in a new (but very similar) bottle. At one point Schwarzeneggers lifelike robot tells his cohorts ""Im old not obsolete"" but that will be up to audiences to decide; the sorry track record of the stars six post-gubernatorial features means that a lot is riding on the box-office of this continuation of his most popular franchise. Thanks to the visual effects equivalent of expert plastic surgery the actor who was 37 when the first series entry was released in 1984 and is now 67 more or less convincingly spans that time frame in terms of looks as he helps Sarah Connor and her son John try to save humankind -- and themselves -- from the victory of the machines. How many times have we seen the Golden Gate Bridge destroyed in a big budget movie in past years? Has there been time to rebuild it since San Andreas a few weeks ago? And lets not forget Pacific Rim Star Trek Into Darkness Godzilla and Rise of the Planet of the Apes before that. Well it happens again here as part of the nuke attack thats part of the back-story that must be altered if humanity is be given another chance. Laboring with the problem of how to return to a well that many fans justifiably thought ran dry with McGs Arnold-free Terminator Salvation in 2009 screenwriters Laeta Kalogridis and Patrick Lussier have worked out an elaborately rigged scenario in which John Connor (Jason Clarke) son of Sarah by 2029 has led the human resistance to nearly total victory over the worlds Skynet oppressors. But when he learns that at the last second the enemy has been able to transport another indestructible killer (basically an Asian version of Robert Patricks T-1000) back to 1984 to kill his mother to ensure that he John would never be born he hurriedly sends the buff and capable Sgt. Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) back in time to protect Sarah and block the remaking of history. Read more Arnold Schwarzenegger Pranks Terrifies Fans at Madame Tussauds Series fans will relish the care with which director Alan Taylor and his team recreate in the flashback the feel of James Camerons original; Reese arrives naked in the same dark and grungy downtown Los Angeles alley to be greeted by a homeless derelict. Assaulted by the sleek and determined new terminator (Byung-hun Lee) Reese in short order is joined by the original edition (you know who looking very young) giving Sarah (Emilia Clarke) the protection she needs until they all make the jump back to the future in which son John looks older than Mom. This time-jumping contrivance plays well enough but what actually goes on in the scenes set 14 years hence feels rote and unimaginative. Action scenes are accumulated as if mandated by a stop-watch and almost invariably seem like warmed-over versions of stuff weve seen before in Terminator entries and elsewhere. The first three films in the series were R-rated and viscerally benefited from it; this one is rated PG-13 and its action scenes feel like diluted rehashes obligatory and devoid of visual creativity in the same way the violence feel staged and photographed. With Taylor coming aboard as director and Clarke assuming the role played a generation ago by Linda Hamilton the series is clearly aiming to benefit by association with the ultra-violent Game of Thrones. But while she can be feisty at moments Clarke cant do much to give dimension to the very one-note character of Sarah and that goes double for Courtney as Reese a role even more devoid of depth or wrinkles physical or otherwise. Read more Arnold Schwarzenegger Ill Be Back for Sequel to Terminator Genisys That leaves it to Arnold to save the day but age has given him a vocal in addition to physical stiffness; hes still imposing and amusing up to a point but he cant dominate the way he did thirty years ago. And so the film just lumbers along often tediously; theres no sense that the scenario has been carefully kneaded structured and shaped by attentive dramatists. Visually weve seen these images -- or many like them -- so many times before and the score accentuates the retread feel with its monotonous thudding. A little surprise insert during the end titles suggests that a follow-up to Terminator Genisys is already intended by its makers. But if Arnold really wants not only to come back but to be welcomed back hell one day need to unterminate. Production Skydance Cast Arnold Schwarzenegger Emilia Clarke Jai Courtney J.K.

""Im old not obsolete"" mutters Arnold Schwarzeneggers aging android in ""Terminator Genisys"" and his words could be a wishful mantra for this nervy silly almost admirably misguided attempt to give the 31-year-old franchise a massive cybernetic facelift. More or less rewriting everything we thought we knew about the Connor genealogy the properties of liquid metal and the rules of post-1984 time travel this f/x-encrusted reboot feels at once back-to-basics and confoundingly revisionist teeming with alternate timelines and rejiggered character histories (the most perplexing of which finds Sarah Connor now continually referring to Schwarzeneggers Terminator as ""Pops""). Consider it the 3D blockbuster equivalent of disruptive technology and while online fans have already voiced their displeasure the movies willingness to veer crazily off-course feels less objectionable than the monotony and sense of self-parody that kick in long before the whimper of a finish. The return of a top-billed Schwarzenegger (here playing three different versions of his most iconic role) should lend Paramounts July 1 release a bit more box office oomph than Warner Bros. managed with ""Terminator Salvation"" (2009) which the actor skipped while finishing the second term of his political career. Still a mere six years after that poorly received mediocrity (the movie not the political career) its safe to say the ""Terminator"" movies werent exactly crying out for this sort of extreme overhaul. And in a season when the studios have been busy updating their pre-millennial action-cinema touchstones its unlikely that this new film will find itself in the same commercial league as ""Jurassic World"" and ""Mad Max Fury Road"" let alone the next chapter of ""Star Wars."" That Paramount has positioned ""Genisys"" as the start of a new ""Terminator"" trilogy cant help but smack of undue optimism. Fan uproar aside the series underlying mythology is hardly an inviolable one and for a while its easy to admire the daring with which screenwriters Laeta Kalogridis and Patrick Lussier shake things up and reframe the events of the earlier films from a bizarre new perspective. Exploiting the narrative possibilities of time travel on a more vigorous and elaborate scale than its relatively self-enclosed predecessors ""Genisys"" effectively returns us to the events of James Camerons ""The Terminator"" (1984) stirs in the buddy-Arnold dynamics of ""Terminator 2 Judgment Day"" (1991) borrows the man-machine-hybrid plot device from McGs ""Terminator Salvation"" and more or less pretends that Jonathan Mostows ""Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines"" (2004) never happened (""never happened"" being an admittedly unstable concept in this particular universe). Accompanied by a familiar blast of Brad Fiedels original ""Terminator"" theme a prologue solemnly announces that 3 billion people died in the nuclear conflagration of Judgment Day on Oct. 29 1997. Some 30 years later the malevolent machines of Skynet are losing the war with a surviving remnant of humanity led by an impassioned revolutionary named John Connor (Jason Clarke his face marked with scars). So far so familiar -- except that when Kyle Reese (Australian actor Jai Courtney) gets zapped back in time to rescue Johns mother Sarah a last-minute twist suddenly alters his trajectory When Kyle lands in a dark Los Angeles alley in May 1984 the machines are already waiting for him in the form of a lethal T-1000 who possesses blades for hands reconstitutes himself at will and is played by Korean star Byung-hun Lee. (Clearly this version of Skynet isnt just self-aware but also hip to the realities of the all-important Asian movie market.) Working with a crew that includes production designer Neil Spisak and cinematographer Kramer Morgenthau director Alan Taylor fastidiously re-creates individual shots and scenes from Camerons 1984 movie -- right down to the appearance of the evil T-800 achieved with a massive silicone replica of a nude bulked-up 37-year-old Schwarzenegger. But before the T-800 can do any real damage hes ambushed by Schwarzeneggers slightly older leaner good-guy Terminator treating us to the brief spectacle of an Arnold-vs.-Arnold faceoff before Sarah Connor (English actress Emilia Clarke ""Game of Thrones"") steps in to finish the job. Turns out Sarah has been under the protection of her Austrian-accented guardian since she was 9 years old and she knows full well that Kyle has come back in time to save her life and inadvertently father her child. She even gets to bring some gender parity to the proceedings by uttering the signature line ""Come with me if you want to live"" All this unfolds in an unusually cheeky self-conscious register and ""Terminator Genisys"" proves most diverting (or depending on the viewer infuriating) when the characters are trying to make sense of who they are what theyre doing and what will or wont happen as a result -- none of which will mean much to a viewer coming in with no prior knowledge of the series. The movie does give us an enjoyably dumb crash course in time-travel specifics that explains how a ""nexus point"" can give rise to parallel timelines and alternate memories opening a narrative wormhole thats intended to justify the movies wholesale reimagination of its material. (Its roughly the same gambit J.J. Abrams pulled off albeit much more cleverly in his 2009 ""Star Trek"" relaunch.) In the refurbished ""Genisys"" timeline Judgment Day has been postponed from 1997 to 2017 the same year that Skynet plans to seize control via a spiffy new worldwide operating system called Genisys -- a twist that neatly updates the series techno-paranoia for the smartphone era. And so Kyle and Sarah make their way to San Francisco circa 2017 where Pops is now played by a conspicuously older and grayer-looking Schwarzenegger (as the film helpfully notes the hardware is willing but the flesh is weak). Amid this web of Silicon Valley intrigue they also run straight into John Connor himself who welcomes Mom and Dad with open arms -- and not in an altogether reassuring way. To summarize the plot further would risk inflaming the readers outrage and probably give all of us a massive headache. Suffice to say that in arranging this vaguely Oedipal family reunion ""Terminator Genisys"" aims to reset the entire franchise by eliminating John Connors revolutionary heroism as the narrative constant around which everything else must revolve. In eliminating this premise however the filmmakers dont offer much in the way of compensation The what-the-hell invention of the first half gives way to a growing sense of desperation in the second as our heroes find themselves running from one skirmish to the next while the baddies keep showing up and finding new ways to say ""You cant win"" before going up in flames. For his part Taylor orchestrates the action sequences with the same stolid proficiency he brought to ""Thor The Dark World"" whether hes staging a massive vehicular smash-up on the Golden Gate Bridge or filming the gleaming puddles of CGI that ooze from the Terminators rapidly mutating bodies. For all its initial playfulness the script never rises to the level of surreal cortex-tickling pleasure it seems to be aiming for and for all its self-awareness its weirdly devoid of humor. Even the possibilities of naked coed time travel -- and the potentially world-altering consequences of whether or not Sarah and Kyle hook up -- seem to evince more embarrassment here than amusement or pleasure. (The nudity like the violence is strictly PG-13.) What comedy there is unfortunately comes mostly from Schwarzenegger straining as ever to turn his utter humorlessness into a source of humor and at one point trying to add ""Bite me"" to the immortal ""Terminator"" lexicon. Still the star does what hes here to do -- namely imitate a lethal slab of granite and ensure a measure of continuity with the rest of the series -- even as he largely cedes the spotlight to Courtneys hunky earnestness Jason Clarkes unsettling intensity and Emilia Clarkes semi-successful attempt to channel the fire and grit of Linda Hamilton. It is on the face of it a ludicrous and faintly depressing spectacle like watching a ""Terminator"" highlights reel stiffly enacted by Hollywoods latest bright young things (which makes the appearance of J.K. Simmons all the more welcome in the minor role of a police detective). Yet while ""Terminator Genesis"" is far from a perfect movie it may well be a perfect product of its time and place one that ably reflects the ruthless economy of the industry in general and the thematic logic of this series in particular. The ""Terminator"" franchise by now has become its own worst Skynet -- a monument to self-regeneration that endlessly repackages the same old thrills in ever sleeker sexier models and that gladly screws with its own past to ensure its future survival.

Frank Smith says January 4 2016 at 921 am I suppose Im an exception to the rule as I NEVER liked T2. The franchise jumped the shark the second the Terminator became a good guy. And started cracking jokes. And that screeching kid? Imagine if the shark in Jaws started cracking jokes in the sequel. By so radically changing the story the films lost the core of menace so masterfully written in the first film and sent the scripts down a convoluted confusing rabbit hole trying to regain the plot and sense of tension that made the first film so successful. Now theres a trail of loud confusing and failed films left in the wake of what had to happen after T2. A funny good guy Terminator? Audiences overlooked the central theme being upended amidst the special effects metallic bad guy jokes and loud music. Now twenty four years later the writers are still trying to piece together a cohesive interesting storyline lost after T2. Reply maria says July 8 2015 at 219 pm Ignored your review and watched it twice. Seriously lighten up Reply Rodolfo Cabrera says July 5 2015 at 1045 am Terminator Genesis is a great movie. It is brilliant how Arnold Schwarzenegger made his come back to Terminator after being the California Governor. I was actually waiting for this come back. But I had doubts it was going to be this good. Here is what I like the most.. We all know how tough and one man show Arnold has been in the past movies.. Thus.. The great thing in Genesis is how Arnold humbles down himself to share the glory of his movie with Jai Courtney.. This is what I like the most. I like how Arnold acknowledge himself of being old already but still can shine "" I am older but not obsolete"" . To me this Arnold himself the Real Arnold saying that he still can be good but at the same time he understand that is time to let Jai contribute to the goodness of his movie. Arnold even plays funny he humbles himself to be that old man with fake open smile fake for the machine but I believe real from the Real Arnold. This is great movie I always admire Arnold I connect myself to him because I am a US citizen burn abroad also but I have been successful by studying and working hard just like Arnold. Reply Bobby says July 5 2015 at 251 am Definitely disagree with this review. I thought it was an enjoyable summer movie. Even pretty funny at times. Jai didnt work for me but Arnie and Emilia made up for it they had good chemistry. Reply failure says July 4 2015 at 1042 pm There is NOTHING clever about JJ Abrams Star Trek Reply Taylor says June 29 2015 at 1238 pm Glad to see the sequel to a classic movie series was left to the masterful hands of Alan Taylor who brought us the brilliant sequel ThorDark World... Im not a genius but I can tell the production company isnt exactly concerned here with giving us a worthy sequel or even a good movie. If you are going to make a sequel to a classic movie at least honor the prior work by giving the production team enough to work with to produce quality work. This is the problem with many sequels of course. Production companies dont give sequels enough money to make good movies because they are relying on the success of the former movie to bring in crowds of people. Thus high quality production isnt a priority in securing financial success... The terminator series was given to us by the great James Cameron and has now been left in the hands of someone who has directed two prior movies that were aweful. My question is this Why wouldnt Arnold Schwarzenegger demand the best production for this movie before agreeing to do it? I mean why would someone at his stage of life and career attach his name to a movie he knows is not being given the A production team treatement? Money plain and simple. And you as the consumer insure that movies like this will continue to get produced with untalented unseasoned uncreative and unworthy production teams if you go see this crap. Reply Wingsta says June 27 2015 at 1148 pm I saw an early screening of Terminator Genisys and thoroughly enjoyed it. No it wasnt as good as the first two but I thought it was better than the 3 and Salvation. And I didnt even mind Salvation. It seems more of the Summer Blockbuster the franchise used to be with its action and even bits of humor despites its kinks and all. Arnold did a little Qamp;A afterwards for the audience at the screening. I posted it in case anyone is interested. There is no spoilers in the video. Reply Michael Cookson says June 26 2015 at 220 pm This is a great moment to see out front out evil (Hells Angels) run our world. Hippie outfit and drug culture Calif Samp;M gay sex gay streetlights Vienna. World socialism Gestapo KGB homeland security. Runs calif into ground as Gov got Calif drought BP oil 1/3 human race ethanol and now upcoming MidWest drought to make sure hells angels fallen ones really stop the upliftment of mankind. Should rename this How Satan runs the world. Feels like Kennedy with Camelot with Meyer Lansky and Jack Rubenstein when Kennedy tried to oust Mafia and wouldnt support Israel. Got Allen Ginsburg gay sex Calif and Homeland Security. Reply David Hanson says June 27 2015 at 117 am Do the nurses know youre out of your room? Reply dan says June 25 2015 at 1112 am did I read that right? the writer saying the time travel divergence in star trek was better than this? Really? I am a trekkie but the newer films are hardly anything intellectual like voyager or next gen was whether this is good I will wait and see I didnt hold any torch for both JW and Max sequels but they both surprised me no end (in no way perfect but a good franchise addition). This as I read it seems more like picking on it than a review yes I hated the early connor reveal which im hopping is some kind of red herring but I will go watch this and make my OWN judgements Reply Bobby Hill says June 25 2015 at 1142 am Interestingly they have learned nothing because the T2 twist of Arnold being the good guy was also spoiled by the trailer. Reply TrueTerminatorfan says June 24 2015 at 745 pm T1 and T2 are masterpieces this looks like another crappy PG13 Terminator movie not watching it. Reply pm says June 24 2015 at 329 pm Just another Hollywood garbage to make a quick buck out of fools that buy into them. Reply Shell says June 24 2015 at 218 pm Note to writer you misspelled Genisys in the last paragraph of the article. You wrote ""Genesis"". Dont know what to think about the actual movie but I cant imagine it being any good without Cameron at the helm. The whole alternative timeline thing usually falls flat. On the fence about seeing it. Reply Johnny says June 29 2015 at 426 pm No it was the guy that came up with ""Terminator Genisys"" who misspelled ""Genesis"". Reply Gregory Zymet says June 24 2015 at 153 pm I saw Alan Taylors short film back at NYU (""That Burning Question"") and never forgot it. I wish hed create something personal and artistic again. He has so much talent and potential. Reply Liran says June 24 2015 at 1237 pm Why do you think that writing a review means telling us everything that happens in the movie? Reply Rex says June 24 2015 at 1219 pm Critics will never give a movie like this a good review because theyre too hung up on the age of Arnold. They do this with pretty much anyone who isnt 40 or under. When it comes to Arnold Stallone etc all they can talk about is the fact that theyre old. I cant wait until these critics hit 50 or 60 and then see how much people will crap on them simply for their age. Difference is at least Arnold and Stallone and actors like that made their mark and lived incredible lives. Old critics will just be left bitter and useless. Reply Johnny says June 29 2015 at 431 pm Last time I checked Edge of Tomorrow was critically acclaimed and Tom Cruise was 51 at the time so your argument is BS. Reply JOE S HILL says June 24 2015 at 1137 am Wouldve been greathad James Cameron directed his creationbecause with his ""touch""that sure wouldve made a HUGE difference-but unfortunatelythats water under the bridge nowsince hes locked with the second ""AVATAR"" moviefor which i seriously hope was worth the near five year wait as for ""TERMINATORGENISYS""i sure hope Paramount and Skydance makes this latest effort worth whilebecause despite some of the fan support with ""TERMINATOR SALVATION"" in 2009both thatand Jonathan Mostows ""RISE OF THE MACHINES"" in 2003were serious disastersand i hope that it doesnt extend to this current versionbut without Camerons directioni still dont give good odds on this movie-but well find outnext week Reply David Hanson says June 24 2015 at 1126 am I is confused.... Shouldnt Sarah Conner be about 60 years old by 2017? Also this is the first time Ive ever heard of the 2009 Trek referred to as ""clever"". Not a word I would use. Reply Bill says June 24 2015 at 353 pm How about brilliant? 2009s Trek was a spectacular and needed reboot of a franchise that had otherwise run its course. Reply David Hanson says June 27 2015 at 115 am But it made no logical sense A guys planet is destroyed so he goes back in time NOT to stop it or warn people but to get revenge on another guy who didnt stop it in the first place? What? Also the entire crew of the ship goes along with it. For twenty years. In all that time no one on that ship thinks to skype their grandparents and maybe suggest a summer home in the Delta Quadrant? Suspension of disbelief is a curious beast. I had no problem with tech that could burn completely through a planets crust from a low orbit (think of the power requirements) and I could even get past mysterious red goo (Macguffinium?) thats so destructive a cubic centimeter can destroy a planet of greater-than-Earth mass yet when they blow up a water cooler sized bottle of it does not wreck everything around for 12 parsecs. As I said no problem with all that but AN ENTIRE CREW of miners whove just lost their homes families legacies house pets etc. have a chance to stop it and....dont. Sorry. Cant hoist that with a forklift. Also what the hell was that business with the water pipe? S too bad too cause I like Eric Bana. Ever see Chopper? Good actor but he hasnt really had too many parts that let him shine. All this being said this was far from the worst Star Trek movie; that title is obviously still held by Generations. They did really well with casting and aside from overuse of lens flare and Dutch angles it looked pretty good. You could see the budget on the screen. And of course Into Darkness was pretty damn spectacular. JackBurton says June 24 2015 at 755 pm Spectacular at turning Star TREK into Star WARS. Both Abrams films were not exactly intellectually challenging or interesting as may of the TOS series episodes were. It wasnt Star Trek. Sorry. But many of the films were not either. Some very bad films with the label Star Trek were made. Abrams is a hack he hijacks others works because he is not capable of truly original creations. filmsharks says June 24 2015 at 1115 am Ill go see it simply because Emilia Clarke as Sarah Connor is a brilliant casting decision. Reply Johnny says June 29 2015 at 429 pm This is how the casting process for Terminator Genisys went Producer. I want that British green-eyed brunette that wears a blonde wig in Game of Thrones. casting director casts Emilia Clarke Producer No you dummy. I meant the one that already has experience playing Sarah Connor. I thought that goes without saying... Reply Rox Hart says June 24 2015 at 1113 am I enjoyed your review of this film only because you gave spoilers to a film franchise that has been one of my lifes greatest influences. I greatly look forward to this film and not expecting it to be a box office smash like the equally influential success of Jurassic World and Mad Max Fury Road. As a huge fan of all mentioned films and even bigger fan of The Terminator I assure you my 3D ticket is already purchased. Hollywood will continue to get my money no matter how confusing are lack luster they throw together these films as long as they in some way are giving us more to the story and keep them coming. Reply Charlie Hollinger says June 24 2015 at 1048 am J-Day is August 29th not October 29th. I guess this error just proves you have an unbiased opinion by not being a fan of the predecessors if nothing else. I just wish your article had a conclusion and less of a wishy-washy tone. Reply bijinius says June 24 2015 at 1042 am bummer dude. Reply Bob says June 24 2015 at 1028 am I read a lot of criticism of Terminator Salvation. I think it was the best one yet. I wish they had made Genisys like that one. Anyone else think that Salvation was the best one ? Reply Wayne Gleeson says June 26 2015 at 1055 pm You must be some kind of special if you think Salvation is the best one.. Reply Raven says June 24 2015 at 1252 pm Ya know in one of reviews they say opening future war scenes of John Connor amp; Kyle Reese going in battle with Terminators is actually better than entire Terminator Salvation simply because it was much more closer to Camerons future war scenes in T1 amp; T2. Reply pauliborn says June 24 2015 at 1109 am no never judgement day was the best one ) man I was ten by that time and alI I wanted was to be john connor riding a bike stealing easy money and a terminator that does what I want as new forsterdad... frack yeah But I give you that salvation wasnt bad at all and the mid movie twist was nearly haunting. I just didnt like batman as connor  well but terminator 3s connor was only ok at best and the new one? well we will see... kind of funny that the best john connor turned out to be such a dork that they had to recast him for every movie since than... although he always had the right age at the time they did a new movie. Reply nerdrage says June 24 2015 at 1027 am Another played out franchise. Hope it goes down in flames as a lesson to Hollywood if you must resurrect old franchises focus on ones like Blade Runner that have some juice left in them. Leave Alien alone too. Reply nathan says June 24 2015 at 1024 am Why do people keep saying this timeline reboot was done first by 2009s Star Trek?.... The Terminator TV show pulled this off before star trek but yet ignorant writers who arent fans of the universe keep acting like star trek was the first movie to rewrite a time line (the very first terminator movie was about rewriting time).... just irks me.... if Im supposed to believe that you know what youre writing about Reply warnerbrown says June 24 2015 at 923 am I read a bunch of reviews from the leaked script. All horrible. This seems to verify..and 3 sequels after T2. The idiots (ie producers/screenwriters) have done a fine job of butchering this to fucking death. Reply Todd S. says June 24 2015 at 916 am Regarding Terminator Genisys ""If you like the Terminator films -- youre going to love this movie."" -- James Cameron Enough for me. I cant wait to see it Reply chitown34 says June 29 2015 at 1129 pm A quick Google search will tell you he said that T3 was great too. His word means nothing because hes obviously trying to help Arnold promote the film since they are very good friends. This movie is going to be just as bad as the desperate trailers say they are. Any movie that would give away a twist as big as John Conner being a terminator in the trailers is obviously terrible and will do anything to get an audience into theaters before the bad word of mouth kills it at the box office. Reply Al Swearengen says June 24 2015 at 402 pm You do known that Paramount probably paid James to do that clip. Reply Ines says July 2 2015 at 623 am Doubt it or this would have been a very expensive clip. Brian Martin says June 26 2015 at 1254 pm He directed two of the highest grossing movies ever. He cant be taken advantage of that easily. LOL says June 24 2015 at 1254 pm Yes the CGI Cameron in this clip is very convincing. Reply Confused says June 24 2015 at 909 am So how was the movie? Reply Penguin says June 24 2015 at 857 am Ok so how many stars you give this movie? Reply atomic studio says June 24 2015 at 830 am will wait for it on netflix Reply JackBurton says June 24 2015 at 815 am Meh. Whats the point then? Not going. Better to see Fury Road again.
