While 2003s Somethings Gotta Give featured an angsty flustered Diane Keaton and a womanising Jack Nicholson this stars a slightly less angsty Meryl Streep who is flustered by her encounter with serial womaniser Alec Baldwin.The complication is that Jane (Streep) was married to Jake (Baldwin) - but he left her and their kids for other woman Agness (Lake Bell). Now Jakes on a nostalgia trip sweet-talking his independent ex into bed and a whole world of confusion. This may sound like unforgivably caddish behaviour but script and actor conspire to make Jake an attractive proposition with Baldwins charismatic arrogance and playful banter in full effect. Baldwin has terrific chemistry with Streep the pair seem to be having a genuinely hilarious time getting drunk and naked together - not that Jane will do that with the lights on. The script explores female insecurities and doesnt shy away from the realities of middle-aged sex Jake proudly displays his hairy beer belly on several occasions.You could watch this pair run around having a slapstick secret affair for hours. Unfortunately Steve Martin has to poke his head in as the Sensible Alternative and hes miscast. Martin is fine in comic scenes but as a romantic possibility hes unappealing. The inevitable conflict between the two men takes the film into more humdrum sentimental territory not helped by periodic appearances from Janes soppy grown-up children. Still Streep is as enjoyable as ever and if laughs count for anything this is one of the better romantic comedies of the season.

He is wonderful in this movie and so is Meryl Streep. I was also very taken with John Krasinski who is one to watch - he has funny bones. Not surer about Steve Martin and his strangely imobile face - not my idea of a romantic lead.

The same is true of aEURoeItaEUR(tm)s ComplicatedaEUR. ItaEUR(tm)s a very well scripted comedy that I suspect a 30+ audience is likely to find more amusing than younger viewers. I roared with laughter at StreepaEUR(tm)s coyness over showing her ex-husband her body while she was standing up as aEURoeThings have sagged a bit since you last saw itaEUR. There are plenty of other jokes that youaEUR(tm)d understand if you were of a certain age or older let alone if youaEUR(tm)re divorced/long term separated. Alec Baldwin is superb and IaEUR(tm)d forgotten what a good actor he is. Certainly thereaEUR(tm)s a spark between Alec Baldwin and Meryl Streep to rival the screen closeness she achieved with Stanley Tucci. The gags in the hotel room over his medications when the doctor is called is very good and possibly goes way over the head of younger audiences. StreepaEUR(tm)s reactions are classic. I found the casting and acting of the aEURoechildrenaEUR poor and likewise that of Steve Martin. (WhataEUR(tm)s happened to his face aEUR"" has he been to see Jocelyn Wildensteins plastic surgeon?)

Around two-thirds of the way through the previously tight script becomes woolly and not very funny where previously it was consistently amusing aEUR"" my fellow audience seemed to think so too with few laughs from that point. Did the scriptwriter get bored? Did he/she/they intentionally put all the gags in the first bit? Unfortunately I couldnaEUR(tm)t help feeling this film was rigidly following the aEURoe120 mins = perfectionaEUR formula.

Not too many twists or turns and not entirely predictable. I was pleasantly surprised given the awful trailer.

The premise is hilarious and Streep and Alec Baldwin carry on the affair for a while with extremely delightful consequences where streep shines like a diamond as she seems to be getting better and better with age . The relationships and interaction within an upper class suburban family with a divorce and three grown up kids is a comicsubtle pleasure where an intruder enters as steve martin in a very under -acted subtly humourous form . The movie has some of the best comic sequences with brilliant acting by Streep and Steve as they smoke dope and drive to a family date which is a must -see for everyone who likes class comedy . This is that rare piece of cinema where middle aged characters are given intelligent well sketched roles with an insight and it works on multiple levels as a social comment complex human behaviour and great entertainment .FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 9 2010Vicki BFeaturedIve just seen it and Id really recommend it to anyone who likes or can bear when dragged along to romcoms. This has a far better script than most and Streep amp; Baldwin are very good. Steve Martin looks weird and cant act (TO reviewer is right hes only good when playing for laughs) but the movie has some sharp lines good situations and is very entertaining. Sure its not a profound viewing experience its a romcom - but it captures certain aspects of modern life fractured families etc really well. NB Im middle-aged - if youre a teenager you might feel grossed out that such ancient people are being romantic. However when we saw it younger people were laughing and seemed to enjoy it too.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 8 2010MarsellusFeaturedGodfrey seems to have taken this film far too seriously. I thought it was great. Im not really into rom-coms but my girlfriend drags me to them on occasion. Anyway it was a feel good film with great acting from the three leads. I dont think it is supposed to be a realistic film - but romantic films rarely are. Is When Harry Met Sally realistic? Love Actually? Dirty Dancing? I think Ive made my point. Bottom line this film is an enjoyable way to spend two hours have a laugh and forget about real life.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/88191/its-complicated.html,200,it'scomplicated2,it'scomplicated,timeout

Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin star in ""Its Complicated."" Photo MELINDA SUE GORDAN UNIVERSAL PICTURES | ASSOCIATED PRESS Its Complicated 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Its Complicated claims the title but really it isnt. Exes boink. Thats it Two people who once made a habit of having sex together have sex together again. Its a tale that goes back to the ancients (or short of that Eminem) and most of the time there is no particular need to bring on the shrink for analysis. But thats what Nancy Meyers new film repeatedly insists on doing thinking about it. Blabbing about it (endlessly). And yes asking a therapist about it -- in a scene that actually doesnt do the profession any favors. The sum is a comedy that starts out slow and talky picks up speed -- and sexiness and hysterics -- somewhere in the middle then drags to a stop when everyone starts confessing their feeeelings (whoah-whoah-whoah) near the close. A movie thats one-third hilarious is better than no thirds at all but look at that cast Meryl Streep Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin. Doesnt that promise a somewhat larger fraction of laughs? Streep and Baldwin are on-again exes Jane and Jake Adler a long-divorced pair who get a smidge too amicable when Jake shows up minus his hot but emasculating trophy wife (Lake Bell) at their sons graduation. The leap from drunken giggles to post-coital awkwardness occurs in microseconds a breathtakingly fast transition that minimizes the spectacle of middle-age coupling for more sensitive viewers (though Baldwin bares most later on). Anyhoo so they have sex. In its aftermath amid the wrinkled sheets and muttered shock Jake acts dizzy with joy while Jane is devoured by guilt -- hes married and all. They keep news of their fling from their grown kids (Hunter Parrish Zoe Kazan and Emjay Anthony plus John Krasinski as a delightfully scene-stealing fiance) but Jane spills it to her girlfriends (among them Rita Wilson) in a tipsy confession scene with a large karmic twist. OK that does complicate matters a little. And the sweet dweeby architect (Martin) who rolls in as a third wheel He complicates things too. Writer-director Meyers whos devoted much of her career to midlife American arousal (Somethings Gotta Give) is so thoroughly fixated on exploring the ""issues"" that she loses her sense of fun. The hilarity that erupts in the middle portion hints at the film that might have been -- should have been -- with those three big charmers in the leads who earnestly shoulder the scripts heavier moments and explode with glee in its lighter ones. For the second time this year Streep finds herself in the kitchen concocting tasty French morsels (is the croissant recipe Julia Childs do you think?) but her performance flaps a bit -- its fussy and light-headed even before the introduction of mind-altering substances. Baldwin is bearish and twinkling like a large furry id; hes adorable as hell but just imagine him pawing through your backyard trash can. Martin meantime has a weightless ascetic quality -- a conscious restraint -- that pegs him as the movies superego. That leaves Streep as the ego I suppose. And I suppose theyll need a shrink after all. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Better Homes amp; Gardens Karachi Olefin Rug for 10 + pickup at...

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Theres a surprising fondness for the double negative in ""Its Complicated"" starring Meryl Streep Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin. Consider it a grammatical hint that things will get a bit messy. Which is precisely what happens in writer-director Nancy Meyers riotous and tender comedy about a middle-aged woman who has an affair with her ex-husband 10 years after theyve divorced. The first double neg comes as Jane (Streep) entertains friends played by Rita Wilson Mary Kay Place and Alexandra Wentworth. Jane is the lovely owner of a successful bakery in Santa Barbara. While ex-husband Jake (Baldwin) is married to a younger woman who has a little kid of her own Jane hasnt done much dating in the intervening years. ""Im not not doing it on purpose"" she says with a tight smile when the trio express concern over her ongoing drought in physical intimacy. This presumably common ailment of the single woman of a certain age will be remedied when Jane and Jake hook up in New York where they travel for their sons graduation. Jakes wife Agness (Lake Bell of the very taut abs) has stayed in California along with her terror tot Pedro. Her absence (and some wine) make Jake and Janes hearts grow fonder. Wham. Theyre having a fling. Whod a thunk it? Certainly not Jane. ""Its Complicated"" has a generous spirit. It teases the naughty (infidelity and a bit of pot smoking) and nice (the importance of being loving parents long after youve stopped being mates) with finesse. Martin arrives to make a crazed duet an intriguing triangle. Martin gently underplays Adam the divorced architect hired to add a long-planned addition to Janes house. His eyes squinch a lot suggesting the kind of sweet pain that comes when old heartbreak and new romantic possibilities converge. Baldwins Jake is just about the most appealing lout thats ever graced and (mildly) disgraced the screen. Divorce is especially complicated of course when there are kids involved. Jane and Jakes grown children are youngest Gabby (wide-eyed Zoe Kazan); graduating college senior Luke (Hunter Parrish of ""Weeds"") and eldest Lauren (Caitlin Fitzgerald). Burdened with a growing certainty that somethings up is future son-in-law Harley. ""The Office"" star John Krasinski is utterly winning as the newest family member. He approaches his new role with touching seriousness. And Jane and Jakes furtive shenanigans test his discretion and protective reflexes again and again. For classic hilarity theres a scene at a hotel where Harley and Lauren are planning their wedding as Jane and Jake rendezvous. Making us laugh in telling ways especially in a time-worn genre like the romantic comedy can be tough. Theres a reason for the saying ""Death is easy comedy is hard."" Meyers films -- from ""What Women Want"" to ""Somethings Gotta Give"" to the underappreciated ""The Holiday"" -- have consistently surmounted the challenges. Sure ""Up in the Air"" is the more ambitiously modern comedy. But this often hysterical romp has a Hollywood Golden Era ease. Simply put ""Its Complicated"" is a hoot. Who among us cannot not appreciate that? ""ITS COMPLICATED."" R for some drug content and sexuality. 2 hours.

Comments Its Complicated Free Rated R  118 minutes  2009 Nancy Meyers has become not just a writer-director but a brand after What Women Want (2000) and Somethings Gotta Give (2003) middle-aged women know they can count on her for undemanding relationship comedy that treats them with a little respect. Her fourth feature stars Meryl Streep as a mother of three grown kids and Alec Baldwin doing his usual cock-of-the-walk routine as her ex-husband who left her ten years earlier for a young honey but now decides he wants into her pants again. At first she welcomes their heavy-breathing trysts but then a more wholesome alternative presents itself in the form of Steve Martin badly miscast as a gentle lonely architect. The comedy approaches true hilarity only when Meyers resorts to the surefire gimmick of having the oldsters get massively stoned at a party though Streeps dilemma is handled well enough for the movie to accumulate some gravitas as it nears the two-hour mark.

Its Complicated Fair Director Nancy Meyers. Cast Meryl Streep Alec Baldwin Steve Martin. Rating Rated R for some drug content and sexuality. RELATED Its Complicated is simplified by Streep Baldwin Martin Spotlight Meryl Streep Which is doubtless not the sort of reaction Nancy Meyers who wrote and directed ""Its Complicated"" was hoping for. The movie isnt terrible but its certainly not great. Its meant as a look at the difficulties of middle-age divorce particularly sexual and emotional but its as soulless as the bland-but-extravagant world the characters live in - a world that looks as if it is furnished entirely from Williams-Sonoma and Pottery Barn catalogues. Jane (Streep) and Jake (Baldwin) have been amicably divorced for 10 years when they have a drunken-yet-passionate fling at their sons college graduation. Jane is mortified. But Jake whose trophy wife Agness (Lake Bell) is testing his patience (as is her demon-spawn son played by Emjay Anthony) is ecstatic. He figures theyre now a cant-miss proposition. All of the problems that led to their divorce - work pressure time away from the family etc. - are gone; they obviously have feelings for each other whats not to love? Well there was the affair he had 10 years ago. And the fact that HE IS STILL MARRIED. Details details. Meanwhile Jane is having an addition put on her already marvelous home. Adam (Martin) the architect in charge obviously has feelings for Jane but lingering trauma over his not-so-recent divorce has left him either patient or gun shy depending on your point of view. Jane and Jakes children have no clue whats going on but future son-in-law Harley (John Krasinski) does; his snide knowing remarks are some of the funniest bits in the film. ""Its Complicated"" is a by-the-numbers movie; its difficult to say whether the talent of the cast elevates the pedestrian material or makes the whole thing sort of sad. Streep is a genius; shes never going to be bad in anything. Baldwin is also a gifted actor and his Jake is probably the most-compelling character clearly disappointed in his current life and reaching out to Jane in equal parts passion and desperation. Hes also got a self-effacing streak occasionally commenting upon his status as a less than shapely fellow. Martin meanwhile soldiers on as Adam so incredibly even tempered that at times you want Jane to check him for a pulse. Its all very proper all very polite even when theyre getting stoned for the first time in a generation. ""Its Complicated"" is basically ""Wild Hogs"" for smart people big stars playing below their gifts in a crowd-pleasing movie. Audiences may purport to love it but they wont remember it for long.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + Officially ""Its Complicated is a Meryl Streep movie. As Jane a well-to-do baker and businesswoman having an affair with Jake her married ex-husband (Alec Baldwin) Streep deploys all her best moves. The pseudo-menopausal power-walks are here. So are the eye roll that could pull planets out of alignment and the sing-songy line deliveries. In other words shes in movie star mode and shes irresistible. But Baldwin achieves something not many men have been able to with Streep You notice him.Its fair to say that Baldwin has always been an asset to any movie (his ""I am God monologue in the 1993 thriller ""Malice deserves enshrinement in the great ludicrous movie-speech hall of fame). But ""Its Complicated unleashes an unabashedly desperately romantic side of Baldwin that we havent seen before. He doesnt steal this movie so much as grant all Streeps fluttering and twirling and hand-fanning an exuberant counterweight.Jane and Jake divorced 10 years ago. He married a younger harsher woman (Lake Bell) whom were meant to hate. The college graduation of Jane and Jakes son leaves them alone together in a restaurant. Fueled by what a montage of the evening suggests are 20 cocktails and 30 bottles of wine they wind up in bed together and the morning after launches the movie into all of its comedy.She rues the whole thing. But hes reborn. The look of deep satisfaction on Baldwins face is hilarious and for an American movie shocking - when has a man made that face after sex with any woman let alone one as senior as Streep? (Meryl you know what I mean.) If the movies need a new star its Baldwins middle-age executive type a man capable of having a good time in whats ostensibly a womans world. Hes does it every week on ""30 Rock the closest thing to Ernst Lubitsch and Preston Sturges that we have.Soon Jake is trying to get Jane to meet him for trysts which isnt easy for her since his adultery is what ended their marriage. But his certainty is persuasive. Baldwin might be harder to resist than Streep. Jake starts stalking Jane who just started dating the nice architect whos redoing her house. Baldwin spies the other mans car and does a crouching paramilitary run across Janes lawn to get a look at the competition. Its Steve Martin and one of the movies running gags is that Jane keeps forgetting he exists. Frankly so do we.At 52 Baldwin is porky. When he took off his shirt the night I saw the movie women in the audience gasped - and not in a Taylor Lautner way. But Baldwin has an alluring virile gusto despite the weight. Hes Rock Hudson trapped in Fred Flintstones body. The difference between him and all those sitcom fatties is that Baldwin doesnt seem constricted by his girth. When hes with Streep the sex and bliss come through She makes him feel like Rock Hudson. This is how you suspect his great ""30 Rock character secretly feels about Tina Feys traffic accident of a TV producer. But hes too well bred to go there. After this movie losing it for her would be both sweet and sort of embarrassing. Could the same man fall splat in love with Meryl Streep and Liz Lemon? Would you want him to?""Its Complicated was written and directed by Nancy Meyers who weve recently learned is the biggest woman director in Hollywood having scored hits with ""What Women Want ""Somethings Gotta Give and ""The Holiday which nobody saw in theaters but is now unavoidable on cable. Shes not much of a filmmaker but she is one of the very few directors to cast her gender in a literally flattering light. She doesnt know all women but gets a specific upper-middle-class one very well.This new movie is another batch of cute and broad strokes. Its also nauseating middle-age bourgeois porn. The characters talk about their rooms at the Four Seasons. At Janes restaurant the lentil salad with shrimp is 11.75. Someone drives a Prius and the music at a climactic house party thrown by a recent college graduate includes impossibly Leo Sayer and the Beach Boys. And where are those fabulous opening shots of the bluest water and the comeliest real estate perched on the cliffs just above it? Capri you say? Lake Como? Ha Its Santa BarbaraWatching some of the actors in Meyerss movies pop their eyes and make wild gesticulations youd swear shed cast Muppets in these parts. This time that honor goes to John Krasinski who plays Harley Janes older daughters fiance. Harley knows about the affair and whenever he sees Jane or Jake he spins around or waves his arms. Tall and thin hes a human exclamation point. But Meyers for once puts this kind of comedy to good use since Krasinskis older costars are foils for effective if undignified mugging.""Its Complicated is the most emotionally sophisticated of all Meyerss fantasies. Jane for instance is actually allowed to think about which man to choose. Its a no-brainer but Streep has a kind of wise forbearance that recasts the whole affair in a rational light. It flattens the ending. But you see where Janes coming from.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. For more on movies go to www.boston.com/movienation.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Meryl Streep heads back to the kitchen in ""Its Complicated"" this time making chocolate croissants onscreen. She shapes and flours the dough cuts and stretches and rolls it with precision as Jane the owner of an upscale bakery/restaurant. If only the craftsmanship in that cooking segment had been brought to bear on this film. Writer/director Nancy Meyers (""Somethings Gotta Give"" ""The Holiday"") never pushes for a hard truth when she can reach for an easy laugh. Shes like an industrial device stamping out 100 percent pure-plastic midlife female fantasy. Jane an idealized fiftysomething lives in a palatial empty nest. Long divorced from Jake (Alec Baldwin with a lewd twinkle in his eye) shes sending their youngest off to college. It looks as if home improvement projects and chablis with the girls is her lot in the golden years ahead. When she and Jake cross paths at a garden party and fall into a comfortable rapport each feels a forgotten spark. So the entanglements begin. As promised it gets complicated with a series of discreet hookups concealed from the Adlers incredulous kids and Jakes new wife Agness (Lake Bell) a hard-bodied young nuisance. Its not really adultery argues Jack (a lawyer natch) if theyve been married before. Jake falls in love with Jane all over again. Shes intoxicated with their easy old-school intimacy. As they rekindle the hearth fires Jane draws the attention of her shy architect Adam (Steve Martin) whos designing an addition to her home. Hes divorced too but less impulsive (and less fun) than the madcap Adlers. Jane likes his levelheadedness and doesnt like playing the other woman. Torn between the men she faces the decision of a lifetime. Well on paper anyway. Meyers never excites us emotionally or imaginatively. What sells ""Its Complicated"" is its comforting tame luxuriousness; clips of this film could be in-store promos for Crate amp; Barrel. ITS COMPLICATED  out of 4 stars Rating R for some drug content and sexuality. Meyers a screenwriter for years before becoming a director doesnt trust images to tell her story. Everything is made overexplicit. Jake cant just smile at Jane he must tell her over and over that she is mind-meltingly awesome. Jane cant quietly glow with satisfaction she must beam and flap her arms just a little as if she were trying to propel herself off the ground. Adam cant just lighten up a little after an impish hit of pot he must go full-tilt wild and crazy. A subpar film can become a hit if it offends no one and has a few outstandingly amusing scenes. There are several here. Baldwin is a good sport about being photographed in the buff and a sequence where he covers his vital parts with a laptop computer is as nicely done as anything in a Blake Edwards sex farce. John Krasinski supplies funny reaction shots as the Adlers prospective son-in-law working manfully to conceal his befuddlement at what he alone observes is going on. If you want to take your mother to a nice movie this weekend this is probably the one she will like best. Unfortunately theres not an honest minute in it.

(Universal) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday December 24 2009 551 PM Title Its Complicated Actually Hollywood its very simple If youre lucky enough to rope pros like Meryl Streep Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin into a formulaic comedy thats clearly beneath them you rise to the occasion. Nancy Meyers however has made no allowance for her mighty cast instead assuming that their mere presence will be enough to elevate ""Its Complicated."" And in a small way shes right Without them this generic rom-com would be nothing more than a winter time-waster. In truth an oddly bland Martin brings little to the farmhouse table at the center of this big-screen Better Homes and Gardens spread. He plays Adam the architect Streeps Jane has hired to redo her already adorable cottage. (No kidding Expect to experience serious house envy here. Kudos to the hardworking production design crew.) Before he unrolls his first set of blueprints Adams fallen for Jane a gifted chef and homemaker. But hes got unexpected competition in her ex-husband Jake (a delightfully sneaky Baldwin). Having recently reconnected at their sons graduation Jake and Jane are edging toward a full-blown affair. But they have to hide this romantic reunion from everyone including Adam Jakes wife Agness (Lake Bell) and their children. Subterfuge wont be easy Their son-in-law (John Krasinski) is already suspicious. Meyers direction is flat but its her sitcom-ish script that really undermines the cast. While Streeps desire to let loose is understandable its impossible for any actress to keep her dignity when forced to get high stuff her face with cake and giggle about ""poking smot."" And lets not even get started on the slumber party-style sex talks Jane and her girlfriends are required to snicker through. It was a great idea for Meyers to make a movie about midlife love. But why dumb things down to a level that would insult the average teen? Still Baldwin and Streep do make the most of the situation and their sparky chemistry provides the only real draw. Unless youre redesigning your home. In that case by all means go and bring an architect of your own with you.eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

(Melinda Sue Gordon) Enlarge Photo Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday December 25 2009 Some of the best -- and dirtiest -- lines in ""Its Complicated"" cant be printed in a family newspaper. Heck some of the best lines arent even lines. This StoryIts Complicated Young and funny at heartWatch Its Complicated trailerFind Its Complicated showtimes Instead theyre looks landed with the skill of a Chesley Sullenberger by two masters of comic acting in this very grown-up -- and very funny -- love story. The romantic comedy about a divorced couple having an affair manages to be both light on its feet and heavy enough to deliver something of a message. But more on that later. The masters in question of course are Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin. As Jane and Jake Adler -- 10 years divorced and with three grown children yet suddenly drawn back into each others lives (and beds) after a drunken fling over the weekend of their sons (Hunter Parrish) college graduation -- the stars pick up the movie and run away with it. The writing and direction by rom-com veteran Nancy Meyers (""Somethings Gotta Give"") are deft enough. But its Streep and Baldwins gamely ribald performances and their seemingly effortless effervescent chemistry that put the pep in this movies highly choreographed yet richly entertaining step. True to the films title Jane and Jakes affair is a little tricky made so both by the fact that Jake is remarried to a hot but hard-looking harpy played by Lake Bell and by the growing flirtation between Jane and Adam (Steve Martin) the gentlemanly architect whos redoing her house. Women of a certain age are going to love that. They wont know which is sexier that Jane is lusted over by two handsome suitors or that shes finally getting her dream kitchen. In other words theres two kinds of cheesecake being served here. The half-sexy half-comic kind exemplified by an all-but-naked Baldwin attempting to hide his considerable girth (and man parts) behind the flimsy screen of a laptop computer -- in one hilarious seduction scene that involves Martins character watching in horror at the other end of a video-chat screen -- and cheesecake of a more literal sort. Jane you see is a talented chef and owner of a bustling bakery-cum-coffeehouse and Meyers sets as many scenes as possible within its homey confines. There or in Janes casually elegant home kitchen around whose farm-style table shes often shown preparing food for her adorable brood which includes daughters played by Zoe Kazan and Caitlin Fitzgerald and a future son-in-law (John Krasinski never better). Now about that message. Ten years after her marriage failed food has become for Jane almost a surrogate for love. She uses it to bind her kids to her. She uses it to seduce Adam in a late-night bout of the munchies brought on by a pot-fueled party after which they passionately bake chocolate croissants together. And its one of the things that Jake misses most about his ex-wife (and that just might explain that considerable girth). ""I love it when you smell like butter"" he tells her in Baldwins trademark big-cat purr. In the end though we dont ever get to see the finished new kitchen. We dont have to. When Jane finally does find love -- and Im not going to say with whom -- its not because of whats in her hearth but in her heart. Food Network porn hot middle-age sex and a happy if slightly bittersweet ending. For a particular audience -- but not just for that audience -- whats not to love?  1/2 R. At area theaters. Contains lots of sexual humor scenes of drug use and a bit of crude language. 119 minutes. >> This StoryRead +|Watch +| Comments (c) 2009 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends Activity View More Activity  Young and funny at heart Find Its Complicated showtimes Watch Its Complicated trailer",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/24/AR2009122401092.html,200,it'scomplicated12,it'scomplicated,washingtonpost

(MCT) (Left to right) Jane (Meryl Streep) Adam (Steve Martin) Jake (Alec Baldwin) and Agness (Lake Bell) share a scene in the comedy ""Its Complicated."" (MCT) Photo Handout MCT Review Exes hook up in Its Complicated 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Its Complicated Comedy. Starring Alec Baldwin Steve Martin and Meryl Streep. Directed by Nancy Meyers. (R. 118 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Its Complicated"" really isnt. Exes boink. Thats it. Two people who once made a habit of having sex together have sex together again. Its a tale that goes back to the ancients and most of the time there is no need to bring on the shrink for analysis. But thats what Nancy Meyers new film repeatedly insists on doing Thinking about it. Blabbing about it (endlessly). And yes asking a therapist about it - in a scene that doesnt do the profession any favors. The sum is a comedy that starts out slow and talky picks up speed - and sexiness and hysterics - somewhere in the middle then drags to a stop when everyone starts confessing their feeeelings (whoah whoah whoah) near the close. A movie thats one-third hilarious is better than no thirds at all but look at the cast Meryl Streep Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin. Doesnt that promise a somewhat larger fraction of laughs? Streep and Baldwin are on-again exes Jane and Jake Adler a long-divorced pair who get a smidge too amicable when Jake shows up at their sons graduation minus his hot-but-emasculating trophy wife (Lake Bell). The leap from drunken giggles to postcoital awkwardness occurs in microseconds a breathtakingly fast transition that minimizes the spectacle of middle-aged coupling for more sensitive viewers. Anyhoo so they have sex. In its aftermath amid the wrinkled sheets and muttered shock Jake acts dizzy with joy while Jane is devoured by guilt. They keep news of their fling from their grown kids but Jane spills it to her girlfriends in a tipsy confession scene. OK that does complicate matters a little. And the sweet dweeby architect (Martin) who rolls in as a third wheel - he complicates things too. Writer-director Meyers whos devoted much of her career to midlife American arousal (""Somethings Gotta Give"") is so thoroughly fixated on exploring the issues that she loses her sense of fun. The hilarity that erupts in the middle portion hints at the film that might have been - should have been - with those three big charmers in the leads who earnestly shoulder the scripts heavier moments and explode with glee in its lighter ones. Streeps performance flaps a bit - its fussy and light-headed even before the introduction of mind-altering substances. Baldwin is bearish and twinkling like a large furry id; hes adorable as hell but just imagine him pawing through your backyard trash can. Martin meanwhile has a weightless ascetic quality - a conscious restraint - that pegs him as the movies superego. That leaves Streep as the ego I suppose. So I guess theyll need a shrink after all. -- Advisory Some drug content and sexuality.

One of them is her former husband. The other the architect drawing an addition to her Spanish colonial.Jane (Meryl Streep wistful) a fiftyish blonde with a sense of humor and of proportion may be the successful chef/owner of a Santa Barbara Calif. cafe but her personal life has been dormant since her divorce a decade ago. In the intervening years Jake (Alec Baldwin uninhibited) her faithless ex- and father of their three grown children remarried a thirtyish brunette and became father to a now school-age son.In New York for their own sons college graduation Jane and Jake find themselves in the same hotel the same hotel bar and then after a few bottles of red wine the same bed. With roses blooming again in her cheeks and the sparkle back in her eyes Jane attracts another beau back in Santa Barbara. Adam (Steve Martin subdued) is the architect hired to redesign as metaphor would have it Janes kitchen and her bedroom.Do we root for Jane to find that love is lovelier the second time around? Or for her to literally and figuratively rebuild a new life?As carefully styled as an Architectural Digest layout Its Complicated is less antic than prior Meyers comedies (What Women Want Somethings Gotta Give). The humor isnt bubbly its sticky. As a consequence except when the wily Baldwin and skittish John Krasinski (as Janes prospective son-in-law) are on screen the movie is more a chuckle-inward than laugh-out-loud affair.Meyers knows what women want the chastened playboy. And boy oh playboy Baldwin is as riotous as Mel Gibson and Jack Nicholson were in her previous hits. The hirsute Baldwin a knockabout motormouth who spends much time during the film unclothed resembles Porky Pig - only carpeted shoulder to groin in shag rug and ready to shag. Few things are funnier than a man of appetites indulging them all simultaneously.Does Baldwins boisterousness overwhelm Streep - or does the actress fail to establish her own tone and tempo? Their scenes together should bounce but more often than not they thud. They dont find each others live spots. Nor - except in a sequence where they smoke pot and go to a party - do Streep and Martin.Over the last few years with her richly deserved resurgence in The Devil Wears Prada Doubt and Julie amp; Julia Ive been convinced that Streep can do anything. But in Its Complicated as in Mamma Mia Streep giggles instead of making the audience giggle - a cardinal sin. (This is the comedy counterpart of the dramatic credo Dont cry if you want to make the audience cry. Its the withholding of the reaction that triggers the audiences reaction.)Nevertheless I enjoyed the spectacle of middle-aged people making spectacles of themselves. And I appreciated the films gentle understanding of how the romance of a parent affects the children. Its Complicated is simply enjoyable. As the proletarian Jimmy Stewart character observed in The Philadelphia Story ""Sometimes the prettiest sight in this fine pretty world is the privileged class enjoying its privileges.""Contact movie critic Carrie Rickeyat 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

Riding an elevator with her ex-husband (Alec Baldwin) and his new eye-candy wife (Lake Bell) Streep spots the garish tiger tattoo on the younger womans shoulder. Quickly almost imperceptibly she wrinkles her nose in a subtle gesture of displeasure. Movie Information Its ComplicatedRatingShowtimes | Official site | TrailerDirector Nancy MeyersActors Meryl Streep Alec Baldwin Steve Martin Lake Bell and John KrasinskiRun time 118 minutesMPAA rating R (drugs sexual content)Synopsis Meryl Streep Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin form a comedic love triangle.More movies from GuideLive.comIts over in a flash but that split second is enough to tell everyone whos in charge here. Its Complicated is likable enough and the sight of 50-somethings behaving badly is a welcome tonic for an industry that operates on the assumption that grownups dont exist. But this remains the Streep show from curtain to curtain a movie impossible to imagine without her presence.Jane (Streep) and Jake (Baldwin) have been divorced for 10 years long enough for their three kids to get used to the reality of separate households and amicable if awkward family gatherings. Then they go to New York for their sons graduation share a few drinks in a hotel bar and end up rekindling the old passion. Oops. Jake is re-smitten Jane is guilt-ridden and the shenanigans have commenced.Considering the setup Its Complicated doesnt have a whole lot of tension to milk. Writer-director Nancy Meyers (Somethings Gotta Give The Holiday) likes to keep things nice and pleasant and Janes other love interest a divorced architect played by Steve Martin is too milquetoast to make any real waves. But like its two ex-spouses the film manages to have some fun along the way often through the sheer will of its lead players.Baldwin is a little on the soft and cuddly side here; I prefer him in the smarm-shark mode of 30 Rock or as the corporate killer immortalized in Glengarry Glen Ross (remember coffee is for closers only). But every once a while the devilish glint will shine from his eyes and even when it doesnt Meyers has fun revealing a former hunk whos gone back for seconds a few too many times. Slapping his ample bare stomach in assertion his disarming lack of vanity proves hard to resist.Sneaking around smoking marijuana (Streep and Martin have a high time of it) creating comic mischief over Skype the core trio kicks around a harmless brand of trouble that belies their enviable material comfort. And these folks have it good. ""Im finally getting a real kitchen"" exclaims Jane early on and you have to pause and wonder Whats wrong with the current one? It looks like a Pottery Barn catalogue and has more space than most peoples apartments.But its hard to begrudge Her Merylness a new kitchen or anything else she desires. Its not just that shes aged well a no-brainer observation not just for ex-spouses. Her timing may be better now than ever before. Her ability to convey emotion through a single facial expression is unrivaled. For Streep as always acting is anything but complicated. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

Its Complicated High infidelity | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesIts Complicated High infidelityAdd another bang-on impression to Meryl Streeps canon - she does a stoner thats so convincing you wonder if the producers demanded she pee in a cup at the end of the days shooting.Alec Baldwin fans will have plenty to enjoy in his role as Jake who teams with Streep at her charming best as Jane Adler in Its Complicated.  (MELINDA SUE GORDON PHOTO)  By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. Dec. 24 2009 Starring Meryl Streep Steve Martin and Alec Baldwin. Written and directed by Nancy Meyers. 118 minutes. Opens Dec. 25. At AMC Yonge-Dundas and Rainbow Market Square. PG Add another bang-on impression to Meryl Streeps canon - she does a stoner thats so convincing you wonder if the producers demanded she pee in a cup at the end of the days shooting.Streep brings feisty charm to Jane Adler who is 10 years post-divorce from lawyer husband Jake (30 Rocks Alec Baldwin). Shes coping very well in the aftermath the late-50s mother of three grown kids with a thriving business running a chichi Santa Barbara Calif. bakery and restaurant.But shes often dateless and occasionally lonely living solo in her stunning hacienda. Unused vaginas can fuse shut her girlfriends warn her amid wine-soaked giggles around her farmhouse table.Article Continued BelowJake has moved on with far more speed. Hes married the darkly sexy and much-younger Agness (Lake Bell) the woman he was cheating on Jane with. But now shes nagging for a baby and things arent turning out quite like he planned.When Jane and Jakes paths cross amid much awkwardness at a medical centre (shes considering a brow lift hes exploring fertility options) little sparks of desire flare. They leap into a raging inferno after a boozy dinner at a hotel where the family meets up to mark their youngests college graduation.Suddenly Jane is no longer the dumpee - shes the other woman wrestling with issues of cheating on Agness with her own ex-husband. Jake grinning like the cat that ate the canary has no such reservations. He just wants to hustle back to the bedroom at every opportunity.Actually he wants more. Hed also like to get his feet under Janes table (he misses her croque-monsieurs) and wishes he could play daddy to his brood again.Enter sweetly shy architect Adam (Steve Martin) who Jane has hired to redo her kitchen. He might have plans for her beyond blueprints if Janes game.Ignore the fact the kitchen looks plenty amazing as it is by the way. This is Hollywood and Its Complicateds mission is delivering the one-two punch of meno-porn and kitchen-porn.Jakes full-court press to woo his ex is a comic jackpot for Baldwin fans. His Jake is crafty sentimental and charming-smarmy funny.While Jane daintily insists he turn around before she scurries out of bed lest he see her spreading backside Jake revels in his bountiful bod. He slaps his jiggly belly with relish and puffs out his hairy barrel chest stopping short of pawing the ground with joyful horniness.In an effort to keep Jake at arms length Jane agrees to an evening out with Adam hoping to ease first-date pre-party jitters with a few hits of pot. But this pair havent touched weed in nearly 30 years and instantly turn into giggling cake-scarfing maniacs.The subplots involving Jane and Jake sneaking around in an effort to hide their shenanigans from their kids add some chuckles but theres really nobody else onscreen but Streep and Baldwin thanks to their palpable chemistry.Martins role is smaller and calls on him to be more of a straight man but he shows hes lost none of his brilliant comic timing when the moment calls for it.And John Krasinski (The Office) has some amusing bits as the son-in-law who cant believe what hes seeing.Snappy dialogue and an up-tempo pop soundtrack add to Its Complicateds entertaining mix as director Nancy Meyers proves again that she has a deft hand with rom-coms. Somethings Gotta Give paired Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton in a similar setup but Its Complicated gets there with even more success.A rarity among Hollywood movies where senior sex is usually either an aberration or a punchline Its Complicated really isnt. Its just entertaining.

Crowd-pleasing wish fulfilment - thats easy Add to ... Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Wednesday Dec. 23 2009 410PM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 318PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Its Complicated Directed and written by Nancy Meyers Starring Meryl Streep Alec Baldwin Steve Martin Classification 14A Its Complicated is really very simple. Once again just as she did in Somethings Gotta Give  writer-director Nancy Meyers has given a middle-aged single woman everything her heart desires rewarding career terrific children fabulous house supportive friends financial independence and two successful men competing for her sexual favours. And the problem is? Well a woman already empowered to the nth degree struggles comically to reach the nirvana of n + 1 - thats the complication. This is wish-fulfilment fantasy where the laughs lie in sorting out an embarrassment of riches. In short Meyers makes crowd-pleasers. And if youre a dues-paying member of the crowd youll certainly be pleased. If not dont bother complaining because all the stuff that seems annoyingly contrived is a calculated part of the populist appeal. To carp about it is like dumping on a Walmart greeter - somebodys just doing his happy-face job. No doubt Meyers does her job pretty well. Shes a clever contriver adept at adding a patina of apparent relevance even a veneer of feminism to situations that are otherwise bogus and artificial. With that in mind meet Jane Adler (Meryl Streep) and prepare to go through her hearts-desire checklist. Yes shes got the satisfying job; shes got three kids all grown-up and wonderfully loving; oops shes only got a near-perfect house although a planned renovation of the kitchen will soon fix that tiny flaw; shes definitely got a nest of close friends and dont worry if you dont find the girl-talk hilarious - laughing uproariously theyre their own best audience. Now bring on the adoring guys with this twist - one of them is her ex-hubby Jake (Alec Baldwin). Ten years ago the bastard left her for the inevitable trophy bride but the trophy has dulled since. Now he wants back in the familiar fold of Janes familiar folds. Tipsy one night she tumbles has sex with him then runs to her shrink for validation frets about whether her motives are merely vengeful or more loftily self-fulfilling then tumbles again. Postcoitally arising from between the sheets Jane is shyly reluctant to display her naked wares. Alas Jake has no such compunction nor does Meyers about showing his mounds of hairy flab - visually its enough to give double standards a bad name. Adoring guy No. 2 is Adam the architect (Steve Martin) the brains behind her new ""dream kitchen."" Well Adam and his brains may lack Jakes brawny charm but he gets to deliver The Line the bon -est of mots that in movies past would always be spoken by lovely Miss May to lucky Mr. December. But here that clever Meyers puts The Line into a mans mouth when Adam says to his mature Eve ""Your age is one of my favourite things about you."" With that wish fulfilled Jane rewards his good heart with a time-honoured trip to his demanding stomach - damned if she doesnt bake him up a feed of chocolate croissants. The love triangle complete there remains only the teensy task of filling the rest of the rom-coms gaping two hours. No problem. Jake is the brunt of a Flomax joke at his piddling expense; the girls are reconvened for another session of hilarious talk; then Meyers really gets down to contrived business with one of her big set-piece scenes where attending their sons college graduation party its the oldsters who get high on some dynamite weed. Lest the crowd miss its laugh-out-loud cue Jane points us in the right direction when she exclaims ""Wow Fun isnt overrated is it?"" Thanks for the reminder. Streep issues it with the same giggly breathlessness that marks her approach to most everything here. This time out her talents enslaved by the material La Streep is content to narrow the performance to the role - both are forgettably small. By contrast Baldwin just bulls his way through the piece and the strategy proves not only wise but winning. His take on Jake an unapologetic old rogue as insouciant as his bladder is the one shard of honesty in the picture. Reduced to playing the straight man Martin simply disappears behind his squinty eyes conceding that when deprived of his usual mannered shtick hes got nothing left to offer. I lie.

Slightly less expensive-looking than James Camerons epic Nancy Meyers romantic farce ""Its Complicated"" is basically ""Avatar"" for women of a certain age with blond highlights replacing blue skin. This is a consumerist rather than an ecological fantasy with divorced empty-nester Meryl Streep plotting an addition to a La-La Land house slightly smaller than Grand Central Terminal while being fought over by remarried ex-hubby Alec Baldwin (funny) and architect Steve Martin (not). Yes it coulda had more laughs but in the spirit of seasonal good cheer let me predict that the best-chocolate-croissant-making montage in Hollywood history is going to help this one clean up at the box office. Reviewing movies like this makes me feel like the proverbial piano player at a brothel but I do have some advice for the guys. Encourage your significant other to make this a girls night out unless you find the idea of Baldwin posing nude for an unwitting audience during a Skype session the height of hilarity. Actually Baldwin -- in his first lead in a mainstream movie in 15 years -- is the funniest thing here as an unhappily married 58-year-old lawyer with a harpy wife (Lake Bell) trying to get pregnant and an obnoxious young stepson. A few drinks before their sons college graduation is all it takes to lure Streep -- who divorced him a decade earlier after he cheated with his now-wife -- into bed with this scuzzy character. Were told that Streeps character hasnt had sex in a very long time but it still takes every ounce of the acting skill that brought Streep a raft of Oscar nominations to make this remotely credible. This turn of events so shocks their silly grown children -- the son his two sisters plus an annoying wuss (John Krasinski) who appears to be romantically involved with one of them -- that they huddle in bed together for much of the movie. The screenplay by real-estate-porn specialist Meyers (""Somethings Gotta Give"" was better) is distantly derived from Noel Cowards classic farce ""Private Lives"" not that even his estates lawyers would want to take credit for it. Baldwins romantic rival is a recently divorced architect played by Martin. Perhaps the movies most unintentionally funny line comes when Streep (who runs an upscale bakery) looks at his drawings and exclaims ""Finally a real kitchen"" Its hilarious (except perhaps to the recently laid-off) because the kitchen she already has is bigger than most Manhattan apartments. Martin seems uncomfortable in this thankless role except when he and Streep cut loose in a reefer-smoking scene that got this otherwise innocuous comedy slapped with an R rating. Streep and Baldwin though seem to be thoroughly enjoying themselves -- perhaps more than those unwilling to suspend disbelief will -- whether theyre mugging slamming doors or yelling at each other. I left ""Its Complicated"" with one burning question How much did Bed Bath amp; Beyond have to pay Universal to get an Oscar winner to say its name in a line of dialogue? lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Tim Robbins Susan Sarandon relationship over Read Next Tim Robbins Susan Sarandon relationship over Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 35394 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 20778 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 18357 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

"Its Complicated | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; it-s-complicated ) Its Complicated (United States 2009) December 23 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli For Nancy Meyers whose Hollywood career began with screenplay and producer credits for Private Benjamin and whose first stint behind the directors chair occurred in 1998 with the Lindsay Lohan remake of The Parent Trap (back when Lohan was still a rising child star and not a tabloid sensation) Its Complicated illustrates how far she has come. Able to call her own shots and attract the best talent available in Hollywood she has crafted a motion picture that does justice to both aspects of the ""romantic comedy"" genre. With a story that by turns defies and adheres to formulas Its Complicated ends up being one of the end-years best sources of pure entertainment. And for those who believe laughter is the best medicine theres more than a bellyful or two to be found here. The romantic comedy convention is to focus on a man and a woman who are destined for one another. During the course of the movie theyll occasionally pull apart only to have fate push them back together. They are after all Cupids pawns. Many films will introduce another male character whose purpose is to provide the dreaded ""romantic obstruction."" He may seem to characters trapped in the movie to be a reasonable alternative but viewers know better - hes just a bump in the road. Its Complicated provides us with these staple characters. Theres the woman divorced cook Jane (Meryl Streep) who has finally cleared the last of three children out of the house and is getting ready to build a dream kitchen addition onto the main building. Theres the man Janes ex-husband Jake (Alec Baldwin) who is re-married yet finds himself yearning for the one true love of his life. Theres the obstruction architect Adam (Steve Martin) a nice guy whos supervising Janes construction project. But waita| maybe its the other way around. Maybe Adam is the man and Jake is the obstruction... Its all very complicated. And thats just the way Meyers wants it. Unlike with 90% of the romantic comedies out there the goal is for the viewer to be unsure with whom Jane will cuddle as the end credits approach; Meyers wants us to see the good in both candidates. When Jane is with Jake we want them to wander off into the sunset arm-in-arm. When shes with Adam its difficult to imagine her being with anyone else. I cant recall the last time I didnt know the identity of the eventual partner long before the approach of the end credits. For the most part Its Complicated is smartly written. One could argue the people are a little too self-aware but that quality doesnt bother me - these are movie characters not my next-door neighbors. Thats not to say there arent problems. The three adult children are arguably too well-adjusted for kids who grew up in the shadow of the massive dysfunction of their parents marriage. The scenes between Jane and her female friends (played by repeat offenders like Mary Kay Place and Rita Wilson) contain cringe-inducing dialogue. Its as if Meyers invited Nora Ephron (circa 2009 not back when she was writing clever stuff like When Harry Met Sally) on board to scribe these scenes. They are trite and damage the films smooth flow. The best thing about them is that there are only two and neither lasts inordinately long. The importance of good acting emerges when one considers the three legs of the romantic triangle. The average romantic comedy features photogenic actors who are somewhere between puberty and the legal drinking age. Streep is 60 Martin is 64 and baby-faced Baldwin is 51. Typically one does not populate a genre entry of this sort with such old geezers. But as was the case in Somethings Gotta Give it works. The performances are unforced and the chemistry abundant; it doesnt matter that none of the stars have flawless skin and tight butts. For the most part these actors dont upstage one another; theyre giving. Even during Baldwins big full moon scene Martin and Streep are given reaction shots that get laughs. For the most part the members of the supporting cast do what theyre supposed to do which is to get out of Streep Baldwin and Martins way. The exception is The Offices John Krasinski who plays the soon-to-be-husband of Jane and Jakes eldest daughter. Krasinski is a master reactor and he has some priceless moments. Meyers avoids overusing him. For the most part Lake Bell is forgettable as Agnes Jakes current wife although her final appearance features an effective close-up that speaks volumes. Perhaps no other working director can get as much humor out of the naked human body. Meyers provoked big laughs when Diane Keaton disrobed in Somethings Gotta Give. Here its Alec Baldwins turn. The scene is so hilarious that you wont hear a line of dialogue - the rest of the audience will be laughing too loudly. Its Complicated features something increasingly rare in romantic comedies most of the jokes work. Theyre funny. And you wont feel embarrassed for having laughed at them because you wont be the only one in the theater doing so. Its Complicated represents Meyers most accomplished work to-date and is a substantial upgrade over The Holiday. (To be fair that movie imploded in part because of the grotesque miscasting of Jack Black as Kate Winslets love interest.) Meyers unapologetically writes from a womans point-of-view and that quality makes her movies refreshing. She doesnt provide the same warmed-over clichA(c)s that dominate male-fashioned movies of this sort. Its Complicated isnt perfect and the ending may be a little low-key for some to appreciate but it provides as engaging a two hour period as Meyers has ever been responsible for and is a tonic for those weighed down by the seriousness of ""important"" would-be Oscar contenders.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 23 2009 458 PM The Goo Layer Its Complicated is too cute but also highly enjoyable. By Dana Stevens After youve seen Its Complicated simplify things by checking back in with our Spoiler Special discussion You can also download the program here or you can subscribe to the Spoiler Special podcast feed via iTunes or directly with our RSS feed. I cant seem to bring myself to hate Its Complicated (Universal Studios)as much as Im supposed to. This is the kind of film that critics tend to reflexively dismiss as sticky-sweet fluff or bourgeois wish-fulfillment. The latter accusation is tough to deny Rather than kitchen-sink realism Its Complicated traffics in kitchen-sink fantasy. Much of the plot hinges on Meryl Streeps characters long-held dream of building herself a new kitchen one that would replace the entirely perfect kitchen she has already. But just beneath this movies gleaming high-end surfaces beats the heart of a classic screwball comedy. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Streeps character Jane Adler is a professional pastry chef and mother of three grown children who lives in a gorgeous house in the gorgeous coastal town of Santa Barbara Calif. Ten years ago her husband Jake (Alec Baldwin) left her for a much younger woman (Lake Bell). On a trip to New York for their youngest childs college graduation Jane and Jake bump into each other both alone at the hotel bar. They awkwardly agree to have dinner together have way too much to drink (were talking Bukowskian quantities--by my count two cocktails apiece plus three shared bottles of wine) and wind up in her room having drunken passionate and extremely ill-advised sex. Jane wants to write it off as a one-time mistake but after their return to California she finds herself embroiled in a full-fledged affair with her immature needy but irresistibly charming ex. Meanwhile Adam (Steve Martin) the buttoned-up architect charged with building Janes unnecessary new kitchen (seriously could she at least be short on counter space? Something?) is quietly courting her as well but his discreet gestures of affection keep getting eclipsed by Jakes grand-scale buffoonery. Advertisement All this is thoroughly ridiculous of course but when Streep and Baldwin are on-screen its delightfully so. As a couple with a long checkered history and a shared gift for banter theyre as believable as Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant in The Philadelphia Story or William Powell and Myrna Loy in the Thin Man movies. Fine the banter itself isnt always up to George Cukor level but its not dumb either and these two actors utterly relaxed and in the groove make the modest laughs and insights seem like something more. What Baldwin does with his character is especially smart. As written Jake is a fairly standard movie ex-husband a well-meaning but self-absorbed bumbler who cant keep details about his childrens lives straight. But Baldwin invents unexpected bits of business that make you understand why Jane has such a hard time letting go of her ex. Jake is a drama queen who gets tears in his eyes at a moments notice and moans with pleasure when he eats good food. He makes gestures that are at once obscene and strangely romantic like grabbing his ex-wifes crotch after lovemaking and murmuring ""Home sweet home."" Everyone whos managed to make it to their fifth decade has an ex like Jake the person who makes you laugh like no one else but whom you just cant manage to make a life with. The scenes late in the movie when Jane and Jake sort through the implications of their dalliance and debate the possibility of a future together are genuinely affecting above and beyond the call of duty for a movie this lightweight. There are a few moments of decently staged whos-behind-that-door sex farce like a scene when Janes daughters fiance (John Krasinski more than holding his own among these big comic talents) spots his future mother- and father-in-law furtively checking into a hotel for some afternoon delight. A scene in which Streep Martin Baldwin and Krasinski all smoke pot at a house party is pure joy nothing like the ageist ""old folks get high"" cliche that description might suggest. (For painful ""old folks get high"" moments on film this year see Taking Woodstock and Transformers Revenge of the Fallen.) As a director Nancy Meyers has a bad case of the cutes. She punches up scenes unnecessarily with perky music and lingers way too long over a montage in which Martin and Streep have fun baking chocolate croissants together. (Just one costume improvised out of croissant dough would have been plenty.) Its Complicated seems at times to be obscured by a layer of caramelly goo that if you could just scrape it away would reveal a sharp story and characters underneath. This goo layer is the kind of thing that gives chick flicks a bad name. I reject the logic by which middle-aged female wish fulfillment at the movies deserves only our scorn while adolescent-boy wish fulfillment is worthy of adulation. But if Meyers had dialed back the schmaltz (and the envy-inducing shelter-mag production design) by about 20 percent she could have made the romantic comedy of the year.

ABOUT THE MOVIEIts Complicated  (out of four)Stars Meryl Streep Alec Baldwin Steve Martin Lake Bell John KrasinskiDirector Nancy MeyersDistributor Universal PicturesRating R for some drug content and sexualityRunning time 1 hour 58 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Nancy Meyers director of 1990s What Women Want appears to have taken that title as her mantra. Everything about her movies falls under the category of wish fulfillment specifically pertaining to middle-aged women. She does occasionally deliver up some clever lines but Its Complicated is vacuous overall although attractively packaged. MORE A sit-down with Streep Martin and Baldwin Meyers last films -- 2006s The Holiday and 2003s Somethings Got to Give -- focus on thriving career women living in gorgeous homes sans romance. This particular brand of rom-com has become Meyers stock in trade. TRAILER Watch a clip Meryl Streep stars as Jane a divorced fiftysomething with a successful Santa Barbara bakery/restaurant. She lives in a stunning Mediterranean-style house has three loving grown children and a circle of caring friends. Alec Baldwin plays ex-husband Jake an attorney who zips around in a shiny black Porsche and is married to the much younger Agnes (Lake Bell). We learn that Jake left Jane a decade earlier but his new union is faltering. Sure Agnes looks like a supermodel but she lacks the grace of the charming wise and nurturing Jane. As anyone who has seen the billboards or ads knows the former spouses wind up together between the sheets. Jane is conflicted about their trysts and also is drawn to Adam (Steve Martin) a genial divorced architect. The film makes a few incisive observations about divorce and midlife sexuality peppered with mildly dark humor. But it stops short of being revelatory and lacks clever banter. With sharp comic talents like Streep Baldwin and Martin you would expect something funnier edgier and smarter. Streep acts flustered Baldwins dialogue are variations of ""hubba hubba"" and Martin is the quintessential nice guy. There is some silly fun such as a scene in which Jane and Jake meet at a hotel for a liaison and are spotted by their daughters fiance (John Krazinski). But most of the movie is predictable. Meyers uses musical montages and shoots the principals doubling over in laughter in place of crafting witty dialogue. Escapism has its place at the movies but something this slick is like a lavishly wrapped but empty Christmas present.

His understatement is of a piece with the rest of Guy Ritchies film which twists stretches knots tangles distorts bleaches smudges and sometimes tears the very fabric of Arthur Conan Doyles Victorian canvas. The Holmes of this action adventure played by Robert Downey Jr. is a master of the martial arts and perfectly capable of brutal behavior when its required of him by the brutishness of a black-and-brown London that recalls ""The Elephant Man."" The movie as a whole is clever and conspicuously overwrought. But Mr. Downeys performance is elegantly wrought; hes as quick-witted as his legendary character and blithely funny in the lovers spats--all right the mystery-lovers spats--that Holmes keeps having with Jude Laws witty Dr. Watson. ENLARGE Jude Law as Dr. John Watson and Robert Downey Jr. as Sherlock Holmes Warner Bros. The director made his name with contemporary comedies about whimsical casually violent thugs so its no surprise that he pays more attention to the underworld of Holmess time than to the milieu of the haughty hero. He and his writers--four of them get credit for the script--have closed the gap between hunter and prey. This Holmes has been dehaughtified to say the least. Hes unkempt even scruffy and a pack rat who looks a little cracked. Still his intelligence is intact. Its on display most vividly in a restaurant scene when Holmes makes a series of ruthlessly accurate deductions about Watsons lovely fiancee--shes played by Kelly Reilly--and in several quick-cut sequences that deconstruct the detectives mental processes. The villain Blackwood is played by Mark Strong the excellent actor who played a Jordanian security chief in ""Body of Lies."" While hes impressive here the fruits of his evil genius are less so. The four writers in question have concocted a plot that promises to be diabolical (a satanic rite for openers with a begowned beauty about to be tortured) but grows silly in inverse proportion to its grandiosity (a doomsday machine designed to do in the House of Lords) then finally performs a peculiar act of self-deflation by revealing that Blackwoods seeming magic was only a succession of conjuring tricks. And its hard to follow let alone care about the comings of goings of Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) a criminal who has bested Sherlock Holmes in the past but is worsted by the scripts convolutions. Doyle had ambivalent feelings about his Sherlock Holmes stories and books; they were spectacularly successful but not the kind of art he aspired to. Ambivalence is appropriate here too not because Mr. Ritchie has violated a venerable literary icon by turning him into an action hero--kids will probably buy into the notion and whats the harm?--but because the movies kung fu conniptions are far more mundane than the settings in which they play out. The truly distinctive physicality comes less from the familiar fight sequences than from Sarah Greenwoods set design and Philippe Rousselots cinematography complemented by computer-generated visions of a Victorian London simultaneously moldering and exploding with new construction. And even though Mr. Downey has emerged from ""Iron Man"" as a full-fledged action hero its great fun to watch him do the detective work he always does finding laughs and bright surprises in every scene.  It isnt hard to imagine a Gallic knock-off of ""Its Complicated"" played as shallow stylish farce. Ten years after her divorce Jane a middle-age mother of three crosses paths with Jake her ex-husband and his young sexy wife. Unexpectedly Jakes love for Jane rekindles and they have a passionate affair forcing Jane to choose between being her exs mistress or her own woman which she thought she had been all along. In this original American version the filmmaker Nancy Meyers plays it as a comedy with lavish trappings--the setting is mostly upscale Santa Barbara--but a comedy about real feelings deep confusions old regrets and the yearning of those no longer young for a new lease on life. After listening to Jane and Jake talk it out in the interminable process of working it out--they explore their relationship as exhaustively and exhaustingly as any kids on Facebook--I found myself wishing for more shallows and fewer depths. ENLARGE Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin in Its Complicated. Melinda Sue Gordon Thats unfair to Meryl Streep who portrays Jane with infectious humor. Shes endearing when she announces cheerfully ""Im a bit of a slut""; when she says to Alec Baldwins Jake ""Youre an adulterer and I am . . . an awful person basically"" (we know shes not) or when she begs her shrink for permission to pursue the affair and thanks him with a youve-given-me-such-a-gift gesture when he simply allows that it cant hurt. And even though Ms. Streep looks radiantly lovely at the age she is she makes her characters vulnerability both funny and touching in a bedroom encounter during which Jake will see Jane standing naked for the first time in a decade. But its also unfair to ask Ms. Streep as the movie does to sustain vitality and spontaneity in the midst of serial contrivances--smoking a joint using a Web cam to disastrous effect talking ritual talk about food and home improvement. (Jake himself is a contrivance though Mr. Baldwin mostly manages to make him a likable one.) Steve Martin plays an architect who wants to bring true love into Janes life. Zoe Kazan is sweetly quirky as the divorced couples younger daughter. Lake Bell fails to find a scintilla of humanity in Agness Jakes icy young wife but John Tolls cinematography compensates for that and a lot more by bathing the production in a soft and welcome warmth.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet With Somethings Gotta Give and the new Its Complicated writer-director Nancy Meyers has cornered the market on poorly titled dramedies about revitalized older women finding love after menopause. Both films are shrewdly and even cynically calculated to some extent aggravated further by Meyers habit of backing away from thorny dramatic situations with broad pandering stabs at crowd-pleasing humor. (Its Complicated should really be Its Far Less Complicated Than It Initially Appears To Be but that wouldnt solve her title problems.) But say this for Meryl Streep Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin Theyre professionals and their relaxed chemistry and good humor together carries the film surprisingly far doing a lot to confirm Meyers wish-fulfillment fantasies about life beginning after 50. Leaning on the natural effortless ebullience of her performances in Defending Your Life Mamma Mia and A Prairie Home Companion Streep is immensely appealing as a divorced bakery owner and chef whos about to be an empty-nester. Alec Baldwin plays her ex-husband who left her 10 years earlier for a much younger woman (Lake Bell) and fully realizes that hes a walking cliche. The exes already share a genial relationship but between Baldwins frustration with his current wife and Streeps pangs of loneliness old feelings are quickly rekindled. But when Steve Martins divorced unattached architect competes for her affections too the situation gets problematical. Or tricky. Or convoluted. Or some such synonym. Though Meyers soft-pedals the betrayal part of their affair--the scene where Martin discovers the truth is so misconceived it nearly ruins the film--Streep and Baldwin get the illicit thrill of it just right. Theres something old and something new in their time together a sense of falling into familiar rhythms while also discovering each other for the first time. Baldwin importing his devilish grin from 30 Rock proves very persuasive and Streep as a sensualist by trade cant help but be persuaded. Her milquetoast relationship with Martin is less convincing because what she gains in comfort she loses in spark. Its Complicated is the sort of ""mature"" character piece the French do regularly and better (and without the need for quotation marks around ""mature"") but the cast at least helps relieve some of the tidiness that belies the title.

The thought ran through my head not very long into Its Complicated Meyerss biennial stocking-stuffer about the romantic trials and tribulations of obscenely privileged and narcissistic Southern Californians. Once more into the breach goes Meyers to show us what women really want this time with Meryl Streep as a Santa Barbara restaurateur ""of a certain age"" faced with a smattering of life-altering crises the fading of her youthful visage; the empty nest as her youngest child departs for college; and in willful defiance of the down economy an impending addition to her already enormous home. (But wont that make her empty nest emptier?) She is also like most of the female protagonists in Meyerss films a highly strung self-pitying sex-starved nag defined expressly by the men in (or out of) her life despite her resolve to be an independent woman. Its complicated indeed.Not that Meyers--a global brand whose films have surpassed 1 billion at the worldwide box office--is particularly more charitable (or honest) when it comes to her male characters who are on hand mainly to act like pigs usually by ignoring radiant women of their own age in favor of hot-to-trot chippies only to belatedly realize how good they had it in the first place. Nothing if not an ""auteur"" Meyers spent most of the 80s and 90s married to the filmmaker Charles Shyer with whom she collaborated on the comedies Private Benjamin Baby Boom and Father of the Bride and its telling that the solo features Meyers has made since their divorce (What Women Want Somethings Gotta Give) have increasingly felt like poison-tipped valentines to her former partner. (Meanwhile as if to complete the cliche Shyer struck out on his own with the 2004 remake of Alfie starring Jude Law as a cockney cock-of-the-walk who treats women like Kleenexes.)In Meyerss most thinly veiled work of self-portraiture to date Streeps Jane Adler has been sidelined by her philandering lawyer ex Jake (a puffy Alec Baldwin giving a ham performance and looking like one too) in favor of the thirtysomething Agness (Lake Bell) who in the natural order of the Meyers universe is a ball-busting gold-digger eager for Jake to sire her child. (Cut to fertility clinic waiting room jammed wall-to-wall with similar May-December ""romances."") When Jake and Jane cross paths at their sons New York college graduation it isnt long before they fall back into each others arms--and into bed--while Meyerss shopworn comic tropes fall into place naked fiftysomethings examine their flab and contemplate plastic surgery; naked fiftysomethings feign horror at the sight of fellow naked fiftysomethings; naked fiftysomethings have heart failure during foreplay. And just for good measure everybody must get stoned.Watching this garish fiasco (little helped by the flat stolid cinematography that has become the norm for American screen comedy) I found it mildly depressing to see Streep a spry comedienne in the films of Albert Brooks and Spike Jonze hurdling through this gauntlet of strained whimsy her every toothy smile and throaty chortle more affected than Sophie Zawistowskis Polish accent. That was before I realized that Janes soft-spoken silver-haired divorce architect Adam was being played by none other than the live-wire Steve Martin in what may be the most anesthetized emasculated performance he has ever given. (The Cheaper by the Dozen franchise is a movable feast of comic invention by comparison.) Then I was really depressed.In her last picture The Holiday Meyers littered the dialogue (and the title) with references to the classic Hollywood screwball comedies of the 30s and 40s--a tradition to which she clearly sees herself an heir. In Its Complicated she doffs her beret to the Gauls by having Jake remark that his and Janes fling is ""very French of us"" shortly before Adam calls up and invites Jane to a French film festival. Mais non If the French Meyers admires so much made a farce about two ex-spouses having an affair--and surely they have by now--the characters wouldnt be drawn in such robust caricature the screenplay riddled with such reductive assumptions about the battle of the sexes. Certainly the ostensible heroine wouldnt be forced to choose between an unapologetic cad and a veritable eunuch.In a key moment of Its Complicated Jane frets over a gourmet dinner for Jake only to have him stand her up. Cue montage of a forlorn Streep wrapping up leftovers and blowing out candles. Meyers supplies a reason for Jakes absence but the real explanation is this She wouldnt know how to write the scene in which he actually shows.

And that audience gets what it wants within the first 10 minutes of Nancy Meyers blithe self-regarding fitfully charming paean to the fairy-tale luck of middle-aged women wealthy enough to maintain a delightful standard of living after a divorce. As the movie opens Jane Adler (Streep) attends a sun-dappled outdoor party where she runs into her ex-husband Jake (Alec Baldwin) with his much younger second wife Agness (Lake Bell). Divorced for a decade the Adlers are on enviably pleasant terms even as Jane in the artful draped wardrobe of a fleshy fiftysomething casts a rueful look at the second Mrs. Adlers toned and flaunted bare midriff; after a 19-year marriage Jane and Jake have the kind of easy irreplaceable shorthand of intimacy that doesnt dissolve just because their union has. Finally Jane leaves solo and returns to her picture-book Santa Barbara home. She walks into her magazine-layout kitchen. And no joke the audience goes ooooh. Look at the gleaming copper pots hanging from a ceiling rack (wheres my Williams-Sonoma catalog?) Look at the bowl of luscious magenta plums (must stop at Whole Foods) Ogle that sexy long farm-style table made for complicated cooking and convivial eating (Crate amp; Barrel? Nah must be something custom-made) Get a load of that stuff Its Complicated is middle-aged porn the specialty of Meyers ? who also set ladies and interior ? decorators drooling over homes and gardens in 2006s The Holiday. Specifically the movie is middle-aged femme porn. Not that theres anything wrong with that au contraire but lets understand one another This is a fantasy about a triumphant ex-wife desired all over again by her ex-husband. And for icing on the gateau shes admired by a second cute successful eligible man too?played by Steve Martin no less This is the stuff of Santa Barbara book-group literature. Streep plays an icon of an accomplished radiant woman. (She runs her own bakery/restaurant; at one point she actually bakes chocolate croissants on screen probably using a recipe handed down from Julia Child.) Baldwin draws on his bank account of viewer love for his brilliant work on NBCs 30 Rock to play a rich assertive lawyer -- part chunky hunk part Jack Donaghy. And when the two check in to the same New York hotel while attending the college graduation of their son (Weeds Hunter Parrish) wine and reminiscence lead to a night of mind-blowing sex. (As is her prerogative the awfully game Streep is mostly covered up; as is his the awfully pained-looking Baldwin is often bared.) Waiting in the wings meanwhile with gentlemanly patience is Martin as Adam an architect hired to make Janes kitchen even bigger and more beautiful. Divorced himself two years earlier Adam is a cautious catch; hes more fun when he and Jane share a naughty hit of marijuana. Streeps Jane giggles a lot -- either the expression of her joie de vivre or else a tic. She giggles with Jake and then with Adam and then with Jake again. She giggles with her adult children youthful beauties out of a Garnet Hill catalog. John Krasinski pitches in as Janes empathic son-in-law-to-be and she giggles with him too. Meyers who wrote this original screenplay throws in a few cheap up yours Hollywood wives zingers just for fun. Jane visits a ? cosmetic surgeon for a consultation then flees in outrage. (Surely no mature actress in this movie has had a consultation right?) Jake is observed with his pants down at a fertility clinic nagged to duty by the relentlessly unappealing Agness. These gratuitous mean moments are parts of the porn too I realize. But theyre the dull parts. On DVD Meyers audience will fast-forward to the next hot scene featuring a naked copper pot.

Meryl Streep continues the foodie phase of her career in ""Its Complicated"" a cloying self-satisfied occasionally funny farce about an extramarital affair between formerly married fiftysomethings. Writer-director Nancy Meyers latest survey of the travails of the rich and pampered boasts a clever central premise and an enjoyably self-effacing comic turn by Alec Baldwin. But Streep playing the best cook to hit Santa Barbara since Julia Child died there laughs a lot more than the audience will which is not a good thing. Universal should ring up solid holiday biz from a glossy confection that will find its most responsive audience among women of a certain age on girls nights out. Set in that bicoastal world known best to showbiz folk of perfectly appointed California homes and first-class New York hotels where characters only concerns are their own neuroses and libidos ""Its Complicated"" spins on the not-unthinkable idea that a relationship that withered and died over years of distrust children and routine could suddenly revive again under illicit circumstances. The situation at the outset has upscale bakery owner-chef Jane Adler (Streep) seeing the last of her three kids off to college and with more contentment than apprehension facing life alone in her sprawling hacienda. But the graduation of her middle child occasions a family gathering in Gotham that includes former hubby Jake (Baldwin) a gregarious live wire who at nearly 60 has a young sex-bomb wife Agness (Lake Bell) and a 5-year-old stepson. An amusing early gambit has Jane and Jake encountering one another at a medical building where shes gone to see a plastic surgeon and hes visiting a fertility clinic. In New York however a few drinks together lead the twosome who have been divorced for 10 years to do the nasty. Baldwin is a hoot enthusing about his reconquest a cat-that-ate-the-canary grin on his face as he raves about how hot his ex-wife is while Jane is both flushed and aghast at what shes done even as she later kvells to her egging-on girlfriends about how naughty shes been. Cute and clever though the plot may be everything is played out in the broadest possible terms without an iota of nuance or subtlety. Characters rip snort and holler or at least make faces in reaction to the slightest provocation -- no one more so than Streep who guffaws slaps her hands together and otherwise gesticulates with amazed glee far far more than called for by events. Charming and wonderful though her character may be she carries pleasure with herself to an uncomfortable extreme a trait exacerbated by Jakes pages of dialogue extolling her outright amazingness. Worse her putative adversary Agness is made out to be nothing short of a wicked witch bad-mouthed incessantly by Jake and when briefly shown issuing harsh commands to her husband. The three Adler kids are indistinctly written which is nonetheless preferable to the buffoon of a prospective son-in-law John Krasinski is asked to play. Also less than satisfactorily defined is the other man in Janes life. Adam (Steve Martin) an architect engaged to design an addition to Janes house is a very straight modest fellow who finds Jane the first genuine prospect hes met since his own bruising divorce. The problem is hes dull and sincere a prototypical nice guy who doesnt seem as though he could fill Jakes shoes in the lust-and-fun department. Once she knew Martin was going to play the part its too bad that Meyers didnt rewrite it to make Adam a bit eccentric impudent secretly perverse -- anything to give Martin something to play other than a raucously funny scene in which Adam and Jane get stoned at a kids party. So it mostly falls to Baldwin who despite all the fawning dialogue has a blast as the paunchy graying hound-dog and enthusiastically shares his good times with the audience. More than once he strips down for action to shamelessly reveal his middle-age bulk (Streep shares these scenes but is more discreet) and the thesps comic timing is on the money. Mostly shot in New York despite the predominantly West Coast setting the pic comes in a deluxe package with the utmost attention paid to detailing the many material delights of carefree wealth while lenser John Toll following the golden rule of old Hollywood studio cinematography dedicates himself first and foremost to making the leading lady look effortlessly fabulous.
