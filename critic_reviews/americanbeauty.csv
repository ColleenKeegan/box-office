In other words its not your typical high-concept Hollywood film and some feel it might be a hard sell with mainstream audiences. But positive word-of-mouth is spreading through the industry after early screenings in Los Angeles and New York City. Rest assured this film will not be overlooked come Academy Awards time. Kevin Spacey gives an Oscar-caliber performance as Lester Burnham a man only going through the motions of living. At heart hes lost and searching for meaning in his well-appointed but empty life. Annette Bening may also be considered for Oscar gold for her portrayal as his brittle wife Carolyn. Shes a woman who just skims the surface of life preferring a thin facade to introspection. Their daughter Jane played with mature confidence by Thora Birch is emotionally removed from them and is just serving time until she can escape the confines of her homelife. Mena Suvari gives a smoldering performance as Angela Hayes Janes best friend. Angela is a Lolita-in-waiting and sets her sights on Lester a sitting duck for a domestic disaster. The strange boy next door enters the picture. Ricky Fitts played by Wes Bentley is a troubled soul who pines for Jane and is befriended by her increasingly unstable father Lester. Fitts has an annoying habit of videotaping everyone around him and his footage (his POV or point-of-view) is used as a counterpoint to the story and is artfully intercut as part of the film. Rickys father Col. Fitts is played by Chris Cooper. Hes a recently retired Marine with a twisted sense of how to raise and discipline his son. Rickys mother played by Allison Janney is just an emotional shell. Shes incapable of doing anything more than just sitting by and watching while her family falls apart. As Ricky observes at one point ""Never underestimate the power of denial."" In short order Lester leaves his boring job after blackmailing his boss and Carolyn has a brief affair with a fellow real-estate broker played by Peter Gallagher. All hell breaks lose in both families as carefully constructed illusions about their lives fall apart. Alan Ball and Sam Mendes Thought-provoking and scathingly funny ""American Beauty"" is the motion-picture debut of two brilliant new talents and the confirmation of the gifts of two others. American screenwriter Alan Ball and British director Sam Mendes -- both from the theater -- introduce their skills to cinema in this tightly wrought and multilayered film. And once again Bening and Spacey prove themselves to be two of the our strongest actors. The 34-year-old Mendes was nominated for a 1998 Tony for his direction of the Roundabout Theatres Broadway revival of ""Cabaret"" with Alan Cummings and Natasha Richardson. And he staged the past seasons limited run at Broadways Cort Theatre of David Hares ""The Blue Room"" with Nicole Kidman. Mendes has an amazing cinematic eye; his grasp of visual technique is powerful and original. Of course it doesnt hurt that he has the legendary Conrad L. Hall (""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" 1969) as his cinematographer. Ball who also serves as a co-producer on this film has roots not only in theater -- his work is known particularly in the Sarasota Florida and New York theater communities -- but also in television. Hes written on sitcoms including ""Cybill"" and ""Grace Under Fire"" and is a writer-executive behind the creation of the new Wednesday night ABC comedy ""Oh Grow Up."" (""Oh Grow Up"" premieres on Wednesday September 22.) Spaceying out Spaceys droll narration of the film is perfectly pitched. It opens with Lester introducing himself and his family. He wryly observes ""Im 42 years old. In less then a year Ill be dead. Of course I dont know that yet. In a way Im dead already."" This is a glibly delivered bit of information telling us the film is a flashback being narrated by a dead man. MORE MOVIE REVIEWS SITES Sunshine Boys and Girls Talk Talk Talk Talk Kiss Titan A.E.

Delicate and fragile then goading and resentful her Carolyn is obsessed by image and helpless in the face of reality. ""American Beauty"" is one of the best films released so far this year. It proves again that any great film starts with the written word. This DreamWorks production also makes it clear once again that a big budget isnt necessary for success. ""American Beauty"" cost less than 15 million to make. Spacey Benning and Hall cut their normal fees in order to get this project made. Youll be glad they did -- and so may they be come nomination time for this years Academy Awards. ""American Beauty"" opens in New York and Los Angeles Friday then nationwide on October 1. It is rated R for drug use language and sexual content. The film has a running time of 122 minutes.

Are You Sitting? Costners Great Too By Rex Reed  09/20/99 1200am Whatever He Is Spaceys Damn Good American Beauty may be the best movie of the year. Certainly I have not seen anything this good in 1999 and I seriously doubt I will see anything better. It is the best way I can think of to end an old millennium and begin a new one-the kind of powerful brilliant profoundly moving and refreshingly innovative film experience the entire motion picture industry can be proud of and the kind of rare and provocative once-in-a-filmgoing-lifetime experience audiences can treasure. After a punishing summer of bogus comedies dumb action epics and brainless sex romps that only the village idiot could applaud it is certainly a gratifying way to begin the new fall season. The kids have left the mall; time for the grown-ups to take over. American Beauty is at first glance another spin on the dysfunctional American family (is there any other kind?) that might remind you of The Ice Storm  but as each layer unfolds you realize how complex and unique it is. It throbs with the tempo of a vein pulsing in the head before a stroke. Here on a maple-lined street in a perfect all-American suburb no one is what he or she appears to be; everyone is pretending to be someone else each neighbor hides an inner self behind a mask of purpose and guile and there are dark secrets in the rose gardens. Kevin Spacey gives the performance of his life as Lester Burnham a 42-year-old disaster with a dull job writing pretentious advertising copy for a media magazine who is festering from a lack of affection. His wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) is a perfectly accessorized bitch paralyzed by fear frustration and sexual boredom who hides her misery in material possessions and prize American Beauty roses. Their daughter Jane (Thora Birch) is an angry confused teenager who hates her parents and feels ugly and isolated in her own home. On one side the neighbors are two gay lovers (Scott Bakula and Sam Robards) who are both named Jim; on the other side a Marine Corps colonel (Chris Cooper) with the most dangerous secret of all his zombie wife (Allison Janney) and their weird son Ricky (an astonishing performance by newcomer Wes Bentley) who behind the guise of a handsome all-American heartthrob deals drugs. Lester fantasizes about his daughters best friend (Mena Suvari) a seductive Lolita whose frank sexuality is really a cover-up for a deep emotional insecurity. Carolyn launches an extramarital affair with a flashy realtor (Peter Gallagher) and finds new power in target practice at a rifle range. Ricky films the whole neighborhood on his camcorder. Nobody has the courage to declare war on this constipated world of phony moral absolutes long enough to face the truth except Lester who starts working on his abs and smoking pot quits his job blackmails his boss for a hefty retirement package and stages a one-man rebellion that wrecks the manicured order and pretense of everyone around him. Meanwhile the sinister Marine colonel who collects Nazi dinnerware from the Third Reich in the same display case that houses his military assault weapons moves closer and closer to madness in a film already infected with a creeping empty lethargy of its own. Here is a cesspool-like microcosm of the American dream a rich and privileged suburb with a lot of disturbed people and one genuine psycho with the power to bring their ghastly world crashing down around their pointed little heads in one act of senseless violence as redemptive as it is electrifying. It is just one of the ironies in the shattering screenplay by first-time feature film writer Alan Ball that a film this disturbing can also be so funny. American Beauty is the most scalding appraisal of screwed-up American values I have seen in years yet I found myself laughing out loud at its sharp and biting sense of humor. The characters are so well dissected their foibles and peculiarities so accurately observed that they remain human even in their most absurd moments. The film is also a miraculous directorial debut for British Wunderkind Sam Mendes the celebrated whiz kid responsible for the London and Broadway revivals of Cabaret . His cunning eye for nuance is so self-assured its difficult to believe he hasnt been directing movies all of his life. Include the meticulous camerawork of the great Conrad Hall and you have the perfect recipe for a demanding and unusual film of surprises and revelations in every scene. The entire cast is uniformly inspired but it is Mr. Spacey who hypnotizes. Starting off as an oafish Dagwood Bumstead he gets laughs but builds confidently as his character grows and changes. After every attempt to be a caring father and loving husband is rebuffed Lester loses his blank deadpan doofus look and turns into a raving self-satisfied Lothario but even while hes making you laugh hes breaking your heart. In his transformation he finds nobility too late but its one of the most stunning portraits of a loser with dignity ever filmed. Dont be surprised if he doesnt cop a second Academy Award for this remarkable achievement. American Beauty is a film of such dramatic contrasts that its difficult to do justice to its importance in this enthusiastic but brief appraisal. Its a film of such rich complexity maturity revelation subtlety and paradox that you just have to experience it for yourself. Youll leave it dazed and thoughtful ready to re-examine your own life and you wont forget it easily. Movies just dont get any better than this. Are You Sitting? Costners Great Too More intelligence and integrity are on view (is this a trend?) in For Love of the Game . Yes its another Kevin Costner baseball picture but dont run in the opposite direction just yet. Its surprisingly sensitive extremely polished and not quite what youd expect. And the star is really (you better sit down for this next part) quite wonderful in it. Under the confident direction of Sam ( A Simple Plan ) Raimi Mr. Costner gives a restrained but emotionally accessible performance as Billy Chapel a celebrated pitcher with the Detroit Tigers who after a 20-year career in baseball is facing the greatest challenge of his life on and off the field. Hes tired hes facing retirement hes got a bad shoulder and constant pain from a near-fatal hand injury the game has changed the players and colleagues with whom he grew have died or moved on and now hes up against personal problems as well. Not only is he being traded to a new ball club but his girl Jane the love of his life for the past five years and the only woman hes ever treated as more than a baseball groupie is leaving him for a new job and a different life in London. Now in the final game of the season against the New York Yankees the game that will determine who wins the pennant Billy is forced to re-examine his priorities. While he stands out there in the middle of Yankee Stadium with 56000 screaming fans watching every nerve in his face he cracks his knuckles and watches the clouds move while the pieces of his life play across his mind like an old movie. For the first time in his years of major league baseball he realizes he has sacrificed everything for the game. Will he pitch the winning ball in the final inning? Does he learn the trappings of fame are empty without someone you love with whom to share them? Can he extend his career with a new manager and a new team in the twilight of his talent or will he throw in the towel for personal happiness? Its the stuff of a menopausal-male soap opera but so skillfully handled and sincerely played you cant help but like the guy. And Mr. Costner too. The action scenes on the diamond are exciting and well paced but its the personal side of an athletes life that holds the action here. Kelly Preston does a fine job as Jane the fashion writer with a troubled teenage daughter to raise alone who teaches Billy to love and trust while always being forced to play second to his obsession with the game. The film is most engaging when it chronicles their passionate but stormy relationship developing from casual encounter to intense codependence while his career rises and fumbles and her doubts grow. Ms. Preston has an unhackneyed naturalism for which the camera has an obvious fondness and her warmth and honesty have a melting effect on Mr. Costners trademark sullenness. The chemistry brings out an unfamiliar softness in his performance that is downright appealing. By the final reel he actually seems to be living his role with real conviction. Cynics will feel manipulated but I havent seen a good mushy baseball movie since The Stratton Story . Mr. Costner is no Jimmy Stewart but he cries almost as much as June Allyson. After Waterworld  The Postman and all the other gruesome pretentious bombs hes forced the rest of us to endure its nice for a change to watch him suffer.

You Want Fries With That? By John Hartl      Seattle Times Movie Reviewer Movie review XXXX ""American Beauty"" with Kevin Spacey Wes Bentley Annette Bening Thora Birch Mena Suvari Peter Gallagher Allison Janney. Directed by Sam Mendes from a script by Alan Ball. 115 minutes. Guild 45th Pacific Place. ""R"" - Restricted because of strong sexuality language violence and drug content. Praised to the heavens as the late-1990s answer to Mike Nichols ""The Graduate"" this remarkable new comedy-drama actually demonstrates more compassion for the older generation than Nichols did. Its as if Mrs. Robinson had acquired a soul and decided to narrate the story herself. While Mrs. Robinson was the most jaded character in ""The Graduate"" her counterpart in ""American Beauty"" is a middle-aged burnout Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) whose idea of rejuvenating his life is to have an affair with a teenage cheerleader Angela (Mena Suvari). Angela happens to be the close friend of his alienated daughter Jane (Thora Birch) who is so repulsed by her dads hormonal attraction to Angela that the affair doesnt get far. Still theres suddenly something different about Lester who quits his soul-destroying job blackmails his employer tells off his materialistic wife (Annette Bening) starts working out in his garage gets a job at a burger stand and hangs out with Ricky (Wes Bentley) the strange self-possessed teenager who has just moved in next door. Sam Mendes the veteran stage director (""Cabaret"" ""The Blue Room"") who is making his film debut with ""American Beauty"" handles it all with the undaunted assurance and sharp sense of style that Nichols brought to his first movies. Alan Balls script is a terrific piece of material and Mendes responds directly to its subversive provocative vision of a curdled American Dream. So do his actors especially Bentley who meticulously explores the full range of Rickys craftiness and spirituality and Spacey who lately has had one career-topping role after another - and now tops them all with this perfectly timed effortlessly droll performance. As his clueless real-estate-obsessed wife Bening is a hilarious caricature for most of the film jumping into a cartoonish affair with her chief business rival (Peter Gallagher). But she also reveals the characters true confusion in the final scenes. Suvari does a lovely job of revealing Angelas attraction to Lester while Birch suggests Janes equally gradual change of feeling from disgusted to jealous. Occasionally the script flirts with inverted cliches that are threatening to become cliche. The welcoming gay men (Scott Bakula Sam Robards) next door turn out to be the happiest couple in town. The most homophobic character in the movie reveals serious gender-identification problems of his own. A pot-smoking dope-dealing teenager who perceives a more coherent world beyond this suburban nightmare communicates the strongest sense of hope. But Ball spends just as much time demolishing stereotypes. Ricky at first seems a dangerous voyeur Angela appears to be a promiscuous sexpot and Rickys parents a retired Marine (Chris Cooper) and his quiet wife (Allison Janney) seem so shellshocked theyre incapable of feeling. Nothing is ever quite as it seems here. That extends to every shift in tone whether its suggested in Conrad Halls wide-screen cinematography Thomas Newmans score or Spaceys narration which tells us at the outset that Lester our hero for the next two hours is already dead.

With Kevin Spacey Annette Bening Thora Birch Mena Suvari. Directed by Sam Mendes. Running time 118 minutes. Rated R Brief nudity violence sexual suggestiveness (including a shower masturbation scene) teens talking dirty. At area theaters. 4 STARS Somethings rotten in suburbia and it doesnt take long to get to the source of the stink in ""American Beauty"" a tart funny and tremendously sobering movie about the deepest recesses of personal unhappiness. Kevin Spacey puts in his bid for an Oscar nomination as Lester Burnham a marginalized husband and father whos had it up to here. Lester informs us at the start in a narrative voiceover that by the end of the movie hell be dead. Its a device that worked in ""D.O.A."" and ""Sunset Boulevard"" a dead mans recap of what brought him down and screenwriter Alan Ball uses it to give the viewer a brief horrific tour of crossed wires inchoate longing dashed illusions couples grown apart parents at odds with their children and resentment that wells from poisoned hearts. Its also about voyeurism that favorite subject of moviemakers and how we fail to recognize just what were looking at. Lester and his Realtor wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) are strangers to each other and to their daughter Jane (Thora Birch). The closest the three of them get is when they sit together in silence at the dinner table. Theyre all feeling the pain. Jane is acutely embarrassed by her parents especially the way her dad gets all goofy around her model-wannabe friend Angela (Mena Suvari). Janes alienation causes her to secretly welcome the attentions of her new next-door neighbor a ferociously focused young man (Wes Bentley) with a camcorder and a well-positioned window. At least someone cares to watch her. Carolyn meanwhile tries to bolster her perfect facade with self-help tapes and other morale boosters even a neighborhood affair but when shes all alone with the disappointing person she has become she bursts into wrenching sobs. And Lester the fulcrum of this ""Ice Storm""-y movie tries to grab for the brass ring a little too late. He quits the rat race starts pumping iron and just when he begins to gain a little self-respect it all comes crashing down. If this sounds too depressing guess again. Theater director Sam Mendes makes his directorial debut with the same mix of humor and despair that marked his Broadway work on ""Cabaret"" and ""The Blue Room.""""American Beauty"" approaches a manic almost cartoonish edge without falling over. Both Spacey and Bening use extraordinary comic timing to bring these very sad lost characters to life. Spacey always an exciting actor elevates Lester from sad sack to Everyman two different animals dramatically speaking. The simple way he picks up a dish by first pointedly curling his fingers around the edge is enough to shut up Lesters bickering family; how many actors can do that with a plate of asparagus? Also astonishingly good is Birch a teenage actress who embodies the angst and hormonal Dow-Jones spikes of adolescence. The movie explores the vast gulf between what people want for themselves and what they bring upon themselves. ""Theres nothing worse in life than being ordinary"" says the provocative Angela with the confidence only possessed by those who havent lived yet.

Tired Satire - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Satire Tired SatireMOVIES - MOVIE REVIEW`American Beauty Has Won Praise Out Of All Proportion For An Unoriginal StorySeptember 24 1999|By Jay Boyar Sentinel Movie CriticAfew weeks ago - after an advance screening of American Beauty - I decided that the little satirical film would come and go without much fuss.But in the weeks since I saw the film it has opened in a few places to ridiculously generous reviews. Entertainment Weekly called it ``bracing in its intensity and the New York Times praised its ``eloquent flights of fancy.For more reviews along with schedules maps and directions to theaters check out the movies area of Calendar Online atcalendar.orlando sentinel.comIm sorry to say that even the usually reliable David Denby of The New Yorker seems to have popped his cork proclaiming it ``by far the strongest American film of the year. So now Im thinking that American Beauty might be remembered for something elseThe movie that caused a lot of movie critics to lose what was left of their minds.At the center of the story is Lester Burnham a hollow corporate Everyman played by Kevin Spacey. This 42-year-old media marketing magazine writer is married to a real estate agent named Carolyn. As played by Annette Bening Carolyn is the sort of killer salesperson who gives her profession a bad name.As the film opens Lester is nearing the end of his rope. And when Carolyn who wont sleep with Lester has an affair with another killer real estate agent this is just another aspect of the middle-class American hypocrisy and decay that the filmmakers have taken it upon themselves to expose and lampoon.At its simplest level American Beauty is the story of Lesters attempt to find meaning and excitement in his life.This isnt a bad premise for a satire. I only wish it had occurred to director Sam Mendes or screenwriter Alan Ball - both of whom are new to movies - that the targets they have chosen are easy and all-too-familiar. In fact to judge from the heavy-handedness of the satire here they seem to think that they are breaking new ground and therefore need to be extremely clear about what they are doing.Their attacks on real-estate agents corporate America and suburbia arent so much shooting fish in a barrel as they are shooting fish in a shallow dish.The filmmakers even trot out those old symbols of middle-class phoniness the white picket fence and the red rose. But after Blue Velvet and TVs Picket Fences youd think that Mendes and Ball would be too embarrassed to go there.In addition to being rather obvious the film is also so smug that Donald Trump even on his worst day would seem positively humble by comparison.Theres a distasteful swagger in the way the filmmakers make a hero of a drug dealer - a flaunting of their supposed hipness. And is there anything more politically correct in American movies today than this ones full embrace of the often-repeated canard that the most anti-gay people are secretly gay?Now theres a flight of fancy for you.Why then the extravagant praise for American Beauty?Well the filmmakers do have some talent. They do a decent job of balancing the many elements of what is essentially an ensemble piece.In addition to Carolyn and Lester there are also the couples surly adolescent daughter (Thora Birch) and her beautiful pointedly blond best friend (Mena Suvari) a cheerleader on whom Lester has a dangerous midlife crush.And lets not forget Carolyns lover (Peter Gallagher) the Burnhams scary military-minded neighbor (Chris Cooper) and his weirdo son (Wes Bentley) a young man who deals drugs and secretly videotapes the Burnhams daughter.Its also true that the movie is beautifully photographed. And I must admit that Spacey gives an exceptional performance As Lester hes both world-weary and energized and that combination isnt easy to bring off.But all of this still does not add up to ``by far the strongest American film of the year.Possibly some of the praise for the film (which opens locally today) is spill-over from the theater world. Spacey recently triumphed in a Broadway production of The Iceman Cometh and director Mendes recent stage work includes The Blue Room (with Nicole Kidman) and the recent revival of Cabaret. That would certainly help to account for the response of the New York reviewers who can often influence others.Then again perhaps a lot of critics identified intensely with Lester a journalist who is sick of his job and who secretly lusts after teenagers.I would like to think that Im wrong about that. And Id also like to think that if American Beauty is remembered at all it will be as the movie in which a potential future first lady performs vigorous if simulated sexual intercourse while shouting obscenities.That potential future first lady is Bening. She is of course the real-life wife of Warren Beatty - a man who may or may not be serious about running for the presidency.If he is and if he should somehow win then American Beauty in which Bening and Gallagher appear to make love could become a curious cultural artifact - the Bedtime for Bonzo of our wilder crazier times.Thats the way I prefer to look at it anyway.

"A Good Year for the Roses? Slate Sign In Sign Up A Good Year for the Roses? A Good Year for the Roses? Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Sept. 18 1999 330 AM A Good Year for the Roses? American Beauty is blooming but rank; For Love of the Game is overripe. By David Edelstein American Beauty Directed by Sam Mendes DreamWorks SKG For Love of the Game Directed by Sam Raimi Universal Pictures Early in American Beauty Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) a weary reporter for a media magazine masturbates in the shower while informing us in voice-over that were witnessing the highlight of his day. He peers through tired eyes out the window at his manicured suburban tract-house lawn where his wife Carolyn (Annette Bening)--whose gardening clogs he points out are color-coordinated with the handles of her shears--snips roses (American beauties) and twitters about Miracle-Gro to a gay yuppie (Scott Bakula) on the other side of a white picket fence. ""I have lost something"" says Lester. ""Im not exactly sure what it is but I know I didnt always feel this ... sedated."" Apparently Lester doesnt realize that snipped roses are garden-variety symbols of castration or hed know what he has lost. But the makers of American Beauty are about to give Lester his roses back. At a high-school basketball game Lester is transfixed by a blonde cheerleader named Angela (Mena Suvari) who is twirling alongside his daughter Jane (Thora Burch). Ambient noise falls away the crowd disappears and there she is Lesters angel writhing in slow motion--just for him. She opens her jacket (shes naked underneath) and red rose petals drift out. Later Lester envisions her on a bed of red petals then immersed in a bath of red petals. Back in the roses for the first time in years hes soon pumping iron smoking pot and telling off his frigid wife and faceless bosses convinced that whatever he has lost hes getting back baby. Advertisement The movie is convinced too--which is odd since the fantasy of an underage cheerleader making a middle-aged mans wilted roses bloom is a tad ... primitive. But American Beauty doesnt feel primitive. It feels lustrously hip and aware and a lot of critics are making big claims for it. The script by Alan Ball a playwright and former sitcom writer carries an invigorating blast of counterculture righteousness along with the kind of pithily vicious marital bickering that makes some viewers (especially male) say ""Yeah Tell that bitch off"" More important it has a vein of metaphysical yearning which the director Sam Mendes mines brilliantly. A hotshot English theater director (his Cabaret revival is still on the boards in New York) Mendes gives the film a patina of New Age lyricism and layer upon layer of visual irony. The movies surface is velvety and immaculate--until the action is abruptly viewed through the video camera of the teen-age voyeur next door (Wes Bentley) and the graininess of the video image (along with the plangent music) suggests how unstable the molecules that constitute our ""reality"" really are. Mendes can distend the real into the surreal with imperceptible puffs. Aided by his cinematographer Conrad Hall and editors Tariq Anwar and Chris Greenbury he creates an entrancing vision of the American nuclear family on the verge of a meltdown. AmericanBeauty is so wittily written and gorgeously directed that you might think youre seeing something archetypal--maybe even the Great American Movie. But when you stop and smell the roses ... Well that scent isnt Miracle-Gro. The hairpin turns from farce to melodrama from satire to bathos are fresh and deftly navigated but almost every one of the underlying attitudes is smug and easy from the corporate flunky named ""Brad"" to the interchangeable gay neighbors (theyre both called ""Jim"") to the brutally homophobic patriarch next door an ex-Marine colonel (Chris Cooper) who has reduced his wife (the normally exuberant Allison Janney) to a catatonic mummy and his son Ricky (Bentley) to a life of subterranean deception. (The colonels idea of bliss is watching an old Ronald Reagan military picture on television Hows that for subtle?) Lesters wife Carolyn is even more stridently caricatured. A real-estate broker who fails to sell a big house (her only potential customers are blank-faced African-Americans Indian-Americans and surly lesbians) she wears a mask of perky efficiency and insists on listening to Muzak while she and her husband and daughter eat her ""nutritious yet savory"" dinners. Its amazing that Mendes and Ball get away with recycling so many stale and reactionary ideas under the all-purpose rubric of ""black comedy."" But its also possible that those ideas have rarely been presented so seductively. Several months ago Daniel Menaker in Slate identified a strain in contemporary film in which the protagonist attempts to break through our cultural and technological anesthetization into ""the real."" Thats the theme here too and its extraordinarily potent at times even heartbreaking. The symbols however have been cunningly reversed. In movies like sex lies and videotape (1989) the protagonist has to put away the video camera to ""get real""; in American Beauty its Ricky Fitts the damaged stoner videomaker next door who sees beauty where nonartists see only horror or nothingness. In the films most self-consciously poetic set piece Ricky shows Lesters dour daughter Jane--in whom he recognizes a kindred spirit--a video of a plastic bag fluttering up down and around on invisible currents of wind. Ricky speaks of glimpsing in the bags trajectory an ""entire life behind things""--a ""benevolent force"" that holds the universe together. The teen-ager who likes to train his lenses on dead bodies of animals and people sells wildly expensive marijuana to Lester and somehow passes on this notion of ""beauty."" By the end Lester is mouthing the same sentiments and has acquired the same deadpan radiance. That must be some really good shit theyre smoking. I ts not the druggy philosophizing however that makes American Beauty an emotional workout. Its that the caricatures are grounded in sympathy instead of derision. Everyone on screen is in serious pain. The manipulative sexpot Angela who taunts her friend Jane with the idea of seducing her dad acts chiefly out of a terror of appearing ordinary. As the military martinet Cooper goes against the grain turning Col. Fitts into a sour bulldog whose capaciously baggy eyes are moist with sadness over his inability to reach out. (When he stands helplessly in the rain at the end the deluge completes him.) The character of Carolyn is so shrill as to constitute a libel on the female sex but there isnt a second when Bening sends the woman up. She doesnt transcend the part she fills it to the brim anatomizes it. You cant hate Carolyn because the woman is trying so hard--to appear confident composed in control. When she fails to sell that house she closes the shades and lets go with a naked wail--its the sound of a vacuum crying to be filled--then furiously slaps herself while sputtering ""Shut up--youre weak--shut up."" Then she breathes regains her go-get-em poise replaces her mask. Carolyn isnt a complicated dramatic construction but Bening gives her a primal force. An actress who packs more psychological detail into a single gesture than others get into whole scenes Bening was barreling down the road to greatness before she hit a speed bump called Warren. Its a joy to observe her--both here and in Neil Jordans In Dreams (1999)--back at full throttle. Advertisement American Beauty is Spaceys movie though. He gives it--how weird to write this about Spacey who made his name playing flamboyantly self-involved psychopaths--a heart. Early on he lets his face and posture go slack and his eyes blurry. He mugs like crazy telegraphing Lesters ""loserness."" But Spaceys genius is for mugging in character. He makes us believe that its Lester whos caricaturing himself and that bitter edge paves the way for the characters later more comfortably Spacey-like scenes of insult and mockery. He even makes us take Lesters final improbably rhapsodic moments straight. But do the filmmakers take them straight? If I read it correctly the movie is saying that American society is unjust and absurd and loveless--full of people so afraid of seeming ordinary that they lose their capacity to see. Its saying that our only hope is to cultivate a kind of stoned aesthetic detachment whereby even a man with his brains blown out becomes an object of beauty and a signpost to a Higher Power. But to scrutinize a freshly dead body and not ask how it got that way--or if theres anyone nearby with a gun who might want to add to the body count--strikes me as either moronic or insane or both. The kind of detachment the movie is peddling isnt artistic it isnt life--its nihilism at its most fatuous. In the end American Beauty is New Age Nihilism. K evin Costner is 11 years older than he was as Crash Davis the over-the-hill minor-league catcher in Bull Durham (1988) but he can still get away with playing a professional ballplayer. He moves and acts like a celebrity jock and he can make his narcissistic self-containment look as if hes keeping something in reserve--to protect his ""instrument"" as it were. In For Love of the Game hes a 40ish Detroit Tigers pitcher having his last hurrah The team has been sold and the new owners dont necessarily want him back. For about half an hour its a great sports movie. Costner stands on the mound shaking off the signals of his longtime catcher (John C. Reilly); he forces himself to tune out the huge Yankee Stadium crowd (the background blurs before our eyes and the sound drops out); and he mutters darkly at a succession of batters some old nemeses some old buddies. He also thinks about his Manhattan-based ex-girlfriend (Kelly Preston) who tearfully told him that morning that things were absolutely over and she was moving to London. Theres an appealing flashback to how they met (he stopped to fix her car while on the way to Yankee Stadium) then its back to the game for more nail-biting at bats. But pretty soon the relationship flashbacks start coming thick and fast and the balance of the movie shifts to whether Kevin can commit to Kelly and Kelly can commit to Kevin or whether his only commitment could ever be to the ball and the diamond and the game. Maybe its because Im a baseball nut that I hated to leave the mound. But maybe its also because the relationships scenes are soft-focus generic and woozily drawn-out whereas the stuff in the stadium is sharply edited and full of texture. The rhythms of the game feel right; the rhythms of the romance feel embarrassingly Harlequin and the picture drags on for over two hours. I cant believe that the director Sam Raimi (The Evil Dead 1983; last years A Simple Plan) thought that all those scenes of Costner and Preston staring into space while the piano plinks would end up in the final cut but Raimi apparently gave up control of the final cut for the sake of making his first real mainstream picture. He might as well have stuck his head over the plate and said ""Bean me."" SINGLE PAGE 1 2 NEXT Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Share Tweet Outside of Steven Spielbergs fantastical vision suburbia usually serves as a dumping ground for filmmakers who spurn either its neat flawlessly manicured lawns (Blue Velvet Edward Scissorhands) or its overdeveloped decaying grotesquerie (Happiness Gummo SubUrbia). Since Sam Mendes American Beauty takes satirical shots in both directions the blunt irony of its title is entirely expected but more surprising and revelatory are those fleeting moments when the film takes beauty seriously and finds it in unexpected places. In a nod to Sunset Boulevard Kevin Spacey narrates from the hereafter describing in hilarious deadpan the dreary suburban rituals that serve as a ""commercial for how normal we are."" Flashing back to a year before his murder Spacey laments his faceless job as an ad-copy writer his horrible marriage to brittle real-estate agent Annette Bening and his fantasies about goth daughter Thora Birchs underage friend (Mena Suvari). The early scenes in American Beauty crackle with tension as the manners and behavioral codes that govern this familys life begin to crumble from the pressure of their bottled-up frustration and denial. Each retreats to different avenues Spacey quits and tries to relive his glory days as a careless wasted teenager Bening pursues an affair with smug ""king of real estate"" Peter Gallagher and Birch takes an interest in next-door neighbor Wes Bentley a voyeuristic misfit obsessed with his video camera. American Beauty levels the usual broadsides at rotting social institutions--the marital spats between Spacey and Bening seem based on lost pages from Whos Afraid Of Virginia Woolf?--but its Bentleys disquieting video footage that lends the film its humane mesmerizingly sad tone. Mendes and screenwriter Alan Ball both making their feature debuts resort to a few heavy-handed tactics to get their points across but their sheer audacity is so exhilarating it hardly matters. American Beauty circles around its titular subject and reimagines it in funny touching and startlingly original ways.

As the latest mainstream movie symptom of our premillennial malaise American Beauty is so brilliantly acted written directed and visualized that for all its despondency and despair it is a lot of fun. Indeed as I watched Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening go through the ghastly motions of a terminally failed marriage with both wit and humor I couldnt help thinking that they would have been a big improvement over Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman in Stanley Kubricks needlessly lugubrious Eyes Wide Shut . Mr. Spaceys Lester Burnham long ago bought into the American Dream and now in the 42nd and last year of his life he belatedly wants out. He tells us all this at the outset in a voice-over of an aerial shot of the forest of maple trees shading the streets of his superficially orderly and comfortable community. Ms. Benings Carolyn Burnham is seen in all her materialistic vainglory through her husbands wearily jaundiced eyes but we never see him through her eyes. It is mostly his story that is designed to engage us from the beginning and his exquisitely ironic line readings keep us enthralled until the very end when he begins pouring on the falsely redemptive and nostalgic schmaltz. That is to say the scenes set in the idealized backstory past when sour and sullen Lester Carolyn and their teenage daughter Jane (Thora Birch) were supposed to have been one big happy and emotionally healthy family are far less convincing than those set in the decadent and disillusioned present. Fortunately unhappy families are generally more dramatically compelling and entertaining than happy families and the Burnham family is no exception to the rule but the dysfunction extends far beyond their front lawn. On one side of the Burnham house are two gay professional men self-introduced as Jim No. 1 (Scott Bakula) and Jim No. 2 (Sam Robards). They are always complimenting Carolyn on the roses in her garden and she is always saying nice things about their stylish attire. These pleasantries are viewed from a lightly satiric distance by an amusingly unamused Lester. Not that he is homophobic or anything. He can be shown masturbating during his morning shower and even at night in bed with Carolyn. But that is only because she has long since turned frigid on him ostensibly because of the stresses and strains of her high-pressure one-woman real estate agency but more likely because of Lesters status as a loser mired in a vaguely defined media-writing dead-end niche from which he is about to be dislodged by a loathsome efficiency expert called Brad (Barry Del Sherman). Still this heavy emphasis on sex in a heterosexual marriage to the point of a hypersexual appetite beyond Viagra reminds me of nothing so much as the libidinous one-track-mind monologues of excessively straight couples in the plays of Tennessee Williams and Edward Albee. Where American Beauty goes over the edge in this respect is in the newly arrived family on the other side of the troubled Burnham homestead. It consists of a sternly homophobic control-freak ex-Marine Colonel Fitts (Chris Cooper) his almost catatonically obedient wife Barbara (Allison Janney) and his once-institutionalized son Ricky (Wes Bentley) a high-tech camera stalker of sorts who deals drugs big-time and who is increasingly obsessed with Jane. Repelled at first by his intense scrutiny Jane becomes attracted to his air of authority. The final piece in the jumbled jigsaw puzzle is the self-important teenage siren Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari) who is destined to be the last object of Lesters lecherous daydreams. The cheerleading spectacle in which both Jane and Angela participate becomes a wet dream flooded with roses for Lester. He and Carolyn sitting in the stands are trying wholeheartedly to be dutiful parents. But when Jane brings Angela home for a girlish sleepover and Lester cannot take his eyes off the nymphet of his wildest fantasies it is not Carolyn but Jane who is offended. Carolyn is too busy being bedded by inspirational real estate tycoon Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher). All this lechery copulation and voyeur-ism never becomes as anguished and ultimately as fatal as the wildly melodramatic exposure of the colonels raging homophobia as a subterfuge for his lifelong closeted homosexual inclinations. It is one thing to play with the possibilities of sexual ambiguity in all of us it is quite another to violate the light distanced stylization of the milieu and its characters with a disruptive descent into the pathology of shame guilt and humiliation for a homophobe self-exposed as a hateful queer. What makes Mr. Spacey and Ms. Bening so marvelous as cynical misfits makes it improbable that they were ever anything else and that there was ever a time after their earliest childhood that they didnt know the score inning by inning. It is partly the actors partly the characters and partly the lucidity of the lines they read that makes them darkly funny and slyly identifiable with something in most if not all of us. Hence the fatuous rhetoric against the traps of materialism clangs as hollowly in American Beauty as the old Hollywood strictures about love being more important than money even an enormous amount of money in choosing a mate. Still it is very American to believe that we were ever as innocent and spiritual as we would like to think we were before all the current crassness came creeping in with all the upswings in the Dow. But dont try telling that to all the determined decline-and-fall people in the media. In any event Mr. Mendes has made a sparkling directorial debut with a series of strikingly provocative visual coups to both embellish and enhance the contributions of a splendid acting ensemble that reminds us once more of the wealth of acting talent waiting for just such a chance like this. The Seventh Degree of Kevin Bacon David Koepps Stir of Echoes  from his screenplay based on Richard Mathesons novel A Stir of Echoes  turns out to be as noisily obtrusive a ghost movie as the much subtler The Sixth Sense is an uncannily quiet one. Mr. Koepps chosen milieu is a tightly knit Chicago blue-collar neighborhood (as opposed to Mr. Mathesons California tract development in the novel). The idea was to make the background as realistic as possible to contrast with the ghostly foreground but from the word go Mr. Koepps movie makes the audience jump with jolting editing of the most mundane occurrences. And the ear-splitting soundtrack doesnt make us any calmer either. This is 90s overkill moviemaking with a vengeance. By the end of the movie a gruesome neighborhood murder has been literally unearthed and the thrills and chills have been extended into the present with two righteous homicides and one attempted suicide all in a blaze of blood-splattering gunfire. Mr. Koepp and his collaborators werent taking any chances with first-week audiences. Mr. Bacons Tom a career-frustrated telephone lineman doesnt help matters in the lead role by seeming already emotionally unstable even before he taunts his bitchy sister-in-law Lisa (Illeana Douglas) to hypnotize him at a small party so that he imagines himself in a large movie auditorium where he is the only spectator before a huge empty white screen inscribed with indistinct lettering. This is Mr. Koepps one visual piece of genius after which all hell breaks loose with Tom driven by a ghostly hallucination into increasingly frenzied behavior that makes him look like a raving lunatic to his wife Maggie (Kathryn Erbe) and the neighbors. Only Toms little boy Jake (Zachary David Cope) fully understands what is transpiring on the screen. Jake too sees ghosts but he is an advanced paranormal. (Doesnt every family have a little boy like that?) Eventually Tom and Jake are constantly whispering conspiratorially together while Maggie the concerned and left-out wife and mother fumes helplessly in the background. The situation could have been played for postfeminist laughs but the actors are all dead serious. Still Mr. Bacon Ms. Erbe Ms. Douglas Mr. Cope and the rest of the cast display their considerable if unmodulated talents to adequate advantage for the popcorn level of moviegoing. Cant We All Just Get Laid? Michael Correntes Outside Providence  from a screenplay by Mr. Corrente and Peter and Bobby Farrelly is a sweet little movie almost like the ones we are always complaining they dont make anymore. I didnt particularly believe the charming class-crossing boy-girl stuff-between Shawn Hatosys underachieving reform school material from Rhode Island trashville packed off to a prep school and Amy Smarts overachieving upscale Virginian with a warm heart under her classy facade. But hey if you dont buy the dream you should stay away from the movies altogether. Mr. Hatosy and Ms. Smart are real comers whether you accept the marvelous delicacy of their relationship or not. Alec Baldwin is a revelation also as the boys gruffly affectionate roughneck of a father and the deep love shown by the Hatosy character toward his crippled kid brother without any gooey sentimentality brought me almost to tears. With all these nice things I suppose I can almost put up with the box-office infusion of drugs and four-letter words.

Ever since Levittown our cinema has by all genre means possible hacked away at the allegedly arid moonscapes that ring our cities and pared down suburban life to silent breakfast-table wars between oppressed organization men their frustrated wives and a generation of resentful children itching to disown their privilege first through free love and activism then through Me Decade narcissism and finally -- so say the pundits -- through the naysaying lethargy of Generation X. But if you think youve seen it all in Edward Scissorhands Serial Mom The Ice Storm and Pleasantville get ready for American Beauty. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Made with swaggery panache by transatlantic theater whiz Sam Mendes who directed the acclaimed The Blue Room the movie opens as a malicious tease hinting at a murder mystery surrounding its unpromising narrator. Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is a lowly ad man whose sagging shoulders and overhanging gut bespeak loser not only in his own eyes but in those of his bosses his overcompensatingly chipper wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) and his insecure daughter Jane played with inspired sullenness by Thora Birch. By long habit every member of the Burnham family has been subjugating their rage and secret desires to the narrow band of dogged conformity that gets them -- just barely -- through the day. When Lester egged on by encounters with two youngsters exactly the age he was when he was at his happiest -- Janes blond cheerleader friend Angela (Mena Suvari) and Ricky Fitts (newcomer Wes Bentley) a neighbor given to tracking Jane with a camera -- starts shedding weight and responsibility by the pound in order to live free he blows the cover of everyone in his orbit. The repressed returns unhinged As the Burnhams run spectacularly amok the movies running joke is that the towns most normal inhabitants are a twinlike gay couple named Jim and Jim.Mendes has cannily turned his inexperience with film into an asset. Unfettered by allegiance to a single genre and pepped by Alan Balls smart script American Beauty darts between the bouncy pacing of venomous black comedy and the slow cadences of a moody character drama that reaches into dark places largely untouched by suburban satire even in Ang Lees The Ice Storm. Sidestepping the usual snobby caricatures of suburban decor Mendes and cinematographer Conrad Hall achieve a discreetly chill loneliness that rises like fog off the gleaming kitchens and polished tables with their vases set dead center. In one scene Rickys mother played with numb inertia by the wonderful Allison Janney gazes around her spotless dining room and apologizes to a visitor for the mess. It could like almost every other scene in the movie be the occasion for a cheap throwaway laugh but Mendes has all the actors playing their characters straight without so much as a wink at the camera. American Beauty has the feel of a movie thats been extensively rehearsed. After a string of poorly chosen roles Bening is back in top form drumming up sympathy and sniggers in uncomfortably equal measure for Lesters desperate chatterbox of a wife while Spacey plumbs beneath his bad-boy nonchalance to a man unraveling from one kind of loser into another until at last he earns a kind of equanimity.Less an attack on suburbanites than an indictment of the emotional death produced by isolation and commodity fetishism (Carolyn sells shoddy real estate) the ""beauty"" of the films title slithers around attaching itself now to the pneumatic Angela now to a mountain of rose petals now -- audaciously -- to the violent undertow that tugs at the neighborhoods studied serenity. Barring one unfortunate scene that implies its okay to sleep with an underage slut but not with an underage virgin American Beauty surprises you with a kind of hardheaded romanticism. In the end it is Ricky the movies eyes and ears who holds the key to its ambiguous aesthetic. This troubled boy who smiles faintly at the sight of a head covered in blood also rejoices over an empty plastic bag blowing in the wind. ""There is this entire life behind things"" he murmurs. And so there is even in that shrine to thing-worship the American suburb. Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke? NEXT Contact Ella Taylor Follow L.A.

Starring Kevin Spacey Annette Bening Thora Birch Mena Suvari Wes Bentley Chris Cooper and Allison Janney. Directed by Sam Mendes. Written by Alan Ball. (Rated R. 118 minutes.) ""American Beauty"" is a wonder of a film -- a luminous beautifully executed drama that gathers the best cast of 1999 and marks a sensational screen debut for Sam Mendes the British theater director of ""Cabaret"" and ""The Blue Room."" Mendes achievement is so remarkable that its tempting to call this the best stage-to-film crossover since Mike Nichols directed ""Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" in 1966. Hes that good an abundantly gifted man who works brilliantly and probingly with actors has a mastery of narrative complexity and understands the compositional and visual demands of film. ""American Beauty"" -- which took home five Academy Awards including best picture best actor for Kevin Spacey and best director for Mendes -- is a dazzling tale of loneliness desire and the hollowness of conformity. ""Beauty"" is about the gap between our ideals of love comfort and success and the hands we finally get dealt. Its often funny and desperately sad in the same breath but it acknowledges the absurdity and desolation of contemporary lives and ultimately forgives and loves its cast of seekers. Spacey plays Lester Burnham a suburban dad who hates his job and is stuck in a loveless marriage to a status-starved real-estate agent played by Annette Bening. Their sullen daughter Jane (Thora Birch) hates them and Lester knows they see him as ""this gigantic loser."" ""Theyre right"" he says in the ironic voice-over that opens the film. ""Ive lost something. I dont know what it is but I know I havent always felt this sedated. But its never too late to get it back."" His catalyst is Janes best friend Angela a precocious blond vixen played by the terrific Mena Suvari (""American Pie""). When Lester sees his Lolita in a high school cheerleading routine and overhears her describing him as hot the floodgates open He quits his job gets high buys a new car cranks up the rock n roll and starts telling the blunt unmediated truth. ""American Beauty"" is difficult in that it doesnt spell out its intentions or indicate as most films do the kind of emotions it expects from us. The script by Alan Ball (TVs ""Cybill"") works off a variety of tones and colors and also splits the focus among seven primary characters. ""American Beauty"" has the quality like ""The Graduate"" or ""Nashville"" or ""The Piano"" of a wholly original work that doesnt recycle past films but offers a new way of seeing. Its Mendes film in every sense but it also marks a career high for veteran cinematographer Conrad L. Hall whose images are unforgettable and for each of the actors. ""American Beauty"" is a great tremendously entertaining experience. I only wish there were more films this satisfying. ..

American Beauty By Peter Travers October 1 1999 More News Sundance 2015 Stars Answer Peter Travers Burning Question 10 Best Movies of 2014 All Stories >> The fall film season kicks off in high gear with American Beauty a comedy of shocking gravity that comes front-loaded with advance raves and Oscar talk. Now the question is Since buzz can lead to backlash -- check those Blair Witch spoilsports -- can Beauty stay unbruised? Lets hope so. Made for a 5 million pittance by the megabucks boys at DreamWorks -- Steven Spielberg Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen -- American Beauty is a triumph of acting writing and directing that defies glib description. Is the film farce tragedy thriller fantasy sitcom skin flick or moral fable? Yes to all of the above. More News Sundance 2015 Stars Answer Peter Travers Burning Question 10 Best Movies of 2014 All Stories >> Kevin Spacey in a knockout performance nails every comic and poignant nuance in the role of Lester Burnham a suburban Everyman whose life is coming apart. We first meet Lester when hes jerking off in the shower. ""Funny thing is"" he says in voiceover narration ""this is the high point of my day."" Lesters not kidding. His wife Carolyn acted with go-for-broke intensity by Annette Bening is an emotionally clenched real estate agent. Carolyns turn-ons -- her rose garden money and motivational tapes and the image of success she strives to maintain -- do not include her husband. ""See the way the handle on her pruning shears matches her gardening clogs?"" asks Lester. ""Thats not an accident."" So far so sitcom. Or so you might think since screenwriter Alan Ball making his feature debut has previously done TV time on Grace Under Fire and Cybill. (Balls new ABC series Oh Grow Up premieres on September 22nd.) But there are no network rules to constrict Ball this time. As a result hes done something extraordinary Hes turned the cliches of sitcom upside down. His marvel of a screenplay puts flesh on stereotypes and then -- testing for signs of humanity -- pricks them until they bleed. The clever brushstrokes of television writing yield to a depth of characterization that allows for fear feeling and that network bugaboo ambiguity. The suburbanites of American Beauty -- young and old -- have interior lives that encompass different ideas of beauty and truth. You dont peg these people at a glance; they keep springing surprises. Take Lester. Right off the bat he tells us hell be dead in less than a year. Whod kill this unremarkable man? In waking up from the slumber of suburbia Lester manages to piss off family friends and neighbors by speaking the truth. He tells his boss at the media publication where hes been whoring for the advertising industry for fourteen years that ""my job consists of basically masking my contempt for the assholes in charge."" He prefers working at a burger joint trying to recapture the remembered joy of his adolescence. In bed next to his sleeping wife Lester masturbates while fantasizing about Angela (Mena Suvari) a high school Lolita he dreams of bathing in a tub full of roses. When Carolyn wakes up appalled he says ""Guess what? The new me whacks off when he feels horny because youre obviously not going to help me out in that department."" Lester asks his two gay neighbors Jim (Scott Bakula) and Jim (Sam Robards) for workout tips (""I want to look good naked"") and buys pot from Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley) the kid pusher and former mental patient next door. Colonel Fitts (Chris Cooper) Rickys ramrod Marine dad is as oblivious to his sons drug activities as he is to his near-comatose wife (Allison Janney). He mistakenly thinks Lester is paying his boy for blow jobs. Instead Ricky is upstairs with his digicam filming Lesters teen daughter Jane (Thora Birch) as she strips crawls into bed and rages about a father who has never known best. Its the image of Jane on Rickys TV monitor that begins the film. ""I need a father whos a role model"" says Jane ""not some horny geek boy whos gonna spray his shorts whenever I bring a girlfriend home from school. What a lame-o. Somebody should really put him out of his misery."" ""Want me to kill him for you?"" asks Ricky. ""Yeah would you?"" says Jane laughing. Thats the setup encompassing whiplash changes of mood all of which British director Sam Mendes orchestrates with exquisite control and fluid grace. Mendes 33 makes a stunning debut in films after scoring theatrical sensations in London and New York with The Blue Room starring Nicole Kidman and the musical Cabaret now more vital than ever on Broadway with Susan Egan bringing dazzling new life to Sally Bowles. Mendes skill with actors is abundantly evident in American Beauty. Birch a former child actress (Patriot Games) glimmers with grown-up radiance while Suvari (American Pie) uncovers the self-loathing that Angela tries to hide. Newcomer Wes Bentley emerges as a major find able to hold his own with Spacey Bening and Cooper who gives the colonel untapped reserves of passion. You expect Mendes to shine at dialogue and performance. Whats astonishing is this theater mans visual sophistication. With the invaluable contribution of cinematographer Conrad Hall (A Civil Action) Mendes creates a world of boxes and traps that can be escaped only through fantasy or violence. Lester hurls a plate of asparagus against the wall to shock his family into recognizing his existence. Carolyn who finds no solace in an affair with a real estate king (Peter Gallagher) slaps her daughter and even herself to feel alive. Angela seeks validation that shes not ""ordinary"" by playing the cock tease. Out of deep loneliness the rigid colonel beats Ricky who turns to Jane for the comfort he cant find at home. And in this love story touchingly played by Birch and Bentley a healing tenderness breaks through the isolation. Ricky is transfixed by a particular image that he has caught on video. Its of a plastic bag being whipped around by the wind in an empty parking lot. ""It was one of those days when its a minute away from snowing and theres this electricity in the air"" Ricky tells Jane. ""You can almost hear it right?""Jane studies the image hard to see the beauty that Ricky sees. ""This bag was like dancing with me"" he says. ""And thats the day I knew there was this entire life behind things."" Its the life behind things that American Beauty catches as Mendes whips the audience around from humor to horror to something poetic and humane. The result is the kind of artful defiance that Hollywood is usually too timid to deliver a jolting comedy that makes you laugh till it hurts.

"American Beauty | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; american-beauty ) American Beauty (United States 1999) A movie review by James Berardinelli Over the years many films have taken a dark look at the supposedly perfect ideal of a white picket fence a little house and a nuclear family. For many the suburban life is the American dream. For others however it can turn into a twisted nightmare of unfulfilled desires repressed needs and shattered hopes. Because of the necessity to keep up appearances a serene facade often conceals a breeding ground for dysfunction anxiety and hypocrisy. Directors like David Lynch have made this their playground. Lynch in particular delights in depicting the root causes of social decay in suburbia - and he does it by autopsy. American Beauty is not as dark as a Lynch project since it allows for small moments of redemption but it mines the same general territory. If theres a rule in American cinema that all families not named Brady must be dysfunctional then American Beauty does nothing to violate it. Most teenagers think their parents are strange but in the case of Jane Burnham (Thora Birch whose largest previous big screen role was in Alaska) this is as much a state of reality as it is a state of mind. Her father Lester (Kevin Spacey) is suffering through a mid-life crisis. At the age of 42 he has become apathetic to everything. ""Both my wife and daughter think Im this gigantic loser"" he confesses at one point ""And theyre right. I have lost something. I didnt always feel this sedated."" Meanwhile Janes mother Carolyn (Annette Bening) places such value on status that she has turned into a ""bloodless money-grubbing freak"" who has no time for any form of intimacy. Her creed ""You cannot count on anyone except yourself."" She and Lester continue in their dead marriage for their daughters sake and so theyll look normal to the outside world. In a moment of clarity Lester admits ""Our marriage is just for show - a commercial for how normal we are when were anything but."" American Beauty is about the ways in which these characters grow and the catalysts that break them out of their near-catatonic existences. Its also about the emotional paralysis that comes with age and security. We take refuge in routine and after a number of years the thought of change becomes terrifying. Happiness the goal of youth is replaced by the desire for the artificial comfort that comes through the numbing sameness of repetition. Loveless marriages like Lester and Carolyns exist because neither partner possesses the willingness to break the cycle. And the children they think theyre protecting by staying together are often the biggest victims of their sham. Lesters awakening is prompted by two events. The first is the potential of unemployment. At first Lester faces this possibility with dread - without money how can he pay the mortgage and send his daughter to college? But then as he dissects the situation in his mind he sees how liberating it can be - freed from responsibilities he no longer needs to be a slave to the establishment. Then theres Janes best friend Angela (Mena Suvari) an attractive teenager who captures his attention and arouses his sexual interest. Lesters desire to have this girl (a need that borders on obsession) reawakens his long-dead libido. While Lester is going through a complete reconstruction of his personality and outlook on life Carolyns perspective is also changing. Frustrated by her relationship (or lack thereof) with her husband she begins an affair with a fellow real estate agent who calls himself ""The King"" (Peter Gallagher). While her sexual liaison with The King doesnt amount to much it lessens Carolyns tolerance for what she views as indolence on Lesters part. Then theres sullen Jane whos caught between the two of them. Displeased with her physical appearance she is saving up for breast augmentation surgery (something she clearly does not need). As the film progresses she develops an unusual relationship with Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley) the boy next door. He views life through a video camera and when he first trains his lens on Jane she is nonplused. After a while however she feels flattered and following a particularly brutal encounter with her parents she slowly undresses in front of a window while Ricky watches. Ricky has his own problems - his mother (Allison Janney) is virtually withdrawn from life and his father (Chris Cooper) is an ex-Marine neo-Nazi who submits his sons urine for drug testing every six months. Meanwhile Jane also has to deal with Angelas growing fascination with the possibility of sleeping with Lester - a consideration that disgusts her. American Beauty is the first feature film directed by Sam Mendes who has an extensive background in theater but displays a sureness that many veteran filmmakers are unable to match. At times evoking elements of Todd Solondz controversial Happiness and Ang Lees brilliant The Ice Storm American Beauty weds compelling drama with black comedy. The movie is character-driven but the three protagonists are so expertly developed that we are drawn to them for the entire two hour running time. Spacey Bening and Birch all give the kinds of top-notch performances that deserve (but do not always get) consideration at Oscar time. Spaceys Lester may be American Beautys narrator but through a low-key portrayal that conveys all the angst and confusion of a particularly bad teenage experience Birch makes Jane the films emotional focal point. If theres a weakness in American Beauty its in the way the story is structured. Spaceys voiceover narrative effectively kills a great deal of narrative tension when during an opening scene he reveals the films ending. This approach is often forgivable if theres a compelling dramatic reason for it but that isnt the case here. In fact the use of the voiceover allows American Beauty to close with more exposition than is necessary. We dont need to be told for example that one of the films points is that we should learn to savor every moment of life and to see all the hidden beauty the world has to offer. Mendes and cinematographer Conrad L. Hall add some wonderful camera work especially when it comes to close-ups. In most films we rarely notice this kind of shot because it is used indiscriminately. However in American Beauty it serves the definite purpose of offering insight into a characters mindset. There are many close-ups in this film and few (if any) are used for the banal purpose of varying shot selection. And Thomas Newmans dynamic playful score compliments the pictures effective visual composition. American Beauty doesnt trailblaze a path into hitherto untouched cinematic territory but its presentation of vivid characters in interesting situations makes the story seem fresh. In part because its not a complete downer and in part because it doesnt cheat the audience American Beauty is emotionally satisfying. Theres a sense of poignancy at the end but also the feeling that we have been on an incredible trip through the lives and souls of three perfectly-realized characters. In a year that boasts few truly memorable motion pictures Mendes can stake a claim alongside the likes of Kubrick and Egoyan as one whose cinematic vision both challenges and entertains.

Andrew OHehir Follow Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Alan Ball Movies Satire Entertainment News Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is dead at the beginning of ""American Beauty."" He tells us so apparently speaking in voice-over from some unspecific Great Beyond. He is most certainly dead at the end when his whole life literally flashes before his eyes (a grievous laughable filmmaking mistake). In between we see the last year of Lesters life as he struggles to awaken from the stupor of 20 years in the suburbs trapped in his loveless family and his meaningless job. To Carolyn (Annette Bening) his judgmental harpy of a wife and Jane (Thora Birch) his glum and uncommunicative teenage daughter Lester appears to be in the grip of an especially ridiculous midlife crisis. He quits his job buys a 1970s muscle car begins lifting weights and smoking pot and develops a Humbert Humbert-like obsession with one of Janes classmates. But for Lester this is a battle of mythic and heroic proportions. He is trying to save his soul trying to prepare himself to face death -- although he doesnt know its coming so soon -- with no regrets.Based on the impassioned post-screening discussion I enjoyed with three other viewers ""American Beauty"" will sharply divide its audience. Thats usually a good thing. A strident suburban satire plagued by an exaggerated tone and multiple layers of implausibility ""American Beauty"" accomplishes more in its incoherence than most Hollywood movies do in tidy soulless success. Its remarkable that any movie thats so ambitious and angry -- and that treats ordinary American life so seriously -- made it through the mainstream production channels in the first place. Plenty of ""independent"" films arent half this daring. For all its flaws ""American Beauty"" offers one of the best ensemble casts youll see in any American movie this year. Side by side with its false notes and awkward missteps it has moments of startling pathos and piercing painful hilarity.Director Sam Mendes best known for his recent Broadway productions of ""Cabaret"" and David Hares ""The Blue Room"" makes his film debut here. And though he is capable of subtlety -- the budding love affair between Jane and Ricky (Wes Bentley) the loner/voyeur who lives next door is handled with great tenderness -- Mendes basic idea here is to turn up the heat on Alan Balls script well past the boiling point. When Lester first sees Angela (Mena Suvari) Janes blond nymphet pal cheerleading at a basketball game he instantly goes all goggle-eyed and travels into an elaborate fantasy world in which Angelas body virtually explodes with rose petals. I suppose Mendes wants to make the point that Angela is more the trigger than the cause of Lesters transformation. But this aesthetic vision feels a long way from actual lust which is most often a nagging grinding insatiable sensation more like a chronic infection than a seizure.Liberated from his customary role as an inscrutable evildoer Spacey turns in a richly comic performance as a man visibly intoxicated by his every impulse. He gets high with Ricky outside a horrific dinner party where Carolyn is shamelessly schmoozing the self-styled ""King of Real Estate"" (Peter Gallagher). Lester blackmails his boss out of 60000 and drives home singing along with ""American Woman."" He lifts weights in the nude after hearing Angela teasingly tell Jane she thinks her dad is hot. (Spaceys legion of admirers will find plenty to enjoy here.) Even sprawled on the couch in jeans attacking Carolyn with a remote-controlled toy truck like a rambunctious toddler he seems infused with an inexplicable glee. He cant tell good ideas from bad ones and relishes the fact that he doesnt know what will happen next. You Might Also Like Carolyn is a much bigger problem although I dont know whether to blame Mendes the script or Bening whose formidable acting chops are expended on a feverish sexually repressed demon whose few tiny moments of possible redemption are undermined by burlesque. This is a woman who as Lester tells us in his opening voice-over has matching pruning shears and gardening clogs. In case we havent figured out that shes the embodiment of American materialism the script lays it out for us. When Carolyn snaps at Lester for nearly spilling his drink on the couch he responds ""This is just stuff. And its become more important to you than living. And honey thats nuts."" She literally beats herself up after failing to sell a house -- her ad describing a ""lagoon-like pool"" has gotten her in trouble -- and prostitutes herself to a rival realtor. Perhaps its not surprising that Carolyn hates both herself and Lester so much. But both parties in a dreadful marriage are always simultaneously the authors and victims of their situation and absent some understanding of that ""American Beauty"" turns Carolyn into a misogynist caricature for no good purpose.Similarly the films supporting characters although all well-played are a mixed bag. Birch is terrific as the moody and absent Jane who has long ago given up on both her parents (although its highly unlikely that this disaffected girl would be a cheerleader). If we can guess almost from the outset that Angelas junior-sexpot image masks tremendous insecurity Suvari (""American Pie"") plays the role with highly convincing hunger and depth. Bentley with his chiseled jaw and limpid almost feminine eyes brings a soulful intensity to the mysterious Ricky. But as much as I wanted to like and believe in Ricky an openhearted spiritual seeker who remains undamaged by the constant abuse he suffers from his Marine-officer father (Chris Cooper) the film asks him to carry far too much freight. Were expected to believe that hes dealing awesome pot and compiling an immense library of peeping-tom videos under his dads nose and to accept his stoner-mystic insights that there is ""an entire life behind things"" and that ""an incredibly benevolent force"" speaks to him. Amid the emphatic and often original stew of vitriol and humor in ""American Beauty"" it gets pretty hard to tell whether Mendes and Ball are actually trying to say something and if so what that might be. The fuzzy lyrical intrusions of New Age spirituality that bracket the story although strikingly at odds with the overall tone suggest that there is more meaning in the universe than in Lesters wasted tragicomic life. Like the films rather forced obsession with homosexuality -- centered on Coopers paranoid homophobic colonel -- these moments seem both revelatory and opaque as if momentarily exposing themes the rest of the movie takes great pains to bury. Perhaps future film scholars can decipher ""American Beauty"" as a Buddhist allegory of existence or a critique of heterosexual manhood. For now it remains a puzzling dream vivid in detail and overly obvious in symbolism fueled by half-digested lumps of malice and wonder. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

The must-see feature debut of acclaimed stage director Sam Mendes the film stars Kevin Spacey as an emotionally frozen side of suburban beef and Annette Bening as his frigid tightly coiled wife. The film is bathed in winter light and visual puns of the sort seen in those unnerving surrealist paintings by Rene Magritte.This is not a rose implies our narrator Lester Burnham (Spacey) as the camera glides across a stand of specimen American Beauty shrubs manicured and polished daily by Carolyn (Bening). From Lesters lofty vantage (he is dead and he sees things with startling lucidity) this is cultivation forced and force-fed external perfection lacking inner life. The suggestion powerfully captured with disturbing clarity by cinematographer Conrad Hall is that Carolyn has nipped Lesters manhood in the bud. And not only is Carolyn wrapped as tight as her precious roses so too is her daughter Jane (Thora Birch) who is even thornier where Lester is concerned.Little wonder that in his dreams when Lester fantasizes sex it is with Janes yielding nymphet chum Angela (Mena Suvari). He imagines ravishing the rose ejaculating petals across supple skin.The imagistic power of American Beauty is more eloquent than the sardonic screenplay by Alan Ball clogged with cliches about the sterility of the suburbs the superficiality of real estate brokers the repression of Marines and the emotional honesty of adolescents. The only cliche missing from the script is the one about the hooker with the heart of gold; in its stead we get the apparent slut who is at heart an innocent.Mendes nonetheless works this screenplay like a jazz virtuoso plays with a familiar theme such as ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"" - as a means to find an unfamiliar truth. The director of Broadways The Blue Room and Cabaret is fortunate - make that blessed - in his choice of artistic collaborators.Because the films visual conception and most of its performances have such disturbing power in dreamlike fragments American Beauty is able to burrow inside the cliche to understand how it came to be.There are two kinds of people in this naked suburb. Those with false values are like Carolyn concerned only with appearances. Then there are those struggling to find authenticity like Jane and Ricky (astonishing Wes Bentley) the teenage voyeur-next-door who are poking under surfaces to find the essences. Lester in hope of reawakening his dormant libido and life force is the figure who abandons the false values of material comforts and joins the authenticity seekers.Spaceys is the instrumental performance here. And the extent to which American Beauty succeeds largely depends on this resourceful actors ability to embody Lesters evolution from blob to man from the sucker imprisoned by appearances to the evolved being who learns to see.He does this by acting Lester from the neck up at first. Then as Lester becomes conscious of his own moral inertness and starts working out to become physically fit Spaceys entire body comes alive. While on the physical level the actor succeeds on the metaphysical level he does not. No one barbs dialogue as effortlessly as Spacey who can make the most benign simple sentence sound like the naughtiest double-entendre. There seems to be nothing Spacey is incapable of but expressing sincerity and sexuality is beyond him here. When he tries either it reads as insincerity or ambiguity. Thus Lesters conversion from the schlub to seer is incomplete.Benings more stylized performance likewise detracts from the films whole. On the filmmakers evolutionary scale unconscious people (such as Carolyn and Col. Fitts Rickys dad) are caricatures and the self-conscious characters (such as Jane and Ricky) are more naturalistic i.e. highly evolved. Benings Carolyn is a cartoon of defensiveness inevitably armed with pruning shears Windex or handgun to exert control over her environment. While her histrionic acting may work conceptually (Carolyn is an unrealistic person; therefore she acts in an unreal surreal style) this shrill performance is not of a piece with the films tone.But then there are the pitch-perfect characterizations by Birch (no longer the cute preteen from Monkey Trouble now an alienated adolescent who wears black lipstick and mood) and Bentley (who if my eyes dont deceive me never blinks until the films final sequence). As teens disconnected from their families but able to forge connection to each other via Rickys camcorder Birch and Bentley define a generation as James Dean defined his. Bentleys Wes takes the pictures and Birchs Jane is his relaxed model; these gritty videos stand in stark contrast to the prettified perfection of Lesters house and dreams. With their I-am-a-camera penetrating stares these two actors urgently express the movies point Those who care about appearances are doomed but those who learn how to see find meaning in life rather than in things.AMERICAN BEAUTY    Produced by Bruce Cohen and Dan Jinks directed by Sam Mendes written by Alan Ball photography by Conrad L.

"American Beauty (R) Related Item ""American Beauty"" showtimes Read a Post feature about the director American Beauty Gets Under Your Skin By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer Friday September 24 1999 Kevin Spacey is attracted to high school girl Mena Suvari in ""American Beauty."" (DreamWorks) Director Sam Mendes Cast Kevin Spacey; Annette Bening; Thora Birch; Scott Bakula; Mena Suvari Running Time 1 hour 58 minutes Contains sex scenes nudity masturbation obscenity and gunshot violence In ""American Beauty"" 42-year-old Lester Burnham informs us that in less than a year hell be dead. How could Lester (Kevin Spacey) the apparently successful husband of lovely Carolyn (Annette Bening) and the proud father of teenage daughter Jane (Thora Birch) get into such a fix? This overriding question gets its answer. But only after weve experienced one of the years finest pictures. By turns hilarious painful and brutally frank ""American Beauty"" gets America right where it lives in the cookie-cutter paradise of green lawns manicured roses and automatic garage doors known as suburbia. And no one brings this familiar place closer to home than Spacey with a performance that practically glows with vulnerability. Poor old Lester would be climbing the walls if he had the energy. Frustrated and defeated by everything he slouches through life with barely a flicker in his eyes. Its hardly surprising. His wife would rather fantasize about her manicured roses and real estate ambitions than get conjugal. His sullen daughter openly sneers at his ham-fisted attempts to communicate. And his job as an advertising representative is a soulless ritual. For comfort Lester resorts to sexual relief in the shower and on one ultimately comical occasion in bed next to his wife. As far as Lesters concerned hes already dead. That is until a cheerleaders sinuous legs lustrous hair and killer-blue eyes render him breathless. It isnt just that Angela (Mena Suvari) is human steam in a skirt. Or that she makes her seductive intentions toward him real clear. Or that she happens to be Janes best friend. Its that she just jump-started a stalled motor. Lester dusts off the barbells in the garage and starts a jogging program. Angela isnt Lesters only source of inspiration. After befriending 17-year-old Ricky (Wes Bentley) Janes strange classmate who sells killer weed and doesnt care about his part-time waiting job Lester gets positively radical. ""I think you just became my personal hero"" says Lester after witnessing Ricky casually quit when his boss threatens to fire him. Lester quits his job starts getting stoned the way he used to in the 1970s and puts the women in his family on notice Hes back. From now on hes doing whatever he likes when he likes. To hell with them and the mortgage. No one takes this lying down. While Lester gets fit smokes grass and experiences heady visions of Angela in rose petals Carolyn changes her direction. She has always been obsessed with wealthy real-estate king Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher) whose financial success she craves. Now its time to make a play for the competition - literally. Meanwhile Jane becomes involved with Ricky a dead ringer for the young Norman Bates who makes videos of anything - and anyone - that interests him and suffers physical abuse from his disapproving machismo father Col. Fitts (Chris Cooper). Alan Balls extraordinary script - beyond the creation of Lester - takes such worn stereotypes as the militaristic dad the sulky teen and the Martha-Stewart-nightmare wife and pumps them with life. Legendary cinematographer Conrad L. Hall lights this cul-de-sac world with vivid luscious tones - particularly when hes filming Lesters glorious petal-happy fantasies. And British director Sam Mendes who directed the London and Broadway productions of ""Cabaret"" begets an outstanding array of performances. Not that anyone needs coaxing The actors are uniformly good. Bening wires her role with such high-voltage archness and vitality wed swear we like her; and Cooper finds deft grace notes in that spit-and-polish character. But if ""American Beauty"" belongs to any actor it should be considered Spaceys exclusive property. His portrayal of the beleaguered suburban male of the species is so achingly tender our connection with him extends achingly beyond the grave.

But no one knew who Wes Bentley was when he walked in to meet with director Sam Mendes. Now no one is likely to forget him.Bentley had been handed the script by his newly acquired agent. ""I was just blown away. I knew I had to meet the director. I didnt want him to see me on tape. I had to show him that I understood the feeling of this script"" the 21-year-old actor says.

A casting director spotted him (with spiked blond hair and a goatee) in an audition line and he landed the lead in ""a real low-budget independent movie."" Its never seen the light of day. ""White River Kid"" in which Bentley plays a serial killer opposite Antonio Banderass con man is on the verge of a distribution deal. Bentleys newfound fame should speed that right along.

In search of comparison were sent back as far as director Mike Nichols first two films The Graduate and Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf? Like Woolf Alan Balls original screenplay misdirects you into thinking its black comedy -- that we could never find ourselves doing anything with these pathetic caricature characters but sneering at them. By the end of the film the filmmakers have not changed tone. The films heart is still in darkness. Whats been added is resonance harmonics of immense complexity. After we have ingested them we find ourselves hurting for these people. Yes they are intended as avatars for an up-to-the-minute and uniquely American social illness. But they are human beings too. ""Never underestimate the power of denial"" says one of the characters. The film is about what starts to happen when denial is overwhelmed. The protagonist is played by the extraordinary Kevin Spacey in his best work to date. As the camera floats over suburbia Lester Burnham introduces himself to us by voice-over much the way William Holden did in Sunset Boulevard ""Im 42 years old. In less than a year Ill be dead. Of course I dont know that yet. In a way Im dead already."" Lester introduces his wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) as we see her tending roses along the front fence. ""See the way the handle on those pruning shears matches her gardening clogs?"" Lester tells us. ""Thats not an accident."" Carolyn the Empress of Denial puts her faith entirely in appearances. She sells real estate. Lester has worked for 14 years at a trade magazine and a round of layoffs is approaching. They have a daughter Jane (Thora Birch) 15 or so who is appalled by life and especially appalled by both her parents. It is by her acting-out behavior that she acknowledges what her mother denies -- and of what her father to the extent he feels anything is vaguely ashamed ""Family"" is a micron-thick veneer over a necrotic void. This ghastly knowledge is perhaps the only commonality that father and daughter will share and it is exchanged in a code of sarcasm. ""So Janie"" Lester says ""how was school?"" ""It was spectacular Dad."" ""They think Im this gigantic loser"" says Lester of the rest of his family. Later when someone forgets his name Lester smiles and says ""Thats OK. I wouldnt remember me either."" He says he feels sedated. He will come to realize that what he needs to do to save his life is to destroy it. Opportunity comes in the curvy form of Angela (Mena Suvari) whose self-constructed promiscuous persona we will eventually discover is poignant denial as well. In one of Mendes smashingly successful theatrical/magical-realism devices Lester and Carolyn go to a basketball game where Jane with defiant joylessness is on the halftime dance team (look closely and youll see that shell do the entire routine without smiling). When Lesters eyes hit upon Angela Mendes has the rest of the world go away. Lester sits alone in the bleachers a single light upon him while alone down on the court Angela does the routine just for him more and more sexually until Lester perceives that rose petals emerge from her blouse. Angela and rose petals become a theme of Lesters imagination. When he overhears Angela tell Jane that she thinks her dad is ""hot"" Lester needs no more permissions. He centers his life on preparation for having sex with Angela. The mad danger of that its bald-faced foolishness may make him appear even more pathetic. Unlike Nabokovs Humbert Humbert ""Lester doesnt care."" By pumping iron nude in the garage by getting a new job flipping burgers by buying the 1970 Pontiac Firebird he denied himself when he was 20 he finally has gained control of defining his own pathos. Even if this napalm in the morning will consume Lester it will still feel like victory. ""Its a great thing"" says Lester ""when you realize you still have the ability to surprise yourself. It makes you wonder what else you can do."" A strong theme in the film is about loss and reacquisition and power. Carolyn will make her own compensation for Lesters new willfulness; it involves a rival real-estate broker (Peter Gallagher). And Jane will find companionship with the new boy next door Ricky (Wes Bentley). Ricky is profoundly strange as the result of the powerful coping strategies he has developed to survive his abusive ex-Marine colonel father (Chris Cooper). Ricky is also an enormously successful dope dealer. Lester becomes one of his customers. Ricky is the films benevolent force. ""I feel like theres so much beauty in the world that I cant take it."" He tries to capture it on videotape. Hes shot miles and miles of it. This is the first produced screenplay for Ball whose experience is in writing TV situation comedy (Cybill Grace Under Fire). His work is extraordinary mercilessly inquisitive widely observant emotionally diverse. Sometimes bile drips from the bottom of the screen. Sometimes it is ineffably sad such as the tiny scene in which Lester has to ask Angela about Jane -- is she happy? -- because all the lines between father and daughter have gone dead and there seems no possibility of repairing them. I cant remember the last time Ive seen a mainstream big-studio release this well-acted. Bening sometimes is a bit too big; but that is less the players fault than the conductors; Mendes should have modulated her a bit. Spacey offers exquisite line readings and the remarkable accomplishment of playing the plain text of black comedy and the more hidden text of melancholy without having to make scene-by-scene course adjustments. Of course a really good screenplay will not force an actor to do that. This screenplay is that good. You should be alerted that this is not casual entertainment. It is neck-deep in despair. Lester uses humor as the rope that keeps him from falling into the abyss. But it snaps. You will find at the same time he does whether there is a tree branch to stop the fall.

Robert Redfords ``Ordinary People (1980) did it. So did Ang Lees ``The Ice Storm (1997). Now director Sam Mendes ``American Beauty takes its place among the best family dramas of recent decades. Subtle and harrowing full of cockeyed humor and visceral pain ``American Beauty explores a modern family _ what makes it tick and how each tick can herald the existence of a time bomb moving inexorably toward detonation. Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) writer for a booster-oriented ad magazine is coping with early middle age. A comfortable suburban life has left him self-indulgent and a bit disoriented. ``I know Ive lost something he says ``but I dont know what it is. His wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) is insolent and self-pitying driven inside her frosty shell by years of rising anger at her husband and her lot. A real-estate agent who dresses and furnishes like a bon vivant she nonetheless is so emotionally eviscerated that when she cries she simultaneously upbraids herself for doing so. Their high-school-age daughter Jane (Thora Birch) is hovering near the junction of adulthood and troubled teen _ certain shes ugly thoroughly disgusted at her parents suburban artificiality. Add a cryptic boy who lives next door named Ricky (Wes Bentley) and his strange parents throw in a teen-age Lolita named Angela (Mena Suvari) and you have a potboiler that could go any direction. And it does. Lester encounters Angela Janes cheerleading buddy and falls immediately and obviously in lust with her much to his daughters disgust. Jane catches Ricky watching her and is both repelled and fascinated. Carolyn flirts with her competitor (Peter Gallagher at his oiliest). Rickys Marine Corps father grapples with the presence of a gay couple in the neighborhood. Illicit lusts blossom. If all this seems dizzying and disjointed thats sort of the point. What unifies it all is Lester who is either falling apart or finally waking up. His attraction for Angela and the confusion it produces sends him on a journey of self-destruction and discovery. He molts convulsively from a randy Walter Mitty into some sort of rampaging suburban John Belushi energized by the very things that should hurt him watching his life unravel even as it becomes enjoyable again. As matters hurtle toward their conclusions it is Lester who _ with both his vices and his formidable attempts at being honorable _ pushes them along. Spaceys Lester is a wonderful terrible junk pile of whimsy and rage self-doubt and resurgent hormones. And Bening who deserved a break after an unintelligible script scuttled her fine work in Januarys ``In Dreams gives a career performance here. Birch whose emotions bubble quietly and sear viciously plays Jane just right _ an adolescent struggling between wanting to love her parents and seeing their blemishes in stark relief as only an offspring can. Chris Cooper and Allison Janney are just as spellbinding as next-door neighbors Col. Frank and Barbara Fitts. He is a barking sinewy disciplinarian whod just as soon bloody his own son as face up to his failings; her years of obedience have left her one tiny notch away from catatonia. And both Bentley and Suvari give performances of astonishing depth that are beyond their years. As haunting piano and strings push this misfit block party to its agonizing climax you know whats ahead because Lesters narration told you at the beginning He is going to die. Things will implode. But in what manner? Ultimately Lesters end comes at his moment of redemption and it resonates with quiet irony. His liberation becomes his undoing but not before he has emerged as the kindest most stouthearted person in a confused lot of misdirected souls. What makes the film such a desolate snapshot of American life is the normalcy of its dysfunction Everybodys horrible and everybodys normal. ``American Beauty is American tragedy. In it we can recognize ourselves. And the mirror is not only cracked; its shattered and cannot be fixed. ``American Beauty a Dreamworks release is written by Alan Ball and produced by Bruce Cohen and Dan Jinks.

An acerbic darkly comic critique of how social conventions can lead people into false sterile and emotionally stunted lives ""American Beauty"" is a real American original. Multilayered bracingly resourceful and tweaked to push its many brash ideas to the edge and beyond this independent-minded feature represents a stunning card of introduction for two cinematic freshmen screenwriter Alan Ball and director Sam Mendes. Unusually off-center for a major studio venture this DreamWorks release will spark a raft of critical hosannas and play exceedingly well to sophisticated audiences attuned to the films caustic wit and mischievous sensibility. But breaking through to the mainstream public will prove a formidable and likely hopelessly uphill task indeed. The landscape of Balls story is the familiar one of small-town America and the initial take on the subject is the equally familiar one of houses with white picket fences and perfectly manicured gardens providing deceptive facades for lives wracked by hostility tension noncommunication and perversity. Fortunately this view is intended not as a revelation but as a given a starting point for a subtle and acutely judged tale in which nearly every important character metamorphoses in an utterly unpredictable way. Calmly observant narration by Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) informs at the outset that in less than a year from the start of the story hell be dead. ""Of course I dont know that yet"" he quips as he and his family are trotted out. Lester is a self-described loser having lost interest in his job at an advertising magazine as well as in any meaningful relationship with his beautiful high-strung real estate agent wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) and sullen high school-age daughter Jane (Thora Birch). Family life is a sham for all of them and they deal with it in different ways Lester admits it Carolyn refuses to face it and Jane is just waiting it out until she can fly the coop. Threatened with dismissal from his job hangdog Lester finds things begin changing for him when he becomes smitten by Janes best friend Angela (Mena Suvari) a blond Lolita with sex on the brain. Exhilarated by the ludicrous prospect of seducing her Lester begins obsessively pumping iron and fuels his youthful state of mind by smoking dope with a strange young man Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley) who has just moved into the house next door with his father (Chris Cooper) a recently retired Marine Corps colonel and shut-down mother (Allison Janney). Ricky frequently takes surreptitious video footage of Jane and when she calls him on it an unlikely but oddly convincing romantic friendship begins blossoming that finally gives Jane a release for her emotional frustration. Carolyn for her part seeks an outlet in the most conventional manner lurching into a motel-room affair with the debonair ""king"" of local real estate Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher). Evidently the only well-adjusted and relatively happy people in the neighborhood are ""Jim and Jim"" (Scott Bakula and Sam Robards) a gay couple with whom Lester takes up jogging. One of the films constant sources of delight and surprise is the way characters both hide and reveal their private interests and how they are often perceived and misjudged by others. It is not giving away too much or going too far into the storys many mysteries to say that Lester can approach serenity and even a state of grace despite his initial wormlike status; that Ricky confidently pursues a secret life in spite of close surveillance from his martinet father who forces his son to submit to regular urine tests for drug use; that Carolyns materialist preoccupation has in fact become her substance and that Janes amorphous personality is susceptible to being shaped in just about any direction by the first strong personality she meets. Consistently provocative and devilishly amusing through the first hour pic clicks into high gear midway when Lester and Carolyn finally have it out. They dont declare war exactly but Lester decides to let down any pretense to responsibility or normalcy in order to do his own thing as he did when he was 20 carefree and full of expectation. Blackmailing his boss for a big severance package he hilariously takes a gig at the job at which he was always happiest flipping burgers at a fast-food restaurant buys his dream car and openly smokes weed whenever he wants. His new freewheeling approach to life makes him giddy so much so that he believes he and his wife can revive their long-buried sexual relationship. But Carolyn and Jane are appalled at his breezy tell-it-like-it-is attitude fomenting a mood of anxious melodrama leading to the event promised by the opening narration. Ball a playwright and TV writer (""Grace Under Fire"" ""Cybill"") has composed a script as fresh and distinctive as any produced in the States in recent memory. The film constantly analyzes the characters actions and holds them in bold relief just as it moves the story along at a brisk clip a considerable achievement in itself. Beyond that the dialogue is tart and the characters are well and deeply drawn endowed with an inner life that allows the viewer to understand their often rash and unpredictable behavior. Main exception to this is Carolyn who so vehemently holds to her limited beliefs and system of denial (""I refuse to be a victim"" she rants at her lowest ebb) that she cant really develop or change. Scripts other significant flaw is making the climactic drama hinge upon the sexuality of one character whose repression smacks of hoary Freudianism. This development provokes momentary disappointment but doesnt detract too much from the full-bodied feel the picture leaves one with at fade-out. Mendes the hottest young British theater director of recent years on the basis of ""Cabaret"" and ""The Blue Room"" displays a very sure hand in his first film. As precise and controlled in its effects as his legit work ""American Beauty"" is stylized in its images and humor and Mendes has been exceedingly fortunate in working with a cinematographer as skillful as vet Conrad L. Hall who is unsurpassed in his ability to augment the meaning of the material he films by finding its perfect visual correlative. The ensemble of actors here could not be better. Uncharacteristically frumpy in the opening reels Spacey hums along with droll line readings before jumpstarting to antic but hardly overdone life upon receiving his wake-up call. His handling of innuendo subtle sarcasm and blunt talk is scintillating but he trumps these aces with the genuine feeling with which he endows Lesters efforts to win back Carolyn and the equanimity with which he considers his fate. Bening perfectly cast as the perfect wife goes well beyond the expected in such a role and is almost scary at times in the way she defends herself. As a closed-up girl Birch gradually blossoms in ways that are impressive but not always pretty Suvari socks over her role as a frank-talking nymphet while Bentley is sensational as the creepy kid living a complex life. Cooper is chillingly convincing as the tyrannical father Janney stands out as his ghostly wife and Gallagher cuts the right figure as a smooth-talking cock of the walk. Naomi Shohans production design and Julie Weiss costumes enhance the films look of designed reality while Thomas Newmans score and the many adroitly chosen song snippets often create ironic counterpoint to the exceptionally tart and entertaining proceedings.

By Jonathan Rosenbaum American Beauty is a brilliant satirical diagnosis of whats most screwed up about life in this country especially when it comes to sexual frustration and kiddie porn. Or American Beauty is a hypocritical piece of kiddie porn brilliantly exploiting an audiences sexual frustration and turning it into coin. Take your pick. Paradoxical as it sounds both of these statements may be true. American Beauty is after all a Hollywood movie like The Graduate (1967) and Risky Business (1983) two somewhat comparable historical markers that gleefully conflate social criticism and fantasy wish fulfillment so you cant tell them apart. Whether American Beauty will become a hit like those earlier movies is hard to predict but if it doesnt it wont be for lack of trying. Like The Graduate it sympathizes with rebellion and satirizes complacency but that doesnt stop it from taking digs at sexually deprived middle-aged women as if they were somehow the root of all evil. And as in Risky Business its exposure of cynicism and corruption periodically becomes a celebration of the same things. It isnt surprising that this DreamWorks movie is the love child of Steven Spielberg who bought the script and hired the director for it revels in the same sort of exalted and exhilarating doublethink that has made much of his fortune. Though it lacks the cynicism and crassness of last years Happiness it shows a related talent for working both sides of the street. However unlike Mumford--another ambitious comedy-drama opening this week thats pitched as a sort of State of the Union address--American Beauty cant be accused of wrapping an audience in the comforting cocoon of nostalgia. Yearning for an older version of America and American movies constitutes both the appeal and the limitation of Mumford writer-director Lawrence Kasdans parable about a mysterious young man (Loren Dean) with the same name as the small town he moves into posing as a trained psychologist. Its a movie so pleased with its brand of folk wisdom that it can easily con you into overlooking the sketchiness of its characters. The characters in American Beauty are similarly designed to illustrate lessons but its part of the strength of Alan Balls screenplay that most of the lessons seem to be worth learning. This isnt to claim that everything in American Beauty is new but it does have a welcome freshness. Its writer-coproducer and its director are both newcomers to movies. Ball has a background in theater and TV and is perhaps best known as a writer for the TV series Cybill; Sam Mendes is the much-celebrated stage director of The Blue Room (a reworking of Arthur Schnitzlers most famous play starring Nicole Kidman) and the recent revival of Cabaret. I havent seen either of those productions but Im told that part of whats impressive about them is their inventive handling of space. The same could be said for American Beauty. Like Mike Nichols in The Graduate Mendes seems elated to be adapting and expanding his stage-bound mise en scene (aided by the exquisite lighting of cinematographer Conrad Hall) an elation that can be seen in his camera moves and his choices of pop tunes. (Hes even more daring than Nichols when he makes an unmotivated lighting change--the sort of thing thats common onstage--to underscore the movies first indication that its teenage heroine has a crush on its teenage hero.) And like Paul Brickman in Risky Business he knows how to use the euphorically percussive and propulsive repetitions of New Age music--what sounds like wind chimes accompanied by a pile driver--to chart the stages of his heros success. Of course the casting of a known quantity like Kevin Spacey cant match the debut of either Dustin Hoffman in Nicholss movie or Tom Cruise in Brickmans. As an offscreen narrator who indicates at the outset that his character--like William Holdens at the beginning of Sunset Boulevard--is speaking from beyond the grave Spacey doesnt even belong in the same ballpark. Moreover the character he plays Lester Burnham is a squashed suburbanite with a wife he no longer sleeps with (Annette Bening) an alienated teenage daughter he rarely thinks about (Thora Birch in the Christina Ricci part) and a long-time job as an editor and writer hes about to lose; he isnt an affluent young man starting out in the world but a somewhat grizzled loser needing to be reborn. His rebirth begins only after he overhears Angela (Mena Suvari) a friend and classmate of his daughter say that she wouldnt mind having sex with him if he worked out and developed some muscles. Spurred by her comment and by various erotic fantasies about her Lester launches an exercise program the results of which become legible in Spaceys developing physique over the course of the film--rather like Raging Bull in reverse. Lesters newly won confidence sparks other changes in his life including a kind of spiritual awakening that carries him through the remainder of the movie. If youre wondering how an adults desire to screw a teenager can prompt a spiritual awakening an audience can accept without gagging youve hit on Mendess most daunting challenge as a director. He passes with flying colors though Lester isnt just a character with whom the audience is invited to sympathize but the object of a certain amount of satire--the point at which the parallels between this movie The Graduate and Risky Business become most apparent. The parallels break down and cease to become instructive when the daughter Jane and her next-door neighbor and eventual boyfriend Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley) begin to overtake Lester as the heroes and moral exemplars of American Beauty; the narrative may belong to Lester but its interpretation belongs in part to this secretive romantic couple. And just as the movie subtly and ambiguously divvies up its moral position between Lester and this couple it also straddles the realms of porn and satire. One reason the movie needs to negotiate these contradictions is that while all the major characters are crippled by repression some are viewed as more worthy of redemption than others. Some are mainly victims and some are mainly monsters. (Two minor characters seem to be exempt from this repression a gay couple who function mainly as foils and props in the plot.) The most obvious sufferers are the Fittses the father (Chris Cooper) is a homophobic and physically abusive retired marine colonel who periodically tests his son Ricky for drugs the mother (Allison Janney) is a depressive in perpetual retreat and Ricky who pretends to cater to his fathers whims is a successful pot dealer and a compulsive voyeur with a video camera and a morbid fascination with death. All these characters have a grotesque side with the colonel receiving top honors. But Lesters wife Carolyn--an aggressive real estate agent with a phony manner and an obsession with objects and cleanliness--is every bit as extreme a caricature. After she starts an affair with another real estate agent (Peter Gallagher) who gets her interested in firing guns to express her rage her monstrous parallels with the colonel who has a gun collection of his own become fully apparent. (Lester and Ricky have parallels as good guys one reason the script brings them together as friends and has them virtually duplicate each others mystical speech about beauty in the world.) Both characters are so didactically conceived that even vigorous performances by Bening and Cooper fail to make them fully human. Moreover they exist almost exclusively as foils to the other characters defined mainly by their function as villains. It might be more accurate to say that they along with Angela start off as villains and wind up evoking pity yet they remain one-note characters lacking the flexibility and depth of Lester Jane and Ricky. Saying that all the characters in American Beauty are victims wouldnt be entirely wrong. The movie is certainly adept at showing how awful life in the United States is at the moment--and thats what gives it some bite. But its no less adept at taking that awfulness and making it pleasurable to watch--and thats what makes it entertaining. Whether two such projects can be compatible is a question worth raising--and thats what makes the movie puzzling and two-faced. Clearly some deft ideological evasiveness is involved. David Denbys review in the New Yorker surmises ""You may...realize with relief that theres nothing of 60s cant in Rickys vision. What he says is free of psychedelic nonsense or political ideology."" Or you may realize with regret that theres plenty of 70s cant in this same vision and that this cant constitutes the films political ideology; this self-centered and self-satisfied New Age spirituality is no better than ""psychedelic nonsense"" though it fits much more snugly (and smugly) within an upscale 90s notion of what isnt nonsense. By the same token the movie is so boastful about its ""daring"" frankness regarding Lesters masturbation that you might not notice that it has broached more serious and equally taboo matters such as the relation of the characters sexual frustrations to capitalism and gun worship. (The movie makes the most of the parallels between Carolyns and the colonels attachment to guns in the crosscutting of the final sequence.) Its a tribute to Mendess skill as director that he can extract the maximal value from a script as ambitious and conflicted as this one--in part by giving body to its ambivalence rather than simply trying to sidestep it in part by giving the impression that he can solicit from his actors everything about these characters that theyre able to give. And hes particularly adept at creating rhyme effects between characters such as showing how Lester and Carolyn each pursue self-empowerment by singing along with a favorite musical cut while driving alone. Some parts of the script--Lester going to work at a fast-food restaurant the whole conception of Carolyn and the colonel the burst of affirmative lyricism that accompanies the tragic finale--are too neat to be entirely believable. But if these are flaws--and Im not sure that they are--theyre flaws I can live with.

"The Roses Thorns - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMovie Review The Roses ThornsFamilies get scratched as they reach for that perfect bloom in provocative American Beauty.September 15 1999|KENNETH TURAN | TIMES FILM CRITIC Unsettling unnerving undefinable ""American Beauty"" avoids quick and easy categorization. A quirky and disturbing take on modern American life energized by bravura performances from Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening ""Beauty"" is a blood-chilling dark comedy with unexpected moments of both fury and warmth a strange brooding and very accomplished film that sets us back on our heels from its opening frames.""This is my neighborhood this is my street this is my life"" Lester Burnham (Spacey) says in neutral voice-over as the camera narrows in from an aerial perspective to his red suburban front door as he delivers shock No. 1 ""Im 42 years old. In less than a year Ill be dead. Of course I dont know that yet. In a way Im dead already.""To inform us that as in ""Sunset Boulevard"" were watching a film narrated by a corpse is a quick way to get everyones attention but ""Beauty"" the provocative debut for director Sam Mendes goes further. Layered with surprises at home in unfamiliar territory this film more than doesnt let on what its thinking or where its going; it intentionally misleads with dramatic dodges and feints calculated to throw everyone off balance and keep them there.Whenever a film is this distinctive it invariably starts with the writing. ""Beauty"" is the first feature by veteran TV writer Alan Ball (""Cybill"" and the upcoming ""Oh Grow Up"") and in its ability to make us uncomfortable by changing emotional colors as subtly and gradually as a kaleidoscope it bears the hallmarks of someone pouring everything he felt constrained from doing in one medium into an extremely personal piece of work in another.""American Beautys"" subject is the hollow space behind the American dream the frustrations that hide under the perfectly mannered surfaces of our lives. ""Never underestimate the power of denial"" one character says but in some ways what were shown is not the power but the price of denial how a world without moorings without honesty without human connections turns everyone into a lost soul on the verge of a self-centered psychotic breakdown.Lester certainly fits that description when he takes us on a voice-over tour of his life. The first stop (and he coolly informs us the high point of his day) is Lester masturbating in his morning shower before putting in his time at a trade magazine called Media Monthly. His wife and daughter Lester says consider him ""this gigantic loser"" and not really disagreeing he tells people whove forgotten theyve met him ""I wouldnt remember me either.""Lester is equally savage about the other family members. Stepford Wife Carolyn (Bening) is a residential broker locked into a perennially losing battle with Buddy Kane the self-proclaimed King of Real Estate (Peter Gallagher). She prefers elevator music during dinner and spends her spare time worrying about her furniture and growing roses. ""See the way the handle on those pruning shears matches her gardening clogs?"" Lester asks witheringly. ""Thats not an accident.""Then theres 16-year-old daughter Jane (Thora Birch). Unsmiling insecure and ferociously unhappy her sullen anger is as constant and unwavering as an eternal flame. ""I wish I could tell her thats all going to pass"" is Lesters cold-blooded assessment ""but I dont want to lie to her.""These kinds of acerbic comments while striking in their drop-dead glibness are deceptive because they make ""Beauty"" seem more familiar than it is. Weve all seen this kind of highly stylized verbal farce complete with sarcastic line readings but director Mendes has something more complex and more subversive in mind.Though hes only 34 the English director has already established himself in the theater directing the Nicole Kidman-starring ""The Blue Room"" and a celebrated revival of ""Cabaret."" His accomplishment here is to capture and enhance the unlooked-for duality that is at the core of Balls discomforting screenplay. For in addition to being stylized ""Beautys"" characters have an unmistakable sincerity about them; they manage to appear simultaneously as caricatured sendups and painfully real individuals. As their emotional valence fluctuates so does our understanding of what is going on with them. Several different events unsettle the bitter and resentful lassitude into which the Burnham family has sunk happenings that threaten to collapse the emotional walls the members have painstakingly created around themselves.Goaded by his wife to take an interest in their daughters life Lester accompanies Carolyn to a Rockwell High basketball game where Jane is a member of a cheerleading squad called the Dancing Spartanettes. Desultorily watching their routine Lester suddenly has a vision and not unlike Paul on the road to Damascus is instantly transformed. He sees Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari) and nothing is the same.1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESA Road Paved in GrayJanuary 20 2002Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword",http://articles.latimes.com/1999/sep/15/entertainment/ca-10492,200,americanbeauty26,americanbeauty,latimes
"USATODAY.com - Biting black Beauty brims with brilliance Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 03/05/2001 - Updated 0213 PM ET Biting black Beauty brims with brilliance By Mike Clark USA TODAY American Beauty (out of four) Stars Kevin Spacey Annette Bening Thora Birch Wes Bentley Chris Cooper Mena Suvari Director Sam Mendes Distributor DreamWorks Rating R for strong sexuality language violence drug content Perhaps not enough credits have amassed to justify selecting the definitive Kevin Spacey movie role but lets take a brazen leap and do it anyway. American Beauty is a singular accomplishment so specifically keyed to Spaceys talents that it mandates going out on a limb to say it contains the performance that will ultimately be regarded as ""the one."" Besides all involved in American Beauty have gone out on their own limbs to straddle that dangerous line between trenchant black comedy (see deposed magazine writer Spacey hawk ""Mr. Smiley"" burgers in the drive-through) and a level of compassion to approach anything in the Oscar-winning Ordinary People. Read more Related Complete Oscar coverage Video American Beauty trailer More recently The Ice Storm and Happiness worked this same suburban territory with success yet the screen debut of stage director Sam Mendes (The Blue Room and the Cabaret revival) is so assuredly conceived as cinema that one has to give it the edge by a surprisingly wide margin. Like William Holden in Sunset Boulevard narrator Spacey informs us in the opening moments that hes dead so the suspense emanates from seeing which contender will do him in. Nearly every Beauty principal has homicidal potential Spaceys control-freak realty agent wife (Annette Bening); a mopey disconnected teen-age daughter whod like to see him shot (Thora Birch); the daughters unstable classmate and marijuana entrepreneur next door (Wes Bentley) who keeps camcording her; and the boys Marine colonel father (Chris Cooper) who collects guns and Nazi souvenirs as his wife stares out into space. Only the cheerleader daughters glamorous friend (Mena Suvari) thinks Spacey is cute which inspires him to hilariously start pumping iron in the garage after overhearing the aspiring fashion model note that body toning might make him a sexual possibility. Meanwhile Bening (spectacular in the first recent role to match her early ones) has given up trying to best her work rival (Peter Gallagher) in favor of joining him in post-lunch quickies at the seedy Top Hat motel. The magazine has contributed to Spaceys ""nonperson"" status by forcing him out -- though not before he blackmails his boss for a years severance pay. From this point on this no-longer-head-of-the-household elects to spend his next 42 years (which of course hell never see) doing what he pleases. This decidedly does not include keeping spots off the sofa or listening to Benings arsenal of Bobby Darin and other Tin Pan Alley pop at the dinner table. As usual Spacey gives sardonic snap to every line he delivers from Alan Balls model-of-structure screenplay yet the movie isnt a repository of cheap shots. Coopers character (what a contrast to October Sky this is) isnt quite what we initially perceive him to be nor is the daughters glamorous friend -- whose key scene at the end is among the movies most brilliant. From Conrad Halls photography to Thomas Newmans score to at least five performances that could justify Oscar nominations the movie is a beaut. Its as feeling as it is funny a quality recent movies seemed to have lost.

I got that feeling in just about every frame of American Beauty. Its an exquisitely designed rather kinky tragicomedy set in a nameless American suburb and its images have a velvety saturated richness as if life had become a candyland of upward mobility. This vaguely ominous Pop-art suburbia a Twilight Zone cross between the 50s and the present is the latest variation on the ones in Blue Velvet Edward Scissorhands The Truman Show and Happiness. Its middle-class America as paradise plastic prison and reverie all at the same time. The director Sam Mendes is a British theater director making his screen debut and though its obvious that hes going to lose no time digging into the corrupt wormy underbelly of this pristine landscape Mendes also cherishes the sensual and dramatic possibilities of a stylized tract-house fantasia. American Beauty is about a ""normal"" nuclear family whose members are drowning in pain because theyve lost the ability to see beyond exteriors and the film lays bare the dreams that they covet. Mendes has a filmmakers essential seductive gift He doesnt just tell a story -- he gives great surface. Lester and Carolyn Burnham (Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening) may have been in love once but theyve grown distant and terse and their distance has turned to poison. Its no wonder that their daughter Jane (Thora Birch) has turned out to be one of those sulky selfish teenagers with exquisite radar and a scowl smeared across her delicate features. Lester works as a corporate slave at a media-marketing magazine and he hates his life -- the drone job the socialite wife who sells real estate and puts a price tag on her feelings the daughter who freezes him out. He jump-starts each day by masturbating in the shower and its all downhill from there. A kind of self-lacerating 90s Willy Loman Lester may sound depressing but Spacey his voice powered by hidden frequencies of soft mockery has a singular ironic gift for making a character downright jaunty about his own misery. At a basketball game Lester and Carolyn stare glumly as Jane cavorts in a halftime cheerleading show. Then right there on the gym floor Lester beholds a vision Angela (Mena Suvari) the blond dirty-delectable American princess. At that moment something snaps; he has never wanted anything more than he wants that girl.

Is this highly touted DreamWorks pet project really the ""Fargo"" ""L.A. Confidential"" and ""Secrets amp; Lies"" of 1999? Does it deserve its fulsome advance praise? And the inevitable accompanying backlash?Yes and no. I was a little mixed about ""American Beauty"" though Ive got to admit its a stunner a scathing dark comedy about corruption and doom in the immaculate boudoirs living rooms and lawns of middle-class suburbia. Its a picture with a great cool shiny surface and it boasts superb actors (Kevin Spacey Annette Bening and a finely chosen ensemble) witty and iconoclastic writing (by Alan Ball of TVs ""Cybill"") vigorous and imaginative direction (by British newcomer Sam Mendes) and brilliantly stylized cinematography (by the great Conrad Hall of ""Cool Hand Luke"" and ""In Cold Blood"").But like its characters the film has a secret flaw a softness at its core. Thats not immediately obvious though. With its caustically funny tale of suburbanites regressing into adolescent madness ""American Beauty"" is the kind of dark comedy that could appeal to even suburban-bred DreamWorks boss Steven Spielberg; its whimsical wish-fulfillment fantasy and bloody nightmare.Cannily and coolly the filmmakers show us typical dad and magazine scribe Lester Burnham (Spacey) dropping out of his soon-to-be-downsized job burning his bridges by insulting and blackmailing the down-sizer and then regressing into drug use burger-flipping and girl-chasing. Meanwhile Lesters inept Realtor wife Carolyn (Bening) flips out into red-hot adultery with local real estate king Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher) and daughter Jane (Thora Birch) starts a psychopathic but sweet affair with Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley) the handsomely creepy drug-dealer and video voyeur next door.The movie sails along on its savage jokes delivered with sardonic zest by Spacey and Bening. Yet its been designed and shot with such shimmeringly beautiful imagery -- gorgeously bleak compositions of sterile suburban environs and creamily lustful dream visions (flesh and rose petals) -- that the effect is strangely mixed celebratory as well as satiric.The ""American Beauty"" of the title is at first glance a delectable little buxom blue-eyed blond cheerleader Janes best high-school friend Angela Hayes (played by Mena Suvari of ""Nowhere""). Angela is such a cliched suburban living doll and her first pompom routine fills Lester with such dreamy lust that he begins pursuing her shamelessly working out in his garage to trim and tone his flabby fortysomething bod. Angela is a little-bit-older Lolita a calculating MTV-era honeybunch who talks casually of wide sexual experience and enjoys heating up her galpals dad. But though shes linked in Lesters dreams with the American Beauty roses Carolyn fanatically grows shes not the only beauty around. The movie arouses typical daydreams only (mostly) to undermine or crush them. It mocks our media-fed delusions while deceptively teasing our media-fed sex fantasies (in this case male female and gay).Like ""The Ice Storm"" which this movie resembles in the way a flashy virtuosic stage musical recalls a dense psychological play on the same theme ""American Beauty"" juxtaposes the world of the adults (glossy hypocritical vicious) with the domain of the wise-cracking yearny kids noxiously discontent Jane and mysterious Ricky who (in a ""Rear Window"" touch) keeps watching and filming her from across the yard. Ricky is played in a manner that deliberately recalls movie psychos like Anthony Perkins Norman Bates -- he has that gangly smiling secretive look -- while still retaining our sympathy. A pot dealer and peeping tom he is also the bullied son of a tantrum-throwing ex-Marine dad (Chris Cooper)and the kid Lester foolishly would like to become.Maybe Ricky is too sympathetic -- even though like everyone else (including Jane) hes a candidate for committing the murder Lester seemingly predicts in the movies opening sentences. Like the narration Billy Wilder wrote for a corpse in ""Sunset Boulevard"" and a dying killer in ""Double Indemnity"" (two clear antecedents for this film) Lesters voice-over jokes about his impending demise suffuse ""Beauty"" with a playful fatalism and jiggle our moral compass.Spacey is the perfect actor for Lester -- and Lester may be his perfect role. Here he holds his two actors aces that smirking slashing wit and his gift for playing soft-centered tough-talking American sell-outs. Its a genuinely urbane funny turn. And hes matched by the nervous full-bodied fervor of Benings Carolyn; her bedroom scene with Gallaghers Kane (""Your Majesty"") is a classic.1 | 2 | Next MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated Articles`American Beauty Should Bloom As Best PictureMarch 17 2000The Theatrical Genius Behind `American BeautyMarch 19 2000Boston Film Festival Honors `Beauty Before Its ReleaseSeptember 13 1999Find More Stories AboutAmerican BeautyDark ComedySam MendesTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter",http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-09-24/entertainment/9909240154_1_spacey-and-bening-lester-burnham-american-beauty,200,americanbeauty29,americanbeauty,chicagotribune
