By Anthony Lane Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl in the new movie from Judd Apatow the director of ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin.""   Credit ROBERT RISKO What relation does Judd Apatows ""Knocked Up"" bear to his previous movie ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin""? It is not a sequel though some of the same actors return for second helpings. Nor is it a companion piece since its research topic has switched from a guy who hasnt had sex but wants it to a guy who has had sex but wishes he hadnt. Indeed since the new film is about the comic if hardly unprecedented results of having unprotected sex let us agree to call it an offshoot. My suspicion is that Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) changed his name having started life as Benjamin Flintstone. All the Freddishness is there the near-maniacal fun-seeking the bearish bulk that will one day (all too soon) congeal into fat and the belief that responsibility is a fine and terrible thing. Ben is a La-Z-Boy in human form who lives with four emotionally stunted losers better known as friends Jonah (Jonah Hill) Jason (Jason Segel) Jay (Jay Baruchel) and Martin (Martin Starr). Note the first names the point being not just that inventing new ones would have been you know a total drag but that it presumably allowed Apatow who wrote as well as directed the film to let the backchat flow on and off the set like a two-way current. Even if the onscreen range of conversation is confined to the use and abuse of the body and even though you may recoil at the outcome Apatow is unquestionably expert at defining people by the particular voltage of their talk as shown by this quintet of slackers. Having dared Martin not to cut his facial hair for example they then spend the rest of the film competing to pinpoint whom he most resembles. ""Scorsese on coke"" makes way for the climactic ""late John Lennon"" although the winner has to be ""You look like Robin Williamss knuckles."" One night Ben goes to a bar picks up a girl and goes to bed with her. Both are drunk at the time and both in consequence throw up Ben the next morning (""I just yakked"" he says winningly over breakfast) and the girl--who is no girl but a young woman named Alison (Katherine Heigl) with a growing career on television--some weeks later into a trash can at work. Here comes the bit that will divide Apatows audience and (he hopes) get them arguing over the movie Alison decides to inform the father and little by little to enfold him and his oafish froggy grin in the gentle business of parenting. Call it the taming of the Shrek. Most women I imagine will scoff with incredulity this is neither a last hurrah (Alison is still in her twenties) nor the ideal time (she has a good job) and Ben is the last slob on earth she would have chosen. Most men meanwhile will be too busy watching through their fingers. To them this is ""The Omen."" Apatow unlike his hero is nothing if not careful born in Syosset New York now living in the Los Angeles area he clearly wants his movies to shock but not to repel a conservative audience and thus the idea of his heroines aborting the child is no sooner floated than dispelled. Indeed as with ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" what follows is a morality play dressed up as a filthy piece of mummery. When Ben takes Alison to meet his pals who are hard at work designing a nudity-in-cinema Web site Jason welcomes her or at least her breasts with the words ""Your bodys reacting really well to the pregnancy; amazing how quickly the milk arrives."" Yet Ben himself is won over and as labor begins it is he primed with natal information who asks her ""Have you had your bloody show?"" To Jason that would be just another Web site. On the surface Apatows films are about sex--obsessively exclusively and exhaustively. (This one lasts more than two hours.) But that is a clever feint for their true subject is age. The title of the last film was a giveaway the dilemma of the Steve Carell character being not that he was a pure maiden but that he remained in effect a lonely child. The problem ramifies and grows unexpectedly touching in ""Knocked Up"" which sports a laid-back honest scene between Ben and his father (Harold Ramis) and any number of acrid exchanges between Alisons older sister Debbie (played by Leslie Mann the directors wife) and her husband Pete (Paul Rudd) as they rip themselves apart over their loss of youth. ""My life is an unfunny version of Everybody Loves Raymond "" Pete confides. He sneaks off to play fantasy baseball as if for a lovers tryst while Debbie and Alison try in vain to get into a night club provoking out of nowhere a devastating speech from the doorman who points out that one of them is pregnant and the other too old. For the record he also informs them that he a black man is forbidden to let the ratio of black customers rise above five per cent. At times like that Apatow is within reach of real bitterness and he may yet make films that kick at the fences erected by society. For the moment however he is too easily tempted by erections of other kinds and to be fair one would hardly wish him to spoil the fondness with which he views his characters. Rather than spiting them he gets other people to laugh at them--hence the dangerous ease with which those in minor roles come to colonize his movies often bearing a quiver of one-liners to which the hero and heroine have no response. Seth Rogen is unceasingly likable as Ben and the puerility of the tale which would otherwise pall for anyone over the mental age of fifteen is somehow redeemed by his tolerant sweetness yet I prefer his supporting turn in ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" where he fired barbs from the fringes of the action to his prominence here. Thank goodness that the sublime narrowness of his cultural references holds firm ""If any of us get laid tonight its because of Eric Bana in Munich "" he tells his drinking buddies which is almost as stirring as his Olivier-like exhortation to Steve Carell on the brink of a pickup--""Be David Caruso in Jade. "" ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" closed with a deflowering as expected but also with a kitsch rendition of ""Aquarius"" by the assembled cast half-mocking its heros newfound ethereal contentment. ""Knocked Up"" is more pleased with itself and I suppose that with a baby due there is no way it was ever going to avoid a sentimental splurge familiar from other birthing films like ""Nine Months"" and ""Parenthood."" The likelihood of Apatows turning into Chris Columbus or Ron Howard however seems refreshingly slight. Besides he has a job to do there are women out there who badly need men to grow up and the men really dont want to so who will referee? The best performance in ""Pirates of the Caribbean At Worlds End"" comes from a monkey. He belongs to the jaunty Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and given that in the course of the film he is required to ignite a rocket freeze his fur off dangle from a parachute and most ignominiously take the place of a cannonball he--or his agent--may well have requested that half his scenes be played by a stunt monkey or at least a monkey double. On the night I saw the film he also earned the most laughs putting more experienced actors to shame. In short the only person who could derive lasting satisfaction from this movie is Charles Darwin. It is the third in the series the first and most engaging film having been spun off from a theme ride at Disneyland. The second though blessed with pleasing inventions was a more ponderous affair but the memory of it is like rarest gossamer compared with the third which takes a hundred and sixty-seven minutes to pummel us into submission. Advice to Johnny Depp fans enjoy a seafood dinner skip the beginning and roll up after half an hour. You wont have missed a thing. It takes that long for his character Captain Jack Sparrow to flounce into view. Jack is marooned in Davy Joness locker--or as we like to say in the overworld ""dead""--and it falls to Barbossa aided by Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) to fetch him back. This means sailing through polar ice floes plunging over a waterfall and winding up on a barren strand; or if you are the director Gore Verbinski it means putting your blockbustering on hold while you try your hand at an art movie. Not a good idea. Thus we get Jacks vessel stuck in a blinding salt desert with stones that turn into crabs and not one Johnny Depp but a whole shipful of them who swarm around like the Oompa-Loompas in ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory."" Whether Jack is hallucinating or splitting his personality (neither of which one normally associates with the afterlife) I cannot say but the result is a multimillion-dollar retread of Bunuels ""Simon of the Desert"" without a scrap of Bunuels coruscation. There is no denying the ability of Verbinskis production designers to conjure credible textures--slime steam and desiccation play their part with a group of characters emerging from dark unctuous waters like Martin Sheen in ""Apocalypse Now""--but when the beat of the story varies so wildly those finely worked surfaces lose all power of suggestion and the film descends into an indiscriminate soup. Apart from a Singapore-based pirate named Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fat) most of the figures here will be familiar Davy Jones himself (Bill Nighy) the starchy Lord Beckett (Tom Hollander) and Wills late father Bootstrap Bill (Stellan Skarsgard) who more than ever strikes me as half man half bouillabaisse. A subplot requires Will to save Bill by getting hold of the Black Pearl but for the life of me I couldnt remember whether the Pearl was a man-of-war a precious stone or a sex toy--or for that matter whose heart was in the treasure chest and which sailor at any given moment was on board which damn ship. At the climax two vessels get their rigging entwined on the rim of a whirlpool which sounds impressive but give me a hot bath an open plughole and a pair of rubber ducks and I could have laid out the situation more efficiently. As ""Spider-Man 3"" has proved rumpus minus cohesion equals mess. The people making these sequels are so drenched in the saga that they commit the fatal error of presuming that we are in the same boat--that we have spotless recall of every twist in the earlier films and can barely breathe because of our desperation for more. What they fail to realize is that big summer movies even the successful ones are designed to be forgettable passing through our system at precisely the same rate as a pint of Pepsi. Nothing is left but fizzing nerve ends and a sugary soupcon of rot. At one point in ""Pirates of the Caribbean At Wits End"" as it must surely come to be known a sailor asks of Jack ""Do you think he plans it out or just makes it all up as he goes along?"" This is a false distinction. Even Depps ad-libs now have a prepackaged air and whatever the reserves of ingenuity and cash that were poured into the movie it tends to founder when decisiveness is called for--not unlike Lord Beckett struck dumb as his ship is torn by cannon fire from both sides. The sight of him stepping down off the poop deck with the world blowing to splinters around him is beautifully done and his lordship like many of those present looks content to be rid of the absurdities that have reduced the ""Pirates"" franchise from jollity to wreck. The theme ride is now a ride without a theme. ""Gentlemen I wash my hands of this weirdness"" Captain Jack says. Sir you speak for us all.

Depp as Jack Sparrow is residing in Davy Joness locker--i.e. hes dead--where he is the solitary captain of a landlocked Black Pearl and subject to hallucinations. In his visions every crew member looks like Johnny Depp and in fact is Johnny Depp but if you think that 10 versions of the scene-stealing star will increase your enjoyment tenfold think again. Sparrow I am sorry to say does not get one explosive laugh in the entire 168 minutes of this loud cluttered and confusing sequel. More is not merrier.The plot is not only hard to follow there seems to be nothing real at stake. Half the characters are already dead and half the movie seems to involve swordfights with dead people who cant be killed with swords. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley expended their chemistry in the first and best ""Pirates""; by now their love story is running on dead batteries. One gets a brief flicker of hope when Keith Richards shows up as Jacks well-weathered dad but hes given almost nothing to do. The longest grimmest and least funny of the trilogy ""At Worlds End"" is best rationalized by the odiously corporate Lord Beckett whose East India Trading company threatens to end the colorful world of piracy. His villainy he insists ""isnt personal. Its just business."" Indeed.

Here it is The apparently inexorable march of the sequels (Spidey 3 Shrek the Third already with Oceans Thirteen and Bourne something or other speeding toward us all began with a pretty novel (or at least entertaining) first film. You can extend that observation to lots of other series--Superman Batman Die Hard (which is also being recycled in a few weeks). Trapped in a theater with the visual effects flaming all around you and the make-up artists trying to top themselves with increasingly yucky creations theres not much you can do except close your eyes and nostalgize the not very distant past when Johnny Depp and friends first offered their cheeky variants on the long-dormant pirate genre. If by some miracle you doze off--hard to do with the thunderous score continually throbbing and the yelling and explosions respectively yammering and thundering--dont worry. Wide awake you cant follow this story. Theyre everywhere these not-so-merry miscreants -- in Singapore in Antarctica on a desert island in a secret pirate cove riding mid-ocean waterfalls (very odd that bit) exchanging broadsides while being whirled about in a maelstrom. It is very exhausting and it makes no sense whatsoever. From time to time the action stops dead in order for the actors to sneer and bellow at one another--lots of traditional ""Avast me hearties"" dialogue which tends to remind us that Errol Flynn and his hammy crews used to do this sort of thing with more brio and fewer special effects. If Pirates III can be said to have an emotional center -- oops sorry how did that bit of middlebrow critical jargon worm its way into this context? -- it has to do with father figures. They come and they go causing a good deal of consternation among their offspring. The codger most appreciated by the audience is Keith Richards well known to be Depps inspiration for his character. He appears here as Jack Sparrows old man and he got a relieved round of applause at the screening I attended. Up to then the audience had been pretending to have a good time even though it was succumbing to an increasingly sullen silence. But the old boy with his grumbling voice a few licks on a guitar-like instrument and his quite uncanny resemblance to Depp (at least in pirate drag) got their motors running for a few minutes. You wish theyd given Richards more to do if only to let us gaze more deeply at the noble ruin. Matter of fact you wish theyd given Depp more to do. He enters the film quite late and as usual his performance is a canny blend of the minimal and the maximal. What laughs the films offer derive from his work which consists of putting a kind of ironic post-modernist spin on the antique conventions of the Yo-Ho-Ho genre. At one point in the proceedings someone asks of Sparrow ""Do you think he plans it all out or just makes it up as he goes along?"" Good question and one thats easily answered. Hes a very smart and disciplined actor. You always sense that he knows exactly what hes doing that nothing careless or wildly improvisational is being tossed into his performance. On the other hand if you asked that question of the screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio and the director Gore Verbinski the answer would be different For their film is not so much thought out as strung together -- colorful incident upon colorful incident but without logic gathering suspense or any attempt to establish emotional connections between audience and actors. I must say its as boring to type out criticism of that kind as it probably is to read it since some close variant of it could be written week-in week-out every summer movie season. Its tempting to conclude with a joke about the title Maybe they should have called it Pirates of the Caribbean At Wits End. But no in the movies epilogue Jack Sparrow is seen setting forth in a dinghy chasing his pirate ship which has been mysteriously purloined. It is shall we say an open-ended ending. God help us we silently whimper. You mean theyre leaving the door open for another one? And another.

The very first shot of a hangmans noose is followed by what promises to be a musical about capital punishment in the 19th century. Among a group of prisoners waiting to die is a grim-faced little boy who like the hero of ""Oliver"" relieves his anxiety not to mention the discomfort of his rope-wrapped neck by bursting into song. When other prisoners take up the boys plaintive melody a British officer rushes off to tell his superior cryptically ""Theyve started to sing sir"" to which the superior replies with equally cryptic pithiness ""Finally."" ENLARGE Now nothing in this bleak sequence has any bearing on the rest of the film; the whole thing is there simply to illustrate the point that civil rights have been suspended and all pirates are to be hanged. But I cared about that little boy. I liked his courage wondered what he had done to deserve such a fate and would have preferred his presumably brief life story to the cruel and unusual punishment of a ponderous pirate saga 168 minutes long with more doldrums than ""The Rime of the Ancient Mariner."" Those doldrums are relieved from time to time by spectacular effects -- an international pirate convocation at a blighted Bali Hai called Shipwreck Cove; white rocks turning into crabs; crabs by the digital thousands covering a ships deck a climactic sea battle fought on the rim of a ship-sucking maelstrom. Still the most affecting effect is one of the simplest -- Bill Nighys octopus-pussed Davy Jones wiping away a single tear with the tip of a tentacle. Jack Sparrow is less of a presence than before though Johnny Depp remains the saving grace of the series whether hes weaving woozily long after the deck beneath him has ceased to pitch or flouncing around as if managing an invisible hoop skirt. Keith Richards supposedly the inspiration for Mr. Depps characterization is there in the leathery flesh but very briefly and to no effect; we might just as well be watching a coarsely carved puppet. Chow Yun-Fat does a turgid turn as a Chinese pirate captain. Geoffrey Rush is back as Barbosa and a good thing too because his diamond-drill voice is one of the few that can cut through the movies clamor. And Keira Knightleys Elizabeth Swann and Orlando Blooms Will Turner go through the tortures of the damned in their search for love -- if the story is about nothing else its about betrayal. The story is about other things of course but the plots absurd complications defy and discourage description. To learn more you could peruse the movies Web site. Or perish the thought you could see the movie. Golden Door ENLARGE Aurora Quattrocchi and Vincenzo Amato play a mother and son who come to America in Emanuele Crialeses Golden Door. The first shot of Emanuele Crialeses remarkable ""Golden Door"" presents a tantalizing mystery -- two men climbing in barren terrain with stones in their mouths. This is followed by a pullback that loses the men then finds them again as with a cosmic eye on the rocky face of a mountainside. (Agnes Godard did the dazzling cinematography.) The place is Sicily in the time of Europes tidal emigration to the New World and the stones in the mouths are traditions of an ancient culture that the men will leave behind. After countless films in which immigration plays a central role -- one of the earliest was Charlie Chaplins 1917 silent classic ""The Immigrant"" while one of the best Jan Troells ""The Emigrants"" has never migrated to DVD -- youd think the canon was essentially complete. Yet this visionary work adds to it by combining harsh realities with magic-realist fantasies. The immigrant family consists of a widower farmer Salvatore (a formidable performance by Vincenzo Amato) his two sons and his elderly mother. Salvatore dreams of an America that produces giant vegetables and a California where he can swim in a river of milk. The movies title is ironic for the door invoked by Emma Lazaruss poem may be golden but reaching it is a hellish experience for Salvatore and his fellow passengers in steerage and getting through it is a soul-searing trial. (In what amounts to a polemic against inhuman treatment the film shows U.S. immigration officers as instruments of a dunderheaded policy based on eugenics.) The films most intriguing element -- a shipboard romance with a mysterious Englishwoman played by Charlotte Gainsbourg -- is its least convincing one. Some of its images and situations though are unforgettable. Long before a white river fills the screen -- and then turns to something else -- you realize youre seeing something new. Angel-A Movies often turn on slender notions worked up to look like full-fledged ideas. Once in a while though a notion will be fertile to begin with a self-renewing source of delight. Thats the case with Luc Bessons ""Angel-A"" a French-language fantasy with good subtitles about a petty skuzzy criminal at the end of his rope and a statuesque chain-smoking blonde who may be his guardian angel or a screwball slut or neither or both. His name is Andre and hes played with astonishing variety and verve by Jamel Debbouze who was seen on American screens late last year as the Algerian soldier with a missing hand in ""Days Of Glory."" (In fact Mr. Debbouze lost his right hand in a childhood accident.) Her name -- or nom de plumes since feathers figure in her comings and goings - is Angela and shes played by Rie Rasmussen a Danish-American beauty with an agile wit who could convince anyone that shes heaven-sent. And sent it would appear from heavens department of self-esteem Angela works hard and well to help the mendacious self-loathing Andre solve the problems of his life by feeling better about himself. This movie will make you feel better about life in general and in particular about Paris which has never looked more magnificent than in Thierry Arbogasts cinematography. The process he used removes all the colors and replaces them with luminous shades of gray. Its called black-and-white.    DVD TIP Jamel Debbouze played Lucien the simple-minded boy who works for the nasty neighborhood grocer in Jean-Pierre Jeunets ""Amelie"" (2001) which starred Audrey Tautou as the telepathic but touchingly fragile heroine of the title.

By Dana Stevens To listen to Slates Spoiler Special about Spider-Man 3 click the arrow button on the player below You can also click here to download the MP3 file or you can subscribe to the Spoiler Special podcast feed in iTunes by clicking here. Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom in At Worlds End With Pirates of the Caribbean At Worlds End the summer blockbuster begins to approach the level of pure abstraction. Adrift in the windless seas of its 168-minute running time the viewer passes through confusion and boredom into a state of Buddhist passivity. Swords are crossed swashes buckled curses lifted only to descend again. People marry die come back to life transform willy-nilly into barnacle-encrusted ghouls. There are reasons why all this is happening reasons that might be clear if youve recently pored over the previous 294 minutes of pirate lore. Like all abstract art At Worlds End is best approached non-narratively as an experience rather than a story. Still since that experience will cost you 10 and nearly three hours of your life Ill try to sort through the flotsam and make sense of the thing. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. As the film opens Lord Beckett (Tom Hollander) the head of the British East India company whose crisp powdered wig is evidence enough of his villainy announces a kind of 18th-century version of the Patriot Act The right of habeas corpus has been suspended and anyone suspected of piracy--not excluding cute Dickensian urchins singing sea chanteys--has been sentenced to hang. Advertisement The only pirates not in this lineup are the ones we care about Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) Capt. Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and the crew of the Black Pearl. Theyre down in Singapore battling a Chinese pirate (Chow Yun-Fat) for the possession of a mysterious map. That procured they sail for the Land of the Dead to rescue Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) who if youll consult your glossary sacrificed himself to the jaws of a sea monster at the end of the last installment. But dying in the Pirates of the Caribbean world is sort of like being audited by the IRS Sure its a drag but as long as you talk to the right people and pony up the loot itll be over with soon enough. The tax lawyer for the Black Pearl crew is Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris) a voodoo priestess who it turns out happens to be the sea goddess Calypso in human form hence her power to revive the dead. She was once the lover of Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) captain of the Flying Dutchman who pursuant to some unspecified betrayal has been cursed to wear a rubber octopus face that obscures what a good actor Bill Nighy actually is. Oh I almost forgot Will Turner wants to rescue his father (Stellan Skarsgard) from a curse thats made him part of the hull of the Flying Dutchman. Skarsgard in one short scene with Bloom provides the films most moving moment as the melancholy amnesiac Bootstrap Bill. There are more subplots involving Elizabeths father Gov. Swann (Jonathan Pryce) her former suitor Norrington (Jack Davenport) and the ever-shifting location of a trunk containing Davy Jones heart but elucidating them would make this review longer than Middlemarch. The geeky intricacy of all this plot arcana no doubt accounts for a part of the franchises appeal. Theres a scene about two-thirds of the way through in which pirate representatives of various nations meet to elect a king that resembles the late Star Wars movies with their endless council discussions and legislative wrangling. At Worlds End was shot simultaneously with the second Pirates installment Lord of the Rings-style but that doesnt keep either film from seeming made up as the crew went along. Still the director Gore Verbinski does have a touch with big action sequences particularly stunts involving the physics of the human body in motion flung from catapults coasting down zip lines swinging from masts and so forth. Some of the physical gags in Pirates almost recall Buster Keaton with the important exception that Keaton was actually doing this stuff. The combination of stunt doubles and CGI enhancement that enables Verbinskis gee-whillikers battle scenes somehow drains the joy out of even the niftiest tricks--but maybe thats just me. Even when Johnny Depp is being milked for cuteness as he is here his Jack Sparrow remains a bizarre antic creation an effeminate Falstaff as played by a spray-tanned Errol Flynn. Keith Richards whom Depp has cited as one of his original inspirations for the character appears in a cameo as Jacks grizzled father Capt. Teague provoking inevitable fantasies of a sequel in which Jack snorts his dads ashes after the old pirate falls out of a coconut tree. The final destination on that much-fought-over map--not to mention a juicy tidbit thats revealed after the interminable closing credits--both hint that a fourth film might not be out of the question if this one rakes in doubloons the way the first two did. Apparently cursed seafarers arent the only thing capable of coming back from the dead if the price is right. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor May 25 2007 Save for later Saved The first two ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movies are among the biggest commercial phenomenons in the history of movies. Together theyve grossed more than a billion dollars. Thats a lot of doubloons.But does anybody really think these films especially the last one ""Dead Mans Chest"" are all that wonderful? The third installment ""Pirates of the Caribbean At Worlds End"" was filmed back to back with its predecessor and the best you can say is that its somewhat more enjoyable.It seems that the East India Company which controls Davy Joness Flying Dutchman rules the waves and only the Nine Lords of the Brethren Court can defeat the armada. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? It didnt look to me as if this one is set up for a sequel but who knows? Another billion could change anyones mind. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 One thing is for sure The ""Pirates"" movies have been getting longer going from 133 minutes in 2003 to 150 with the 2006 sequel to 168 for the third installment. Thats a lot of yo-ho-ho-ing.I enjoyed the first film because of Johnny Depps fey flamboyance as Capt. Jack Sparrow - he carried the whole special-effects heavy enterprise on his thin shoulders. He had less to do in the second film and was less comically inventive. To compensate director Gore Verbinski piled on the gross-outs - there was way too much of octopus-faced Davy Jones.Fortunately Verbinski doesnt make the same mistake here. I didnt feel as I did last time that I was trapped inside a thrill-less thrill ride. But hes made a new mistake In order to tie up all the loose plot lines from the first two films Verbinski and screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio throw so much story at us that the nonstop action becomes deadening.If you go to these movies purely for the lalapalooza effects none of this may matter. But the filmmakers are making the rather large assumption that just because the movies are megahits we want to know everything about everybody in them. They dont realize that a commercial smash is not the same thing as a classic.I cared about what happened to Jack Sparrow but does anybody really care about the fates of Will Turner (pallid-as-usual Orlando Bloom) Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) or Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush good as he is)?And yes Keith Richards has a blah cameo as Sparrows father. Blink and youll miss it.Verbinski tries to give the shenanigans a semblance of seriousness by framing the story as an end of the age of piracy saga but he neednt have bothered. The elegiac tone doesnt exactly suit his temperament - or to be more precise producer Jerry Bruckheimers.""At Worlds End"" is not without its occasional visual flourishes such as the virtuoso nighttime image of upturned pirate bodies floating en masse like specters on a calm sea. Its a wisp of poetry in a storm of pulp. And Depp and Rush are still in there plugging away. Theyre troupers but the series is all used up. If there is to be another sequel it will have to be called ""Pirates of the Caribbean - At Wits End."" Grade B- Rated PG-13 for action violence.

(By Stephen Vaughan -- Disney Enterprises) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Thursday May 24 2007 Funner biggerer brightererer bolderer ""Pirates of the Caribbean At Worlds End"" is not only okay it may even be close to good. A lavish spectacle illuminated by Johnny Depps swishing as a slightly dainty pirate captain with better makeup than Paris Hilton the movie has its dull moments but not a lot of them. Longer than the second ""Ice Age"" can it possibly be worth recapping? Hmm if you insist. If I fall asleep about paragraph 17 a gentle nudge please. To begin with our hero from films one and two Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp) is dead. Not to worry. This is a movie based after all on a ride not a story so there are no rules and no reason why Jack cant be fetched from the grim land he now inhabits. A real-world crisis threatens the pirates who for some politically incorrect reason have become the symbols of freedom and individuality in a colonial world run by the jackbooted thugs of the East India Company so Jacks compadres decide he must be rescued to sail the Black Pearl to naval victory. Thus the first hour -- the film opens in Washington this evening -- is spent in a kind of spectacularly surrealistic afterlife only visitable by sailing off the end of the world. Think Niagara. Think uh-oh its going to get wet soon very wet. Sailing a Chinese junk borrowed from the famous pirate Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fat at last in a hit) the rescuers include all the usual suspects. Theres Keira Knightley so beautiful and spunky it makes your fillings ache Orlando Bloom 30 going on 15 and the great Geoffrey Rush chewing the scenery as if its pure protein (he may even slip in a genuine ""Arrrghhhh""). When all these talents finally wash ashore they find themselves in a barren featureless plain -- it looks like a warm Antarctica as set-designed by Jean-Paul Sartre. Suddenly Jack Sparrow himself comes sailing over the crest of the hills -- the Black Pearl is moving across the flats using the power of crabs who turn themselves into tank treads. Put that in your I-never-thought-Id-see file Restored more or less to life (I leave out the best trick when the ship somehow sinks to the surface) Sparrow and his former foe and eternal competitor Captain Barbossa (Rush) reach a kind of rapprochement in executive management policy given the crisis and all. The crisis? The Company has united with Davy Jones (Bill Nighy behind some kind of ucky squid face) and the Flying Dutchman to wipe out the pirates who are headquartered at a Caribbean harbor called Shipwreck Cove. It falls to Captain Jack and the others to unite their own fractious bunch of gargoyle-faced barnacle-souled ruffians into a coherent fighting force to make the world safe for slaughter rapine pillage destruction of property keelhauling and buried treasure. So that leaves out only 20 or so minor subplots -- the love affair off and on again between Bloom and Knightley the reconciliation of Jack Sparrow and his pa Teague Sparrow (Rolling Stone Keith Richards who else?) Chows increasing fluency in English the evil Englishman and true villain Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) the importunings of a beautiful tattooed black woman named Calypso who turns out to be a 30-foot-tall goddess the politics of piracy -- each of which kicks in another 15 or 20 minutes of run time. Total 168. You could do your income taxes in that amount of time. But its worth it. Depps fey foppery is endlessly amusing particularly when his arms flapping he trips the light fantastic from this place to that. Youve never seen so many contrapuntal rhythms. His flirty eye movement and prehensile ironic lids the flightiness of his fingertips; its all very funny in the key of ""The Birdcage."" And this is truly a beautifully designed movie. The first third set in and around old Singapore has a romantic Oriental brilliance to it starlit and mysterious. Now and then a scene leaps out at you. Depp commanding his ship (crewed by replications of Depp) in the desert of the afterworld will linger in your imagination as well as a startling scene where that nights harvest of the sea -- those whove died -- are intercepted on their way to Davy Joness locker each in a single rowboat each with a single lantern on a placid glowing surface. Then theres the acting all of it splendidly hammy and yummy with one severe exception. I would single out Hollander as the nasty English lord. Everyone else has the advantage of elaborate makeup and outfit by which to make an impression yet few register as precisely as Hollander. His demeanor is absolute icy calmness no matter what is occurring. He refuses to be startled cowed intimidated or uncertain. He has the granite solidarity of the empire he serves. Yet all this is accomplished not by a man of towering beauty and charisma but by a rather ordinary chap whose personality dominates all the festooned dingbats who come before him. And finally theres a last fight a real lulu. Its a sea battle in a maelstrom between the Black Pearl and the new British command vessel the Flying Dutchman heavily armed but rotting. The two heavy sea-beasts spin about the centrifugally driven speed of the water angling to come within broadside range and send a barrage of 18-pound ball across the narrow distance; when their masts cross airborne troops swing from yardarm to yardarm to light on the enemy deck and put steel to crew. Its a wonderfully planned and executed battle that captures exactly the color and glamour of the old-fashioned kind on the back lot at Warners where Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone skewered and counter-skewered each other. Yet its also amplified by the most gargantuan yet amusing CGI-driven backdrop and imagery all cut to the speed of a tinkers dance. Against this the problems are small. Too many post-battle cute endings (about six; feels like 24). Then the director Gore Verbinski (he directed the first two as well) doesnt get much out of the Depp/Richards meet; these two versions of each other ought to really get some mojo working. The Bloom-Knightley game could be sprightlier. But its the first ""Pirates"" movie Ive walked out of without thinking ""Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of Tums."" Pirates of the Caribbean (168 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for mild but vigorous violence and scenes of monsters and other frightening images.

"Pirates Not shipshape | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesPirates Not shipshapeAside from a couple of stirring old-school pirate battles and that same mugging monkey Pirates of the Caribbean At Worlds End is dismally deathly dull.Rival pirate captains Sparrow and Barbossa (Johnny Depp left and Geoffrey Rush) play my-spyglass-is-bigger-than-yours in <i>Pirates of the Caribbean At Worlds End.</i>By Rob SalemTelevision CriticThu. May 24 2007Starring Johnny Depp Geoffrey Rush Orlando Bloom Keira Knightley and Bill Nighy. Written by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio. Directed by Gore Verbinski. 168 minutes. At major theatres. PGEver been to sea Billy?I mean really out to sea on the actual ocean as opposed to the shallow animatronics approximation that is the basis of the lucrative Pirates of the Caribbean film franchise - now hopefully (but by no means certainly) concluding with a third instalment Pirates of the Caribbean At Worlds End which jumps the gun (even as it walks the plank) with across-the-continent public showings tonight in advance of tomorrows ""opening.""Oh how we scoffed back in 2003 at the very notion of a feature film based on a creaky old theme-park attraction - wasnt that supposed to work the other way around?Not this time anyway thanks to the courageous comedic commitment of two actors actors Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush a digitally desiccated horde of boneyard buccaneers (and their undead monkey mascot) and perhaps somewhat also to the doe-eyed charms of chemistry-challenged love interests Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley.Article Continued BelowThe original Pirates of the Caribbean Curse of the Black Pearl was a well-deserved and largely unexpected hit. The second Dead Mans Chest while sporadically entertaining was a confused and overlong mish-mash. The third At Worlds End shot immediately thereafter is even longer - a butt-barnacling 2 hours and 48 minutes - and even more confusing. Worse yet aside from a couple of stirring old-school pirate battles and that same mugging monkey the movie is dismally deathly dull. Which brings us back to that real-life ocean voyage the best metaphor I can come up with for the essential arc of the entire Pirates trilogy (again we can only hope - there is reason to suspect otherwise).Like an actual ocean voyage the first leg of the Pirates trip was a giddy somewhat disorienting experience heightened by our anticipatory excitement and the thrill of the unknown. Then came the middle part through becalmed deeper murkier waters which initially made you feel a bit queasy then flattened out into an endless featureless vista of not very much of anything at all. The second movie tossed the old horde overboard to make room for new decaying pirates made of bits and pieces of fish and ships. It also gave us a new actors actor the usually admirably understated Bill Nighy managing to emote even through layers of wriggling digital tentacles as the doomed Davy Jones. And there was still Depp and his undeniably entertaining prancing sot of a sea captain. And now we find ourselves nearing the end of our voyage increasingly bored and listless and anxious to get the hell off this damned boat feeling all parched and dehydrated inside and sodden and damp and mildewed outside in places that are very hard to reach. Its not all bad. This time out we get Nighy (his squidly tentacles even more agitated) Rush (no longer quite dead) and Depp which almost makes up for the fact that the writers having so ridiculously padded out Dead Mans Chest suddenly have no idea whatsoever to do with the two attractive young people let alone the other new characters they have introduced.And that includes the wasted and pointless Keith Richards cameo youve heard so much about (hidden behind a prosthetic nose large enough for him to have inhaled his father before he was cremated). Their combined efforts notwithstanding the movie is relentlessly dense and unfathomable; Depp the heart and soul of the series doesnt even show up till several reels in (and then ad nauseum) and would now seem to be in another movie entirely his reeling riotous Capt. Jack now sadly somehow out of his depth (or rather Depp-th).This is not your fathers pirate movie. Hard to believe its even Uncle Walts. The film opens with the public hanging of a scruffy young singing street urchin with the face and voice of an angel sentenced to die just for consorting with pirate types.Now you tell me what kid in his right mind is ever going to want to get on that Disneyland Pirates ride with this image burned into his impressionable young brain?

Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""Pirates of the Caribbean At Worlds End"" with Johnny Depp Geoffrey Rush Orlando Bloom Keira Knightley Chow Yun-Fat Jack Davenport Bill Nighy. Directed by Gore Verbinski from a screenplay by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio based on Walt Disneys ""Pirates of the Caribbean.""168 minutes. Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of action/adventure violence and some frightening images. Opens tonight (8 p.m. or later). Audiences lock up your eyeliner -- Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is back with braids dangling nostrils flaring and swagger-and-flounce gait intact. Alas hes starring in a movie more bloated than his hairstyle and a lot less funny. ""Pirates of the Caribbean At Worlds End"" the final film of Gore Verbinskis theme-park-ride-based trilogy lumbers to the finish line as a triumph of spectacle over story character and clarity. The first two movies released in 2003 and 2006 werent exactly subtle models of storytelling (did anyone really understand just what was going on during the second half of ""Dead Mans Chest""?) but they were lively and funny popcorn fare. And Depps endearingly loopy Sparrow a character seemingly made up of twitches and flotsam took the spotlight as a comedic tour de force. But ""Worlds End"" (which opens tonight) seems to forget what the first two films (both huge box-office hits as this one undoubtedly will be) knew so well Captain Jack Sparrow is the movie. Sure Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom are cute as English buttons as the swashbuckling lovebirds Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner; Bill Nighy does a fine job of acting behind the massive beard of quivering tentacles that swathes the chin of sea villain Davy Jones; and Geoffrey Rushs harrumphing (and mysteriously resurrected) Captain Barbossa is a welcome sight. The attention to detail is impressive (watch the nuances in the performance of a tiny costumed monkey) and the special effects top-notch. And yes Keith Richards turns up for an underwhelming two minutes or so. But really. Without Depp all of this is filler -- expensive showy and entertaining filler to be precise. At the end of the second film Sparrow was left trapped in Davy Jones Locker so as ""Worlds End"" begins hes quite absent. The film flails about for more than half an hour before he shows up and its like being on a roller coaster without ever taking a sudden dip; after a while its dull. And when Sparrow finally appears starring in what appears to be a strange pirate version of ""Being John Malkovich"" (being in Davy Jones Locker apparently can do that to a person) its almost too late. The swirling out-of-control plot has taken charge of the movie. Depp never quite wrests it back despite his best efforts. Screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio seem to have lost interest in him as a character; instead they devote much of the films running time to the ever-shifting factions that seem to be at constant battle. These include the British merchants of the East India company as well as a random group of pirate-types who own some mysterious pieces of eight not to mention a gang of Singapore pirates led by Captain Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fat given little screen time) and lots of seemingly random rabble-rousers. You may well lose track of whos fighting for whom and it doesnt really matter ""At Worlds End"" goes by in a blur of swords waves and piratical snarling. Amidst all this action including a vast and very wet climactic battle at sea Sparrow almost gets lost. This film is less comedic and more sweeping than the first two and Depp often seems to be strolling the borders of the film commenting on it. (As does Naomie Harris as the human embodiment of the sea goddess Calypso; she walks around perpetually intoning words of doom like an unwelcome party guest.) Much of the pleasure of the first two movies was their silliness; by contrast ""At Worlds End"" takes itself more seriously than a movie based on a theme-park ride probably should. Nonetheless the film is entertaining enough to go down with popcorn; all those raggedy costumes (Knightley it should be noted looks smashing in her wide-belted pirate garb) and sword-flying minions create a spectacle from which its hard to look away. (As of course does Depp who late in the film shoots Knightley a look of jaunty regret thats almost a movie in itself.) But you might shiver a bit at the draft caused by the door at the end thats left wide open for yet another sequel. Like ""Shrek"" another franchise that ran out of energy by its third installment this ""Pirates"" ship has surely sailed its last and Jack Sparrow may now alas be too much of a good thing. ""I wash my hands of this weirdness"" he says early on; maybe it wasnt just the character who was speaking.

"Pirates of the Caribbean Avast there mateys - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizePirates of the Caribbean Avast there mateysAT WORLDS END SAVES BEST FOR LASTBy Bruce NewmanMercury NewsPosted 05/24/2007 045645 AM PDTUpdated 06/22/2007 032617 PM PDT For nearly two hours ""Pirates of the Caribbean At Worlds End"" follows a wearying pattern in which its stars are captured threatened with death then escape turning the tables until its time for the next reversal. Captives become captors the vanquished are victorious. Its a tiresome little cha-cha-cha. But then ""Worlds End"" veers sharply from its threatened destination erupting into a grand and glorious adventure at the final hour. After lying dead in the water during much of its three-part odyssey ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" has saved the best for last. The third time is the charmer. Because this is a franchise governed by people who frequently mistake movement for action and the boho buccaneering of Johnny Depps Capt. Jack Sparrow for comedy the real treasure hunt in ""Worlds End"" is the one the writers undertake in search of a story. They finally find one just outside Shipwreck Cove where Keira Knightley (as Elizabeth Swann the perpetual lady-in-waiting-for-something-to-do) grabs the movies scruffy plot by the neck and shakes it out of its stupor. Already dressed to kill as a Chinese princess (long story) she transforms herself into the picture of a Pirate Queen with a speech that swashbuckles your knees. Its a little bit Henry V at Agincourt with the kicky feel of Madonna leading a cruise ship jazzercise class. Among the characters this brings thrillingly to life is Jack Sparrow himself who had been adrift on Depps increasingly rummy reading of the role.Advertisement Capn Jack is also galvanized by words of advice from his father on the possibility of becoming immortal. (You may find out who plays this part from someone but it wont be from me.) ""Its not just about living forever Jackie"" says the senior Sparrow. ""Its about living with yourself forever."" And that changes everything. Ordinarily such Kumbaya moments are the last thing you want in a pirate movie but this one takes place during a very cool conclave called the Brethren Court which is also the event that brings all of the movies important characters together in one place for the first time. Along the way the lesson we learn is that in this installment no one can be trusted. Will (Orlando Bloom the first talking piece of wood with box office receipts - from this and the ""Lord of the Rings"" series - in excess of 2 billion) tells Elizabeth that she is not to be trusted because she left Jack to die at the end of the last movie. He also confides to Sao Feng - a pirate captain whose black heart is as filled with greed as his face is filigreed - that hes willing to betray Sparrow in order to save his father Bootstrap Bill (Stellan Skarsgaard) a human terrarium attached to the inner hull of the Flying Dutchman. And Sparrow is selling everybody out as fast as he can. Theres a half hour of movie before we see Depp rise from the deep where he was last seen in ""Dead Mans Chest."" The previous installment of the ""Pirates"" trilogy suffered from similar plot drift and limped home with barely a billion dollars at the box office - the third biggest haul of all time. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer is obviously gunning for the top spot and Chow Yun-Fat has been brought in as Sao Feng to shore up any softness in the Asian markets. Hes prone to chewing the scenery and is one of the armada of men sent forth in this movie to kiss Elizabeth Swann. Almost everybody takes a shot. Her last kiss with Will Turner is the only one that matters the one that signals the likelihood of another sequel. Well another wave-riding adventure - preferably a shorter one - with the Pirate Queen doesnt sound half bad. As another wartime ruler once said bring it on. Pirates of the Caribbean At Worlds End Rated PG-13 (intense sequences of action-adventure violence and frightening images) Cast Johnny Depp Orlando Bloom Keira Knightley Geoffrey Rush Chow Yun-Fat Naomie Harris Director Gore Verbinski Writers Ted Elliott Terry Rossio (based on an amusement park ride) Running time 2 hours 45 minutes Contact Bruce Newman at bnewmanmercurynews.com or (408) 920-5004.

Not even Keith Richards can keep this dud afloat. 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Pirates of the Caribbean At Worlds End Adventure. Starring Johnny Depp Orlando Bloom Geoffrey Rush and Keira Knightley. Directed by Gore Verbinski. (PG-13. 168 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. See complete movie listings and show times and buy tickets for select theaters at SFGate.com/movies.) The competition is enormous but with ""Pirates of the Caribbean At Worlds End"" a case could be made for ""Pirates"" as the worst film series since Thomas Edison got the wacky idea that pictures could move. ""Hellraiser"" the previous titleholder looked as though it might hold onto its crown thanks to its disgusting effects. But the makers of ""Pirates"" cleverly diminished that advantage with gross undead seamen and lots of rotting teeth. And now it overtakes ""Hellraiser"" through sheer length and by a novel new effect The story is so convoluted and impenetrable so impossible to grasp hold of that viewers sit there wondering if theyve had a stroke. Cast your mind back to the first ""Pirates"" movie. That was a little jumbled too but it had the spine of a story A nice guy Will (Orlando Bloom) is trying to rescue his girlfriend Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) who has been kidnapped by pirates. (They love each for a good reason -- theyre the only two people in the entire 18th century who brush their teeth.) Will hooks up with a pirate captain (Johnny Depp) who acts just like Keith Richards and they have an adventure. But ""Pirates 3"" has no narrative throughline no emotional spine. Its a mess and the troubles originated with ""Pirates 2."" In the last installment in order to stretch the movie to epic length and guarantee another sequel the filmmakers introduced new characters and new plotlines tying themselves into a knot they could not undo by the final credits. ""Pirates 3"" has inherited that mess and its an ugly thing to watch the actors have to pick through it. Depp as Captain Jack fares the best because his role is essentially comic. Hes never had to carry the story. But Will and Elizabeth as characters are destroyed. Theyve become a mass of multiple motivations and loyalties. Lacking consistency theyre shoehorned into any configuration that the screenwriters devise to the extent that when we look at them we no longer see Will and Elizabeth. We see Bloom and Knightley gamely struggling to locate a shred of authenticity in their roles. They dont find it and its not their fault. Its not there. Director Gore Verbinski and his team of writers are almost naive in what they expect an audience to latch on to. At the start of the film for example Captain Jack is stuck on an island somewhere. He might never get off. OK so what? The movie introduces some notion about all the pirate leaders needing to come together or else ""the brethren faces extinction."" Uh-huh. And what would be so bad about that? The movies biggest emotional trump card is Wills effort to rescue his father from a death in life (or life in death) aboard a ghost ship. But the movie takes about 45 minutes to reintroduce that story line (from ""Pirates 2"") and it has little dramatic heft especially when we meet Dad (Stellan Skarsgard) and see that hes been turned into a kind of monstrous barnacle. The ""Pirates"" series had one slender emotional thread on which to hang its story cycle -- Will and Elizabeths undying undiminished idealized romance -- and amazingly they damaged it miring it in ambiguity and compromise. In terms of pure adventure theres less of it here than in ""Pirates 2"" -- the action doesnt really start until about two hours in and even then its hard to understand the shifting allegiances or make sense of why the different sides are fighting. For most of the screen time a sour feeling pervades. Everyone seems irritated with the exception of Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbossa who goes through the movie like a man smelling roses while covered in (shall we say) baser substances. His mugging is more subtle than Depps but in a way its funnier though to talk about performances is a little beside the point. Everyone is hostage to the screenplay. Everyone is on a boat that has already gone off a cliff. Keith Richards provides the movies only pure pleasure with a cameo as Captain Jacks father. The rest of the movies amusements are unintended. Theres the fun for example of watching Naomie Harris as Tia Dalma make her West Indies accent thicker and thicker and thicker until shes barely comprehensible and how she uses the most portentous delivery for dialogue made up almost entirely of non sequiturs. Also diverting in a sorry sort of way is the moment in the first scene when we discover that habeas corpus has been suspended by the evil Lord Cutler (Tom Hollander). Wait. Does that mean if we like habeas corpus were supposed to like ""Pirates 3"" too? But best of all are Verbinskis repeated long shots of the sailing ship accompanied invariably by a soaring mens chorus on the soundtrack. Verbinski uses the shots as bridges between scenes designed to assure audiences that ""Pirates 3"" has grandeur and continuity. It has neither. -- Advisory This film contains violence.

Jack Sparrow are one of the few things keeping this third - and very long - ""Pirates"" caper above water.By Carrie Rickey Inquirer Movie CriticPosted May 24 2007When Jack Sparrow is at the wheel Pirates of the Caribbean At Worlds End scores as the joyride of joyrides. But ultimately the voyage is so choppy and long (2 hours 48 minutes) that into the third hour I found myself yawning ""Yo-ho-hum and a very sore bum."" The three-quel is an improvement over the soggy sorry second installment of POTC. For one thing Geoffrey Rush returns as Capt. Barbossa. As he verbally spars with the pixilated Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) you would think that with their poetic cadences upthrust chins and rascally swaggers they were playing Shakespeare. For another the supremely charismatic Chow Yun-Fat (Crouching Tiger Curse of the Golden Flower) is aboard as Capt. Sao Feng. The Singapore-based buccaneer has eyes for Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley looking great in slouch boots) who it seems no longer has eyes for Will Turner (Orlando Bloom the human Bermuda Triangle sucking the life out of these action-adventure flicks). The film is set in an era when the armada of the East India Co. hangs pirates to make the seven seas safe for its corporate endeavors. Barbossa Feng and Sparrow are three of nine freebooters united to preserve the pirate way of life. Or would be if anyone could find Sparrow hostage of Davy Jones Locker a kind of saltwater anteroom of hell. Here the seas are high in more ways than one. The movie finds Jack - some time before his pirate brethren do - as hes experiencing the effects of demon rum. Jacks imaginary vessel has run aground in the desert sands a striking image that brings to mind the title structure in Howls Moving Castle. Jack spits at his hallucinations which include a goateed and dreadlocked crew of himselves ""I wash my hands of this weirdness"" Mores the pity for his visions with their affectionate satires of Being John Malkovich The Gold Rush and Master and Commander are the tastiest passages in the overdone picture. What does it say about Gore Verbinskis movie that Jacks delusions are the most coherent thing? That the visual jokes are of the my-spyglass-is-bigger-than-yours variety? That not even the most extreme POTC-head can follow what in the Jolly Roger is going on? Like Disney World home of the theme-park ride that spawned this film franchise POTC3 is unequally divided between princess and pirate attractions. There are the few sequences when Swann and Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris) advance the plot and the many when the captains fight for the helm. Verbinski fails to establish anything like a consistent tone or rhythm. For no particular reason the film is bathed in that serious moonlight blue of the battle of Helms Deep in Lord of the Rings or gets drowned in the sepulchral green of Tales From the Crypt. The cinematography undermines the films attempt at fun. And while there was some nicely choreographed swordplay in the first POTC here the duelists clunk and clank. One can only imagine what Yun-Fat dazzling swordsman of Crouching Tiger thought of his rust-scaled costars. Such as Orlando Bloom. Like Harrison Ford Bloom stars in two of the most popular movie franchises of all time. Unlike Ford he makes little impression. Is he in fact a hair actor whose golden My Little Pony mane in Lord of the Rings did his work for him? While Bloom seems like an affable-enough guy as an action hero hes passive to the point of pointless. Speaking of rust-scaled yes Keith Richards has a cameo as Jack Sparrows sodden papa looking like a human shipwreck. He offers words of wisdom about immortality which shall not be quoted here and Jack a brief reunion with his long-lost mum. While sorting out which of the brigantines was which in the films climactic battle between The Flying Dutchman and The Black Pearl my thoughts drifted to Jack Sparrow. What more unlikely hero for Disney than this unmoored antihero antithesis of its corporate standard? Jack would seem to be offering his own movie review when he says winking ""Just close your eyes and pretend its a bad dream. Thats how I get by.""Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com. Read her blog Flickgrrl at http//go.philly.com/flickgrrl.

Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) joins the group fighting to save the life of Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) in Pirates of the Caribbean At Worlds End. Photo Peter Mountain Disney Enterprises Pirates of the Caribbean At Worlds End 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Pirates of the Caribbean At Worlds End begins with a mass execution of singing pirates (Arrrrh?) the grimy lot of them led by a sweet-faced boy who stands on a barrel to reach the noose. It ends ... hmm. Hard to say. Because it doesnt technically speaking end. For 167 minutes it crashes toward its inflamed Wagnerian climax in which souls are dispatched lovers are transformed and all sorts of annoying loose ends are tied up in a nice snug sailors hitch. But ""end""? As in ""over""? As in ""There wont be another Pirates of the Caribbean movie ever and you can bet Davy Jones facial calamari""? Dont kid yourself. From two teasing codas (one post-credits) its clear that director Gore Verbinski writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio and those busy elves at Industrial Light and Magic have a few more bits of Pirate booty up their ruffled sleeves. Theres plenty to go around in this third movie which again stars Johnny Depp as the swishbuckling pirate skipper Jack Sparrow. Depp continues to play him as a dance-club inebriate (or is that an inner-ear condition?) in search of a disco ball and he continues to mesmerize If the movie featured nothing but him his mascara and his fuchsia head scarf I would be one happy camper. But there are other elements in play here deadly serious elements most of them involving the same reliance on enchanted gewgaws that drove the plots of the last two Pirates. We have Jacks magic compass which points to the owners dearest desire; we have Davy Jones heart locked in a chest; and we have nine ""pieces of eight"" that hold a mythical spell imprisoning Calypso goddess of the sea in human form. Each piece of eight is owned by one of the nine Pirate Lords. Every now and then this multinational group holds a G9 summit (or ""Brethren Court"") in which various important issues are decided such as how to deal with pagan goddesses on a power kick. Their latest problem is that snitty little Lord Beckett (Tom Hollander) who wont rest until all the pirate brethren are dead and I mean truly dead not traipsing around some surrealist desert afterlife with a bunch of flamboyant alter egos. Thats where we find Jack -- stuck since Dead Mans Chest in the dreamlike confines of Davy Jones locker where he bosses around carbon copies of himself aboard the Black Pearl. Jack and his subconscious enjoy a few wiggy close-ups (Jacks enormous nose pores and all; mini-Jacks hanging out in his beard) which contribute nothing to the narrative but much to his florid appeal. As for everyone else Orlando Bloom reprises his wimpy Will Geoffrey Rush tucks into the meaty Barbossa Bill Nighy booms as the octopod Davy (we even get a glimpse of Nighys own wistful puss) and Keira Knightley does that chin-jutting thing as Elizabeth Wills sometime beloved. There isnt as much tongue-in-cheek humor as there was in the first two Pirates installments mainly because there isnt as much Jack. Characters strut and fret through manful impassioned scenes blabbing on about deals and betrayals like there isnt an audience trying desperately to keep up. Confusion reigns. Horns blare. Hans Zimmers heroic orchestral score huffs ad infinitum. But the third Pirates has tender moments (look for Stellan Skarsgard as Wills barnacle-crusted dad) and smashing ones (nimble swordplay a ship that ""sinks"" to the surface) and if you fix on Depp youll manage fine. Just remember When Elizabeth says ""Its not over"" shes not kidding. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Teva Sale Up to 40% off + free shipping PUMA Mens Tazon 6 Ripstop Sneakers for 40 + free shipping Dicks Sporting Goods Summer Sale Up to 50% off + free shipping Sierra Trading Post Spring amp; Summer Cleanout Up to 95% off Powered by Contests Enter to win concert tickets airfare and hotel More Entertainment News Rolling Stones Lash Out at Donald Trump (Again) Over Song Use Daveed Diggs Renee Elise Goldsberry to Leave Hamilton Broken Social Scene Working on New Album Steve Young of M/A/R/R/S Pump Up the Volume Fame Dead Calvin Harris Taylor Swift Song Co-Write Questions We Still...

Those who love being buffeted by impressive special effects their narrative compass spinning wildly will get their fill with ""Pirates of the Caribbean At Worlds End"" starring Johnny Depp Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom. For the rest the overloaded sequel exhausts without ever satisfying. Cluttered and clattering busy with jokes that never bob to the surface of funny it puts the ""oy"" in ships ahoy. Which is a shame. Because it begins promisingly - if brutally - dark. The East India Co. under the cold calculations of Lord Beckett (Tom Hollander) is clamping down on high-sea drifters and their ilk. As a uniformed functionary reads the various civic rights being ""suspended"" a long line of pirates and their folk are hanged. And assembly line meets chorus line as a boy leads his brethren in a low then building ""yo ho"" dirge. Awaiting the noose the lad pushes the films PG-13 rating and hints at a macabre ""Oliver"" Or better a scene in the key of ""Sweeney Todd."" After this bold start the movie becomes darker still. This doesnt mean more interesting. Those with aging eyes will wish they had a penlight to navigate the dank lair of pirate captain Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fat) where Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and Elizabeth Swann (Knightley) journey in hopes of securing a map to find Captain Jack Sparrow. Nine pirate captains are needed to battle Beckett and the cursed Davy Jones (Bill Nighy). Verbinski never recovers the bite of his opening tease. Instead the movie becomes an unkempt Busby Berkeley affair full of action numbers that never quite earn their doubloons in storytelling pleasure. Tensions set in motion in ""Dead Mans Chest"" remain Bent on freeing father Bootstrap Bill from the timbers of the haunted Flying Dutchman Will Turner (Bloom) seems willing to betray Elizabeth. Nighy is still a sight to behold beneath that amazingly constructed octo-puss of Davy Jones. Witchy Woman Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris) offers more patois forebodings. Much was made of Keith Richards casting as Jack Sparrows dad. Like so much here though the promise of that idea turns out to be more thrilling than the deckhand execution of it. The movie is loaded with intriguing characters. But not since the singular original have even the marquee players gotten their due. A reminder of what should have been comes late. Aboard the Black Pearl Elizabeth and Will seem to finally find each again. Their timing is as beautifully absurd as Bogie and Hepburns was on the deck of the German ship in ""The African Queen."" This moment of Hollywood romance amid the swirl of combative chaos is the movies second-best choreographed scene. Only theres no little emotional melody here. Composer Hans Zimmer overdoes his part swamping the action with instrumental swells sure to erode beachfronts everywhere. At the end of ""Dead Mans Chest"" Johnny Depps utterly unique unsinkable pirate was cast into Davy Jones Locker. This vault turns out to be an otherworldly locale of sun-bleached sand and morphing rocks. Here Sparrow is surrounded by a flock of chirping versions of himself. Its as if the writers were punishing anyone who thought ""Dead Mans Chest"" short on the mascara-wearing mincing Jack. Its trippy. Think Fear and Loathing in the Caribbean. But its not quite magical. In the movies parting shots the filmmakers appear to acknowledge the truth drowned out by flash and opening weekend flurry. As booty-garnering as the second voyage was and this third is likely to be it was the first ""Pirates"" (so spare in retrospect) that was a treasure. Theyve plundered its characters. In doing so theyve committed their own version of piracy. Film critic Lisa Kennedy can be reached at 303-954-1567 or lkennedydenverpost.com.

Comments Pirates of the Caribbean At Worlds End Nearly every element of the previous two movies resurfaces in this third adventure which ends up overloaded with characters and subplots. Returning villains Geoffrey Rush Bill Nighy and Tom Hollander team with Chow Yun-fat and a half-dozen pirate lords to bedevil fey buccaneer Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and star-crossed lovers Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley. Depp plays multiple versions of Sparrow who now suffers from a split personality; his shtick is funny but the players are all upstaged by the astonishing special effects superior to those of earlier installments in creating a wondrous and menacing world. Gore Verbinski directed; with Naomie Harris Stellan Skarsgard and Keith Richards. PG-13 170 min.

BY Jack Mathewsdaily News Movie Critic Wednesday May 23 2007 1015 PM ""Pirates of the Carribean At Worlds End"" Third film in the swashbuckling pirate series spun out of the Disneyland theme park attraction. With Johnny Depp Keira Knightley Orlando Bloom Bill Nighy.  Director Gore Verbinski (245). PG-13 Violence. Opens tomorrow at 8 p.m. Like the first two films in Gore Verbinskis ""Pirates of theCaribbean"" series ""At Worlds End"" is a sumptuous feast for the eyes and an occasionally exhilarating stimulant to the heart. But beware my hearty It will tie your rum-soaked brain in knots. ""Do you think he plans it all out"" says one character of Johnny Depps endearing Jack Sparrow ""or does he just make it up as he goes along?"" You might ask that question of the series main writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio. There are so many twists switchbacks betrayals double crosses subplots hallucinatory fantasies and bits of magic stuffed into this 2-hour-and-45-minute finale to make you pine for a simple ride through the Disneyland attraction that inspired it all. One cant quarrel with the writers fevered imaginations. But when an action movie has to continually stop to have characters explain whats going on it becomes an inaction movie. The good - really good - news is that when the film finally cuts loose with a climactic high seas battle pitting the East India Companys evil Lord Beckett (Tom Hollander) and the ghostly crew of Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) against a league of pirates led by their newly elected ""king"" Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) the eyes and hearts of the audience are indeed well-fed. Had Verbinski cut an hour from the front end of the movie - the minutes devoted to a romantic backstory between Davy Jones and the black-toothed mystic Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris) would have been a good place to start - wed be on our feet cheering it on. As it is we have two hours of talk and whimsy essentially acknowledging Depps creation of Jack Sparrow while hes creating him - even an appearance by Depps inspiration the Rolling Stones Keith Richards to more or less take a bow for his contribution. Still after the films final act at Shipwreck Cove one does feel a sense of satisfaction with the ""Pirates"" series the glow of a rum punch and an ocean sunset. jmathewsnydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"Pirates of the Caribbean At Worlds End | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; pirates-of-the-caribbean-at-world-s-end ) Pirates of the Caribbean At Worlds End (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli When it comes to the final hour Pirates of the Caribbean At Worlds End delivers the goods. The last 60 minutes offer adventure as rousing as anything provided in either of the previous installments Pirates of the Caribbean Curse of the Black Pearl and Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Mans Chest. Unfortunately that doesnt account for the other 108 minutes of this gorged self-indulgent and uneven production. During the course of nearly two hours of exposition and setup theres little in the way of charm or action. There are memorable moments to be sure but the overwhelming sense is that the film is desperately spinning its wheels trying to shock and awe with unexpected plot developments. As an end to a trilogy At Worlds End does its job although with less flair and economy than one might hope. It resolves myriad subplots and gets the surviving characters to places where their stories can end or go on as future sequels demand. Like the other two entries in the series its too long and needlessly convoluted. The movie is also more ponderous than the previous Pirates. The defining quality of Curse of the Black Pearl and Dead Mans Chest was a sense of breezy fun. This movie lacks the same feel. Perhaps itas the weight of expectations and the need to top what went before. The thrilling final hour is almost enough to make one forget how much of a labor it is to trudge through the first two-thirds - almost but not quite. The movies first act concentrates on the rescue of Capn Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) from Davy Jones Locker where he ended up after dueling the Kraken at the end of the second installment. Jack and his ship The Black Pearl are stuck in limbo wheres hes seeing multiples of himself and being followed by a crab that looks like a rock. Meanwhile his former companions - including Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) Elizabeth Swann (Kiera Knightley) and the newly resurrected Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) - go to the Orient to enlist the help of Pirate Captain Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fat). Their goal travel to the land beyond death and retrieve Jack. Then with him in tow they can attend a gathering of the Nine Lords of the Brethren to determine the future of piracy in the Caribbean. With Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) in his thrall Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) and his lacky Admiral James Norrington (Jack Davenport) have control of the seas. No normal ship can stand against The Flying Dutchman. At Worlds End doesnt blend the humor and the derring-do as well as its predecessors. For the most part the jokes are lazier and Capn Jack has lost some of his zing. Maybe it has something to do with his being killed at the end of the last movie. Geoffrey Rushs Barbossa is more restrained; the intimidation factor is gone. Maybe it has something to do with his being resurrected at the end of the last movie. The on-again/off-again love affair between Will and Elizabeth is on again (following her brief dalliance with Jack) and while sparks dont fly at least both characters evidence more pizzazz this time round. Meanwhile Capn Jack finds his screen time leeched away to others. A late entrance and too may extraneous side-stories take the focus off our swishy hero and thats not a good thing. Three films into what could be a very long run (as long as the box office holds up and the actor remains interested) Depp has found his alter-egos skin to be a comfortable fit. Hes a little less flip this time around but he still has a good one-liner or two reserved for special occasions. Kiera Knightley continues the ascendancy she began in Dead Mans Chest evolving from damsel in distress to full-fledged pirate and swordswoman. Is there anything sexier than a woman with a naked blade? Sadly her sparkling chemistry with Depp is absent this time around - the two say no more than a handful of words to each other. Orlando Bloom has grown into his role. Finally Will Turner has becomes something a little more interesting than a one-dimensional hero type. Theres a little Han Solo in this Luke Skywalker. As far as the bad guys are concerned theyre not an intimidating bunch. Without his Kraken Davy Jones is just another fishy looking CGI creature. As Cutler Beckett Tom Hollander does a good job being nasty but one never gets the impression that hell be able to get the better of Jack. Defining other villains could be misleading since numerous characters changes sides some more than once. At times a scorecard is needed to figure whos on which team at any given time. Most of the films special effects budget was consumed in the final 45 minutes during which At Worlds End throws everything one could ask for from a pirate movie at the audience. There are swordfights in the rigging sea storms ship-to-ship battles between entire fleets monkeys loaded into canons a woman dissolving into crabs and all manner of other excesses to shiver ones timbers. And for those who are patient and willing to sit through the entire seven minutes of end credits theres a nice reward at the end. I wont reveal anything about the ""bonus"" scene except to say that its more significant than the one following the credits for Dead Mans Chest. The need to make longer more busy second sequels is an undesirable trend. By throwing so much into the mix the filmmakers - including director Gore Verbinski who has helmed all three pirate yarns - risk losing what attracted viewers in the first place. The initial Pirates was an unexpected hit. The need to do things bigger and more spectacular led to fissures in Dead Mans Chest. Those fissures have widened and deepened in At Worlds End. Most Pirates aficionados wont complain (at least not too much). This is a chance to re-visit old friends and see where some of their stories end. Its a chance to sail with Capn Jack from death to life and meet his dad (played as has been reported everywhere by Keith Richards). The movie does enough things right that it wont leave scores of despondent fans in its wake. Unfortunately it does enough things wrong to keep me from giving it a wholehearted recommendation. It could have been better but it also could have been worse. We can be thankful its not the latter while mourning its not the first.

From that one coded signal Jack realizes that he must plunge the ship hes sailing into the sea and come out the other side. Thats a nifty trick. And in general Up Is Down seems a good motto for a Pirates sequel which needs every last bit of topsy-turvy spirit. That spirit is there early on in a kiddie head-trip sequence where Jack still stuck in his undead limbo hallucinates multiple versions of himself which he happily kills off. He then thinks that hes seeing -- or maybe is seeing -- rocks that turn into crabs which carry his ship across the desert. (Hey I dont write this stuff I just review it.) A bit later the movie features an elaborately well-staged Mexican standoff which ends with a monkey holding a gun. And there is also a meeting of the worlds pirate lords (theyve gathered to fight back against the British) which suggests a Hells Angels convention with yellower teeth. When Keith Richards as Jacks matey of a father finally shows up for roughly two minutes brandishing a face thats like melted Silly Putty he makes Davy Jones with his squishy tentacled mug look like a Neutrogena spokesmodel. Yet along with all of this sprightly nonsense there is far too much lugubrious nonsense. At Worlds End is so frantic and dissociated that it barely pretends to make sense. The Pirates films with their merry storm-tossed slapstick their retro serial corniness are a bit like the Indiana Jones films only broader sloppier and longer. They make you feel like youre at a Disney theme restaurant with too many enthusiastic waiters. That quality fun yet exhausting is exacerbated by the tendency of third-part sequels to feature more conflicts and problems than the previous two installments combined. It must be that the director Gore Verbinski and the screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio are overcompensating. Just about every character in At Worlds End comes with his or her own agenda and the movie grows top-heavy as we attempt to keep track of whos trying to accomplish what. Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) is out to free his barnacled father (Stellan Skarsgard); Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) wants to avenge the death of her father (Jonathan Pryce); Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris) with her mondo-zombie accent (""Dares an eevil undah da sea..."") wants to free the ocean goddess inside her; the heartless squid-face Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) wants for a moment at least to rediscover his soft side; the happy raider Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) wants to reassert the freewheeling age of pirates; and good old Jack just wants to booze and sail. After At Worlds End youll know how he feels. The movie is two hours and 47 minutes of debts curses shape-shifts and betrayals most of which leave us baffled because they dont pay off. The worst news to me (and maybe Im in the minority) is that the film returns to the heavy-spirited whimsy of The Curse of the Black Pearl. The follow-up Dead Mans Chest was an anomaly of a sequel in that the entire film took its tone from Johnny Depps arch sozzled deviltry. It was a true tall tale with cheeky duels out of a 30s Paramount comedy that terrific sea monster and that demented chase on the giant wheel (which was like Buster Keaton restaged by Spielberg). It had a tossed-in-the-air fruitcake quality that worked for audiences like an escape from the escapism of summer movies. At Worlds End lacks that fizzy charm. Its dutiful rather than buoyant. Depp still clowns like a pickled vamp using his here-slurry there-speeded-up delivery to suggest that Jack is a lot smarter than he lets on (or even realizes himself). Yet he holds no more surprise for us. If theres an actor who provides At Worlds End with a shot of humanity its Bill Nighy. He uses his fiery theatrical rhythms to give Davy Jones a wonderful seething fervor and I wish the film had played up his poison-love backstory. Instead were stuck with a late-in-the-game revival of the Orlando Bloom-Keira Knightley ""chemistry"" and its an embarrassment an admission that this old-fashioned yarn needs romance yet in effect has none. Knightleys Elizabeth becomes a pirate captain this time. You know a franchise has run its course when it has a buccaneer heroine who looks as if shed hate to get her face smudged.

""Pirates of the Caribbean At Worlds End"" clocks in at more than 23/4 hours but unlike last years bloated sequel at least possesses some semblance of a destination making it slightly more coherent -- if no less numbing during the protracted finale. The third voyage in the ""Pirates"" trilogy could be touted as ""the biggest loudest and second-best (or second-worst) Pirates ever"" -- not necessarily a ringing endorsement but honest. ""Pirates of the Caribbean At Worlds End"" clocks in at more than 23/4 hours but unlike last years bloated sequel at least possesses some semblance of a destination making it slightly more coherent -- if no less numbing during the protracted finale. A bountiful opening is assured. The running time could diminish this swashbucklers staying power but Disney would likely leap at ""Pirates IV"" in a heartbeat if the principals would enlist for another tour at sea. In a sense the two ""Pirates"" sequels feel less like movies than a shared event -- much like a concert where the audience sits patiently through lesser known numbers to hear the band belt out favorite tunes. A similar phenomenon occurs during the arid stretches (and there are several) in this sprawling messy adventure to be endured until Johnny Depp does something flamboyantly amusing or a new face like Keith Richards or Chow Yun-fat graces the screen. The notion of ""Pirates"" as foremost a consumer product came through loud and clear in the current Entertainment Weekly in which director Gore Verbinski referred to the screwy process of shooting the second and much of the third movie simultaneously as ""How Not to Make a Film 101."" At one point when a character asks of Depps loopy Capt. Jack Sparrow ""Do you think he plans it out or just makes it up as he goes along?"" its hard not to wonder if Verbinski and his writing collaborators Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio arent slipping in a sly comment about the film itself. Whatever quaint underpinnings there were to the class-divided romance between Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) have dissipated in the journey since the 2003 original as their relationship goes through a series of fits starts and betrayals -- all in this movie alone. Picking up where the second left off (though a refresher course wouldnt hurt) the couple and Capt. Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) begin in Singapore where they and their pirate mates hope to liberate Jack from Davy Jones Locker a surreal realm between purgatory and hell. A lengthy battle ensues before the too-long quest to find Jack leads to a colorful international assembly of pirates at Shipwreck City with the East India Trading Co.s hissable nobleman Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) in hot pursuit and a final showdown inevitable. That questions of life and death are somewhat fungible here helps mitigate the high level of carnage which includes a mass hanging sequence at the outset as Beckett wages a reign of terror in seeking to bring the pirates to heel. Becketts arsenal also features the Flying Dutchman the seemingly indestructible ghost ship captained by Davy Jones (Bill Nighy seen fleetingly outside of his way-cool octopus visage). But can Will Elizabeth and Jack defeat Jones and Beckett -- and unfetter Wills dad (Stellan Skarsgard) a barnacle-encrusted soul under Jones spell -- without sacrificing someone on their side given that slaying Jones requires that somebody take his place aboard the doomed vessel? For the most part those big themes and even the fundamental rules are easily obscured by the cacophony of relentless state-of-the-art special effects and Hans Zimmers equally unremitting score which at times overwhelms the dialogue. Indeed repetitive action from multiple cannon-firing battles to ship-sucking vortexes yield diminishing returns; the pics greatest virtue is its sense of whimsy whether that involves multiple Depps debating himself or the crews slapstick antics which wring considerable mileage out of that monkey and parrot. Depps fey morally challenged buccaneer remains a kick and the pics biggest asset whereas the now-butt-kicking Elizabeth and conflicted Will -- however dreamy -- have grown tiresome especially when saddled with stirring Errol Flynn-style ""Avast me hearties"" interludes. In musing about the Land of the Dead Barbossa suggests that getting there isnt the tough part; ""Its getting back."" Given that producer Jerry Bruckheimers crew unlocked the secret to spinning riches out of a theme-park attraction in this case getting there was no small feat. Its returning there that has been something of a chore -- a course ""At Worlds End"" steadies but cant entirely reverse.
