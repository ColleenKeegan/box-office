Dick would totally dig it. Every sci-fi and action flick cliche is crammed into this script and director Jonathan Mostow couldnt give a damn if youve seen them all before. He might not do them better but hell do them well enough. Willis stars as a cop or really a robot recreation of himself as a cop who does the dirty dangerous work while the actual wastes away in his bedroom. Willis idealized self his ""surrogate"" is him only better. Not only can he survive a deadly crash leap over trailers in a single bound and chase bad guys without even fretting over a missing arm hes younger and smoother too. (This isnt a satire but you know everyone on set knew that robot Willis foppish blonde wig was hilarious.) His wife (Rosamund Pike) partner (Radha Mitchell) boss (Boris Kodjoe) and neighbors all use surrogates too. (The cast is airbrushed to eerie perfection--the producers must have been thrilled to hire the most physically flawless extras.) In fact the only people who dont use surrogates are ""meat bags"" wrinkled sloppy bumpkin-hippies led by The Prophet (Ving Rhames) who pledges to unplug societys upper echelons. Someone turns out to already be on the job--the creator of an Overload Device that sends such an electric shock through the surrogates that it liquefies their operators brains. Can Willis rescue humanity? Do you really need to ask? Just grab the biggest popcorn the multiplex has and follow the relentlessly entertaining flicks lead by checking your free will at the lobby door. 0 Comments Be the first to comment You must be logged in to post a comment.

"Surrogates | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; surrogates ) Surrogates (United States 2009) September 25 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli Surrogates was not pre-screened for critics. Most of the time I understand when a studio takes this route - its a way to avoid undue negative publicity before the release of a movie that is recognized behind-the-scenes as being a turd. Once in a while however a non-screened movie turns out to be a pleasant surprise and this is one of those instances. Surrogates is better and more thought-provoking than about 2/3 of the fare currently showing in multiplexes yet it has been given a ""no confidence"" vote by Disney. Why? Who knows? Maybe the decision was made to cut this loose and spend as little on marketing as was viable without offending star Bruce Willis. Perhaps an assessment was made that there werent enough action scenes (although there are plenty) to energize the target teen audience. Or most disturbingly maybe it was thought that the premise was too cerebral for the throngs of movie-goers who clog multiplex corridors on Friday and Saturday nights. Whatever the reason Surrogates was shielded from the eyes of critics before its opening and thats a shame. Because whatever its flaws it is a good movie. The material is not new to science fiction fans. In fact it has been a staple of the genre since there has been a genre. It appears in the writings of many of the greats. It was a lynchpin of the original Star Trek pilot (""The Cage"" with Jeffrey Hunter). And it has been an element in numerous recent big-screen sci-fi productions (The Matrix and Dark City to name two - and there are others). Surrogates is not the best of the stories to delve into this subject but its far from the worst. It is hamstrung by the need to prioritize pacing over content. The movie runs a little too short and skimps on aspects of plot development in order to keep things moving at a fast pace. Today on-line many people you ""meet"" in chatrooms are not who they seem to be. 40-year old men may be posing as 20-something women. Teenage boys may be adding a dozen years to their age. And pedophile catchers associated with Chris Hansen may be pretending to be underage girls. In the cyber-realm its possible to be whoever or whatever you want to be. In the world of Surrogates this has been taken one step further. Technology has enabled people to have real three-dimensional robot avatars taking their place in society while they lie in a bed and control the mechanical beings actions with their minds. Virtually all interaction is done through the surrogates and although this reduces the dangers of day-to-day life and has all-but eliminated violent crime it has also increased isolation. People no longer feel comfortable dealing with other people even spouses without the surrogate buffer. There are groups of humans that reject the surrogate culture but they have been marginalized and are forced to live in ghettoized reservations. Greer (Bruce Willis) and Peters (Radha Mitchell) are FBI agents investigating a double homicide in which the destruction of two surrogates appears to have killed their users. This is not supposed to happen and violates a failsafe. In order to get more information they approach the creator of surrogates Canter (James Cromwell) who also happens to be the father of one of the victims. Canter realizes that the target of the murder attempt may have been him and points the finger of blame at the corporation he created (but no longer runs). When Greers surrogate is destroyed and the FBI refuses to provide him with another one until an investigation runs its course he elects to go out ""in the flesh"" and the details uncovered by his sleuthing cause him to reach a terrifying conclusion. The films direction by Jonathan Mostow is crisp and clean. He shows the same flair for action he displayed in Terminator 3 and his sequences are coherent and not marred by the quick cutting and flashy camera moves that have hijacked too many action scenes in recent productions. Although the movie likely would have been better had the story been fleshed out more it does not give the appearance of having been noticeably ""dumbed down."" Although this is first and foremost an action/adventure movie it does not neglect the hard questions about technology. There is also a delicious bit of irony near the end; we consider along with Greer the benefits and penalties associated with action versus inaction. The special effects work used to create the surrogates is effective. They look almost human. Im reasonably sure this ""unreal"" look was accomplished as much through computer-enhanced airbrushing as it was through makeup. Bruce Willis for example looks 20 years younger (especially compared to the grizzled version who makes his appearance once the surrogate is destroyed). Radha Mitchell is stunning - shes a beautiful woman to begin with but her avatar is flawless. Of course theres a creepiness to all these robots since none of them look or act quite human. Disneys treatment of Surrogates raises the question of whether Bruce Willis once one of the Big Three (alongside Stallone and Schwarzenegger) can still open an action movie. Perhaps the issue isnt Willis drawing power but the fact that hes not playing a gung-ho icon. This isnt John McClane. Greer is physically weak borderline agoraphobic and of dubious hero potential. That kind of protagonist is harder to sell than someone who charges in where angels fear to tread. This should not however be a reason to avoid Surrogates. If anything its a reason to see it. This represesents the smartest high-budget high-profile science fiction film to have come along in quite some time.

Such as Why was this mess made?By David Hiltbrand Inquirer Staff WriterPosted September 26 2009Imagine a future in which you can sit in the comfort of your reclining chair virtually experiencing the world through an idealized pleasure-bot version of yourself.If only the makers of Surrogates had. Instead theyve crafted a superficial sci-fi film loaded with inconsistencies and cranium-scratchers.For instance if the whole point of this surrogate society is to appear as a perfectly beautiful avatar why would Bruce Willis choose that ludicrous blond wig that looks like he plucked it off a mannequin at Boscovs?He plays an FBI agent assigned to investigate some murders heinous forms of activity thought to have been eradicated.Which brings us to another puzzler If crime is nonexistent why does Boston have such a large trigger-happy police force? Presumably its only duty would be traffic control.For that matter if a glamorous free-swinging life is yours for the asking who would choose to be a cop?Surrogates which borrows tone and content freely from I Robot is all windup and no pitch.The premise has promise Young nubile synthetic bodies cruise the streets controlled by pasty atrophied and usually unshaven old slobs sitting at home in their bathrobes. Think of a gallery of Dorian Grays. Or bloggers.Meanwhile pockets of dissenters live on reservations. These Luddites led by a dreadlocked cult figure (Ving Rhames) refuse to participate in the virtual utopia. The surrogate majority refer to them as meat bags.Having established this scenario Surrogates doesnt know what do with itself. So it sends Willis off to uncover a conspiracy that filmgoers probably will not understand and wouldnt care about if they did.For no good reason Willis undertakes this loud lengthy wild goose chase in his own skin like a turtle without its shell. His diminished capacity and grizzled appearance are sources of some concern to his wife (Rosamund Pike) and his FBI partner (Radha Mitchell).Willis gets the big bucks for that trademark squinty grimace amply displayed here. He is forced to emote precisely twice about par for his film work.Surrogates will be quickly banished to the island of broken films but allow us one more question before it disappears If this is a future of technological wonders why do all the cars look like they came from a used-car lot in 2005?Contact staff writer David Hiltbrand at 215-854-4552 or dhiltbrandphillynews.com.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + With breathless lines of dialogue like ""Their brains were liquefied in their skulls - referring to onscreen characters not the audience - its awfully tempting to let ""Surrogates review itself. In fact the latest Bruce Willis futuristic action rama-lama is a reasonably watchable sci-fi B movie a case of a good director and some intriguing ideas struggling to overcome formula plotting limp dialogue and a serious case of the sillies. Give credit to filmmaker Jonathan Mostow for keeping the movie on track; give credit to star Bruce Willis for keeping a straight face.Willis plays Tom Greer a FBI agent of the near future when 98 percent of the population stays at home while their robotic Surrogates - replicants that look like younger prettier versions of their owners - go to work and play feeding the sensations back to the atrophying humans hooked to their stim-chairs. Its sort of like ""The Matrix turned inside out and were our own worst enemy.The boilerplate plot involves a chase after a dastardly superweapon - it looks like a flashlight - that fries Surrogates in public while killing their humans at home. Greer and his partner (Radha Mitchell) follow the trail of carnage all the way to a tribe of anti-Surrogate Luddites (led by Ving Rhames in dreadlocks) a corporate conspiracy and other nefarious doings leading to a race against time to push a computer key that will save the human race.Against such nonsense Mostow comes up with some impressive visual ways to convey the radical social disconnect caused by the Surrogates. Their faces have been given a CGI makeover for one thing so that they all look like extras from ""The Polar Express. A subway car full of Surrogates heading home from work is an eerie sight that may hit home with anyone whos had a bad day; a glimpse of hundreds of soldiers fighting an overseas war from their stim-chairs is a frightening notion the movie doesnt pursue.Actually there are ideas abandoned by the wayside throughout the movie sacrificed to plot illogic and a too-short running time. Is the films message that were already too jacked into our computers and Blackberrys? If so its left on the cutting room floor. At least we finally get Willis with and without hair in the same movie - the unconvincingly toupeed one is the Surrogate; the balding beaten-up one is ""real. The actor God love him gives both roles his all - the mark of a B-movie trouper.Among its other eccentricities ""Surrogates offers a day-after-tomorrow picture of Boston that doesnt jibe with the city as most of us know it despite creative location filming all over the greater metropolitan area. Its one thing to put the heros apartment in the South Ends Cathedral Housing projects; its another to reclaim the entire South Boston waterfront as an anti-robot wasteland.

"Surrogates - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-ProtestMOVIE REVIEW SurrogatesThe idea -- an action movie set in a world where humans leave living to Sims-like robots -- is promising but sense gets shoved aside in the pointless rush-rush.September 25 2009|Robert Abele Trying to lure the self-hypnotized gamer nation out into the world to see a dystopian popcorn flick that paints Sims-style living as the end of civilization might seem like a fools errand. And yet here comes ""Surrogates"" a slick sci-fi number that presents a future in which flawless hot-bodied chicly dressed synthetic humans do the everyday living/working/playing their every action neurally controlled by their real-human counterparts a risk-averse population of shut-ins whove gone to seed. An interesting idea but unfortunately the films narrative and emotional engine operate as mechanically as the titular dead-eyed glamazoids.""Surrogates"" stars Bruce Willis as Tom who in the light of day is a nattily dressed expressionless robot cop (with hair) partnered with a model-licious fellow ""surrie"" (Radha Mitchell) but whose homebound version is a stubbly heartbroken man unable to connect to his surrogate-addicted wife (Rosamund Pike) or get over the death of their son some years earlier. Human Tom must face the world though when his surrogate is destroyed chasing down a man responsible for a criminal rarity actual human murders.It all points to a conspiracy entangling the ubiquitous corporation behind surrogacy the wheelchair-bound inventor of the technology (James Cromwell) and an anti-robot save-humanity protest movement led by a dreadlocked figure named the Prophet (a hammy Ving Rhames). At the heart of it all is a mysterious weapon that when fired at a surrogate acts as the nastiest kind of computer virus destroying its supposedly untouchable flesh-and-blood user too.While the notion holds promise the execution is strictly campy and adrenaline-driven. Director Jonathan Mostow (""Breakdown"" ""Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines"") is a little too enamored with all the shiny colorful surfaces and propulsive action (successfully captured by cinematographer Oliver Wood) to ever develop a truly creepy speculative-future vibe from the programmatic screenplay by John Brancato and Michael Ferris (based on a little-known graphic novel). The question of what surrogate-reliant warfare would mean or who might make up a marginalized no-tech protest community are rarely explored beyond plot usefulness. Blink and youll miss for example the trenchant visual that artificial soldiers replaced quickly on the battlefield and operated from high-tech game rooms are kept faceless and featureless.Also left unexplored are the emotional possibilities of a recluse forced to interact with a teeming society of fembots and himbots. Willis usually a better actor than his recent material gets one mini-scene emoting man-among-mannequins street panic when Tom first ventures outside after years as a hermit. But then its a guns-and-chases race to the ticking-bomb end.--calendarlatimes.com--SurrogatesMPAA rating PG-13 for intense sequences of violence disturbing images language sexuality and a drug-related sceneRunning time 1 hour 28 minutesPlaying In wide release MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESMichael Jacksons This Is ItJanuary 24 2010From Our BlogsOctober 4 2009Movie magic shaves years off sci-fi starOctober 1 2009Can Bruce Willis regain star power with Surrogates?September 24 2009Into each season a few films must fallSeptember 13 2009MORE STORIES ABOUTProtestBruce WillisCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-surrogates25-2009sep25,0,2505507.story",200,surrogates7,surrogates,latimes

Liam Lacey From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Thursday Sep. 24 2009 337PM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 318PM EDT Comments AA Surrogates Directed by Jonathan Mostow Written by John Brancato and Michael Ferris Starring Bruce Willis and Radha Mitchell Classification PG Imagine a world in which regular people lie around at home in their bathrobes and underwear wired to electronic devices which allow them to watch their attractive stylish robot surrogates living vicarious lives for them. No were not talking about the pleasures of prime-time television but a scary science-fiction movie Surrogates  based on a comic book series by Robert Venditti and Brett Weldele. In the world depicted in the movie almost 90 per cent of people use robots to do their jobs and conduct their social lives creating an outside world that is almost free of crime or racism or bad hair. Meanwhile indoors slug-like humans lie on beds desperately in need of gym time and personal stylists. They are referred to as ""biologicals"" by the army or ""meat bags"" by self-hating humans talking through their surrogates. A couple of FBI agents - played by Bruce Willis and Radha Mitchell - are assigned to investigate the murder of some surrogates which (in a departure from the logic of the comic books) somehow also leads to the death of their human masters. Willis as Agent Greer in his surrogate mode wears a tailored suit a Bruno -style blonde wig and a thick layer of orange face powder. In his human form hes bald and has a goatee and looks sad and anguished. Thats because hes married to a gorgeous surrogate cosmetician Maggie (Rosamund Pike) whose real self is a pill-popping depressive in mourning for their dead son. Greer wishes his wife could just be her tired blotchy self again but she prefers to be youthful pretty and plastic. Sharing Greers doubts about surrogacy are a band of rebel humans led by a man named The Prophet (Ving Rhames in Rasta dreads). The rebels have established robot-free shanty-towns where no surrogate wants to go alone at night. Director Jonathan Mostow has been in this man-versus-machine territory before with the half-decent Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines . But the science fiction aspect here is bait-and-switch - a provocative idea - followed by a formula action movie with shootouts helicopter chases and a digital counter before the solution. Theres no convincing explanation why people would commit fewer crimes if they had surrogates or any clear idea about the reciprocal sensations between human and surrogate. Humans are supposed to have only one legal surrogate each but not everyone plays by the rules. All human-to-surrogate signals are run through one central switchboard monitored by a Jabba the Hutt-like FBI agent (Devin Ratray). The only moderately piquant stroke here is the use of Boston - one of United States oldest cities - as the hub of this new world where everyone walking along the historic streets seems to have employed the services of a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon. The questions the movie raises have less to do with science than movie execution Do the actors sound so robotic because they are playing robots well or humans badly? And did a machine write this dialogue? If so could we please apply for an upgrade?

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet In the exposition-packed opening of Surrogates we quickly learn a lot about the near future a familiar-looking place thats been transformed by the invention of robot surrogates. While almost everyone on Earth stays safe at home their surrogates (or ""surries"") go to work ride subway cars with built-in charge ports fuck with abandon then go home to human controllers who have spent the day immobile. In short the entire world apart from a band of holdouts led by Ving Rhames has become addicted to a version of World Of Warcraft brought to the real world. All thrills have become virtual in exchange for safety sloth and the chance to inhabit bodies made perfect by technology. In the process incidents of crime and racism have receded almost to nothing. (And sales of Red Bull and Sun Chips have presumably spiked.) Adapted from a comic series by writer Robert Venditti and artist Brett Weldele Surrogates creates a world it has little interest in exploring beyond the boundaries set by a fairly dull whodunit. Bruce Willis stars as a Boston detective called in to investigate the first homicide in recent memory when a flesh-and-blood biker uses a weapon capable of killing flesh-and-blood users through their surrogates. No stranger to surrogate use himself he investigates the crime looking like a plastic-skinned floppy-haired version of the Willis who starred in Moonlighting while his bald goateed true self sits at home looking like late-period Billy Joel. But hes already distrustful of excessive surry use thanks to a wife (Rosamund Pike) who treats her flesh-and-blood self as an annoyance and the deeper he plunges into the machinations behind his clean safe world the more secrets he discovers. Director Jonathan Mostow (Terminator 3) keeps hustling the film past its more intriguing moments--as when Pike looks repulsed at Willis insistence that he use his real body--in the service of a plot that doesnt stir much interest. But then neither does the movie which relentlessly plods from one dour moment to the next coming to life only in a late-film car chase that takes the possibilities of a world filled with robots to an absurd extreme. Then were back to Willis playing another cop uncovering another mystery in another high production values/low-impact thriller a too-familiar sight in worlds past present or future.

You stay at home linked to a terminal they go out and do your job. Whats more you can plug into the buffed-up synthetic sexy bad self you always wanted to be. No wonder the advertisements claim its Life...only better. As Bruce Williss dogged police detective discovers in this dystopian procedural however there just has to be a downside. His failing marriage is one thing since he now only speaks to his estranged wifes perenially perky surrogate (Rosamund Pike) but when he connects the killing of a party-going surry with the death of its human master the supposedly safe life of vicarious pleasure just got more dangerous for millions of plugged-in people. With their too-perfect skin and dead eyes the surries are the stars here chilling yet plausible incarnations of a desire to turn our entire lives into one big role-playing scenario. Theres a chuckle at our first glimpse of Williss hirsute robotic self but the course of the story also highlights a residual longing for the everyday human connections this brave new world looks set to expunge. Essentially Jonathan Mostows film is a terrific pop sci-fi conceit in search of a plot and while the detective story uncovering a sinister conspiracy is a functional enough hook for sundry revelations and car chases its also somewhat foursquare and predictable. The milieu though is fascinating the performances are adept at differentiating the human from the surry and the jargon is inventive (the robots call us meatbags). The ideas probably have a bit more juice than the movie but its still an alert piece of entertainment.

AMONG cheesy sci-fi movies meant to make you think Ill take ""Surrogates"" over ""District 9."" Both are highly derivative but in the course of recombining the basic chromosomes of ""Blade Runner"" ""The Matrix"" and especially ""I Robot"" ""Surrogates"" nudges the robo-thriller in an interesting direction. Bruce Willis plays a detective with an appalling wig (floppy and blond) and doll-smooth skin. But dont worry. Youll be seeing him bald and modeling a face like the bottom of a rock climbers boot soon enough. The principal fun of the movie is not the fairly routine suspense and action sequences which depend heavily on a couple of car chases and such wheezing devices as a computer monitor charting the progress of a download that could change everything. The fun is in the world it creates -- so read no further if youd rather not have a clever situation spoiled. The Willis characters are both a tired old couch potato who sits home all day with gizmos hooked up to his brain and his avatar or ""surrogate"" -- a remote-controlled puppet all but indistinguishable from a living human being that does his bidding. The visible world is pretty much solely populated by these ""surreys"" -- fitter younger more beautiful versions of the dumpy unshaven dirtbags who control them without ever leaving the house. A more derisive term for the puppets ""Yodas."" Not convinced that large numbers of people want to live vicariously? Two words ""The Sims."" The conceit is an amazingly flexible satiric instrument that simultaneously spoofs video and online gamers Hollywood (the streets of Boston are filled with impossibly good-looking people -- yet they all have a creepy waxworks quality) drug addiction and sloth. Why put on makeup work out or even change out of your bathrobe? Your surrey always looks good. The amount of difficulty I had imagining an America that has reached this stage of techno-gorged passivity wasnt large. As the Willis character tries to solve a murder in which an attack on a surrogate was used to fry the brain of the real person controlling it director Jonathan Mostow and writers Michael Ferris and John D. Bracanto keep the pedal down with lots of possible motives and suspects. They include cops the military and a rasta radical (Ving Rhames looking good in dreadlocks) who represents the ""dreaders"" -- feisty holdout humans who refuse to filter experience through surrogates and have been shunted off into robot-free reservations. Several scenes look like outtakes from ""I Robot"" and James Cromwell pops up playing the same role he played in that movie which had far more impressive special effects. But it and ""Blade Runner"" with their endless ruminating about whether robots have feelings miss an important point brought up by ""Surrogates."" A potent insight of this film is that surrogates would really catch on among parents who would of course get robots to stand in for their kids to keep them safe. Kids would grow up thinking that never leaving the couch is perfectly natural. Arent our wee ones already becoming Wii ones?

"Surrogates and Pandorum Clones of sci-fi classics | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsOpinionSurrogates and Pandorum Clones of sci-fi classicsIn space no one can hear you scream ""ripoff""Bruce Willis -- or is that his robot clone? -- pulls double duty as an FBI agent in Surrogates the stronger of two derivative sci-fi movies opening today.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Sept. 25 2009 Surrogates (out of 4) Starring Bruce Willis Radha Mitchell Rosamund Pike and Ving Rhames. Directed by Jonathan Mostow. 96 minutes. At major theatres. PG Pandorum (out of 4) Starring Ben Foster Dennis Quaid Antje Traue andCam Gigandet. Directed by Christian Alvart. 108 minutes. At major theatres. 14A In space no one can hear you scream ""ripoff""Not on Earth either. Especially in that alien territory known as Hollywood where originality long ago had a plastic stake driven through its heart.So it is that today brings two highly derivative sci-fi movies Surrogates and Pandorum each laden with more debris than WALL-Es junk pile. Take a deep breath for the ripoff rap sheet which is far from complete. Surrogates starring Bruce Willis as a homicide cop hunting a high-tech killer is an amalgam of The Matrix Blade Runner The Island The Stepford Wives Terminator Westworld and I Robot. Pandorum starring Ben Foster and Dennis Quaid as stranded astronauts on a ship of fanged cannibals steals from Alien Aliens Event Horizon Pitch Black Resident Evil and the video game Dead Space. Together the two movies pretty much cover the known sci-fi universe with the creepier Pandorum leaning towards the sub-genre known as sci-fi horror. But heres the astonishing thing theyre both okay in a copycat sort of way and the stronger Surrogates bleakly satirizes our increasingly plugged-in world. If theres one thing science has taught us this week its that not all clones are created equal.The poster image of a greying and grizzled Willis is a tip that Surrogates isnt just another of the actors paycheque gigs. He pulls double duty here as both human and robot and actually breaks a sweat and comes close to tears.His human form is FBI Agent Greer a man largely made redundant by technology. The year is 2017 and humans have voluntarily replaced themselves with mechanical clones that not only do all the heavy lifting they also do all the living. People remain in bed tethered to remote controls while their perfectly coiffed and sculptured bots go out into the big bad world. But the world isnt so bad any more because robots arent inclined to crime and violence the way fallible humans are - or are they?Greers ""surry"" has pancake makeup and a cute blond toupee but he still possesses an attitude. On the job hes teamed with Radha Mitchells waxen Agent Peters who never blinks. At home Greer is nominally married to Rosamund Pikes brittle Maggie who averts his gaze. She doesnt possess the warmth even of a Stepford gal. The mundanity of modernity is shattered when a surrogate is ""murdered"" and its human host fatally feels the impact. Thats not supposed to happen and the ex-human happens to be linked to the man who invented surrogates and changed the world. Someone or something apparently wants to reboot the status quo again and Greer is just the man - or machine - to find out why.Willis is fully engaged with the film which is deeper than anything weve come to expect lately from director Jonathan Mostow who drove the last two Terminator movies straight off a computer-rendered cliff. But he also made the superior thrillers Breakdown and U-571 a decade or so ago so perhaps he (or a surrogate?) is returning to form. Pandorums adequacy is perhaps more of a shock since it very nearly fell into that terrifying category of the Friday Dreadful those benighted strips of celluloid abandoned by their studios and deprived of critical previews.The year is 2174 and were advised up front that the Earths battle to control global warming and to conserve scarce resources has been about as effective as a broken fly swatter.Theres nothing to do but attempt the Hail Mary pass of shipping vast loads of humanity spacewards in the hope of finding more hospitable climes elsewhere in the galaxy. It will be a long trip so everybody has to make like an icicle and chill the folk out.But when astronauts Bower (Ben Foster) and Payton (Dennis Quaid) are suddenly thawed from their cryogenic slumber they discover theyre chillingly alone yet not really alone.Students of Sci-fi 101 and anyone who has seen the Pandorum trailer know that this means there are things both good and bad hidden aboard the cavernous space ark and the latter have a tendency to shriek to spurt icky black ooze and to snack on human flesh. The title incidentally refers to a deep-space version of going stir crazy which doesnt help when youre attempting to restart a wonky nuclear reactor (theyre still using nukes in 2174?) and to outrun a band of greasy cannibals.Directed by Germanys Christian Alvart Pandorum both starts and ends well never a sure thing with movies of this ilk. The long middle portion does get tedious obvious and downright laughable but sci-fi fans probably wont regret the experience. And its always gratifying to know that even in the direst of circumstances female space travellers still remember to don bust-revealing skin-tight outfits. The baser human instincts remain even in worlds overrun by robots and cannibals.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

ABOUT THE MOVIESurrogates   (out of four) Stars Bruce Willis Radha Mitchell Rosamund Pike James Cromwell Ving Rhames Boris KodjoeDirector Jonathan MostowDistributor Touchstone PicturesRating PG-13 for intense sequences of violence disturbing images language sexuality and a drug-related sceneRunning time 1 hour 28 minutesOpens Friday nationwide  WATCH THE TRAILER By Mike Clark USA TODAY Half a howler but not nearly funny enough the seriously intended (or at least somberly mounted) Surrogates naturally wants to reap some of the praise and permanent fandom accorded Blade Runner and RoboCop. Instead it more resembles Michael Crichtons Looker (in which sinister surgery further ""perfects"" dishy advertising models) one of the more risible misfires of 1981. BACK STORY Surrogates brings Vendittis graphic novel to big screen Despite bumpy execution likely to have detractors yelling ""deja boo"" Surrogates oozes possibilities. The hook Even if you or I look like Quasimodo or his female equivalent technology will now allow us to attach ourselves to machines and live vicariously through our robotic duplicates. We can even take on physical characteristics of someone else of any age if desired. A mixed-up inventor (James Cromwell) has launched this folly which leads to decreases in crime disease and discrimination. (The script never says whether the innovation has made current Hollywood movies any better.) Thus we get two Bruce Willises here. The real one a cop is the standard weathered Bruce bald again and still wearing what looks like used face stubble. His surrogate though has wavy bottle-colored hair and the porcelain skin of a hairdresser. Female surrogates including Willis partner (Radha Mitchell) also have flawless but fake-looking skin and theres a potentially great scene involving Mrs. Willis (Rosamund Pike). Her job applying ""fresh faces"" at a salon where employees first peel off customers conventionally attractive faces exposing the points and plugs underneath. But the movies tone is rarely satirical and is more concerned with political intrigue involving pockets of anti-surrogate protesters who enjoy bludgeoning the machines. Theyre led by Ving Rhames sporting the hair weave youd expect of someone calling himself ""The Prophet."" Coming so soon after the powerful us-and-them dynamics of District 9 this is minor stuff and the movie amazingly doesnt even address the sexual ramifications (good or bad) of a surrogate society that eschews ""ugly."" But at least it explains the weeks major mystery. Obviously it must have been a Tom DeLay surrogate who was shaking his booty on Dancing With the Stars.

""Surrogates"" Movie Review -- In ""Surrogates"" people live in a world in which robots perform all the public tasks of their lives allowing the lazy humans to stay safely cocooned at home. Unfortunately this service is not yet available for film critics. So Thursday morning at 11 a.m. I went into the city for a ""courtesy screening"" of the new film -- discourteously scheduled to make missing entertainment-section deadlines almost inevitable. (Eds. note Almost.) Luckily its not a film that demands a lengthy analysis. Surrogates (PG-13) Touchstone (104 min.) Directed by Jonathan Mostow. With Bruce Willis Rosamond Pike Radha Mitchell. Now playing in theaters throughout New Jersey. STEPHEN WHITTYYS RATING ONE AND A HALF STARS Rating note The film contains violence strong language and sexual situations. Set a decade-and-a-half in the future the movie imagines a different sort of ""Westworld""; humans now stay home jacked into their computers and their stronger sexier duplicates go out and get in all the danger (and have most of the fun which their owners experience only vicariously). Except now theres some scarred anonymous assassin out there killing the ""surries"" -- and with every blast fatally frying the brains of the plugged-in humans at home. There is a major problem with this gimmick -- and its simply that with all of the human characters dozing at home just about everybody we meet is a robot waxen-faced flaxen-wigged and almost utterly devoid of expression. True this is how Bruce Willis has gone through most of his movies recently. Still its a little hard to care about someone who looks like a Macys mannequin as everyone does here -- albeit with better hair larger chests and an ability to leap onto speeding cars. Its a little hard to understand their motivation too as later in the movie one of the robots is hijacked by another operator. And another. Since the characters motives shift with every user its suddenly not a movie but a boring computer game in which your friend refuses to share the controls. The script is by the team that gave us ""Catwoman"" and the last two ""Terminator"" movies which tells you all you need to know. The direction is by Jonathan Mostow who did a couple of good genre movies early on and then went off the rails with ""Terminator 3."" ""Surrogates"" continues the slide. Despite all the technological advances the movies imagery remains stale relying on the same old ""shocks"" -- human ""faces"" peeled off metal skulls gunshots revealing only twisted wiring -- that weve seen in sci-fi films for years. Whenever things get dull Mostow throws in a car crash. And things get dull a lot. Oh Willis automaton cop does his job striding around and looking for the scarred killer (who himself seems to have wandered in from some 70s sci-fi movie). And then Willis surry-with-the-fringe-on-top gets destroyed -- and Willis has to leave his cozy apartment and actually do some detective work himself. At least theres a chance for some humor there -- particularly in the fact that the ""real"" Willis looks a lot more like an exhausted Billy Joel than a golden cop. But pretty soon hes running around throwing punches and talking tough just like his stoic stand-in. The lovely Rosamund Pike -- whose check here I hope enabled her to do next months fine ""An Education"" -- brings a few real moments to her role as Willis wife. Radha Mitchell remains merely Vulcanized as Willis rubbery robo-partner. But little of it is to any effect and if you cant figure out who the villain is then you must have sent your surrogate to the theater instead. Which actually is a great idea.

"Surrogates Movie review of Surrogates by Roger Moore - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Entertainment Entertainment Movie review Surrogates -- 2 out of 5 stars Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Surrogates is a workmanlike sci-fi action film with few pretenses a movie that hints at much but grapples with little.Set in the VERY near future its about the ways technology disconnects us from reality and humanity about the obsession with physical perfection the death of privacy corporatization and not really a stretch the U.S. techno-war against radical primitivism. Thats a lot to cull from the Robert Venditti/Brett Weldele comic book which was a much more succinct commentary on our cell-phone/Facebook/avatar lives with the idea that this tech fixation is going to kill us.In the Surrogates future everybody whos anybody has bought a better version of themselves -- sleek sexy robots with TV anchor- Barbie hair and Disney Channel skin. These alternates work flirt and play in our place while we lie in our pajamas in a ""stim"" chair watching and sensing everything our younger cooler and perfect selves do. People are free to be as impulsive reckless and feckless as they want. Accidental deaths in civilian life have gone the way of killed-in-action in the surrogate military. Crime has disappeared the world seems a safer cleaner place -- save for those who resist the temptation to walk the Earth as digital improvements on themselves.But somebody is sneaking about shorting out surrogates and the people who own them. That prompts FBI agent Greer ( Bruce Willis leaner hairier and younger than hes been in 30 years) to mutter ""We may have ourselves an actual homicide here."" He and his partner (Radha Mitchell perfect at portraying the physically perfect) chase down clues through the inventor of surrogates ( James Cromwell and younger proxies) all the way to ""The Rez"" Bostons independent enclave of surrogate-hating technology-eschewing survivalists a ""Human Coalition"" led by their prophet ( Ving Rhames well cast).Before you can say ""Of course thats what hell do"" Greer has gone ""off the Rez"" stopped investigating the case through his surrogate and started running around in his bald battered old body and running the risk of actually getting killed on the job.Characters pause from time to time to debate what it means to be human. Actually that was debated in the similar Blade Runner. This 86-minute film doesnt so much debate as hit a few talking points. Derivative tales like this are equal opportunity borrowers -- a little I Robot some Minority Report a hint of A.I. and so on. A running argument between Greer and his wife (Rosamund Pike polished beyond perfection) holds the promise of explaining why someone would withdraw into this digital world and refuse to come out. The promise isnt quite kept. Director Jonathan Mostow ( U-571) keeps things moving which doesnt quite block the questions that rush in. Why would a digital me look at his digital watch? Why would there be ""watcher"" robots to monitor surveillance cameras when thats already a job for a simpler computer? And ""Do androids dream of electric sheep?"" That last one is the title of the Philip K. Dick short story that is the jumping-off point for pretty much every machine-humanity debate in the robot/clone corner of sci-fi beginning with Blade Runner. It makes for a movie that is watchable but obvious -- from the places the big explosions come in the formula to the big ""conspiracy explanation"" speeches among the principals. And for all the inspirations the pieces of better stories that this tale was concocted from Surrogates never manages to be anything more than a poor substitute for the real thing.

A film about robots that might find its biggest fans among Luddites ""Surrogates"" is an intense and eerily plausible sci-fi thriller. Set in a future that uncannily resembles the present day (it must be one of the first pictures with a car chase featuring a Prius) Jonathan Mostows smart speculative suspenser imagines a time when people can live through ideal versions of themselves while they sit wired up at home. Commercial prospects would seem solid but for the misleading and off-putting ad campaign with very good international and ancillary careers in store for this Bruce Willis starrer. Effective science fiction often reflects the preoccupations and anxieties of the moment when it is made and ""Surrogates"" based on a graphic novel by Robert Venditti and Brett Weldele certainly speaks to the way people today increasingly live on their computers and other electronic devices and project themselves into the world through them. The idea that one day we may need to choose between living life directly or virtually provides the dramatic tension for the script by Mostows ""Terminator 3"" collaborators John Brancato and Michael Ferris. Rapid-fire opening credits montage reveals the technological advances that lead to the ""now"" of the story. With 99% of the population connected to surrogates crime racism and other ills have been eradicated and the streets are filled with nothing but young and attractive people. An amusing entirely credible throwaway scene shows a military war room that resembles an orderly video arcade with a distant desert war being fought by surrogate soldiers (who cant be killed only mechanically damaged) visible on screens. So life is good; everyone is pretty theres no physical danger and people can live out their fantasies from the comfort of their ""stim chairs"" where no one has to see them age. There is a small dropout movement that rejects surrogacy led by a charismatic figure called the Prophet (Ving Rhames) but these scruffy losers are confined to ""reservations"" where they lead a subsistence existence (and are conspicuous by virtue of their exceptional unattractiveness). But trouble comes to paradise when two humans die when their surrogates are ""killed"" which is not supposed to happen. It doesnt take FBI agents Thomas Greer (Willis) and Jennifer Peters (Radha Mitchell) long to figure out that a rebel has gotten his hands on a unique weapon capable of bridging the surrogate/controller divide. Willis appearance is at first disconcerting; with smooth features and a blond toupe he looks about 35 and there is something just a little off about how Greer Peters and others stare dont register reactions immediately and move in ever-so-slightly abrupt ways. They look like heavily retouched photographs come to life through fractional time-delay providing just the right light touch of creepiness to a population that looks as though it stepped out of the pages of Vogue and GQ. Drama turns on how Greer deprived of his surrogate after a hair-raising helicopter pursuit and crash re-enters the world in true human form (Willis with the more familiar bald pate and goatee) much to the consternation of his wife Maggie (Rosamund Pike) whos addicted to the surrogate lifestyle and in a nutshell isnt interested in growing old together. In ""aged"" form Greer sticks out on the streets of Boston like a Rip Van Winkle at a singles bar as he tries to get to the bottom of the mystery which involves a trip to the ""reservation"" for a confrontation with the Prophet and ultimately a search for the elusive inventor of the surrogates Dr. Lionel Canter (James Cromwell) who long ago split with the giant corporation that markets the replicants. Mostow includes sufficient de rigueur action scenes for the popcorn crowd and hes good at them but what keeps the film flying at a comparatively high altitude is the sharply focused manner in which it follows through on its premise. There are aspects of the surrogate lifestyle -- reproduction for starters -- that arent addressed but the picture refuses to be distracted by inessentials and pays off on everything it sets up. ""Surrogates"" distinguishes itself from countless other thematically overlapping films by being not about robots run amok but about humans seduced by the easy life; humanity here has ""advanced"" so far that it has become subordinate to its substitute. As a cautionary sci-fier its not all that far removed from such classics as ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" and ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" and if eyebrows are raised over the issue that ""Surrogates"" runs only 88 minutes its worth remembering that the those two 50s originals ran just 92 and 80 minutes respectively. With the exception of Willis who effectively trots out his wary but determined Everyman persona once his well-scrubbed substitute goes MIA the actors are mostly required to look great and behave with a certain glacial impenetrability which Mitchell Pike Boris Kodjoe (as an FBI supervisor) and James Francis Ginty (as Canters surrogate) lead the way in doing. Devin Ratray gets good mileage out of his role as a computer whiz too proud of his corpulent geekiness to consider a more glamorous substitute. Production values are immaculate.

(Touchstone Pictures) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday September 24 2009 320 PM Title Surrogates If robots had to make a movie without human help ""Surrogates"" is what they might come up with. All the parts are visible but theres no soul to be found.There are seeds of a good idea in Jonathan Mostows sci-fi thriller simply because the movie is based on a graphic novel created to explore deeper issues than the ones glossed over here.The concept is that nearly every human has delegated the task of living to a better-looking invulnerable surrogate or robot. People stay inside hooked up to computers while directing their ""surries"" to work date shop or whatever else they want. Everything changes however when two surrogates are destroyed and their owners die simultaneously. Detectives Greer (Bruce Willis) and Peters (Radha Mitchell) discover the bodies and their investigation unravels a mystery that pits technological overlord Canter (James Cromwell) against human activist The Prophet (Ving Rhames). At the same time Greer has to deal with his sons recent death and the ongoing depression of his wife (Rosamund Pike).Theres no dismissing the timeliness of the movies virtual-reality premise. But screenwriters Michael Ferris and John D. Brancato brush quickly by any significant themes in order to get to the car chases shootouts and explosions. And even those are disappointing since the movie is so poorly shot.Meanwhile the filmmakers were too busy throwing together potential blockbuster material to notice all the loose ends and gaping holes in logic. Which may ultimately explain why Willis looks so confused throughout. Maybe he too is straining to locate some intelligence amid all the machinery.
