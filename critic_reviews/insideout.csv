"Inside Out - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire Inside Out Posted by Christy Lemire on June 24 2015 10 Comments Disney/Pixar Rated PG for mild thematic elements and some action. Running time 94 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four. Heres the main difference between me and my 5-year-old son. I mean clearly there are many including the fact that someday soon hell be able to reach items on the high shelves in the kitchen without a step ladder. But this latest one lies in the way we each reacted to ""Inside Out"" the new animated epic from Pixar which takes place mainly within the mind of an 11-year-old girl. Nicolas favorite part was when the girls sense of Fear (voiced by Bill Hader) runs around screaming with his butt ablaze courtesy of a blast of fire from her Anger (Lewis Black). He also liked when Joy (Amy Poehler) was playfully talking to herself. ""Joy is funny"" the budding film critic added. My favorite part was ... everything else. The ambition. The intelligence. The complexity. The performances. The poignancy. Director and co-writer Pete Docters film is as beautiful as it is profound lively as it is meaningful. This is a movie that dares to explore existential crises in the middle of the summer in an animated movie thats aimed at the whole family. And damned if it doesnt pull it off. Like the best Pixar movies -- ""Up"" ""The Incredibles"" and my personal favorite ""WALL-E"" -- it functions quite powerfully on multiple levels at once. And similar to ""Ratatouille"" in a lot of ways ""Inside Out"" isnt really for kids primarily even though the figure at its center Riley (voiced by Kaitlyn Dias) is on the brink of adolescence with all the recognizable angst that accompanies this shift. Children will certainly respond to the movies spry energy vibrant colors and clever humor. The script from Docter Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley is one of the more substantive ones yet in a Pixar film -- and dont forget Docter previously directed and co-wrote ""Monsters Inc."" and ""Up"" -- but its also very very funny often in a slapsticky way. Er go the butt on fire. A little bit on the premise in case this all sounds a tad confusing and abstract. Riley has just moved from Minneapolis to San Francisco with her parents (Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan). This would be a difficult transition to make at any time in your childhood but especially now. Eleven is such an awkward age -- such a jumble of extreme emotions -- which ""Inside Out"" keenly understands and demonstrates by going inside her brain to show us what shes thinking or feeling at any particular moment. Besides Joy Anger and Fear theres Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith). When Riley was a little girl her experiences and memories were all so clear-cut they were color-coded. The happy ones like scoring her first hockey goal remain in the infrastructure of her brain as orbs that glow a bright yellow; the unpleasant ones like being forced to eat broccoli as an infant radiate a dark green. And the feelings themselves were reliable in their consistency. Joy always has been perky and resilient and glass-half-full (and Poehler does nimble voice work in playing a character thats the pixellated manifestation of her irresistible demeanor). But lately the blue and bespectacled Sadness has come to the fore between the move and all the disconcerting changes occurring both around her and inside her. Reminiscent of Eeyore in the ""Winnie the Pooh"" realm Sadness is dryly hilarious -- so pathetic and so sweet -- and so often the voice of reason. Shes the one whos willing to speak the raw truth in an uncomfortable situation. And Smith with her vulnerable and beautifully nuanced performance ends up being the movies unexpected MVP. From here ""Inside Out"" follows how Riley -- and the many sides of her -- adapt or dont. Her journey features many inspired light moments from the physical manifestation of a brain freeze while youre enjoying a cold treat to an annoying TV jingle that gets stuck in your head. But it has plenty of dramatic ones too including the relationship Rileys emotions have with her long-lost imaginary friend Bing Bong voiced heartbreakingly by Richard Kind. (Seriously ""Inside Out"" rivals ""Toy Story 3"" for the kind of ugly crying itll provoke in you.) It may meander a tad in the literal labyrinth of Rileys mind as these figures struggle to work together to help her restore her shattered sense of self. But mostly ""Inside Out"" remains sharp with some really sophisticated notions about the nature of memories -- which ones we hold onto where they sit in the brain how long we keep them how they shape our personalities and even how they help us forge relationships. It might sound dull or even didactic but this being a Pixar film ""Inside Out"" brings these concepts brilliantly to life. If my son can begin to grasp the idea that happiness and sadness can co-exist within the same moment -- but also cackle so hard at a bit of physical comedy that his face turns red and the veins pop out on his neck -- then were onto something truly memorable here.

The only negative review Ive seen of this film mentioned that they wished that ""Logic"" had been one of the characters inside Rileys head and it looks like they initially planned to have a ""Logic"" character but decided against including it probably because it might have made an already complex film even more complex. As a family film Inside Out is a remarkable achievement. Im glad I took my 5 year old son to see it. We both enjoyed it a great deal. Theres plenty in this film to entertain both adults and children. Reply July 6 2015  by  gigi     Logic does not qualify as one of the basic feelings we have. Reply June 25 2015  by  misery chick     Wonderful review Christy You helped clarify some of the MANY things going on in this wonderfully complex film. Im going to see it again after Ive let it settle in for awhile. NOW FOR A VERY BELATED THANK YOU The first movie review of yours that I read was for ""Walk On Water"" (cant remember the year but it was a looooooong time ago). The subject matter meant absolutely nothing to me (an Israeli assassin hunting down an elderly Nazi war criminal--- blecchh WTF?). Your review explained the human side of the main characters and that was the hook that made me go see it. Since I had taken 3 years of German in high school it was also a chance to see how much auf Deutsch I could remember. Well...the film was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING-beautifully filmed wonderfully written and sublimely acted. It had a hook in my heart from the very beginning (corny I know cant think of a more sophisticated way of expressing it) and the final scene left me on a spiritual high. ""Walk On Water"" is in my top ten movies of my LIFE...and without your review I would have missed this amazing experience. DANKE SCHOEN Reply June 29 2015  by  Anthony Ford     An excellent review and summarizes the concept and purpose of the movie much more completely than I could. I took my 13-year-old daughter and the way she discussed more than just the over-the-top scenes made me realize she went through some self-evaluation as she watched the movie. Im a father who really spent more time with her as a toddler through age 10 than her mother did and I used up most of the napkins that came with her lunch as I wiped at my eyes. I spent a lot of time identifying with the realization about things that were important as a kid being sidelined as kids grow up. I cant imagine that a younger kid like yours could have gotten all that much out of it other than the fun value of the comedic parts mainly because theyre still in the middle of it all. But for preteens (age 10 and up) through grownups this movie is a winner. My heartstrings are still vibrating. Reply July 8 2015  by  Sterling M     I too have spent more time with my ten year old than has her mother. As my daughter is closer to 11 than 10 and weirdly resembles the animated Riley I had a front row seat to her experiencing the film and reflecting on how she related so closely to the emotional ride the movies character went on. I used up my popcorn napkins entirely...and not from wiping my fingers. It was excellent and deeply moving. Reply July 9 2015  by  Christy Lemire     Thanks awesome dads for sharing your thoughtful comments. Glad you enjoyed the movie so much. Reply July 7 2015  by  JozieLee     Our 8 yr-old grandson saw it this weekend. He told us it was about emotions. Then he said ""You should go and see it then call me and well talk about how it made you feel."" WHAT? This kid isnt much of a move goer. And never discusses afterwards. Ill be at tomorrows first showing. Reply July 7 2015  by  JozieLee     Beautiful animation. Just when you think animation has reached perfection someone takes a step further into realism. Cute story. Everything you pointed out about sadness and joy coexisting. Must say tho Lava stole the show for me. Made me homesick for a place I love so dearly. Sweet memories of family and the hope of sharing those memories with my grandson. Mahalo for your delightful review Christy. Reply July 9 2015  by  Christy Lemire     Thanks as always for chiming in Jozie Reply July 9 2015  by  Ryan     To anyone who may want to go watch this bring some tissues Also great review.

By Anthony Lane Anger Fear Joy Disgust and Sadness co-star in Pete Docters new film for Pixar.   Credit Illustration by Mikey Burton The new Pixar film ""Inside Out"" is about the life of Riley. She is an only child (voiced by Kaitlyn Dias) who aged eleven moves with her parents (Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan) from Minnesota to San Francisco. Not much happens she attends a new school tries out for the hockey team and misses her old home. Thats it. No talking cars or robots are involved and theres not a superhero in sight. The bulk of the movie takes place out of sight within the confines of Rileys mind where primary feelings affect her every move. There are five in all Joy (Amy Poehler) who is butter-yellow and fuzzy at the edges; Anger (Lewis Black) who looks like SpongeBob soaked in blood; Fear (Bill Hader) a writhing dweeb with a bow tie; Disgust (Mindy Kaling) who has frosted green hair and lashes; and Sadness (Phyllis Smith) a bespectacled blob of blue. Now and then they contend for supremacy but mostly they join forces and react to the world beyond. They behold it through Rileys eyes from a spiffy control center like Kirk Spock and the gang on the bridge of the Enterprise. Joy and the others are not alone. Around them stretches the vast landscape of Rileys consciousness with a train of thought puffing through it at irregular intervals and other characters wandering about such as Bing Bong (Richard Kind) an imaginary friend from Rileys past who weeps candies and an imaginary floppy-haired boyfriend from her future (""I would die for Riley"" he says). Dreams are produced in--where else?--a dream factory with soundstages and camera crews. It closes down when she wakes. Experiences are delivered to the control room as if they were bowling balls colored according to their mood; some are stored away others dropped into a pit of forgetfulness where they darken and crumble like spent coals and a few are enthroned as core memories. And that we are told is how a personality is made. So brisk is the defining of all this and so efficiently does the director Pete Docter give us the guided tour that we barely pause to consider the assumptions behind it. Pixar though part of Disney has no time for old-school habits like lodging the emotions in the heart a superfluous organ it would seem. They are located squarely in the brain presumably displacing Reason whom we never meet but whom I picture as French bald and wearing an English suit. The presence of Disgust--rather than Boredom say or a bristling Envy (which Riley would certainly need if she had a sibling)--points to a fastidiousness that has typified Pixar from the start. Joy is very much the captain of the team but as events unfold Sadness comes to the fore demonstrating that its O.K. and maybe even helpful to feel low. Neurologists and therapists will examine the movie and pronounce themselves largely satisfied. Has the studio ever supplied a more intensely American product or one more guyed to the anxieties of middle-class aspiration? Five great islands dominate Rileys psyche Family Honesty Friendship Hockey and Goofball better known as messing around. Each is vulnerable to threat; when Riley borrows her moms credit card without asking the isle of Honesty flakes away. Riley also detests her new house which looks like a perfectly nice property in a safe neighborhood and she and her parents are mightily vexed by the late arrival of their stuff in the moving van. A similar vehicle remember figured in the climax of ""Toy Story"" another tale of a childhood defined by its belongings. So much to worry about in such an easy life On the scale of inventiveness ""Inside Out"" will be hard to top this year. As so often with Pixar you feel that you are visiting a laboratory crossed with a rainbow. Even through the graying veil of 3-D glasses the sheen of the image is so acute that it aches and the movie aglow with domestic yearnings should act upon viewers as ""Meet Me in St. Louis"" did in 1944. But who will those viewers be? And might they miss the clearer and less exhausting narrative flow of ""Toy Story""? I saw Docters film with a sizable crowd and noticed a definite rustle of impatience among the smaller kids during the more outre scenes--like the journey that Joy and her pals take through Abstract Thought which flattens them first to 2-D geometric forms and then to mere lines. They emerge as random stars as if in a Miro painting before popping back into shape. Pixars vision of conceptual activity in short is a trip and it sticks out like Dalis dream sequences for Hitchcocks ""Spellbound."" I sensed at such moments that I was following the transcription by very clever adults of their own theorizing--literate frantic and endlessly chewed over--on the subject of human development rather than the story of a growing girl. That is why the biggest laughs without exception come when we exit Rileys head and take a quick vacation to the crania--and the mania--of others. During an argument at dinner for instance her fathers emotions are miles away; all of them are watching a hockey game. And as the closing credits approach Docter realizing that he has a pack of wild gags that have been kept leashed for too long releases the lot in a flurry. We peek inside the mind of a dog a cat a prepubescent boy (""Girl Girl"" the alarms sing out) and best of all the cool chick with eyeshadow at Rileys school voiced by Rashida Jones. (Mind you I would die for Rashida.) You start to wonder what a grownup sequel to ""Inside Out"" would look like with a host of new feelings barging into central command and wrenching the controls away from Joy. Would Lust be spoken by Rupert Everett or would it sound more like Chico Marx working his way through a chorus line? How about Love of Money or black-browed Mortal Terror? There are places I guess where even Pixar cannot go. Bulky and bearded a man lies alone in the dark. Flesh bulges at his waistband. He stirs like a bear emerging from hibernation and we wonder what troubles may have roused him. Handguns clutter a table beside him as if they were coffee cups and yet even at this late hour he takes the time to call his mother and together they say a prayer. Such is the beginning of ""Escobar Paradise Lost"" directed by Andrea Di Stefano. The big man is Pablo Escobar the pasha of an international drug trade. The name has dwindled these days but there was a time when it was larded with awe and dread. ""Medellin Colombia--June 18 1991"" we read onscreen and just to prove it Escobars portable phone is a kind of metal baguette. He is played by Benicio Del Toro who is seldom easy to cast especially as a lead for his pleasure is to sidle into the action from the wings with his sly and drowsy gaze and the viscous slur of his voice. That is why he made more of an impact in the bit part of Fenster in ""The Usual Suspects"" than he did in four and a half hours as the star of Steven Soderberghs ""Che."" In ""Escobar Paradise Lost"" Del Toro has finally found a character who fits him and if there is a temptation to revel so heartily in the role that it bursts at the seams he resists it. Early on a bunch of nervous guys sit awaiting Escobar whose status is not far short of a myth. Rather than make an entrance however he comes into the room as if he were one of them wearing soccer shorts and conversing quietly. Likewise the only weapon that we see him fire is a water pistol in his swimming pool; if there must be blood he has hirelings to do the shedding. Del Toros whole performance is an education in the steady hum of power. Fear not the man who swaggers and rants he suggests but the man who has no need to do so. So why is Escobar not granted dominion over the film that bears his name? For some reason what interests Di Stefano consuming large portions of his movie is the story of Nick (Josh Hutcherson) an aimless Canadian youth who hangs out on a Colombian beach and falls for a girl named Maria (Claudia Traisac). He is welcomed by her nice Uncle Pablo--none other than Escobar who invites the couple to his estate complete with stables elephants and a bullet-riddled car that belonged to Clyde Barrow. Nick slow on the uptake is a little bemused by the style in which Pablo likes to live. ""How did he make all this money?"" he asks Maria obviously expecting her to say ""Dairy farming"" or ""Soft furnishings."" His proud host always at ease in the witching hour wanders into Nicks bedroom one night and inquires ""Do you believe in God?"" ""Yes."" ""Take drugs?"" ""No."" ""Thats good."" Whether or not this counts as a job interview Nick soon finds himself embroiled in the family business and unable to get out at which point ""Escobar Paradise Lost"" turns into a regulation thriller equipped with shootings and sticks of dynamite. Meanwhile everyone in the theatre is thinking Given that I paid good money to learn about the worlds most frightening cocaine king why am I watching a movie about the worlds most stupid Canadian?

You were sorely missed.Over the course of 15 years and nearly a dozen films the animation studio had put together one of the most remarkable runs of sustained excellence in cinematic history culminating with the trifecta of Wall-E (2008) Up (2009) and Toy Story 3 (2010).Related Story Pixars Mood Master But nothing lasts forever. A few members of the studios central brain trust branched out into live-action (Andrew Stanton with John Carter Brad Bird with Mission Impossible - Ghost Protocol and Tomorrowland) head honcho John Lasseter added Walt Disney Animation Studios to his list of responsibilities and Pixar came down with an acute case of sequelitis. Brave (2012) was a solid addition to the canon but it was sandwiched between Cars 2 and Monsters University--almost certainly the two worst movies the studio has produced. The subsequent year 2014 was the first in a decade in which Pixar didnt release any feature at all.But right now none of that matters. Because writer-director Pete Docter--the man responsible for Monsters Inc. arguably Pixars most underrated picture as well as Up its best overall--has now given us Inside Out. At once achingly heartfelt and magnificently high-concept the film tells the story of a girl named Riley (Kaitlyn Dias) and the five emotions that together make up her psyche Joy Sadness Fear Disgust and Anger.Lets begin with the glorious anthropomorphizing of said emotions. Joy (Amy Poehler) is a sunshine-yellow pixie of enthusiasm who presides over the ""control room"" of Rileys mind as a benevolent dictator trying to keep the less-upbeat of her colleagues off the controls. Sadness (Phyllis Smith who played Phyllis on The Office) is blue and blobby unsure of her role and seemingly destined to ruin everything she touches. Fear (Bill Hader) is a purply perpetually jangled nerve-ending and Disgust (Mindy Kaling) is a sickly green guru of sarcastic judgmentalism. Squat blocky Anger is--as if you hadnt already guessed--fire-engine red and voiced by Lewis Black.As its title suggests the true drama (and comedy) of the film takes place inside Rileys head.When the story begins Riley is an 11-year-old coasting through life with Joy firmly at the steering wheel. She has two loving parents (Diane Lane Kyle MacLachlan) and a perfect Minnesota childhood made up of equal parts friendship and ice hockey. But calamity strikes as it so often does in the humblest of ways. Her dad gets a job at a tech startup and he moves the family out to that bleak nowheresville known as the Bay Area. (One of better inside jokes that the Emeryville-based Pixar works into the movie is the portrayal of San Francisco as a kind of miserable anti-utopia gray and foreboding.)Indignities accumulate one upon another The moving van containing all of Rileys furniture and belongings is delayed and delayed again leaving her huddled on the bare floor of her new bedroom in a sleeping bag. Her normally cheery dad is rendered distant and irritable by the demands of his new job. An introductory presentation to her new classmates dissolves into a wave of tears. Even hockey tryouts are a source of frustration. Before long Riley becomes sullen and closed-off snapping at her parents and hanging out alone in her room.But as its title suggests the true drama (and comedy) of the film takes place behind the scenes inside Rileys head. I wont belabor the complex mechanics of the movie but each memory Riley accumulates is like a glass ball colored the hue of the emotion associated with it--overwhelmingly Joy-ish yellow at the start. Some of these balls become ""core memories"" which sustain the ""islands"" that make up Rileys essential personality friendship family hockey etc.As things begin to go awry in Rileys external life so too they fall apart on the inside. Sadness keeps touching happy memories and turning them blue. And when Joy tries to get the situation back to normal she winds up inadvertently exiled to long-term memory with Sadness in tow. Much of the ""action"" of the plot involves their efforts to get back to the control room traversing such terrain as Imagination Land Abstract Thought the Dream Production studio (featuring such classics as ""I Can Fly"" and ""Something is Chasing Me"") and the Subconscious (which were informed is ""where they take all the troublemakers""). There are innumerable clever gags along the way including explanations of why TV jingles get stuck in our heads and how facts and opinions become jumbled together. Most important Joy and Sadness meet Bing Bong Rileys long-forgotten imaginary friend who is voiced wonderfully by Richard Kind and offers many of the films most wistful Toy Story-like moments.If this sounds like a lot of gloopy therapeutic uplift--well it is except for the gloopy part.The real journey of course is not from point A to point B but toward an acceptance of the full breadth of our emotional lives. Joy learns not only that she cant always be in charge but that Sadness--initially dismissed with an ""Im not actually sure what she does""--has an important role to play as well. (Docter was inspired to make the film by the childhood experience of his family moving to Denmark and more immediately by a bout of insecurity that his daughter went through when she was 11.)If this sounds like a lot of gloopy therapeutic uplift--well it is except for the gloopy part. Inside Out is a vibrant witty film full of dazzling visuals and at a zippy 94 minutes wise enough not to let its intricate workings overwhelm its storytelling. And while the lessons it offers may be straightforward theyre eminently useful ones for kids and parents alike. This is Pixar once again at the top of its game telling the kind of thoughtful moving meta-story its hard to imagine being produced anywhere else.See it now. Savor the moment. And do your best to forget that Cars 3 Toy Story 4 The Incredibles 2 and Finding Dory are all rumbling down the pipeline behind it.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place.

Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history.

He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

So Emotional The Sensational High of Inside Out and Utter Shock of The Tribe << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com So Emotional The Sensational High of Inside Out and Utter Shock of The Tribe Pixar Movies June 19 2015 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Youve got to be a little cynical to love the movies. Theres a part of you -- or me anyway -- that wants to be surprised but expects to be disappointed. You want something that at least feels new even if were just talking about reupholstered oldness. But two new movies -- Pete Docter and Pixars Inside Out and a film about young hearing-impaired mafiosi called The Tribe -- sit at opposite artistic poles yet meet in an amazing middle Theyre both interior stories. They both remind you in their respective ways that the movies can still show you something not only that youve never seen but that you never expected to see. Summer Movies 2015 Rex n FX The Charming Jurassic World How Hollywood Grows New Spielbergs Killing It Spy and Sharing Comedic Wealth; Plus the Masturbatory Entourage Mad Max As Hell The Masterful Maniacal Surprisingly Feminist Fury Road Blah Cappella The Mess and Minor Insult of Pitch Perfect 2 Nerd Plus Ultron There Has to Be More to Avengers Age of Ultron Than Printing More Money All of our summer movie content On its surface theres not much to the Pixar film. An 11-year-old Minnesotan named Riley Anderson (voiced by Kaitlyn Dias) is dragged along with her mother (Diane Lane) to San Francisco because her dad (Kyle MacLachlan) has a shaky-sounding new tech job. It means no more hockey a new school and a flood of mixed emotions. But Inside Out keeps leaving that surface of her everyday life cutting away to the heart of the movie a vast warehouse of orb-concealed core memories in Rileys brain staffed by five elemental emotions that have been personified and color-coded. Disgust (Mindy Kaling) is bright green. Anger (Lewis Black) dresses like a comic-book newspaper editor and is built -- and hued -- like a fire hydrant. Fear (Bill Hader) is purple nerdy and insect-thin. Sadness (Phyllis Smith) is a blue teardrop in black glasses a white turtleneck sweater and a terrific side-parted pageboy; shes like Velma from Scooby-Doo with self-esteem too low to realize a dream of selling messenger bags on Etsy. They all more or less stand behind a control panel overseen by Joy (Amy Poehler) a plucky cheerleading go-getter whose yellow skin most resembles a humans and whose outlook and haircut most recall Tinkerbells. Each emotion thinks it serves a purpose for Riley. Joy presumes that hers is the most meaningful especially after the move to a skinny drab San Francisco Victorian. (This is the second movie in the space of a month after San Andreas that refuses to see even a visual upside to this city. And Pixar lives in Emeryville) Indeed most of the memory orbs glow yellow. They do so in a way that suggests Joy is winning the life of Riley at the expense of the other emotions. Theres reason to fear that Docter and the multitudes working with him will prize Joy as a leader more than her coworkers. She certainly thinks as much of herself. And for the first 20 minutes or so the writing has a good time letting the emotions coexist and banter with each other. But the adventure begins when Sadnesss sense of her own superfluousness leads her to touch some of the orbs turning them blue and raising the volume on Joys control-freak politeness. This is a rightly complicated world. The movie divides Rileys personality into a quintet of memory-driven islands -- Family Island Hockey Island Goofball Island etc. -- that bridge out from the control room and have the pinwheeling pop-up-book look of advertisements for amusement parks.1 Sadness touches a particular orb and turns one of Rileys happy memories sad which makes her cry in class. Joy and Sadness tussle causing core memories to come loose. The memories along with Joy and Sadness are sucked up into a tube and deposited in the outer reaches of Rileys brain resulting in the comedy of Disgust Anger and Fear trying to maintain order back at headquarters. Pixar The challenge here involves maintaining a believable humanity while also making an entertaining case that humanity is impossible without the proper emotional configuration. And in meeting that challenge the movie keeps surprising and delighting you. When Rileys truculence starts a spat between her parents the film shifts to their respective headquarters which are reductively gendered. Yet the reduction is vivid clever and most importantly hilarious. Every time the movie returns to that device among the humans and some pets you crack up. The filmmakers have the most fun with that idea and its universality. Its low-risk high-yield comedy but theyve so thoroughly realized these private emotional systems that you cant believe each of them doesnt have its own internal control room. Meanwhile Joy and Sadness have to find a way back from the expanses of Rileys long-term memory which rings a moatlike abyss where old vestigial memories go to die. If they fail Rileys memory islands will collapse and presumably some kind of Alzheimers will set in. The moments when some of these bright islands do go dark feel more shocking than anything in most disaster movies. But the trip allows Pixars ingenuity to flourish. Theres one joke here involving the functional necessity of a boy that is one of the best gags in any of these movies. Theres also a forgotten imaginary playmate called Bing Bong (Richard Kind beautifully milking the poor guys resigned buoyancy) who tries to help Joy and Sadness get home. The adventure doesnt entirely hang together as a movie. Or rather For a stretch the physical action protracts the concept rather than enhances it. Some of Joy and Sadnesss struggle to get back is a slog for both them and us. It feels as if the colors are dimming and the movements are submerged in something almost amniotic. In truth theyre just walking and running and eventually falling into that pit of discarded memories. But as they wander fretfully through candied gloaming and attempt to climb out of the depression of that abyss the movie presents its own abstracted version of the Slough of Despond. That guilt doesnt belong to Joy or Sadness. Its a strange unconscious despondence over all the accumulated waste in a life -- wheres the line between instrumental and excremental? This girl is 11. I cant imagine whats in the abyss of her parents. But this is where your mind goes during this movie to the pricelessness and preciousness of time to a consideration of the unknowable zones of human consciousness. And confirming what goes on as we live is actually as impossible as truly knowing what happens after we die We know and yet we dont. Pixars attempt to render this is a bit boring but perhaps boring in the way that certain master directors like Andrei Tarkovsky can be boring as a dare to contemplate existence and time. With Pixar at this point eliciting boredom might be a showoff move -- the way Toni Morrison can give you two full pages of run-on lists or Serena Williams will close out a championship match with four straight aces. It can do this and still give you a very good movie. Your boredom is for Pixar principled -- fleeting too; a break from laughter or widened eyes. I preferred the slowness to the goofy stuff at the climax. Inside Out remains unbusy just long enough to achieve poignant philosophical rumination. Some of that achievement is a matter of rareness a movie situated entirely within the brain of a girl whose two primary emotions are gendered as female. But a lot of it has to do with the gathering of wisdom. Docter also directed Up a handsomer deeply emotional movie with more breathtaking action set pieces. The new movie compounds the feat of the previous one not by personifying a single emotion but by recognizing the strength of combining them while punching up the sadness setting on the emotional equalizer. (This was the beauty of the preamble to Up too.) Generally sadness tends to be the object of fear anger and disgust. Here its a base and Smith is marvelous at bringing it to life. She speaks in the flatland cadences of the American Midwest a grandmother-librarian whos never at the center of anything more cultural than a family portrait. Smith who played Phyllis on the American Office is a glorious contrast to Poehlers heroic pep. I found Sadnesss wimpiness and dumpiness annoying initially. But the movie gets behind her self-doubt until its empowered. Youre rooting for the movie to take what she represents seriously and its moving when it finally does. The best of Pixar reckons with states of existence and questions of the soul -- what makes us human whether were rats unwanted robots or made of plastic. Inside Out might be the most improbable of all of Pixars films since its the least external and least explicable. But its unquenchable curiosity also puts it among the most wondrous of its ilk or any American film. This is a studio that has always cherished moods -- presented them in phases not as swings. More than once I wondered where Inside Out would go. Given the surplus of color and the honest range of feeling the answer is as much under the rainbow as over it.  Arthouse Traffic Inside Out is verbalized. The Tribe is gesticulated. Its an utter astonishment set at a Ukrainian boarding school for the deaf. The building that houses these kids feels like a bureaucratic annex large forbidding creaky rid of comfort and love rottenly corrupt. It makes anything in Dickens seem like an episode of Captain Kangaroo. And like most of what comes our way from Eastern Europe the movie doubles as an allegorical X-ray of national spiritual decay. The story is as simple as Pixars. A shy new student (Grygoriy Fesenko) gets mixed up in the organized crime that infests the school and spills beyond its walls. The story visits seemingly endless rows of parked tractor trailers for the nightly pimping and prostitution of two merry-but-hardened female roommates -- a plate-faced blonde (Yana Novikova) and a frowning brunette (Rosa Babiy) -- by their boyfriends. Other extracurricular activities include the beating and robbery of strangers and the new kids natural but morally misguided attachment to the blonde. The scenes come in plain signed dispatches that writer and director Miroslav Slaboshpitsky has opted not to translate or subtitle into any language. For a hearing audience this gives the movie its cinematic complexity. The actors are deaf so the signing perhaps with the directors encouragement becomes intoxicatingly elegant. And over the course of the films 132 minutes as the characters and behavior and story cohere the elegance becomes unbearable and ugly. The entire time youre watching a silent film. The sounds of slapping flesh and rustling fabric and rooms being tossed in desperate rage become a soundtrack. This is to say that in addition to a silent film The Tribe is also a musical. Slaboshpitsky began his career as a crime reporter and a movie like this makes you eager to read his prose. Each scene is a paragraph of action presented in a single take in which the actors fill the space with sour charisma and sharp and lilting hand motions. The smooth camerawork by Valentyn Vasyanovych (whos the editor too) is a creepy wonder sitting stock still then pulling out to create tracking shots as graceful as the sign language. The bodies tell the story the way they do in modern dance but upside down with arms and hands doing the work of legs and feet. Some of the movement -- an early classroom scene an outdoor fight not much later in which the new kid is overmanned -- feels straight out of Bob Fosse gorgeous dangerous psychological. Theres a long grim interlude at the apartment of an abortionist that feels like something out of a nightmare ballet. The womans hair is pulled back so tightly as she dances from her kitchen to the room in which she brutally preps her patient that you feel as though you can see her skull. There is a small but not insignificant attention to comedy and you cling to it until its gone. The early scenes feel a bit like a put-on. The boys all wear dark suits and white shirts. They look like theyre auditioning for Reservoir Dogs. When they slip into tracksuits its Goodfellas. But after a few scenes its clear that Slaboshpitsky isnt doing Bugsy Malone despite the absence of a single kind or moral adult. Hes serious. And hes intelligent. The movie is set in a world in which sound exists and more than once we see the dire consequences of the deaf caught unaware. A gang of kids make the new boy strip to his skivvies on his first day. But you notice that hes in alarmingly good shape. Its something you think about as the sociological drama turns into a thriller and the thriller turns into a horror film. That strength matters. To hear this might be to wonder why youd want to see the film. Its black as tar and affirming only of our grimmest selves. Slaboshpitsky guides this tale from mischief to tragedy the way one might drive a hearse. But you are in the presence of an artist who has complete control of his material in the fatless waste-free style that Michael Haneke works. The final sequence is an appalling rush. I left the theater and had no idea which direction to walk. I was knocked out in the way that a work of art can leave you knock-kneed but also in the sense of being powerfully morally disoriented and dismayed. I wanted to tell the world to see this movie. I also wanted to call the police. Not unlike the ones owned by the company that also owns Pixar and this website. Filed Under Movies Pixar Walt Disney Co.

"Inside Out | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; inside-out ) Inside Out (United States 2015) June 19 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli No American animated studio has been as successful developing films that work on multiple levels as Disney/Pixar. From the beginning they have been interested in telling stories that equally engage children and adults. Consider Toy Story 3 for example. For kids its a lively funny adventure. For adults its a bittersweet meditation on the passage of time. I wont argue that Inside Out is as profound or all-around engaging as Toy Story 3 but the films succeed in many of the same ways. Inside Out ventures into deep psychological territory which may make it a hard sell for the littlest of children. The filmmakers (in particular Pete Docter whose previous animated forays include Monsters Inc. and Up) include plenty of action/adventure set pieces and family-friendly comedy to keep youngsters involved but the main text is arguably the most complex of any Pixar outing. The movie uses anthropomorphized emotions to explore themes about how the entirety of an individuals personality is shaped on a foundation of memories and that regret is a necessary part of awareness. The depth of the subject matter belies that cuteness of the animated creatures populating the screen. The Pixar brain trust venerates veteran Japanese filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki and never have they previously come this close to replicating the feel of a Studio Ghibli production. The main character is an ordinary girl named Riley (voice of Kaitlyn Dias). She and her mom (Diane Lane) and dad (Kyle MacLachlan) have relocated to the Bay Area for work-related reasons. Riley is sad and depressed - she misses her old house her friends her hockey team - pretty much everything. Shes trying to stay upbeat but its hard. Although bits of the story are told from Rileys perspective the lions share of the narrative transpires literally within her head. Thats where we meet the five emotions that control her moods organize her memories and influence her actions yellow upbeat Joy (Amy Poehler) blue Sadness (Phyllis Smith) purple Fear (Bill Hader) red Anger (Lewis Black) and green Disgust (Mindy Kaling). When something goes wrong and Joy and Sadness are inadvertently ejected from the ""Control Room"" we begin perhaps the strangest road trip since Fantastic Voyage a trek through Rileys subconscious. Along the way there are some odd encounters including one with the girls one-time imaginary friend Bing Bong (Richard Kind). Inside Out takes complex psychological processes and simplifies them in ways that make them relatable and relevant. The film enters deep waters without getting too dark - we are treated to glimpses of the personality deterioration that occurs once Joy and Sadness (and their associated memories) have been removed. She shuts down becomes uncommunicative and eventually makes the decision to run away. Inside Out has no villain. This is often the case with road trip movies but rarely with animated films where the desire for black-and-white clarity makes demands upon the screenwriters. Nevertheless the narrative isnt about defeating a bad guy; instead its about a bunch of mismatched creatures attempting to restore balance. The art style is un-Pixar-like.  Although the ""outside"" scenes with Riley and her parents are designed with the realism we have become accustomed to in modern animated films the ""inside"" material has a fantastical almost hand-drawn appearance - a shimmery cartoonish look that Pixar hasnt previously attempted.  This not only gives Inside Out its own identity but provides a different appearance in a genre where the look is becoming increasingly generic. (The 3-D however is useless - surprisingly its as if Pixar really didnt try.) In recent years Pixar has been in a rut with two mediocre sequels a year off and several unspectacular (but entertaining) original productions. To use the cliche Inside Out represents a ""return to form."" The open question is how the under-8 crowd will relate to it. This isnt Minions-style high energy hijinks. It requires thought and consideration.  Those are unquestionably laudable qualities but are they antithetical to a big box office?

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jun. 19 2015 1200AM EDT Last updated Saturday Jun. 20 2015 945PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Pete Docter Ronnie del Carmen Written by Pete Docter Meg LeFauve Josh Cooley Starring Amy Poehler Phyllis Smith Lewis Black Mindy Kaling Genre family Country USA Language English Inside Out earned some deep responses when it premiered at Cannes last month with more enthusiastic reviewers promising it would outlive cinema itself suggesting the movie could re-orient how we think about human thought. I thought it was fun but ... lets just say its often true that movies about going inside peoples heads from The Wizard of Oz to Being John Malkovich tend to get inside peoples heads. Lets start with a more modest claim Inside Out is imaginative and ambitious even if it sometimes feels a bit manically overstuffed. And its definitely a big step up from some recent Pixar films such as Cars 2 and Monsters University.""Do you ever look at someone and wonder what is going on inside their head?"" asks Joy (Amy Poehler) but its a trick question because shes about to show you that you have absolutely no idea.Shortly after were introduced to Riley as a newborn baby. Inside her tiny noggin behind her blinking eyes theres a Star Trek-style control centre in a Space Needle-style tower.Joy with yellow glowing skin and blue hair really likes to operate the controls. Along with her is the blue bespectacled Sadness (Phyllis Smith) purple Fear (Bill Hader) fat red firecracker Anger (Lewis Black) and snooty green Disgust (Mindy Kaling).Our story jumps to a crisis when Riley (voiced by Kaitlyn Dias) now a hockey-loving tomboy of 11 is put under stress. Her parents (Kyle MacLachlan and Diane Lane) decide to move from Minnesota to San Francisco where her father has a new tech job and mom doesnt seem to do much except feel sad.The external world that Riley lives in is depicted in the photo-realistic style we know from other Pixar movies but more everyday-shabby San Francisco looks grey; her new townhouse home is a dump. Theres a dead mouse in her room (cue Disgust) and the local pizza has broccoli on it (cue Disgust once more).Up in the control room memories - shaped like small coloured bowling balls - are sent by pneumatic tubes into the giant theme park of the brain. Because Riley is out of sorts Sadness keeps touching things and making them turn blue. Joy who keeps trying to keep everyone else in line loses control She and Sadness are ejected out of Headquarters and into the brain. Fear Anger and Disgust are left in charge.As depicted in Inside Out the brain is a kind of Dali-esque fantasy park. Much of it consists of a giant maze with walls made of what appear to be huge gumball machines filled with coloured spherical memories. Around them connected by thin bridges are a series of ""islands of personality"" built of core memories with such titles as Friendship Family Goofball and Honesty.In other words its a bit busier and more entertaining than what typically goes on in my head though theres even less evidence of anyone in charge. There are however menial workers discarding phone numbers and old piano lessons (like the recent Jurassic World the movie seems inspired by issues in theme-park maintenance). Theres also a dark abyss full of lost memories underneath and an automatic ""train of thought"" that runs around it like a monorail at the zoo.Among the train stops is a place where dreams are created on a studio lot which seems a little obvious. A wittier idea is a place called Abstract Thought. Its a shortcut to Headquarters but the characters risk being reduced to Picasso drawings and then mathematical shapes before they get there.While Joy (dragging Sadness by the heels which is not a bad depiction of depression) struggles to get back to Headquarters out in the ""real"" world of unexpectedly crummy-looking San Francisco Riley is having a sad bad time. Shes embarrassed at school misses her friends and lashes out at her parents. Our heartstrings get tugged (though that would be another movie).Inside Rileys head happy memories are disappearing the ""islands of personality"" are crumbling and an imaginary childhood friend depicted as a pink cotton candy elephant named Bing Bong (Richard Kind) refuses to be forgotten. In the Subconscious a malevolent birthday clown stirs.Through the films busy middle section with its bright colours and blink-and-theyre-gone visual gags sometimes it feels a little like having cartoon characters stomping all over your own brain. At least the Emotions are entertaining and less one-dimensional than you might think. Lewis Blacks Anger takes great joy in blowing his top while Sadness has a tender warmth for miserable thoughts.If the mechanism of Inside Out seems both simplistic and complicated the message is straightforward Its okay to feel sad mad scared or disgusted. Sometimes those feelings are even downright enjoyable. Report Typo/Error Follow Liam Lacey on Twitter liamlacey More Related to this Story Will Pixar bounce back from sequel slump with Inside Out?

Pixar fans will be in seventh heaven with the films bold thinking--and kids will be straining to listen to imaginary voices in their heads--after diving into the mind of Riley an 11-year-old girl whose tiny world is turned upside down when she moves from Minnesota to San Francisco with her mom and dad. Its a simple story featuring a new school and nervous parents. But the real drama goes on in Rileys head where we meet Joy (Amy Poehler) Fear (Bill Hader) Anger (Lewis Black) Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith) each of them sharing a physicality to match their temperament. Disgust gives great sneer while Anger is red squat and prone to shooting fire out of his head. We watch each of them fight for control over Rileys life and when Joy and Sadness go AWOL from their psychological HQ we take a tour of some crazy mental byways including the Abstract Thinking Department where Joy and Sadness briefly become 2-D characters and then momentarily one-color squiggles. Theres too much to sponge up in one viewing. Blink and youll miss a character saying ""These facts and opinions look so similar"" when passing boxes marked ""Facts"" and ""Opinions."" We leave the subconscious (""where they take all the troublemakers"") too quickly and then its on to the Dream Department where we see the days memories being adapted into drama. At times you ache to put the brakes on the chaos but still Pixar manages to do what they do best turning the everyday rough and smooth of childhood experience into a thoughtful inventive adventure full of lurid and strange imagery yet still totally appopriate. Itll be interesting to see how young kids react. I imagine theyll find it less confusing than their parents and even if some of the more heady stuff goes right over their well heads theres always the Imaginary Friend--part elephant part cat all pink--to enjoy while the parents give each other a side-glance of recognition.

It has comedy drama and suspense. Inside Out is about a young girl going through puberty moving away from her friends and all the emotions life brings.

Inside Out is a magical Pixar film which takes you ""behind the scenes"" of the what goes on in the head of ours. As a kid it offers everything you want from comedy to action to suspense (kid friendly of course). Ultimately good prevails and we have a happy ending (as we do with all Pixar films) but the fact it was appropriate for adults too is why Im giving it a great score. I grew up on these type of movies so to be able to watch it again with my little niece and not look at the watch was quite a relief. I cant give it a 5-star because it wasnt on the Finding Nemo or Toy Story level but Ill take it.

(Disney-Pixar via AP)More""Inside Out"" the latest Pixar punch to the heart navigates the labyrinth of a young girls mind in an antic candy-colored romp through childhood memory to arrive finally gloriously at epiphany.By now its a familiar Pixar trajectory from wackadoodle to waterworks We know its coming and we know theres nothing we can do about it. The wave of tender nostalgia is going to crash down and wash us -- happy misty-eyed saps -- out to sea maybe with Nemo and Dora swimming alongside.Those moments sentimental and sublime come in unlikely places the sudden understanding of a forgotten toy the astonished realization of a bitter food critic the flashback of a grouchy old man. The epiphanies are almost invariably about giving into the natural course of life and time An acceptance a letting go.Part of the magic is that even when out in space or in a rat-run restaurant Pixar films stay earthbound. Whats most striking about ""Inside Out"" isnt its inside-the-brain gee-whiz design but that its probably Pixars most directly human story yet An 11-year-old girl growing up.Its an event observed and subtly manipulated by a gaggle of voices in the head of young Riley Joy (Amy Poehler) an effervescent pixie-haired burst of positivity; Sadness (Phyllis Smith) a blue-tinged bespectacled mope; Anger (Lewis Black) a red block of fury; Fear (Bill Hader) a perpetually nervous squiggle; and Disgust (Mindy Kaling) a snobbish socialite.From inside the ""headquarters"" of her head the quintet have all watched Riley (Kaitlyn Dias) compile personality-forming memories each of which rolls into headquarters like a glowing pinball to be filed away accordingly in places like long-term memories or the more central ""core memories.""Things begin going haywire when Riley and her parents (Diane Lane Kyle MacLachlan) move from Minnesota -- the scene of her idyllic hockey-playing youth -- to a rundown San Francisco town house. Sadness begins creeping into her core memories jeopardizing Joys previously unchallenged sunny supremacy.In trying to prevent this scourge of unhappiness Joy and Sadness get sucked into the recesses of Rileys mind where they must find a way back through a maze of realms like Imagination Land and Dream Productions a nightly movie studio of dreams.The interior architecture is bright and clever -- theres literally a train of thought -- but the psychology puns drag. Much of the mindscape adventures will surely sail over the heads of many younger viewers while others will eventually tire of its ""Inception""-like trip into the brain. (An exception is Bing Bong an abandoned imaginary friend played by Richard Kind who cries candy and seems created to prove how Pixar can make literally anything break your heart.)Better is the tenderly depicted daily life of Riley as she struggles to adjust to a new school and city. ""Inside Out"" directed by Pete Docter and co-directed by Ronnie Del Carmen steadily builds in emotional power aided massively by Michael Giacchinos beautifully soft and sweet score (he also scored ""Up"" and ""Ratatouille"").""Inside Out"" may be about a young girl but its really from a parents perspective -- even the inside voices are guardians of Riley adjusting as she matures out of childhood. As he did with ""Up"" Docter has married a rainbow-colored palate with a gentle fable mixing real and fantasy sometimes awkwardly but always with warm-heartedness.Whats most refreshing about ""Inside Out"" is its inversion of the standard prescriptions of big-budget animation Its ultimately about the importance of embracing sadness. This you may have noticed isnt exactly the conventional moral one generally finds at the multiplex.But its a fitting lesson to be imparted by Pixar a master juggler of emotion that has so often moved us with radiant bursts of feeling. Who better to remind us of the value of a good cry?""Inside Out"" a Walt Disney Pictures release is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association of America for ""mild thematic elements and some action."" Running time 95 minutes. Three and a half stars out four.___MPAA definition of PG Parental guidance suggested.

Pixar hide caption toggle caption Pixar Fear (Bill Hader) Joy (Amy Poehler) and Disgust (Mindy Kaling). Pixar Pixars Inside Out is the perfect tool for coming to grips with what has happened to Pixar itself. The films most valuable insight is that its natural to feel sad about growing up which is true even when the thing growing up is a movie studio that has shepherded countless childhoods. As of late the vibrant creative energies that produced WALL-E Up and The Incredibles seemed to be fading into the past as the Disney-owned company did the adult thing capitalize on its brand potential (Cars 2 Monsters University) at the expense of the unfiltered imagination that defined its younger years. So go ahead. Be sad or angry or disgusted or afraid. Its normal. When were lucky though sadness can also bring joy and Inside Out is joyous indeed. Enter 11-year-old Riley (Kaitlyn Dias) who seems to be the films hero but is in fact the. . . setting. Hold that thought. In her early childhood in Minnesota Riley was living the dream hyper-attentive parents good friends and youth hockey stardom. Now her dad is moving the family to San Francisco where she knows no one at school her parents are suddenly too busy for her and hipster chefs have ruined pizza by slapping broccoli on top. The horrors of adolescence arent making these changes any easier to stomach as all survivors of that traumatic era can attest. We know how Riley feels. In fact we know her better than weve known any character in film history. From the beginning directors Pete Docter (Up) and Ronaldo Del Carmen plunge us inside her mind to meet her emotions firsthand--the true heroes. What do emotions look like? Turns out they look like Disney cartoons brightly colored sprites with effervescent shimmering skin as though ready to burst at any moment. Theres Joy (Amy Poehler) a Tinkerbell-ish golden girl who only wants to keep her host happy; Sadness (Phyllis Smith) a hunched-over turtlenecked moaner who seems to turn Rileys memories as blue as she is; and their three coworkers high-strung Fear (Bill Hader) posh Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Anger (Lewis Black in the role he was born to play) so hotheaded he shoots fire from his noggin when he boils over. They work in ""Headquarters"" a giant control room (think the Bridge on Star Trek) with buttons and switches to control Rileys actions and their work produces the girls hard-earned memories which take the form of colorful glowing orbs that replay moments on a continuous loop like GIFs in a snow globe. Hang tight because theres a lot more going on inside Rileys and this films wonderfully warped mind. (Docters inspiration was his own adolescent daughters changing emotional state.) Half the fun is the surprise of seeing what turns up so a spoiler warning is necessary here The familys big move touches off a round of infighting in Headquarters as Joy tries to squeeze Sadness out of the picture for what she believes is the good of Rileys health. But her efforts backfire and the two are launched to the furthest recesses of the girls headspace leaving Fear Disgust and Anger running the ship. To get back Joy and Sadness will have to hitch a ride on--what else?--Rileys Train of Thought. The pairs odd-couple journey gives us a grand tour of the brains many wonders. These include the impossibly deep storage facility that keeps and recalls memories and a literal dream theater--a Tinseltown studio backlot where a film crew in Rileys subconscious stages her nighttime entertainments. Each new stop is another masterstroke in visual storytelling and the film boasts Pixars most ambitious production designs to date. Though theres a candy-colored vibe to everything reminiscent of midcentury filmstrips theres also a darkness bubbling a sense that maybe Sadness isnt so misplaced in the psyche of this rapidly maturing youth. Given how easy it would have been for Joy and Sadness to feel like exhausting caricatures Poehler and Smiths voice work is all the more remarkable. The stellar actors help turn their feelings into fully realized characters in ways that may even override their purpose in the story (how can Joy feel sad? Does that make sense?). The idea of a collection of separate beings wrestling over control of a human smacks on paper of the early-90s sitcom Hermans Head or the Eddie Murphy comedy Meet Dave in which tiny aliens in Murphys skull turned his every action into flamboyant performance art. But Docters team pulls off a seamless fluidity between ""real"" life and the wild abstract life of the mind. Even though five distinct personalities are behind the wheel Rileys actions and reactions never feel anything but human and she aches and jumps for joy just like everyone. Its this commitment to humanity that makes a seemingly low-stakes climax--Angers misguided solution to Rileys California woes--pack such an emotional wallop. Whats the worst that could happen? How about deep irreparable rifts in a childs mental health? Inside Out is only 94 minutes long but stuffed with enough loving detail for five movies. What about the intricate designs of those ""personality islands"" formed from Rileys core memories? Or Bing-Bong the imaginary friend from childhood? The ""Abstract Thought"" chamber a treat for animation geeks? Above all there is the films stealthy insightful approach to child psychology and its wonderful distillation of concepts that most filmmakers would never attempt to express in this medium. The movie is unabashed about its sentimentality because its teaching us about the raw power of sentiment This is how memories are formed. Inside Out isnt just a sign of renewed youth from Pixar. Its the reason Pixar exists. A note on the preshow The latest Pixar short is ""Lava"" a love ballad sung between two volcanoes. Sadly its one of the companys weakest short films to date lacking the clever conceits of classics like ""Gerrys Game"" and ""Night And Day."" Your brain will be sending the ukulele theme song up to Headquarters for weeks after and no thats not a good thing.

Not since ""Up"" has the studio taken on the gnarliness of being human and made it so visually delightful and emotionally resonant. Playful and instructive ""Inside Out"" is an extended graduate-level ""Sesame Street."" Its nearly as intriguing a challenge to imagine the wavy wondrous contours of the minds responsible for this entertaining and philosophically rich animated story of 11-year-old Riley (Kaitlyn Dias) and the emotions headquartered in her brain regulating moods and memory the stuff of personality. Pete Docter -- along with co-director Ronaldo Del Carmen -- has taken a giant stride toward fixing what has ailed the animation whiz factory which for so many a film could do no wrong. Docter directed and wrote ""Up."" Amy Poehler voices Joy the leader of a colorful crew that includes Anger (Lewis Black) Fear (Bill Hader) and Disgust (Mindy Kaling). The voice talent works its charms. Poehler is appropriately zippy and can-do. Blacks full-throttled bluster is hilariously employed. But it is Phyllis Smiths performance as Sadness that makes me happiest. The actress from TVs ""The Office"" is brilliant as Joys most complicated colleague. Glum rotund Sadness is exhausted and exhausting. Shes an impossible Eeyore even if Joys pooh-poohing of every bad feeling that nibbles at happy child Riley cant possibly be right. Sadness can be destructive. Every time she touches a shiny memory she can taint it changing its hue from golden to blue and Rileys long-term memories from glad to irrevocably sad. Its a situation that hyper-vigilant Joy guards against. But when Riley her dad (Kyle Mac Lachlan) and mom (Diane Lane) relocate from Minneapolis to San Francisco things get precarious. Theres a strange house on a narrow street; a new school with popular girls; a new climate not entirely conducive to Rileys beloved sport hockey. All the while Sadness is touching stuff in Headquarters The more Joy tries to curtain Sadness the more she seems to endanger Rileys customary cheer. And then the unthinkable happens Joy and Sadness are sucked into the space where long-term memories are stored. The place looks like a warren of gumball machines. And atolls of identity representing Rileys different personality traits also hover in that space. As things start to go awry these vital edifices dissolve (like the memories in Christopher Nolans ""Inception""). Joy and Sadness will have help in their quest to get back to Headquarters for the sake of Riley. Richard Kind proves a touchingly amusing guide as Rileys old imaginary friend Bing Bong. I wouldnt want to vet the scientific ins and outs of ""Inside Out."" But a terrifically written scene at the family dinner table -- with a peek into Mom and Dads own control centers -- hints at what the vibe in Headquarters might be like as Riley ages. Turns out Joy Sadness and their fellow emotions have their own growing up to do.

By Dana Stevens Sadness Fear Anger Disgust and Joy in Inside Out. Image courtesy Disney/Pixar So many of the most emotionally powerful moments in the Pixar movie canon have to do with the passage of time through a life and the passage of a life through time. Sometimes that life is represented by a doll as in the heartbreaking ""When She Loved Me"" flashback montage in Toy Story 2 or the even more composure-destroying ending of Toy Story 3. Sometimes its a robot as in the sublime first third of Wall-E a near-silent meditation on loneliness and loss. And sometimes the life is one thats more recognizably like our own as in the entire novels worth of insights about love marriage and mortality packed into the less-than-five-minute-long montage near the beginning of Up. The happy endings of these movies--like the happily ever afters of traditional fairy tales--arent just feel-good story resolutions. Theyre affirmations of the value of hope resilience and human (or doll or robot) connection even in the face of certain disaster. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. In Pixars astonishing new movie Inside Out directed by Ups Pete Docter and co-written by Docter Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley that disaster is located inside the head of an 11-year-old girl Riley (voiced by Kaitlyn Dias) whose family has just moved from Minnesota to San Francisco pitching her into the first major emotional crisis of her life. In a storytelling convention thats at least as old as the 1966 sci-fi film Fantastic Voyage--another example that springs to mind is Madeleine LEngles great novel A Wind in the Door--Inside Out cuts between two parallel storylines one taking place around Riley the other inside her. At the controls in this mixed-up kids brain is a mixed-up bunch of personified emotions Joy (Amy Poehler); Sadness (Phyllis Smith); Anger (Lewis Black); Fear (Bill Hader); and Disgust (Mindy Kaling). Up until now these temperamentally disparate colleagues have worked together pretty well as a team manning the controls at headquarters to assure Rileys day-to-day well-being. But given that the little girl in question is a happy well-loved child its Joy whos pretty much ruled the roost. As Rileys misery about her new circumstances grows--she misses her friends her parents are anxious about money and work shes ignored by the cool girls at school--the conditions at headquarters worsen with Joy and Sadness eventually forced to make a journey deep into Rileys ... brain? Soul? Heart? Memory? What exactly is the interior landscape Inside Out maps out with such visual inventiveness and wealth of geographical detail?--in order to restore her emotional equilibrium and capacity for happiness. Advertisement If youre a filmgoer who likes to play around with ideas--and I think we do young children a disservice by assuming they dont though I suspect there must be a developmental stage before which Inside Outs conceit would be unintelligible--discovering the rules by which Rileys headspace operates is the single best thing about Inside Out. So Ill just say that there are these things called ""core memories""--glowing orbs containing key images from the past sort of like portable crystal balls--that must be protected at all costs. As Joy and Sadness make their way through the theme park-like land of Rileys imagination or across the hazardous plains of abstract thought (where Sadness warns ""If we dont hurry pretty soon well be nothing but shape and color"") Joy carries these crucial memories in a backpack given to her by Rileys imaginary friend Bing Bong (Richard Kind) who joins them in the course of their travels. Bing Bong a vaguely elephant-shaped pink creature with a body made of cotton candy and a nose he can toot like a trumpet has had little to do since Riley stopped playing with him years ago and hes happy to lend his brain-wandering expertise to the lost emotions on their search for a way home. But--in Rileys family life as well as inside her head--no one really has a clue what the hells going on and pretty soon the whole emotion-management team finds itself in disarray as she slips into full-on preadolescent crisis. Fittingly the music by faithful Pixar troubadour Michael Giacchino is clean bright and playful but tinged with a recurring note of melancholy a perfect match for the rainbow-colored but sometimes menacing brain-world designed by the studios magical animation team. Rileys outer world feels like a realistic version of San Francisco and she and her parents (Kyle MacLachlan and Diane Lane) are recognizable and relatable human beings--but I cant quite say that Inside Outs ""real"" people ever seem as real as its cast of anthropomorphized feelings whose shape color and movement express their inner being with a clarity computer-animated human flesh cannot match. Still the voice actors in both universes give such across-the-board strong performances that neither the denizens of Rileys head nor those of her San Francisco home ever come off as generic stand-ins for a family role or an idea. As the droopy and Eeyore-like but ultimately indispensable character of Sadness The Offices Phyllis Smith pretty much steals the show--no small act of larceny when youre acting opposite the likes of Poehler and Kind. Top Comment As a father of two both in the range of the girl featured in this film I teared up a little just reading the review.  More... -TheDude Join In Only in the medium of animation could a conceit as elaborate as Inside Outs be dramatized and only animation this well-designed and executed could bring such a story so vibrantly to life. Inside Out is an allegory in the old-fashioned sense of the term a digitally animated Pilgrims Progress or Divine Comedy that ushers its heroines (and us) through an uncharted land in which the ideas beliefs and memories that shape our daily lives take on physical form. Riley is never aware of the crisis taking place inside her head except as it manifests in her constantly changing moods. Yet those moods are conveyed in both worlds with such visual imagination and emotional immediacy that its evident to anyone in the audience--certainly to the 9-year-old who sat entranced at my side--how the macro- and micro-narrative universes interrelate and affect one another. Nor are the goings-on at Riley HQ simply a reflection of whatevers happening in her outer reality. Often story developments in the brain-world add nuance and complexity to some aspect or other of getting older--the central story of every human life. As Inside Out is aware to a degree thats rare in kids movies growing up is both a grand triumph and an irreversible tragedy. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Disney/PixarSadness (voiced by Phyllis Smith) Fear (Bill Hader) Anger (Lewis Black) Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Joy (Amy Poehler) deal with emotional chaos in Inside Out.(Photo Pixar)Its good to get your emotions in check before watching the exquisite Inside Out. Youre bound to feel the whole bunch watching a childs mind come alive in the most imaginative ways.Directed by Pete Docter -- the man behind indelible Pixar classics Up Toy Story and WALL-E -- the animated film (1/2 out of four; rated PG; opens Friday nationwide) peeks at the goings-on in the noggin of 11-year-old Riley (voiced by Kaitlyn Dias).USA TODAYWomen of Inside Out Keep emotions realSince the girl was born the incessantly cheery Joy (Amy Poehler) has been running the show and pushing the right buttons in the control center of Rileys brain alongside her crew of Sadness (Phyllis Smith) Fear (Bill Hader) Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Anger (Lewis Black). But Rileys life and internal feelings are thrown into turmoil when she leaves her friends and hockey team behind moving from Minnesota to San Francisco with her parents (Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan).The outside stress factors turn into brainy chaos for the five colorful characters when Sadness accidentally creates trouble and she and Joy end up in Rileys memory banks. They go on an epic quest to rejoin their friends at headquarters journeying through towers of memories. Various metaphysical obstacles come alive as parts of Rileys personality crumble around them -- a metaphor for the youngster transitioning toward her teenage years.USA TODAYInside Out brings joy back to PixarPixar is known for its deft balancing of gut-busting comedy and actual drama and the animation studio does so again with Inside Out. Yet its also the smartest project theyve ever had in mapping out a landscape for its key players. Everyday aspects of human life get extraordinarily creative explanations It totally makes sense that dreams are like tiny Hollywood productions or that a couple of working-class folks having a little fun is why a chewing-gum jingle turns into an earworm.The main voice actors all fit their animated personas especially Poehler and Black. Poehler brings a unshakably quirky optimism to Joy while Black takes his acerbic stand-up routine makes it a smidge more family-friendly and turns up the juice for Anger. He continually blows his top in volcanic fashion when ticked off -- which happens a lot -- and the gag never gets old.USA TODAYHow Pixar created Inside Out emotionsFears jittery neuroses and Joys shiny nature will capture the hearts of smaller audience members yet Inside Out is heartbreaking at times for adults especially parents. It reminds that time is fleeting and that children grow up quickly -- the top-hatted quasi-cat/elephant Bing Bong (Richard Kind) Rileys former imaginary friend cries candy tears but its adults who will need tissues as they see his story arc play out.But thats where Inside Out embodies Pixar at its best hitting on different levels for every age and as the kids might say causing all the feels by making them a Joy to behold. 127 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1MPCVGJ,http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/06/18/inside-out-movie-review/28872569/,200,insideout13,insideout,usatoday

(Whither Envy? Hate? Desire? Best not to ask; most of the films explorations occur inside the head of relatively undamaged tween girl Riley and the aforementioned five seem to have things well in hand.) Not that Joy is always joyful or Anger always angry; just that they each take the controls at the appropriate time. But what plucky ringleader Joy (an untrammeled Amy Poehler) doesnt get is why youd ever want Sadness at the helm -- especially when it comes to the formation of core memories the kind that shape our personalities. So when the family moves from Rileys home in Minnesota to the wilds of San Francisco Joy kicks into overdrive and tries to put a lockdown on Sadness who seems to be going haywire. When disaster ensues Joy and Sadness wind up on a journey through Rileys headspace trying to sort things out before its too late. Its not unusual for a film about childhood loss to be this funny while it sets about the work of making you cry; it is unusual for it to be this much fun. 2015. -- Matthew Lickona This movie is not currently in theaters.

Handout/TNS Nancy Churnin The Dallas Morning News nchurnin nchurnindallasnews.com Brilliantly inventive Inside Out takes a rollicking romp through a childas emotions (A) Jun. 18 2015 1224pm Close Sharing really is caring... Close Join the conversation... On Facebook With Nancy Churnin Comment on one of our official threads. Share This Story Share Discuss Meh If all that Inside Out had going for it was casting the explosive Lewis Black as the voice of bright red Anger with his head bursting into flames when he discovers theres no dessert it would have been enough for us.But this film which marks Disney-Pixars 20th astounding year has so much more you wonder how these virtuosos of animation will top themselves.Most of the action takes place inside the mind of Riley (Kaitlyn Dias) where the leader of her five key emotions Joy (a cheery Amy Poehler) is determined to keep Riley happy. In addition to Anger the team features Fear (a nervous Bill Hader) who helps her avert danger; Disgust (a disdainful Mindy Kaling) who helps her sidestep social faux pas - and broccoli; and Sadness (a lugubrious Phyllis Smith) who is pushed aside so she doesnt cause too many problems.Everything goes out of whack when Riley turns 11 and her parents uproot her from their home in Minneapolis for San Francisco where she has to start a new school and make new friends. While Joy tries to keep Riley cheery Sadness touches Rileys memories which look like the Harry Potter globes stacked on shelves in the Hall of Prophecies. Sadness hands turn the luminous white orbs an ominous blue. Joy tries to save Rileys memories and Joy Sadness and the memories end up being swept through a suction tube into the far reaches of Rileys mind.Thats when Inside Out transitions into an inspiring buddy movie. Joy and Sadness may be opposites but just as they learn that they need each other during their tough slog back to headquarters they trot out a brave idea for both parents and kids Its not only OK to be sad its imperative to embrace and share that feeling with those you love and trust. A scene from ""Inside Out."" Handout/TNS Director Pete Docter who dared to be scary in the Academy Award-nominated Monsters Inc. and delve into the pain of loss in the Academy Award winner Up once again shows an uncanny ability to enlighten as he entertains. This brilliantly inventive romp through the brain includes a sound stage where dreams are produced and abstract thought where these 3-D characters flatten into 2-D elongate and if they dont hurry can disappear.Tension mounts as Joy tumbles into the cavernous junkyard of long-term memory and desperately seeks a way to return Sadness and the memories back to Riley before she becomes so disconnected that she takes an action that could harm her.Buddy films have always been about balancing opposite urges. Here the balance mirrors not only whats needed for great art but also for mental and spiritual healing.Be sure to stick around after the main story resolves to see additional emotional control panels for a couple of four-legged friends. INSIDE OUT (A)Directed by Pete Docter co-directed by Ronnie del Carmen. PG (for mild thematic elements and some action). 94 mins. In wide release. LAVAAs if a movie about the inside of a childs mind werent sufficiently challenging the film is preceded by Lava a tender animated short about singing volcanoes in love.Set to a song written by its director James Ford Murphy it features the voices of Kuana Torres Kahele as a yearning volcano and Napua Greig as the one that responds to his call. It may take her millions of years but when you find the right one the tale suggests time flies - in this case in seven minutes. Goes Well With...

""Inside Out"" takes a more direct approach. This astonishing animated feature from Pixar uses the feelings themselves as comic characters in the tale of Riley an 11-year-old girl going through the emotional upheaval of moving with her parents from the sweet security of her childhood home in Minnesota to an unknowable fate in San Francisco. From one moment to the next five conflicting emotions--Joy Sadness Anger Fear and Disgust--do what they can to dominate Rileys inner life. As the action played out my own feelings ranged...

Disney Pixar photo Bing Bong (part cat part elephant but mostly cotton candy) is Rileys forgotten imaginary friend in Disney Pixars ""Inside Out."" (Pixar photo) Child-free adults may dismiss animated movies as kid stuff. The potential charm might not hold up when balanced with the idea of a theater full of sticky urchins bouncing around and screeching.But the best animated movies are made as much for the grown-ups who will accompany the children as for the kids themselves. Thats certainly true of ""Inside Out"" Pete Docters touching often thrilling Disney Pixar exploration of the emotions that make human beings human.An adorable 11-year-old girl named Riley (voiced by Kaitlin Dias) is as happy as kids get living in Minnesota with her loving parents (Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan) playing hockey and hanging out with good friends. Meanwhile inside her head her emotions keep her world in balance. Theres Joy (Amy Poehler) the leader and Sadness (Phyllis Smith) who counterbalances Joys perpetual perkiness (and vice versa); plus Fear (Bill Hader) Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Anger (Lewis Black). Together they run the control board that makes Riley Riley.Then things change. Dad moves the family to San Francisco (a bleak depressing San Francisco) to run a tech startup. The move is risky the house isnt ready and the only available pizza topping is broccoli. (""Congratulations San Francisco"" growls Anger. ""Youve ruined pizza."")The familiar rug pulled out from under her Riley is sad and homesick but unable to share those feelings with her parents who are also struggling. The change upends her emotional balance and it also upsets the balance in her control center.This results (not to give too much away) in Joy and Sadness on a joint mission to put Rileys emotional world back together. This is legitimately exciting as the ""core memories"" were told everyone has each a colorful island are put in jeopardy.Theres plenty of excitement and quite a few anxious moments as Joy and Sadness learn they have to work together to get back to their base before its too late.Along the way they meet my favorite character Bing Bong (Richard Kind) Rileys now-forgotten imaginary friend. (Hes ""mostly cotton candy"" but also part cat and part elephant with the squeal of a dolphin.) We also ride the ""train of thought"" passing such landmarks as ""deja vu"" then later ""deja vu."" Bits like that will keep less-childlike adults engaged even when the pacing seems to drag.In the end children will enjoy ""Inside Out"" for the fun colors (each emotion is conveniently color-coded) and entertaining adventure and will end the movie cheering. Grown-ups are more likely to watch with their own emotions on their sleeves and wind up sniffling.Rileys move to a new home is a metaphor for everyones inevitable move out of childhood when a sweet kid becomes someone different seemingly overnight. There too emotions get out of control and neither the pubescent tween nor the parent may know how to manage them. Its easy to imagine ""Inside Out"" being a talking point with preteens about just that while parents and younger children could use the movie to discuss emotions and how to deal with them. (It should come as no surprise that a pair of 5-year-olds were most taken with red-faced Anger.)One thing viewers of all ages will surely agree on though. Wed all love to have our own Bing Bong and not just because when he cries he cries candy.By the way be sure to sit through the closing credits which look at the control centers of other minds. A peek into the mind of a cat is worth the price of admission.What ""Inside Out""  Three stars out of four  Run time 142  Rating PG  Content Intense emotions and mildly frightening situations including a scary clown Gail Pennington  314-340-8136TV criticgailpennington on Twittergpenningtonpost-dispatch.com St. Louis Phyllis Smith is happy to be Sadness in Inside Out She teams up with Amy Poehlers Joy in Disney Pixar exploration of emotions.

Jones The Bleader Film June 17 2015 Movies | Movie Review Tweet Pin It Reprints Share Inside Out soon to be a major emotion picture In the latest Pixar animation the mind of an 11-year-old girl becomes the stage for a great adventure. By Ben Sachs 1bsachs Inside Out  Directed by Peter Docter and Ronaldo Del Carmen Inside Out the latest Disney-Pixar coproduction feels like a clever educational short stretched to feature length. It has plenty to teach viewers about the workings of the human mind (writers Josh Cooley Meg LeFauve and Pete Docter reportedly spent years researching the subject) and it employs an array of imaginative strategies to make those lessons palatable to a wide audience. Most of the film takes place inside the brain of Riley an 11-year-old girl; the principal characters are anthropomorphized versions of the five emotional states that govern her personality--joy sadness anger fear and disgust. The story takes place over a few weeks after Riley and her parents move from Minnesota to San Francisco focusing on how the emotions respond to various stressors associated with this big change. That challenge turns into a full-fledged adventure when some of Rileys ""core memories"" are misplaced during an anxious episode and Joy and Sadness must journey through the brain to recover them. Rileys mind looks a bit like Disneyland with components of her identity--her imagination her sense of familial belonging--represented by different islands which in turn are connected by a literal train of thought. The tower where the five main characters work suggests a NASA mission control center the emotions using complicated gadgets to process Rileys memories and determine her reactions to various stimuli. Realized in meticulous detail these mental landscapes convey an infectious fascination with the complexity of the brain; they also reflect a vaguely antihumanist sensibility that regards people as giant machines. The mix of childlike wonder and cold rationalism is characteristic of Pixar whose movies (WALL-E Brave) can feel so enamored of their own technological sophistication as to detract from their warmer more winning qualities. Inside Out is especially poignant in its handling of Sadness characterized as a neer-do-well who wants to be part of the emotional team but keeps making mistakes. (One clever detail is that Sadness turns any memory she touches permanently blue.) Joys uneasy partnership with this unwanted emotion makes for an effective metaphor about growing up. As any child matures she must learn to accept sadness as part of life; so Sadness becomes more important to the story as Riley comes of age even performing a crucial role at the movies climax. Unfortunately that climax is so loud and busy like that of any recent superhero movie that its off-putting; once again the Pixar team are too distracted by their gadgets to think about people.  v Trailer More Movie Review >> Tags Movie Review Inside Out Peter Docter Ronaldo Del Carmen Disney Studios Pixar Josh Cooley Meg LeFauve Pete Docter WALL-E Brave Video Email Share Digg Newsvine del.icio.us Facebook Reddit Twitter Windy Citizen Add to favorites Saving...

"Inside Out (PG) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Inside Out (PG) All the feels play a role in Pixars latest film which goes inside the mind of an 11-year-old girl. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com6/18/2015 Editor rating 3 Weve all heard them at some point or another those voices inside our head telling us what to do or how to feel. One of the big revelations in Inside Out the 15th (and most daring) feature film from Pixar Animation Studios is that those voices have bodies and heads. Theyre called emotions and they have simple self-explanatory names Joy (voiced by Amy Poehler) Sadness (Phyllis Smith) Fear (Bill Hader) Anger (Lewis Black) and Disgust (Mindy Kaling). Yes youve met them before in your life most of them at least once every day. But director Pete Docter (Up) who spent five years developing this wildly ambitious picture and also co-wrote the script does more than tell you what you already know. Inside Out visualizes abstract things -- memories instincts feelings -- in a riot of colors and shapes and objects that isnt only visually dazzling but also intellectually stimulating. Here is an English-language animated film influenced as much by Luis Bunuel and Carl Jung as Walt Disney. Co-directed by Ronnie Del Carmen Inside Out takes place primarily inside the head of 11-year-old Riley who moves with her parents from Minnesota to San Francisco and falls into a bit of a funk not necessarily because she misses her friends or her school but because Sadness touched one of the large marbles that form her ""core memory"" turning it from bright orange (happy) to sad (blue). Whats worse a chain reaction ensues that starts to destroy the girls ""Islands of Identity"" -- friendship family goofball -- and as each one crumbles her depression worsens. This might sound awfully serious but the wonder of Inside Out is how it turns what should be an unfilmable concept into a Pixar-style adventure replete with everything the brand name implies. Almost every scene contains at least two simultaneous gags one visual the other verbal (has there ever been another cartoon aimed at children that contained a shout-out to Chinatown?) Casting was particularly critical to Inside Out because the voices of the actors needed to embody the emotions of their respective characters. Poehler and Smith (who played Phyllis on TVs The Office) get the bulk of screen time and although Poehlers sing-song Joy runs the show inside Rileys head Smiths droopy vocal inflections almost steal the movie. Yes Sadness is a drag. But shes adorable too. As Fear Anger and Disgust Hader Black and Kaling have less to do because much as in real life those emotions arent as primal or active. But everyone gets at least one big moment (Kaling kills Rileys first encounter with broccoli pizza) and when the film starts to zoom inside the minds of other characters such as Rileys parents the whoa-factor is quadrupled. Every conceivable facet of this outlandish idea has been carefully considered and thought out and you watch the movie tingling with admiration at the depth of the films creativity and imagination. If Inside Out doesnt stack up with the best Pixar movies (Wall-E Finding Nemo Toy Story) thats because theres less plot here than usual and even at a lean 95 minutes the movie starts to drag before it ends. The consequences of whats happening inside Rileys head arent strong enough; the stakes are too thin. Intellectually the film is a jawdropper but ironically for a story about emotions the picture is curiously distant. There are no big lessons to be learned in Inside Out no morals to the fable just an outpouring of artistry of an exceedingly high caliber and a keen understanding of human nature. And although youre not left craving more the end credits which contain some of the best bits in the entire film prove just how stuffed with ideas Inside Out is. Kids will be engaged but its the older viewers -- people who have lived and felt a little longer than 11-year-olds -- who will most appreciate this marvelous ingenious work of art.

Or even more to the point films whose real audience is children who are all grown up children possessed of consumption power whether or not they have literal offspring of their own. This represented the contemporary evolution of an old idea Going back to Walt Disney and the invention of the ""family movie"" and before that deep into childrens literature there always had to be a handful of jokes calculated to sail over the heads of the tots and just enough sophistication to rope in wayward adult emotions.But theres an enormous conceptual gulf between Disney films of the ""classic"" mode from ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" and ""Dumbo"" right through ""Pocahontas"" and ""The Little Mermaid"" and the consistently elegiac and nostalgic childhoods-end fables of the Pixar era. If youve ever wondered why Pixars animators have never gotten around to adapting ""The Velveteen Rabbit"" Margery Williams 1922 classic about the boundary between childhood imagination and adult reality its because they dont have to. Almost every Pixar film is ""The Velveteen Rabbit"" transmuted into some new fictional universe but built upon the same question perhaps the most profound and tragic ever framed in the English language ""Of what use was it to be loved and lose ones beauty and become Real if it all ended like this?""Before following this thread too much farther down what could be a long and winding detour lets skip ahead to ""Inside Out"" the much-ballyhooed new Pixar film from Pete Docter who has written and/or directed several of the studios previous hits including ""Up"" ""Monsters Inc."" and the first two ""Toy Story"" movies. Its a thoroughly charming fable with at least some scientific grounding in brain research and our partial understanding of how personality is formed set both inside and outside the brain of an 11-year-old girl. Possibly it was overhyped by Cannes critics who simply got sick of wallowing in adult-grade misery. Were not talking about the greatest dramatic exploration of human adolescence since ""The 400 Blows"" or anything. As for the long-standing Pixar problem of how to represent human beings in digital form while avoiding the rubber-zombie ""Polar Express"" nightmare effect - well we may have gotten more used to it but it hasnt been solved.If ""Inside Out"" is unmistakably another ""Velveteen Rabbit"" story and one conspicuously calculated to reduce adults to tears - as when the girls childhood imaginary friend is discovered banished but not quite forgotten deep in the twisting corridors of Long-Term Memory - its also a work of nifty craftsmanship and considerable complexity beneath its unassuming surface. In the films outermost layer the ""real world"" Riley (voiced by Kaitlyn Dias) is a tomboyish only child a happy-go-lucky hockey player whose parents have just uprooted her from Minnesota and moved to San Francisco. We spend most of our time however within the capacious realm of Rileys brain where the perky and universally beloved emotion known as Joy (voiced by Amy Poehler) has long held sway over a team that also includes blue-hued Sadness (Phyllis Smith) twitchy bow-tied Fear (Bill Hader) crimson cubical Anger (Lewis Black) and verdant ultra-feminine Disgust (Mindy Kaling).Docter has said that ""Inside Out"" (which is co-written and co-directed by longtime Pixar animator Ronnie del Carmen) was inspired by watching his own daughter grow up and by relationships within his own family. That simplicity may limit the films audience to some extent Riley is unmistakably a child of the white American middle class and if her parents can afford a house in San Francisco (no matter how unprepossessing she finds it) then by any reasonable standard they are loaded. But the specific character of Docters story has a real resonance and one of the films most powerful subtexts is the suggestion that Rileys parents (voiced by Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan) are emotionally dependent on her. Without quite realizing it they rely on Riley to be the ""happy girl"" who is carefree and resilient no matter what; they havent noticed either that she is changing or that the cross-country move has shaken her sense of herself and her place in the world. You Might Also Like Mom and Dad are no better than supporting players the Rosencrantz and Guildenstern of Rileys internal drama. Cut off from the brains control room by a series of traumas Joy and Sadness must wander through the back hallways and storage rooms of Rileys mind trying to figure out what is happening to all the seemingly permanent structures of childhood. Aided by Bing Bong (Richard Kind) the aquatic broom-tailed purple elephant who was once Rileys constant companion they visit the Land of Imagination the Realm of Abstract Thought and even the Subconscious there to awaken a truly terrifying birthday clown worthy of Stephen King. (A word to parents of young children prone to nightmares The word is no.)This is all sweet sad and lovingly constructed with dashes of wry Pixar humor The cynical pros at the TV studio where dreams are constructed the dull-witted security guards at the gates of the Subconscious the chewing-gum commercial that will not go away even as precious childhood memories are literally vacuumed into oblivion. I have to say though as the parent of an actual American 11-year-old girl Wow do Rileys parents have it easy Shes sad about moving away from all her friends and the place she grow up she has a minor tantrum and threatens to quit hockey and theres another entirely predictable and not all that convincing plot twist after that. The looming specter of puberty and relationships with boys are barely mentioned and the cutthroat competitive quality of friendships between girls never comes up at all. ""Inside Out"" marks another milestone (after ""Brave"") in Pixars quiet exploration of feminism; as a co-worker observed it takes nerve to make an entire film about a tween girls inner life instead of a universe of talking toys or anthropomorphized automobiles. Consciously or not I suspect Docter is also trying to balance out the audience dynamic and create a movie that might appeal to actual kids. During what might be called Pixars high-modernist period with ""Toy Story 3"" and ""WALL-E"" and ""Up"" it sometimes felt as if the grand parables about civilization were literally driving the little ones out of the theater. Children who did see those films may well have been puzzled by the dominant themes of regret and loss sin and forgiveness mortality (and even apocalypse) ambiguously redeemed. Was this supposed to be Saturday afternoon cinema for the whole family or a series of illustrated extracts from the Norton Anthology of Poetry?""Inside Out"" never has that feeling that its trying to encode a Holocaust discourse the paradoxical universe building of Philip K. Dick and St. Augustines ruminations on time into 90 minutes of animation. Its a lovely film that requires a little patience and a friendly disposition and may be too low-impact to thrive amid a summer of grotesquely overengineered sequels. Its actual audience I suspect consists of younger kids eager to protest or debate Bing Bongs exile to the gulag and grown-ups who long to recapture all the things in their own lives and their childrens that cannot be recaptured. It isnt a movie for real-world 11-year-olds who have quite enough on their plates without indulging the doleful Proustian fantasies of their parents. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

"Inside Out revives Pixar movie magic review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesInside Out revives Pixar movie magic reviewThe magnificent head trip that is Inside Out does more than take us inside a young girls mind. It also restores Pixars lost magic.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. June 18 2015Inside OutPixar animation featuring the voices of Kaitlyn Dias Amy Poehler Phyllis Smith Mindy Kaling Bill Hader Lewis Black Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan. Directed by Pete Docter. 102 minutes. Opens Friday at major theatres. GThe magnificent head trip that is Inside Out does more than take us inside a young girls mind. It also restores Pixars lost magic.Remember Toy Story WALL-E and The Incredibles where emotion and intellect were both served by tales of imagination and depth? These delightful films were from an era that seemed gone forever supplanted in recent years by franchise timewasters like Cars 2 and Monsters University.Article Continued BelowInside Out not only recalls the Pixar of old it may be the Disney partners finest achievement yet. Tipping its hat to The Wizard of Oz Fantastic Voyage and numerous other fantasy journeys this animated adventure thoroughly amuses and challenges on its subconscious quest. Amy Poehler is the voice of Joy in Inside Out.  (Pixar / Disney)  Joy and Sadness join forces on a trip through a young girls mind.  (Disney/Pixar)  Five primary human emotions become colourful cartoon characters voiced by gifted actors Joy (Amy Poehler) Sadness (Phyllis Smith) Fear (Bill Hader) Anger (Lewis Black) and Disgust (Mindy Kaling).RELATEDInside Outs Phyllis Smith is tickled pink to be blueArrayed behind the control panel of a cerebral Headquarters (groan) they jockey to control and safeguard the thoughts and memories of 11-year-old Riley (Kaitlyn Dias) a Minnesota girl who loves to play hockey and who generally allows Joy to guide her.Her father (Kyle MacLachlan) gets a new job in San Francisco uprooting him along with Riley and her mom (Diane Lane) to an unfamiliar city and sparsely furnished home. Riley falls prey to Sadness a moody blue sentiment who looks naive and harmless but who has a habit of sneaking up on people just as the blues do in real life. Soon a full-blown case of depression looms one that irrepressible Joy cant easily solve despite her cheery ""We can fix this"" mantra. Worse yet Rileys happy ""core memories"" -- represented by glowing golden spheres -- are in danger of being erased and supplanted with permanently terrible thoughts. Joy and Sadness are obliged to join forces and travel through the maze of Rileys mind in a bid to restore her equilibrium. Meanwhile Fear Anger and Disgust struggle to hold the fort back in Headquarters much to the concern and bafflement of Rileys parents. Dads own Headquarters perceives ""high levels of sass"" emanating from Riley. References to other films abound -- theres even a shout-out to the Minions of Despicable Me in the ""mind workers"" of Rileys neuronal housekeepers -- but Inside Out has a charm all its own.We meet figures of pure whimsy and wonder. These include Bing Bong (Richard Kind) an elephant/dolphin/cat hybrid clad in pink cotton candy who was Rileys imaginary friend from her early childhood.A giant clown called Jangles (Josh Cooley) rises out of Rileys subconscious. Is he comedy or drama? Joy and Sadness will have to use their noggins to figure it out.The movie really flips its lid as it depicts a sprint towards Rileys Train of Thought across multiple dimensions. Theres also a casting call inside Dream Productions a magic factory unlike any other where a rainbow unicorn acts as nocturnal diva.The jokes flash by at synaptic speed buoyed by an exuberant score from composer Michael Giacchino (Jurassic World Up Rataouille) and with shout-outs to such adult pleasures as the movies Vertigo and Chinatown. Some of the films concepts are hard to grasp immediately which isnt surprising considering director Pete Docter and producer Jonas Rivera who previously teamed for the Oscar-winning Up (2009) spent years consulting with psychologists about the myriad complexities of the human mind. (Docter also co-wrote the inventive screenplay along with Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley while Pixar veteran Ronnie Del Carmen gets credit for the original story and also as the films co-director.)Inside Out was years in the making with entire sections being tossed out and reworked as Docter and his team set about getting the right tone neither too comic nor too dramatic while allowing for the nuances that make emotions really interesting.The effort was worth it especially in finessing Sadness and Anger who would undoubtedly be unalloyed villains in a lesser film. Inside Out makes the essential point that all lives have unhappiness in them and that mental health requires balancing bad feelings with good ones.Sadness has mixed sensations about the havoc shes causing because she really doesnt want to hurt Riley.

Shari L. Gross Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Its no surprise for a Pixar film to touch our emotions. The visionary animation house avoids the usual usual producing kids entertainments that are non-juvenile. Comic fantasies such as ""Up"" and ""Ratatouille"" have subplots about maturing and saying goodbye that powerfully pluck the heartstrings. The studios complicated and fascinating 15th entry ""Inside Out"" doesnt do that. It plays your ticker like a Stradivarius. The genre-defying 3-D film co-written and directed by Oscar winner Pete Docter mood-swings between two stories on different levels. One follows the everyday life of Riley a normally cheerful 11-year-old who becomes sad and angry after moving with her parents from their home in Minnesota. The parallel story explores how her emotions respond to her challenges of life in San Francisco without old friends or familiar neighborhoods. Inside the control center of Rileys mind -- Headquarters -- theres a discordant squad akin to Snow Whites Seven Dwarfs. Joy (personified by Amy Poehler) is a daisy-yellow optimist who wants to keep every moment of Rileys life super-cheerful. Tear-shaped Sadness (Phyllis Smith) is a woebegone bluebell who understands the value of having a good cry -- even in front of the class at Rileys new school. Eye-rolling Disgust (Mindy Kaling) basically prevents Riley from getting poisoned. You know by broccoli. Anger (Louis Black) lets off steam helping her decompress after problems. Thats vital when the Headquarters newspaper the Mind Reader has unfair shock headlines such as ""NO DESSERT"" Fear (Bill Hader) is sort of a raw nerve protecting her from dangers such as bad dreams. The stakes rise when Joy and Sadness are snatched from their command center. Now theyre as lost as Riley traveling through strange regions of her head. Her core memories have created areas that are cornerstones of her personality gorgeous visual metaphors such as Family Island Friendship Island and Honesty Island. But those havens are decaying in emotional earthquakes. The unexpected move is disconnecting Rileys past and pushing her to a difficult new self-discovery. Old recollections tumble to their end falling in the abyss of the Memory Dump no matter how precious they once were. As Joy and Sadness try to ride Rileys locomotive Train of Thought back to their teammates we visit the confused instinctive quintets inside Mom and Dad showing that adult emotional growth can be as laughably flawed as a prepubescent girls. ""Inside Out"" is uplifting and magical impeccably crafted and cinematically arresting emotional and humorous beyond measure. It is also sad and bitter throwing viewers into the kind of agony Rileys emotions feel when she sucks up an iced Slurpee brain freeze. As they visit Rileys emotional states Joy and Sadness encounter stunningly inventive areas such as Imagination Land where Rileys thoughts about French fry forests and cloud hotels are built; Dream Productions where Rainbow Unicorn a diva starlet makes dreams into overnight movies and Abstract Thought where they transform into ugly silly strange beautiful surrealist objects. And they havent even entered Rileys Subconscious yet. At moments such as this ""Inside Out"" echoes surrealism. It isnt realist -- its much better than realist. Pixar Mom (Diane Lane) Riley (Kaitlyn Dias) and Dad (Kyle MacLachlan). The films peak of intensity comes when the mismatched partners meet Bing Bong (voiced by Richard Kind) the imaginary childhood friend Riley has almost entirely forgotten. Hes a lovable soul an elephant-trunked cotton candy beehive who carries a rucksack of important recollections and puzzles about why his dear pal never visits anymore. And hes on the way to a climax that would fit a mournful Edgar Allan Poe tale. Pixars time-honored fascination with themes of disuse and oblivion has never made a more touching creature. Like the ""Toy Story"" trilogy ""Inside Out"" is about loss and the passage of time. Its a gentle depiction of the things well lose when we grow up. It poignantly depicts the idea that every party has to end expanding the emotional range of childrens films along with a healthy dose of laughter. After the traditional Pixar end credits list which salutes the many Production Babies born as ""Inside Out"" inched through the pipeline it ends with a poetic farewell message ""This film is dedicated to our kids. Please dont grow up. Ever."" ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

It defies the conventions of family movies The most profound--as well as profoundly good--Pixar movies are the ones that seem the least plausible as story pitches. Consider Up (crushed by encroaching development old man flies away with his house) and WALL-E (environmental wasteland nice robot). Now theres Inside Out which defies the conventions of family movies by being an animated comedy about brain chemistry and situational depression. That makes it perhaps the craziest movie Pixar has ever come up with. Imagine Fellini using animation to create a narrative starring the limbic system with diversions to the subconscious (""where they take all the troublemakers"") treacherous trips into abstract thinking and rides on the highly erratically scheduled train of thought. From a story hatched by co-directors Peter Docter (Up Monsters Inc.) and Ronaldo del Carmen Inside Out is nearly hallucinogenic entirely beautiful and easily the animation studios best release since 2010s Toy Story 3. Stylistically Inside Out is nothing like Richard Linklaters Boyhood but for its scope in examining the maturation process it might well be called Childhood. The central human character is an 11 year-old only child named Riley Anderson (voiced by Kaityn Dias) who loves hockey and her parents but the story is mainly told from the perspective of five core human emotions. Joy sadness anger fear and disgust are all depicted as characters that live within Riley. (Usually scientists go with happy when theyre talking about emotions but Joy makes a better name for anyone voiced by Amy Poehler. Talk about type-casting; you wonder if the movie was built around her Parks and Recreation persona). These five characters move in and out of control of the central keyboard of Rileys brain until a crisis is set in motion by the Anderson familys relocation from Minnesota to San Francisco. While the movers dawdle and Dads ""investors"" jerk his startup chain the Andersons live in an empty narrow dirty house. (Even the perkiest real estate agent would stretch to call this a Victorian but in the nations hottest real estate market it probably cost at least 1.5 million.) No wonder Riley has trouble summoning her joy especially facing a new school. Sadness (the wonderful Phyllis Smith from The Office) blue-skinned and bound up in a tight turtleneck sweater keeps touching and thus sullying all the old good memories; soon Anger (Lewis Black) moves into the drivers seat with Fear (Bill Hader) hovering near by and Disgust (Mindy Kahling) snarking from the other side. Riley plunges into a depression and the movie becomes a race against time as her good memories crumble and misery closes in. In the Pixar vision of depression Joy and Rileys imaginary friend from her earliest years Bing Bong (Richard Kind) are reduced to tiny pinpoints bright lights in sea of coal-colored thoughts and memories. They have to literally climb over the misery to get out. The brain itself has components that look like a giant gumball machine. Rileys various islands of personality (friends family hockey) could be the kind of alien outpost where Han Solo has drinks. There is an abyss naturally but overall this is a place of little order and great mystery which you might not expect from Pixar given its propensity for explaining away say the sources of scary dreams (Monsters Inc.). To be lost in its bowels is terrifying even for perky Joy. One of the movies best gags is the snoring red-nosed hulk hidden away in the subconscious. To see the complexity of the human brain laid out in animation right down to arching pathways of light that look a lot like synapses is mind-blowing in the same way Fantasia is mind-blowing. But what makes the movie so rich and enlightening even for an adult well acquainted with their own blue periods is the depiction of emotions not as at war with each other but rather in a constant juggling act to keep their human going. Rileys mother and father voiced by Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan have their own five-character emotion parade. It is true that Rileys Disgust eggs on Anger and that Joy a bossy hedonist would rather Sadness stay within the chalk circle she draws for her. But the emotions are all in this together in support of Riley. One of Inside Outs great triumphs is Joys dawning realization about the need for balance and the gifts that unmasked Sadness can bring including the support of ones loved ones. Sadness is of course particularly well suited to movie theaters which are great places to cry. (As Joy urges Sadness to get out of her funk she keeps reminding her of ""that funny movie where the dog died""). Which brings me to a sidenote For four years I shared a movie beat with TIMEs legendary critic Richard Corliss who died in April. Richard could be territorial. A Pixar movie was a bone he never wanted to give up (unless well...Cars 2). For me Inside Out was tinged with sadness that he is no longer here to see it. What would he have loved best? The sly joke that Anger is the designated newspaper reader in the group? (Choice headline ""Replaced No Friends for Riley"") Or the way Rileys memory service team clears out all her piano lessons except for ""Chopsticks"" and ""Heart and Soul?"" Or perhaps the wistful lyrical pas de deux when Joy dances to one of Rileys favorite memories of skating on a frozen Minnesota lake? Yes to all of them the sorrow and the joy.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Ann Hornaday June 18 2015 Follow AnnHornaday After the premiere of ""Up"" at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival Pixar chief John Lasseter explained the studios nearly foolproof approach to creating animated stories that both enchant and endure Whenever possible he said he and his colleagues strive to fulfill Walt Disneys motto ""For every smile a tear."" That dictum is not just obeyed but refined to throat-catching perfection in ""Inside Out"" a triumphant return to form for the studio best known for such classics as ""Toy Story"" ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Wall-E."" As vivacious as it is thoughtful as funny as it is wise and as warmly accessible as it is dizzyingly complex this raucous journey through the inner life of an 11-year-old girl fires on every artistic cylinder from its vivid visuals to its uncannily sophisticated grasp of brain science. If there were any justice in an entertainment culture currently dominated by lumbering dinosaurs and their dimwitted human handlers the dumbed-down noise of summer would be decisively muted by the far more powerful moods thoughts and ideas that give ""Inside Out"" not just its verve and spirit but also its soberingly high stakes. [The 2015 Summer Movie Guide Dinosaurs superheroes and so much more] And we havent even gotten to Bing Bong. But that comes later. From the start ""Inside Out"" centers on Riley (voiced by Kaitlyn Dias) a happy-go-lucky girl growing up in cozy bliss with her loving parents in Minnesota. From the moment of her arrival Riley has a secret companion dwelling deep inside her brain Joy her cardinal emotion personified as a twirling blue-haired pixie and voiced by Amy Poehler. Assuming chief-pilot position behind a blinking dashboard its Joy who largely controls Rileys feelings even when Anger (Lewis Black) Fear (Bill Hader) Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith) come into the mix. Happiness is Rileys default setting and her mostly positive vibes and memories have allowed her to construct a personality composed of different but complementary islands including Family Friendship Honesty and -- because she is one -- Goofball. 1 of 62 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad x Four-star movies View Photos Keep tabs on the films that received top honors from Post critics over the last year.

Ann Hornaday writes ""...Captain Fantastic leaves viewers with the cheering deeply affecting image of a dad whose superpowers lie in simply doing the best that he can."" Read the full review. Cathy Kanavy/Bleecker Street Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Everythings humming along -- Riley is living the life of well Riley -- when things begin going a bit wonky starting with her familys move to San Francisco and exacerbated by a dreary new house difficulties making friends and pressure to keep up a tirelessly cheerful face for her parents (Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan). A couple of hiccups occur up in ""headquarters"" where core memories are formed and processed into translucent orbs traveling along a wavy Skee-Ball course -- or if you will an emotional roller coaster. When Joy and Sadness spelunk into Rileys deeper consciousness to sort it out the negative feelings threaten to take over sending her into a funk of depression loneliness and alienation. Poehler brings her signature irrepressibility and motormouth charm to her performance as Joy who despite working for Riley is really the star of ""Inside Out."" Smith best known as Phyllis from the sitcom ""The Office"" brings similar texture to bear on her blue teardrop-shaped sad sack who droops and drags herself through Rileys brain like an inner Debbie Downer. Directed by Pete Docter and Ronnie Del Carmen from a script by Meg LeFauve Josh Cooley and Docter ""Inside Out"" derives most of its comic relief from Blacks explosive portrayal of Anger a boxy easily enraged hothead. ""Congratulations San Francisco"" he fumes when Riley recoils from a broccoli-topped pie at a local Italian deli ""you just ruined pizza."" As fabulous as the vocal performances are in ""Inside Out"" its the clever writing and lush visuals that catapult it to greatness from how ingeniously the filmmakers illustrate the inner workings of the human mind to amusingly on-point glimpses into the emotional HQs of Rileys parents. (Pro tip Stay all the way to the end for a hilarious end-credits sequence.) Among ""Inside Outs"" most impressive set pieces on Joy and Sadnesss journey through the mazelike expanse of Rileys mind are a visit to abstract thought (in which they go from three to two dimensions finally ending up as nonrepresentational squiggles) and a stop at the dream factory. The latter is depicted as a bustling Hollywood back lot where a rainbow-maned unicorn waits for her cue and a scary clown lurks far below in Rileys subconscious where as Sadness puts it ""they take all the troublemakers."" Dodging vacuum-wielding ""Forgetters"" on the lookout for old telephone numbers and other useless facts Joy and Sadness see the aforementioned Bing Bong an imaginary friend from Rileys toddler days who is part elephant part cat part dolphin and mostly cotton candy. Voiced with bittersweet sensitivity by Richard Kind Bing Bong winds up playing a crucial role not only in Rileys putting away childish things but also in nudging Joy and Sadness toward getting along. Itll be no surprise if ""Inside Out"" becomes as beloved as ""Toy Story"" and ""Finding Nemo"" if only for its liberated wildly inventive sense of wonder and breathless breakneck pace. But this is that rare movie that transcends its role as pure entertainment to become something genuinely cathartic even therapeutic giving children a symbolic language with which to manage their unruliest emotions. Uncle Walt knew what he was talking about with ""For every smile a tear."" With ""Inside Out"" the brilliant keepers of his legacy prove that its not only good for business but also essential for the soul. PG. At area theaters.

By Maricar Estrellamestrellamom2momdfw.comPosted 402pm on Thursday Jun. 18 2015 Thursday Jun. 18 2015 Thursday Jun. 18 2015 By Maricar Estrella What were you thinking?This familiar perplexed parental refrain punctuated with ""inside voice"" expletives if the offense is really bad is the core concept behind the refreshingly imaginative new animated film Inside Out.The story dives deep into the mind of 11-year-old Riley (voiced by Kaitlyn Dias). Inside her headquarters live five emotions led by rah-rah cheerleader Joy ( Amy Poehler) whose optimistic outlook is the crux of Rileys formative years from infant to present time. Rileys emotional team is rounded out by Fear ( Bill Hader) who keeps her out of danger; Anger ( Lewis Black) who ensures lifes imperfections turn out fair for her; Disgust (Mindy Kaling) whose high-minded opinions keep her from being a social outcast; and Sadness ( Phyllis Smith) who has a difficult time understanding her role in Rileys life and just wants to cry it out. Lets just say the casting alone is hilariously on-point especially Smiths Sadness. Like an exceptional Eeyore Sadness is the perfect complement to Joy and a nice rendition of prepubescent angst.The control center of emotions goes into crisis mode when Rileys family must make a difficult transition -- a relocation. Coincidentally or not headquarters loses Joy and Sadness. Without their natural-born leaders Anger Disgust and Fear form a tantrum triumvirate to navigate Riley through the first days of a new city new school and new life. The Disney-Pixar creators do a wonderful job of visualizing the inner turmoil of a child and the frantic concern of parents. At the family dinner table Rileys mom ( Diane Lane) innocently asks ""So how was the first day of school?"" To which Riley responds ""It was fine I guess. I dont know.""The simple family exchange between Mom Dad ( Kyle MacLachlan) and Riley turns into a fascinating comedic look at what goes on in peoples heads. The scene builds to an unexpected outcome for the audience myriad mixed emotions.Directors Pete Docter ( Monsters Inc .; Up) and Ronnie del Carmen ( Dugs Special Mission) have created a masterful study of family dynamics. Like the Oscar-winning Up Inside Out takes great care in weaving complex ideas into a childrens tale. Some scenes such as the journey into Long Term Memory Imagination Land and Abstract Thought might go over the heads of the younger set but I challenge any parent who watches this film to not be moved by its heartfelt message. As always Pixar delivers the stunning animation that is made more vivid in 3-D.Get to the theater early so you dont miss the lovely animated short Lava a sweet intoxicating musical love story. If you have to choose just one family film to see this summer your inside voices should be saying See Inside Out.undefined on Disney Video Maricar Estrella 817-390-7720 Twitter maricare Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

And thats because theyre - literally -- in control of her. Dont believe me? Watch the terrifically inventive new Pixar cartoon ""Inside Out"" as it takes us inside the head of that tween and shows us whats really pushing her buttons - a five-mood team of Joy Anger Disgust Fear and Sadness. Its a bright sunny day? Joy grabs the controls. Except its the day Rileys moving out of her old neighborhood and away from our best friend? Time for Sadness to take the wheel. And wait what - starting a new school tomorrow? Move over - Fears driving this time. Its a wonderfully wild surreally offbeat idea for a childrens cartoon - a little bit Sigmund Freud a lot of ""The 5000 Fingers of Dr. T."" - and no matter how many hundreds of artists had a hand in it you have to give a huge amount of credit to lead director Pete Docter. Its not that the Pixar crew havent turned out great cartoons (mostly - Im never going to be a ""Cars"" fan). But Docter has always gone for the unique. ""Up"" with its fantastic love-through-the-ages montage - that was one of his. ""WALL-E"" with its long wordless opening was from his script. And not only did those cartoons take huge risks they delivered huge emotions. Like them ""Inside Out"" coaxes out plenty of laughs and tears often in surprising moments as it tells the story of Rileys unhappy journey from the heaven of a home in rural Minnesota to the hell of a townhouse in San Francisco. (Hey shes a kid what does she know?) Its a heady emotional time - disrupted even more by a mechanical failure back at her brains emotional headquarters. So Joy and Sadness have to set out on a journey to try and set things right - a trek that will take them through the scary territories of Dreams Imagination the Subconscious and that great grey hole where memories go to fade. It may sound a little like a Psychology 101 lecture as delivered by Salvador Dali but Docter and co-director Ronaldo Del Carmen keep things moving with smart subtle jokes and a good crew of voice actors particularly Amy Poehler as the perennially sunny Joy and Phyllis Smith as wimpy weepy Sadness. Most perfectly cast? Lewis Black as Anger of course. Most surprisingly touching? Richard Kind who plays one of Rileys forgotten imaginary friends Bing Bong a fuzzy elephant/kitty/dolphin hybrid who looks like he got kicked off the Island of Misfit Toys. The fact that Bing Bong is a forgotten imaginary friend is the point too. Like the ""Toy Story"" movies (two of which Docter also wrote) ""Inside Out"" is about the passing of childhood ritual its most bittersweet moments the ones glimpsed in a rear-view mirror as it reminds the unfaithful Remember when you loved that? When you lived for this? Until you didnt anymore? By the way a general parental warning about this movie Prepare now for your childs tears about an hour in. Also your own. Theres a happy ending but like Docters other films it makes you work for it. All in all ""Inside Out"" doesnt dare quite as much artistically as ""Up"" and ""WALL-E"" did. It falls back on a couple of cliches (including sadly the old Clueless Dad one). It stints a bit on character design - Fear doesnt really look finished and Disgust is basically Joy with false eyelashes and a green spraytan. (And although this isnt Docters fault the short that precedes his movie - ""Lava"" - is a snooze.) But those are quibbles - the kind of minor annoyances that would send Anger screaming and Sadness into a funk but Joy would know quite properly to ignore. Because really ""Inside Out"" is her movie. And if youre smart youll make it yours too. Inside Out (PG) Disney (94 min.) Directed by Pete Docter Ronaldo Del Carmen. With the voices of Amy Poehler Lewis Black.

Metaphors lurk around every turn intellectual concepts come easily into play and the film glides through wild imaginative constructs as if theyre everyday carnival rides. This isnt a trip down the rabbit hole with Alice this is a trip to the land behind your eyes. And that land is amazing enlightening and consistently hilarious.Most of the credit has to go to director and co-writer Pete Docter who has already given us the Pixar wonders ""Up"" ""Monsters Inc."" and ""Wall-E."" Its impossible to say ""Inside Out"" is his greatest achievement -- those are some pretty great achievements -- but believe it or not its by far his most daring.The movie takes place for the most part inside the head of Riley (Kaitlyn Dias) an 11-year-old girl whos just moved from Minnesota to San Francisco. Since birth Rileys been driven by the five emotions/attitudes in her control room Joy (Amy Poehler and its mostly her movie) Sadness (Phyllis Smith) Fear (Bill Hader) Anger (Lewis Black in full volcano mode) and Disgust (Mindy Kaling).At any given moment one of these characters can begin steering Riley but since shes generally had a good life Joy is mostly in charge. She oversees the protection of Rileys core memories (in the shape of bowling balls) and monitors the health of the mind-lands that her life has built up -- a land where family is cherished another for goofiness another for her love of hockey.But just as Riley is having to deal with the shock of moving to a new town making new friends adjusting to a new house Joy and Sadness get involved in a squabble that sends them -- and Rileys core memories -- off to the back of Rileys mind. Suddenly Fear Disgust and Anger -- not the most balanced trio -- are running the show as the young girl attends her first day of school tries out for a hockey team and inevitably blows up at her parents (Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan).Meanwhile the ever-upbeat Joy dragging the morose Sadness has to find her way through all sorts of parts of Rileys mind -- imagination abstract thought the scary subconscious -- back to the control room. Luckily they stumble on a fantastical guide named Bing Bong (Richard Kind) an elephant-cat-dolphin creature who was once Rileys imaginary friend but now wanders in the back alleys of her being.So while Anger Fear and Disgust are doing none too great a job of steering the young girl -- and with many of her most cherished constructs crumbling as a result of their ineptitude -- Joy and Sadness are negotiating all the ups and downs and ins and outs of the human psyche.If all this sounds confusing and somewhat overwhelming the wonder of ""Inside Out"" is that it makes perfect sense. And Docter keeps the humor-meter turned to 10 most of the time incorporating grumbling mind-workers and goofy jokes into the yarn at every opportunity.Small kids arent going to grasp the double entendres or psyche laughs but they will be mesmerized by the grand fantasy of it all as well as by the extremely essential characters. This is a movie anyone with a mind young or old can embrace.It may also be a movie that Hollywood can embrace. Its hard to believe that anyone will make a film more ambitious and more fully realized this year than ""Inside Out.""Let the talk of a best picture Oscar win begin now.tlongdetroitnews.comtwitter.com/toomuchTomLongInside OutGRADE A+Rated PG for mild thematic elements and some actionRunning time 94 minutes 8 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1LgBmEx MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/columnists/tom-long/2015/06/18/review-brilliant-inside-explores-girls-mind/28908849/,200,insideout27,insideout,detroitnews

EntertainmentMovies Inside Out Pixars latest is a real head trip Originally published June 18 2015 at 1205 am Updated June 22 2015 at 1036 am ""Inside Out"" takes place inside the head of an 11-year-old girl named Riley. Providing the voices for Rileys emotions are Phyllis Smith (Sadness) Bill Hader (Fear) Lewis Black (Anger) Mindy Kaling (Disgust) and Amy Poehler (Joy). (Pixar) A review of ""Inside Out"" a moving entertaining animated tour of an 11-year-olds mind voiced by Amy Poehler Mindy Kaling Bill Hader and others. Rating 4 stars out of 4. Share story By Moira Macdonald Seattle Times movie critic Dont tell your kids but the latest Pixar film ""Inside Out"" is really for adults. Its not that children wont love it with its balloon-bright colors silly voices and zippy action sequences but to fully appreciate its message you may need to be a former kid. Like ""Up"" -- also directed by the brilliant Pete Docter -- ""Inside Out"" movingly but casually plays with our emotions like a baby walking her fingers across a parents face; it leaves you changed entertained nostalgic dazzled. At heart this is an action film but one set inside a particularly fraught location the brain of an 11-year-old girl named Riley (voiced by Kaitlyn Dias) whos going through some life changes. With her parents (Diane Lane Kyle MacLachlan) shes moved from the Midwest to San Francisco where she struggles to find a toehold -- and where as preadolescence begins to take hold her personality becomes less happy-go-lucky and more moody. Sounds like an earnest ""Afterschool Special"" but ""Inside Out"" is anything but Most of it takes place literally inside Rileys mind (""Headquarters"") where five emotions -- Joy (Amy Poehler effervescent) Sadness (Phyllis Smith waterlogged) Fear (Bill Hader skittery) Disgust (Mindy Kaling sneering) and Anger (Lewis Black steaming) -- hilariously struggle for dominance. The story becomes a zoomy roller-coaster ride through Rileys consciousness as memories get misplaced trains of thought get derailed a Dream Studio (one that would rival any Hollywood company) is visited organization is attempted (""These facts and opinions look so similar"") and maintenance workers busily keep things tidy by disposing of things not worth keeping. Four years of piano lessons? ""Save Chopsticks and Heart amp; Soul forget the rest"" briskly advises a coveralld staffer. Movie Review    Inside Out with the voices of Amy Poehler Phyllis Smith Richard Kind Mindy Kaling Bill Hader Lewis Black Kaitlyn Dias Diane Lane Kyle MacLachlan. Directed by Pete Docter from a screenplay by Docter Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley. 106 minutes (includes Pixar short film ""Lava""). Rated PG for mild thematic elements and some action. Several theaters. The voices as with all Pixar films are marvelously chosen Poehlers Joy even as she feels her prominence fading is a sparkly gung-ho cheerleader of happiness; Smith (of ""The Office"") gives Sadness a funny downtrodden quality appropriate for someone who when pondering the groups course of action woefully offers ""We could cry until we cant breathe."" (Everything this character said cracked me up.) And the visuals are a rainbow-hued wonder from Disgusts glittery green eyelashes to the fantastical Islands of Personality (for Riley these include Hockey Island and Goofball Island) that look like distant alluring theme parks. (Mandatory 3D/2D note I saw this movie in 2D and cant imagine how 3D would have changed it much; I suspect its gorgeous regardless of dimensions.)

Along the way it brings more joy than any movie Ive seen this year along with a happy tear or two. Take a girl of any age to see this movie; it is like its bubbly central character a joy.

A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - The first time we cry as a newborn might be the purest emotion we ever feel. We sob -- a raw mess of tears and terror -- and a big human rushes to give comfort. Mentally the connection is made My feelings trigger a response be it hugs or milk or simply that I am heard. From then on were aware that our emotions affect our world and soon after that theyre something to be controlled whether by overruling fear or letting anger rip.Pixars Inside Out goes inside that control tower populated with five competing emotions and walls of whirligigs. When Riley (Kaitlyn Dias) is born her undeveloped infant brain is a void where one feeling Joy (Amy Poehler) a Tinkerbell knockoff oversees one button Smile. Thirty-three seconds later Riley weeps and a second feeling Sadness (Phyllis Smith) pads in to grab command. Fear (Bill Hader) Anger (Lewis Black) and Disgust (Mindy Kaling) enter next expanding Rileys emotional range with new gizmos and levers. Her first memories each the size of a bowling ball roll into the room on metal rails and then theyre pinballed into the shadows to light up new quadrants of Rileys mind and shape her sparkling personality. Its truly the game of life.Film Details Inside Out RatingPG GenreAnimation Running Time102 min. More Info Trailer Pete Docter and Ronnie Del Carmens overbright cartoon cant disguise that this is heady stuff -- a more natural fit for a black-and-white Bergman film than a kiddie caper. Adults spend years in therapy learning to parse their emotions. For children the inner world is an uncharted sea subject to storms -- a small gym-class slight can build into a swell of sorrow that like everyone in school totally hates them.Related Stories21 Best Things to Do in L.A. This WeekFilm Podcast Ted 2 and Inside OutJoy refuses to let Riley sink. For the first 11 years of Rileys life she helms the controls with a jolly fist. Joy banishes Sadness to a corner and dominates Fear Anger and Disgust with her cheerleader zeal. Fear is allowed to say caution Riley against falling. But Riley must be happy or else -- this is the at-all-costs ultra-American effervescence that showers children with gold stars.Were primed to resent Sadness a mope in a turtleneck and glasses who bumbles around the brain accidentally turning Rileys memories from sunny yellow to doleful blue. Yet Sadness doesnt enjoy making Riley miserable. By definition how could she? Sadness simply cant behave according to the rules Joy has established as lovely an explanation for depression as Ive ever seen.Inside Outs script co-written by Docter Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley gives Riley a reason to despair. Her parents (Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan) uproot her from Minnesota to San Francisco where she cant find friends play ice hockey settle into her bedroom or even munch pizza that isnt poisoned with broccoli. In her nightmares broadcast from a live studio set inside her mind slices of veggie pie screech ""Were organic"" Though Pixar is minutes from San Francisco the animators make their hometown look justifiably harsh even squeezing in an adults-only joke about the local ""bears."" Still what lingers is moon-faced Sadness sabotaging happiness as if shes under a spell -- and becoming even more morose for having disappointed Joy.During a disastrous morning at Rileys new school Sadness triggers an emotional avalanche that forces her and Joy to leave the control tower and reboot the girls brain. With only Fear Disgust and Anger in charge Rileys personality flatlines. Once kids read The Bell Jar in high school -- assuming parents worried about trigger warnings havent lit Sylvia Plaths books on a pyre -- theyll recognize Riley as the poets pint-size reincarnation just without the words to explain shes ""very still and empty the way the eye of a tornado must feel moving dully along in the middle of the surrounding hullabaloo.""Hullabaloo is right. Joy and Sadnesss cerebral trek is giddy with in-jokes from Psychology 101 which children wont get at all. (The frantic animation at least gives them something wild to blink at -- even more than Cars 2 the style is more busy than beautiful.) A literal Train of Thought chugs past an abstract-ideas chamber where the girls are flattened into Picassos then through the imaginations french fry forest and above an underground subconscious haunted by a giant clown. Warns Sadness ""Its where they take all the troublemakers."" On foot with Joy dragging Sadness after she becomes too leaden to walk they lurch past a cleanup crew that erases Rileys fading memories -- phone numbers piano lessons presidential facts -- and meet the imaginary best friend she dreamed up as a toddler a hybrid dolphin-elephant with a cotton-candy torso who refuses to admit that he could be entirely forgotten even as his left arm begins to fade.

That truth melts parents into blubbering wrecks but wont click with children until their 15th rewatch. No rush.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Adventurousness is an odd thing to ask of a major animation studio especially one receiving its marching orders from Disney. And yet for a few years there around the turn of the decade the tireless team players at Pixar took real risks--concocting a highbrow ode to fine dining staging long stretches of wordless dystopian action and confronting audiences of all ages with the staggering sadness of a dying spouse. Inside Out the first new Pixar movie in two years takes place almost entirely within the mind of a preteen girl where five personified emotions struggle to guide her through a life crisis. Bucking the current company mandate of churning out lesser sequels and prequels its not just a brilliant idea but maybe the most conceptually daring movie the Bay Area animation house has ever produced. And thats really saying something what with WALL-E on the books.Looked at one way this is a very simple story of childhood growing pains Forced to say goodbye to her friends and the happy life shes built in small-town Minnesota 11-year-old Riley (Kaitlyn Dias) is abruptly uprooted when her father lands a job in San Francisco. The mundane hardships that follow--a disastrous first day at the new school a sports tryout gone wrong--dont unfold from Rileys perspective exactly. Rather theyre experienced through the eyes of her emotions the anthropomorphized feelings that run the control booth in her mind. Joy a Simpsons-yellow sprite voiced by a perfectly cast (and perfectly chipper) Amy Poehler is de facto leader of the group. But she has to share console space with the other color-coded voices in Rileys head eye-rolling Disgust (Mindy Kaling) skittish Fear (Bill Hader) literally hotheaded Anger (Lewis Black) and glum Sadness (Phyllis Smith).Inside Out in other words presents the latest of Pixars private worlds those secret societies just beyond the perception of regular people. (Think Toy Story. Think Monsters Inc. Think Harry Potter for an off-brand example.) Heavily metaphoric this particular universe is governed by a number of rules most of which are explained during the necessary evil of an opening exposition dump. As Poehler reveals through load-bearing voice-over Rileys personality is represented through a series of themed islands like Honesty Family and the all-important Hockey. Memories the currency of her headspace arrive in the form of glowing orbs colored by a particular shade of emotion. The script pokes fun at these various laws by having the characters literally consult ""brain manuals""--something the audience wont require thankfully as the film is mostly efficient in that blessedly breezy Pixar way at keeping the plot humming along.Eventually Joy and Sadness find themselves sucked out to the warehouse-like recesses of Rileys mind leaving the other three emotions to run damage control from their pale tower headquarters. From here Inside Out runs on parallel tracks cleanly crosscutting between Rileys inner and outer worlds. The meat of the movie is the buddy-comedy adventure embarked upon by Joy and Sadness whose mismatched rapport--the former is a Leslie Knope-like go-getter the latter an incorrigible defeatist--provides the Parks And Recreation/The Office crossover event we never knew we wanted. The filmmakers have cutesy fun with the machinations of their cerebral kingdom A literal train of thought zigzags around the crumbling personality islands as Joy and Sadness venture into the horror-show basement of Rileys subconscious get flattened by her capacity for abstract thinking and--in the films most inspired gag--bumble onto the movie set of her dreams. Meanwhile the other emotions struggle to navigate the minefield of early adolescence; one terrifically funny set piece teased in the trailer puts them in a stalemate with the emotions running her parents minds.Visually speaking this isnt one of the companys most spectacular creations nor does it fully exploit the comic possibilities of its premise. One cant help but imagine the bustling bureaucracy Andrew Stanton might have constructed in Rileys noggin or the madcap mayhem Brad Bird could have wreaked. But people dont just look to Pixar for wit and invention; they crave those little detonations of emotional truth a hallmark of the studios output since Woody met Buzz two decades ago. Thankfully Inside Out is also the brainchild of Pete Docter biggest feeler in John Lasseters directing stable whose Up--the last truly exceptional Pixar movie--left no eyes dry a few years ago. Like his previous movie his new one is chiefly concerned with the tough business of letting go and Docter works his own special magic on the audience. His most casually devastating creation is Bing Bong (Richard Kind) Rileys nearly forgotten imaginary friend. Part elephant part dolphin all tragicomic figure Bing Bong scavenges the dusty shelves of his creators memory bank. Hes the most poignant symbol of what the movie is really about the gradual almost imperceptible demise of childhood.Its Docters endgame the final heartening point he lands on that launches Inside Out into the upper echelons of Pixars filmography. The directors after something thematically grander a vision of adolescence thats not so different from Boyhood at least in the insistence that its lifes seemingly insignificant moments that shape who we become. If the characters are more one-dimensional than say Andys toys--most of them expressing the single emotion for which theyre named--its because theyre mainly moving parts in Docters message delivery system. And what a message The most radical thing perhaps about this ambitious family film is the profound case it makes--to kids but more plainly to their parents--that feeling melancholy is not just healthy but entirely necessary. Sadness in other words is as important as happiness. Thats convenient of course for Pixar to say as Inside Out will reduce more than a few viewers to hot messes. Come for the high concept stay for the lump in the throat.

Photo Credit TNS advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Inside the head of an 11-year-old girl several Emotions are thrown into turmoil. Rated PG (some scary moments). BOTTOM LINE Only Pixar could turn a metaphor into a heart-tugging story about preteen growing pains. Absolutely brilliant. CAST Amy Poehler Phyllis Smith Bill Hader Mindy Kaling LENGTH 135 Inside the head of Riley the 11-year-old heroine of Pixars ""Inside Out"" are a bunch of Emotions jockeying for dominance. Its a cute idea but potentially problematic. Is this movie about a person or the ""people"" inside her? Are these little characters alive exactly? And what could happen narratively speaking to an Emotion? Pixars latest animated film turns out to be one of its best ideas ever. ""Inside Out"" is a whimsical adventure through the human psyche and its brimming with that classic Disney-Pixar magic. The kid-friendly notions of mental machinery may not be scientifically accurate but ""Inside Out"" is reaching for deeper truths. This is one of those rare movies that will teach you something about who you are and why. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Its also brilliantly funny and endlessly imaginative thanks to a team of writers led by director Pete Docter (""Up""). The heroine-within-our-heroine (Kaitlyn Dias is the voice of Riley) is a manic pixie named Joy with the chirpy voice of Amy Poehler. Joy helps create happy memories -- little amber-colored spheres -- that support the pillars of Rileys personality Friendship Island Family Island and so on. Fear (Bill Hader) keeps Riley safe Anger (Lewis Black) improves her hockey game and Disgust (Mindy Kaling) handles not only food issues but matters of fashion and social norms. Critics picksThe best animated films ever madePhotosBig movies out this summer As for the listless blue lump called Sadness (Phyllis Smith) ""I dont know what she does"" says Joy. Those two opposing Emotions become the stars of the buddy-comedy that follows. When Riley and her parents (Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan) move from bucolic Minnesota to urban San Francisco Joy and Sadness go missing leaving the more negative Emotions at the controls. The result is a sullen preteen heading toward emotional shutdown. ""Inside Out"" leaves no metaphor unexplored no joke uncracked. Joy and Sadness will peek into the Subconscious catch a Train of Thought and even sneak onto the back lot of Dream Productions. Rileys imaginary friend Bing Bong (Richard Kind) emerges from Long-Term Memory to help. By making invisible concepts visible ""Inside Out"" does a marvelous job of explaining the way the world affects us and vice versa. It also proves that Sadness has her uses something that children and adults alike may find comforting to know. advertisement | advertise on newsday ----- 210 MoviesInside Out trailer The animated Amy Poehler in four more animated roles Newsday Tweets from Newsday/newsday-staff ""Inside Out"" star Amy Poehler has found her voice as an actress. Here are four more animated features where youve heard her golden throat. SHREK THE THIRD (2007) -- Poehlers Snow White was no shrinking violet especially when she rocked out on Led Zeppelins ""Immigrant Song"" to band together the forest animals to attack the castle guards. DR. SEUSS HORTON HEARS A WHO (2008) -- In this film version of the childrens classic Poehler was the voice of Sally OMalley wife to the Mayor of Whoville and the mother of 96 children which accounted for a considerable portion of the towns population. ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS THE SQUEAKQUEL (2009) -- Poehler was all smiles and chipmunk cheeks as Eleanor one-third of the Chipettes a female rock trio who start off as rivals to Alvin and the boys. Christina Applegate and Anna Faris voiced the other Chipettes who put their spin on ""Single Ladies"" and ""Put Your Records On."" They were heard again in 2011s ""Alvin and the Chipmunks Chipwrecked."" FREE BIRDS (2013) -- The feathers flew in this animated flick featuring Poehler as a lovable turkey who falls for a rebellious gobbler (voiced by Owen Wilson) whos out to change the Thanksgiving menu. Unfortunately the movie was something of a Swift Butterball at the box office. --Daniel Bubbeo Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

Its a scary new school and no friends except for her emotions Joy (Amy Poehler perfection) used to be in charge. Now shes on a trip with Sadness (Phyllis Smith all touching gravity) to recover Rileys best memories. That leaves Fear (a comically hyper Bill Hader) Disgust (Mindy Kaling mistress of dismissive cool) and Anger (Lewis Black finding the vocal equivalent of a head bursting into flames) in charge over at Riley HQ. Ah adolescence explained at last. The idea has been tried -- remember TVs Hermans Head? -- but never with the artful brilliance of filmmaker Pete Docter (Up; Monsters Inc.). Docter gets into our control centers as well as Rileys. We all hear voices in our heads -- no not the kind that get you locked up. As envisioned by Docter co-director Ronnie Del Carmen and co-writers Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley Inside Out isnt so much a tale of emotions at war as it is emotions angling for a truce reflected in Michael Giacchinos glorious mood-leaping score. Too sophisticated? Maybe so when the film takes us to the dark subconscious ""where troublemakers go."" Kids will probably roll with the abstract punches thrown by this burst of pure imagination.

"Pixars Inside Out magically brings emotions to life - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Pixars Inside Out magically brings emotions to life Inside Out Pixar A scene from ""Inside Out"" showing Fear left (voiced by Lewis Black) Joy (Amy Poehler) and Disgust (Mindy Kaling). A scene from ""Inside Out"" showing Fear left (voiced by Lewis Black) Joy (Amy Poehler) and Disgust (Mindy Kaling). (Pixar) Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter Review Pixars Inside Out turns emotions into people inside a girls head and the effect is magical Pixar stands alone and ""Inside Out"" shows you why.At once sophisticated and simple made with visual magic and emotional sensitivity casually probing deeper questions about what matters in life ""Inside Out"" typifies the best of that cartoon colossus. It goes not only to places other animation houses dont dare but also to places the rest of the pack doesnt even know exist. The same could be said for Pixar mainstay and ""Inside Out"" director and co-screenwriter Pete Docter. The third animator to be hired by Pixar in 1990 and Academy Award-nominated for his work on ""Toy Story"" ""WALL-E"" and ""Monsters Inc."" Docter hit his stride when he took home the animated feature Oscar for directing ""Up.""Like that film ""Inside Out"" manages to be honest and unafraid but never cheaply sentimental where emotion is concerned evoking a largeness of spirit whose ability to be moving sneaks up and takes us by surprise. Its examination of the life and thoughts of an 11-year-old Minnesota girl named Riley Anderson is memorable both for what it does and the relaxed way it does it. ""Inside Out"" doesnt just deal with Rileys actions. It combines imaginative conceptualization with inventive animation to tell a parallel story to show whats going on in Rileys mind (""Meet the little voices inside your head"" is one of the films ad lines) as five different emotions push her to act in different ways. It was Pixar creative chief John Lasseter has said ""one of the most difficult films weve ever made."" Inside Out trailer Watch the trailer for ""Inside Out."" Watch the trailer for ""Inside Out."" See more videos This visualization of the mind was not done off the top of anyones head so to speak. Docter and co-writers Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley consulted closely with serious scientists some of whom claimed humans have to deal with up to 27 different emotions. The five that made most lists were selected and then in a process that took years the story and the relationships between emotions were refined and an ideal cast of actors was assembled to energetically voice them.At first there is only Joy (Amy Poehler) a bouncy glowing pixie type alone at the control console in what everyone calls headquarters. ""Just Riley and me forever"" she enthuses ever the optimist but it is not to be. In just 33 seconds Sadness arrives and soon after come Anger Disgust and Fear each with an agenda to advance and a role to play.

This week the movie world descends on the Cannes Film Festival for 12 days of ritzy red-carpet premieres hobnobbing on yachts and nonstop wheeling and dealing. While an international array of filmmakers vies for the coveted Palme dOr prize and distributors agents and producers hawk their wares... (Oliver Gettell) A nervous string bean type Fear (Bill Hader of ""Saturday Night Live"") worries a lot and keeps Riley safe. ""We didnt die today"" is a typical pronouncement. ""I call this day an unqualified success."" Disgust (Mindy Kaling) protects Riley from things that might not be good for her while Anger a short squat guy with a very short temper (comic Lewis Black) wants you to know as Joy very deftly puts it that he ""cares very deeply about things being fair.""Which leaves us with Sadness an emotion with a purpose no one can quite put a finger on who is given to saying things like ""Crying helps me slow down and obsess about the weight of lifes problems."" Voiced by Phyllis Smith of ""The Office"" and beautifully visualized with big round glasses and a huge turtleneck sweater Sadness is a puzzle even to herself.Joy by contrast is a confident individual who likes to say ""We can fix this"" and ""We can do it."" Its Joy who shows us around headquarters explaining how memories (visualized as glowing globes that are color-coded by emotion) are created. Core memories the really important ones have combined to create a series of personality traits called islands (Goofball Island Friendship Island Family Island) that combine to ""make Riley Riley.""So far so good. But then in an abrupt jolt at the end of the ""Inside Out"" pre-credit sequence the family (including Mom [Diane Lane] and Dad [Kyle MacLachlan]) abruptly moves from Minnesota to San Francisco so Dad can go to work for the inevitable start-up company.Naturally the move upsets Riley and it causes chaos in headquarters as well. Sadness it seems cant stop herself from touching happy core memories and turning them sad and when she and Joy get into a tussle about this they both are accidentally ejected from HQ and transported to the endless corridors of Long Term Memory where things really get interesting.For as imagined by Docter and his cohorts these outer reaches of the mind are filled with numerous areas of fascination. They are patrolled by Mind Workers like Forgetters who periodically assign recollections to the dreaded Memory Dump as in ""nothing comes back from the Dump.""On their own without a map and desperate to get back to headquarters Joy and Sadness experience Imagination Land (where the French fries grow tall as sequoias) the Hollywood-style Dream Production area the Train of Thought (its a real train) and the Subconscious where Sadness explains ""they take all the troublemakers.""Meanwhile back at HQ Fear Anger and Disgust are on their own running Rileys mind which leads to the kind of emotional states and genuine problems for Riley that are completely consistent with the pre-teen state of mind. The question is whether Joy and Sadness helped by Rileys almost forgotten imaginary friend Bing Bong (voiced by Richard Kind) can make it back in time to stop real damage being done to Rileys life.Because the Pixar brain trust (which besides Docter includes executive producers Lasseter and Andrew Stanton) is brilliant at story the saga of ""Inside Out"" finds room for crisp action genuine jeopardy cartoon slapstick even adult humor like a jest that references ""Chinatown.""Even better as in the best of Pixar are thoughts and insights about the human experience. Though it doesnt seem that way at first the five emotions are not rivals jousting for power and control; they are united by wanting the best for Riley. And when Joy begins to understand the value and purpose of Sadness that leads to moments no one is going to forget.kenneth.turanlatimes.com Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Reviews Entertainment Movies Amy Poehler Joy in Inside Out Inside Out Pixar delivers a rewarding emotional journey reviews say Pixar reveals risky film Inside Out set in a girls brain Cannes 2015 Studios to drop in with Mad Max Inside Out Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad81deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-inside-out-review-20150619-column.html#navtype=outfit,200,insideout34,insideout,latimes

Like ""Wall-E"" ""Up"" and ""Toy Story 3"" it takes the animation form -- something that was in another generation strictly for children -- and uses it for some honest metaphysical inquiry. In the course of the whole year there will probably be no American movie so concerned with looking inside and so interested in the components of a meaningful life as ""Inside Out."" Just in terms of story efficiency the movie is a marvel. It takes complicated and abstract ideas and communicates them with such deftness and clarity that even a small child could grasp them immediately. In the headquarters of a little girls mind five emotions -- Joy Sadness Anger Fear and Disgust -- see through her eyes. Sometimes they collaborate and sometimes they compete for dominance. They work in a watchtower surrounded by colored glass balls that roll in on chutes. These are memories. The yellow ones are happy and the blue ones are sad. And every so often the lights go on and a core memory is created the kind that is never forgotten. Related Stories Why does Amy Poehler play such happy people? Stars and their kids hit the red carpet for Inside Out premiere The world of ""Inside Out"" has the lived-in feeling of something that has been refined and worked on over a period of years. There is a land of forgotten memories (a kind of black hole) and a subconscious region that is shadowy and ominous. Theres a land of abstract thought where everyone starts looking like a Cubist painting and a ""train of thought"" that follows no prearranged course or schedule. There are even maintenance people going around getting rid of unused thoughts so that all thats left of four years of piano lessons are ""Heart and Soul"" and ""Chopsticks."" The ideas themselves are good and then a whole other process had to render them in visual terms such as the Dream Center that functions like an old-time movie studio. The movie can be funny about how the mind works -- for example the maintenance people perversely keep a gum-commercial jingle ever alive in memory. But there are other touches that are simply and rightly poetic such as the rule that if Sadness (Phyllis Smith) touches a happy memory it stays sad forever. The movie follows Joy the brightest and most energetic of the emotions. Joy is voiced by Amy Poehler who usually comes across as arch but here she gives a performance of enlivening and unfailing vibrancy. She is the dominant emotion in the life of young Riley (Kaitlyn Dias) who is a normal happy child living in Minnesota -- and then the unthinkable happens. No not death. Not war or famine. Riley and her family have to move to San Francisco That means going to a new school and living in a house that seems narrow and rickety by the suburban Minnesota standards but that would go for at least a million probably 1.3 in the current market. Pixar which is based in Emeryville knows San Francisco well and filmmakers Pete Docter and Ronaldo Del Carmen have fun poking fun at the city as seen from an outsiders point of view. Appropriately Pixar doesnt give us the postcard San Francisco but the working city of bus terminals and busy streets. This is all good news. The not-as-good news is that like ""Wall-E"" and ""Up"" ""Inside Out"" has a great opening a satisfying finish and something of a sag in the middle. But this time its only a sag. ""Wall-E"" was a 40-minute movie of genius hiding inside a 98-minute sprawl. ""Inside Out"" is 94 minutes and would have been better at 70 but the bottom never drops out. Along the way the movie tosses out interesting ideas almost in passing about the nature of sadness (lethargic self-pitying) but also its proper place in a healthy life. And in the back of it all is a slight ache for time passing the running motif in all of Pixars best films. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Set largely inside the mind of an 11-year-old girl named Riley this teeming tear-duct-draining exhaustingly inventive surreal animated comedy is going to be a new pop-culture touchstone. In all kinds of ways its a mind-opener. Related Stories How Inside Out Director Pete Docter Went Inside the 11-Year-Old Mind Amy Poehler Mindy Kaling on Inside Out and More Watch a New Clip From Pixaras Inside Out Notice I said mind not brain since the neuroscience isnt precise. Were in the realm of feelings. Docter -- instinctively in sync with corporate as well as pop culture -- has conceived of our head space as a vast sprawling theme park its high-tech vaguely hypothalamic-shaped headquarters located in a central control tower overseen by five emotions working in harmony and not infrequently disharmony. Joy Fear Disgust Anger and the especially wayward Sadness have human form although their shapes colors genders and protean capacities vary. Joy (voiced by Amy Poehler) the movies heroine is a radiant yellow gamine sunshine personified; she spritzes particles of energy when she moves. Sadness (Phyllis Smith) is a blue bespectacled lump. Disgust (Mindy Kaling) is pickle-puss green. The two more volatile emotions -- frazzled stringy purple Fear (Bill Hader) and squat red Anger (Lewis Black) -- are plainly male a bias Ill leave to mens-rights groups to protest. Heres the really important part In Docters mind-design emotions literally color memories which get stored in small bowling balls that roll in after each new experience glowing yellow red green purple or blue. Memory balls loom large in Inside Out. Their colors it turns out may be altered sometimes with devastating consequences. Thus when Riley and her family move from bucolic Minnesota to San Francisco Sadness fingers a golden ""core memory"" ball -- Rileys recollection of ice hockey with friends -- and chills it blue. The problem is that as memories go so goes the psyche until this once-ebullient little girl is suddenly a ball of mute despondency. From HQ Joy watches in horror as nearby ""islands of identity"" -- Friendship Island Family Island Goofball Island Hockey Island -- sink into the mist. While Joy labors to keep Sadness (and Fear and Anger) from touching more memory balls Rileys entire personality seems on the verge of disintegrating. Yes that sounds damn serious for an animated ""family"" comedy. And it is serious. Most of Pixars movies are rooted in the pain of loss -- of a whole planet (Wall-E) of a family (Finding Nemo Up) or just of childhood when the world seemed a simpler and more joyful place. But Inside Out stops short of catastrophe -- or clinical depression. As gloomy as Rileys situation is its not extraordinarily gloomy. Its not outside the bounds of normal human experience. You often hear that the arc of a persons life is determined not by the misfortunes that come his or her way but by how he or she responds to them. And thats what Docter (who wrote the script with Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley) is trying to chart in the weirdest zaniest most slapsticky way without therapyspeak but for deeply therapeutic ends how haywire contradictory emotions can reassemble themselves into something halfway adaptive. Much of Inside Out is a carnivalesque odyssey Having been sucked up a chute and propelled to the far end of Rileys mindscape the fundamentally at-odds Joy and Sadness must find their way back to headquarters before everything really goes to hell. The road is anything but straight. The obstacles are riotous. Docter and his Pixar team have packed the film with gags -- visual verbal broad glancing -- and I cant think of one that doesnt have psychological philosophical cultural or just fascinating architectural underpinnings. The Long Term Memory facility was apparently inspired by a Jelly Belly candy factory and an egg-processing plant and what its unromantic custodians choose to purge and what to keep shall not be revealed here. Dreams are scripted and shot in a mini Hollywood studio (not called DreamWorks alas) near the giddy freewheeling Imagination Land and the Subconscious where dreams go to become nightmares. The most surprising encounter is with a friendly dopey clown called Bing Bong (Richard Kind) who was once Rileys imaginary friend. Happy as he is Bing Bong carries a trace of the melancholy of Toy Storys toys. He was once a major part of Rileys inner world and loves her still. But he has no place in the mind of an evolving 11-year-old. Inside Out was five years in the making and its a sign of how gingerly and exactingly Docter felt his way through the material that he reportedly decided during production to throw out much of his second half. The two lost adversarial Emotions struggling for control of Rileys psyche werent supposed to be Joy and Sadness but Joy and Fear. I can see why that made sense at first -- and why it went nowhere. Fear is almost always the antagonist in Hollywood coming-of-age movies particularly male-centered ones. Boys get girls by conquering their cowardice and standing up to bullies. Underlings vanquish shame and learn to carpe the diem. No less brilliant a sad sack than Albert Brooks identified fear rather than sadness as the principal barrier to self-realization -- to moving to the next level of spiritual awareness -- in Defending Your Life. But Docter must have seen through that macho construct and wanted something different for his little girl not just because it made more psychological sense but because Joy and Sadness though opposed are easier to reconcile. Joy is stronger and is more stable with an awareness of Sadness. Their colors can blend. It would be difficult to overpraise the vocal stylings of Amy Poehler who conveys not just supernatural exuberance but the semi-tonal quavers of doubt that keep that said exuberance from being cloying or cartoonish. Michael Giacchinos score is marvelous even by his own exalted standards. Each region of Rileys mind has its own melodic character but exists in relation to the larger organism -- a factory in which every cog and pulley is soulfully in tune. Like come to think of it Pixar.

"Inside Out review Best Disney-Pixar film since Up - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Inside Out review Best Disney-Pixar film since Up Inside Out WP-Bloomberg Fear (voiced by Bill Hader) from left Joy (Amy Poehler) and Disgust (Mindy Kaling) are among the feelings inside the mind of Riley in ""Inside Out."" Fear (voiced by Bill Hader) from left Joy (Amy Poehler) and Disgust (Mindy Kaling) are among the feelings inside the mind of Riley in ""Inside Out."" (WP-Bloomberg) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Saying ""Inside Out"" is the best Disney-Pixar film since ""Up"" says less than it should. Director Pete Docters ""Inside Out"" springs from a single terrific idea. What if a persons basic emotions were tiny humanoid sprites sharing a command center a spacious variation on the one in the starship Enterprise but inside the human brain?While the idea isnt new (you may recall the late 20th-century sitcom ""Hermans Head"" or not) it is vastly adaptable. As the Pixar Animation folks learned a long time ago before they coupled up with Disney If your premise has the knack of simplicity you can pretzel your narrative any way you want and still find your way back home. Saying ""Inside Out"" is the best Disney-Pixar picture since ""Up"" in 2009 says less than it should considering the distressing if profitable recent mediocrities ""Cars 2"" and ""Monsters University."" Some of ""Inside Outs"" internal complications are more fruitful than others. I saw the world premiere at Cannes in May; a second viewing reveals more fully the flaws in the overstuffed middle section -- the manic ""Wreck-It Ralph"" quality as the audience lurches in and out of various parts of its 11-year-old protagonists increasingly bummed-out psyche. For a while the film gets a little lost along with two of its primary brain-dwellers Joy and Sadness voiced by Amy Poehler and Phyllis Smith.And then it finds its way home. Home and where the heart is guides the thinking of co-writer and director Docters film co-directed by Ronnie Del Carmen and co-written by Meg LeFauvre and Josh Cooley. ""Inside Out"" follows a few months in the life of Riley voiced with un-actressy directness by Kaitlyn Dias. Shes the daughter of a loving Minnesota couple (Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan) whose lives are shaken up by a move to San Francisco for dads uncertain new startup venture.Suddenly Rileys sense of place is scrambled and shes looking for a compass. Her emotions scramble in turn to work out some equilibrium. In addition to ringleader Joy and her flip side Sadness theres Anger (Lewis Black blowing his stack); Disgust (Mindy Kaling bratting it up) and Fear (Bill Hader voicing a walking talking twitch). Each time Riley experiences a benchmark moment in her life whether its the first hockey goal or a stroll down the sidewalk with her best friend it transforms into a ""core memory"" represented by a small glowing round ball of the emotion-appropriate color. These and others are collected by Joy at the end of each day and if the majority of the emotions are happy ones it has been another success for the team. Inside Out director Docter talks gross anatomy Christopher Borrelli Pete Docter native of Bloomington Minn. tall and animated looked wide-eyed around the lobby of the Museum of Science and Industry earlier this month and above the cacophony of school children shouted ""Do they still have the fetuses?"" A reporter said he couldnt hear him. ""The fetuses?"" Docter... Pete Docter native of Bloomington Minn. tall and animated looked wide-eyed around the lobby of the Museum of Science and Industry earlier this month and above the cacophony of school children shouted ""Do they still have the fetuses?"" A reporter said he couldnt hear him. ""The fetuses?"" Docter... (Christopher Borrelli) The core memories power Rileys ""islands of personality"" aka Goofball Island Family Island Honesty Island and others. Joy and Sadness are sucked up a tube and plunked down into uncharted territory near Rileys long-term memory storage. They must find their way back to the control center amid an ever-shifting array of animation styles and dimensions and assist Riley in her darkest moments as she struggles to settle into her new life.A lot of younger viewers (and older ones) may be put off by the rugged emotional terrain of ""Inside Out."" The frenzied quality of the middle section is heightened by Rileys onetime imaginary friend a hybrid cotton-candy-textured playmate called Bing Bong voiced in a routinely aggravating turn by Richard Kind. (Even when hes underplaying hes overplaying.) Theres a moment when Fear monitoring the action in Rileys fraught subconscious jeers ""Boo Pick a plot line"" Thats an intriguing moment of self-critique. Jurassic World review Reptile dysfunction Michael Phillips Bailed out by a few good jolts ""Jurassic World"" gets by barely as a marauding-dinosaurs narrative designed for a more jaded audience than the one ""Jurassic Park"" conquered back in 1993.

Bailed out by a few good jolts ""Jurassic World"" gets by barely as a marauding-dinosaurs narrative designed for a more jaded audience than the one ""Jurassic Park"" conquered back in 1993. Why was director Steven Spielbergs film version of the Michael Crichton novel a hit? In an industry built... (Michael Phillips) But theres a truly lovely resolution completely trackable even for preteens resting on the notion of mixed emotions and the value of acknowledging lifes hardships rather than papering them over with false good cheer. This is why ""Inside Out"" works. We feel for the girl at its center and when things go right after going wrong the swell of emotion is neither cheap nor bombastic.The musical score comes from the best in the business Michael Giacchino and while his work here is less vivid than his best a film featuring a nearly nonstop barrage of ideas and voices needs some breathing room.Perhaps Pixar will never again reach the heights of its remarkable string of masterworks ""Wall.E"" ""Ratatouille"" and ""Up."" The best of ""Inside Out"" comes close. The life of Riley is not exotic; her troubles are not unique. But they are rendered with serious imagination by Docter and company.Phillips is a Tribune critic.mjphillipstribpub.com""Inside Out"" - 3.5 starsMPAA rating PG (for mild thematic elements and some action)Running time 135Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Inside Out Me and Earl and the Dying Girl review Tender humorous romance Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising72deg",http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-inside-out-movie-review-pixar-20150616-column.html#navtype=outfit,200,insideout37,insideout,chicagotribune

VPCPete Docters film about the emotions inside a girls head is risky inventive and hilarious. A winning return to form for the studio. With Amy Poehler Phyllis Smith and Richard Kind.Disney-Pixars ""Inside Out"" takes us to the most extraordinary location yet - inside the mind of Riley.(Photo Disney-Pixar)Story HighlightsCritics rating 5 stars (out of 5)Docters film is incredibly inventive and hilarious to boot.Its the best Pixar film since ""Toy Story 3"" and ranks among the studios best.Youre just going to have to trust me on this.""Inside Out"" is a movie that takes place mostly inside the head of a girl -- a confused girl going through big changes. The main characters are her emotions only one of which involves happiness. Sadness steals the show. And it will make you cry.Oh yes. A lot probably.Cant wait to line up for tickets huh? Who doesnt want to pay money to cry?Trust me. You want to see this movie. You need to see this movie. Because ""Inside Out"" is terrific a mind-bending concept turned into a brilliant film a return to form for Pixar not just in terms of quality but in taking risks -- risks that pay off.More Sadness pays off for Phyllis Smith in Inside OutThe story centers on Riley (voice of Kaitlyn Dias) an 11-year-old girl growing up happily in Minnesota who has to move with her family to San Francisco because her dad got a new job. We know Riley is happy because we see her joy on the outside -- and her Joy on the inside. Inside her head specifically where Joy (Amy Poehler) Sadness (Phyllis Smith) Fear (Bill Hader) Anger (Lewis Black) and Disgust (Mindy Kaling) reside working daily at a kind-of control panel that dictates Rileys moods. All play a part in Rileys mental make-up but for most of Rileys life Joy has taken the lead. Shes a happy kid.We get a quick tour of how all this works and its hilarious and wonderfully creative. At the end of the day balls are generated that contain memories and are stored or if theyre particularly important added as core memories. (In one great bit workers toss out memories no longer in use like the names of presidents or piano lessons to make room for new ones.) The memories are color-coded like the emotions themselves; the majority are yellow like Joy.Related 2015 summer movie guideBut the move to San Francisco doesnt go as smoothly as expected. Sadness in her own understated self-deprecating way is becoming more active. She loves Riley as much as the rest of them she just cant help herself. Its in her nature.She is kind of meddlesome though the bracing tonic to Joys non-stop happiness and optimism. (Fear Anger and Disgust all play important parts in Rileys life as they do in everyones but theyre very much supporting characters.)As if Rileys apprehension wasnt enough things go awry inside her head. (Or maybe its the other way around. Thats part of the genius at work here.) Without giving too much away Joy and Sadness wind up on a journey throughout Rileys brain away from the control center to which they are trying to return. It is deliriously inventive. Along the way they encounter all sorts of twists and turns that play like a theme-park ride for kids and a why-you-feel-that-way primer for grown-ups.5 stars Goodykoontzs 5-star movie reviewsWhile they are on this unplanned tour Riley slips into unhappiness and confusion. On the outside Rileys home in San Francisco is in a sketchy part of town the hockey team she tries out for isnt like the one in Minnesota friends are harder to find.

(Kevin Winter/Getty Images) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Tuesday June 16 2015 948 PM Title ""Inside Out"" Film Info With the voices of Amy Poehler Bill Hader. The emotions inside a girl help her through a difficult time. Director Pete Docter (130). Preceded by a short film. Area theaters. Whatever brainstorm led the Pixar team to ""Inside Out"" it led to the most extraordinary film of the year. This deep rich perceptive and funny adventure takes place inside one kids consciousness but is very much about all of us. Within the brain of an 11-year-old girl named Riley five primary emotions sit at the controls of ""headquarters"" behind Rileys eyes. Theres ebullient Joy (Amy Poehler) mopey Sadness (Phyllis Smith) skittish Fear (Bill Hader) fiery Anger (Lewis Black) and judgmental Disgust (Mindy Kaling). Their names are their duties and theyre also responsible for taking new memories which look like shiny orbs and putting them into long-term storage or assigning them to the Core Memory area which make Riley who she is. But Sadness whose job has been annoying to the other emotions and seemingly a problem takes a prominent role after Riley and her mom and dad move from Minnesota to San Francisco. When Joy and Sadness get drawn up into the tube where memories go it corresponds with Rileys sorrow at having to leave her friends hockey team backyard and life behind. To get back to headquarters Joy and Sadness travel through the maze-like corridors of Long-Term Memory hop the Train of Thought -- and keep Sadness from touching any more memories. To help them they have the plaintive creature Bing Bong (Richard Kind) who was once Rileys imaginary friend. Even more urgent Rileys ""islands of personality"" the basis of who she is are crumbling into the chasm-like ""Memory Dump"" where dusty recollections fall never to be seen again. Thats causing Riley to make decisions she may regret the rest of her life. The storys complex but Pixar knows how to make sophisticated notions accessible kicky and fun. Director Pete Docter does something similar to what ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" did Send us someplace where concepts like abstract thought dreams or imagination are presented literally. (Theres also a bit of ""Fantastic Voyage"" in the brain-fold-like pink steps that lead to the subconscious ""where they send troublemakers."") When Riley gets an idea theres a collection of light bulbs that screw into the control board. But theres another deeper thing going on here as there are in the best of Pixars films. ""Inside Out"" is not only about how joy and sadness -- the emotions not the characters -- work because they complement each other but about how growing up is an often melancholy process of recognizing that who we once were isnt who we are now. The smart screenplay lets a wistful notion of Minnesota stand in for Rileys past; by wanting to get back there Riley is unconsciously grasping for the younger self she used to be. As the voice in her head Poehlers Joy is a perky pixie always looking on the bright side of things until heartbreakingly she sees how essential sadness is. Smith is a funny frump whose Droopy Dog rhythms are also comforting. Black is hilarious as the hair-trigger temper while Kaling and Hader add verbally limber humor to the Limbic system. Joy and Sadness navigate through Imagination Land. (Pixar) Anger in the film Inside Out. (Pixar) Sadness and Joy in the movie Inside Out. (Pixar) Technically the film is a whole other kind of marvel. The animation is otherworldly and fluid even more advanced than the studios previous high-water mark ""Toy Story 3."" The visual flourish of mental sectors like ImaginationLand Dreamland Productions and Abstract Thought -- where everything becomes Picasso-like and two-dimensional -- is witty and wonderfully dynamic while Michael Giacchinos terrific score captures wellsprings of feeling in a simple tinkling-piano theme that winds up soaring. ""Inside Out"" is the years best film so far. After you see it youll say thats a no-brainer. jneumaiernydailynews.com Follow me on TWITTER NeumaierMovies Catch ""Joe Neumaiers Movie Minute"" throughout the day Thurs. - Sun. on New Yorks WOR 710 AM and at wor710.com.

Aside from about five decades of breathing room what sets our current heyday apart from that previous gilded era of Pinocchio Dumbo and Bambi isnt just our fancier technology but also a richer sense of narrative sophistication. After all when Robin Williams blasted out of his lamp like a big blue wish factory firing off rat-a-tat topical gags and celebrity impressions he wasnt just aiming at the films usual target audience of tykes he was also aiming over their heads at the adults in the theater. Since then no one has refined this double-barreled storytelling technique into art quite like the folks at Pixar. Time and again the Bay Area studio aces the tricky high-wire act of cranking out kids movies that adults can also enjoy on a different--and deeper--level. Now with their latest film the transcendent and touching Inside Out theyve taken that approach a step further. Theyve made a movie thats so smart and psychologically clever it may leave little ones scratching their heads wondering why their parents are laughing so hard and getting so choked up. Its the first film I know of thats been marketed to kids but is in actuality made for grown-ups. Directed by Pete Docter the maestro behind Monsters Inc. and Up Inside Out takes place almost entirely inside the head of an 11-year-old Keane-eyed girl named Riley (voiced by Kaitlyn Dias) whose happy life is thrown for a loop when her family moves from idyllic Minnesota to unwelcoming San Francisco. Because she has to make new friends and go to a new school--and because shes well 11--Rileys mind is going through some tumultuous changes. And thats where we meet the movies moody menagerie of color-coded characters. Laid out like the sterile control room of the starship Enterprise this nerve center is dominated by the irrepressible Joy (a bubbly blue-haired pixie voiced by Amy Poehler) and rounded out by Fear (Bill Hader a high-strung purple beanpole) Anger (Lewis Black perpetually on the brink of blowing his red top) Disgust (an eye-rollingly sarcastic Mindy Kaling) and Sadness (The Offices Phyllis Smith who frumps and frowns like Debbie Downer--wah-wah--and almost steals the show). Docter and his fellow screenwriters Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley take this daring conceptually abstract premise and tweak it into a battle royal for control over the tweens evolving personality. Each emotion gets a turn in the drivers seat depending on what Rileys going through in her day-to-day life. And for the first time in Rileys brief existence it looks like Poehlers Joy may not carry the day. Theres enough slapstick and silliness to keep kids entertained (including Richard Kinds quickly-being-forgotten imaginary friend the rainbow-colored elephant Bing Bong). But the film also has a bittersweet streak about the loss of innocence and the fleetingness of childhood. In the end the message of Inside Out seems to be that sadness as painful as it is is not only unavoidable but essential to joy...and to Joy.

Photo Disney MOVIE REVIEW Inside Out Running time 102 minutes. Rated PG (cartoon action). Pixars got its mojo back -- and how -- with ""Inside Out"" a hilarious and touching animated masterpiece that takes a gloriously imaginative sometimes scary leap into the mind of a girl on the cusp of adolescence. After a quartet of uninspired cash grabs (""Toy Story 3"" ""Cars 2"" ""Brave"" and ""Monsters University"") designed primarily to sell toys Disneys quasi-independent computer-animation arm returns to the glory days of ""Finding Nemo"" ""The Incredibles"" ""Ratatouille"" ""Wall-E"" and ""Up"" with an envelope-pushing instant classic from ""Up"" director Pete Docter. Joy (left voiced by Amy Poehler) and Riley.Photo Disney Like those earlier gems ""Inside Out"" manages the wonderful trick of tickling the funny bones of kids giving them lots of eye candy and action to gorge on while engaging the hearts and minds of their parents and grandparents with a sophisticated story line. A 1960s-style control room running 11-year-old Rileys brain has always been dominated by the relentlessly upbeat Joy (voiced by Amy Poehler). She has largely held her companions Sadness (Phyllis Smith) Fear (Bill Hader) Anger (Lewis Black) and Disgust (Mindy Kaling) at bay while they generate Rileys thoughts and feelings. But when hockey-loving Riley (voiced by Kaitlyn Dias) moves with her parents (Diane Lane Kyle MacLachlan) from idyllic Minnesota to a frighteningly urban San Francisco the young girls unhappiness and fears bubble up threatening to obliterate all those happy childhood memories (represented by glowing glass globes) that Joy delights in archiving. Sadness (from left voiced by Phyllis Smith) Fear (Bill Hader) Anger (Lewis Black) Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Joy (Amy Poehler).Photo Disney The end of Rileys childhood innocence causes a malfunction that accidentally launches Joy and Sadness on a journey deep into Rileys psyche while Disgust Fear and Anger temporarily take control of her emotions with predictably chaotic effects. Its a totally satisfying adventure with lot of surprising twists and one of the best emotional payoffs in the Pixar canon. The films brilliantly elaborate and colorful visuals (including outmoded emotional ""islands"" that are disappearing) mesh with the smart script (by Docter Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley) chronicling the dramatic changes that Riley is going through en route to adolescence including a plan to run away from her new home back to Minnesota. First though Rileys part-elephant imaginary friend from childhood (Richard Kind) will get one last chance to help rescue Joy and Sadness from being stranded far from the control room -- before he and his magic sled are literally consigned to the ash heap. Joy (left) and Sadness navigate through Imagination Land.Photo Disney Poehler does an incredible job voicing the ebullient bright-yellow (with blue hair) Joy who learns to appreciate the importance of Smiths all-blue sometimes passive-aggressive Sadness -- and even the role of Blacks extremely funny red Anger who literally blows his top. ""Inside Out"" is packed with audacious concepts that work beautifully -- from a movie studio in Rileys brain that cranks out dreams to a tower of imaginary boyfriends -- but theyre all in service of concepts that would receive the blessing of Sigmund Freud and Bruno Bettlelheim. And by all means stick around through the closing credits for a preview of Rileys upcoming adolescence which promises to be an even bigger emotional roller coaster (as every parent knows).

Director Pete Docter is lets not forget the man responsible for the opening montage in ""Up"" so if you think youre getting out dry-eyed from a movie where one of the main characters is literally Sadness youre made of sterner stuff than I. (Im still finding stray bits of the handkerchief I destroyed while watching ""Toy Story 3."") The kind of movie that may forever change the way children -- and even adults -- discuss their feelings ""Inside Out"" is an epic set inside a little girls mind where her emotions have been kicked into high gear after her family uproots from Minnesota and relocates to San Francisco. This being a Pixar film and not a Disney one both parents are alive; this being a fantasy they can afford a place in San Francisco even though dads company is still a start-up. See Video Inside Out Trailer Pixar Teases an Emotional Trip Down Memory Lane (Video) First things first The film begins with the birth of Riley and deep inside her head we meet Joy (voiced by Amy Poehler) a sprightly pixie who generates all of Rileys delighted gurgles. Joy is soon joined on the job by Sadness (Phyllis Smith ""The Office"") whos in charge of crying. Before long theyre sharing the control room in Rileys brain with Fear (Bill Hader) Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Anger (Lewis Black) all of whom will play a role in Rileys development. As Riley (Kaitlyn Dias) grows up her brain develops particular ""islands"" devoted to her goofball sense of humor her friendships her skill at sports her honesty and her love of her family. The move to California unsettles that real estate as Riley must leave behind friends and her hockey team to face uncharted territory. Joy goes into overdrive on the first day of her new school trying to keep Sadness at bay -- every time Sadness touches one of Rileys memories depicted as a glass marble that memory becomes an unhappy one -- leading to an accident in which Joy and Sadness get launched out to the furthest recesses of the brain. With Fear Anger and Disgust running the show Riley slips deeply into a funk and considers running away back to Minnesota. Her well-meaning parents try to help but its up to Joy and Sadness to get back to the controls to keep Riley from making mistakes that cant be fixed. Docter and co-director Ronaldo Del Carmen working from a script by Docter Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley have a lot of fun tooling around the brain literalizing neurological concepts (Paula Poundstone and Bobby Moynihan play the workers who dump old memories to make way for new ones and theres a soundstage where Rileys dreams are ""produced"") while treating the place like an efficient factory thats more ""Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex"" than ""Hermans Head."" Also Read Pixars Inside Out Tracking for 60 Million Debut We get to follow our heroes through Rileys abandoned imagination -- where they meet her neglected made-up pal Bing Bong (Richard Kind) -- and watch Joy discover that Sadness isnt something you suppress. As the ""Free to Be You and Me"" TV special told us four decades ago its OK to cry. More than OK in fact There are moments in ""Inside Out"" that are as emotionally gutting as anything Ive seen in a Pixar film. At the same time though I was surprised at how fleeting the experience felt. In the theater I was moved and enchanted but within hours it all felt sketchy. The best of the studios output mixes emotion and strong storytelling resulting in movies that stay with you after even just one viewing; here the ""go to the place and get the thing"" plotting feels at odds with the sweet central metaphor about finding balance and allowing yourself to feel your feelings. It smacks of the impulse that turned ""WALL-E"" from a lovely little silent movie to a knockabout chase in outer space. Also Read Pixars The Good Dinosaur Gets First Trailer Poster (Video) Theres still a lot to love here from an outstanding voice cast -- which also includes Paula Pell Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan -- to a visual palette that contrasts the candy-colored world of a young girls mind with a more photo-realistic San Francisco. A stronger structure underpinning these emotions run amok would have benefitted the film but then what would feelings be without a little messiness? For many viewers giving their own Joy and Sadness a workout will be enough to make ""Inside Out"" a valuable experience. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Thanks to ""Up"" director Pete Docter the company manages an overdue bounceback with ""Inside Out"" the most imaginative example of world-building since Docters own ""Monsters Inc."" The movie envisions a set of anthropomorphized emotions living inside the head of troubled 11-year-old Riley (Kaitlyn Dias) who collaborate each day on controlling her moods and storing her memories in the complex machine of her memory banks. The most charismatic of these eccentric guardians is Joy (Amy Poehler) who focuses on capturing Rileys happier times while staving off the anxiety-riddled effects of Fear (Bill Hader) Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and especially Sadness (Phyllis Smith). Outside their cavernous command center Rileys kingdom of memories expand to a crop of islands representing various dimensions of her personality. That heavy set up leads to a beguiling workplace adventure in which Joy and Sadness inadvertently get exiled from the drivers seat while Riley spirals into pre-teen despair as her family moves to a new town and -- devoid of the proper coping mechanisms -- lashes out. It goes without saying that ""Inside Out"" looks magnificent at every turn from the bright storybook colors of Rileys mind to the credible design of human expressions. But the movie truly engages by holding fast to its allegorical ramifications. Each plot development invites scrutiny for its symbolism Yes its a vibrant witty adventure but whats really going on here? While Sadness struggles to deal with her tendency to drag down Rileys mood Joys relentless commitment to bringing it back up reeks of blind idealism. Through their struggles to traverse the darker recesses of Rileys mind this pair -- aided by Rileys long-forgotten imaginary pal Bing Bong (Richard Kind) a goofy whale-dolphin thingamabob -- the entire plot forms a single prolonged metaphor for the fragmented cycle of growing up. The result is some of the most compelling insight into the complexities of human behavior from the Pixar canon since Remy in ""Ratatouille"" asserted that ""change is nature.""  This time around that could be the tagline. No matter its sophistication however ""Inside Out"" never ceases to play around. Joys colleagues are blocky figures whose antics maintain both abstract meaning and slapstick appeal most substantially with Anger whose head blasts flames when hes on a tear. But ""Inside Out"" also succeeds at extending this conceit to a broader plane. On several occasions Docter and co-writers Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley shift to the emotion control rooms in the minds of other humans from Rileys life most significantly when they go to her parents. At the dinner table in Rileys mothers mind her emotions complain about her husbands lack of constructive parenting while he zones out to a sports game. These abrupt windows into the forces behind decision-making constantly nail their punchlines. Beyond that they hint at a grander perspective on the arbitrary nature of passionate outbursts. ""Inside Out"" cranks up its own emotional pull around the third act when a series of dramatic circumstances touch on the painful dimensions of abandoning past obsessions in favor of newer ones. Pull back from the moment-to-moment thrill of ""Inside Out"" and it gets very deep The scenario implicitly questions standard definitions of free will by suggesting that were all slaves to ghosts in the machine. Its a heady notion rendered in outwardly silly ingredients resembling a process of intellectual smuggling that at one point might have been considered vintage Pixar -- but ""Inside Out"" shows that the approach remains vital as ever.

"Review Inside Out is Pixars smartest film yet - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Inside Out is Pixars smartest film yetBy Tony Hicksthicksbayareanewsgroup.comPosted 06/16/2015 070000 AM PDTUpdated 06/17/2015 041240 PM PDT Related StoriesJun 16Director Pete Docter Why Inside Out almost didnt get madePixar is in a unique spot. Its no longer even a question anymore whether a movie produced by the Emeryville-based studio is good or not (""Cars 2"" aside which wasnt bad just blah). The question now is how good or perhaps how does it compare to other Pixar films?""Inside Out"" may not be Pixars best but its certainly its smartest. The complex juggling of adolescent emotions is something everyone has experienced or will experience. So that makes director Pete Docter and pals latest creation their most relatable to its audience in a colorfully wonderful way. Tackling the complexity of whats going on inside a human brain powering the transition from childhood into adulthood easily could be mangled by lesser filmmakers making it awkward or confusing or trite. A great blend of thoughtfulness and understanding went into ""Inside Out"" and the outcome will likely again raise the bar for other studios trying to keep up. (L-R) Joy (voiced Amy Poehler) and Sadness (voiced by Phyllis Smith) catch a ride on the Train of Thought in Inside Out. (Disney/Pixar) ( Disney/Pixar ) Riley (Kaitlyn Dias) is an 11-year-old hockey-loving girl whose parents (Kyle MacLachlan and Diane Lane) just uprooted her from Minneapolis to San Francisco. Along with having to adjust to life at a new school and finding new friends Riley has to deal with some pretty dramatic culture shock. Enter Rileys brain where in a vivid control room lives her five primary emotions Joy (Amy Poehler) Fear (Bill Hader) Anger (Lewis Black) Sadness (Phyllis Smith) and Disgust (Mindy Kaling) overseeing Rileys emotions and trying to keep everything balanced.Advertisement As Riley becomes unhappy with her new life the crew upstairs struggles to keep her afloat. In doing so the conflict and occasional confusion that go on in an adolescents brain (or anyones really) become something an audience can readily relate to. Thanks to the way it is illustrated its something even younger kids who despite early assumptions by some that the plot might go over their heads can understand fairly clearly. Another plus The way Pixar constructs its ideas makes it visually fantastic. Anger (voiced by Lewis Black) in Inside Out. (Disney/Pixar) ( Disney/Pixar ) The real fun begins when the five emotions cant agree on how to deal with these life-changing events. Eventually the ever-perky leader of the group Joy takes Sadness accidentally departing the control tower on a beautiful mini-adventure through the brains various functions. One of the goals becomes to protect Rileys core memories of a happy life keeping her attuned to the fact that everything isnt so bad. Joy and Sadness are a great team at sorting things out. Unfortunately real life is starting to make various things in Rileys brain crumble and it doesnt help that Anger Fear and Disgust are running the show back at headquarters. Eventually Riley decides she cant take San Francisco anymore and wants to go home to the chilly Midwest. Docter and co-director Ronaldo Del Carmen -- who also co-wrote the story with Docter -- do a solid job alternating the scenery between Rileys outside and inside worlds which is important as one of their goals was to demonstrate the connection to younger viewers. The casting is spot on -- Poehler gives Joy the right balance of fairy-tale optimism assisted by modern-day female problem-solving savvy. Most surprising is Black. Though the aggressively apoplectic comedian is seemingly perfect for the role I was concerned he might be too much. He isnt.The ending is typical Pixar which means a solution is found that sends people home happy. They made this one just right -- lots of magic and optimism grounded in relatable realism with occasionally stunning visuals and just enough weighty content to make you feel like you might want to see it twice.

Entertainment Pixars ""Inside Out"" Will Literally Give You All The Feels Call it a comeback -- Pixars new movie charmed Cannes as the companys best in years. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Joy (Amy Poehler) and Sadness (Phyllis Smith). Disney/Pixar ID 5778023 When the Disney logo flashed on screen at the start of the first Cannes screening of Inside Out there was a smattering of applause from the crowd followed by a few retaliatory tongue-in-cheek boos. When the Pixar logo arrived? Nothing but cheers.It was a 30-second encapsulation of how some movie lovers have come to view the relationship between Pixar and the company that bought it in 2006. The former is the beloved brand behind a near-miraculous run of movies that were captivating but complex funny and sad genuinely made for adults and children. And Disney is the media giant under whose ownership Pixar has ramped up to a film-a-year schedule with a greater emphasis on sequels some great (Toy Story 3) and some not (Cars 2). While even lesser Pixar is usually still pretty damn good its been tempting to attribute the companys underwhelming last few years to the Mouses boot on its neck a more comforting narrative than the one in which no hot streak lasts forever.Whatever the truth you can call Inside Out a comeback a return to form a gratifying reminder that no one else would attempt to make a childrens tentpole movie about how emotional pain is just as essential a part of life as happiness -- and no one else would be able to pull it off quite like this. Based on an original idea by director and writer Pete Docter Inside Out takes place primarily in the head of 11-year-old Riley (voiced by Kaitlyn Dias) whose idyllic life is shaken up when her family moves from Minnesota to San Francisco. While not as daring in form as WALL-E or Docters own Up Inside Out sets its epic adventure in some brilliantly unusual territory -- the developing mind of a girl having to learn about change empathy and letting things go. Disney/Pixar Disney/Pixar ID 5778096 The concept is laid out in a limber introduction in which infant Rileys first emotion Joy (Amy Poehler) pops into being inside her head. To her mild consternation shes quickly joined by Sadness (Phyllis Smith the movies unexpected MVP) whose role in Rileys life Joy doesnt understand. Then come Anger (Lewis Black) Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Fear (Bill Hader) each of whom gets a turn at Rileys control panel depending on whats going on in her life. Rileys memories form as bowling ball-sized spheres tinted to indicate the feeling each one represents and capable of being projected back like home movies. Most of those memories glow a Joyful yellow as Riley grows up under the care of her loving parents (Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan) in the Midwest.Theres more to the movies cartoon conception of the brain details of which whirl by so quickly that their cleverness doesnt really sink in until after the fact -- like the way the blob-shaped mind workers in the permanent memory department scoff ""Theyre all in her phone"" while clearing away unnecessary records of telephone numbers. Inside Out does feel more frantic than past Pixar movies especially when Joy and Sadness accidentally end up in the far reaches of Rileys mind journeying through different areas in an attempt to get back. The frenetic energy of the interior storyline is an attempt to balance out whats actually a grounded and somber outside one in which Riley upset about the friends and home shes left behind pulls away from her distracted parents and starts to consider running away. View this image > Disney/Pixar ID 5778577 The combination of the bright and the tearful has always been Pixars strong suit and in a movie thats literally about all the feels this has never been more apparent. But the tears that it extracts are earned by themes that are delicate and sophisticated -- ones about being a child and starting to understand that your parents have just as many uncertainties as you do ones about how no one is happy all the time and that no one should be and ones about how growing up comes with letting go of some of the things you loved when you were younger.Inside Out which opens in the U.S. on June 19 continues what Toy Story 3 started only this time were not seeing things from the perspective of the toys being left behind but from inside the mind of the person whos doing the leaving. The pain you feel in your heart at the end? Its the good kind the bittersweet reminder that time is always passing.

TWITTER The latest Pixar feature personifies the sensations of early adolescence as animated characters. A 60s avant-garde head trip repackaged as a big slice of mainstream entertainment Inside Out could easily have been titled Childhoods End as it ingeniously personifies the furiously erupting sensations associated with the onset of adolescence as a bunch of emotionally competitive cartoon characters. This latest conceptually out-there creation from Pete Docter (Monsters Inc.; Up) serves up some abstractions and flights of deconstructive fancy that will most likely go over the heads of viewers with ages in the single digits. But this adventurous outing manages the great Pixar trick of operating on two levels -- captivating fun for kids disarming smarts for adults -- that sets the studio apart. Reliably big summer grosses appear in store. Although the outward physical story of the script by Docter Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley traces the difficult adjustment suffered by tomboyish 11-year-old hockey player Riley when shes uprooted by her parents from an idyllic Minnesota life to an unfriendly San Francisco the real setting is inside the girls head. Its a highly combustible place a control room staffed by the buoyant blue-haired Joy; red top-blowing Anger; purplish equivocating Fear; green eye-rolling Disgust and squat all-blue Sadness. Read more John Lasseter Calls Inside Out Cast ""One of The Most Talented"" in Pixar History The mind as we know is a hectic place with all sorts of things bouncing around in it and Docter and his team have visualized it in very antiseptic almost 60s TV Star Trek fashion as a room centered around a control panel and lined with shelves and tubes where memories and thoughts are stored. Joy has always held sway in Rileys heretofore happy life; but now faced with a depressing new home an unfamiliar school no friends and the loss of her old hockey team Sadness with assists from the others is definitely ascendant. It all flashes by very quickly but at night control passes over to the long-term memory bank (which is hilariously seen at one point being divested of such content as piano lessons and the names of U.S. presidents) and there is a literal train of thought. If this were a different kind of film you could easily imagine you were headed in the direction of William S. Burroughs and his friends (although if there is a sequel it might have to deal with the effect of mind-altering substances on the brain). As it is Joy and Sadness take a trip down the rabbit hole of Rileys fraying psyche which leads into very foreign and internalized territory as far as mainstream animation is concerned. Externally Riley is slipping fast withdrawing from her solicitous and caring parents rebelling against her new surroundings becoming sullen and for the first time in her life is genuinely depressed all of which leads her to plot running away from home. Read more Russias Animated Snow Queen to Get Third Installment (Exclusive) What this looks like from the inside is a turbulent decomposing landscape traversed by an increasingly desperate Joy and her ever-present companion Sadness whose exile has seen Disgust Fear and Anger completely assume control of Riley. The outcasts endure a perilous journey during which the physical representations of Rileys idyllic childhood all come toppling down and the illusions of innocence essentially represented by a kid-friendly elephant (with odd accoutrements from other critters) must be left behind. Although this journey through the psychic and emotional underworld could have been a lot more harrowing hellish and Bosch-like than it is it will still probably appear perilous enough to real kids younger than Riley who have never suffered through a crisis before. What the film charts then in its highly original and disarmingly physicalized way is the competition among the oppositional aspects of human nature. In this respect Joy is the protagonist and heroine but the script doesnt pretend that any of the other emotions couldnt take over and lead one to the wrong destination. Its an audacious concept and Docters imagination along with those of his numerous collaborators is adventurous and genially daft enough to put it over. And there are unexpected surges of emotion in the late-going as Rileys equilibrium is re-established and the primacy of the parent-child bond is reaffirmed. Amy Poehlers energetic voicing of Joy dominates the dialogue and quite agreeably so. All the other voice actors blend in nicely without being too eccentric -- Bill Hader portrays Fear Mindy Kaling is Disgust Lewis Black is Anger and Phyllis Smith is the unassertive but undeniable Sadness. Among the ""real"" characters Kaitlyn Dias plays Riley Diane Lane is Mom and Kyle MacLachlan is Dad. In a cheeky move on the part of Bay Area-based Pixar San Francisco is for once portrayed in a negative light (the familys new home is located on a cramped dingy downtown street). As usual with the companys fare there are plenty of blink-and-theyre-gone jokes including the depiction of the part of the brain that creates dreams as a movie studio. In the end Inside Out has to be one the most conceptually trippy films ever made as a PG-rated popcorn picture for the general public.

On paper ""Inside Out"" sounded like another lunatic gamble an adventure that takes place entirely within the head of an 11-year-old girl featuring her Emotions as characters -- although if anyone could pull off a logline like that it would be the team that made us care about rats who cook toys that bond and robots who fall in love. Sure enough in execution Pixars 15th feature proves to be the greatest idea the toon studio has ever had a stunningly original concept that will not only delight and entertain the companys massive worldwide audience but also promises to forever change the way people think about the way people think delivering creative fireworks grounded by a wonderfully relatable family story.SEE MORE Cannes Film Festival Could ""Inside Out"" be Pixars best movie? Frankly that question is almost beside the point. Objectively speaking several of the studios previous films work better in terms of character appeal or narrative accomplishment (though when it comes to cartoons playing favorites is inevitably a subjective game). In terms of its ambitious underlying concept however ""Inside Out"" blows the others away going beyond the screen to become something audiences will carry around for the rest of their days -- not as tie-in merchandise or spinoff theme parks (although there will inevitably be plenty of both) but as an elegant and iconic visual metaphor for understanding their own emotions and empathizing with others. ""Do you ever look at someone and wonder what is going on inside their head?"" asks Joy a radioactive-yellow gal (voiced by Amy Poehler at her peppiest) who serves as both narrator and chipper team captain for a group of five Emotions assigned to Headquarters the place in Rileys brain where all her thoughts and feelings originate. As the upbeat young heroines dominant Emotion Joy serves alongside blue Sadness (Phyllis Smith) violet Fear (Bill Hader) fiery red Anger (Lewis Black) and green Disgust (Mindy Kaling) to manage memories generate ideas and otherwise help Riley deal with lifes challenges. Just when her Emotions think theyve got everything under control Rileys parents decide to move from Minnesota to San Francisco sending her Emotions into turmoil -- because its not enough for Pete Docter and co-director Ronnie Del Carmen to introduce such a compelling model for how the brain really works; theyre also expected to craft an interesting story around it. For the first 11 years of Rileys life her Emotions have stood crowded around an instruments panel of what looks like an air-traffic control tower inside her head. Amusingly swift glimpses into the minds of other characters suggest everyone is wired more or less the same way while still allowing for wild variation in the efficiency of the five Emotions theyve been dealt. In Rileys case shes young and her Emotions are still hammering out the dynamic between themselves. Like whats Sadness role exactly? ""Im not actually sure what she does. Ive checked"" Joy says hinting at one of the points on the films positive-minded agenda helping young audiences to understand and appreciate what role Sadness plays in their own lives. (If only the film could also teach them that Boredom isnt necessarily bad either but merely the sign of an inactive mind.) Incoming memories are stored in bright glowing orbs color-coded according to whatever Emotion was dominant at the time she experienced it then stored in the appropriate place in the vast landscape of her mind. (Oddly while Rileys memories play like little movies projected inside her head but seen from an objective outside view her dreams are made at a movie studio with a subjective p.o.v. camera.) Rileys brain might as well be another planet -- unusually dangerous all things considered with different islands for each of her key qualities. Its full of amusing nooks and crannies like Imagination Land and the more sinister Subconscious which this fantastic voyage takes time to visit along the way giving composer Michael Giacchino the chance to augment his heartening score with separate mood-appropriate themes for each of these realms. Too often movies that introduce wildly fantastical parallel worlds never find time to explore them -- the way Dorothy only visits one corner of Oz in the 1939 film or how ""Wreck-It Ralph"" only taps into a few of its potential gaming universes. Docter and Del Carmen make it a point to poke around here and though the film absolutely could have been denser theyve opted for just the right balance of context and story lest spending too much time with the Emotions deprive auds of experiencing the actual emotions that come from connecting with Riley and her family. For that reason although ""Inside Out"" takes place almost entirely in Rileys head every so often the film surfaces to check in on how shes doing in real life as if taking a deep breath of relatability before plunging back into her more abstract interior world since it otherwise might been all too easy for the film to get ""lost in thought."" We see Riley as an infant at several stages in her childhood and again at 11 (Kaitlyn Dias) trying to cope with the disappointment of San Francisco where the familys house is a dump new friends are hard to find and playing hockey isnt the same as it was in Minnesota. Though her parents (Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan) express concern its up to Riley -- and by extension the five Emotions struggling to operate her mental command center -- to keep her happy amid all these changes. But somethings off Blame it on the cross-country move or the approach of puberty but the Emotions dont seem to work as they always have before. Most alarming Sadness is tired of being excluded but every time she touches something it turns blue ... and so does Riley. Joy -- who superficially resembles Disneys favorite fairy Tinkerbell minus the wings -- means well but shes a bit of a control freak and in trying to protect Rileys ""core memories"" she accidentally ejects herself and Sadness from Headquarters. Its a long way back as the brain terrain crumbles around them and in the interim Rileys mental state begins to unravel with Fear Anger and Disgust left in control unwisely deciding that the best idea is for Riley to run away. Given the sheer complexity of concept it was wise for Docter and his team to keep the story simple although one cant help but wonder how an edgier emotional challenge -- such as divorce death or an unthinkably risky ""trans-parent"" situation -- might have given Rileys character so much more to deal with. While Riley and her world look consistent with Pixars other human creations dating all the way back to ""Toy Story"" everything to do with her Emotions demanded a unique visual solution. Docter and Del Carmen seem to have reached into Disneys past for inspiration seizing on the 1950s-era style seen in shorts like ""Toot Whistle Plunk and Boom"" (plump bespectacled Sadness looks just like that Oscar winners Professor Owl host) as well as then-rival UPAs more abstract cartoon aesthetic (Fear resembles Gerald McBoing-Boings dad while a crazy shortcut to Imagination Land embraces such deconstructionism outright). In addition to linking the project to a period when advances in color film processes and stereoscopic 3D sparked wild visual experimentation in cinema ""Inside Outs"" retro look fits well with Pixars cutting-edge technology blending vintage style choices with lighting and texture options previously unavailable to animators. Even something as seemingly basic as the Emotions skin texture -- more of a pulsing mass of glowing electron-like particles really -- reflects unexpected solutions to infinite questions Docters gonzo idea must have raised. In other cases its the streamlining of ideas that serves the material so well from the vivid colors to the way the story always comes back to parent-child relations playing equally well to both demographics. As choices go the voice casting couldnt be better for all five of the Emotions. Smiths Eeyore-like Sadness serves as the perfect foil to Poehlers ebullient Joy while Angers surprisingly cute appearance and diminutive stature make Blacks scenery-chewing performance that much funnier. Hader plays Fear as a nervous jitterbug while Kalings disaffected Valley-girl delivery keeps Disgust (who has the least to do) feeling like an integral part of the team. While the initial idea was directly suggested by Disneys 1943 ""Reason and Emotion"" short -- a wartime one-reeler that characterized the eponymous disciplines forever dueling for control -- the Pixar team has rethought the model giving it the most intuitive and indelible form with the result that viewers cant help but imagine a similar dynamic operating in their own heads. To borrow a notion from Malcolm Gladwell the pics ""stickiness factor"" is through the roof making it one of those rare movies that transcends the medium the way Melies visualized a moon landing or Romero invented zombies. Concepts like this come around maybe once a decade but linger for centuries and even if others (like early-90s TV show ""Hermans Head"") got there first youve gotta hand it to Pixar for making it endure. At the risk of hyperbole people will still be thinking in terms of these anthropomorphized Emotions long after movies as we know them are gone in the distant future when screens are obsolete and immersive stories are beamed directly into your frontal lobe. Theres a reason they call Pixars inner team the ""Brain Trust"" They can be counted on not only to imagine but to execute such original ideas as these.

Big waste of money Very disappointed The bulk of the movie was melancholy borderline morbid and overall dragged on with the negative of Rileys journey. I kept praying for it to finally end Reply Paul says June 19 2015 at 620 am This story is NOT an original idea as the critic states in his review Im sure I will love the movie along with my 9 yr old daughter just as I loved reading the Numskulls comic strip in the UKs Beano and Dandy comics of the 1970s and 80s Reply Phil Nolan huiru (PhilNolan3D) says June 15 2015 at 1036 pm So maybe you dont actually think Pixar invented this idea as the Inside Out commercial would suggest. Reply Paully says June 15 2015 at 647 pm Remember Mikey Eisner did not want to takeover PIxar. Now Pixar runs the show-even at Disneyland. Eisner was until recently ruining er running a Bubblegum card company. With the destruction of Toon Town (replaced by Northern Cals SW Land yeah..) upon us the Eisner nightmare is way behind us. Congrats to Ms. Jobs and Mr. Lassiter. Reply GMJ says June 14 2015 at 141 pm The story idea is not as original as the critic claims. Although Im very interested in watching the movie my first thought after viewing the trailer was ""So basically its an animated version of the 1990s Fox-TV comedy series ""Hermans Head"" without the Lust character."" Reply Phil Nolan huiru (PhilNolan3D) says June 15 2015 at 1038 pm Yes its really annoying that all the critics keep claiming what an original an inspired idea this movie is when its a blatant knock off of a 90s sitcom. Reply Al in SoCal says June 15 2015 at 857 pm Thank you for this. I was a HUGE fan of Hermans Head and that is exactly what popped into my head (hehe) when I saw the trailer. Anyway - looks fun but definitely not original. Reply Richard D. Erlich says June 15 2015 at 934 pm Indeed And when I saw HERMANS HEAD in 1991 the thought went through my mind -- possibly from my Snark aspect -- ""Didnt I see this as a Second City Routine?"" Kevin Adams says June 9 2015 at 1203 pm Geez thanks for revealing a lot of surprises for us. Reply Ekul says May 25 2015 at 848 am Aw I cant wait And no cursing Aw Reply Paul Tatara says May 23 2015 at 503 am Gosh thousands of people should do years of intense research and write thousands of books about the workings of the human mind so well have something besides this Pixar film to help us understand ourselves. Nah. Thats just crazy. Reply Ekul says May 25 2015 at 851 am you never know what is next from Disney They always have awesome movies Reply Rimshot says May 20 2015 at 1041 am unthinkably risky ""trans-parent"" situation OH thank goddess Pixar didnt go there. P Reply Rimshot says May 20 2015 at 1037 am Ew San Francisco. No wonder the poor kid freaked out. D Reply Shikhar Tyagi says May 20 2015 at 305 am Please excuse any mistakes as my English is not very good. There are no spoilers in this review. I had the pleasure of seeing Inside Out at Cannes and I must say it was wonderful and a huge step-up from Pixars recent efforts. The trailers dont really do it justice. The story may seem complicated for younger viewers but the way Pixar tells the story fits for both adults and children. The pacing is in the vein of Wall-E and in that sense it is very much a film for adults as it is for kids (like most Pixar movies). The story here is surprisingly raw and emotional one that has very deep underlying themes that adults will connect with. Many of the audience members were crying at the end. It has one of the most original stories for an animation in the last few years and I believe many people (especially adults) will form a connection to it. Speaking of animation the film is breathtakingly beautiful. There is a nice contrast of colors that make it look vibrant like Pixars UP. The voice cast did a wonderful job and you couldnt ask for better direction from Pete Doctor and co. I cannot wait to see this a second time with family and friends. Highly recommended. PS The short that played before the film Lava was also beautiful. It was sort of a musical and it was quite funny and clever. The audience even applauded at the end of it myself included. In that sense it provides the entire package a nice balance of joy and laughter (Lava) followed by deep storytelling and emotion (Inside Out). Reply sosterstrom says December 29 2015 at 1054 pm Your review was the most helpful one on here. Thanks for adding it. Reply Eric Von Zipper says May 18 2015 at 146 pm Peter I know I can my youngest daughter will love this movie. Thank you for the insight on your subjective opinion of it to provide some background on what we will see. That said I ""feel"" some storyline about a ""trans-parent"" is hopelessly cloying and ridiculously misplaced for a childrens film. Yes that is what you were watching. As for our children I assume you must have zero based on your egregious and subversive suggestion theyll have plenty of time to be adults later and can then choose yes choose whether to watch and then decide what if any support they give to one side of a mental health issue. That being transvestitism and gender identity disorder. Thanks Reply Peter Debruge says May 18 2015 at 407 pm Fair enough although my point in making that one quibble was that Pixar takes such a big risk with this concept and then plays it incredibly safe in terms of the emotional challenge that faces Riley. But theyve certainly gone with the most universal option possible nearly every child moves at some point and it can be a tough adjustment. The best cartoon on that subject is and will always be ""My Neighbor Totoro"" which compounds how hard it is on the characters by having their mother sick in hospital. Reply Phil Nolan huiru (PhilNolan3D) says June 15 2015 at 1040 pm My Neighbor Totoro is not a cartoon. Its an animated film. Mark says May 18 2015 at 835 pm Who says ist a ""childrens film?"" Just because its animated? How silly and ignorant. Pixars films have often grappled with weighty mature subject matter-with great taste. Stories adults love and kids love and grow into. Like all the best Disney classics. Sandy Muller says May 18 2015 at 118 pm Sounds so wonderful. I cant wait to take my kids. Unlike Tommorrowland which seems agenda driven. Why must they indoctrinate the children into their awful liberalism? Dont believe me? Read the John Lassiter and Tomorrowland stories on this site. Walt Disney would hate what he created Reply Daniels says June 16 2015 at 132 am Enough with ""liberal agenda"" BS. all that movie was talking about is not everything is written in stone. Anyone can change the future and do something important in this world you just need to do it instead of waiting for others. Reply Edward says May 18 2015 at 1103 am So... you liked it? Reply Terry T says May 18 2015 at 850 am ""a stunningly original concept..."" (COUGH) Hermans Head. (COUGH) On FOX 1991 to 94. Still excited to see this though as it sounds wonderful. Reply jhs39 says May 18 2015 at 1232 pm One of the segments in Woody Allens Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex But Were Afraid to Ask does something along the same lines as well. Reply Victor Field says May 18 2015 at 1122 am ""Concepts like this come around maybe once a decade but linger for centuries and even if others (like early-90s TV show ""Hermans Head"") got there first youve gotta hand it to Pixar for making it endure."" Read the entire review before commenting - is that so hard? Reply Jacques Strappe says May 18 2015 at 934 am There is absolutely nothing that is 100% original. Having seen Hermans Head and not having seen Inside Out its hard to draw a comparison between the two. That being said Pixar is most often brilliant and a game changer at whatever they set out to do. Hermans Head not so much. Take care of that cough though. Reply cadavra says May 18 2015 at 959 am I think the point Terry was making was not that its a previously-used concept but that Peter used the term ""stunningly original"" to describe something that clearly isnt. And based on the second trailer it seems to have an awful lot of the ""Toy Story"" films-""Oh weve become separated Weve gotta get back""-in its DNA as well.
