The trip is meant to be a punishment inflicted by an exasperated drug lord (Edward James Olmos). Theyve stolen millions. He wants the money. They have to return it or hell kill a sexy hostage. Wahlberg and Washington trudge across a river along with some unspecified miserable Mexicans and once theyve climbed from the water rather than look at Washington and say ""I dont know how these guys do it"" or ""Immigration reform"" or something Wahlberg goes in the opposite direction. He smiles. Its the smile some people have after they leave a massage or finish waxing their car. Its the smile of an actor whos reclining on a movie-star beach towel. Wahlberg all but walks around the film with a paper umbrella behind one of his ears. You rarely get to see a pair of stars mired in this much danger but playing the whole thing as if they were on vacation. I dont respect the movies easy cynicism about drugs and crime and government corruption but I do respect its stars kind of ""lets not give a damn."" 2 Guns is based on a comic book by Steven Grant and immediately distinguishes itself from most of the seasons Hollywood films by having two stars near their most watchable and by operating according to a smartish tightish script (by Blake Masters). Washington and Wahlberg play two men -- Bobby Trench and Marcus Stigman -- who arent who they tell each other they are and pretend to be crooks in order to bring down Olmoss character; but of course theres a bigger bad guy and he doesnt live in Mexico. Thematically the film creates a buddy movie out of unstable moral and bureaucratic plate tectonics. These two guys are stuck with each other because theyre the least untrustworthy people they can find and the vacillating suspicion gives both actors something to play. Most of the movie happens in Southwest sunlight. Theres pleasure to be had in that and the jazzed-out way Washington saunters in it. Hes best when hes in a fedora and sunglasses when a movie doesnt need him to be decent just to be good. Hes all confidence here. Hes seen the script. He knows who loses and its not him. The same goes for Wahlberg whos not the star Washington is -- he has to work a little harder at worklessness (as he did to keep up with and eventually surpass Will Ferrell in The Other Guys). But when he has material that lets him explore the vast space between moron and mastermind he keeps surprising you. This is another Wahlberg part where no ones quite sure how much of a simpleton his character is supposed to be. Wahlberg just plays the cockiness and the physique the little guy to Washingtons big man. The script gives them some fine squabbling. When Bobby drops in at Marcuss apartment Marcus expresses some distrust. He couldnt not say he smells a rat and Bobby in Washingtons glorious Mount Vernon cadence asks him to press on ""Let it be said."" The gist of that relationship is not unlike a Midnight Run a cop show from the 1980s or a romantic caper film like Charade except here theyre emphasizing the ""man"" in romantic and the betrayal gladly goes both ways. But the movies director Baltasar Kormakur keeps conflating that gladness with glibness. For instance Marcus shooting chickens buried up to their heads early on is supposed to be comically equal to later telling Olmos that he looks like a Mexican Albert Einstein (which isnt false). Theres more than adequate support from Paula Patton as a lissome DEA agent James Marsden as a crooked Navy commander and a mean ol Bill Paxton who drawls in an accent thats like how the staircase in Gone With the Wind might talk. Meanwhile Olmos remains the kind of actor who can take a stupid stereotype and seduce you into wanting to see an entire miniseries built around him. He actually achieves goony menace because he doesnt appear to believe hes playing a cartoon. But thats what the movie boils down to. Washington and Wahlberg have a good time robbing banks and blowing up buildings and barreling through military security checkpoints and double-crossing people and shooting each other because none of it really means anything. The violence and politics here are cheap. Kormakur insists on that. 2 Guns is actually his third U.S. movie outside his native Iceland and its the first to oil the surface of a thriller for the purposes of hilarity. His previous movie was also with Wahlberg -- the underrated Contraband. When Wahlberg wrapped cash redundantly across his stomach Kormakur was doing sniveling symbolism. This time he snows money down on his gun-shooting stars. Hollywood doesnt need a semiologist to translate. This guy is pre-bragging.

(The Canadian Press) Denzel Washington left and Mark Wahlberg star in the action-comedy 2 Guns.(The Canadian Press) 2 Guns An action-comedy thats smarter than it looks Add to ... Adam Nayman Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Aug. 02 2013 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Aug. 02 2013 1200AM EDT Comments AA Directed by Baltasar Kormakur Written by Blake Masters Starring Mark Wahlberg Denzel Washington Classification 14A Genre action Year 2013 Country USA Language English Like most movies released during the summer months 2 Guns was adapted from a comic book. It disguises its hand-drawn roots fairly well however. To the uninitiated Baltasar Kormakurs energetic action-comedy might suggest another literary source the deadpan crime novels of Elmore Leonard.Thats a compliment by the way. Leonard is a modern master of screwball narrative complications and chest-puffing tough-guy banter and for its hilarious first half 2 Guns holds up its end in both departments. Decked out in a fedora and gold fillings Denzel Washington has a high old time playing a low-roller named Bobby Trench the best-connected crook in Texas. Washingtons flamboyant performances tend to be his worst but this time his exuberance has a purpose its revealed fairly early on that Bobby is actually an embedded DEA agent. His whole flamboyant-scumbag persona is a put-on designed to attract his latest mark. Thatd be Stig (Mark Wahlberg) a muscular hot-tempered thug who Bobby is using to get closer to a Mexican drug lord (Edward James Olmos). But Stig isnt what he seems either. Hes an undercover Navy intelligence officer running a sting operation and his bosses are even more highly placed than Bobbys. Eventually the two undercover brothers goad each other into ripping off a small-town bank where the drug runners are laundering their money - each one thinking that theyll be bringing in an extra bad guy in the bargain.The heist initially goes off without a hitch but the film keeps dropping hints that the pair is in over their heads. During the robbery Stig wears a clown mask straight out of Stanley Kubricks The Killing - a classic about how the best laid plans can always go awry.Kormakur isnt Kubrick of course and 2 Guns isnt really about anything beyond its own swaggering cleverness which starts to wane somewhere around the midpoint. Once Bobby and Stig realize that theyve each been set up by their bosses to take the fall for the bank robbery - the money from which mysteriously goes missing - they head off the grid to regroup. As much fun as it is to watch them snipe at each other while theyre biding their time its all too obvious where the movie is headed. Suffice it to say there will be more than two guns on hand when it gets there.That a movie this fleet and lean succumbs to action-blockbuster bloat in the home stretch is both disappointing and predictable although the director deserves credit for keeping the climactic shootouts slick and spatially coherent. 2 Guns also earns kudos for its supporting cast which includes Bill Paxton as a Panama-hatted CIA spook who specializes in enhanced interrogation techniques and James Marsden as Wahlbergs smirking superior officer. (Paula Patton who plays Bobbys boss and sometime lover is mostly wasted although her romantic scenes with Washington have a nice sense of deja vu). Wahlberg whose dim-bulb act was over-exposed in Pain and Gain fares better here in a more heroic role. Stig is a hothead and a narcissist but hes also just a little bit smarter than he looks. The same goes for 2 Guns as a whole.

Comments click to enlarge 2 Guns Video Rated R  109 minutes  2013 Mark Wahlberg reunites with Contraband director Baltasar Kormakur for an action movie thats even more cynical and sadistic than its predecessor. Wahlberg and Denzel Washington play government agents who rob a bank while posing undercover as criminals. They learn theyve been set up by their crooked superiors who have thrown them to the mercy of an even more crooked CIA man (Bill Paxton) and the Mexican drug lord (Edward James Olmos) whose money they stole. None of these likable actors can make up for the overwhelming mean-spiritedness; this contains an awful lot of torture which the filmmakers render especially ugly by trying to pass it off as fun (mainly by having the characters issue lousy one-liners while its happening). Theres also a bit of misogyny thrown in for good measure.

Some will welcome the very notion of an old-school cop movie which hasnt been CGI-ed up the wazoo but theyd welcome it even more if it had a plot we cared about and fresher car chases shootouts and punch-ups. Still Denzel splitting the difference between righteous decency and badass mofo is in cruise control as a bank robber with a secret identity while Wahlberg surprises us all with a hilarious motormouth turn as the partner in crime with a complex backstory. In Tex-Mex territory teeming with drug cartels Washington and Wahlberg choose the wrong bank to rob. Complications escalate to a tiresome degree leeching the fun from the movie which is slung together with cold competence (and not much more) by jobbing Icelandic maverick Baltasar Kormakur (101 Reykjavik). Final tally 30 mins absolutely primo banter 80 mins gubbins. Occasionally fun but those numbers dont quite add up.

At area theaters. Based on dark comic-book ace Steven Grants series ""2 Guns"" comes with graphic-novel pedigree. Its R-rated. So it lives up to its title with noisy shootouts -- theres even a Mexican standoff -- mixed with other events that go ""boom"" And there are threats of torture and moments of outright deadly dispatch that distinguish it from much of the cartoonish mayhem of ""Red 2"" with which it shares some DNA. But the biggest guns this action flick brandishes are stars Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg who have very different acting styles that work surprisingly well together. Just when this summer season had us wondering which A-listers can not only open but sustain a major release along comes this pair as good as peanut butter and chocolate. Or as DEA agent Bobby Trench (Washington) and naval intelligence officer Michael ""Stig"" Stigman joke the ebony and ivory keys on a piano. That theres little harmonious about their alliance for much of the picture is what makes the movie consistently entertaining. Like ""The Heat"" one of the few bona fide box-office hits of the summer ""2 Guns"" builds its buddy flick atop the notion that its buddies really dont trust each other. As the movie starts Bobby and Stig seem like a team. Theyre casing a bank in a dusty Texas border town. The wrinkle here is each man -- unbeknownst to the other -- is a lawman working to entrap his partner. Thats just one twist in a film rife with them. Without plunging into the labyrinth of plot lets just say the two come to accept that theyve been double-crossed by people they put their trust in. In fact corruption is so rampant -- naval officers DEA honchos or most chilling of all a CIA operative -- that Edward James Olmos Mexican drug lord Papi Greco seems at least transparent in his mean business. With Bill Paxtons turn as a psychopathic CIA agent the movie also recalls ""No Country for Old Men"" without any of the existential insights. More often director Baltasar Kormakur and screenwriter Blake Masters spike the action with comedic touches visual as well as verbal. A garage-door light offers a moment of wonderfully winking wit. And the score has pleasing hints of those breezy violent movies based on Elmore Leonard crime novels. But its Wahlbergs gift for off-the-cuff gab that makes ""2 Guns"" such a kick. Which doesnt mean there arent instances that make you go ""huh?"" How does a high-profile drug dealer not notice the deeply rumbling Dodge Challenger and its two occupants outside his mistress home in a McMansion neighborhood? And what did a woman named Maybelle ever do that her diner deserves the ill treatment it gets from Bobby and Stig? Then theres the bigger problem of Paula Patton who plays Bobbys DEA contact and sometimes squeeze. Pattons got a knotty mission that shes not entirely able to fulfill. Is she damsel or femme fatale or a bit of both? That quandary isnt the problem. The glitch is the movie doesnt make us invested in the answer. A friend once said that buddy movies had stepped into the space once occupied by screwball comedy romances which made a fine habit of pairing two neurotically different personalities with their unexpected complement. He was writing a review of ""Lethal Weapon 2"" at the time. He was spot on. When it comes to ""2 Guns"" hes still right. The result of this screwball shoot-em-up is funny and action-packed -- yup weirdly warm and fuzzy for a movie called ""2 Guns.""

Denzel Washington plays a DEA agent who has been working for 12 months alongside Mark Wahlbergs naval intelligence officer. The catch is both undercover they each think the other is a member of the Mexican drug cartel they are seeking to infiltrate.Its essentially a buddy-cop romp with the usual assortment pack of graphic gruesomeness.

"2 Guns (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review 2 Guns (R) Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg are game but this derivative action picture lets them down. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com8/1/2013 Editor rating 2 The phrase ""casting is everything"" has never felt truer than it does with 2 Guns an unremarkable standard-issue shoot-em-up that rests entirely on the charisma of its two stars. As a pair of secret agents -- unaware of each others identity -- who infiltrate a Mexican drug cartel Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg make a hugely likable pair exchanging one-liners with the same ease in which they trade gunfire with the enemy. Sometimes they even end up trying to shoot each other. Bobby (Washington) who works for the DEA and Stig (Wahlberg) a naval intelligence officer get along fine while pretending to be bad guys. But after they rob a bank hoping to relieve a crime kingpin (Edward James Olmos) of his 3 million fortune and come away with 41 million instead their assignment is essentially over. Both men decide its time to get rid of their partner and turn in the loot to their respective bosses. 2 Guns was directed by Baltasar Kormakur in the same loose laid-back style he brought to last years Contraband. But that film benefited from the relatively fresh backdrop of high-seas smuggling and it also had an actual plot that slowly increased in tension before erupting into action-movie mayhem. The new picture tries to pull off a similar trick throwing in a bunch of baddies and traitors (including Bill Paxton as a murderous CIA agent and James Marsden as a corrupt Navy officer) who gradually come to play a part in the big blow-em-up finale. 2 Guns argues that the international drug trade is so lucrative even U.S. government agencies and the military want to carve out a piece for themselves while nobodys looking. But theres something flat and matter-of-fact about the way in which the movie presents this idea. Paula Patton as Washingtons friend with benefits comes off as a stock romantic interest even after we learn theres a lot more to her than is initially apparent. 2 Guns is refreshingly light on the CGI effects and the big setpieces are well done. But no matter how hard the movie tries everything just kind of sits there. Maybe weve already seen this kind of stuff too many times. The comedy is the only thing that enlivens the film Wahlberg who swaggers through the picture in ""Say hi to your mother for me"" mode has a running gag of mispronouncing words that never gets old and hes prone to making impetuous decisions that Washington must then race to correct. Theyre a fine comic duo and 2 Guns is at its best where theyre allowed to simply riff off each other. Too bad the gunfire always resumes drowning them out. Cast Denzel Washington Mark Wahlberg Paula Patton Bill Paxton James Marsden Edward James Olmos Fred Ward. Director Baltasar Kormakur. Screenwriter Blake Masters. Based on the graphic novels by Steven Grant. Producers Andrew Cosby Randall Emmett George Furla. A Universal Pictures release. Running time 109 minutes.

PATTI PERRET Patti Perret Patti Perret Patti Perret 2 Guns Director Baltasar Kormakur Cast Denzel Washington Mark Wahlberg Bill Paxton Rated R (violence strong language brief nudity) Running time 109 min. By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 1146pm on Thursday Aug. 01 2013 Thursday Aug. 01 2013 Friday Aug. 02 2013 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Judging from the trailers 2 Guns seems like the typical movie Hollywood lets loose in the dog days between Julys blockbuster season and Septembers launch of the Oscar race. Take a couple of big-name stars looking for an easy paycheck put them up against disposable bad guys who never learned to hit a target toss in some explosives roll credits count cash.Yet 2 Guns is better than its ad campaign or release date might suggest. Peppered with solid performances a handful of funny lines and an energetic style that distracts from the contrived convoluted plot 2 Guns -- based on a series of graphic novels by Steven Grant -- is surprisingly entertaining.Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg star as Bobby and Stig hoods who have teamed up in a gangster marriage of convenience to bring drugs across the Mexico-Texas border from cartel honcho Papi Greco (Edward James Olmos). Or so we think. Neither Bobby nor Stig may be who they say they are even to each other. And then when 43 million in cash goes missing -- and everyone from Greco to the CIA and the U.S. Navy (dont ask) wants it and thinks Bobby and Stig have it fists and bullets start flying.The role doesnt demand much from Washington but he still brings a depth and a sense of calculated cool to elevate it above the usual action movie slam-o-rama. The ubiquitous Wahlberg manages to generate some buddy-movie chemistry with Washington and he fits comfortably into the role of the wise-cracking sidekick. But its Fort Worth native Bill Paxton who is the real scene-stealer as a thoroughly Texan yet icily threatening government agent. His pitch-perfect performance of restrained evil is somewhat offset though by the stiff Paula Patton (Jumping the Broom Disconnect) as Bobbys girlfriend.Working from a script by TV writer Blake Masters (Brotherhood Law amp; Order) Icelandic director Baltasar Kormakur ( Contraband) keeps things moving briskly so the plot holes dont turn into gaping canyons. He certainly has come a long way from his low-budget indie days of 101 Reykjavik.In a summer when so many of the hype-heavy movies turned out to be big-budget bores its refreshing when a movie like 2 Guns achieves its admittedly modest ambitions. Still lets hope its not so successful that theres a sequel next summer. 3 Guns would be one too many. Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

Grade C Tired of superhero comic-book movies? The feeble one-two punch of ""Red 2"" and ""2 Guns"" gives you another type of comic-book movie to grow weary of almost immediately the kind based on crime-and-espionage comics. ""2 Guns"" slops over with instantly over-familiar ingredients like bantering criminal and/or crime-fighting buddies (Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg) a loathsome Mexican drug lord (Edward James Olmos) and a femme vitale and femme fatale rolled into one comely dame (Paula Patton). The movie takes a twisty road on its way to unveiling the usual plot about dueling intelligence agencies and personal betrayals but it isnt a scenic or exciting route. The one ""reveal"" Ill give away is that Washingtons Robert ""Bobby"" Trench is an undercover DEA officer and Wahlbergs Marcus ""Stig"" Stigman is an undercover Naval Intelligence officer. The movies biggest gimmick is that neither at first knows the others true identity. For a half hour or so you worry whether youre being asked to care about cutesy crooks who turn ordering breakfast and leaving a tip at a diner into farcical bonding routines. After that you wonder why they take more than one minute let alone twenty to join forces. Naturally they cement their friendship by beating and shooting each other. Blake Masters script adds several curlicues to Steven Grants comic book er pardon graphic novel. But it mostly makes do with shootouts stand-offs chases and explosions in scrubby landscapes and cities (the film was shot in New Mexico and Louisiana) along with ping-pong dialogue studded with catchphrases that will never catch on. Marcus when he isnt mangling words like ""misanthrope"" yammers endlessly about loyalty and codes until he states what passes for the movies moral ""Youre my people and we have a code. You fight for the guy thats fighting next to you."" Both Washington and Wahlberg are at their most amiable when theyre playing motor-mouths like these guys. Unfortunately their words here are pretty low-grade fuel. (Another routine that should be retired from action movies ""Whats your plan?"" ""I got a plan"") Even so the stars have more to work with than Patton or James Marsden (as Stigs superior officer). Olmos contributes one jamon turn as the cocaine kingpin and Bill Paxton as a loathsome CIA honcho is amusing when he seems to be imitating Bill Clintons voice - an impression that lasts maybe two minutes. The great Fred Ward is nothing but gruff as an admiral; Im glad he at least had an easy payday. Director Baltasar Kormakur delivers action thats brutal yet lacking in visceral force broad yet not distinct or clear enough to have any lasting impact. He takes resonant tropes from Walter Hill and Sam Peckinpah movies - notably the lowlife chicken shoot from Peckinpahs ""Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid"" - and reduces them to flimsy black comedy. His pacing is lickety-split and his stagecraft eye-catching but all it does is add an unwelcome layer of slick to pulp material. The rating may be R but the product is just greasy kids stuff.

"Review 2 Guns slick but Washington and Wahlberg grate - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review 2 Guns slick but Washington and Wahlberg grate 2 Guns Movie review by Kenneth Turan Kenneth Turan reviews 2 Guns starring Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan reviews 2 Guns starring Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic The only thing simple and direct about ""2 Guns"" is its title. This self-consciously nihilistic action movie is one slick piece of business as well as something of a double-edged sword.On one hand it can be briefly diverting to see Icelandic director Baltasar Kormakur and stars Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg use style and attitude to put a different spin on traditional genre plot dynamics in a story of misplaced drug money and mistaken identity. But its also true that the plot of ""2 Guns"" -- filled as it is with multiple feints dodges and mystifications -- is so tricky that events all but evaporate as soon as they happen. Though individual set pieces are well done the film inevitably leaves an empty taste behind it once its done.PHOTOS Summer Sneaks 2013 Written by Blake Masters and based on Steven Grants series of five graphic novels ""2 Guns"" throws us into the middle of a story then almost immediately tells us that everything we think we know about that story is completely wrong.Were introduced to Robert ""Bobby"" Trench (Washington) and Michael ""Stig"" Stigman (Wahlberg) a pair of wise-cracking hard guys whose glib patter is more irritating than amusing.Seated in a diner in a small Texas town theyre directly across the street from the Tres Cruces Savings amp; Loan a fiduciary establishment with ties to a Mexican drug cartel that they are fixing to rob.Just a week earlier however both men were south of the border trying to do a deal with the cartels leader ruthless Manny ""Papi"" Greco (Edward James Olmos). VIDEO Upcoming summer filmsNothing about Trench and Stigman as it turns out is as it seems including Trenchs strategically placed gold teeth. They are both undercover agents Trench for the Drug Enforcement Agency Stigman for U.S. naval intelligence. More than that neither one knows that the other guy is an agent.Even more baffling is the fact that this small-town savings amp; loan turns out to have more money in its vaults than either man anticipated. A whopping 40 million more which scares the pants off everyone involved including Trenchs DEA boss Deb Rees (Paula Patton) and Stigmans superior officer Lt. Cmdr. Quince (James Marsden).Not amused one little bit by the robbery is Earl (a nasty Bill Paxton) who shows up representing the owner of all that money an entity whose identity the film keeps secret for as long as it can. A man so scary he is known as ""Gods S.O.B."" Earl is beside himself when it turns out that no one including Trench and Stigman seems to know where that money they stole has disappeared to.Though they are both arrogant and antisocial these two guns are forced to cooperate in the face of Earls machinations if they want to stay alive in a world where you never know where you stand.It can be fun initially to see how director Kormakur who first came to international attention with expert Icelandic films such as ""101 Reykjavik"" and ""Jar City"" doles out this information to us with cinematic elan (helped by energetic persuasive editing by Michael Tronick). But this is not enough for the long haul particularly when Trench and Stigmans non-winning personalities and the films exploitative attitude toward women and violence are added into the mix. Slickness can take you only so far.kenneth.turanlatimes.com""2 Guns""MPAA rating R for violence throughout language and brief nudityRunning time 1 hour 49 minutesPlaying In general release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Movies 2 Guns Fiction Denzel Washington Mark Wahlberg Theft Guns of Summer With 2 Guns set to rule U.S. box office Smurfs 2 looks abroad 2 Guns triggers more action from buddies Wahlberg Kormakur Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad81deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-review-2-guns-20130802,0,5085291.story",200,2guns12,2guns,latimes

Patti Perret/Universal 2 Guns Director Baltasar Kormakur Genre Action Comedy Crime Running Time 109 minutes Rated R for violence throughout language and brief nudity With Denzel Washington Mark Wahlberg Edward James Olmos Paula Patton Hypermacho but tongue-in-cheek the first 20 minutes of 2 Guns are enormous fun. Tough guys Bobby and Stig (Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg) bicker and flirt -- with a pretty diner waitress and with each other -- while casing a small-town Texas bank. Then they set the diner on fire don masks and knock over the bank for 43 million all while taking care to save any cops from getting hurt and even kissing an available baby. The heist it would seem has gone according to plan. Yet somethings a little off. In fact nearly everythings a little off including the bulk of Blake Masters script (derived from a comics series written by Steven Grant). As the countdown-clock plot ticks toward its conclusion every tock moves the movie further into overplotted tedium. It turns out that though neither knows the others true identity both Bobby and Stig are not crooks but undercover agents and each is trying to use the other to snare a Mexican drug lord (Edward James Olmos). Bobby works for the DEA which is plausible while Stig toils for uh Naval Intelligence. Naval Intelligence targets Mexican drug cartels? Why not have Stig employed by the CIA? The movie does provide an answer to the latter question Bobby cant be CIA because the tale also has a role for that agency embodied by the purringly sadistic Earl (Bill Paxton). So the battle over the stolen 43 million becomes a four-way contest and thats not counting a few double-crossers. i Edward James Olmos plays the drug lord targeted in the intelligence operation that both of the films lead characters turn out to be connected to. Patti Perret/Universal Pictures hide caption toggle caption Patti Perret/Universal Pictures Edward James Olmos plays the drug lord targeted in the intelligence operation that both of the films lead characters turn out to be connected to. Patti Perret/Universal Pictures Stig reports to a by-the-rulebook officer (James Marsden) who may not apply the same rigor to his own behavior; Bobby to his colleague and sometime lover Deb (Paula Patton). Shes depicted nearly nude and with leering close-ups of her sexy bits in a hotel makeout-session scene so much like the one in Flight as to suggest that such moments are obligatory in any R-rated Denzel Washington movie. (Maybe theyre in the actors rider like Van Halens no-brown-Mamp;Ms directive?) Having betrayed each other Bobby and Stig are then forced to work together though theyre still inclined to quarrel. (During one dispute they roll around in the dirt punching as wildly as little boys.) The agents are constantly on the move with regular jaunts across the Mexican border all while being pursued by multiple varieties of thugs. One advantage of their being frantically and forever on the run is that the guys are constantly grabbing new cars trucks or dune buggies; they switch vehicles as often as the protagonists of a chick flick might change shoes. The action is helmed efficiently and with blessedly little CGI by Baltasar Kormakur who directed Wahlberg in Contraband but started by making arty little films in his native Iceland. Kormakurs work is well supported by Michael Tronicks taut editing and Clinton Shorters rousing if predictable ambient-blues score. The script is less propulsive and not just because its overstuffed with reversals and revelations. 2 Guns loses its charm amid multiple incidents of torture and brutality including animal cruelty and its attempt to riff on reports of CIA involvement in the drug trade just burdens a movie whose adolescent-daydream ideas about manliness arent terribly helpful as an approach to real-world issues. When two charismatic bad boys are being chased across the border by phalanxes of cops thugs and spies social commentary is just so much excess baggage.

Photo Everett Collection In ""2 Guns"" Mark Wahlberg is in the Navy Denzel Washington is a macho man and the two of them are obviously going to want a room together at the Y.M.C.A. but first they need to bitch their way through this cheerfully ridiculous movie. The pair of them are bantering freelance hoods working against a drug lord (Edward James Olmos) who has failed to deliver on a promise to supply them with cocaine. What Bobby (Washington) doesnt know is that Stig (Wahlberg) is an undercover agent for a naval investigative team that seems to have wandered far from the water. What Stig doesnt know is that Bobby is an undercover DEA agent ordered to take down Papi the drug baron (Olmos) by his boss and part-time lover (Paula Patton). Both men go rogue because of dirty deeds in their chains of command and have to dodge a fearsome villain (Bill Paxton) who wont say whom hes working for. So just go ahead and assume that everybody is trying to kill everybody and youll be relatively clear. ""2 Guns"" is a bag-of-money movie about a stash of 43 million that the lads steal from a bank after first kidnapping the local cops right in their own police station which sounds like the last place youd want to try to get away with waving a gun around. The boys are expecting only 3 million from the banks safe deposit boxes whose contents the DEA intends to use in a trial against the drug lord because getting a search warrant would have been a hassle. To whom we wonder does this massive stash belong? At first merely tangled the plot gradually turns baroque in its silliness This is the kind of movie that invites rude audience talkback and gets it. The shadowy merciless Earl (Paxton) captures Bobby demanding to know where the money is and threatening to shoot him. Bobby refuses to answer so Earl . . . lets Bobby go. What kind of a bad guy takes an insolent shrug for an answer? Later Bobby is wearing a Navy uniform while walking away from a building he has just blown up and no one seems to think it odd that this alleged officer is wearing a bushy goatee (verboten in the military). The real business of ""2 Guns"" is the camaraderie between the two bickering leads which looks a bit like flirting. They finish each others sentences order each others breakfast chat about ""Les Miserables"" and even stroll into the sunset arm in arm. During one friendly tiff Bobby and Stig nearly crash their pickups then reach into each others windows to lovingly pummel each other then get out and start rolling around on the ground in their jeans. This was the point where a lady behind me at the screening called out ""Why you just dont kiss?"" After the fight Stig says ""Come on you gotta admit that was kinda fun no?"" Oh and Stig hides a set of keys from Bobby by dropping them in his own underpants. ""You want em? Come and get em"" he calls out. Saucy saucy. Just to make things a bit more naughty an assassin thrusts a pistol up against Bobbys privates Stig surprises another agent by suddenly sliding his head on the ground between the mans legs with his face pointing straight up and the depraved Papi pees on his hands when preparing to torture the boys threatening to cut off each set of man-parts and place it in the other fellows mouth. Not every movie can come from the heart This one is from the crotch. But whats left for the sequel? Maybe itll feature Mark and Denzel sporting matching leather codpieces or giving each other bikini waxes. We can only hope.

VPC Claudia Puig USA TODAY 6 p.m. EDT August 1 2013The two leading men try their hardest to bring life to this forgettable shoot-em-up.Denzel Washington left and Mark Wahlberg play a pair of undercover officers in 2 Guns.(Photo Patti Perret Universal Pictures)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY review   out of fourStars Denzel Washington Mark Wahlberg Paula Patton Bill PaxtonRated R; Runtime 1 hour 49 minutes; Opens Friday nationwide 19 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 4 COMMENTEMAILMOREThousands of rounds of ammo are spent in 2 Guns a brutal complicated and sporadically funny movie that still seems slight.The saving grace of the film (  of four; rated R; opens Friday nationwide) is the chemistry between Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg as a pair of undercover lawmen who wend their way through a series of double triple and quadruple crosses. The scenes in which theyre riffing and tangling with each other bickering about pulling off a bank robbery plotting how to escape or bantering about what to order for breakfast are quite funny.Washington plays Robert ""Bobby"" Trench an undercover DEA agent and Wahlberg is Marcus ""Stig"" Stigman an undercover naval intelligence officer (Stigs back story has some glaring gaps). Their assignment is to infiltrate a drug cartel headed by kingpin Papi Greco (Edward James Olmos). Neither agent knows that the other is working undercover and that theyve been set up. In a small New Mexico town they rob a bank that they believe houses most of the cartels money. The expected take is about 3 million. But they make off with tens of millions more. Soon theyre wanted by a slew of characters from the Mob to the military to the CIA.PREMIERE Wahlberg tells Washington to lighten upSTORY 2 Guns creator unloads 3 Guns comic-book sequelREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersBill Paxton appears to be having a great time as the smarmy Earl a mysterious Southern-accented government operative with a penchant for Russian roulette. James Marsden plays a crooked Navy officer with clean-cut menace.Paula Patton plays Deb a DEA agent entangled occasionally with Bobby. Shes the only female character of any note -- the rest are extras and one waitress who utters a few sentences. Debs part in the complex scenario is key though her character is not well-developed. Mostly we see her romancing Bobby.The rest of the story is devoted to guns drugs and money. And an explosion or 10. Except for one scene in which the ostensible pair of heroic ""guns"" decide to waterboard Greco. Their plan is foiled but theyre disturbingly enthusiastic about the prospect. All the Latinos in the film are portrayed as either slimy players in the drug game or undocumented immigrants.Stig does a lot of flirting and winking but hes not allocated a romantic interest. Hes a sure shot but not exactly a smooth talker. In a frustrated moment he calls Bobby ""a misanthorpe"" and Bobby duly corrects his mispronunciation. More sparring ensues.Bobby and Stig could be playing an elaborate game of chess only whats at stake is their lives. The complex web theyre entangled in grows more intricate as the movie unfolds culminating in a rather anti-climactic Mexican standoff.The ultra-complicated plot doesnt mask the fact that this is a cynical and derivative movie based on the Boom graphic novels by Steven Grant. At least its briskly paced. But its story and gritty look give off a feeling of cinematic deja vu.By its conclusion the story has worked so hard to be twisting and clever that it runs out of steam and becomes outlandish marked by a surplus of violence -- too often casual and gratuitous -- for what essentially is a buddy cop movie. 19 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 4 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1ee0xCTSummer Movies Calendar AugustTake a look at the films heading to the box office this August complete with trailers reviews clips related stories and more.

"2 Guns | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; 2-guns ) 2 Guns (United States 2013) August 01 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli Fast pacing and a high energy level can cover a lot of sins and nowhere is that more evident that in 2 Guns. The storyline contains some ridiculous elements and the climax is more like a coalescence of chaos than a legitimate conclusion but it somehow works more often than not. The movie is loud fun quick moving and features some nice acting turns by Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg. Director Baltasar Kormakurs penchant for the offbeat (hes the Icelandic filmmaker behind 101 Reykjavik) is on display. Although Tony Scott is no longer with us this feels like the kind of film he might have championed. 2 Guns is about a pair of undercover agents neither of whom is aware of his partners real identity. Bobby Trench (Denzel Washington) is DEA and Stig (Mark Wahlberg) is Navy Intelligence but each thinks hes paired up with a legitimate crook. Their mutual goal is to take down cartel lord Papi Greco (Edward James Olmos). Their plan to do this which is never fleshed out in such a way that the audience can fully understand it has something to do with robbing a bank where Papis money is supposedly stashed in safe deposit boxes. After the robbery takes place however it comes to light that the stolen money belongs to the CIA and their enforcer (Bill Paxton) wants it back. Additional complications occur when Stigs commanding officer Quince (James Marsden) decides the money should be his and when Bobbys ex-girlfriend Deb (Paul Patton) becomes involved. The relationship between Bobby and Stig falls into the tried-and-true category of mismatched buddies. The chemistry between Washington and Wahlberg is adequate but not spectacular. These two wont go down in the annals of great screen pairings alongside the likes of Hope and Crosby or Lemon and Matthau. For that matter theyre not even up there with Pulp Fictions Travolta and Jackson. But theyll do in a pinch. The villains are suitably cartoonish - that applies to Bill Paxtons Earl Edward James Olmos Papi and James Marsdens Quince. None exudes much menace even when theyre doing extremely nasty things. Then theres Paula Pattons Deb whos more of a plot point than a character. Her big moment of self-reflection comes across as scripted and not terribly believable although the characters shortcomings are at least in part counterbalanced by a great scene of titillation. The action is over-the-top although when one considers the excess of films like Fast amp; Furious 6 it seems restrained. I guess the bar has moved. At any rate Kormakur has a knack for keeping things lively and 2 Guns sense of humor is certainly offbeat. Theres a snap-crackle-pop to the arguments between Washington and Wahlberg that prevents that relationship from becoming stale. However since theres not much in the way of genuine antagonism its never in doubt where things are going to end up. 2 Guns shouldnt be confused with anything more serious or high-minded than what it is. Its not intended to be a hard-hitting drama or an edge-of-the-seat thriller. In fact its more about the fractious yet fraternal relationship between the characters with the plot playing second fiddle. There are chases and shoot-outs and explosions but none of these are in any way extraordinary. Theres fun to be had in watching how Bobby and Stig survive a variety of seemingly inescapable mini-cliffhangers including a literal Mexican stand-off and something involving a pissed-off bull. The elements gel well enough to make 2 Guns an enjoyable cinematic experience but its not the kind of movie likely to be remembered with clarity once the ride home is done. 2 Guns (United States 2013) Director Baltasar Kormakur Cast Denzel Washington Mark Wahlberg Paula Patton Bill Paxton James Marsden Edward James Olmos Screenplay Blake Masters based on the graphic novels by Steven Grant Cinematography Oliver Wood Music Clinton Shorter U.S. Distributor Universal Pictures Run Time 149 U.S. Release Date 2013-08-02 MPAA Rating ""R"" (Violence Profanity Sexual Content Nudity) Genre THRILLER Subtitles none Theatrical Aspect Ratio 2.351 Comments Add Comment Three...better movies of this genre Jaws (1975) Pulp Fiction (1994) Casablanca (1943) worse movies of this genre Neon Demon The (2016) Left Behind (2014) Jade (1995) Three...better movies of Denzel Washington Glory (1989) Courage Under Fire (1996) Much Ado About Nothing (1993) worse movies of Denzel Washington Virtuosity (1995) Safe House (2012) Preachers Wife The (1996) Three...better movies of Mark Wahlberg Departed The (2006) Boogie Nights (1997) I Heart Huckabees (2004) worse movies of Mark Wahlberg Transformers Age of Extinction (2014) Happening The (2008) Invincible (2006) Three...better movies of Paula Patton Deja Vu (2006) Swing Vote (2008) Mission Impossible - Ghost Protocol (2011) worse movies of Paula Patton Mirrors (2008) Warcraft (2016) Idlewild (2006) ReelViews Library Currently in Cinema Writings Fictional Writings ReelThoughts Specials About Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions Contact Website credits",http://www.reelviews.net/php_review_template.php?identifier=2646,200,2guns16,2guns,reelviews

(AP Photo/Universal Pictures Patti Perret) Patti Perret This image released by Universal Pictures shows Paula Patton left and Denzel Washington in a scene from ""2 Guns."" (AP Photo/Universal Pictures Patti Perret) You may not have heard of a book called ""Save the Cat"" but every hack in Hollywood has.Its an idiot-proof cookbook for creating a potboiler with each plot point in the commercial-movie formula measured in microseconds. The buddy-cop comedy ""2 Guns"" might not be the most noxious crumb to fall off the assembly line but this bad boy has exceeded its expiration date by a lot more than 48 hours.Savvy filmgoers will know they are getting a stale product as soon as they see the wrapper one of those vintage muscle cars that screams ""stakeout."" In it is the salt-and-pepper combo of hothead Stig (Mark Wahlberg) and cool cat Bobby (Denzel Washington). Theyre casing a bank in a Texas border town yet theyve got the time and cojones to flirt with a waitress before torching her diner as a distraction. Then these charmers rob the bank and make off with millions. The recipe requires a twist and here the gimmick is that DEA agent Bobby and Naval Intelligence operative Stig dont know that the other guy is a cop too. They both think theyre rolling with a representative of Mexican drug lord Papi (Edward James Olmos). But then hidden corrupters shoot to kill and the die-hard frenemies find themselves running scared from men in black.The familiar ingredients include crooked feds (Bill Paxton and James Marsden) hot fuzz (Paula Patton) a head in a duffle bag (poor Little Tito) and implements of torture (Papis prized bull). This extended game of ""Wheres the Money?"" might be fun to play if director Baltasar Kormakur (""Contraband"") knew how to roll the dice but the action is as slow as rush hour in Beverly Hills. Its only shocking at the end of watch when lethal weapons are fired point blank at some wounded usual suspects. With the combined heat of its stars ""2 Guns"" should have had double impact but Washington and Wahlberg are only doing this tango for cash.What ""2 Guns""  Two stars out of four  Rating R  Run time 149  Content Violence strong language and brief nudity Joe Williams (joethecritic) is Post-Dispatchs film critic and author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

(Universal Pictures) By Ann Hornaday August 1 2013 Follow AnnHornaday Big guns cool cars tough talk and hats rule the day in ""2 Guns"" a cliche-ridden action comedy starring Mark Wahlberg and Denzel Washington in which the chemistry between the two stars packs far more heat than the explosions. Playing bank robbers with a hidden agenda -- a classic cake-and-eat-it scenario that allows the audience to root for the bad guys -- Wahlberg and Washington prove yet again why theyre among the most beloved male stars today as they bro-out and bang-bang their way into our hearts and each others. Still even with the proven charms of its leading men the degree to which you buy ""2 Guns"" depends on whether one year after the shooting in Aurora Colo. and seven months after Newtown you dont mind seeing guns used as props fetishes phallic symbols and most tastelessly jokes In the movies stylized hyper-violent world flesh wounds are tantamount to the offhanded one-liners the stars toss back and forth like so many verbal Frisbees. If the reckless gunplay is offensive the verbal repartee is too often stale One running gag has to do with police officers and doughnuts which was already hackneyed when ""The Simpsons"" first went on the air. Along with the slow-motion gun fights over-the-top truck chases brutal torture involving a baseball bat and an angry bull and an over-arching tone of crass cynicism ""2 Guns"" feels like its all been done before whether by John Woo Michael Bay or any number of their CGI-happy clones. What sets ""2 Guns"" director Baltasar Kormakur (""Contraband"") apart is that he has Wahlberg and Washington each doing what he does best Wahlberg playing the trusting over-eager puppy dog with the eyes of a sniper and Washington keeping it cool under an assortment of porkpie hats and shades. (The film was written by Blake Masters from a graphic novel series by Steven Grant.) The two are ably supported by Edward James Olmos Bill Paxton James Marsden Paula Patton and -- hello -- Fred Ward. But the sum of even those great parts winds up being just as disposable as so many of this summers boys-and-their-toys bullpucky. Admittedly though ""2 Guns"" contains at least one great line as one of the characters tells Patton ""I meant to love you."" Funny thats exactly how I felt about the movie. 1/2 R. At area theaters.

To read the whole story subscribe to BostonGlobe.com 2 Guns Share Comment Whats the old expression about putting lipstick on a pig? ""2 Guns"" a busy and bullet-riddled new action movie has some mighty fine lipstick but its still a porker. Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg play a pair of drug dealers who unbeknownst to each other at first are both undercover cops. The dialogue is cynical and often very funny and because the stars genuinely enjoy each others company ""2 Guns"" rollicks along nicely for a half-hour or so. But there are secondary characters and plotlines to torture cars to blow up and an underlying meanness that curdles the raffish high spirits.

Though its sometimes underdramatized this story of adolescents on the brink of adulthood is refreshingly and endearingly unlike the overheated features that have come to define the genre. Love and self-hate work at cross-purposes and the lovers may or may not forge a shared future. Theyre so appealing though that you want only the best for both of them. WSJ Film Critic Joe Morgenstern reviews The Spectacular Now a movie he says refreshingly and endearingly captures the brink of adulthood. The hero a high-school senior named Sutter Keely is played by Miles Teller. A charming swaggerer given to swigging from a hip flask Sutter likes to think of himself as the life of an endless party until hes jilted by his golden girlfriend Cassidy (Brie Larson). Mr. Teller taking zestful command of his first leading role is more of a surprise than Shailene Woodley whod already made a quietly remarkable feature debut two years ago as the older daughter in ""The Descendants."" This time she plays Aimee Finicky a classmate of Sutters who discovers him sprawled on her front lawn after a night of heavy boozing. If you found Ms. Woodleys previous performance as affecting as I did youll be glad to know that shes all the more so in a role that puts a premium on her gift for sweet guilelessness. Watch a clip from the film ""The Spectacular Now."" A hard-partying high school seniors philosophy on life changes when he meets the not-so-typical ""nice girl."" (Photo/Video A24 Films) Theyre a perfectly mismatched pair these two. Sutters devotion to living in the now conceals how deeply hes mired in the moment and how terrified he is of looking beyond it. ""This is the youngest were ever going to be"" Sutter says exuberantly but hes perilously immature and clearly headed for a fall. Aimee by contrast gives nice a good name makes innocence interesting. She is grounded in her own now a time of fascination and promise even if shes socially challenged and still has her dreamy side. Youre touched by her naivete when she speaks earnestly of her dreams at a family dinner given by Sutters sister ""My husband and I will live on a horse ranch and Ill work for NASA."" At the same time though theres reason to suspect that this smart and centered young woman could pull it off. ""The Spectacular Now"" handsomely photographed by Jess Hall was adapted from Tim Tharps novel by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber. Theyre the writers who came to prominence four years ago through their debut feature script for ""500 Days of Summer."" While that film found an appreciative audience it was more about style than substance an exhaustive and exhausting dissection of a relationship that wasnt all that promising in the first place. This new film sometimes falls into simplistic psychologizing; Sutters shriveled sense of himself is tied awfully tightly to his having been abandoned by his father ( Kyle Chandler impressive in a relatively small role.) Yet the script is genuinely felt--it helps to have a literary source--and enhanced at every turn by Mr. Ponsoldts expert direction. Expert and elastic--a directorial style that accommodates the flamboyance of Sutters partying and the delicacy of his early encounters with Aimee. (One lovemaking scene is almost startling for its tender simplicity.) However leisurely the pace the narrative derives suspense from Aimees vulnerability and Sutters heedlessness. We know what a treasure she is but does he? A good question posed by a good movie. Watch a clip from the film ""2 Guns."" A DEA agent and a naval intelligence officer find themselves on the run. While fleeing they learn the secret of their shaky alliance Neither knew that the other was an undercover agent. (Photo/Video Universal) 2 Guns When does banter turn to blather? In the case of this action adventure which was directed by Baltasar Kormakur its when you realize that keeping track of the barely fathomable plot isnt worth the bother. ENLARGE Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg Universal Pictures For quite a while lots of pleasantly fizzy language flows back and forth between Denzel Washingtons Bobby an undercover DEA agent and Mark Wahlbergs Stig an operative from naval intelligence. Thrown together to infiltrate a Mexican narcotics syndicate they punctuate an edgy mistrust of one another with banter about bank robbery fat cops donuts car theft and ordering breakfast from a pretty waitress in a scene lifted from ""Five Easy Pieces."" Both of these stars are blessed with the gift of gab and its enjoyable--for a while--to hear them working out their anxieties about each others loyalties and whether theres a code of honor to cover such situations. ""There is no code"" Bobby insists. Complications set in after a bank job goes wrong or rather goes dangerously right what with an unexpectedly vast heist of ominous provenance. Bobby and Stig not only mistrust one another but as it develops ever so murkily are setting one another up and end up being pursued by their respective agencies as well as by an infinitely corrupt and ruthless CIA. And the more their loyalties shift the more does blather become the movies dominant mode even though Mr. Kormakur stages a succession of action sequences that are satisfying in their own right and might be better still if they were part of a coherent whole. The cast includes Bill Paxton Paula Patton and Edward James Olmos. Blake Masters based the screenplay on the Boom Studios graphic novels by Steven Grant. If theres a code to the plot I never cracked it. Watch a clip from the film ""Europa Report."" An international crew of astronauts undertakes a privately funded mission to search for life on Jupiters fourth largest moon. (Photo/Video Magnet Releasing) Europa Report At a time when sci-fi often means hugely expensive enterprises with dazzling effects brought down by prosaic stories (anyone for another leaden helping of ""Prometheus"" or this summers ""After Earth"" or ""Pacific Rim""?) you want to root for low-budget productions that depend on ingenuity and imagination. (Anyone for the special pleasures of ""Another Earth"" or ""Moon""?) ""Europa Report"" had me solidly on its side going into the screening room. Shot on an extremely modest budget this indie feature combines found footage with ingeniously staged sequences to tell of a contemporary mission to Jupiters moon Europa where unmanned probes have suggested the possibility of single-celled life in oceanic waters beneath the satellites frozen surface. But the film lost me somewhere between its audacious use of ""The Blue Danube"" indelibly associated with Stanley Kubricks ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" and the discovery that life aboard the spaceship was visualized with flair but written with low-orbit banality. ENLARGE En route to Jupiter Magnet Releasing The first alarm was sounded by a single sentence ""This really is a new first step for mankind"" says Embeth Davidtzs Dr. Samantha Unger a mission control scientist commenting on the flight. As opposed to Neil Armstrongs old first step? Funny how an otherwise trivial slip can start you wondering if youre in good hands. Not so funny that the almost-convincing simulation of a mission in deep space can be seriously undercut by astrobabble--such questions one crew member intones as ""who are we why are we here where do we come from are we alone?""--and storytelling lapses. An astronaut on a space walk tears his glove then tries to save himself by covering the hole with his other glove. Thats not witty just silly. Jupiter comes and goes without any sense of the spaceship being clear of the planets orbit. Communication with Earth goes down then comes up again after a long agonizing time but we dont see the crews reaction at the moment the link is restored. A lot of resourceful and thoughtful work has gone into this film Eugenio Caballeros production design Enrique Chediaks cinematography distinctive performances by Michael Nyqvist and Anamaria Marinca. Whats missing though is a dimension beyond the literal. ""Another Earth"" and ""Moon"" transcended their financial and physical limitations with mystery and ambiguity. ""Europa Report"" goes ploddingly where bolder films have gone before. Rewind ENLARGE The Graduate The Graduate (1967) Instead of boy meets girl boy meets woman then gets girl. The high point of Mike Nicholss landmark comedy is the seduction scene in which Anne Bancrofts Mrs. Robinson brings Dustin Hoffmans Benjamin Braddock into the adult world. But that seduction is soon followed by an equally memorable scene almost two minutes long and accompanied by nothing but the sound of deep breathing. Its when Benjamin clad in scuba-diving gear and carrying a spear plunges into a swimming pool goes to the bottom and simply stands there trying to fathom his life. ENLARGE Devil in a Blue Dress Devil in a Blue Dress (1995) For all his splendid work over the years Denzel Washington has never given a finer performance than in this elegant thriller directed by Carl Franklin from a screenplay he based on the novel by Walter Mosely. The year is 1948 the place is Los Angeles and Mr. Washington as the self-taught private eye Easy Rawlins is looking for a mysterious beauty named Daphne Monet. Easy operates in a richly detailed black milieu that encompasses the jazz joints of Central Avenue and the residential neighborhoods of Watts where new homeowners tend their gardens and water their lawns. ENLARGE Solaris Solaris (1972) Not Steven Soderberghs 2002 remake but the classic original (or classic curiosity) by Andrei Tarkovsky with a running (or sauntering) time of 167 minutes. Mr. Tarkovsky had seen ""2001"" disliked its dehumanized style and devoted most of his screenplay to philosophical discussions that the films admirers find profound and its detractors consider ponderous. A cosmonaut (Donatas Banionis) is sent on a mission to a distant space station but the voyage that concerns us takes place inside the recesses of his brain and soul. Fridrikh Gorenshtein and the director based the screenplay on a novel by Stanislaw Lem.

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Two criminals each unaware that the other is an undercover agent run afoul of both sides of the law. (Rated R) BOTTOM LINE An uneven mix of strong violence and weak comedy but Washington and Wahlberg use their natural-born charm to pull us through the wreckage. CAST Denzel Washington Mark Wahlberg Paula Patton Bill Paxton LENGTH 141 A low bar is cleared though with some difficulty by ""2 Guns"" a buddy-cop movie that would never work without the top-notch talents of Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg. Its a jumbled film with a lazy plot and poorly sketched action sequences but the natural charm of its two stars along with some colorful bit players may put you in a forgiving mood. Washington plays Bobby Trench an easygoing unflappable drug dealer whose partner in crime is Marcus Stigman played by an amped-up trash-talking Wahlberg. Theyve developed a comfortable camaraderie bickering affectionately before during and after each shootout. You know them well moviegoers and ""2 Guns"" wont force to you rethink any cliches. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless Comedy Central upset over use of fake Colbert? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Messing Shelton call truce after spat over Trump Matt Damon says hes taking a year-long acting break The wrinkle is that each is working undercover -- Bobby with the Drug Enforcement Agency Stigman with Naval Intelligence -- which the other realizes only after their latest caper goes horribly awry. In short order theyre pursued by Navy assassins (led by a sneering James Marsden) a Mexican drug lord (an earthy Edward James Olmos) and a sadistic good ol boy named Earl (an excellent Bill Paxton) who uses both bullets and thumbtacks to extort information. ""2 Guns"" is energetically directed by Baltasar Kormakur -- a welcome change from ""Contraband"" his dull vehicle for Wahlberg last year -- but he hews to so many conventions that his film cant establish its own personality. Its violence is mostly flashy but occasionally ugly as when flies circle a severed head in a satchel. The humor is tepid Stigmans shtick is winking at waitresses Trench has a fondness for doughnuts. Paula Patton as Bobbys sort-of girlfriend provides a moment of genuine emotion but it feels misplaced in this otherwise depthless macho fantasy. Still Washington cuts a cool figure in his dark shades and jaunty hat and Wahlberg always looks impressive hoisting a shiny pistol. As they saunter through this rickety movie with confidence and ease you might have a fairly good time just following them. 304 Movies2 Guns trailer PLOT Two criminals each unaware that the other is an undercover agent run afoul of both sides of the law. advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING R (violence throughout language brief nudity) CAST Denzel Washington Mark Wahlberg Paula Patton Bill Paxton.

Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated Wednesday July 31 2013 235 PM Title 2 Guns Film Info With Denzel Washington Mark Wahlberg Narcotics operatives join forces to bring down a Mexican drug lord. Director Baltasar Kormakur (149). R Violence language nudity. Area theaters. Pure charisma is sometimes the best special effect. Thats what Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg bring to ""2 Guns"" and after a season full of superhero duds they deliver a crucial dose of cool. Theres more to the story than just their repartee. Yet to director Baltasar Kormakurs credit he clearly saw he lucked into a great wisecrackin trigger-finger team and he gets out of their way. ""2 Guns"" launches as an easygoing duel between Washingtons Bobby and Wahlbergs Stig as they plan a small-time bank robbery in Mexico. Theyre pros at this but the heist gets weird when the 3 million they thought would be there winds up being 43 million. That throws them as Bobby and Stigs image of drug lord Papi Greco (Edward James Olmos) whose money they lifted was of a lower cartel boss in the middle of coke-and-illegal-passport deals. While evading an overzealous CIA agent (Bill Paxton) Stig and Bobby get picked up by the Feds. Thats when Bobby -- whose last name changes with the day -- is revealed to be a DEA agent working for his ex-girlfriend (delicious Paula Patton). Stig whos been running drugs with Bobby for only a short time has a secret too hes ex-U.S. Navy working undercover. When they learn of each others covert ops they try to outthink both the cartel and the CIA which wants the 43 mil for their own reasons. Blake Masters busy script becomes simply a wind-up mechanism for the stars to click into. Thats fine since Kormakur (who made ""Contraband"" with Wahlberg) has his priorities straight. There are top-notch set pieces including a tense interrogation conducted by a sneering Paxton (a real kick with his bolo tie and Southern-drip drawl) a fast-moving break-in at a Naval base and an epic Mexican standoff. Denzel Washington and Paula Patton in ""2 Guns"" But this is Washington and Wahlbergs show. Washington can still be fierce but is most fun when hes half-hepcat and half sleeping-tiger as he is here. Wahlberg can be great in the right projects and this is one of them. His furrowed brow camouflages everyguy strength; Stig acts oafish until its time to sharpen up and use his expert sharpshooter skills. As a team Washington and Wahlberg keep the riffs going as this action-comedy shimmers and builds to a terrifically entertaining heat haze. Then the bullets fly almost as fast as their mouths and everything hits its target.

DEA agent Denzel Washington and naval intelligence man Mark Wahlberg attempt to evade mayhem in ""2 Guns"" a mess of an action thriller. Photo Universal Pictures 2 Guns review An off-putting violent mess 1 / 1 Back to Gallery 2 Guns Action. Starring Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg. Directed by Baltasar Kormakur. (R. 109 minutes.) ""2 Guns"" is a lighthearted action movie with a high body count including a few dead chickens. The chicken scene comes about 10 minutes in and it either depicts a scene of animal cruelty in a jolly way - or its an example of genuine animal cruelty on its own. Hard to say which. The setup is that four or five chickens are buried in the ground up to their necks and some sadistic slobs are shooting at them. The bullets are missing them by inches and theyre flinching though with computer graphics these days who knows whats real and whats not? Then Mark Wahlberg who has been berating the other men for animal cruelty demonstrates his skill with a gun by quickly blowing off the head of each chicken - and that last dead chicken? That looked real. The interlude sets the tone for ""2 Guns"" in ways that Icelandic director Baltasar Kormakur probably never quite realized. It establishes that the filmmakers think stuff is funny that isnt and it welcomes the audience to a brutal and stupid experience. But thats not the worst. No stupid brutality is simply this movies chronic illness - the fatal one is a story that seems made up on the spot and creates no reason to keep watching. This is where having movie stars helps. See Denzel Washington doing his famous rolling walk down the street and suddenly pleasant associations from other better Denzel movies spring to mind. To a lesser but respectable extent the same might be said for Mark Wahlberg. The impulse is to care about these guys and so ""2 Guns"" gets a whole lot of benefit as it creates a whole lot of doubt. Finally after about an hour every last ounce of audience goodwill evaporates and the actors are left stumbling through the arid desert of the screenplay. At its heart there is a single almost-good idea Washington and Wahlberg are a couple of shady characters who team up for a major heist each not knowing that the other isnt really a crook. Bobby (Washington) is a DEA agent and Stig (Wahlberg) works for naval intelligence. They team up to rob a bank because they want to put the squeeze on a big-time gangster who has 3 million on deposit there. In fact they walk away with 47 million a troubling sum of money. A word about the gangster who is played by Edward James Olmos. You know how they keep track of his comings and goings? They park outside his house and watch. Thats funny. When I was a kid I lived fairly near the mob boss Paul Castellano who had high fences and cameras and guards everywhere. Guys like that try not to make it easy for their enemies. The heist brings about a whole set of complications and it takes the rest of the movie to sort them out. The story has an improvisatory feeling with one problem piled on another which could have been all right except that the screenwriters forgot the first rule of action movies No matter how complex the story gets the protagonists motives have to be simple and compelling. ""2 Guns"" tangles itself up by giving each protagonist a different motive and even when they join forces they have little reason to do what they do. Basically they just want to survive which is the weakest motive because its defensive not active. Yes it can work if the whole story is about someone constantly being attacked but if the protagonists are the ones doing the attacking audiences need more. They dont get it here. In ""2 Guns"" they dont even get a rooting interest. Bill Paxton plays a lethal evil CIA agent - hes the best thing here all-American and twisted. Paula Patton is perfectly lovely as a DEA agent but try as she might she cant make sense of her role. No one could have. Kormakur tries to cover over the plot deficiencies by making the violence just a little more real and a little more nasty and by making the scenes a little more zany than expected. But if you want to see a movie go out of control pay attention to the climactic scene of ""2 Guns."" Its a complete mess the spectacle of filmmakers blowing up their movie and everything in it because they cant think of anything else to do. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

More about 2 Guns >> And its true that in this slam-bang adaptation of a graphic novel about dueling undercover agents the two stars riff wrestle and crack wise as though they genuinely enjoy each others company. They like each other and we like em for it - Wahlberg shamelessly winking at waitresses and acting like a knucklehead (he mangles highfalutin words like ""misan-thorp"") Washington oozing jazzbo cool with his goatee gold-capped canines dark shades and Panama hat. Too bad the vehicle they find themselves in - or vehicles (a Dodge muscle car a vintage Mercedes wagon various SUVs and a fleet of other ""borrowed"" wheels) - is so pointlessly nastily violent. Animals and people get their heads blown off for the sake of a bad joke and Bill Paxton as one of the movies heavies rolls his revolver in his hand making ominous inquiries about Russian roulette and his captives familiarity with same. Then bang. Sure if the movie is called 2 Guns you should expect an army of stuntmen firing off rounds of ammo squibs exploding. But Paxtons sociopathic G-man and even more so Edward James Olmos Mexican druglord Papi Greco belong in something darker and creepier than this. Director Baltasar Kormakur (he trotted Wahlberg through his paces in last years Contraband too) stages his chases and shoot-em-ups with flair but if hes trying to pull off a Tarantino-esque juggling act (hip irony one minute ugly carnage the next) it doesnt work. Even the obliging Paula Pattons topless scene - shes Washingtons characters kind-of girlfriend - has a voyeuristic exploitive smarm about it. Shot in New Orleans and New Mexico (looks like the same patch of desert the Breaking Bad gang wanders around) 2 Guns is a spinning wheel of double-crosses and triple-crosses in which Wahlbergs Michael Stigman and Washingtons Bobby Trench also known as Bobby Beans suspect each other of being a crook a drug runner a bank heister when in fact they are both undercover agents working for separate outfits Stigman with Navy Intel Bobby with the DEA. Ultimately they figure that out. They also figure out that their respective bosses havent been straight with them. Theres a deep current of cynicism running through 2 Guns - if it has to do with the government it cant be trusted. Theres also a running gag about cops and doughnuts as the duo make plans to rob a small-town savings and loan where they think Greco has been stashing millions in a safe deposit box. With border crossings and familiar buddy-cop movie tropes (think Lethal Weapon think 48 HRS think The Heat) the Wahlberg-Washington express hits lots of comfortably familiar notes. And more than a few viciously uncomfortable ones too. 2 Guns 1/2 (Out of four stars) Directed by Baltasar Kormakur.

Because it stars Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg thats why. Their chemistry in a sort of anti-buddy film carries director Baltasar Kormakurs ""2 Guns."" You could do far worse than watch Washington and Wahlberg bicker for a couple of hours pausing every now and then to plug somebody. Throw in a little serious scenery chewing from Bill Paxton and Edward James Olmos at their most bad-ass and hey why not? We first see Bobby Trench (Washington) and Stig Stigman (Wahlberg) as theyre setting up a small-town bank robbery. It involves a restaurant with the best doughnuts in three counties and a lot of back-and-forth patter. They want what they think is the 3 million inside belonging to Papi Greco (Olmos) the drug-cartel boss theyve been working for. Only not really. Almost none of that is true. For one thing there isnt 3 million in the bank. More like 40 million-plus. More important Bobby actually is an undercover DEA agent. Stig is a Navy undercover intelligence officer. Neither knows this about the other and Kormakur lets that ignorance play out longer than youd expect. The levels of intrigue go deep enough (too deep really) that none of this really is spoiler material. It just sets the story in motion. Of course you dont steal that kind of money without a few people noticing. These people include Bobbys fellow DEA agent (and former girlfriend) Deb (Paula Patton) Stigs boss Quince (James Marsden) and a mysterious sadistic man named Earl (Paxton) whose identity figures into just one of the many double-crosses and plot twists which are fun for a while but eventually pile on to the point of distraction. Bobby and Stig figure out each others true identities and form what is supposed to be an uneasy alliance but instead is an adorably chummy relationship between two guys whose obvious affection wouldnt get in the way of shooting each other if the situation called for it. Bobby is the sharp-dressing silent type (we rarely see him without a hat) while Stig is more of a T-shirt-wearing act-first think-later guy. Sometimes this leads to stupid decisions such as taking on an entire Navy base. Its screamingly implausible but by this point your investment in the characters is likely to be enough to let that slide. That Blake Masters screenplay is based on a graphic novel will come as no surprise. In some ways ""2 Guns"" is a throwback refreshingly so. Its all banter and bullets without a lot of heavy meaning beyond the usual friendship trust etc. You realize at some point that you know almost nothing about any of the characters beyond whats immediately in front of us. But Kormakur keeps the action so relentless that it takes awhile to notice. Again Wahlberg and Washington are so good together quips flying as fast as lead that much is forgiven. Its all good fun. But theres one scene that gives us a glimpse of how ""2 Guns"" could have been more. Its when Earl whose preferred method of making people talk is a form of Russian roulette sits down to confront Bobby. Washington is of course a great actor who makes his characters preternatural calm seem effortless even when we know theyre faking it (see last years ""Flight"" for a good example). Paxton also is outstanding if somewhat underrated another actor with a quiet facade masking inner turmoil. When they face off here the tension is exquisite. Alas the rest of ""2 Guns"" isnt. But its not bad a buddy film that never quite becomes something more but at least it tries to be. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebookfacebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

"2 Guns movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Guns in sure hands  1/2Washington Wahlberg among the pros supporting a thin action scriptJuly 31 2013|Michael Phillips | Movie criticDenzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg in 2 Guns. (Patti Perret/Universal Pictures)Taken from a graphic novel ""2 Guns"" has this much in common with Woody Allens ""Blue Jasmine"" Theyre both about characters hung out to dry. Also the stars in both films lend panache and a sense of purpose to familiar-seeming material. Beyond that the differences are significant. ""Blue Jasmine"" is the movie with the old-time jazz on the soundtrack; ""2 Guns"" is the one with people getting shot in the leg the arm the head the chest or somewhere else and with Paula Patton in a nude scene that brings a hush of prayerlike gratitude from a mostly male audience.Denzel Washington above left and Mark Wahlberg above right provide the stardom. Theyre two of the most reliable relatable action heroes in American movies today. In ""2 Guns"" the company they keep on screen is solid thanks to Bill Paxton as a vicious CIA operative after the millions stolen from a New Mexico bank; Edward James Olmos as a drug lord after the same; James Marsden as a U.S. Naval Intelligence officer after the same. Paxton in particular registers strongly; with his twitty little mustache tiny little hats and blood-curdling interrogation methods he appears to be channeling a villainous passel of character actors (a little John Hillerman a lotta Warren Oates) from films past.The setup Washingtons character who goes by Bobby Beans (what is this ""Rango""?) may look and act like a garden-variety bank robber but hes really an undercover Drug Enforcement Agency op trying to bring down the Mexican drug cartel ruled by Olmos Papi Greco. He doesnt realize (and vice versa) that his partner Stig Stigman (Wahlberg) is likewise no common thief. Hes a U.S. Naval Intelligence officer undercover and gunning for Greco.Already this is getting twisty. ""2 Guns"" comes from a BOOM Studios series of comics written by Steven Grant and drawn by Mateus Santolouco. In its original form the story is diverting facile stuff. The same can be said of the film version adapted freely by Blake Masters and directed by Baltasar Kormakur whose career spans Icelandic-language dramas and English-language thrillers among them ""Contraband"" starring Wahlberg.He has talent this director ""2 Guns"" isnt necessarily my thing (the jokey sadism is a drag) but Kormakur lays out an action sequence with a swiftness and a coherence missing from many other pictures. The movies a demonstration of two overlapping brands of narrative cynicism Its depiction of a vast CIA-fueled and drug-funded conspiracy is pure early 21st century but in many of the particulars ""2 Guns"" harks back to the smaller-scale amoral thrillers of the post-Watergate 1970s studio era. The 1973 Don Siegel film ""Charley Varrick"" is a major reference point with the bank robberies in both films taking place in fictional Tres Cruces N.M. Cinematographer Oliver Wood goes for brightly lit compositions steering clear of faux-documentary realism in his lighting. The bantering stars remain front and center throughout. The psychology if you can call it that regarding the characters motivations and entanglements is paper thin the Achilles heel of the typical graphic novel-derived action film. The actors -- including Patton as Bobbys DEA colleague and sometime fling -- cannot act what is not there. But with Washington Wahlberg Olmos and Paxton around jockeying for dominance the standoffs have their moments.mjphillipstribune.com2 Guns - 2 1/2 starsMPAA rating R (for violence throughout language and brief nudity)Running time 148Opens Friday MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated Articles2 Guns adds producer Norton Herrick Denzel Washington...August 1 20122 Guns Kormakur Set To Climb EverestAugust 6 2013Baltasar Kormakur Chats About Everest Vikings and On...January 31 2014Bill Paxton holsters up Two Guns Will co-star with Mark...June 13 2012Marsden enlists for Two Guns Will play naval commander...June 26 2012Find More Stories AboutMark WahlbergDenzel WashingtonBlue JasmineTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0731-2-guns-20130731,0,5294510.column",200,2guns26,2guns,chicagotribune

If were being honest Baltasar Kormakurs ""2 Guns"" beats present-day Hill at his own game what with its endless banter bloody shootouts and requisite quadruple-crosses. This is a cable staple in the making and I do mean that as a compliment. The chief ingredients here are 2 leads Mark Wahlberg and Denzel Washington pairing well together as Michael Stigman and Bobby Trench a couple of low-level hustlers cozying up to Mexican drug lord Papi Greco (Edward James Olmos). Theyve decided to rob a small bank north of the border where Papi regularly stashes cash but when they expect around 3 million to split between them Mike and Bobby find themselves carting away 43.1 million for their troubles. Theres one big hiccup though and if youve seen the trailers by now then you know whats what Bobby is DEA Michael works for Naval Intelligence and neither knows the other is undercover. Naturally a reluctant partnership ensues when each man finds himself framed by their superiors and were spared the culture-clash B.S. because weve already seen that both can work together when its in their best interests. ""Dont Kumbaya me"" Bobby says deflating the token ebony-and-ivory jokes early and well. No Blake Masters screenplay (based on Steven Grants graphic novels) finds other ways to keep things funny if not necessarily fresh. We shouldnt be surprised to learn that corruption knows no bounds or that Bobbys love interest (Paula Patton Washingtons ""Deja Vu"" co-star) will become a bargaining chip. Frankly the formula is besides the point; even when theyre at odds Wahlberg and Washington are a perfect hot-cold mix and the supporting ranks are filled out nicely by sturdy character actors like Olmos Fred Ward and Bill Paxton whos clearly having the most fun of all with tracking down his targets. Furthermore ""2 Guns"" is by every measure a brighter film than his ""Contraband"" was a Tex-Mex neo-Western that embraces its Southwestern setting to pull off robberies kidnappings and the impromptu siege of a military base out of which our heroes find a suitably explosive means of escape. Even with four parties on Bobby and Michaels tail at any given time the motives are always apparent (if not outright identical -- the 43.1 million should have given that away) and the cynicism towards various government agencies is equally felt. The month of August has long struggled to shake its reputation as the summer doldrums home to the occasional ""District 9"" or ""Inglourious Basterds."" However in a season stuffed with empty eye candy ""2 Guns"" comes along as something of a welcome burrito -- plenty satisfying and hardly nutritious.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg are great company. Youd want to have a beer with them trade war stories and laugh your ass off. But thats a fantasy. The only way you get to hang with these two big guns is to see 2 Guns and its not a fair trade-off. Icelandic director Baltasar Kormakur who worked with Wahlberg on 2012s Contraband knows how to move action along. Hes so good at it that you believe the tired old B-movie plot might actually spring to life and relevance. No such luck. What can I say about the story? That Washingtons Bobby Trench and Wahlbergs Stig Stigman rob banks together. I could say that but it wouldnt be true exactly. And if I say any more Ill be pilloried for being a spoiler sport. So Ill say this the supporting cast especially Bill Paxton and Edward James Olmos as baddies comes up aces. So does Oliver Woods sleek cinematography. But you cant tell me a B-movie cant be exciting and smart. Why? Because Washington and Ethan Hawke proved it could be Antoine Fuquas Training Day. Washington has a nice noirish line to his romantic interest a cop played sexily by Paula Patton ""I really meant to love you."" Hell I really meant to at least like 2 Guns. But I couldnt.

"2 Guns a buddy cop flick that hits the mark review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMovies2 Guns a buddy cop flick that hits the mark reviewDenzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg makes 2 Guns that rare thing an enjoyable summer blockbuster.By Bruce DeMaraEntertainmentThu. Aug. 1 20132 GunsStarring Denzel Washington Mark Wahlberg. Directed by Baltasar Kormakur. 109 minutes. At major theatres. 14AThe opening shot features a train barrelling down the track towards you the audience.Its an apt metaphor for the film that follows -- big noisy and fast -- and if you enjoy train trips (and action movies) youre almost certainly going to like 2 Guns. Article Continued BelowOh yeah and the train stays on the tracks much like the film which gets us from point A to point B in a journey that while predictable is a breezily pleasant ride.Credit here is largely due to the casting of two appealing actors in the lead roles Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg. They play two reluctant partners thrown together when a bank heist goes awry and they have to figure out exactly what the heck is going on.The chemistry works between the two with Washington playing Bobby ""Beans"" Trench and Wahlberg his partner Marcus ""Stig"" Stigman.Both are working undercover to bring down a Mexican drug kingpin though neither knows the other isnt who he says he is. Trench has a penchant for porkpie hats and uses a couple of fake gold-capped teeth to bolster his gangsta image. Stigman likes to chew gum and has a habit of winking at people usually women which Trench finds rather annoying.As the story opens the two are sitting at a diner a popular hangout for the local fuzz and planning to rip off the nearby Tres Cruces Savings and Loan.""Never rob a bank across from a diner with the best doughnuts in three counties"" Trench sagely observes. So they torch the place only to return a week later to knock over the bank.Thats when things get hairy because the 3 million or so in drug money theyre expecting to find is actually about ten times that amount and the people they thought they could trust are not exactly playing things straight.A mayhem-filled road trip ensues and a bevy of villains emerges including a corrupt navy officer named Quince (played by James Marsden) drug czar Papi Greco (played by Edward James Olmos) and a twitchingly sadistic CIA operative named Earl (played with edgy verve by Bill Paxton). Theres also a DEA agent love interest of Trenchs named Deb (played by Paula Patton).While the secondary actors all acquit themselves well it is the interplay between Trench and Stigman that occupies most of the screen time and our attention. Both actors have previously demonstrated their charisma and presence onscreen so it isnt a huge surprise that we like them both even as they squabble with each other on their way to becoming an effective team.The screenplay by Blake Masters -- based on the graphic novels of Boom Studios Steven Grant -- is perhaps a bit too murky and complicated. But this is a minor consideration.Iceland-born director Baltasar Kormakur demonstrates hes got the chops to play in the big-time Hollywood league both in assembling a very capable cast and in overseeing an enjoyable buddy cop action film with some interesting visuals and the odd surprise tossed in.The studios Universal Pictures and TriStar Pictures have spared little expense in promoting the film hoping to ensure 2 Guns succeeds where other recent summer blockbusters have failed. Their efforts are likely to be rewarded.

I dont think this movies an afterthought; I know it is because it has two of Hollywoods biggest male stars and probably cost well over 100 million to produce and market and here it is being released in August after all the summers big hits (and major flops) have come and gone. At some point Universal Pictures bigwigs grasped that ""2 Guns"" would never be famous or memorable or launch a new salt-and-pepper action franchise in the ""Lethal Weapon"" vein so now theyre hoping for one good weekend out of this sucker along with the likelihood that international box office will nudge the whole thing into the black eventually.I never would have gone to see this movie on my own initiative and my own 12. (Or even my own 6 at the charming second-run theater in upstate New York where ""2 Guns"" will no doubt end up in a couple of weeks.) But Im here to tell you that taken on its own moronic terms - which include helicopters crashing into a field (ka-whoppa-whoppa-whoppa boom) homoerotic banter egregious Mexican stereotypes and implausibly hot female DEA agents - ""2 Guns"" is both enjoyable trash and a fascinating snapshot of Hollywoods current mentality when it comes to the United States government. Ive written about this before (regarding the ""Bourne"" franchise for instance) but the default setting in thrillers these days is that institutions formerly portrayed as heroic like the military or the intelligence agencies are evil corrupt and pathologically nuts until and unless proven otherwise.Sure you can argue that ""2 Guns"" is an anomalous case since it was adapted by screenwriter Blake Masters from a somewhat alt-flavored graphic novel by Steven Grant and because director Baltasar Kormakur is an Icelandic art-house refugee who has been trying (and failing) to become an A-list Hollywood director for some years now and probably has crypto-Marxo-Muslim sympathies or whatever. Its safe to say ""2 Guns"" will not be making the list of ""wholesome family-friendly movies and inspiring movies with Christian faith and values"" published every year by Hollywood evangelist Ted Baehr. (This years semi-desperate Ted Baehr fave-raves include ""Despicable Me 2"" ""Fast amp; Furious 6"" ""which ends with a prayer to Jesus Christ"" and ""The Conjuring"" in which the Salem witches are revealed to be real Satan-worshipers after all 320 years later. To which I say Whatever)My actual point is that in the wake of Abu Ghraib and waterboarding and Bradley Manning and Edward Snowdens ever more alarming NSA revelations even a mindless shoot-em-up like ""2 Guns"" has to have a completely cynical attitude toward power if it wants to seem even vaguely hip. I am now going to issue a spoiler on ""2 Guns"" discussing a plot twist that is included in the trailers and the IMDB synopsis and revealed within the first 20 minutes of the movie. Please dont let that stop you from being outraged. You see the two bank-robbing badasses in ""2 Guns"" pork-pie-hat-wearing gold-toothed Bobby (Washington) and flirtatious good-ol-boy Stig (Wahlberg manfully trying to twist his native Boston accent in a Lone Star direction) are both undercover agents each unaware of the others true identity. Ha You see where this is going right? Theyve each been instructed to entrap the other guy in a big heist at a small-town Texas bank which is supposed to yield a few million bucks belonging to a Mexican drug lord who is honest-to-Pete named Papi (Edward James Olmos with a face like a gravel road and a wardrobe borrowed from Colonel Sanders). You Might Also Like Instead Bobby and Stig bickering the whole time in adorable ebony-and-ivory style get away clean with a much much larger pile of money that appears to belong to someone scarier than Papi. This was not the plan or at least it wasnt their plan. All Papis going to do after you double-cross him is have you beheaded and dumped in the desert which makes him seem positively snuggly next to the twitchy unctuous super-spook played by Bill Paxton who combines George W. Bushs manner and Dick Cheneys brain. Paxton single-handedly pushes the whole movie into low-budget early-80s Walter Hill-John Milius territory -- among other things by getting to say the line (to Olmos) ""Your cock is massive. Im in awe of your cock. But youre still a drug dealer and Im still the United States government."" Its a role that could once have been filled by Powers Boothe or Michael Ironside or for that matter by Fred Ward who has a satisfying cameo here as a Navy admiral who absolutely positively does not give a crap. Yes Paxton is that good. Add up all the gratuitous dead bodies and car chases and a supporting cast that includes Paxton Olmos Ward James Marsden (as a psychopathic jarhead type) and the shameless eye candy of ""Mission Impossible - Ghost Protocol"" star Paula Patton as a DEA agent who spends most of her screen time modeling intimate apparel and this whole project feels like an expensive homage to the B movies of another era. To be slightly more precise Kormakur is trying to split the difference between a macho action movie and a ""macho action movie."" He wants to make a big hit with big stars and punk the studio with an anti-American satire. It doesnt entirely work which is no big surprise but if youre craving some irresponsible and amoral old-school August cinema with no redeeming social value beyond the message that our government has gone insane and were all totally screwed you wont be let down.

Steak? ... Stick ... No Stig ... Stig? That it was difficult to ascertain a piece of information as basic as the name of Mark Wahlbergs character surely says something about this confusing mess of a movie. (The credits read ""Marcus Stig Stigman"" but you can understand my confusion what with all those beefy Wahlbergian muscles.) In this buddy flick Wahlberg capably plays the hammy wacky partner to Denzel Washingtons cooler tough-guy cop Bobby Trench. Theyre cute together these two big stars but the film around them a sort of Tarantino lite is desperately empty. Tracing its lineage back to the Lethal Weapon series 2 Guns presents what might be the most cynical assortment of bad guys ever gathered in a single film. Stig and Bobby are working undercover posing as drug dealers but neither knows the truth about each others motives. Bobby works for the DEA and hes trying to bring in a Mexican drug kingpin named Papi Greco (Edward James Olmos). Steak er Stig -- whom Papi describes accurately as a ""real junkyard dog"" -- used to be a naval intelligence officer. Booted for some infraction he wants to steal Papis profits to clear his Navy record. I tried hard to be attentive but still couldnt tell you how this is all explained maybe because so much of the movies exposition tends to be delivered through loud (and distracting) exchanges of gunfire. While Bobby and Stig cant trust each other they do need each other -- just like Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith but without the sexual tension. To complicate matters further after Bobby and Stigs successful heist the CIA comes calling. It seems the stolen stash actually belongs to the CIA which has been skimming 7% of all the drug kingpins cash and putting it in a community bank in a nice quiet little corner of Americana. Ill believe a lot of negative fictions about the CIA -- look at the way the agency treats Homelands tortured genius Carrie Mathison -- but the CIA angle in 2 Guns was the tipping point to despair. (The kind of despair where you think Of all the scripts out there the great Denzel Washington was drawn to this.) The agency is represented by Earl (Bill Paxton) a heavily accented Southerner who likes to wear bolo ties and suits with a cowboy cut to them. Hes vicious heartless and fond of playing Russian roulette. Problem is its Bill Paxton Has anyone ever been truly afraid of Bill Paxton? (MORE TIMEs Review of Denzel Washingtons Flight) There is but one woman in this movie a DEA agent and occasional lover of Bobbys named Debbie (Paula Patton). Patton is a perfectly fine actress but the way shes used here is relentlessly crass. In a scene that stretches the limits of hairstyling she appears topless but thanks to the extensions cascading over her shoulders almost discreetly so. You can imagine the clause in her contract nipples yes but only if theyre nearly veiled by hair a la Brooke Shields in her Blue Lagoon days. Director Baltasar Kormakur (who also directed Wahlberg in the much-less-tedious Contraband) employs a number of techniques to try to keep the viewer engaged including disorienting flashbacks and jazzy slow-motion moments that turn into freeze-frames but his source material is so weak it becomes a real effort to keep up. The action sequences -- there are enough guns in this movie to make the NRAs Wayne LaPierre weak in the knees -- are drearily unexceptional. This could be any buddy flick made in the past five years with the chemistry between Washington and Wahlberg offering the only flicker of excitement. And thats not saying much. A couple of handsome middle-aged guys exchanging wry glances and wisecracks between wrestling matches and aiming guns at each other only goes so far. By the time Bobby and Stig are hog-tied and dangled to be beaten with baseball bats like a pair of hunky pinatas their mutual suspicions have evolved to no ones surprise into a full-blown bromance. Perhaps it says something that this movie is being released in August which has become a notorious dumping ground for studios. 2 Guns is reflective of the low opinion todays Hollywood has for movie audiences -- that  we should be delighted to pay to watch some attractive actors wielding every kind of firearm. Our advice Stay home and watch for real shooting stars instead.

Share Tweet In 2 Guns Denzel Washington is an undercover DEA agent and Mark Wahlberg is an undercover Naval intelligence officer each separately investigating the same south-of-the-border drug outfit. The two men dont know each others loyalties nor do they trust each other once their loyalties are discovered. In the balance hangs 43 million in cash which theyve knocked off from a bank--all part of their plan(s) more or less. In the line of fire are Washingtons colleague/paramour (Paula Patton) a Mexican kingpin (Edward James Olmos) Wahlbergs rank-pulling boss (James Marsden) and just about anyone caught in the pairs path. Based on a comic-book miniseries by Steven Grant this setup illustrates both 2 Guns potential and potential pratfalls. Theres no shortage of surprises and reversals--but not much beyond them either. The film illustrates a paradox of shell-game storytelling The more every motivation and interaction is suspect the harder it is for anything to matter.Watching a group of people repeatedly double-cross one another may sound like fun but it plays like an exercise--a dutiful round of escalating one-upmanship that powers through twists and turns before reaching a borderline-arbitrary conclusion. For some the no-frills action half-pint Jim Thompson scenario and buddy-cop wisecracks might be enough. Icelandic director Baltasar Kormakur has an affinity for this sort of unpretentious genre fare and compared to say Michael Bays Bad Boys outings his films take a refreshingly modest approach to excess. (Like last years Kormakur/Wahlberg smuggling movie Contraband 2 Guns is shot in a drab seedy palette that doesnt glamorize the proceedings.) Washington does his usual world-weary riff Wahlberg is amusingly earnest as a character who badly needs some professional cynicism but both are upstaged by Bill Paxton as a torturing psychopath who affects the attitude of a Southern gentleman. (If that doesnt sound sub-Tarantino enough theres also a running joke about how its unwise to rob a bank near a diner that serves good donuts.) As in Contraband Kormakur offers a hint of a political statement in this case about the inherent potential for corruption whenever competing government agencies are operating in international territory. But it doesnt quite make it. On almost every level 2 Guns is content to be as flavorless and forgettable as its title.

So I re-checked the trailers and yes apparently there are some things the studio wants you to know before you go into the theater. And you really should or nothing is going to make any sense. Because although Denzel Washington looks like a smooth criminal hes in fact DEA. Mark Wahlberg may act like a stupid crook but hes Navy Special Forces. The thing is as they go prepare to pull a job together neither of them knows that about the other. They find that out soon enough though. What they dont find out is why their mission went wrong or why three separate groups of men with guns now want to kill them. To tell you the truth I was a little confused myself for the first half-hour and Id seen the trailers. Because what the two characters were doing -- basically robbing a bank in order to get hold of the narco-dollars stashed there -- made no sense any way you thought about it. Until I realized I wasnt supposed to think about it at all and just sort of take it for the comic book it came from and wants to be. And if you can check your logic at the door ""2 Guns"" can be a pretty entertaining two hours in a sort of WHAM KERPOW way. The ultra-stylish Baltasar Kormakur -- the Icelandic director behind Wahlbergs ""Contraband"" -- stages things quickly but clearly and he finds some striking images in his bordertown settings. And the stars are terrific playing to their most amiable sides -- Washington doing the ultra-cool player in the porkpie hat Wahlberg in his baseball cap all puppyish and chewing gum. That could have been their nicknames. It could even have been the title ""Porkpie and Baseball."" That has a `70s kind of feel to it and so do Washingtons and Wahlbergs scenes together as they keep up a constant needling barrage of banter. Wahlberg pokes holes in Washingtons icy reserve. Washington ridicules Wahlbergs constant hey-buddy amiability. (""Nobody likes you"" he insists.) Hollywood hasnt given us a cuter couple all summer. The movie has a few other things going for it particularly Edward James Olmos as a brutal cartel boss. The action sequences are exciting without being excessive and even for a comic-book movie nothing is truly over the top (except perhaps its casually cynical conviction that absolutely every U.S. institution is murderous and corrupt). Theres even occasionally something like an adult moment like the no-commitment coupling between Washington and his boss and sometimes-girl the husky-voiced Paula Patton. ""Did you ever love me?"" she asks bluntly. He hesitates. ""I really meant to love you"" he says wistfully -- as if damn he just never found the time. Does the film hold together logically? In no way shape or form. Do the trailers spoil the movies surprises? They dont even help explain them. But for a movie with so many dead bodies theres still something strangely lively about ""2 Guns"" -- a film which is certainly too much and often too confusing but never ever too dull. Ratings note The film contains violence gore sexual situations nudity strong language and drug references. 2 Guns (R) Universal (109 min.) Directed by Baltasar Kormakur.

Its where lesser summer movies are cast off and buried in a landfill of indifference. But it can also be a month of unexpected gems. With the big studios orgy of superhero tentpoles and shock-and-awe action spectaculars now safely behind us we can finally turn the page take a deep breath and if were lucky be pleasantly surprised. I dont know if any movie starring two marquee heavyweights as consistently dependable as Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg can technically qualify as an under-the-radar stealth attack but their new buddy crime caper 2 Guns caught me completely off guard in all the right ways. Washington and Wahlberg two actors who can take themselves a bit too seriously at times cut loose and seem to be having a blast swapping below-the-belt insults as a pair of undercover agents posing as drug dealers. Their assignment Nab a south-of-the-border cocaine kingpin played by Edward James Olmos. The catch Each is working for a different government agency and thinks his partner is a real-deal trafficker. Washington plays Bobby Trench a deep-cover DEA agent decked out with blingy gold incisors a salt-and-pepper goatee and an interchangeable array of ring-a-ding-ding Rat Pack hats. Wahlberg is Marcus ""Stig"" Stigman a Navy Intelligence officer with a winking cool-cat cockiness and a knack for cracking wise at exactly the wrong time. After a series of double crosses the guys -- each still trying to stick to his cover story as a criminal -- plot to knock over a sleepy New Mexico bank. But the vault holds way more cash than it should. Without giving away too many of the films byzantine plot twists lets just say they soon figure out that neither one is who he says he is. So theyre forced to team up (for real this time) to find out who framed them and why. Back and forth they go across the U.S.-Mexico border squaring off with their bureaucratic superiors (Paula Patton and James Marsden) Olmos posse of seedy henchmen and best of all Bill Paxton as a beady-eyed bolo-tie-wearing sadist. Goosed along by a pulpy Elmore Leonard vibe 2 Guns is essentially a B movie classed up by its two A-list stars. Icelandic director Baltasar Kormakur who previously put Wahlberg through his underworld paces in last years Contraband seems to be out to turn 2 Guns into a sort of throwback to the sin-soaked Southwest noirs Sam Peckinpah made back in the early 70s like The Getaway and Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia -- only funnier and fleeter. Washington flashing his signature frisky grin is fast and loose in a way he hasnt been since Training Day. And Wahlberg gives as good as he gets (if not better) as a motormouthed smart-ass. Ever since Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy first traded four-letter digs in 1982s 48 Hrs. the black-and-white buddy formula has been trotted out so many times that its become a hack Hollywood screenwriting cliche. Thankfully Blake Masters rat-a-tat dialogue doesnt dwell on the leads racial differences. Washingtons Bobby and Wahlbergs Stig clash simply because ones a cynic who trusts no one and the other is as psyched as a puppy to have a playmate. Nothing more nothing less. Since so much of what happens in the second half of 2 Guns hinges on its bottomless grab bag of double and triple crosses it would be cruel to reveal too much about the films plot or the dirty motives of its arsenal of colorful heavies. All I will say is that after months of big-screen bloat and bombast 2 Guns is a much-needed reminder that the best summer surprises can come when you least expect them.

""If it breaks it isnt."" Theres a whole lot of breaking going on in ""2 Guns"" a movie that uneasily mixes typical mismatched-buddy-cop jokiness with excessive violence that derails the enterprise. Filmmakers like Quentin Tarantino and Shane Black more often than not know how to show just enough mayhem in just the right increments so that the laughs keep coming. See video 2 Guns Red Band Trailer There Are Far More Than 2 Guns Director Baltasar Kormakur (""Contraband"") working from Blake Masters adaptation of Steven Grants graphic novel lacks that precise touch. One minute were chuckling over the banter between the leads and then someone gets tortured or shot in the kneecap and the comic tone evaporates. That banter mostly works however since most of it goes back and forth between Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg. As the film begins we see Bobby (Washington) and Stig (Wahlberg) plotting to rob a small-town bank where drug kingpin Papi Greco (Edward James Olmos) makes a sizable weekly cash deposit. Not to get too deeply into spoiler territory neither Bobbys nor Stigs intentions wind up being what we originally thought. But while the two of them are scamming each other they are in turn each betrayed by the people they thought they could trust forcing them to band together as they become the target of the DEA the CIA and the U.S. Navy to say nothing of a very angry Papi. Washington and Wahlberg make this fairly flimsy material far more fun than it should be. Among its many crimes ""2 Guns"" is steeped in masculine panic from the constant references to male genitalia and what characters plan to do with other peoples junk to Paula Patton getting saddled with perhaps the most gratuitous nude scene by a major actress since Halle Berry in ""Swordfish."" (The camera actually starts on her breasts and moves its way up to her eyes as though Kormakur was ordering a basket of wings from a Hooters waitress.) The director does know his way around an elaborate set piece whether its a car-chase-turned-fist-fight or the blowing up of a cafeteria kitchen but its the more one-on-one moments of sadism that make the tone veer too sharply. He could have removed some wackiness and made a gritty action movie (although granted that strategy served him none too well in ""Contraband"") or toned down the viciousness and played this off for comedy but as it is ""2 Guns"" is neither fish nor fowl. Still an eclectic mix of actors (the cast also includes Bill Paxton James Marsden and Fred Ward) got a paycheck and the whole thing will probably play like a charm trimmed for content on TNT one of these days. Its no fiasco but its hardly worth 19 more guns saluting it either. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

TWITTER Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg are well matched in Baltasar Kormakurs ""anti-buddy"" film. Many more than two firearms await viewers in Baltasar Kormakurs 2 Guns an action-heavy crime film whose protagonists consistently get more than they bargained for. Think youre stealing three million bucks from that bank? Try 43 million. Think theres one lawman undercover in the drug cartel? Double that and then set the two against each other in some double-blind scheming that forces a reevaluation of the label ""buddy movie."" Nothing here is underplayed least of all a convoluted plot that eventually has three governmental entities and one cartel fighting over the loot. But the picture survives its excesses thanks to winning chemistry between stars Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg who animate banter-heavy dialogue and click so well one wonders why they havent shared the screen before. Much less generic than marketing materials suggest the film could outearn recent action offerings from either star. PHOTOS 20 Best and Worst Music to Movie Crossovers When we meet them Bobby Trench (Washington) and ""Stig"" Stigman (Wahlberg) appear to be a team of smugglers freelancing for Mexican kingpin Papi Greco (Edward James Olmos) while planning to steal some of his money from a small-town stateside bank. In fact Trench is DEA and Stig works for U.S. naval intelligence; the former intends to use the cash as evidence in Grecos prosecution while Stigs superiors want it to fund off-the-books military ops. Unaware of their conflicting undercover roles each thinks the other is just a crook wholl be disposed of after the heist. But seeing how well they pretend to be buddies in early scenes -- giving each other hell at diners each mans brand of swagger complementing the others -- no viewer will expect things to play out that way in the end. The men are still in the dark about each others identities when after the heist Stig shoots Trench and takes the money to his commander (James Marsden) -- who in turn double-crosses Stig and sets a crew of corrupt Navy toughs out to kill him. This is still early in a story whose many twists include the news that the 43 million was not Papis money but the CIAs Bill Paxton lays it on thick as a menacing Southern spook whos been taking a share of cartel business for years and will not rest until he gets every penny back. The plots outrageous complexity -- we havent even gotten to Trenchs colleague (Paula Patton) whos sleeping with him while keeping appointments with a mysterious second boyfriend -- may have been more credibly laid out in the source material Steven Grants five-issue comic series but here it demands more than the usual suspension of disbelief. The filmmakers feel obligated to deliver a certain quotient of summer-movie action when a more slow-burn focus on deceit and second-guessing might have worked much better. PHOTOS Denzel Washington His Life and Career in Pictures Wisely stepping back from the furrowed-brow seriousness of his first two American productions Kormakur appears to be having a good time here. Hes still far from the wry sexiness of his 2000 Icelandic debut 101 Reykjavik a film leaning more toward Pedro Almodovar than to Michael Bay but this effort has a personality beyond the charisma of its leads. Wahlberg shows more charm and vulnerability than he typically reveals in his action roles playing Stig as a compulsive flirt with women but a romantic when it comes to bonds between men. Washington dapper in a collection of sharp-brimmed hats again finds ways to support a younger white co-star while remaining the most magnetic ingredient onscreen.

Unless that movie is 2 Guns in which case you probably need a good deal more.The problem with so many current action movies this one included is that once youve seen one you cant help feeling youve seen them all. 2 Guns is directed by Baltasar Kormakur who gave us last summers acceptably entertaining Contraband an action-thriller with a breezy agreeable tone. 2 Guns is pretty much more of the same Even though the plots of the two movies are completely different--this one is adapted from the BOOM Studios graphic novels by Steven Grant--2 Guns with its hypercomplicated plot and semi-gritty just-rolled-out-of-bed visuals comes off as similar to 1001 things weve already seen. The movies pleasures whatever they may be stem from a kind of summer-diversion deja vu. The tagline could be ""If you like things like 2 Guns youll love 2 Guns"" Because it all feels that familiar.There are a few differentiating potentially intriguing details of course. One character is an undercover DEA agent the action-movie equivalent of a comfy shoe Denzel Washingtons Bobby Trench works both side of the law though in the end hes with the good guys. When hes consorting with baddies he just slips in a set of gold fronts and gets to work. Bobbys partner--or rather the guy Bobby works with who doesnt realize hes Bobbys partner--is Mark Wahlbergs Marcus ""Stig"" Stigman a naval intelligence officer gone AWOL. Now thats something we dont see every day and Stigs gradually unfolding backstory is one of the mechanisms that keeps 2 Guns moving forward.Film Details 2 Guns RatingR GenreAction/Adventure Running Time109 More Info Trailer In the end we may not learn all we want to know about Stig but theres a decent amount of rough-and-tumble gunplay and ludicrous banter in between. Bobby and Stig kick off the proceedings by robbing a small-town bank. Later we learn more about why. (A Mexican drug kingpin played by Edward James Olmos has something to do with it.) Along the way they run afoul of a lawman with a weirdly elastic sense of justice--that would be Earl played by a smooth-talking bolo-tie-wearing Bill Paxton. Watching him slither so effortlessly between the cracks of right and wrong is one of the movies pleasures.Paula Patton an extremely appealing presence shows up now and then because Denzel needs a love interest. She too plays a DEA agent and though her role is pivotal her character is lazily ill-defined. But Kormakur isnt particularly interested in character development. His strong suit is moving the action along fast and he fulfills that duty ably. Perhaps too ably The convoluted plot demands a lot of rapid-fire expositional dialogue which is fun at the beginning and eventually grows tiresome. Plus after a point nonstop action becomes its own kind of tedium.Still theres some mild fun to be had in watching Washington and Wahlberg bicker and spar. Wahlbergs Stig may be muscularly endowed but his vocabulary skills leave something to be desired. Hes charming in a goofy way when he calls Bobby a ""misanthorpe."" And because the two dont really like each other--at least not until they learn to love each other--they spend lots of time wrasslin like disgruntled twin brothers. That boyish aggression restores a few drops of youthfulness to both of them.Washington smooth as a satin sheet is always devilishly pleasing to watch in his more comic roles and he doesnt disappoint here. His scenes with Paxton have an extra-special crackle Paxtons Earl wants to recover the millions that have been stolen from him; Washingtons Bobby has some very specific reasons to want to hang on to the money. The two characters talk circles around each other like fighting birds eyeing each other warily in the ring. But theyre not enough to make 2 Guns memorable. This is a here today gone tomorrow trifle albeit one with lots of gunplay. In midsummer that may be enough but its still a shame that 2 Guns shoots so many blanks.Subscribe to the Voice Film Club podcastFollow VoiceFilmClub Ellen Page Kidnaps an Infant in Tallulah but She Means Well NEXT Contact Stephanie Zacharek Follow szacharek Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

But Robert Trench (Denzel Washington) and Marcus Stigman (Mark Wahlberg) have each been hiding something from the other--namely that they work undercover for the United States government. Trench is DEA Stigman Navy intelligence and theyre both trying to infiltrate the same drug cartel run by the bullish Papi Greco (Edward James Olmos). After they hit a small-town savings and loan where Greco supposedly funnels his cash they get quite a surprise and soon have everyone from gangland heavies to the CIA on their tails. Adding another American mediocrity to his binational oeuvre after the Wahlberg-headlined thriller Contraband (2012) Icelandic director Baltasar Kormakur at least keeps the early sections of this slam-bang-boom action flick fleet and intriguing. The sunburned Southern U.S. locales are nicely utilized and Washington and Wahlberg have clearly been encouraged to riff and rap with each other to their hearts delight. (Never underestimate the pleasure of watching two bona fide movie stars having a lark.) It also helps that the graphic-novel-inspired film is scripted by Blake Masters creator of the late Showtime series Brotherhood who knows a thing or two about memorable characterization. Even supporting players like Olmos and Bill Paxton (the latter plays a merciless Russian-roulette-loving government operative) get meaty roles to sink their teeth into. A shame then that 2 Guns quickly degenerates into boilerplate Hollywood sound and fury complete with a climactic Mexican standoff that revolves around a massive burning pile of money.

Here as there Kormakur shows he knows his way around an action movie better than most keeping the pace quick the banter lively and the old-school mostly CGI-free thrills delivering right on schedule.

Subscribe today.See more. Based on the 2008 BOOM Studios comics series by writer Steven Grant and illustrator Mateus Santolouco the hyper-convoluted plot of ""2 Guns"" bears more than a passing resemblance to Oliver Stones recent ""Savages"" with its dense web of American military types and government agents battling each other -- and the Mexican drug cartels -- over a multimillion dollar jackpot. It also pays affectionate homage to Don Siegels marvelous 1973 ""Charley Varrick"" beginning with a bank robbery in the fictional town of Tres Cruces N.M. (also the setting of Siegels pic) where partners in crime Bobby Trench (Washington) and Stig Stigman (Wahlberg) attempt to steal 3 million in cash belonging to Mexican drug lord Papi Greco (a terrific Edward James Olmos). But theres more to this bank -- and to these robbers -- than meets the eye. Unbeknownst to each other Trench is an undercover DEA agent and Stigman an undercover Navy intelligence officer each on a mission to bring down Grecos cartel. The bank heist is supposed to be the coup de grace that will land the cartel boss behind bars. Except like Varrick before them Trench and Stigman find more cash in the banks coffers -- about 40 million more -- than they anticipated and before long theyre on the run from a whole slew of bad guys who have their designs on the loot. Among them Stigmans Navy superior (steely James Marsden) Grecos henchmen and an initially unidentified group of government heavies (led by a deliciously oily Bill Paxton) who employ Russian roulette as their preferred interrogation technique. Its spy-versus-spy for a while with Stig even shooting Bobby in the shoulder and leaving him for dead in the desert until the two figure out theyre each others best hope for making it out of this mess alive. So they pool their resources and set about playing all other sides against an uncertain middle. This leads to a series of slam-bang setpieces in which the two wronged agents try to recover the now-missing loot variously gaining and losing the upper hand as they travel back and forth across the U.S.-Mexico border. As in ""Savages"" theres a wry underlying sense in ""2 Guns"" of the international drug trade as a giant Monsanto-like corporation in which everybody -- from the DEA to the CIA -- is in for a piece of the action. Kormakur who cut his teeth on commercial Icelandic films that were released internationally as arthouse attractions (most notably the adaptation of bestselling crime novel ""Jar City"") has taken to the American action-movie form like a fish to water. He seems entirely at ease shooting a pickup truck and a Ford Bronco doggedly chasing each other through desert brush or Washington and Wahlberg playing a very dangerous cat-and-mouse game with the entirety of a Texas Navy base. At their best both ""Contraband"" and ""2 Guns"" recall the work of Walter Hill in their emphasis on teamwork and their energetic unfussy action staged with a maximum of spatial clarity. (The superb widescreen cinematography with rich noir-like blacks and blazing desert browns and yellows is by Oliver Wood.) Though he doubtless has his sights set on bigger and more outwardly respectable studio projects one of these a year from Kormakur would hardly be an unwelcome thing. Where ""Contraband"" had a built-in rooting interest because of the peril in which the Wahlberg characters family members ultimately found themselves ""2 Guns"" has lower emotional stakes despite Kormakur and screenwriter Blake Masters efforts to insert some latent romantic tension between Bobby and his estranged ex (a fellow DEA agent played by Paula Patton). But a movie like this rises or falls by the chemistry of its leads and Washington and Wahlberg two of the most likable leading men in movies today to begin with are especially likable here. The roles are hardly the most challenging of their respective careers but they invest them with a lot of personality and charm from the way Wahlberg delivers an ill-timed quip to Washingtons constant fussing with Bobbys array of designer hats. Thanks to Masters (a Roger Corman alum who created Showtimes ""Brotherhood series) everyone has smarter-than-usual dialogue to spar with. (Washingtons melancholy lament to Patton ""I really meant to love you"" is a line Bogart might have said to Gloria Grahame in ""In a Lonely Place."") Airtight editing by veteran Tony Scott collaborator Michael Tronick enhances an ace tech package. Film Review 2 GunsReviewed at AMC Empire New York July 24 2013.
