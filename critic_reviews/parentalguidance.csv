Comments (1) click to enlarge Parental Guidance Rated PG  104 minutes  2012 This grating family comedy resembles a sitcom in its flat lighting patronizing music cues and frames supplying little visual information apart from the actors mugging faces. Billy Crystal and Bette Midler play recent retirees trying to bond with their wacky grandkids and by the time this is over weve learned a good deal about all the characters bathroom habits. Reactionary in its attitude toward parenting the movie presents the kids parents (Tom Everett Scott and Marisa Tomei) as caricatured overprotective liberals and the culturally insensitive grandparents as paragons of common sense.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Tuesday Dec. 25 2012 400PM EST Last updated Tuesday Dec. 25 2012 521PM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Andy Fickman Written by Lisa Addario and Joe Syracuse Starring Billy Crystal Bette Midler and Marisa Tomei Classification G Country USA Language English Shortly after he gets fired from his job as a minor-league baseball announcer Artie Decker (Billy Crystal) and his wife Diane (Bette Midler) get a chance to spend time with their three grandchildren. Their worry-wart daughter Alice (Marisa Tomei) and her inventor husband Phil (Tom Everett Scott) have been invited to a convention/getaway so Alice reluctantly asks her parents to babysit for five days. Watch Parental Guidance official trailer Parental Guidance is one of those intergenerational embarrassment comedies in the Meet the Fockers line where children can enjoy seeing grown-ups looking ridiculous. Seniors meanwhile can chuckle along with Arties bewilderment over such phenomena as tofu Twitter and kids baseball games designed to end in a tie. Alice stands as the mid-generation audiences representative here - she gets hives just thinking about her boisterously vulgar parents. In an early scene she offers some helpful advice to her trio of coddled kids - the perfectionist 12-year-old Harper (Bailee Madison) timid stuttering eight-year-old Turner (Joshua Rush) and Barker (Kyle Harrison Breitkopf) a five-year-old hellion with a trouble-making imaginary friend.Unable to bear the thought of exposing the kids to her parents Alice makes an excuse to come back home early from her planned sexy time with hubbie so she hangs around for a few more scenes. Predictably Arties and Dianes old-school carefree/careless parenting style is at odds with her neurotically precious house rules which include ""three put-ups"" for every ""put-down"" and a ban on the words ""dont"" and ""no."" When the family goes to a restaurant its ""Pan-Asian"" not Chinese and the restaurants owner (Gedde Watanabe) is a silly gent who says ""Oy vey"" and believes that Barkers imaginary kangaroo friend is real.As well as a meditation on changing generational customs Parental Guidance is a reminder of all those things that we have in common especially below the belt. Artie gets hit in the crotch by both a water gun and a baseball bat (he counter-strikes by projectile-vomiting his chili dog). Later Barker urinates from the top of a half-pipe at a skateboarding event causing cameo star Tony Hawk to wipe out in a pee puddle. Theres also a touching scene as grandpa sings a song to help his constipated grandson squeeze one out in the mens room at a baseball game.Director Andy Fickman who previously made the cross-dressing basketball comedy Shes The Man and the Dwayne (The Rock) Johnson comedy The Game Plan follows Crystals lead as the comedian riffs through scenes with a glazed mock-incredulity tossing out one-liners as if listening to some private Catskills rhythm track. Though Midler breezily trades quips with him at the same tempo her character feels sketchy here as a former good-time weather gal whose main project is to transform her earnest 12-year-old granddaughter into a pubescent hussy.Tomei in the doubly thankless role of ungrateful daughter and over-controlling mom at least wins a sympathy vote and serves as a cautionary example. Parents of young children be guided Go book a hotel and have some naughty fun. This movie isnt for you although its possible it will serve as a meeting point for your elders and youngers.

The Billy Crystal/Bette Midler vehicle is an extended ""in my day"" joke intended to convey the superiority of old people over a lot of supposedly contemporary behavior that doesnt actually exist in real life. The film is unpopulated by anything resembling an actual human being and the non-Lipitor-ingesting characters are 2-D cutouts for Billy Crystal to smack around with his smirky jowls. Artie Decker (Crystal) a cornball announcer for the Fresno Grizzlies is fired from his job by an executive who sprays a withering fusillade of Internet buzzwords advancing the films contention that non-elderly people are ridiculous aliens while providing one of many opportunities for Billy Crystals jowls to portray ""befuddled."" Out of touch with tweets or whatever Artie along with his wife Diane (Midler) launches his new season of unemployment by babysitting his daughters fucked-up children in a digitally automated house ""invented"" by his son-in-law. Among all the carpooling and violin lessons and whatnot Midler Crystal and Crystals befuddled jowls evince smugness toward caricatures of overprotective parents educators spewing befuddling jargon befuddling technology and a befuddling kids baseball league with a befuddling lack of strikes penalties or points. The film might be remembered for its discovery of the hateful state of ""smug-fuddlement"" a combination of ""befuddlement"" and ""smug.""

At the same time hes a clueless crank when it comes to everything thats changed in America over the past 25 years. After being fired from his job as a broadcaster for the Fresno Grizzlies Artie along with his wife Diane (Bette Midler) is asked by their daughter (Marisa Tomei) to spend five days babysitting her three children so that she and her husband (Tom Everett Scott) can go off on a holiday. (""Were the other grandparents"" says Diane in horror after seeing that her daughters mantlepiece is full of smiling photographs of... the kids paternal grandparents. The ones who are always there.) Artie shows up bearing sweets as a gift only to learn that his grandchildren arent allowed to eat sugar (Artie ""No Carvel? Thats the saddest thing I ever heard""). Its his introduction to the fact that theyve grown up in a world he didnt even know existed a squishy and empathic behaviorally correct vigilantly monitored everybody-wins universe of ""enlightened"" middle-class child-rearing where kids are coddled as if one small blunder of insensitivity could destroy their futures. Its not enough that the daughter Harper (Bailee Madison) whos studying the violin is a solemn perfectionist; she has to be diagnosed with ""high achievement syndrome."" And Turner (Joshua Rush) who stutters attends a speech-therapy class thats so progressive the kids arent even asked...to speak Of course Artie the old-school grandpa is having none of this. Hes the bull in the china shop of the new family sensitivity. He feeds the kids ice-cream cake watches Saw with Turner and deals with bouts of acting out from the mop-topped young Barker (Kyle Harrison Breitkopf) by bribing him with cash. Except that Artie also cant stop apologizing for his gauchely out-of-date point of view. At that speech class he chides the teacher (which is funny) then begs for her forgiveness (which is not). He mixes up Barkers food on his plate (a no-no Barker likes his portions ""not to touch"") and then basically says Sorry sorry I didnt know At a kids baseball game when he learns that there are no outs and not even a score (lest the children end up scarred by too much competition) he gets up in the stands to protest but that token bout of misbehavior goes nowhere either. Parental Guidance has been slapped together by its director Andy Fickman and after a while it seems to run out of jokes maybe to make room for all the crying and hug-it-out family redemption in the last half hour. In form the movie satirizes our overly controlled era in which an unhip grandfather like Artie with his bad old jokes and what-the-hell approach to discipline is far more of a free spirit than the kids who look at him like hes a dinosaur. The trouble is the movie is structured to be on Arties side but it actually has too much allegiance to the new mode of parenting to allow Artie to disembowel it completely. Which makes Billy Crystal in this role a rebel with foam rubber teeth.

On screen its painful.

Youd have Parental Guidance. And youd be sad. Artie (Billy Crystal) and Diane Decker (Bette Midler) fly from Fresno to Atlanta to babysit their three grandchildren for a few days; their only child Alice (Marisa Tomei) and her husband Phil Simmons (Tom Everett Scott) desperately need a getaway. Phils parents the good grandparents arent available otherwise Alice never would have asked Artie and Diane because her parents have been vocal about their disdain for her parenting style. Shes a modern mother who deprives her three offspring of sugar and imposes the rule of affirmations. Instead of ""no"" she says ""consider the consequences."" For every putdown the three young Simmons impose upon each other they are told to then give three ""put-ups."" This doesnt seem like the worst way to live but Artie thinks it is silly. He himself is the kind of parent who has no idea that his daughter has been web designing for ESPN for the last five years even though he himself has long been employed in the sports world (announcing games for the Fresno Grizzlies and dreaming of becoming the voice of the San Francisco Giants). (READ About the Billy Crystal you can trust everyones favorite Oscar host) In keeping with the holiday spirit here is an attempt to use Alices rules for putdowns vs. put-ups. Only Billy Crystal and his doctors know exactly what he has done to his face but the fact that he now looks like a skinned grape is so distracting that most of his lines even the 25 percent that are funny tend to get lost. Tomei valiantly tries to compensate for the lack of mobility in his and Midlers faces by moving all her features at once the brow furrows the mouth twists the nose wrinkles. Sometimes Alice seems drunk but Tomeis willingness to appear with frizzy and/or windblown hair throughout the film is brave. Third put-up Alice wears a very cute pair of shoes. Forget about the affirmations; pick-ups are too elusive largely because Andy Fickman (You Again) is such an astonishingly clumsy director. During a scene where the youngest Simmons Barker (Kyle Harrison Breitkopf) confronts his supposed demons by throwing his imaginary friend Karl the kangaroo into oncoming traffic Fickman hits every wrong note possible both in terms of narrative and visuals. The driver of the car that hits Karl is a chattering Asian stereotype weve already endured once and arent happy to see again. A cop pulls up and the screen inexplicably fills with a close-up of his headlight. Alice arrives to deliver a shrill invective to her father who might be upset although its hard to tell with the immovable face. (SEE When Bette Midler made the cover of TIME) At least the kids are cute. As Barker Breitkopf handles his role as chief brat with relish. Joshua Rush who plays his older brother--the one with the stutter that presumably Alices over-zealous approach to parenting is responsible for--is sweet. And as the eldest Simmons child Harper the very game Bailee Madison (Just Go With It) works harder than anyone else in the cast. There is an idiotic scene where Artie and Diane instigate a game of kick-the-can in the backyard to get these over-scheduled sugar-deprived children to enjoy life. The appeal to nostalgia seems off since Artie and Diane are supposed to be in their early 60s rather than children of the depression and moreover their version of the game includes no ""it"" no ""jail"" just kicking a can as if it were a soccer ball. But Madison makes it look as though Harper is having the time of her life showing impressive dedication even as the famous grownups around her with the exception of Tomei seem committed only to getting their paychecks. (READ TIMES 10 Questions with Midler) Movies like Parental Guidance (and money makers like Four Christmases Christmas with the Kranks Surviving Christmas Fred Claus just to name a few) suggest a consensus in Hollywood that what audiences desire at Christmas time are sloppily constructed movies about dysfunctional families featuring big name actors. Theyre supposed to make us feel better about our own families presumably. And I cant deny I did feel fonder of my own family afterward mostly because I know none of them would ever make me sit through Parental Guidance.

Starring Billy Crystal Bette Midler Marisa Tomei Director Andy Fickman Running time 145 Release Opened Dec 25 2012  Editorial Review Parental Guidance spans a gap across 3 generationsBy Michael OSullivanTuesday December 25 2012Its hard to know who exactly ""Parental Guidance"" was made for. With a script that relies heavily on gags about vomiting urinating and defecating -- and that includes not just a crack about ""melons"" as a euphemism for breasts but also a shot of Billy Crystal getting hit in the crotch by a baseball bat -- this generation-gap comedy about grandparents taking care of bratty grandkids seems like its not just made for children but written by one. On the other hand stale jokes about sciatica and the cluelessness of the elderly when it comes to tweeting and other forms of modern technology seem like they popped out of the VCR in the old folks home. The answer is that the movie is perfect for families. Assuming of course that a) your family has traveled in time from 1995 when most of the jokes in the movie were first written; b) you have absolutely nothing better to do on Christmas and c) you have no taste whatsoever. ""Parental Guidance"" is not just dull. Its aggressively dull as if the people who made it actually want to put you to sleep and then steal your wallet. (Check your pants before you leave the theater.) Its also badly overacted syrupy phony looking implausibly scripted formulaic and about 15 minutes too long. When yuppie parents (Marisa Tomei and Tom Everett Scott) go out of town for few days they decide to leave their brood of three spoiled crumb-snatchers (Bailee Madison Joshua Rush and Kyle Harrison Breitkopf) with the grandparents (Billy Crystal and Bette Midler). What ensues is exactly what you would expect disaster involving cake frosting on the face and apoplectic mugging followed by scenes of saccharine reconciliation so insincere they make Crystals dye job and Midlers facelift look natural. The normally wonderful Tomei acts with broad cartoonishness as though she has wandered off the set of a Nickelodeon sitcom. The three juvenile actors behave more like animatronic figures than real human beings. And Midler and Crystal (who also produced the film) are mired in a tar pit of schtick like Borscht Belt dinosaurs.

Director Andy Fickman (145). PG Crude humor. Area theaters. How is it possible that no one thought to pair Bette Midler and Billy Crystal before now? Its a shame they didnt choose a stronger project than Andy Fickmans family comedy but you could certainly ask for worse babysitters. ""Parental Guidance"" is the sort of movie that can be pressed into service when schools out cabin fever hits and everyone needs something to do. In that regard Midler and Crystal are happy to entertain cheerfully playing to adult audiences while taking hits (sometimes literally) for the kids. Their characters are not quite so comfortable around ankle-biters. Diane (Midler) is thrilled when their daughter Alice (Marisa Tomei) asks them to watch their three grandchildren for a week. Artie (Crystal) is less enthusiastic. Hes old-school the kind of grandpa who tells it like it is and isnt above the threat of a spanking when things get out of hand. Alice and her husband Phil (Tom Everett Scott) are gentler more liberal parents they shun sugar and believe in nurturing and ""using your words."" When Alice and Phil go on vacation Artie and Diane take over. Diane puts makeup on preteen Harper (Bailee Madison); Artie stuffs Turner (Joshua Rush) and Barker (Kyle Harrison Breitkopf) with ice cream. She bawls out Harpers demanding teacher; he bails on a playdate to go to a sportscasting audition. That Arties audition is for the X Games and he dresses like Vanilla Ice and Barker urinates on the half-pipe and causes Tony Hawk to slip and nearly break his neck tells you pretty much everything you need to know about this movie and whether your own family will appreciate it. Crystal and Midler are such confident pros that their crack timing elevates even substandard material. Midler seems to be having fun as the outrageous grandma while Crystal carries the heavier load with utter ease. Unfortunately writers Lisa Addario and Joe Syracuse arent up to the level of the stars. Do we really need hits to the groin and projectile vomiting? And why does Fickman direct with such broad sitcom pacing? These filmmakers are lucky enough to have two of the best in the business at their disposal. Perhaps they should have asked their leads for a little extra guidance. Magic moment Artie pays tribute to an imaginary kangaroo. Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"Parental Guidance 3 stars Article Comments () Things to do >> Movies >> Article Parental Guidance 3 stars SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments RELATED INFO Director Andy Fickman.Cast Billy Crystal Bette Midler Marissa Tomei.Rating PG for some rude humor. RELATED NEWS Goodykoontz interviews Crystal Midler By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Mon Dec 24 2012 1204 PM Theres something to be said for a movie not being as bad as it sounds.In fact thats most of what there is to say about ""Parental Guidance"" a comedy in which Billy Crystal and Bette Midler play old-school grandparents who have to keep their new-age-ish grandkids for a few days.Just read that description. Sounds brutal. But thanks to Crystal and Midler playing comfortable versions of the personas weve come to know its actually better than you would guess.Not great mind you. Not even good really for the most part. But it is sweet and means well and Crystal is much more engaging here than he is wearing a tux and mugging as the host of the Academy Awards. So thats something.Artie (Crystal) is a minor-league baseball announcer who after the last game of the season gets laid off. He is talking about it with his wife Diane (Midler) when the phone rings. Its their daughter Alice (Marisa Tomei). She and her husband Phil (Tom Everett Scott) have to go out of town for a few days; could Artie and Diane look after the kids? A set-up scene lets us know that this is the last thing Alice and Phil want to do.Alice didnt approve of the way Artie and Diane raised her. Shes particularly distant from Artie who wasnt around a lot while traveling with the team. She and Phil are much more touchy-feely types taking things like kid empowerment to absurd levels.And there pretty much is your movie. Will the grandchildren reluctant at first eventually respond to Artie and Diane? Will Artie and Diane learn lessons too? Will Alice and Artie become closer? Will Artie get hit in the groin with a baseball bat?You know the answer.You know all the answers really if youve ever seen any movie remotely like this. The thing that makes it modestly better than it might have been is Crystal. (Midler is underused but her usual brassy self when shes around.) There was a time you may recall when he was a really funny guy.That changed somewhere along the line. He became a kind of parody of himself. Maybe he believed all the lavish praise heaped upon him as Oscar host (none of which came from this corner). Maybe he got rich and happy and didnt feel like he had to try as hard anymore. It happens.This is the first time in ages some of the old stand-up Crystal shows through flashes of quick wit instead of Borscht-belt antics. Not to the extent that it used to in such movies as ""When Harry Met Sally ..."" (which was ahem 23 years ago). But better than youd expect.Just like the movie.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

"Movie review Parental Guidance a misguided mess - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Movies_nowMovie review Parental Guidance a misguided messThe heavy-handed bid to assemble the elements of a family comedy fall flat amid crass antics and far too little warmth.December 24 2012|By Mark Olsen Los Angeles Times Billy Crystal and Bette Midler star in ""Parental Guidance."" (Phil Caruso 20th Century...)Things arent what they used to be in the world of ""Parental Guidance"" not just with the kids but parents too.In this lazy smugly self-satisfied movie starring and produced by Billy Crystal the comedian apparently wanted to say a thing or two about modern ""helicopter"" parenting techniques from the perspective of an old-school been-there grandparent.Crystal and Bette Midler portray the less-popular ""other grandparents"" to the three children of their only daughter played by Marisa Tomei. (Tom Everett Scott is Tomeis husband; it is difficult to recall if his character has a name.)Best of 2012A MoviesA |A TVA |A Pop musicA |A JazzA |A Video Games|A ArtA |A TheaterA |A DanceA |A Classical musicTomei and Scott reluctantly call upon Midler and Crystal to watch their kids so the younger couple can take a trip away together. The childrens highly regimented lifestyles immediately begin to fall apart upon the arrival of their new temp caretakers.""Parental Guidance"" is intended as an inoffensive diversion for multiple generations who have run out of post-holiday dinner chitchat a fact underscored by its something-for-everyone cameo appearances.Theres skateboarder Tony Hawk actor Gedde Watanabe (who played Long Duk Dong in ""Sixteen Candles"") and even former Brooklyn Dodgers pitcher Ralph Branca (who gave up the legendary ""The Giants Win the Pennant"" home run).Perhaps the whole family is also meant to enjoy the sight of Crystal being struck in the crotchal region with a baseball bat causing him to vomit chili-dog onto a young boy?VIDEO The Envelope Screening SeriesMidler seems wildly underutilized throughout. Only she Tomei and Bailee Madison as Tomeis daughter inject a few precious moments of warmth.The whole story seems geared to somehow proving that Crystals character was right all along that they could all do better with a magic combination of old-fashioned discipline and a little loosening up.In Judd Apatows new comedy ""This Is 40"" a mother and father tell their two children theyd like them to spend less time with their electronic devices and more time doing things like building forts or playing kick the can. The teenage daughter squeals with exasperation ""Nobody does that crap its 2012""As if to prove the point of how deeply willfully out of touch the worldview of ""Parental Guidance"" really is Crystal and Midler share a moment of rain-kissed reverie teaching their three grandchildren to play you guessed it kick the can.

Billy Crystal and Bette Midler stuck with a weak premise reprise their earlier cinematic successes. Photo Phil Caruso Twentieth Century Fox Parental Guidance review Not so grand 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Parental Guidance Comedy. Starring Billy Crystal Bette Midler Marisa Tomei and Tom Everett Scott. Directed by Andy Fickman. (PG. 105 minutes.) ""Parental Guidance"" offers a very cranky worldview suggesting that the current generation of parents isnt fit to raise a fern. A 5-year-old who never hears the word ""no"" becomes a one-person wrecking crew ruining a kitchen a symphony performance and the X Games in one 48-hour period. Bette Midler and Billy Crystal come to the rescue trying to salvage both their movie grandchildren and this harmlessly mediocre cross-generational comedy. They have varying degrees of success with both jobs. The script offers no surprises - its the kind of movie where the writers get out of a comedic jam by hitting Crystal in the testicles with a baseball bat and putting Midler on a stripper pole. The setup is old school versus new school with Artie and Diane Decker (Crystal and Midler) forced by a last-minute crisis to parachute in and raise their over-programmed grandchildren for a few days. A stressed-out music prodigy older daughter stuttering middle son and red-haired hellion kindergartener offer a variety of obvious conflicts. The vibe reflects the latter third of John Hughes career - where members of the chilly upper middle class learn life lessons from grittier forces. (Replace Crystal and Midler with Jonah Hill and this would be an ""Uncle Buck"" remake.) From the moment the Deckers arrive everything is presented in stereotype-perpetuating extremes. Grandpa wants to play kick the can. The kids think he should recycle it. The grandparents are aghast that a childrens baseball game has unlimited strikes and no score. One of the funnier running jokes The kids dad started a company that has turned the entire house into a clone of Apples Siri software. Perhaps anticipating an older audience most of the lessons are one-sided with the old-timers seemingly harming the children while actually saving them. How much does this movie skew toward Boomers? The late Giants announcer Russ Hodges figures prominently in the plot. If youre going to sneak a pastrami sandwich into one movie this Christmas make it ""Parental Guidance."" All of the above puts Crystal and Midler in a comfortable place rattling off greatest hits of their earlier cinematic successes. She gets to sing a couple of times. He talks about baseball complains a little too much and makes fun of Twitter. The childrens parents are secondary characters with Marisa Tomei wasted in the trying-to-have-it-all maternal role. Its hard to watch this wonderful actress and scientific marvel - shes looked 33 years old since 1986 - strapped with recycled ""Modern Family"" subplots minus the sharp writing. Director Andy Fickman opts against subtlety at every turn. A score filled with heavy strings and the occasional ringing of chimes telegraphs all emotional cues practically willing the water out of your tear ducts. The grandparents are feisty but the language and themes never challenge the PG rating. (Midler remains very tastefully dressed on that stripper pole.) The result is the rare film that can be watched by three or four generations at once with no one feeling particularly alienated. Two more compliments for the filmmakers who have taken a little bit of an unfair beating in this review 1. Huge credit for making the Fresno Grizzlies figure prominently into the plot. Take that East Coast bias 2. My generation may take issue with your parenting criticisms but we thank you for bringing Gedde ""Long Duk Dong"" Watanabe back in a short but entertaining role. Hes a close second to Tom Wopat in ""Django Unchained"" as the most welcome cameo in a 2012 Christmas release. Peter Hartlaub is The San Francisco Chronicles pop culture critic.

Still its several notches above ""makes you feel the passing of each precious second"" or ""better to stare at the fire exit sign than at the screen"" and that counts for something right? Say what you will about the underrated ""The Guilt Trip"" another current pairing of a nebbishy comic and a diva of a certain age that movie at least offers two recognizable human beings of different generations meeting in the middle and learning something from each other. This time the nebbish is Billy Crystal the diva is Bette Midler and as far as the movies concerned every single thing these two know about child-rearing is right and everything the younger generation does is at best misguided. The youngster in this case is Alice (Marisa Tomei) whos reluctant to ask her parents Artie (Crystal) and Diane (Midler) to come babysit when she and her husband Phil (Tom Everett Scott) need to go to Hilton Head for a business trip. But with Phils folks off on a cruise and Phil and Alice desperate for some time away from their progeny Artie and Diane fly from Fresno to Atlanta to help out. (The movies Atlanta resembles the one I grew up in only mine had black people.) Things get off on an awkward foot when Diane sees all the photos of the kids -- perfectionist violinist Harper (Bailee Madison of ""Dont Be Afraid of the Dark"") stutterer Turner (Joshua Rush) and ginger terror Barker (Kyle Harrison Breitkopf) -- with Phils mom and dad making her realize that she and Artie are ""the other grandparents."" While Diane launches a campaign to make her grandkids love her Artie immediately violates all of Alices hyperprotective rules for the kids from what they can eat (tofu almond milk no sugar) to how they communicate (Alice and Phil say ""Consider the consequences"" instead of ""No"" and so on). The strained screenplay by Lisa Addario and Joe Syracuse (""Surfs Up"") then delivers a barrage of Artie and Dianes old-school parenting butting up against the straw man of Alices ridiculously New Age methods with lots of crazy-kid slapstick as well. This yields the occasional funny moment -- a sugar-crazed Harper shovels a handful of Carvel cake in her mouth and bellows at Alice ""You lied to me Yogurt is not the same as ice cream"" -- but the basic premise is that as messy as the grandparents methods might seem their ways ultimately win out in the end. Take for example Arties encounter with Turners speech therapist whose methods arent focused around having the kids actually talk. When he challenges her she points out that her Ph.D. in speech therapy from Yale trumps his decades of experience as a baseball announcer which would be a great put-down except that by the end of the movie its Artie and his MP3s of classic baseball moments and not the touchy-feely therapy that cures the kids stutter. Stupid Ph.D.s What do they know? Theres also a go-nowhere subplot about Artie trying to get a gig covering the X Games for ESPN. Bad enough that the storyline calls to mind the recent awful ""Playing for Keeps"" but the scene just winds up being another way for the movie to mock These Kids Today. (By this point weve already seen Artie get fired from his radio gig for not Tweeting enough plus a series of jokes about Phil and Alices fully-automated house that never seem to reach a punchline.) It would be easier to write off ""Parental Guidance"" in toto if there werent glimmers of a better movie underneath. Crystal comes off less smarmy than usual Midler tones her life-of-the-party shtick way way down and theres even a scene at the end that suggests the possibility of some sweet chemistry between Crystal and Tomei. That unravels of course when you realize that the scene is about Artie asking Alice what he and Diane did to make their daughter keep them at a distance and the movie has no good answer for his question. Parents it would appear cant get a break theyre the villains of most teen movies and now theyve got grandpa comedies sticking it to them at the other end. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Two grandparents take on three young charges only to discover that child-rearing aint what it used to be. BOTTOM LINE Crystal and Midler together for the first time are cozy as old slippers in this family-friendly comedy. No great shakes but occasionally amusing. CAST Billy Crystal Bette Midler Marisa Tomei LENGTH 145 ""Parental Guidance"" starring Billy Crystal and Bette Midler as old-fashioned grandparents taking on three thoroughly modern kids is nothing if not well-timed. It pokes fun at the new school of touchy-feely child-rearing and it arrives during a Christmas season strangely lacking in family fare. If youre looking for an all-ages crowd-pleaser this may be your best bet. Though only mildly amusing and slightly insightful ""Parental Guidance"" makes good use of Crystal 62 and Midler 67 appealing faces that have been largely absent from the movies of late. Crystal plays Artie Decker a cornball commentator for the minor league Fresno Grizzlies; Midler is his wife Diane a still-vivacious former weathergirl. They fit their roles well -- Crystal is a well-known baseball fan -- and also wear each other quite comfortably though this is their first film together. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Marisa Tomei plays their Atlanta-based daughter Alice a hover-mother to three aspirationally named but troubled children. Harper (Bailee Madison) is a self-flagellating vioilin prodigy Turner (Joshua Rush) has a stutter and Barker (Kyle Harrison Breitkopf) is bossed around by an imaginary friend. When Alice and her husband (Tom Everett Scott) take a much-needed vacation the elder Deckers fly in to watch the kids. Most of the jokes hinge on Arties inability to understand why tough love is out therapy is in and ""quit whining"" has become ""use your words."" To his horror even in Little League three strikes no longer mean out. ""But thats stupid"" Artie tells the ump. ""You know because of the song?"" Director Andy Fickman knows he cant side completely with the Deckers -- you didnt expect a Hollywood movie to advocate spanking did you? -- but ""Parental Guidance"" does its best to find a middle ground. For moviegoing families at the moment that might be enough. 215 VideoTrailer Parental Guidance PLOT Two grandparents take on three young charges only to discover that child-rearing aint what it used to be. advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING PG (mild rude humor) CAST Billy Crystal Bette Midler Marisa Tomei LENGTH 145 BOTTOM LINE Crystal and Midler together for the first time are cozy as old slippers in this family-friendly comedy.

Photo AP Regrettably arriving too late for The Posts annual Turkey Awards the old-geezers-know-best comedy ""Parental Guidance"" kicks off with a mean-spirited joke about an overweight woman and heads downhill from there. Artie (Billy Crystal) has just been canned from his longtime gig as a baseball announcer when he and wife Diane (Bette Midler) are called into service by their seldom-seen daughter Alice (Marisa Tomei). Her husband Phil (Tom Everett Scott) is up for an award for the fully-automated voice-activated house hes designed. While these ultra-modern parents fly out to the ceremony Artie and Diane will watch the couples three tightly wound kids (Bailee Madison Joshua Rush and Kyle Harrison Breitkopf). Playing like a big-screen adaptation of an Andy Rooney rant the movie bravely takes on the scourge of todays wimp-ified parenting. ""I think he breast-fed the kids"" Artie cracks to his wife about Phil. Because guys who nurture their kids arent real men Hilarious (Also no huge mystery why Alice keeps her distance.) Artie and Dianes initial gift of super-soakers for the grandkids isnt received all that warmly by Alice and Phil. What kind of messed-up parent doesnt want their kid to play with giant toy guns? Lunacy And when Alice informs her dad that they advise their children to ""use your words"" when theyre upset rather than telling them to quit whining Arties stupefied How do you get em to shut up then? Yes there are points to be made about how todays parents can run to tedious excesses and the challenges of bridging the chasm between two generations very different approaches to child-rearing. Those points are obscured when you punctuate scenes with Crystal getting whacked in the crotch with a baseball bat and puking on a little kids face. Small roles are in equally poor taste Gedde Watanabe shows up as the excitable owner of a Chinese food joint while skateboarding legend Tony Hawks cameo has him wiping out in a puddle of pee. And lets never speak again of the scene in which Crystal perches on a toilet with his grandson in a public bathroom singing ""Come out come out Mr. Doody."" Director Andy Fickman (""You Again"" tellingly) amps up the Rooney vibe for the movies resolution where all kid problems can be solved by playing Kick the Can listening to 1950s baseball announcer recordings and living in fear of a spanking. Just as they did in the good old days. To quote the man himself ""Life is like a roll of toilet paper. The closer you get to the end the faster it goes.""

"Parental Guidance review Suitable for no one | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesParental Guidance review Suitable for no one Unfunny Parental Guidance stars Billy Crystal and Bette Midler as old-school grandparents dealing with coddled grandkids.Grandpa and grandma played by perpetually mugging Billy Crystal and Bette Midler. Cue the revival of generation-gap jokes.  (Phil Caruso / 20th Century Fox)  By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterMon. Dec. 24 2012 Parental Guidance (out of 4) Starring Billy Crystal Bette Midler Marisa Tomei and Tom Everett Scott. Directed by Andy Fickman. 104 minutes. Opens Dec. 25 at major theatres. G Starring Bette Midlers frozen face and the ghost of Billy Crystals comic talent Parental Guidance achieves the impossible it makes The Guilt Trip look like high art. Director Andy Fickman (You Again Race to Witch Mountain) shows unexpected restraint by not delivering the first crotch joke -- Crystal gets it with a water gun -- until 22 minutes into the picture. He follows up with a baseball bat to Crystals nethers prompting him to barf into a kids face then moves on to a pooping song shared in a public restroom and skateboarder Tony Hawk wiping out in a slick of kiddie urine. Well done sir Crystal and Midler star as Artie and Diane Decker the less-popular grandparents of a trio of micromanaged kids doted on by their parents Alice (Marisa Tomei who should spend today firing her agent) and Phil (Tom Everett Scott). Artie as old school as fountain pens and pay phones is a laid-off play-by-play announcer for a minor league Fresno Calif. ball club. Former TV weather forecaster Diane dotes on her family but feels they takes a backseat to the more popular grandma and grandpa. So when Phil and a very reluctant Alice decide to head out of town for a week Artie and Diane are pressed into babysitting service. At least they would be if Alice would ever leave. But she cant bear to leave her dependent little darlings violin protege Harper (Bailee Madison who holds her own in the midst of much mugging by others) stuttering Turner (Joshua Rush) and fecal-fixated Barker (Kyle Harrison Breitkopf) who has an imaginary friend who is also a kangaroo. Oh yes he also insists on calling his grandpa ""Fartie."" The grandparents try it Alices way but the kiddie dictatorship rankles especially Artie who fires one-liners at the poppets like he was using them as target practice. No surprise Crystal is one of the producers of Parental Guidance; he clearly envisions a world where there is a resurgence of generation-gap humour. Unfunny and contrived sitcom-style hijinks follow as the grandparents face down the coddled kids. ""They dont eat sugar"" Alice warns. Cue the ice cream cake And what has Midler done to her face? At age 67 she looks eerily younger than 48-year-old Tomei whose maternal warmth and natural funny performance is the best thing about Parental Guidance. Written by Lisa Addario and Joe Syracuse who were among the six writers on 2007 animation Surfs Up Parental Guidance should be rated X -- suitable for no one.

(FOX) In the new family comedy ""Parental Guidance"" Mom and Dad have a rule - every putdown anyone utters has to be quickly followed by three nice compliments. So OK here goes in reverse. This movie happily brings Billy Crystal and Bette Midler back after long absences and casts them as those rare Hollywood characters the Believably Married Age-Appropriate Couple (in real life hes 64 shes 67). It also takes some appreciated (if not exactly fresh) shots at over-indulged children and under-assertive parents and those crunchy-granola families where everything is permitted except the word ""No."" And it gives Midler a - too brief - chance to sing. Now the putdown - the movie just isnt very good. The story stars Crystal as a minor-league baseball announcer with Midler as his former ""weather-girl"" wife. Theyre a bit estranged from their only daughter but when she needs a weeks worth of emergency babysitting they rush into the breach. Also into a politically correct parentally incorrect household where the children rule - and yet nobody seems very happy. Its a slightly obvious set up but apparently thats the way the hacktastic filmmakers want it (the script was reportedly rewritten by a couple of old sitcom veterans and Crystal allies). Subtlety is nowhere to be found. But also missing sadly are any big jokes. Oh there are several bits of bathroom humor - a bit too many actually for a PG film - including a scene of someone vomiting on someone else. What wit. Some comic situations are set up and then forgotten about; some crises clumsily manufactured. But the laughs just arent there. Crystal works very hard and - being a diehard baseball fan - seems happiest in the scenes which require him to do play-by-play or simply talk about his love of the game. Midler is lively too although she has less to do (and if youre going to give her one song please couldnt it have been something more challenging than ""The Book of Love""?) But apart from the tremulously vulnerable and terrifically winning Bailee Madison as 12-year-old Harper the cast is mostly bland. And little Kyle Harrison Breitkopf is a tooth-grinding pain as the youngest son whos supposed to be an adorable little terror and comes off instead as a nearly unbearable horror. Eventually of course all is resolved. The oldsters connect with the youngsters; the parents return to realize that gosh sometimes grandfather really does know best. Everything ends in applause and hugs and snapshots and smiles. But not soon enough. Ratings note The film contains some vulgar humor. Parental Guidance (PG) Fox (104 min.) Directed by Andy Fickman. With Billy Crystal Bette Midler. Now playing in New Jersey.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Billy Crystal was born a sappy old Jewish man. He undoubtedly tumbled out of the womb already nursing a deep nostalgia for the good old days when Frank Sinatra crooned with Tommy Dorsey Joe DiMaggio patrolled center field for Gods own New York Yankees and nothing in the world tasted better than a hot dog at Yankee Stadium on a Sunday afternoon with the folks. The young Crystal wasnt mature or precocious so much as corny and old-fashioned even as a young man with a stand-up act redolent of the Catskills. Now after an exceedingly welcome extended stay away from the multiplexes--think of all the terrible movies society avoided by virtue of his absence--Crystals chronological age has caught up with his perpetually geriatric sensibility; hes a doddering senior citizen on the outside as well as the inside. Consequently hes perfectly suited to produce and star in the wholesome family comedy Parental Guidance which might as well be called AARP Presents Billy Crystal Is Old And Whats Going On With All The Facebooking And Twittering And iPods? In a role that suits him as snugly as an old pair of slippers that should be thrown away Crystal plays a husband and father of a certain age whose life revolves around his job as a minor-league baseball announcer until his boss fires him for being insufficiently adroit with Twitter and Facebook. Crystal falls into an exceedingly minor funk until he has an opportunity to bond with his grandchildren after skittish mother Marisa Tomei reluctantly agrees to leave them in the care of Crystal and wife Bette Midler another show-business lifer who treats her puzzled progeny with the same brassy razzamatazz that wowed them at the bathhouses in the early 1970s. Crystal isnt the only element of Parental Guidance that is hilariously dated. Change a few already-tired details like iPhone apps the X-Games and a cameo from Tony Hawk (the films idea of a hip young celebrity all the kids are grooving on) and Parental Guidance could just as easily be a film from the 1970s about 1950s New York parents dealing with the kooky hippie parenting of the younger generation or a 1980s culture-clash farce about loveable traditionalists coping with New Age parents who favor touchy-feely therapy-speak instead of good old-fashioned spanking. But the films ham-fisted oscillation between schmaltz and scatology indelibly marks it as a product of Crystals hokey mothballed sensibility. He never needs an excuse to lay on the sentimentality and Parental Guidance sees no reason a film cant shoehorn in a life lesson every 10 minutes between crude gags involving peeing Crystal vomiting on a small child after taking a bat to the testicles and a lot of tired business centering on an imaginary kangaroo and Gedde Watanabe continuing his careerlong tribute to Mickey Rooney in Breakfast At Tiffanys. Crystal hasnt improved with age hes atrophied. And Parental Guidance is the abysmal grandpa/grandkids bonding comedy hes been destined to make since he first started creating new comedy with an unmistakable old-person smell.

And while its senior stars do a terrific job capturing aging in a youth-crazed culture Guidance drops the ball in all departments in its portrayal of anyone younger than 55.Billy Crystal plays Artie Decker a quick-witted minor league baseball announcer who dreams of broadcasting San Francisco Giants games.His wife Diane (Bette Midler) plays the dutiful spouse and does a nice job consoling her husband who gets fired because he cant tweet and wouldnt know a hashtag from a hash brown.But when their only daughter Alice (Marisa Tomei) invites them to Atlanta to watch the kids for a few days the wheels come off.Directed by Andy Fickman (Shes the Man The Game Plan)Guidance is one of the years more manic films. But Fickman manages some heartfelt moments when Artie and Diane confess their fears of aging. Artie concedes he needs a Walter Mitty dream to give his days purpose. Just as touching Diane admits her fear of being ""the other grandparents"" the distant fuddy-duddy seniors kids dread hosting.But for every nerve Guidance hits it bludgeons the audience with characters who could come from a Mentos ad.Dad Phil (Tom Everett Scott) is an inventor who has created a talking house that is really an elaborate punchline blender. Tomei is oddly cast as a daughter raised by two thoughtful parents yet who seems embarrassed by the loving couple.The children in particular are throwaway characters. Theres the over-achieving daughter (Bailee Madison) the stuttering son (Joshua Rush) and hell-raising youngest sibling (Kyle Harrison Breitkopf). They all just need to be told to ""chill out"" by Grandpa. Even kids may find the high jinks tame and the cutesy grins too saccharine.Guidance has the requisite physical slapstick of family films as body functions go awry and food finds every orifice but the mouth. None of this distinguishes it from say a Tyler Perry film.Which is a shame because Midler and Crystal are strong. Crystal in particular lets his love of baseball show (he participated in Ken Burns documentary Baseball) and you get the feeling hed have been a good play-by-play man.Yet the movie spends too much time wedging the couple into a May-December moment where Crystal cracks nostalgic about the good old days. Its sweet but it grows old. 9 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/RM1EEO",http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~r/UsatodaycomMovies-TopStories/~3/Famt738n7zk/,200,parentalguidance18,parentalguidance,usatoday

TWITTER Billy Crystal and Bette Midler hustle to peddle the threadbare material that makes Andy Fickmans comedy a perfectly tolerable if uninspired moviegoing experience. The schmaltz is piled on thick and if the comedy were any broader it would require an Imax screen but still theres something touching about how hard Billy Crystal and Bette Midler hustle to peddle the threadbare material that makes Parental Guidance a perfectly tolerable if uninspired moviegoing experience. PHOTOS Holiday Stuffing Why Long Movies Hit the Box Office This Season As ""the other grandparents"" who are given a golden opportunity to bond with their seldom-seen grandchildren Billy and Bette work double time well aware that its not just the juvenile characters they have to entertain but also the paying audiences who could count on both of them for a good laugh back in the day. That they manage to pull their weight even when the achingly formulaic plotting threatens to drag them under is a testament to their ""lets-put-on-a-show"" spirit. The end result should appeal to audiences including bonding grandparents and grandkids looking for a little undemanding holiday cheer. Crystal is Artie Decker who has just lost his longtime gig as ""De Voice of the Fresno Grizzlies"" when the minor-league baseball team decided to upgrade the outfit with the sort of talent that knows its way around a Facebook page or a Twitter account. Already despondent hes not exactly jumping up and down over the news that he and his wife Diane (Midler) have been recruited to babysit their daughter Alices (Marisa Tomei) three kids when she and her tech-geek husband Phil (Tom Everett Scott) get a last-minute opportunity to have some out-of-town alone time. As expected uptight Alices no-sugar-allowed helicopter parenting clashes mightily with Artie and Dianes old-school approach to child-rearing not to mention the fact that Phil has programmed his smart home to be intuitive within an inch of its inhabitants lives. Also as expected are the resulting gags built around technologically challenged Artie. Fortunately old pro Crystal comes armed with an arsenal of rim-shot-ready rejoinders that hit the mark more than they miss. GUEST COLUMN Barbra Streisand Bette Midler New Movies and Noses A Sitcom Writers Jew Review While his character has been given more of an emotional arc than Midlers (unsurprising since the genesis of Parental Guidance came from a newly minted grandparenting experience in producer Crystals life) its still nice to see Midler strutting her stuff in her first onscreen comedy role in years. And Tomei is always a welcome presence even when shes saddled with whats essentially a one-note character for most of the film. It would have been nice if director Andy Fickman (Race to Witch Mountain) and husband-and-wife screenwriters Lisa Addario and Joe Syracuse (Surfs Up) could have mined some fresher stuff from this frequently played ballgame but at least when youve got Crystal calling the shots you can still count on the occasional change-up.

The scriptwriters however dont appear to have taken it to heart. Seemingly found languishing in a studio vault from around 1988 - with then-bankable stars Bette Midler and Billy Crystal having aged Dorian Gray-style in celluloid - it at least offers some sort of narrative alibi for its litany of dated blearily delivered punchlines. Midler and Crystal play out-of-touch retirees looking to bond with their estranged grandchildren when their neurotic Type-A daughter (the wonderful Marisa Tomei desperately seeking to add more to the role than hair and a handbag) and son-in-law call on them to babysit for a week. The three kids who range from precocious to positively psychotic are wary of the intruding oldsters - as well they might be given that the eerily preserved Granny Bette and Grandpa Billy can scarcely move one facial muscle between them. The latest in a long run of 2012 films to confront the indignities of ageing this one is arguably if not intentionally the most harrowing. Needless to say it all comes drippily right in the end as the dynamic duo gradually teach the children the joys of granola-free living via the usual assortment of pained pratfalls potty humour and in one particularly toe-curling musical number 1950s doo-wop music. Watching this pair of formerly spry comic forces shuffle around the kitchen yowling Book of Love at each other you may well need to use your words... if you can even find them.

Sure this isnt a great film it isnt even good but it is better than the review makes out. Ok the plotline is cliched and there are a number of big mistakes such as Billys woeful attempt to get down with the kids at the X games. In places the film does really annoy and the importance of baseball to a family will go over the heads of many here in the UK but the real story is about the separation of generations and particularly those in their 60s and 70s and their 30 to 40 year old kids. I am not the films target audience but there were more than enough of them to perhaps give the film a reasonable opening week and certainly more than were in the cinema when I have watched many so called ""better"" movies. It is an OK 2 star film that lays it on thick and syrupy and when it sees a gag hits it out of the park unsubtly. Best viewed if you are over 60 and have grandkids. Otherwise maybe see something else. An adequate 2 star film soon to be forgotten.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 29 2012SueFeaturedI enjoyed it.

"Parental Guidance | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Review Parental Guidance Brian Lowry Chief TV Critic blowryontv 0 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr December 21 2012 | 1000AM PT Pic could yield reasonable returns as an inoffensive alternative to Oscar bait and epics but even on those terms ""Parental Guidance"" is not suggested. From a distance strictly as a demographic/marketing proposition ""Parental Guidance"" appears pretty shrewdly constructed a light-hearted movie about grandparents and kids designed to softly appeal to the holiday audience at both extremes as well as those parents sandwiched between them. The execution alas prevents this from being a genuine crowdpleaser with the better moments (mostly of the schmaltzy variety) more than offset by the irritating and tedious ones. Pic could still yield reasonable returns as an inoffensive alternative to Oscar bait and epics but even on those terms ""Parental Guidance"" is not suggested. Functioning as producer and star Billy Crystal manages to work in some mildly amusing shtick along the way in his capacity as a minor-league baseball announcer albeit one who loses his longtime gig in the early going. Yet Crystals Artie and his wife Diane (Bette Midler) have grown distant from their sole child Alice (Marisa Tomei) so theyre as surprised as anybody when their daughter and her hubby (Tom Everett Scott) -- in a sure sign that theres no other option -- enlist these less favored grandparents to watch the kids while they escape on a work-related trip. Its the kids frankly where ""Parental Guidance"" mostly breaks down not because the three young actors (Bailee Madison Joshua Rush and Kyle Harrison Breitkopf) are bad but because their quirks and means of acting out are so unrelatable petulant or simply annoying. In addition director Andy Fickman and writers Lisa Addario and Joe Syracuse cant really settle on go-to gags or a consistent tone. So while the movie threatens to get mileage out of the ""prototype smart house"" in which the family lives which flummoxes Artie the bit mostly founders. The same goes for the notion of Arties old-fashioned ideas butting up against (and triumphing over) New Age self-esteem-building ""We dont keep score when our kids play baseball"" parenting. The movie also drops the ball on what could actually have provided greater depth -- namely how someone like Artie whose identity is so wrapped up in his job deals with being separated from it. Even a sequence involving his audition to broadcast the X Games feels less like a case of an older guy grasping for a lifeline than a mere pander to kids and teens down to the cameo by skateboarding legend Tony Hawk. Dim the star wattage and theres precious little to distinguish this from the average Hallmark Channel movie (including Marc Shaimans score). True Crystal Midler and Tomei conjure a few heartwarming exchanges -- with the first two even teaming on a semi-gratuitous song -- but instead of hewing toward ""Parenthood"" the film keeps lurching toward farcical sequences that fall flat. Small wonder ""Parental Guidance"" winds up resorting to pee poop and vomit in what begins to look like comedic desperation. (On the plus side that ""rude humor"" is responsible for the ""PG"" rating so at least theres a bingo on that front.) Frankly the movies best idea waits until the closing credits which feature pictures of key cast and crew members with their families adding a closing dollop of sweetness -- and making it more difficult to borrow one of Crystals baseball metaphors to tee off on them. Still theres a telling line toward the end when -- amid a particularly chaotic family encounter -- the young daughter groans ""We are so past weird."" By then shes right. But unfortunately just not close enough to good. Parental GuidanceProductionA 20th Century Fox release presented with Walden Media of a Chernin Entertainment/Face Prods. production.
