"A new spin on Charlottes Web - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies A new spin on Charlottes Web By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  December 15 2006 The new live-action version of ""Charlottes Web"" has a weight problem. Its obese with talent.The real animatronic and digitally enhanced farm critters all sound like famous people. Oprah Winfrey performs the voice of the mother goose figure Gussy. Cedric the Entertainer is her mate Golly. Robert Redford is Ike the horse. Kathy Bates and Reba McEntire do the voices of the cows Bitsy and Bessie. Steve Buscemi is Templeton the rat. John Cleese is Samuel the sheep. Supplied with E.B. Whites ever eloquent 54-year-old prose Sam Shepard narrates. And holy of holies Julia Roberts is the divine Charlotte A. Cavatica that crafty spider who devotes herself to saving her pig pal Wilbur from the slab.If this sounds like inspired fun in the telling (and my does it) the movie is a chore to watch. Live-action is a nominal description since much of the film is a point-and-shoot affair. The camera rests patiently in front of a particular animal while the famous person speaks and because there is only so much say a live goose can do in a gauzy close-up Winfreys stuttering down-home intonations overwhelm the shot.This wasnt so with the animated version from 1973. There was harmony between voice and image. The fantastical particulars of that cartoon have hardened into this new movies dusty approximation of actual farm life. Belching selfish and full of bad puns Templeton the Rat may have been partly whipped up by a computer but the slop in which he swims looks pretty real.Dutifully directed by Gary Winick and adapted by Susannah Grant and Karey Kirkpatrick  this live-action version holds on to Whites morality -- but that and advances in animation are all the movie has to justify itself. In the opening scenes young human Fern (Dakota Fanning) discovers one night that her father (Kevin Anderson) is about to slaughter a newborn runt. ""If I had been born small would you have killed me?"" she demands vowing to love and care for the piglet herself. To the dismay of her mother (Essie Davis)  Fern names it Wilbur and takes him to school and pushes him in a carriage. (Fanning gives the part surreal emotional conviction; does she know Fern is 12 and not 42?)In no time Wilbur grows too big for bottles and baths in the kitchen sink and is shipped to Ferns uncles farm where the pig starts talking (10-year-old Dominic Scott Kay gives it his endearingly chipper all). Between visits from Fern Wilbur makes new barnyard friends including Charlotte who know all too well that pigs like Wilbur are doomed. So do we. Right after Fern promises Wilbur that ""I absolutely will not let them kill you"" we get a crude comic shot of bacon sizzling in a pan. In any case Charlotte selflessly concocts schemes to keep Wilbur from a similar fate She tells the world hes special.Both this adaptation and Roberts make Charlotte instantly lovable. But in reading Whites story all those years ago I remember being touched by Charlottes almost desperate loneliness and her over-eagerness to have a new friend. Roberts as lovely as she makes Charlotte is the only actor in the cast not playing her assigned critter. Hovering high above it all shes playing Julia Roberts. While there are plenty of touching moments this Charlotte is missing the early chill Debbie Reynolds induced in the 1973 version.Most of the movies creative juice has gone into that digitally conceived spider too. Charlottes web-spinning is the movies visual high point. Everything else photographed in the barn besides the shenanigans in Templetons lair feels dead on screen.Nonetheless this is preferable to the new-agey action-adventure that Whites ""Stuart Little"" became seven years ago. And where the camera has been placed may not be something the average elementary-schooler cares about anyway. Indeed woe be to the child who doesnt mist up at this movie since its been made if not with zip wit or imagination then at least with sweetness. But I hope no one will think the film is an adequate replacement for Whites book. That would be a crime.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

"Charlottes Web | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; charlotte-s-web ) Charlottes Web (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli As family features go Charlottes Web may be the best we have seen in a while. Technically adept and surprisingly affecting the movie translates E.B. Whites childrens book into a motion picture that will enthrall children and engage their parents. The animals come to life with enough credibility that its not out of the question that a few tears may be shed for a CGI creature. Strangely even with plucky Dakota Fanning fronting for the human actors the film loses some of its magic when it moves outside of the barn. Comparisons to Babe are expected and warranted but one thing missing form this story is James Cromwell. Since its 1952 publication Charlottes Web has been a childrens favorite. It rests on many bookshelves alongside Whites other books (which include Stuart Little). The 1973 release of an animated version widened the appeal of Charlotte Wilbur and Fern. This new movie is an attempt to bring the story to todays audiences. Perhaps those who enjoy the movie will seek out the book. Charlottes Web isnt as popular as it was decades ago because reading had taken a back seat to the many other distractions available to children. On the night of his birth runt of the litter Wilbur (voice of Dominic Scott Kay) is saved from the ax by Fern (Dakota Fanning) who promises to keep the newly born pig safe. When Wilbur becomes too large to keep as a pet she sells him to her uncle who owns a barn across the street. Hes close enough that she can visit him every day but Fern isnt aware that Wilburs ultimate destination is the smokehouse so he can be ready to be served for dinner on Christmas Day. In the barn Wilbur becomes acquainted with the other residents Templeton the rat (voice of Steve Buscemi) Samuel the sheep (voice of John Cleese) Ike the horse (Robert Redford) and Gussy and Golly the geese (voices of Oprah Winfrey and Cedric the Entertainer). While these animals are stand-offish there is one creature in the barn who makes friends with the lonely pig Charlotte the spider (voice of Julia Roberts). Her efforts in particular will be vital in keeping Wilbur alive long enough to see the winter snows. Her idea convince the farmers that their new pig is too valuable to be used as pork. The CGI animals are rendered with such care that many viewers will swear theyre real creatures. (In fact they sometimes are but figuring out where the computer animators become involved is a perplexing proposition. Thats how good the finished product is.) Charlotte is a curious mix of the creepy and the comforting. She looks like a spider but the close-ups of her face soften the negative impressions many have when dealing with arachnids and the soothing familiar tones of Julia Roberts voice further humanize Charlotte. A great deal of care was taken in making sure children wouldnt be made uneasy by the spider while still allowing her to be recognizable as what she is. Most of the other animals appear as they are. In playing Fern the talented Fanning is given a thankless job and the lackluster actors around her dont provide much support. The people in this movie are far less developed than their animal counterparts and the only time when Fern comes alive is when shes with her pig. Attempts to broaden her character by giving her a quasi-boyfriend and building up her family dont work. Ultimately we only care about Fern as she relates to Wilbur and that means being his 1 human supporter when it comes to keeping him out of the smoke house. Usage of computer animation to effectively blend animals and people hasnt been done with any regularity possibly because the penalties for failure are dire. The most notable examples of this working are the aforementioned Babe and its sequel but with Charlottes Web director Gary Winick nails the accomplishment and the result is pleasant to watch. Charlottes Web has all the requisite elements that a family film needs to succeed and endure humor drama pathos and an emotionally satisfying ending. Despite its flaws none of which are burdensome Charlottes Web deserves to thrive both now in theaters and in the years to come on DVD.

Some spider. Some movie. Charlottes Web weaves magic. 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Charlottes Web Family film. Starring Dakota Fanning; voiced by Julia Roberts Dominic Scott Kay Steve Buscemi and Robert Redford; and narrated by Sam Shepard. Directed by Gary Winick. (G. 98 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Once upon a time author E.B. White came up with an inspired idea -- if you build it they will come. His ""it"" was no field of dreams but a delicate web spun by a kindly spider to call attention to a lowly pig. ""Charlottes Web"" a splendid new screen adaptation of Whites 1952 childrens book gloriously brings the classic to life. If youve never read it this is a perfect introduction and if you have youll be impressed with how effectively director Gary Winick and screenwriters Susannah Grant and Karey Kirkpatrick capture Whites message about love and loyalty among all of Gods creatures without ever getting syrupy. Theres an edge to this exemplary family movie just as there is in the story. An unlikely friendship develops when runty Wilbur moves into a New England barn presided over from high up top by Charlotte. All the animals know that the new resident is destined for the slaughterhouse but only the spider vows to save Wilburs life. In one of many spellbinding moments sure to entrap adults as well as kids Charlotte spins the words ""some pig"" out of glistening silk the letters slowly emerging like skywriting. News of her miraculous web spreads and families come from all around to stare at it with the awe usually reserved for a religious vision. Wilburs star status rescues him at least temporarily. Just as White was prescient about what would draw a crowd he also understood the intrinsic appeal of a baby pig decades before ""Babe."" Wilbur is just the cutest little thing all pinkish and cuddly. His very adorableness is what makes your heart sink each time it appears hes about to become bacon. His first savior Fern (perkily played by the ubiquitous Dakota Fanning) spots his star quality at birth and persuades her father not to hack him into pieces just because hes the runt of the litter. Christening him Wilbur she keeps him at home as a pet until her family deems a barn more appropriate. The filmmakers wisest decision was not to rely on computer-generated effects. Wilbur is a live animal as is most of the barnyard menagerie. Seeing actual horses cows and sheep go about their business lends credibility to the farm scenes. The animals have been enhanced by computer animators and given voices by a talented cast led by Julia Roberts whose Charlotte conveys just the right motherly tone (perhaps the one Roberts uses around her twins) and by 10-year-old Dominic Scott Kay (Tom Cruises son in ""Minority Report"") whose ability to express Wilburs joy at staying alive makes you appreciate anew what a wonderful gift that is. Robert Redford lends his voice of experience to a snide old workhorse and Steve Buscemi channels the self-important way a rat might sound if it were surrounded by large beasts and trying to act as if size doesnt matter. And speaking of voices Sam Shepards craggy one is perfect to narrate this timeless tale. Its like having your grandfather read to you. The county fair where Fern brings Wilbur in the hope that a blue ribbon might be his ticket to longevity is lovingly created. When Fern catches the eye of a cute boy who buys her a roller coaster ticket its suddenly obvious that her affection for a pig may soon be transferred elsewhere. Another of Whites timeless messages astutely captured in the movie is that nothing is forever including life and to make the best of the moment. Listening to Wilbur squeal in delight might tempt you to do the same just for the heck of it.

Photo Paramount Pictures Charlottes Web 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Charlottes Web adapts a classic which is not to say it is one. Retelling the beloved childrens yarn its warmly entertaining if not enthralling. Based on E.B. Whites 1952 book Charlottes Web is the sweet fable of a feisty little pig whos befriended by a plucky girl and adopted by a lovable maternal spider. Wait a second. Lovable spider? Were talking the creepiest of bugs right with eight legs mandibles poisonous fangs bulging belly sticky webs and extra eyes in weird places? Were talking -- ick -- a spider? Of course its fantasy and it worked in Whites illustrated book. It also worked in hand-drawn animation in 1973. But putting a big fat hairy spider in a mostly live-action film is unsettling -- even in a tender tale and even when its gently voiced by Julia Roberts. Dont get me wrong. This film has ample magic and a good heart as it faithfully adapts Whites story of friendship changing seasons and the circle of life. A botched Cat in the Hat its not. Shot among big red barns and cheery white farmhouses in pastoral Australia Charlottes Web has a sunny retro charm that evokes Whites 1950s New England. Though dialogue is delicately updated the film largely feels preserved in near-past timelessness. Live actors are secondary to the secretly talkative farm critters. Even Dakota Fanning as young heroine Fern appears only briefly. But our furry and feathered friends compensate. Most are actual animals with animated mouths Babe-style. Theyre cute and theyre a hoot thanks to Whites wit and a strong voice cast that includes Kathy Bates as a catty cow Cedric the Entertainer as a daffy goose John Cleese as a wary sheep and Steve Buscemi as a gluttonous rat. Adorable Wilbur is played by 47 piggies and voiced with whimsy and personality by Dominic Scott Kay. Fanning is fine but basically recycles her crusading farm-girl role from last years Dreamer. More important Whites ode to kindness and friendship remains intact. You want your kids to learn more about loyalty? Charlottes Web isnt a bad place to look. Its mirth is also broadly age-friendly. Sidestepping sentiment director Gary Winick punches up humor while keeping gags tame. Two crazy crows are a stitch and Buscemis rodent is both comical and conflicted. But that spider -- it bugs me. Though computer-animated Charlotte looks real and in close-ups she mirrors the menacing arachnids of Eight Legged Freaks and other fright fare. To be fair Charlotte is a sweetheart in her deeds if not her inherent creepiness. Selflessly adopting runty Wilbur she tries to save him from slaughter by spinning wondrous words on webs to convince humans hes special. Well not that wondrous. ""Some pig"" isnt exactly poetry. And it does seem strange that folks avidly flock to the site as if an image of Jesus had appeared on a screen door. Theyre just web words after all -- like spotting a bunny in a cloud -- and the miracle is that no one questions their authenticity. But its the thought that counts and the thoughts here are good Friendship should be cherished and its vital to keep your word. There. I feel better. I just wish I could erase those memories of Charlottes blankly staring eyes and the hundreds of baby spiders spewing from a bulging egg sac to crawl across the faces of ... No. Thats it. Im done.

Whites ""Charlottes Web."" He began reading the first page of the famed story about a runty pig and the females who save him Fern Arable a farm girl and Charlotte a gray spider. When he landed on the final sentence- ""Ferns sneakers were sopping by the time she caught up with her father"" - he beamed. Some page. ""Some Pig"" you may recall is the first message Charlotte weaves in hopes of saving Wilbur. Humans slow to learn recognize the miracle but still think a spring pig will make many a fine meal come winter. So other dispatches in silken thread follow. Fifty-four years later Whites wonder-work remains vibrant. It is a brilliant lesson in languages life-giving magic as well as a generous primer about friendship and a vital lesson in rural riches. At times winning but hardly a classic Gary Winicks big-screen version of ""Charlottes Web"" adapted by Susannah Grant and Kerry Kirkpatrick approaches its initial set-up from a slightly different vantage. After a prologue relating the ways in which the ordinary and the extraordinary meet the movie takes us into the Arable barn. There a sow has given birth. Depending on how you see things shes one teat short or one piglet too many. Ferns dad (Kevin Anderson) picks up the pig and an ax. Fern (Dakota Fanning) pleads Wilburs case. A newborn is saved. While not as literary the scene to its credit is nearly as economical in laying out the movies emotional terrain. Yet the tugging problem with this ""Charlottes Web"" is that it never finds a consistent cinematic langauge to match Whites though Danny Elfmans score comes close. This is not merely a purists lament; childrens films require a higher standard of wonder. The computer-generated Charlotte (voiced by Julia Roberts) remains the bestower of lovely words. Some like ""salutations"" and ""languish"" are for Wilbur. Others - ""radiant"" and ""humble"" - reach a larger audience. Steven Buscemi provides the grousing voice of Templeton the Rat. A scavenger but also a catalyst the rodent never becomes quite likable - and in spite of himself he should. With its often seamless digital effects this G-rated film has a number of smile-inducing pleasures Wilbur does flips; the arachnophobic horse Ike (voiced by Robert Redford) falls faint; Charlottes progeny float away peeping ""We take to the breeze we go as we please."" For all the A-list voice talent (Oprah Winfrey and Cedric the Entertainer as geese John Cleese as a sheep Reba McEntire and Kathy Bates as cows) its Dominic Scott Kays stuffy-nosed sweet Wilbur who endears. ""Great name"" the pink pig exclaims each time he makes a new acquaintance. Some will bristle at liberties taken. Cows do indeed break wind. Yet the movies use of flatulence is less a nod to rural truths than a reliance on what has become a go-to gag in movies made for the booster-seat set. (A primer for ""Borat"" perhaps?) During the film it was easy to imagine an alternative update of Whites classic. Granted its even more sacrilegious ""Charlottes Website"" in which a blogging arachnid makes the world care about the fate of a pig.

"Charlottes Web reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Charlottes Web reviewed. Charlottes Web reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 14 2006 621 PM Flavorless Ham A faithful but bland Charlottes Web. By Dana Stevens Wilbur looks forward to Charlottes Web Charlottes Web isnt just a great childrens book its a great book period and great literature is notoriously hard to adapt for the big screen. Gary Winicks new version (Paramount) is almost cravenly faithful to the letter of the 1952 novel by E.B. White but it cant translate the spirit of Whites sober humanism not to mention the dry crackle of his prose. Maybe that would be too much to ask of any film. The dingy-looking 1973 Hanna-Barbera animated version had some nice voicework but it was nothing to weave ""terrific"" into your web about. Dakota Fanning is ideal for Fern the animal-mad piglet-saving heroine--she even resembles Garth Williams famous drawings for the novel. After performing onscreen for half of her 12 years on earth youd think Fanning might have a hardened quality by now but she brings Fern to life with a quiet sweetness and truly seems to be enjoying herself with the animals on set. Advertisement Maybe thats because the animals Fanning was interacting were actually there rather than waiting to be created against a green screen. The filmmaker wisely chose to bring the Zuckermans barn to life Babe-style using living critters and digitally endowing them with speech. And true to the current trend of celebrities lining up to do animated voice work this is one A-list farmyard. Julia Roberts who had just had her twins when filming began brings an earthy maternal quality to Charlotte the spider but the standout is Steve Buscemi as Templeton the greedy rat who agrees to help Wilbur in exchange for first dibs on the swill in his trough. On the films Web site Buscemi voices mild hurt that people are constantly telling him hes ""perfect"" for the role of Templeton. Thats a backhanded compliment to be sure but Buscemi does seem to have found his way into the rodents mind. He plays the role less broadly and more richly than Paul Lynde in the 1973 film and makes Templeton into the storys unexpected hero. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The celebrity-packed barn also includes Robert Redfords spider-phobic horse John Cleeses wonderfully snooty sheep and a pair of squabbling married geese voiced (somewhat annoyingly) by Oprah Winfrey and Cedric the Entertainer. Wilbur the pigs voice is that of child actor Dominic Scott Kay who shone as Kyra Sedgwicks overindulged son in Loverboy but who veers toward the cloying here. The bone-dry narration by Sam Shepard is one of the highlights of the movie perhaps because in those moments Whites voice comes through to us unaltered. Charlottes Web is for the most part a scrupulously tasteful rendering of a childrens classic (though it does comply with the industry bylaw that every kids film contain at least one fart joke). But the brand of childhood wonder the movie traffics in is just a little sweeter a little louder a little busier than Whites and that shade of coarsening makes all the difference. To paraphrase the novels famous last lines its not often a story comes along that can make for both a great book and a wonderful movie. Charlottes Web isnt both.

"Charlottes Web A Fine-Spun Retelling washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Charlottes Web A Fine-Spun Retelling The runt you can root for Fern (Dakota Fanning) bonds with Wilbur (voiced by Dominic Scott Kay) in the gentle -- and winning -- new remake of E.B. Whites classic tale. (By Lisa Tomasetti -- Paramount Pictures) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday December 15 2006 It may not have the perkiness of ""Babe"" that hoof-warming winner of 1995 but ""Charlottes Web"" -- another movie featuring an animatronic pig -- plays to its biggest strength the magic of a good story simply told. E.B. Whites childrens book -- starring Wilbur the curly-tailed runt his human friend Fern and that spinner of silky acclamations  Charlotte -- has been charming kids into bed since Dwight Eisenhower was president. Those kids who passed it along to their children can rest assured the movie featuring Dakota Fanning and an off-screen cast that includes Julia Roberts Oprah Winfrey and Robert Redford shares their reverence. Produced by Paramount and Walden Media -- the educational multimedia outfit that also brought you ""Holes"" and ""The Chronicles of Narnia The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe"" -- the movie feels old-fashioned but not dated savvy but not snarky. Director Gary Winick (""13 Going on 30"") seems mostly to have instructed his actors to stay out of the storys way. But even if the performers at times sound as if theyre doing a casual read-through before the actual show their relaxed spirit is subtly satisfying. (And frankly its a respite not to have the likes of Robin Williams voicing characters in a postmodern fever sweat.) ""Charlottes Web"" also bypasses all that riffing and referencing that has become the pop culture uber alles mantra of so many films from Pixar and its various imitators. There are some of us for whom the mere sight of Fanning evinces a groan -- shes been the go-to Cute Girl for more movies than wed care to remember. But as Fern mercifully shes just right a sweet-natured bighearted kid whose only motivation is the well-being of her adopted pet. That Meryl Streep Jr. authority -- the young actresss frosty professionalism which has made us wonder if shes actually experienced childhood -- stays dormant. Instead we delight in her disarmingly funny moments -- literally trying to keep the lid on her rambunctious piglet in class or wheeling him around town in a pram. Shes a girl again. Wed like to point out -- before we give the impression ""Charlottes Web"" will induce audiences to slumber -- that Wilbur and his barnyard friends move with the same snappy fluidity of Babe and his counterparts. We enjoy snouts maws and jaws moving in perfect sync with human words -- its as though were watching live-action cartoons. And its fun to watch Wilbur splashing in mud puddles or trying repeatedly to ram a wooden fence with the slapstick resilience of a Keystone Kop. The animatronic style is a cut above those flicks of yore in which animals did the walking while off-screen humans did the talking (remember the 1973 musical version of ""Charlottes Web"" featuring the voices of Debbie Reynolds as Charlotte and Paul Lynde as Templeton the rat?). This version feels almost quaint practically hands-on in light of the computer-generated thrill rides that dominate most animation films. Thats no shortcoming -- quite the opposite in fact. The lack of technological fireworks gives audiences the opportunity to concentrate on the integrity of the story in which farm girl Fern saves Wilbur -- the unwanted 11th pig of a 10-teated mom. And it better highlights the storys thoughtful themes Charlottes justification for instance for her killing and uh blood-sucking of flies (circle of life kids) and Wilburs appreciation of the spiders inner beauty. (To some of us though spiders will always be spiders even if they do talk like Julia Roberts.) Remember the peaceful atmosphere of bedtime storytelling? The kind that allows parent and child to take satisfaction in the story not the teller? Thats how ""Charlotte"" draws you into its web. Charlottes Web (98 minutes at area theaters) is rated G.

Comments Charlottes Web The E.B. White classic about a young pig who fears the frying pan and a spider who spins promotional billboards to save him was first adapted to the screen in 1973 as a bad Hanna-Barbera animation with such sterling voice talents as Agnes Moorehead Henry Gibson Pamelyn Ferdin and Paul Lynde as Templeton the rat. This passable live-action feature from Christian mogul Philip Anschutz (The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe) also relies heavily on the voices though the actors are sometimes miscast (Julia Roberts as the spider) or chosen more for their on-screen personas than their pipes (Steve Buscemi as the rat). Gary Winick (13 Going On 30) directed; among the barnyard animals are Robert Redford John Cleese Oprah Winfrey and Cedric the Entertainer. G 97 min. By J.R.

White or that they were the two quietest books Id ever encountered. White in his sublimely dotty illustrated talking-animal novels conjured a gossamer dream of an earlier gentler America a tweedy soothing often rural place too chock-full of homespun eccentrics to teeter into quaintness. That his heroes were critters who spoke and had feelings just like the humans around them somehow seemed the most commonsense thing in the world a natural extension of that lyrical decency. Hollywood of course has already had its way with Stuart Little turning him into the mighty mouse of his own pow-zap universe and there was every reason to assume that the new animatronic Charlottes Web might receive the same brash born-to-merchandise treatment. Its indeed a bit noisy with a soundtrack that lays on the poky good cheer and the animals in the barn rib each other a tad frenetically with their multiethnic celebrity voices. Once the story settles in though a little miracle occurs The director Gary Winick (13 Going on 30) puts the book in all its glorious tall-tale reverence right up on screen. What hooks you from the start is Dakota Fannings unfussy passion as Fern the young farm girl who rescues Wilbur the spring pig -- the runt of the litter -- from the ax blade and then deposits him in her uncles barn. Before long those chatty showbiz barnyard voices (Oprah Winfrey and Cedric the Entertainer as Gussy and Golly the feisty goose and gander; John Cleese as Samuel the snob of a sheep; Kathy Bates and Reba McEntire as Bitsy and Betsy the haughty cows; and Robert Redford -- himself -- as Ike the scaredy-cat horse) have coalesced into an organic political community. Its Animal Farm with better jokes. That said I was hardly prepared for the velvet tenderness the slightly doleful maternal perfection of Julia Roberts as Charlotte the friendly spider who comes up with a plan to save Wilbur from being turned into bacon the following spring. She begins to spin words in her web commencing with ""Some Pig"" an almost Zen declaration of Wilburs worth. In a funny way Charlottes Web winks at the power of advertising As that message-board web draws people from all over the county they dont merely marvel at the existence of the words -- they absorb the phrases meaning agreeing that Wilbur who hasnt changed must indeed be some pig. The thing is -- and this is what will leave you a wreck by the end -- he really is some pig. Not because hes at all special but because hes good old ordinary Wilbur perfect and magical in himself as is everyone else. Charlottes Web because of the sweet-souled humor and care with which it has been adapted brings to the screen a vision of the world that in its happy nod to the grace thats in all of us is religious in the deepest sense. Its a movie that might just inspire E.B. White up in literary heaven to wipe away a tear of gratitude.

Revered since its 1952 publication for its inventive narrative about a brainy spiders intervention to save the life of a runty barnyard pig Whites tale holds such a special place in the hearts of many children and parents because of the way it so gently but resonantly introduces youngsters to the natural cycles of life from birth to death. That its literate and droll in the bargain is icing on the cake. The thesps and production values of this second bigscreen version (Hanna-Barbera made an animated musical in 1973) can scarcely be faulted. Surely Dakota Fanning would be anyones first choice to play Fern the plucky girl who convinces her father not to destroy the spring litters odd pig out. And you couldnt really do better than Julia Roberts voicing Charlotte Steve Buscemi as Templeton the selfish rat Oprah Winfrey and Cedric the Entertainer as chatty geese Kathy Bates and Reba McEntire as down-home cows Andre Benjamin and Thomas Haden Church as aggressive crows and lo and behold Robert Redford as a horse and John Cleese as a sheep. But virtually from the outset its clear something is amiss. The dialogue issues forth with no variation of pace. The comedy is never set up by pauses or distractions resulting in very few laughs. The camera always moves in or pulls back to accentuate precisely the emotional point being made and the cuts and music cues inevitably come exactly when you think they will. Nowhere to be found is any dramatic surprise heightening of the pulse or genuine pulling of heartstrings. Gary Winicks direction consists of button pushing and the mechanics are palpable at every step. As spring passes into summer and summer into autumn the leaves change color but the film develops no rhythm of its own no feel for the land or the animals. Even though the majority of the critters are real with mouth movements added they may as well have been computer animated for all the naturalness and life they convey (they also tend to fall over sideways a good deal when startled). Once Charlotte from her web above the barn door promises the little porker Wilbur that shell save him from a smokehouse fate Fanning has little to do making this perf one of the least interesting in her prodigiously precocious career. As the spider continues to spin laudatory words about the pig into her web to the amazement of the locals the general notion develops that Wilbur is indeed ""some pig"" but mostly one reflects upon how much better ""Babe"" did this sort of thing 11 years ago. With verdant rural areas of Victoria Australia standing in for Somerset County Maine pic boasts an appealing timeless quality; cars and clothes are of mid-century vintage and modern technology rears not its head onscreen only in the way the film was made.
