"Spying Spongeing Singing Kingsman The Secret Service Sponge Out of Water and The Last Five Years << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Spying Spongeing Singing Kingsman The Secret Service Sponge Out of Water and The Last Five Years 20th Century FOX Movies February 17 2015 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Sometimes its easy to spot a directors favorite scene. Your pulse may not always go up but its clear his does. The filmmaking changes. It was obvious for instance when David Fincher finally came alive in Gone Girl. The bucket of blood hed been careful not to spill for 100 minutes finally tipped over. The films style loosened up just as the mystery got good and lurid. Kingsman The Secret Service has a moment like that. One of the movies elite English spies -- the one played by Colin Firth -- drops in on a Kentucky church teeming with flamboyantly racist rednecks who turn into killer drones before a melee erupts. Why it has broken out and what Firth is doing at the center is a plot point for someone else to spoil but the orchestrated chaos shoves the filmmaking into a new dimension of violence. The parishioners and Firth attack each other with guns knives an ax a pole and whatever else isnt nailed to the floor. The camera makes promiscuous leaps among attacking bodies the way a virus invades a host. Firth swerves and pirouettes from fighter to fighter wielding something weaponized. Hes got big black glasses and for about two minutes he does such smooth battle that his hair is barely mussed. This is a variation on the joke told every time Firth uses his legs and fists to clean house in this movie King George the Thug-Zombie Slayer. By this point theres already been a long skydiving sequence but the energy in this brawl is akin to being sucked out of a plane at 30000 feet. Maybe its fun but it feels like a hazard too You cant breathe. Im sure director Matthew Vaughn would say he loves all of Kingsman which is based on the Secret Service comic-book series and features a young U.K. street tough named Eggsy (Taron Egerton) training to become a superagent. However that church brawl feels like a sequence that for Vaughn justifies making the rest of the movie. He wants it be a violent rock-and-roll aria. But unlike say any one sequence in a Transporter film either of the Raid extravaganzas the preposterously amazing Old Boy or The Yellow Sea the ""Crazy 88"" climax of Kill Bill Vol. 1 or the Guggenheim ramp shootout in The International Vaughns mayhem moves so fast that its hard to believe. Firth seems insulated from harm by both his cool and the effects. Any sense of triumph is purely at the level of stuntcraft. The rest feels less than the sum of the moving parts. The sequence for one thing is almost ancillary to the story. For another Firth is the only actual character in this video game. If this is an aria it feels lip-synched. Vaughn is a synthetic director. He must know it. The opening lick of Kingsman belongs to Sting singing ""I want my MTV"" from Dire Straitss ""Money for Nothing."" There are jokes about 24 and the Bourne movies and constant allusions to James Bond. The nostalgic shots of boom boxes evoke the more convincingly loose Guardians of the Galaxy and the satire here would be better off in the hands of a director like Edgar Wright who can take a good script and give it strangeness and heart. This film is a lot of zero-calorie flash that makes Guy Ritchie look like John Frankenheimer. Ritchie is insufferably derivative but at least his commitment to masculinity can be sexy. His best capers are hung while Vaughns pants feel stuffed. Vaughn does have a competence that tends to elude a filmmaker like Ritchie. Kingsman is well oiled. Its trapdoor opens smoothly and the vengeful jaunts to Eggsys fraught home life which he shares with his mother and her abusive mobster husband satisfy the itch for life-size justice. These strands manage to meet up loosely in a primary plot in which the Kingsman agency is trying to stop a lisping telecom mogul named Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) from fulfilling his evil-genius plan for a kind of ecological apocalypse via SIM card. Theres a nice (if overlong) finale and I was happy anytime the dancer Sofia Boutella showed up with spiked and bladed feet as Valentines chic henchwoman. After a while though it all starts to repeat itself even Boutellas high-speed fights. Egerton is rough and mildly charismatic. For a lot of the movie he dresses like Samuel Jackson -- caps sweat suits swagger. In the big black glasses he gets from Kingsman he looks like Gary Oldman back when Oldman was one of the most exciting weirdos in the movies. Without them he looks like a DiCaprio or a Wahlberg. Egerton is Welsh. Its surely only a matter of time before Hollywood makes him do so many American accents that he will start to seem as body-snatched as this ironically respectable incarnation of Firth does. Firth has aged into dull stiffness. I miss the version of him that seemed to smell garbage even when he wasnt starring in it. Now everything seems to smell the same. Jackson is the best thing in the movie. He is given couture streetwear and uses that lisp the way some villains use cats. This is something you want from a star for him to relish being in a game or a cartoon. Is it weird that this is yet another movie in which the primary heroes are white guys and the deadliest people are brown or female (or both)? Of course it is. But Jackson can usually get you past -- or least complicate -- a movies casual racism. He could be phoning in his performance but hes having a very good time instead. He slays without ever having to go into a racist church.  Paramount Pictures A steady diet of animated American movies gets you acclimated to a certain kind of regulated rambunctiousness. Sometimes Ill leave a Bolt a Rio or a fiasco like The Nut Job wondering why more of these movies arent crazier. Part of what made people so happy about The Lego Movie is that in its way it got close to out-there. The SpongeBob SquarePants movies go further. The team thats been doing the SpongeBob show on Nickelodeon has been at it for the better part of a decade. Out-there is now pretty much baked into every frame. This is how you wind up with Sandy the cartoon squirrel who uses deep-diving gear to live underseas turning into an actual squirrel in The SpongeBob Movie Sponge Out of Water and pretty much staying that way during the climax. Once again poor bellicose Plankton tries to swipe Mr. Krabss secret Krabby Patty burger recipe. But the recipe vanishes which brings riots and dystopia to the organisms of Bikini Bottom. Mr. Krabs believes Plankton is lying when he says he doesnt have it but SpongeBob knows Plankton is telling the truth and the two enemies are more or less banished together until everyone figures out that the recipe is up on dry land at which point the movies animation style switches from a charming unsophisticated flatness to expensive-looking computer-generated stuff. Sponge Out of Water is a big improvement over the previous soggy 2004 film. It has a nutso druggy quality that makes it feel like its up to more than its plot. Having Antonio Banderas play a live-action pirate named Burger Beard is one thing; having him narrate from an ancient storybook in his exuberant Spanish accent is proof of the movies arbitrary hilarity. Adults make up 40 percent of the shows audience but kids also seem to get the Burger Beard jokes. Whats true of Jackson in Kingsman could quadruple here for Banderas. Ive never seen an actor work this hard this embarrassingly without actually embarrassing himself. The man is an international treasure. Its obvious that the people responsible for Sponge Out of Water feel free. They work with pleasing literalism musicality and an abundant appetite for throwaway lines and puns. (""Unleash the condiments"" says Mr. Krabs while at war with Plankton. ""With relish"" says SpongeBob.) The alacrity is so contagious that even a few of the many fart jokes smell pretty good. I never know what I want from commercial animated entertainment but I do know that I like being able to suspect that -- by the standards of the competition -- its makers might be outlaws and lunatics.  RADiUS/TWC The Last Five Years is a musical drama about Cathy and Jamie a New York couple that meets marries and breaks up after his writing career takes off and her acting career goes in the opposite direction. Its bland earnest and receptive and in order to capture it the director Richard LaGravenese thinks he needs more crane shots than Citizen Kane. But Anna Kendrick and Jeremy Jordan play the couple and as performers they make the movie seem fuller than it is. Jordan is a theater actor and a lot of his singing appears to be on the spot. Hes aggressive eager and spontaneous. Kendrick is more tentative but you sense that its because she has put thought into the part. Her voice isnt big or rich but she controls it and can act out a song. When shes not singing in a movie now youre almost disappointed. The Last Five Years is based on a 2001 stage musical by Jason Robert Brown whose conceit is that Cathy and Jamies songs are duet-less with one exception and time is shuffled. LaGraveneses adaptation puts Cathy and Jamie together a lot so you notice that his numbers are all about how great life is and hers take up the cause of the unhappy and long-suffering. The gimmick doesnt work in the film because the story begins at the end. You know the relationship will never work. But even if it began at the start youd know which way things are headed. Standing side by side or in each others arms they sing every which way but together.

Sponge Out of Water playfully reinforces sitcom-style roles and conflicts through a delightfully absurd scenario that builds in its weirdness until climaxing with a talking space-dolphin/singing seagulls rap battle. So while TV SpongeBobs typical adventures dont involve photo-booth time-machines and Antonio Banderas in a pirate outfit Sponge Out of Water is still business as usual for the irrepressibly cheerful pineapple-dwelling sea-creature.

Photo Paramount Pictures In 2004 I got a dream newspaper assignment from theA New York Times to fly to L.A. and talk to Stephen Hillenburg and his colleagues about turning their Nickelodeon smashA SpongeBob SquarePantsA into a feature film. On TV the SpongeBob cartoons were 11 minutes the perfect length of time to be bombarded by free-form surreal gags inevitably interspersed by the high-pitched chortle of their happy-go-lucky sea-sponge hero. But how would a full-length movie play? Hillenburg was convinced that the same level of intensity over 80-plus minutes would wear the audience out -- that a feature needed a more conventional narrative arc and more even pacing. And you know what? He was wrong.A The SpongeBob SquarePants MovieA had great bits and a terrific soundtrack but it was a tad ... stately. That story structure was like an anchor weighing it down. Missing were those free-associational spasms of craziness that makeA SpongeBobA at its best soA irrationallyA entertaining. Now a decade later comes The SpongeBob Movie Sponge Out of Water which looks as if it cost less. (The soundtrack isnt as rich and there are no celebrity voices.) The opening makes little sense and what follows makes less. If theres a narrative structure I missed it -- the story line is slipshod and shambolic. The few song fragments are punishingly discordant and its visually an eyesore -- a kaleidoscope of bright mismatched colors and in 3-D too to guarantee youll get a headache. Its big loud choppy in-your-face and absolutely positively glorious. Second times the charm. It begins as usual with a hairy pirate whoas there to sing the SpongeBob theme that whisks us to the undersea world of Bikini Bottom with its ukulele music and flower-cloud backdrops ... but wait Heas played by Antonio Banderas (in the flesh) and heas in the middle of an Indiana Jonesalike quest to steal a magic book. After dueling with a reanimated skeleton and shushing some card-playing seagulls the Pirate opens said mysterious tome and begins to read a tale of wholesale destruction societal collapse rampaging mobs and mass starvation. Itas the End of Days in Bikini Bottom. What could usher in the apocalypse? What else? The loss of the secret recipe for the wildly addictive Krabby Patties from the Krusty Krab restaurant where SpongeBob works and his best friend Patrick the fat pink imbecilic starfish eats. I know what youre thinking This has to be the work of Plankton the tiny but very loud and jealous owner of the rival Chum Bucket restaurant. And youd be right but only to a point. Yes Plankton did engineer a scheme involving pickle torpedoes a giant robot and a Trojan-horse-like coin to get into the Krusty Krabs safe but the recipes disappearance has an even more sinister -- and possibly supernatural -- source. No spoilers. Actually I couldnat spoil it if I wanted since Iam not entirely sure what I saw and anyway these jokes donat translate. I can tell you that the lack of Krabby Patties causes disturbing changes in Patrick and also sadly Gary the snail a itas like Shirley Jacksonas The Lottery down there. The only hope rests with SpongeBob (vocals a and chortles a by the great Tom Kenney) and Plankton (vocals by aMr. Lawrencea who sounds like Fred Flintstone on crystal meth) who team up despite Planktonas inability (being so self-centered) to pronounce the word team. Tee-am. Teerrm. At a certain point I lost the narrative thread. Thereas a time machine and then another spatial-temporal dimension and then the whole gang morphs into very ugly 3-D figures and even uglier Marvel-esque superheroes in a battle to the death with the unexpected supervillain. I prefer SpongeBob Patrick Squidward et al. as flat as possible and wasnat happy to see them go all Shrek. But the jokes came as thick and fast as seagull poop which also came so it was okay. Apropos of the bewildering plot twists I was reading a book on how to write (no nasty cracks it was written by an alt goddess) that mentions tricks to get your imagination going like opening a random book to a random page and using random words to create something magical. I wonder if that was the inspiration for the extraterrestrial bottlenose dolphin whose Shakespearean orations are broken by sudden clicks and chatters and whose job is keeping the planets Jupiter and Saturn from colliding. Either that or Hillenburg director Paul Tibbitt and writers Glenn Berger and Jonathan Aibel are experimenting on their own brains. I felt as if they were experimenting on mine too and I was loving it so much I might see The SpongeBob Movie Sponge Out of Water again this weekend. Its lunacy is addictive a itas a Krabby Patty for the mind.

Photo Credit Paramount Pictures Animation advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT When the undersea town of Bikini Bottom runs out of Krabby Patties our squishy hero must save the day. Rated PG. BOTTOM LINE Not the most gripping narrative but the frenetic pace and nonstop gags will please young fans. CAST Antonio Banderas Tom Kenny Clancy Brown LENGTH 132 Someone is always doing something slightly repulsive in ""The SpongeBob Movie Sponge Out of Water"" a feature-length version of Nickelodeons cartoon series. There are jokes about butts poop brain matter and bellybutton crud and thats just within the first 30 minutes. That gross-out humor may explain why ""SpongeBob"" has been such a hit with children since first appearing in 1999 but theres something cynical about these characters and the way they behave. Theyre so grotesquely misshapen and so mercenary when it comes to landing a punchline that its easy to laugh at them but difficult to muster anything like affection. That said fans of the frenetic half-hour show will get a 90-minute version in ""The SpongeBob Movie."" advertisement | advertise on newsday A mix of animation (directed by Paul Tibbitt) and live-action (by Mike Mitchell) ""SpongeBob"" begins in the undersea town of Bikini Bottom where fast-food mogul Mr. Krabs (Clancy Brown) learns that his secret recipe for Krabby Patties has vanished. Deprived of its favorite junk food the population revolts and civilization instantly spirals into a ""Mad Max""-style apocalypse. (Sandy Cheeks the underwater squirrel voiced by Carolyn Lawrence becomes a religious fanatic.) Its up to our invertebrate hero SpongeBob (Tom Kenny) and the cantankerous Plankton (Douglas ""Mr. Lawrence"" Osowski) to find the recipe and bring it home. Their journey will involve time travel a superintelligent dolphin and a pirate named Burger Beard (played with gusto by Antonio Banderas). In other words ""SpongeBob"" is a joke extravaganza not a narrative. What it lacks in emotional resonance -- this aint ""Toy Story"" -- it tries to make up for with non-sequiturs and a lengthy sequence in which our 2-D protagonists become 3-D superheroes. The jokes are hit-and-miss though the dolphin-vs.-seagull rap battle achieves a zany brilliance. Written by Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger (""Kung-Fu Panda 2"") from a story by Tibbitt and series creator Stephen Hillenburg ""The SpongeBob Movie"" might be funnier and more likable if it had something like a heart. The franchise has been functioning just fine though without one. 251 MoviesThe SpongeBob Movie Sponge Out of Water trailer Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

Thats how the Nickelodeon cartoon ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" always starts and after that it just gets weirder. The title animal his starfish friend a capitalist crab an evil plankton -- its the sort of cartoon that you either watched in a dorm room in an altered state or in your pajamas with your four-year-old. For me it was the latter. That child though is taking his SATs this week so I had to go see ""The SpongeBob Movie Sponge Out of Water"" alone. But even childless (and sober) I still had a pretty good time and if you like silliness with a sprinkling of surrealism you will too. The cartoon series is set in Bikini Bottom where SpongeBob is a happy frycook serving up Krabby Patties. Until one day the secret recipe literally disappears -- and since no one ever bothered to memorize it its imperative that SpongeBob finds it. No really imperative. Because within hours of being cut off from their Krabby Patties supply the residents of Bikini Bottom immediately riot turning the place into a Mad Max wasteland. No one wants to see what things are going to be like by Friday. Luckily SpongeBob has the surprising help of the archvillain Plankton. Also a time-machine. Oh and a cosmic dolphin who wears a silver cape and sounds a little like Elton John. You see what I meant about the surrealism? The silliness enters courtesy of some awful/wonderful puns a musical number or two and the character who stole the recipe a pirate named Burger Beard played by Antonio Banderas who converses with seagulls and has a magical book (if not perhaps a spell for getting cast in a serious movie). But no matter. Banderas is a good-natured clown as Burger Beard and the rest of the regular cast returns to voice their characters including the wonderful Tom Kenny as our titular hero and Clancy Brown as the perpetually steamed Mr. Krabs.(Oh and that the brutal guard in ""The Shawshank Redemption"" has gotten his most regular paycheck from playing a crab in a childrens cartoon says more about the bizarre turns of an actors career than I ever could.) The movie takes a slightly shaky turn towards the end when our under-the-sea friends come ashore and become three-dimensional CGI characters. Visually thats slightly jarring but what really seems a shame is when they magically become superheroes; cant we have at least one kids movie that doesnt end with super powers a giant chase scene and a city getting wrecked? But I loved that effete dolphin. And Planktons ill-advised voyage to the bottom of SpongeBobs brain. And the sight of Mr. Krabs in very butch biker gear. And the singing seagulls. And you may too - although taking along a four-year-old at least would definitely help. Ratings note The film contains some mild potty humor. Stephen Whitty may be reached at stephenjwhittygmail.com.

JOHN SEMLEY Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Feb. 06 2015 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Feb. 06 2015 1200AM EST Comments AA Directed by Paul Tibbitt Written by Glenn Berger and Jonathan Aibel Starring Tom Kenny Bill Fagerbakke and Antonio Banderas Classification PG Country USA Language English Whats most admirable about SpongeBob SquarePants - the Nickelodeon TV show the movies the character himself - is how perfectly un-Pixar it is. Theres a long grim history of ""family entertainment"" (read childrens movies) buying pedigree by simultaneously playing to both children and adults. From that fateful shot that left Bambi orphaned to the playthings in Toy Story 3 resigning themselves to their own demise with an air of quiet dignity as theyre trundled towards a blazing incinerator theres a sense that kids movies have to be ballasted by some element of heaviness to be taken seriously. Theres an expectation that a film in tone if not in content alone has to offer ""something for everyone."" With a contrite selfie video going viral Justin Bieber seems to be making amends for his recent poor behaviour. A look at social media may give insights as to whether all is forgiven. CP Video Video Video Will fans forgive Justin Biebers bad-boy behaviour? Not so with SpongeBob. Despite a few nods here and there - such as David Hasselhoff showing up in full Baywatch regalia in 2004s The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie - SpongeBob is unequivocally for kids (or yes stoned adults). Plenty has been made about the vitalizing naivety and unhipness of the SpongeBob franchise which barely needs repeating some 15-plus years in. Suffice it to say that par for the course The SpongeBob Movie Sponge Out of Water mostly nails what has always made the character and his brightly coloured underwater world so endearing the abundant innocence the welcome lack of cynicism and the out-and-out stupidity.Using a framing device involving a pirate-restaurateur named Burger-Beard (Antonio Banderas) telling a story to a group of seagulls Sponge Out of Water plunges us back to Bikini Bottom where our absorbent yellow and porous hero SpongeBob (Tom Kenny) is giddily slaving away as a fry cook employed by the crustacean capitalist caricature Mr. Krabs (Clancy Brown). Yet again conniving microscopic baddie Plankton (Mr. Lawrence) is attempting to swipe the supersecret recipe for the Krabby Patty - an underwater hamburger that Bikini Bottoms denizens crave as if it were a narcotic. When the recipe suddenly vanishes SpongeBob is blamed for colluding with Plankton and the two head for high ground as Krabby Patty-less Bikini Bottom descends (pretty much instantly) into a crumbling hellish Mad Max-modelled postapocalyptic waste.Sponge Out of Waters titular showpiece comes in its final act when SpongeBob Plankton Mr. Krabs grumpy co-worker Squidward (Rodger Bumpass) dopey starfish Patrick (Bill Fagerbakke) and requisite gal pal Sandy the squirrel (Carolyn Lawrence) are magically blasted into ""our world"" - that is the domain of living breathing non-animated humans - in order to recover the Krabby Patty recipe from Burger-Beard. Theres plenty of precedent for this commingling of human and cartoon worlds from Bedknobs and Broomsticks through to Who Framed Roger Rabbit and that Simpsons Halloween special when Homer gets dumped into three whole dimensions and marvels at its wonders (""Oooo ... erotic cakes""). Veteran series director Paul Tibbitt lenses the beaches of bloated sweat-dappled human physiques with a level of cartoonish grotesquerie consistent with the series animation and with the unforgivingly gross beach-body tapestry of Harmony Korines recent Spring Breakers.Ultimately the journey to the realm of landlubbers sinks Sponge Out of Water. Despite a hilarious turn by Banderas who between this and The Expendables 3 has proven himself a major late-career comic talent the CGI sojourn feels too much like a lame attempt to reinvigorate a flagging kiddie franchise. Save for some halfway inventive touches such as a meta-turn that evokes Chuck Joness surrealist Merrie Melodies short Duck Amuck Sponge Out of Water coasts on its 3-D CGI shtick sacrificing the giddy whimsy that recommends the SpongeBob series for more boringly Hollywood whiz-bang action. It may still be blissfully un-Pixar in its levity and absurdity. But it offers something just as unbecoming of a movie carrying the SpongeBob title a burly boneheaded twist on a modern Marvel Comics blockbuster.

By Paramount Pictures Clips on Publish Date February 5 2015. Image courtesy of Internet Video Archive. Watch in Times Video >> embed Explaining the appeal of SpongeBob SquarePants is a fools errand but then thats also a pretty good description of the adventures had by this irrepressible highly absorbent hero. ""The SpongeBob Movie Sponge Out of Water"" is the shows second feature-length installment and while less fluid and fresh than its 2004 predecessor the new film displays enough nutty writing and sheer brio to confirm the stamina of its enduring and skillfully voiced characters.Once again the pipsqueak villain Plankton is scheming to steal the secret formula for Krabby Patties. The twist (along with a slightly tongue-in-cheek lesson in trust and working together) comes when SpongeBob and Plankton are unexpectedly driven to team up after the formula unexpectedly disappears and the underwater world of Bikini Bottom instantly falls into amusingly cliched chaos straight out of a ""Mad Max"" knockoff. Time travel an intergalactic lordling dolphin and a cavorting live-action pirate (Antonio Banderas) also figure in the offhandedly absurd plotting. Photo In ""The SpongeBob Movie Sponge Out of Water"" SpongeBob (right) visits the live-action world all pumped up. Credit Paramount Pictures Puns run rampant but the underwater wonderland remains wondrous for the willful banality of its misshapen populace including SpongeBobs friends like Patrick the Homer Simpsonesque starfish Sandy the squirrel and Gary the snail (who take on new roles in the post-apocalyptic crisis). The well-advertised muscle-ripped renditions of the characters appear only late in the film for a hybrid live-action showdown that feels too much like superhero action with training wheels.The requisite two-tier demographic appeal of animated movies is in effect and the wiseacre writing roused the children at my preview screening less than the SpongeBob theme song.""The SpongeBob Movie Sponge Out of Water"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). For exuberant anarchy and rude humor. A version of this review appears in print on February 6 2015 on page C11 of the New York edition with the headline The SpongeBob Movie.

Were talking about sugared donuts. Yeah thats it Lets just say certain funny creative people have naturally high endorphin levels. And their dream job would be to come up with verbal and sight gags for the hilariously-trippy family film that is The SpongeBob Movie Sponge Out of Water. How ""out there"" do the gags get? At one point the ocean-bottom series regular villain Plankton (voiced by the standup comic Mr. Lawrence) decides to search for the Krabby Patty recipe (the be-all-end-all of burger deliciousness) inside our hero SpongeBobs brain. This is easily done given that Plankton is a plankton. Inside he finds a noisy brain made of candy floss surrounded by insanely-happy imagery and sweets. Plankton is so disgusted by the sight that he becomes nauseous - and vomits rainbows. Kids dont know quite what theyre watching in scenes like this but witnessing things manic and unexpected definitely makes them giddy. At the screening I attended it was hard to tell at times who was laughing harder at Sponge Out of Water the children or their parents. That they werent always laughing at the same things is beside the point. For my part its the most laughs Ive had at a theatre this year. Mobile users please click here. Every kind of humour is at work in this first SpongeBob feature in a decade (kids who saw the first one are presumably in college now). There are Marx-brothers-worthy groaner puns (""Plankton is an enemy"" - ""Make up your mind is he plankton or anemone?"") absurdities (a snail-king orders his painfully-slow-moving minions to ""Seize them"") and plenty of Three Stooges-calibre splat. This free-wheeling anarchical approach does orbit a plot. As often is the case the Krabby Patty formula is in danger - not ultimately from Plankton but from Burger-Beard the Pirate (a hammy Antonio Banderas who has the loneliest job in the world live-acting in an animated movie). Seems Burger-Beard has discovered a secret magic book about the history of Bikini Bottom (SpongeBobs home) and is able to rewrite history putting the formula in his own hands. The theft serves two purposes. First we see a Krabby Patty-starved Bikini Bottom hilariously fall into apocalypse in a matter of days with a wild-eyed Patrick the starfish (Bill Fagerbakke) turning on his best friend SpongeBob (Tom Kenny). Second it gives the whole gang - SpongeBob Patrick Mr. Krabs (Clancy Brown) Sandy the Squirrel (Carolyn Lawrence) and Plankton - a reason to head to the surface and go 3D on us to defeat Burger-Beard and rescue the formula. Along the way theres time travel a magical dolphin time-lord and a left-turn wherein the gang acquires superpowers. Just your typical underwater adventure imagined by only the straightest most sober-sided people locked away in a writers room.

Patrick Star (as Mr. Superawesomeness) left Mr. Krabs (as Sir Pinch-A-Lot) Squidward Tentacles (as Sour Note) and SpongeBob SquarePants (as The Invincibubble) in ""The Spongebox Movie Sponge Out of Water."" (Paramount Pictures) Betsy Sharkey Says L.A. Times betsysharkey on new SpongeBob movie Prepare to giggle All of the strangely charming cartoony undersea nonsense of SpongeBob thats delighted kids and stoners for year comes to the surface in ""The SpongeBob Movie Sponge Out of Water."" Prepare to giggle.Its been a long dry decade since 2004s ""The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie"" though the ongoing TV series is ever-present to keep the flames fanned. This time out the very future of Bikini Bottom SpongeBobs hometown is at stake with the recipe for the residents favorite food Krabby Patties gone missing. Recovering that irreplaceable treasure will require SpongeBob (voiced since the characters 1999 TV inception by Tom Kenny) to square his pants and eventually make his way above sea level buffed up superhero style to save the day. The seemingly impossible mission also spawns an unlikely alliance between the porous-snaggletoothed-yellow-lad and his chief adversary Plankton (Mr. Lawrence) whose devious plan to steal the Krabby recipe set the disaster in motion in the first place. Without Krabby Patties to satiate the insatiable Bikini Bottom appetites the place undergoes an underwater meltdown of apocalyptic proportions. The deep-blue funk of Patrick (the starfish voiced by Bill Fagerbakke) was to be expected but Bikini Bottom burning? Under the sea?To right the wrong requires some serious time-and-space travel with the help of a souped-up photo booth and the mind power of Planktons missus Karen (Jill Talley as the computer W.I.F.E and other voices). But if Plankton is not the nemesis you may be wondering who is? Well that is one of the central conceits of ""Sponge Out of Water"" putting the real world real people and real villains in the mix albeit as reimagined through the SpongeBob prism. Spongebob Paramount Pictures This time out the very future of Bikini Bottom SpongeBobs hometown is at stake with the recipe for the residents favorite food Krabby Patties gone missing. This time out the very future of Bikini Bottom SpongeBobs hometown is at stake with the recipe for the residents favorite food Krabby Patties gone missing. (Paramount Pictures) The movie opens with a taste of that reality a pirate named Burger Beard played by Antonio Banderas turning up on a desert island to retrieve a mysterious book. That book is Burger Beards primary reason to be in the film -- hes there to read about SpongeBobs trials to a flock of insistent sea gulls (and any restless natives watching from their seats).Frankly I think Burger Beards real purpose is to keep rewriting the movies ending -- courtesy of that book a sea gull feather and some squid ink -- anytime the real-life screenwriting team finds itself in a corner. It does help get SpongeBob out of some tight squeezes. Spongebob Paramount Pictures In a computer-generated world where animation generally gets more and more spectacular with each advance SpongeBob Bikini Bottom and the rest look just like they do on TV. In a computer-generated world where animation generally gets more and more spectacular with each advance SpongeBob Bikini Bottom and the rest look just like they do on TV. (Paramount Pictures) The story was ginned up by director Paul Tibbett a ""SpongeBob"" veteran and ""SpongeBob"" creator Stephen Hillenburg; the screenplay is written by the ""Kung Fu Panda"" team of Glenn Berger and Jonathan Aibel. A hold on reality -- the human worlds or SpongeBobs -- is clearly not required. And that idea of Burger Beard adding new chapters goes completely overboard. How else to explain SpongeBob and Planktons trip to the outer reaches of the galaxy or the porpoise also out of water who stands guard in the sky. And then theres the whole superhero segment in which SpongeBob Plankton and the rest of Bikini Bottoms main crew undergo a miraculous transformation from undersea losers to buffed-up action stars suddenly able to exist on land and when necessary serve up burgers and fries to hungry real-life humans. Dont ask.As with all things SpongeBob low-tech rules not always to great effect when it comes to the effects.In a computer-generated world where animation generally gets more and more spectacular with each advance SpongeBob Bikini Bottom and the rest look just like they do on TV. The 3-D bells and whistles promised by the ads is no big deal.The more significant misstep is in trying to mesh the non-animated world of landlubbers with SpongeBobs. To put it bluntly there is no meshing. So when Plankton SpongeBob and friends step onto the beach for the first time instead of a marvel it looks like a bored kid superimposed cartoon characters onto a video of a crowded day at Venice Beach.That mash-up mess -- so bad so un-bold -- might have been enough to sink an ordinary ship. What saves the film is that it is also packed to the gills with the classic slapstick sweetness that makes SpongeBob -- in or out of water on big screen or small -- hard not to laugh at and love at least a little.

"The SpongeBob Movie Sponge out of Water soaks up the fun review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMovies The SpongeBob Movie Sponge out of Water soaks up the fun review Human and animated worlds collide with crazed and colourful The SpongeBob Movie Sponge Out of Water.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. Feb. 5 2015The SpongeBob Movie Sponge Out of WaterStarring Antonio Banderas and the voices of Tom Kenny Clancy Brown Bill Fagerbakke Rodger Bumpass Mr. Lawrence Carolyn Lawrence and Matt Berry. Directed by Paul Tibbitt. 92 minutes. Opening Friday. GOptimistic yellow softie SpongeBob SquarePants returns with a goofy gag-filled surf-and-turf romp that will entertain adults with its ridiculous lunacy as it delights kids with colourful fun.Its trippy and free-form and fans will be pleased to know SpongeBobs wide-eyed optimism remains untainted although you couldnt blame him for becoming a dried-out version of himself with all thats about to go on in his Bikini Bottom home.Article Continued BelowHuman and animated worlds collide when pirate Burger-Beard -- a dastardly hammy Antonio Banderas -- steals a magic book where rewritten pages come true. Hes going to use it to steal Mr. Krabs classified recipe for the Krusty Krabs universally adored Krabby Patties.SpongeBob and friends become landlubbers in their latest movie adventure.Hes not alone. Below the sea bitter proprietor of rival diner the Chum Bucket Plankton (Mr. Lawrence) is working up another one of his elaborate and diabolical plans to nab the recipe for Bikini Bottoms most beloved burger for himself.But Burger-Beard makes off with the recipe first making Planktons larcenous plan an apparent -- and unexpected -- success. Deprived of their burgers Bikini Bottom is instantly plunged into a smoking ruined wasteland.""Welcome to the apocalypse. I hope ya like leather"" growls Mr. Krabs who like the rest of the denizens is suddenly clad like Mad Max extras.""I prefer suede"" sniffs Squidward (Rodger Bumpass) the Krusty Krabs perpetually petulant cashier.SpongeBob the Krusty Krabs devoted fry cook who sees good in everyone even including Plankton is convinced the little green Cyclops is innocent of the theft. The two team up (be prepared for a boatload of gags about teamwork) to restore burger order.Jammed with puns of the ""tanks"" ""youre welcome"" ilk SpongeBob and Plankton frantically delve into a psychedelic outer dimension with the help of a photo booth time machine that includes a chat with a James Mason-sound-alike dolphin who watches over the galaxy in between potty breaks.We also get to see the inner workings of Bobs spongy noggin. Is it really surprising his brainscape looks like a Dali-like version of Candyland?Despite the crazed action which includes all the classic Spongey elements things manage to drag occasionally which isnt surprising when trying to stretch a 10-minute cartoon into a movie. But its ""pretty good actually"" as Bubbles says. Less so with the weak third act where the crew transforms into landlubber superheroes unleashed on the ""real"" world to take on Burger-Beard.SpongeBob dim bulb best bud Patrick (Bill Fagerbakke) Squidward Mr. Krabs and squirrel Sandy (Carolyn Lawrence) hit dry land in altered pumped-up form. In Sandys case that means shes a real although gigantic chittering squirrel. Cute.Paul Tibbitt the Nickelodeon TV series executive producer and writer on the 2004 movie directs from a script penned by Kung Fu Panda 2s Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger. Although much of the audience will be far too young to make comparisons this SpongeBob doesnt hold as much water as the first movie.The kids wont care. Its SpongeBob the Bikini Bottom gang bad puns and his meowing pet snail Gary all bouncing off the screen in 3D like a runaway train full of caffeinated gerbils.All good fun; but enough.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Jen Chaney February 5 2015 Follow chaneyj Its difficult to describe ""The SpongeBob Movie Sponge Out of Water"" without sounding like someone whos been hitting the medical marijuana a little too hard. ""So okay Its a comedy about an animated sponge who teams with his archrival a one-eyed scheming plankton to retrieve the missing secret recipe for a crabcake sandwich thats very popular at an underwater restaurant. For a while it has a real post-apocalyptic vibe. Oh and theres a time machine thats built out of a photo booth a computer a cuckoo clock and some hot dogs. And theres also a talking dolphin. And . . . look it makes more sense during the parts where the narrator Antonio Banderas dressed as a pirate is reading a book."" Anyone whos seen an episode of ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" or the first theatrical release it inspired 2004s ""The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie"" will read that um plot description as semi-standard fare for a SpongeBob adventure. Since the porous giggle-prone cartoon hero made his debut on Nickelodeon in 1999 hes been repeatedly involved in shenanigans that range from just plain silly to straight-up surreal. In the first movie SpongeBob actually rode David Hasselhoff as if he were a human speedboat okay? When this little knee-sock-wearing organism is around things tend to get weird. In ""The SpongeBob Movie Sponge Out of Water"" things get weird too but in a way that lacks the often infectious absurdity of the series and the previous movie. This iteration attempts to cross new animation boundaries while sticking closely to pre-established SpongeBob plot templates resulting in a film thats neither fully fresh nor comfortingly familiar. Instead its stuck in so-so-ville. Once again our absorbent wearer of symmetrically shaped slacks (voice of Tom Kenny) must attempt to restore order at the Krusty Krab where an inability to crank out the fast food joints beloved Krabby Patties has thrust all of Bikini Bottom into ""Mad Max"" levels of chaos. All the usual SpongeBob characters -- dopey Patrick (voice of Bill Fagerbakke) cranky Squidward (Rodger Bumpass) the aforementioned evil Plankton (Mr. Lawrence) etc. -- make appearances and eventually join SpongeBob in his efforts to track down the missing Krabby Patty formula. As in the previous movie those efforts eventually take SpongeBob and Co. out of their standard animated milieu and thrust them into a live-action above-ground setting. That ""Out of Water"" element -- which transforms the characters into CGI claylike beings (the better to see in expensive 3-D my dear) -- has been the primary focus of the trailers and commercials for this film which makes it extra frustrating when we dont get to the ""out of water"" part until a third act that takes far too long to arrive. The movie spends too much time in the mire of Bikini Bottoms post-apocalypse finding only intermittent success at mining that situation and others for comedy. One running gag in which Plankton struggles to properly pronounce the word ""team"" is funny at first but stops being laughable long before screenwriters Glenn Berger and Jonathan Aibel (""Kung Fu Panda"") have abandoned their attempt to sell it to the audience. (Paul Tibbitt the showrunner for the Nickelodeon series who co-directs the movie and Stephen Hillenburg an executive producer of this movie and the creator of ""SpongeBob"" have story credits.) Theres something about this project that despite checking all of the requisite plot and sensibility boxes doesnt convey as an organic work of SpongeBob-ishness. It feels more like something cooked up by Paramount and Nickelodeon to make sure that SpongeBob a multi-billion-dollar cash generator for their parent company Viacom continues to stay relevant both with the kids who watch Nickelodeon and the 20-somethings who view SpongeBob as an object of nostalgia. ""The SpongeBob Movie Sponge Out of Water"" is like the family movie equivalent of a Krabby Patty It tastes fine and will satisfy some cravings. But its ultimately a product cranked out to make money and keep our consumer-driven society much like Bikini Bottoms chugging along without significant disruption. Chaney is a freelance writer. PG.

Before I saw this movie all I knew about SpongeBob SquarePants was that he was a cartoon character who lived in a pineapple under the sea. Because I like pineapples and kid-show kitsch I have occasionally bought Spongebob baubles at thrift stores. I figured when I finally stumbled onto the show itself it would remind me of subversive adult-minded toons like ""The Simpsons.""It turns out I was all wet.""The SpongeBob Movie Sponge Out of Water"" is a 90-minute assault on the senses. And not in an eye-opening way like ""The Lego Movie"" or a Miley Cyrus concert. Its like being strapped into a dentists chair near a TV monitor thats locked on Nickelodeon. With the rhythms and logic of a very average cartoon show it doesnt have hopeful messages for kids or hidden messages for grown-ups. SpongeBob (chirpy voice of Tom Kenny) is so friendly he could sell a hot tub to a lobster. Everyone in his undersea neighborhood of Bikini Bottom is hooked on his fast-food concoction called Krabby Patties. On a day when the whole hood gets the munchies the restaurant runs out of patties. Mr. Sponge-for-Brains cant remember the recipe and before he can retrieve it from the office safe its stolen.The chief suspect is Plankton who runs the unpopular greasy spoon across the path. But SpongeBob who sees the good in everyone thinks Plankton is innocent and together they fight for justice.That entails going up to dry land to find a live-action pirate called Burger Beard (Antonio Banderas incomprehensible on multiple levels). He has been narrating SpongeBobs life story -- and possibly changing its outcome with every stroke of his quill pen. For the last half of the movie the two-dimensional denizens of Bikini Bottom become 3-D CGI superheroes (of sorts) careening around a beach town to find the recipe.Even kids will smell something phony about the repeated cheers of ""Teamwork"" And any grown-up who thinks the obvious puns are somehow clever or subversive has been smoking seaweed. ""The SpongeBob Movie Sponge Out of Water"" squeezes plenty of color and noise from a thin concept then runs with it until non-fanatics cant keep up. If Spongebob SquarePants is really so nice why didnt he include a rest stop at that darn pineapple?What ""The SpongeBob Movie Sponge Out of Water""  Two stars out of four  Rating PG  Run time 137  Content Some mildly rude humor Joe Williams  314-340-8344film criticjoethecritic on Twitterjoewilliamspost-dispatch.com Tags Spongebob Squarepants The Spongebob Movie Sponge Out Of Water Joe Williams Antonio Banderas Animation Joe Williams Joe Williams is the film critic for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

"""The SpongeBob Movie Sponge Out of Water"" review - Chicago Tribune Arts amp; Entertainment Arts amp; Entertainment Review The SpongeBob Movie Sponge Out of Water The SpongeBob Movie Sponge Out of Water Paramount Picture Scene from The SpongeBob Movie Sponge Out of Water. Scene from The SpongeBob Movie Sponge Out of Water. (Paramount Picture) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Haunted by the TV series a critic wrestles with his SpongeBob issues in lieu of a review. Privacy Policy Theres a new ""SpongeBob"" movie out ""The SpongeBob Movie Sponge Out of Water."" Its passable. The trade publication Variety predicts it will be ""equally popular among the franchises key grade-schooler and head-shop-owner demographics"" and that sounds right to me.But Ive always found SpongeBobs world terrifying and while Im probably overreacting well thats in the spirit of the fry-cook protagonist himself. ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" made its Nickelodeon TV debut in 1999 a year before my son was born. Like millions of kids he was into it for a while and now my stepson whos 5 has taken up the torch. The strange thing about the show is how little actual laughter you hear in its vicinity. The tone sensibility and rhythms of life in Bikini Bottom are relentlessly manic-depressive. Try Googling ""SpongeBob"" and ""manic-depression"" sometime and see just how many people out there are somewhat ... haunted I suppose by the show.Kids I think arent so much amused by ""SpongeBob"" as they are gripped by its cheerfully malignant depiction of life as a series of no-win negotiations between employer (Mr. Krabs) and employee (SpongeBob); between pushy suffocating optimist (SpongeBob) and morose insular pessimist (Squidward); between starry-eyed naif (SpongeBob) and the dumbest starfish around (Patrick); and so on. The tyranny of the mob rules the day in Bikini Bottom. Side characters including the failed revenge-minded restaurateur Plankton are pushed to the edge of desperation and violence every minute. Its a typical animated series in that respect and series creator Stephen Hillenburgs undersea world has many champions up to and including President Barack Obama. For me theres a little too much face-ripping too many mutilation jokes and I have found as a parent that no combination of blenders power drills and malfunctioning smoke alarms can compete with SpongeBobs infamous cackle.The series is the generator behind an 8 billion merchandising revenue stream. The latest in that stream ""The SpongeBob Movie Sponge out of Water"" follows the 2004 feature film called ""The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie."" It comes from director Paul Tibbitt a key series staffer over the years and it does the job in its noisy aggravating way. Latest movies reviewedOpen link The plot honors the series key themes. Plankton is still after Mr. Krabs secret formula for Krabby Patties. For a longish stretch ""Sponge Out of Water"" envisions Bikini Bottom as a post-apocalyptic ""Mad Max"" universe which means we get to see some unlikely characters in whips-and-chains gear just in time for ""Fifty Shades of Grey.""Antonio Banderas narrates the story to a flock of talking sea gulls and his pirate character has insidious food-truck ambitions. Not quite in sync with its own marketing campaign ""Sponge Out of Water"" doesnt deliver SpongeBob and the gang to the ""real"" non-animated world until quite late in the film which runs a reasonable-sounding 92 minutes. Yet those 92 feel like more than enough. The real-world excursion is plenty busy but only occasionally clever. (Theres a shot of the tiny characters pedaling a human-sized bike that works very nicely.) Someday I may read the 2011 University of Virginia study published in the journal Pediatrics. It points to the TV show and its probable causation of ""short-term disruptions in mental function and attention span"" among preschool audiences. I experienced similar disruptions watching ""Sponge out of Water"" -- disruptions I generally enjoy with the right movie a funnier one than this.

He may live under the sea but his spirits are forever buoyant. And just as the Nickelodeon cash cow has decorated childrens pajamas and board games and lunch boxes and Mall of America roller coasters since his 1999 TV debut he hopes well still love him on the big screen too. The second SpongeBob film submerges a dozen wee TV-sized skits in ocean-deep seas of feature-length narrative. Yet for all its hit-or-miss moments ""The SpongeBob Movie Sponge Out of Water"" weaves a silly -- and often funny -- spell. Its a scrappy little B-movie that zips along rather entertainingly. It begins in a realm of live action narration from Burger-Beard (Antonio Banderas) a curmudgeonly pirate seeking to rob submerged Bikini Bottom. Thats where SpongeBob (voiced by Tom Kenny) the almost idiotically cheerful sea sponge resembling a kitchen scrubber resists the forces of skepticism and snobbery. He works as a lowly fry cook at the popular Krabby Patty diner but unlike his tentacled coworker Squidward (Rodger Bumpass) he is no ennui-ridden sourpuss but triumphant innocence incarnate. He may be the source of continual sight gags and nutty wordplay but his soul is pure. Mood swings are beyond him. (There may be some logic here Stephen Hillenburg the shows creator taught marine biology for three years before getting a degree in animation.) By contrast Burger-Beard is a sort of bombastic James Bond villain. He wants to steal Krabby Pattys secret food formula for his own ocean-side snack bar. Burger-Beards nefarious plan brings SpongeBob and his underwater friends into realms theyve never explored before. SpongeBob an endlessly cheerful advocate of teamwork pulls several sea-creature friends into his squad. When polite persuasion in 2-D animation fails to halt Burger-Beards larceny SpongeBob and crew don masks and leather moving to 3-D effects of freak-show superheroism. They develop pumpkin-sized biceps and steroid-pumped abs like a 22-minute cartoon being bloated into 93 minutes of film. Feed Loader Left to right Patrick Star and SpongeBob SquarePants in THE SPONGEBOB MOVIE SPONGE OUT OF WATER from Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon Movies. SB2-FF-006 The film staggers around countless subplots a severe episode of ""second-film slump"" in puzzle-like storytelling structure. Of course the kind of jumping from scene to wildly uneven scene that makes adults look at their watches cause kids to snort with laughter. Theyre tickled silly by everything in the film that is fast-paced fabulously forged and cheerfully fake. ""The SpongeBob Movie Sponge Out of Water"" isnt the equivalent of ""The Lego Movie"" which combined brains and laughs in equal measure for every age range. Its the Red Bull of animated kids comedies with a few extra shots of Rockstar Monster and 5 Hour Energy thrown in. It deliberately merrily fuels a hyperactive synthetic buzz. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Talking sponge leaves underwater home finds live-action adventure on land. Director Paul Tibbett (133). PG Mild action crude humor. Area theaters. When we last saw SpongeBob SquarePants on the big screen a decade ago he was thwarting deep-sea disaster with the help of David Hasselhoff. That is admittedly a tough act to follow. But ""The SpongeBob Movie Sponge Out of Water"" is an even more absurd delight -- and not only for its primary fanbase of kids and chemically-altered collegiates. If your social circle includes either of the above youre probably aware that SpongeBob (voiced by Tom Kenny) and his buddies Patrick (Bill Fagerbakke) Squidward (Rodger Bumpass) and Sandy (Carolyn Lawrence) are animated Nickelodeon stars. They live in an underwater Eden called Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob works as a fry cook for Mr. Krabs (Clancy Brown) at The Krusty Krab a burger joint famous for its delicious Krabby Patties. Most of this movie hinges on the disappearance of the Krabby Patty recipe which plunges Bikini Bottom into apocalyptic chaos. Its up to SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs mortal enemy Plankton (Mr. Lawrence) to find that recipe even if it means they have to venture onto solid land to do it. If none of the words in the preceding paragraph make any sense to you fear not. The plot is just a device on which to hang the franchises characteristic blend of witty often surreal humor. Director Paul Tibbett and screenwriters Glenn Berger and Jonathan Aibel open up the action for the big screen adding a cranky pirate (Antonio Banderas) to introduce and occasionally impact the insanity. Left to right Patrick Star and SpongeBob SquarePants in ""The SpongeBob Movie Sponge Out of Water"" ( Paramount Pictures Animation) Theyre clearly having fun with the 3D effects and their bigger budget turning the characters from tiny toons into giant superheroes once they hit land. But the spirit of the series remains true cheerfully random jokes blink-and-youll-miss-them references and above all a silly stubbornly sentimental streak that only the crabbiest cynic could dismiss. You dont need to be a kid -- or even know a kid -- to embrace SpongeBobs brand of open-hearted nautical nonsense.

VPCSpongeBob and friends engage in zany adventures in ""The Spongebob Movie Sponge Out of Water.""(Photo AP)The lovable invertebrate SpongeBob Square Pants hits the big screen again in the buoyant and sometimes frenetic The SpongeBob Movie Sponge Out of Water. But this time he tries a little too hard to make a splash.Its been a decade since the porous guy with the sunny disposition and bright buttery color was last in theaters. This time around hes in 3-D along with his pals from the long-running Nickelodeon cartoon series. His story mixes live action with animation and while the outcome is intermittently funny its also watered-down and hyperactive ( out four rated PG; opens Friday nationwide).The live-action elements -- mostly in the person of Antonio Banderas as cranky pirate Burger Beard who spends most of his time addressing a flock of seagulls -- dont mesh seamlessly with the animated sequences. It almost feels like two movies awkwardly melded together.As usual cheery SpongeBob (Tom Kenny) is awash in puns and happily flipping Krabby Patties at the Krusty Krab eatery. But circumstances inspire him to heroics. Fans will find his goofy good nature intact even as he faces a major predicament.It appears that the secret Krabby Patty recipe has been stolen. And no one not SpongeBob or even the joints owner Mr. Krabs (Clancy Brown) knows exactly whats in those coveted patties. The denizens of SpongeBobs underwater haven Bikini Bottom go from upset to seriously dystopian a la Mad Max one of several movies referenced here.But its all colorful grist for silly humor. SpongeBob tries to help his boss by joining forces with the Krusty Krabs competitor Plankton (Douglas Lawrence). Suddenly everyone in Bikini Bottom even SpongeBobs loyal buddies Patrick the starfish (Bill Fagerbakke) scientist squirrel Sandy (Carolyn Lawrence) and Squidward Tentacles (Rodger Bumpass) believe he and Plankton are responsible for stealing the recipe. The two partner up to prove theyre innocent and find the true culprit. In the process they have to rise out of the ocean. Bathroom jokes are plentiful though thankfully wordplay is the more common style of humor here.The narrator of the tale Banderas Burger Beard turns out to be a key but dastardly part of the story as he fashions a beachfront food truck that looks a bit like a wooden ark and serves up Krabby Patties. Clearly Banderas is having a good time as a wacky pirate but its too bad that what hes given to do is not terribly clever.While SpongeBob remains his sweet self -- a sequence reveals he actually has cotton candy for brains -- the freewheeling frivolity on and around the briny deep drags in the final third. 10 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1DJBaqg",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/02/05/the-spongebob-movie-sponge-out-of-water/22838909/,200,thespongebobmoviespongeoutofwater18,thespongebobmoviespongeoutofwater,usatoday

Comments click to enlarge The SpongeBob Movie Sponge Out of Water 3D Recommended Video Rated PG  92 minutes  2015 This second big-screen outing for the popular Nickelodeon character feels closer in spirit to classic Looney Tunes than to Pixar or Disney features. The infantile hero travels through time and space to find a top-secret crab-sandwich recipe but the story is just a pretext for sustained rapid-fire gags many of them hysterical that range from movie parodies to Gary Larson-worthy flights of cartoon weirdness. The supporting characters include a 10000-year-old talking dolphin that oversees the movement of the planets and in the live-action segments a fast-food-loving pirate named Burger-Beard (Antonio Banderas in what may be his funniest non-Almodovar performance). Even the 3-D effects are fun. Paul Tibbitt directed a script by Glenn Berger and Jonathan Aibel.

SpongeBob and Plankton must work together to restore order to Bikini Bottom when the coveted recipe for Krabby Patties mysteriously disappears. The humor is totally bonkers and unexpected fun.SpongeBob SquarePants comes to CGI life in his second feature film. Most of the ""Sponge Out of Water"" however is in the simple animation that fans have come to love.(Photo Paramount Animation)Story Highlights3.5 stars (out of 5)It has been more than a decade since the first SpongeBob movie hit theaters.The second feature film is a way more entertaining flick than one would expect.The plot is predictable. Its the freewheeling madness of its execution that makes the movie a trip.""SpongeBob SquarePants"" has been raking in the dough for Nickelodeon since 1999. Thats a long shelf life for a childrens cartoon about a burger-flipping sponge with a pet snail but the shows font of random lunacy has yet to run dry.It has been more than a decade since the first SpongeBob movie hit theaters but it turns out theres still plenty of nautical nonsense to fuel ""The SpongeBob Movie Sponge Out of Water."" And the second feature film is a way more entertaining flick than one would expect from a 16-year-old Nickelodeon franchise.This is how silly ""SpongeBob"" is The film opens with Antonio Banderas playing a pirate named Burger Beard fist-fighting a skeleton over a storybook. It only gets sillier from there with Burger Beard reading aloud to his talking seagull friends the adventures of SpongeBob and his pals in Bikini Bottom where the devious Plankton is as usual plotting to steal Mr. Krabs coveted Krabby Patty recipe. Its under tight lock and key at the Krusty Krab where SpongeBob slings the renowned patties for ravenous customers.Still Plankton manages to get his greedy little nubs on the secret formula and as he tussles with SpongeBob over the scroll -- poof It disappears. And just like that a newly Krabby Pattyless Bikini Bottom descends into a post-apocalyptic Mad Max hellscape where all social order is lost. The townfolk mistaking him for a traitor in cahoots with Plankton now want SpongeBobs head sending the pair on a time-traveling quest to save the Krabby Patty recipe.The plot is straightforward predictable and slight no more intricate a plot than a 15-minute TV episode would have. Its the freewheeling madness of its execution that makes the movie such a trip -- as in acid trip.A jaunt into SpongeBobs brain reaches awesome levels of surreality revealing a candy-coated dreamscape populated with giant kittens and unsettling references to ""The Shining."" Its like William S. Burroughs meets Lisa Frank. And it only gets weirder once a talking time-traveling space dolphin who shoots laser beams out of his blowhole is introduced. Puns fly as fleet as Krabby Patties a crab wearing what looks like a leather BDSM outfit leads an angry mob. A trippy Pharrell song that is soon to be stuck in your head forever scores the psychedelic jumps through time. To put it lightly its weird.But giddy lunacy becomes buffoonery once SpongeBob and pals leave the sea in the films third act emerging from the ocean -- and the shows trademark rudimentary animation -- to wreak havoc on humanity in creepy CGI to confront Burger Beard the author of their woes. Its an interminable climax absent the freedom the simpler animation allows.The film is punctuated with several such live-action sequences all of them bad in spite of the obvious joy Banderas projects playing a pirate. And does a movie with sophisticated references to Mad Max and ""The Good the Bad and the Ugly"" really need to stoop to bathroom humor? You know whats funny about seagull droppings? Nothing.As tiresome as those live-action sequences are they are more than outweighed by laughs -- some riotous some groaning and some very very befuddled but none predictable. After 16 years of adventures with a kitchen sponge who lives in a pineapple under the sea thats pretty impressive. The SpongeBob Movie Sponge Out of Water3.5 stars (out of 5)Director Paul Tibbitt.Cast Antonio Banderas Tom Kenny Bill Fagerbakke.Rating PG for mild action and rude humor.Reach the reporter at barbara.vandenburgharizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8371.

Share Tweet SpongeBob SquarePants which first hit Nickelodeon in 1999 has always featured an appealingly goofy main character and his loyal friends an absurdist Tiki background that leaves the viewer completely unaware as to what could happen next and one of the catchiest theme songs around. This winning formula offered a show silly enough for kids and hilarious enough for their parents. So it wasnt too much of a leap for Krusty Krabs best employee to head to the big screen. The last SpongeBob SquarePants movie released over a decade ago found our undersea friend heading off on an adventure that eventually landed him in our own un-animated world for a spell (with David Hasselhoff). More than 10 years later SpongeBobs second movie uses this formula again and improves on it (even sans the Hoff) with help from the producers of the shows earliest seasons. Advances in 3-D animation and CGI as well as the epic journey to end all epic journeys combine to offer the most ambitious Bikini Bottom adventure yet.Last time SpongeBob and Patrick headed out to recover Neptunes Crown. This time the recipe for Krabby Patties is missing which causes the home base of Bikini Bottom to instantly turn into an ""apocalyptic cesspool."" SpongeBob hooks up with an unlikely partner to get the recipe back Plankton his frequent nemesis and the villain of the previous film. But Plankton and Bob both learn a little something about teamwork along the way (even though Plankton cant even say the word though SpongeBob tries ""Say team."" ""Team."" ""Say work."" ""Work."" ""Say teamwork."" ""Timebomb."").The duos journey takes them to realms fantastical even by SpongeBob standards with meta-commentary by an irate pirate named Burger-Beard (Antonio Banderas) who possesses a mysterious book that controls SpongeBobs fate. As SpongeBob and Plankton careen toward different realities time-travel effects appear worthy for once of the concept (and the 3-D is a must). An otherworldly cape-wearing dolphin named Bubbles watcher of the universe in an extremely trippy reality aids the two on their quest pausing only to go to the bathroom. (This is SpongeBob after all.)Just by viewing the trailer one might think that SpongeBob and his friends spend most of the movie navigating a real-life human beach and although that segment is extremely fun it doesnt appear until the end and only briefly. Fortunately there are many entertaining setups before then a battle with Plankton; shots of the Bikini Bottom done up in leather Mad Max-style; even a trip inside SpongeBobs subconscious where life unsurprisingly is a sticky-sweet concoction. Throughout the journey the zany asides keep coming. SpongeBob indicates hes having a breakdown by shockingly mixing garbage and recycling and the movie is not afraid to turn meta on itself as when a wise underwater creature notes ""All right all secondary characters come with me."" Theres no heartfelt overarching message here--even teamwork as much as its mentioned doesnt seem to stick with anyone--but that doesnt detract from the fun.In the end when SpongeBob rewrites his own story to create superhero personas for his friends the transition from the 2-D world to our 3-D one is seamless enough to be stunning. The visual effects and fast and furious quips combine for that rarest of releases one that both parents and kids can enjoy (just like the show) leaving viewers of any age hoping that the next SpongeBob movie isnt an entire decade off.

Photo Paramount Pictures Animation MOVIE REVIEW The SpongeBob movie Sponge Out of Water Running time 92 min. Rated PG (some mildly scary scenes; rude humor) ""Everything I know and love has been destroyed"" wails the formerly irrepressible SpongeBob SquarePants (Tom Kenny) in a sequel Id argue goes a tad dark for the under-10 set When the secret recipe for everyones favorite food Krabby Patties is stolen SpongeBobs undersea hometown of Bikini Bottom descends into a ""Beyond Thunderdome""-style wasteland. But this is why I enlisted a co-reviewer my 8-year-old nephew Lachlan who deems ""The SpongeBob Movie Sponge Out of Water"" a resounding success (""92 percent"" to be exact). Barely registering the ""Mad Max"" motif what he appreciated were the unbridled goofy moments this show does best -- and director Paul Tibbitt making his feature debut has helmed a dozen episodes. Moments like A captive Plankton (Doug Lawrence) being strapped down by Mr. Krabs (Clancy Brown) who dons headphones and tells a knock-knock joke eliciting an ear-splitting giggle from the hyperactive sponge. Or when SpongeBob and Patrick (Bill Fagerbakke) take a spin in a cotton candy machine emerging with glazed eyes and pogo-ing to rave music. Ah the spazzy sugar high -- the very essence of ""SpongeBob."" The crew adventures far from Bikini Bottom in search of the precious recipe.Photo Paramount Pictures Animation Our yellow hero teams up with Plankton to retrieve the recipe nabbed by a beardy pirate (Antonio Banderas). The Bikini Bottom crew even ventures above the surface to complete their mission (""All secondary characters come with me"" sighs a nameless fish leading the townspeople back down into the depths.) ""I liked when they turned into superheroes"" noted Lachlan on the films final act turning into an ""Avengers"" style street fight complete with a Hulk-like Plankton with a disturbingly tiny head. (Dont do steroids kids) Ultimately for the shows fans it may not matter if ""Sponge Out of Water"" shows a hint of mildew. After all my co-critics most enthusiastic note -- ""Hilarious"" -- was written before the lights even dimmed.

TWITTER Antonio Banderas provides the key live-action element in this 3D amphibious feature. You can take the sponge out of Bikini Bottom ... or can you? It would appear even the makers of SpongeBobs first big-screen caper since 2004s buoyantly entertaining The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie realize that the real magic happens below the surface. Read more How DreamWorks Animation Can Claw Its Way Back For although the title and those persistent TV ads might suggest otherwise only a small fraction of The SpongeBob Movie Sponge Out of Water actually takes place above sea level. But rather than further expanding those seemingly limitless SpongeBob horizons the live-action/CG stuff never satisfyingly jibes with the traditional nautical nonsense down below. Despite the resulting watered-down effect it should be clear sailing at the box office for the Paramount release which washes up on American shores Feb. 6 (bumped from last November) following a handful of earlier overseas openings. With almost 200 episodes airing to date Stephen Hillenburgs lovable yellow and porous character has reportedly generated some 8 billion in merchandising revenues for Nickelodeon since first emerging in 1999. Read More SpongeBob SquarePants Real-Life Krusty Krab Restaurant to Open in Palestine (Photos) Armed with a much larger production budget its essentially business as usual down in Bikini Bottom where Plankton (voiced by Mr. Lawrence) is once again plotting to get his hands on the secret Krabby Patty formula. But when it seemingly evaporates into thin air turning Bikini Bottom in an ""apocalyptic cesspool"" in the aftermath he and SpongeBob (Tom Kenny) make for an unorthodox team as they travel through time in a reconfigured photo booth in a bid to restore order. Meanwhile up in the live-action world the crazed Burger Beard (Antonio Banderas) has his own nefarious plans for Mr. Krabs (Clancy Brown) treasured patties. Of course its only a matter of time before the two worlds collide but it takes a lot longer to happen than the marketing materials would indicate. As longtime fans know SpongeBobs previous attempts to come up for air havent gone too well save for a memorable 2D interaction with David Hasselhoff in the last movie. Here longtime series director Paul Tibbitt handles the underwater sequences while Mike Mitchell directs the live-action sequences but the two worlds fail to create a cohesive whole in spite of all the inspired non sequiturs provided by the Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger script. Sometimes life at the bottom can be a good thing.

As far as nautical nonsense goes its hard to top the climax of 2004s ""The SpongeBob Squarepants Movie"" in which the fate of our heroes hinged on the density of David Hasselhoffs leg hair. This years follow-up ""The SpongeBob Movie Sponge Out of Water"" may not quite equal those heights but by doubling down on the Nickelodeon series inherent surreality it proves just as memorable. Alternately inspired exhausting clever stupid (not to mention stupid-clever) and about as meta as any kidpic this side of ""Duck Amuck"" the Paul Tibbitt-directed feature ought to prove equally popular among the franchises key grade-schooler and head-shop-owner demographics. SEE MORE Annecy Film Festival Though the films marketing materials make the most of its characters expansion into three-dimensional CG most of the first two acts take the more familiar form of Stephen Hillenburgs TV toon interspersed with live-action narration from an irritable pirate (Antonio Banderas) relating the tale to a flock of talking seagulls. Down in the undersea hamlet of Bikini Bottom SpongeBob (Tom Kenny) Patrick (Bill Fagerbakke) Squidward (Rodger Bumpass) and Mr. Krabs (Clancy Brown) are busy fending off the latest incursion from failed invertebrate restaurateur Plankton (Mr. Lawrence) to steal the secret Krabby Patty recipe that keeps the venerable Krusty Krab afloat. As usual Planktons schemes are foiled yet in the aftermath the recipe mysteriously vanishes. Deprived of its beloved Krabby Patties Bikini Bottom descends into ""Mad Max""-esque post-apocalyptic chaos within seconds. (""I hope you like leather"" Krabs quips to Squidward in the first of many references -- others involve Stanley Kubrick Douglas Adams and Sergio Leone -- that will fly high over the heads of the youngest audiences.) As the only one who believes Plankton innocent of the recipes disappearance SpongeBob teams up with his onetime adversary to track it down while Bikini Bottom careens further and further into savagery. The story doesnt take long to begin to break down spinning off on several seasons worth of tangents at once offering distinctive takes on subjects ranging from time travel to Aztec human sacrifice the Fisher King myth the efficacy of torture and the proliferation of food trucks. In the films most hallucinatory sequence Plankton takes a journey inside SpongeBobs unconscious; in its most elaborate the gang all emerge onto the surface in full CG where they wreak havoc on a crowded beach and form an ""Avengers""-style superhero squad. (Mike Mitchell is credited as director for the live-action sequences which are amusing enough if a bit prosaic compared with the much richer silliness of the 2D animation.) At 92 minutes this can all become a bit much for the non-addled adult minds in attendance and a few more down moments might have been welcome. But then again a ""dark night of the soul"" sequence would hardly have been appropriate here and credit is due to director Tibbitt for never even feigning a lick of seriousness. At times theres a genuine sense of daring to the films freewheeling anarchy its refusal to stick to a central theme or impart any sort of lesson. On a technical level ""SpongeBob"" has certainly never pretended to be a Studio Ghibli feature but the films palette is as bright and colorful as ever. Pharrell Williams contributes some goofy original songs alongside NERD bandmates Chad Hugo and Shay Haley but none are anywhere near as memorable as the extended rap battle written by YouTube stars Peter Shukoff and Lloyd Ahiquist.

Poze amuzante says March 17 2015 at 1050 am Who lives in a pineapple under the sea? Spongebob Squarepants Absorbent and yellow and porous is he? Spongebob Squarepants His nautical nonsense is something to wish. Spongebob Squarepants Then drop on the deck and flop like a fish. Spongebob Squarepants You know the rest. What person under forty doesnt know the tune to the Nickelodeon hit Spongebob Squarepants? Its grown to such a level in our culture that the little sponge is now up there in the cartoon ranks of Betty Boop Popeye and Fred Flintstone. I remember watching the premiere of the cartoon while I was staying at a friends house. We were watching the Kids Choice Awards in 1999 and this unknown sea creature was next. The reasons I liked this guy was for the same reason I liked him in the beginning; Spongebob himself is a very likable character. Hes overly optimistic he a bit of a goofball but he loves everyone to a core. He makes mistakes but tends to learn from them. Hes obviously struck a cord on everyone else if hes still around today (which of course makes me feel old). That sponge is now making his second cinematic adventure in The Spongebob Movie Sponge Out of Water. On land a pirate named Burger Beard (played by Antonio Banderas) has obtained a magical book that tells the colorful adventures of Spongebob yet can be rewritten at any point to change whatever goes down in Bikini Bottom. Meanwhile Spongebob and his boss Mr. Krabs are once again stopping the evil Plankton from steeling the Krusty Krab krabby patty formula (the McGuffin of the Spongebob universe). As plankton nearly succeeds in making his latest caper the formula suddenly vanishes out of thin air. With no way to make new krabby patties the entire town wants Plankton dead despite his innocence. Spongebob manages to create an escape for he and Plankton making them fugitives. They devise a plan to build a time machine to go back before the formula was stolen. When that doesnt work they are nearly taken as a sacrifice but stop when they notice the smell of the famous fast food coming from above. Knowing that they have to go above the surface Spongebob Patrick the starfish Sandy the squirrel Squidward the squid and Mr. Krabs venture forth onto the beach where they see that Burger Beard was the one who took their formula. Its the sea creatures vs. the pirates for the krabby patty secret formula. It was eleven years ago since we got Spongebob Squarepants The Movie and though its no masterpiece I thought it was a big step for the little sponge and remains a strong animated film from Nickelodeon. The Spongebob Movie Sponge Out of Water pulls out all logic to give us something even goofier. I say this in a good way for fans like myself who expect a lot of the characters oddball personalities and even the shows somewhat abstract animation. The films trailers have advertised the live action sequences even though they take up only the last twenty minutes. The rest of the film is traditionally animated like the show itself. Im not complaining as cinema today is seriously lacking in such beauty and even takes advantage by plussing up the look of Bikini Bottom as The Simpsons Movie did for Springfield. Though the voice actors do a good job with their established characters Antonio Bandaris totally steels the show as the most stereotypical pirate that you would normally see at a childrens birthday party yet is really having fun and is in on the shows goofy atmosphere. My only criticism is that while Spongebob goes through a good character growth in the first movie here everything goes back to normal where it all started. I guess they have to keep it in sync with the cartoon but a lesson learned would have been nice. Ill give this eight krabby patties out of ten. Youll know if you like this movie by watching Spongebob on TV first. If you dont like the show your not going to be swayed by this movie but I expect this to be a pleaser for dedicated fans. Reply La says February 23 2015 at 1254 pm So this is what happens when you legalize marijuana? I have never watched Sponge Bob but bits and pieces. Talk about upside down morality. This movie is not for kids and if the cartoon is like this it is not for kids. Heres my take. Here are the lessons it teaches our kids 1. Good guys can be greedy. 2. Attempts at robbery go unpunished. 3. If you cant get what you want its okay to riot loot and burn things down. 4. Teamwork is only an endeavor for success. If a teammate fails in decision making its on him and you should bail from a failing team. 5. Any adult has to be high as a kite to enjoy it as it is all over the place with the story line as if written by someone with ADHD. Not to worry thought the psychedelics with a good high will make it worth the money. All I can say for the creators of Sponge Bob is my child will no longer be watching it and if this is your attempt to copy a Smurfs type cartoon get rid of the ADHD and clean up the story line and morals. Yes Smurfs had the mushroom high thing going on but at least their story lines were clean and easy to follow not all over the place and taught good morals. Reply Marcos lopes says February 23 2015 at 915 am Two words ""rip off"". My 8 year old kept asking me when the real movie was going to start. It is basically a TV episode with 5 minutes of 3d animation. the TV trailer is very misleading. Reply Dad says February 9 2015 at 914 pm This may sound odd but the things parents do. My daughter is a big SB fan but she has fears of watching movies. Shes afraid it will contain potty humor specifically urination. You might be surprised how many movies use this gag for cheap laughs. It really bothers her when she sees it. Shell worry the entire movie unless I can assure her there is no potty humor. Ive wrong before and I would like to be certain before I convince her to see the SB movie. So for those of you who seen the movie is there anything for her to fear? Reply juanaalmonte says February 9 2015 at 410 pm I watched this and I love it Reply juanaalmonte says February 9 2015 at 405 pm I would want to this everyday Reply Jason says February 2 2015 at 145 am I went to the screening for this movie and fell asleep through half the movie. There was little to no laughter in the theater in which half the filled audience was children. In comparison the Big Hero 6 screening I had went to months back was filled with laughter of all ages throughout the movie. Nickelodeon needs some better writing and wittier comedy. There is so much silliness and randomness even a child can take. It seems as if the writers didnt even try and relied on the popularity of the characters to please the audience. This is coming from a Spongebob fan of over 10 years Reply njwhitey says February 3 2015 at 1030 pm I have just come from a screening at Paramount the kids were all laughing thoughout and the adults were joining in at points. The whole Dolphin sequence was ridiculous. Not sure what was wrong with you miserable lot this film was great. Reply Zach says February 4 2015 at 446 am You did nothing of the sort. You probably work at Paramount trying to make this miserable excuse of an exploited property look good. CarlNigassi says February 3 2015 at 630 pm This movie sucks. I think thats what he was trying to say. Reply Jason says February 3 2015 at 415 pm I suck because I speak my opinion on this movie? It seems like youd be a great writer for Nickelodeon reading your witty and comedic criticism. Work on your grammar and you may be something in life. Every word capitalized? Come on man you learn that in elementary school Reply Joan Stevenson says February 1 2015 at 320 pm In case the author of this piece can see this Im asking are you sure that Matt Berry is in this movie because there are no notices of it on IMDB for the movie or his IMDB profile Reply njwhitey says February 5 2015 at 330 pm Hes the voice of the Dolphin Best bit of the movie Reply Vincent Waller says February 2 2015 at 410 pm He is most assuredly in the movie. I promise promise promise. Reply rjbailey says February 1 2015 at 354 am Reblogged this on Locating Frankensteins Brain. Reply Al Patrickson says January 31 2015 at 453 pm Glad they gave this movie a good review unlike Hollywood Reporter. This movie is gonna top the box office next week with 34.5M. Reply CarlNigassi says February 3 2015 at 636 pm No way. This film will NOT top the box office. The 1st movie didnt and thats when SpongeBob was at the height of its popularity. The show hasnt been relevant since 2009 so no it wont do very well. Reply Greg says January 31 2015 at 739 pm It better or Nicks going to pull the plug on this series. Remember what happened with Rugrats Go WIld? Reply CarlNigassi says February 3 2015 at 640 pm No SpongeBobs days are numbered. The show wont make it to 2019 and Nickelodeon will start exploiting Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. wjm980 says February 1 2015 at 1240 am Spare me. SpongeBob will be on Nick long after youve shuffled off this mortal coil. 1rajesh says January 31 2015 at 450 pm Hey cant wait to see this movie Reply CarlNigassi says February 3 2015 at 641 pm Youd be one of the few people who actually want to. Reply Lremy says February 12 2015 at 156 pm My daughter and I left before the movie ended. It was like Sponge Bob on Drugs No real flow of a storyline. We have such a headache from the busyness and oddity of the film. Wish it was better CarlNigassi says February 3 2015 at 632 pm The last thing the world needed was anything SpongeBob SquarePants related. This movie is going to suck and I hope it fails.

Having already successfully nailed this tricky transition with ""The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie"" in 2004 the denizens of Bikini Bottom once again make their way into multiplexes everywhere with a non-stop barrage of sight gags and wordplay that never outstays its welcome. Theres just enough plot and just enough characterization in ""The SpongeBob Movie Sponge Out of Water"" to keep things moving along and the jokes are consistently hilarious with enough variety to tickle the funny bones of old salts and young fishies alike. See Video SpongeBob SquarePants Experiences 3D for First Time in Sponge Out of Water Movie Trailer (Video) A game live-action Antonio Banderas kicks off the film as pirate Burger Beard who follows his treasure map to secure a legendary book. (In a gag that will probably sail over most childrens heads theres an old-school library check-out card on the inside front cover showing Captain Kidd and Bluebeard as its earlier readers.) That book contains the story of SpongeBob SquarePants (voiced by Tom Kenny) and fills non-viewers of the TV show in on the basic storyline and cast of characters. The embittered Plankton (Mr. Lawrence) launches attack after attack on the Krusty Krab the restaurant where SpongeBob works frying up Krabby Patties the favorite snack of everyone in the undersea town of Bikini Bottom. Stingy Mr. Krabs (Clancy Brown) steadfastly guards the secret recipe but it somehow disappears as SpongeBob foils one of Planktons attempts to steal it. Without Krabby Patties all of Bikini Bottom descends into ""Mad Max""-ian post-apocalyptic frenzy (within seconds everyone is wearing leather harnesses and face masks) and its up to nemeses SpongeBob and Plankton to team up to find the formula and save their friends. The screenplay by Glenn Berger and Jonathan Aibel (""Kung Fu Panda"") from a story by ""SpongeBob"" vets Stephen Hillenburg and Paul Tibbitt takes this unlikely team to wild and wonderful places thanks mostly to a makeshift time machine. (The trippy time-travel sequences alone merit seeing the movie in 3D.) Also Read Paramount Avoids Fifty Shades by Moving Up Spongebob Squarepants Sequel As the trailers promise SpongeBob Plankton Mr. Krabs Squidward (Rodger Bumpass) starfish Patrick (Bill Fagerbakke) and squirrel Sandy (Carolyn Lawrence) wind up crossing over into the surface world to battle Burger Beard directly but this skirmish doesnt take place until well into the third act no doubt welcome news to those who worried the movies hybrid of live-action and animation was merely a gimmick. The ""Sponge Out of Water"" sequences in which the characters graduate from two to three dimensions never feel visually jarring; our heroes maintain their sense of cartooniness even as they turn into CG creations thus making their later transition into superheroic versions of themselves a delightful sight gag. When Sandy becomes an actual squirrel its disorienting for her pals but a great bit for the audience. Also Read Melanie Griffith Antonio Banderas Announce Divorce Most of the voice cast are veterans of the show and have had a good 15 years or so to get the characters just right; this ensemble makes a strong case that you dont have to cast celebrity names to find the best voice talent. As for Banderas he so thoroughly throws himself into the silliness that he could have a real future in childrens media; if PBS ever brings back the bilingual ""Villa Alegre"" I nominate him for alcalde. You certainly dont have to be a fan of the show to find yourself enchanted by the goofball humor. Only the most pun-phobic viewers will be able to resist a food fight wherein Mr. Krabs commands ""Unleash the condiments"" to which SpongeBob replies ""With relish"" Breaking News To Your Inbox.
