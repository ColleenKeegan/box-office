By Peter Rainer December 7 2007 Save for later Saved Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 ""The Golden Compass"" is a blatant attempt to duplicate the success of the ""Harry Potter"" franchise. The only thing missing is richly imagined characters a comprehensible story line good acting and satisfying special effects.Not having done much more than dip into Philip Pullmans megabestselling ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy which has been accused of anti-Catholic bias I cant judge the faithfulness of the movie adaptation except to say that any alleged antireligiousness has been watered down to near nonexistence.Based on the first book in the trilogy Chris Weitzs ""The Golden Compass"" recounts the adventures of 12-year-old Lyra Belacqua (Dakota Blue Richards) a ward of Jordan College in Oxford who journeys into a parallel universe ruled by armor-plated polar bears and ""daemons"" - shapeshifty physical manifestations of the souls of human individuals. Lyra has her very own daemon - who looked a bit like Alvin the Chipmunk to me - and so does Nicole Kidmans icy Mrs. Coulter the Magisterium head of the General Oblation Board (dont ask). Her golden-monkey daemon like herself is up to no good. A bearded Daniel Craig also turns up as Lyras uncle Lord Asriel (anagram for Israel) and his daemon is a snow leopard. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? The compass of the title is a device in Lyras possession that tells the absolute truth and the truth here is that this movie which is rather optimistically set up for a sequel could have used a better daemon of its own.

"Golden Compass Wrong directions | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesGolden Compass Wrong directions With its rushed jargon-pumped exposition surplus of quarter-baked characters stray narrative strands and generously dropped hints of things possibly to come The Golden Compass is a movie that wears its franchise ambitions on its sleeve.Dakota Blue Richards left stars as Lyra and Ben Walker is Roger in Chris Weitzs very dull fantasy-lit holiday flick The Golden Compass. By Geoff PevereEntertainment ColumnistFri. Dec. 7 2007 (out of 4) Starring Nicole Kidman Dakota Blue Richards Daniel Craig Sam Elliott Eva Green Derek Jacobi Christopher Lee. Written and directed by Chris Weitz. At major theatres. 113 minutes. 14A  Article Continued BelowWith its rushed jargon-pumped exposition surplus of quarter-baked characters stray narrative strands and generously dropped hints of things possibly to come The Golden Compass is a movie that wears its franchise ambitions on its sleeve.Clearly an attempt to create a new fantasy lit-based series in the Anglo-fanciful tradition of The Lord of the Rings Harry Potter and The Chronicles of Narnia series The Golden Compass adapts only the first of Philip Pullmans His Dark Materials trilogy.Let me fess up. If this viewer finds himself wishing success to this new entertainment venture it is not because I found myself seduced by the narrative pull of this almost-incomprehensibly over-detailed CGI-heavy story about a 12-year-old girl named Lyra (played by the curiously named Dakota Blue Richards) who lives in an alternate world where peoples souls take the form of computer-generated talking animals known as ""daemons.""(Children as befits their unsettled nature have daemons that morph while adults as befits their duller nature are accompanied by critters that do not.)No it was because of the alcoholic bear. More than anything I hope there are more instalments of this series because I want to know more about the big cranky bear with the drinking problem. And who wouldnt?Most people apparently as it has come to my attention that my hopes are in vain. There will be no salty accounts of the bear (an armoured warrior bear voiced by Ian McKellen and named Iorek Byrnison) in his active imbibing phase and there will be no inspirational passages devoted to his struggles with recovery.No by all accounts provided me by people familiar with Pullmans books the segments of The Golden Compass and its possible offspring devoted to the drinking life of the bear are over.Which leaves us with what weve got which is a movie far more likely to move cross-promoted merchandise and DVDs than it is viewers of the not-already initiated variety.For those of us for whom the movie (written and directed with journeyman impersonality by American Pies Chris Weitz) marks the first point of contact with Pullmans daemon-studded universe The Golden Compass will most likely point only to the parking lot.Not that the movie doesnt have all the requisite embellishments weve come to expect from such fantasy-lit holiday-season rituals which is to say a sterling cast of English-accented actors (like Nicole Kidman Daniel Craig and Derek Jacobi) and voices (McKellen and - as an equally aggressive bear - Ian McShane).There is a surplus of dialogue rooted in arcane knowledge and a riot of talking animals flitting about their human hosts.The alt-world sets are immaculately realized in a completely synthetic sort of way and the central conflict involving a perkily determined young girl (on a mission to rescue a chum imprisoned somewhere in a frozen north by the sinister ""Magisterium"") cant be anything but good news for parents concerned about equitable and balanced representations of magically inclined children.But boy is this sucker dull. Indeed even the element of the novel most likely to make a movie adaptation interesting - the allegedly ""anti-religious"" subtext of Pullmans narrative - has been as efficiently nullified and purged as the ugly details of an ill-tempered talking bears bout with the demon whisky.Good for the bear if somewhat less so for the rest of us.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Movie review ""The Golden Compass"" with Dakota Blue Richards Nicole Kidman Sam Elliott Eva Green Daniel Craig. Written and directed by Chris Weitz based on the novel by Philip Pullman. 114 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sequences of fantasy violence. Showtimes. The film version of Philip Pullmans novel ""The Golden Compass"" the first in the authors ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy has been many years in the making; a recent New York Times story detailed its several changes of screenwriter and director and the vast sums spent (a reported 180 million) to bring it to the screen. Now finally completed under the imprint of writer/director Chris Weitz (""About a Boy"") the result feels a bit anticlimactic. Its a big handsome movie with impeccable special effects and some truly impressive armored bears but it has a by-the-numbers feel to it. The anti-organized-religion theology of the books (Pullman has described his trilogy as the moral opposite of C.S. Lewis Narnia series) has been carefully removed; what remains is a moderately engaging adventure. Weitz has culled most of the books major events (though he ends the movie long before the book ends leaving out Part III) and meticulously organized the complex story into an under-two-hour script. It gallops along gamely like those noble bears but never finds wings on its feet. At its center is 12-year-old Lyra Belacqua (newcomer Dakota Blue Richards) a bright child with a determined chin and a flinty voice. She lives on a British college campus in a faintly recognizable world very different from our own in which peoples souls walk with them as visible spirits in the shape of animals (called daemons) and in which children keep disappearing. Lyra in the manner of all heroic children of literature is called upon to venture into the frozen Northlands to find them -- discovering a horrific conspiracy against which she and other good souls must battle. All of the performances are effective Nicole Kidman is icily charming as the sinister beautiful Mrs. Coulter who takes a mysterious interest in Lyra (she had notes the tomboyish Lyra in the book ""the smell of glamour""); Sam Elliott brings his meat-and-potatoes bluster to the role of Texan aeronaut Lee Scoresby; and Daniel Craig makes his few moments on screen slyly tantalizing as Lyras enigmatic uncle the scientist Lord Asriel. But its young Richards who must carry the film and shes asked to do so with a script that gives her only one note resoluteness. She gives a performance thats poised beyond her years but Weitzs workmanlike script doesnt find anything magical for her. Iorek Byrnison the bear king who joins forces with Lyra is wonderfully rendered and the scenes in which Lyra rides her galloping friend through vast fields of snow come as close as ""The Golden Compass"" gets to cinematic excitement. But despite some truly unnerving developments (a scene involving the electrocution of a child is genuinely upsetting) Weitzs movie remains ultimately remote. It ends mid-adventure so blatantly setting the stage for a sequel that the whole thing suddenly feels like a preamble. Those who havent read the book may wonder what all the fuss is about; those who have may wish to return to it to find the thrill in storytelling that this movie never quite captures.

Starring Dakota Blue Richards Daniel Craig and Nicole Kidman. Directed by Chris Weitz. (PG-13. 113 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Likable and eye-catching ""The Golden Compass"" presents an impressively realized fantasy world. Not only can polar bears talk but they also sound like Ian McKellen and people wear their souls on the outside of their bodies in the form of animals - or ""daemons"" - that follow them everywhere. Theres no doubting any technical aspect of the film and the virtues on display arent limited to the technical. The cast is made up of major actors perfectly suited to their roles and one flat-out no-doubt-about-it find in the form of Dakota Blue Richards who plays Lyra the young heroine. Yet despite all this an aura of disappointment takes hold midway into ""Golden Compass"" and becomes undeniable by the finish. Some will see the movie as a near miss and others as a close hit but few will be able to convince themselves that ""The Golden Compass"" is an achievement on the order of the ""Lord of the Rings"" films or ""The Chronicles of Narnia."" Those movies realized the serious undertone of their literary sources. This one retreats from its source. ""The Golden Compass"" is based on the first book of Philip Pullmans ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy which posits a sort of alternative version of history in which the Protestant Reformation never happened. In Pullmans tale the church known as the Magisterium is clearly a version of the Roman Catholic Church which instead of being purged of corruption and stripped of worldly power rules nations disciplines truth seekers and keeps scientific knowledge under strict control. The film adaptation retains the Magisterium and its officers do look something like Catholic cardinals but the books ideas about the dangers of organized religion have been either dumbed down or obscured. The brain has been removed from the story - or worse. In ""The Golden Compass"" theres a ghastly process called intercision in which children are separated from their daemons. This film is like Pullmans tale separated from its daemon. Its a story without a soul. When Peter Jackson directed ""Lord of the Rings"" there was the sense of a director who saw that world whole who had a complete vision in his mind of how Middle Earth looked and felt and what it meant. But in ""The Golden Compass"" director Chris Weitz (""About a Boy"") is just feeling his way piecing together the work of a brilliant technical staff with his own sense of how characters should interact. His adaptation of Pullmans novel feels like talented guesswork an experiment in how much could be cut away without killing the patient. Lacking an overarching understanding Weitz could only assemble the elements and hope for an infusion of magic but the magic isnt there. But Dakota Blue Richards is there and thats something. A 13-year-old girl with no previous screen experience Richards has slightly messed-up English teeth wide-set eyes and the alert knowing face of a smart 32-year-old woman. Lyra is a student in an Oxford boarding school and as played by Richards its no stretch to believe that this girl is special enough for the fate that destiny has set aside for her - to be at the center of the battle between knowledge and ignorance free will and oppression. Daniel Craig plays Lyras uncle Lord Asriel a famous explorer scientist and politician who is making discoveries that will shake the authority of the Magisterium. As Asriel Craig is commanding and swaggering but his role is given short shrift. Nicole Kidman fares better as Mrs. Coulter a rich refined woman who lives in airy splendor and takes on Lyra as a protegee. As embodied by Kidman Mrs. Coulter is tall and composed and as cold and scary as a movie star. The films title comes from an object entrusted to Lyra known as an alethiometer something almost as important as Frodos ring a truth-telling device that only she can read. Though the story is complicated Lyras goals are simple throughout - to reunite with her uncle to protect the compass and to help find some classmates of hers who have gone missing. Along the way she meets a band of scruffy renegades known as Gyptians and has run-ins with government thugs known as Gobblers. She also teams up with Iorek (McKellen) a tough-as-nails polar bear who is the movies best CGI achievement. Yet the longer the film goes on the less it builds. Sam Elliott shows up as a wily Texan who wants to help Lyra and the characterization is tired. An obligatory battle scene takes place with Alexandre Desplats John Williams-like music pumped over the soundtrack but the music sounds surer than the action. The lack of energy is palpable probably stemming from a lack of directorial purpose and conviction. When the ending comes its a surprise. I saw the movie before reading the book - without knowing that the script lopped off the last 100 pages of the novel - and it still seemed truncated to me. In the end theres only one way not to be disappointed by ""The Golden Compass"" and thats to approach it as a childrens version of an adults book.

Friday December 7 2007 225 AM The Golden Compass. Fantasy adventure following a 12-year-old girl into the frozen north to rescue kidnapped children. With Dakota Blue Richards Nicole Kidman Daniel Craig. Director Chris Weitz. (154) PG-13 Fantasy violence. Area theaters.Without question Chris Weitzs ""The Golden Compass"" a 200-million-plus adaptation of the first novel in Philip Pullmans ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy represents the years biggest gamble - and it delivers the years biggest and most ambitious fantasy.Best described as an allegory about the tension between the attractions of free will and subordination in human experience Pullmans trilogy has drawn the ire of religious groups who see it as a primer for youthful rebellion against the moral authority of the church. The film doesnt make this conflict explicit but it too is drawing calls for boycotts. The initial salvo in the epic tale follows free-spirited 12-year-old Lyra Belacqua (newcomer Dakota Blue Richards) into the frozen north of a parallel Jules Verne-style universe to rescue children kidnapped from England. Along the way she encounters seafaring rebels known as Gyptians a race of warmongering polar bears a good witch a cowboy pilot and an army of strange-speaking mercenaries. At her side the entire way is her daemon Pan (voice of Freddie Highmore) a shift-changing creature who is her external soul. All humans are born with them and as they grow up their daemons evolve into an animal that reflects its humans moral character. The daemon of Lyras courageous Uncle Asriel (Daniel Craig) for instance is a snow leopard. For the devious Mrs. Coulter (Nicole Kidman at her most arch) it is a nasty little golden monkey. Next to others we see dogs wolves rats cats ferrets horses eagles and snakes - all of them computer-animated and blended seamlessly into the live action. I loved them all but just wait until you see the bears. While the battle scenes dont reach the level of spectacle of ""The Lord of the Rings"" movies they are fabulous to watch. When people die in battle their daemons vaporize in a hail of golden sparks. The title refers to a truth-telling device given to Lyra by an elder who believes she is the girl in the Prophecy of the Witches the one born to find the truth and set the human will free. That doesnt happen in this episode which ends satisfactorily while setting up the next. Fans will wait with bated breath. If ""The Golden Compass"" doesnt score big at the box office the movie series is over. jmathewsnydailynews.com Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Dakota Blue Richards stars as Lyra in the adventure The Golden Compass. Photo Laurie Sparham New Line Cinema The Golden Compass 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Ian McKellen always had it in him a polar bear snarling to get out. We always knew that given the chance he would rear on his hind legs flash his teeth unleash a hideous roar and bear-slap his rival in paw-to-paw combat. He does just that in The Golden Compass -- with help from friendly digital animators who had their work cut out for them adapting the first of Philip Pullmans popular and controversial novels. In this dark fantasy other-verse the Arctic is ruled by a warrior race of ""ice bears"" the seas are sailed by nomads and the sky is filled with witches and H.G. Wellsian airships piloted (for instance) by Sam Elliott in a cowboy hat. Souls reside not within human beings but without walking and talking in animal form. Theyre called daemons but they arent evil spirits. Not by definition although a nasty person might have a rather mean-spirited beast strolling beside her. The villainous Mrs. Coulter -- an icy and so-fab Nicole Kidman encased in clingy dresses -- enjoys the company of a fiendish monkey described as golden-furred in the book but here downgraded to a Breck-girl copper. The object of their antipathy and the heroine of this tale is little Lyra Belacqua played with you-go-girl sang-froid by an amazing find named Dakota Blue Richards. Her withering gaze framed by perfect strawberry ringlets is a special effect all by itself. Shes also accompanied by a shape-changing cat/ferret/bird daemon. Lyra conforms to the accepted fantasy conventions Shes an orphan shes rebellious shes blessed with special powers and shes prophesied as the one child who could save us all. On her quest she uses a mystical sword I mean light sabre I mean ring I mean ""alethiometer"" -- the golden compass of the title a shiny needled instrument that directs its user to the truth. Writer-director Chris Weitz is best known for About a Boy which was actually about a man who refused to grow up until an extraordinary child saved him. In The Golden Compass the baddies are snatching kids and trying to fix them in a state of innocence. McKellens Lord of the Rings castmate Christopher Lee portrays the evil First High Councilor in the Magisterium the ruling body of theocrats who double in Pullmans world for the purpliest stereotype of Roman Catholic hierarchy. The word ""church"" has been expunged from Weitzs screenplay leaving behind men with pursed lips in weird clerical frocks. But theres no mistaking those old opposing forces of the Enlightenment dogma on one side reason on the other. Representing dogma besides Lee are yet more wicked British thespians specifically Simon McBurney and Derek Jacobi. On the side of reason we find Daniel Craig as Lyras upstanding scientist-uncle Lord Asriel who has been investigating the presence of cosmic metaphysical dust at the North Pole. He plans to travel by these sparkly particles to other universes. He is shall we say pro-dust. The Magisterium is anti-dust. The Magisterium would like to quash all dust-related inquiry though no one explains why. The film zips through the whole dust issue just as it zips through everything else; Weitzs film is short punchy and efficient and its full of engaging spectacle but it feels like the nickel tour through a parallel dimension. Jargon and backstories whiz past with scant time to absorb it all and the film ends a few chapters early. Perhaps theyre being saved for the sequel. Just so long as Richards is back -- and McKellen is with her snarling. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Clearance Patio Furniture and Decor at Lowes Up to 50% off NFL Caps at Lids for 10 + free shipping w/ 50 Lighting amp; Ceiling Fans at Home Depot Up to 80% off + free...

Thats high praise and only part of the story. This screen version directed by Joe Wright and adapted by Christopher Hampton from Ian McEwans novel of the same name stands on its own as a singular achievement -- romantic sensuous intelligent and finally shattering in its sweep and thematic complexity. ENLARGE Keira Knightley (left) and Saoirse Ronan play sisters in the new film version of Atonement. One of its themes is the nature of storytelling What are we being told whos telling it whats the motive and is it the truth? ""Atonement"" starts in 1935 spans six decades and tells of a single moment of mistaken perception that changes the course of three lives. The moment is an odd but innocent encounter between the lovely privileged Cecilia Tallis and Robbie Turner the talented son of a servant. Yet the child who observes it Cecilias precocious 13-year-old sister Briony (Saoirse Ronan) jumps to a conclusion that isnt just wrong but perverse; she lacks any understanding of adult behavior that might put what she thinks shes seen in sensible context. And Brionys inflamed imagination leads her to a fateful decision for which she lacks any clear motive. In the book these abstract considerations play out slowly and narrative voices change imperceptibly. Movies are by nature more literal and often need to move quickly to hold our attention. The pace of Mr. Wrights filmmaking can be brisk. (Hes the English director whose debut feature was the fine 2005 version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" with Ms. Knightley as Lizzie Bennet.) But Mr. Wright is also good at conveying leisure -- even the torpor of a hot summer between the wars -- with telling details the slow click of Brionys typewriter a bee buzzing at a windowpane the premonitory silhouette of a bomber seen through a skylight. ENLARGE And though the camera beautifies much of what it observes the cinematographer Seamus McGarvey together with the director and the production designer Sarah Greenwood have heightened the ugliness of World War II with among other sequences a single astonishing Steadicam shot lasting more than five minutes that follows Robbie as a soldier through the chaos of the British evacuation on the beach at Dunkirk. A movie that runs slightly less than two hours cant begin to match the density or the cumulative power of a novel that one critic called ""a mighty edifice."" Yet the uniformly excellent cast and indeed the casting of even the smallest roles lends clarity and urgency to Mr. McEwans characters. Ms. Knightleys Cecilia is not merely beautiful though thats hardly a bad thing; shes quick-tongued and beautifully pensive. Mr. McAvoys Robbie combines working-class buoyancy with understated intellectuality. At first Robbie and Cecilia look touchingly like silent film stars immune to future tragedy. By contrast the young Brionys gaunt unfinished face mirrors her unfinished unmoored mind while Briony as a young woman played by Romola Garai seems to be trapped by unmanageable guilt in a life of suspended animation. In the last part of her life Briony is played by Vanessa Redgrave a startling apparition in a role thats relatively small but indispensable. Much is asked of both the character and the actress for the last part is when startling truths are revealed in rapid succession and neither disappoints. Briony inspires horror but also awe as a haunted version of the person she always wanted to be -- a writer who has given a measure of happiness and as writers can worked out a happy ending. The Golden Compass The alternate Victorian universe of ""The Golden Compass"" looks magical seethes with elusive profundities and makes remarkably little sense though the murkiness makes perfect sense on a shallower level. Thats because this elaborate fantasy was adapted from a trilogy of novels for young adults by the British author Philip Pullman an outspoken atheist. Something had to give -- either the big budget and the risks it entailed or the antireligious elements of Mr. Pullmans widely read epic which centers on a preteen orphan named Lyra Belacqua and identifies the source of all evil in the universe as ""The Magisterium"" an obvious stand-in for the Holy Church. (At least one Catholic group has called for a boycott of the film in advance of todays release.) The films scale certainly hasnt suffered. Sequence after sequence of the sumptuous production which was adapted and directed by Chris Weitz summons up visual wonders -- dueling digital polar bears a Jules Verne dirigible cruising over London an Oxford of green lawns and gleaming scientific instruments and at every turn peoples souls strolling alongside them in the form of animals called daemons. Clips Watch clips from ""Atonement"" and ""The Golden Compass."" The script retains the Magisterium an all-seeing and all-knowing institution that kidnaps children and ships them off to an Arctic facility where their souls are permanently separated from their bodies. But any religious implications have been scrupulously excised and replaced by an all-purpose all-familiar fascism vaguely evocative of ""Star Wars."" And the Dust of the Pullman novels which equated with Original Sin (at least from the Magisteriums point of view) now represents even more vaguely a connection to knowledge or an awareness of other worlds. Vagueness colors all banishing emotional connections in the process. Its hard to care about Lyras cosmic struggles against the Magisterium -- shes played by an attractive newcomer Dakota Blue Richards -- when youre confused about her relationship with Nicole Kidmans wicked but tender Marisa Coulter (or for that matter about why Lyras vague Cockney accent comes and goes). Similarly its hard to sustain interest in the good polar bear Iorek Byrnison when despite Ian McKellens rich voice he reminds you of more interesting creatures in ""The Lord of the Rings."" Daniel Craig makes a puzzlingly brief appearance as the mysterious explorer Lord Asriel and Sam Elliott shows up as a foxy American aeronaut. As for how the movie ends the short answer is that it doesnt. Rather than reconnect poor Lyra with the father shes been yearning to find as in the book this chronically disconnected screen version reaches a climax thats all about the next film in the series. Instead of closure we get coming attractions.    DVD TIP Christopher Hampton won a well-deserved Oscar for his adaptation of ""Dangerous Liaisons"" the 1988 triumph directed by Stephen Frears that starred John Malkovich Glenn Close and Michelle Pfeiffer. (The movie won two other Oscars for art direction and costume design.) Actually it was an adaptation of an adaptation the first one being Mr. Hamptons own 1985 stage version of the 1782 novel by Choderlos de Laclos. That same novel inspired another English-language feature the comparatively flat-footed ""Valmont"" which was released in 1989. But ""Dangerous Liaisons"" is the one to see a vibrant costume comedy about erotic power games and the power of acting and language.

"Epic tale struggles for direction - The Denver Post Entertainment Hot Topics Public Lands Day Colorado Unemployment New Denver Post Website Coming The Cannabist News Tips Print Email Font ResizeMoviesEpic tale struggles for direction1/2 FANTASY SHOWDOWNBy Lisa Kennedy Denver Post Film CriticPosted 12/07/2007 012103 AM MSTUpdated 12/12/2007 042251 PM MST (New Line Cinema ) Lyra Belacqua the hero of ""The Golden Compass"" is a wise and cracking-wise child. Lyras parents died in a zeppelin accident. Left in the care of scholars at Jordan College Oxford in a parallel universe much like our own shes curious and rebellious. And Dakota Blue Richards the newcomer who won the coveted role of author Philip Pullmans heroine breathes spirit into the girl. The compass of the title is an intricate device that doesnt suss out true north but points toward symbols that reveal the past the future the hidden. Or as one Gyptian tells Lyra ""It enables you to see what others want to hide."" One compass remains. One human lives to grasp its mysteries Lyra. Published beginning in the mid-1990s the best- selling trilogy -- ""The Golden Compass"" ""The Subtle Knife"" and ""The Amber Spyglass"" -- provides an alchemical tale of science and magic history and possibility the absolute power of a religious organization called the Magisterium and the alliances gathered to combat it. Known for his deft handling of the very different romantic comedies ""American Pie"" and ""About a Boy"" writer-director Chris Weitz has run into some trouble with the sagas rhythms. His ""Golden Compass"" feels like a truncated epic -- or a detailed trailer. In the age of overly long movies it may be hard to count this as a flaw. Yet Lyras journey to the North to save friend Roger and other children from sinister experiments is too brisk.Advertisement Its a Cliffs Notes rush to a wintery showdown. The clash of polar bear outcast Iorek Byrnison and polar bear king Ragnar Sturlusson actors Ian (McKellen) and Ian (McShane) is rousing. And if youre fond of uncanny depictions of talking emoting beasts then ""The Golden Compass"" has menagerie enough to engage. Back from his latest journey to the Arctic Lyras uncle Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig) has evidence of the elemental stuff not just of this realm but all universes ""dust."" Dust links parallel worlds. Dust links humans to their daemons the animal manifestations of a persons soul. Lions and wolves monkeys and insects rodents and birds cats and dogs aplenty stand by their humans advising them. The special-effects teams that animate these beings and the actors who lend them speech provide the movie with its most captivating hook. Childrens daemons shape shift because the young have not yet become set. Daemons often come in the gender opposite their humans. Lord Asriels ferocious cat speaks in the voice of Kristin Scott Thomas. Lyras Pantalaimon chatters in Freddie Highmores sweet tones. Sam Elliotts cowboy aeronaut Lee Scoresbys jackrabbit is voiced by Kathy Bates. A clothes horse of the first order Marisa Coulters demon might have been equine. Instead the soul of the Magisterium collaborator (Nicole Kidman in subzero mode) who lures Lyra away from Jordan College is represented by a golden monkey. When Coulter peers out an airship window on the trail of Lyra who escapes with the compass its easy to detect traces of another classic movie in which the heroine-child is chased by a baddie with a monkey on her back. ""The Golden Compass"" suffers in comparison with another saga one about a boy named Harry with the burdens of worlds upon him. In October the Catholic League called for a boycott pegging the film as a Trojan Horse to lure children into the multiplex only to have them demanding the books which are more muscular in their opposition to the power of organized religion. Some ""Dark Materials"" fans fretted Weitz would temper the trilogys philosophically loaded critique. Theres a less-controversial sin at work here. In book form the trilogy is a paean to curiosity and invention. Yet so little of these qualities is celebrated here. Lyra begins besieged. Lord Asriel doesnt appear particularly thrilled by his discovery. Sure knowledge is burden. Its also a pleasure. ""The Golden Compass"" is a sourpuss ""Da Vinci Code"" for movie-going youngsters. It arrives in theaters already overdebated. Yet a quandary nags Why is it so joyless? Lisa Kennedy 303-954-1567 or lkennedydenverpost.com; also on blogs.denverpostcom/madmoviegoer ""The Golden Compass"" PG-13 for sequences of fantasy violence. 1 hour 54 minutes. Written and directed by Christopher Weitz. From the book by Philip Pullman. Photography by Henry Braham. Starring Nicole Kidman Dakota Blue Richards Eva Green Sam Elliott Daniel Craig Tom Courtenay Derek Jacobi Jack Shepherd  Ben Walker and Simon McBurney and the voice talent of Ian McKellen Freddie Highmore Kathy Bates Kristin Scott Thomas and Ian McShane. Opens today at area theaters. This article has been corrected in this online archive. Originally due to a reporting error it incorectly referred to the animal manifestation of human souls in the film as ""demons."" The correct word is ""daemons.""

But The Golden Compass based on Philip Pullmans 1995 fantasy novel disappoints with its lack of character development and convoluted storytelling. Lyra (Dakota Blue Richards) is the plucky protagonist. The pre-pubescent girl journeys from a quiet college town to remote icy regions searching for children who have been mysteriously kidnapped. Adventures ensue. CLIP Get lost in The Golden Compass While the production design is glossy and appropriately fantastical and the special effects and computer-generated segments blend nicely with live-action characters the overall saga is surprisingly bland. Nicole Kidman does a devilishly effective job as an impeccably dressed villainess and Daniel Craig has a too-brief part as the mysterious adventurer who is Lyras guardian. The highlight is a visually dazzling duel between armor-plated polar bears (voiced by Ian McShane and Ian McKellen). Pullmans book is the first of a trilogy for young adults His Dark Materials so there are bound to be more movies. With the huge success of the film versions of the Harry Potter books the Lord of the Rings trilogy and Chronicles of Narnia this seems a no-brainer. Perhaps they can take a page out of the Potter book and change directors for each installment. While director Chris Weitz did a superb job adapting Nick Hornbys About a Boy this fantasy action saga with a message doesnt seem to be his strong suit. In the parallel universe in which the story is set every person has a ""daemon"" an animal spirit who accompanies him through life. A childs daemon often changes forms and audiences are likely to be enthralled by 12-year-old Lyras daemon Pantalaimon (voiced by Freddie Highmore) who shape-shifts from ermine to wildcat to hawk to moth. Lyra and her daemon set out on a search for the disappearing children and also to learn about a supernatural force called ""dust."" But the perils she faces never seem quite tense or exciting enough to fully draw us into the tale. She forms a bond with one of the polar bears Iorek (McKellen) but that connection too feels a bit lackluster. Most of the villainous characters are connected to a sanctimonious organization called the Magisterium which some readers have associated with the Catholic Church. The Catholic League has called for a boycott of the movie on the grounds that it promotes an atheist agenda. There is no overt reference in the film to Catholicism or any religion and the Magisterium officials are autocratic but not theologically oriented. Through Lyras character the film seems to focus on questioning authority of all stripes. Readers should be warned that the movie stops short of where the book concludes in order to guarantee a happy ending. Actually it feels like the kind of open-ended resolution that signifies a budding franchise.

Forty minutes into it I was wondering exactly the same thing. ""The Golden Compass"" a sort of ""The Empire Strikes Harry Potter of the Caribbean"" only with giant polar bears wearing suits of armor and punching each other in the face reminded me why I stopped reading sci-fi and fantasy when I was 15. It was the nouns. ""Hark thee my fair Stenerud and wield well this ancient benirschke. Journeyest then to the plain of Septien and unleash these yepremians with the longbow of Herrera . . . "" The best noun in a movie that gives you more of them than an SAT prep course is this one Coulter. Its the name of the ice-hearted blonde played by Nicole Kidman who is a powerful advocate for an evil organization bent on bringing dark times to the universe. How tickled is Ann C.? Shes probably adjusting her pointy black hat and zooming off to see the movie on her broomstick giggling through the night skies. Mrs. Coulter is trying to corrupt Lyra (Dakota Blue Richards) an innocent girl at a magical school in a parallel universe where everyone has a different variety of pet or ""daemon"" that acts as a guardian angel soul brother and concierge. The only character in the movie I remotely cared about was Lyras daemon who is alternately a talking ermine or bird or cat who is forever taking a beating from nastier creatures and looks awfully cute doing so. The girl whose uncle the stalwart Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig) has been targeted for elimination by the sinister ruling priests of the Vatican-like Magisterium has an aletheiometer or golden compass that promises unlimited knowledge to anyone who can figure out how to read its strange symbols. Lord Asriel goes off to the frozen north to search out a substance called Dust that brings free thinking to those it reaches and so poses a major threat to the rule of the Magisterium whose Dust-busting force from the General Oblation Board - the Gobblers - is trying to keep the Dust from liberating Lyra and the other kids. So goes the back story. And the front story as scene after scene brings new characters dropping in to explain the increasingly tedious details behind all this. Oh the Belaquas and the Bolvangars. The Gyptians. The intercission experiment. Sorting all this out yields a clanking allegory (Church bad; secular skepticism good) that sucks all the fun away while much more enticing-looking stuff - fanciful zeppelin docks and mysterious pirate ships - hovers frustratingly in the background like Christmas toys that go unused while toddlers play with the empty box. Worse its like toddlers ignoring the toys because theyre frowning over Nietzsche and sighing about the will to power and the ascetic ideal. Every 10 minutes or so the movie remembers its supposed to show us actual things happening so it throws in a half-hearted 30-second action scene (say Lyra being pestered by robot bugs or having to cross an icy gorge). Things pick up a little when in the second hour Lyra finds an ally in a fierce enslaved polar bear (voiced by Ian McKellen) but he too reels off a few pages of grudges and legends. They say youd pay good money to hear an actor like McKellen read the phone book. How about the Dungeons and Dragons manual? Long after Id lost interest or rather failed to locate any there came to pass two expensive-looking but uninvolving action scenes. One is a ho-hum battle near the end - the bad guys are Cossack-looking fellows who speak something that sounds like Russian requiring us to drag our eyes across subtitles that say things like ""Stop the children they cannot escape"" Theres also that strange biting/boxing match between McKellens good bear and an evil one. It ends without a lot more thrills than youd expect in a bout between say Naomi Campbell and her maid. The film is not as silly as it sounds; its much sillier. Remember the worst line in ""Star Wars""? ""But I was gonna go to the Tashi station to pick up some power converters"" Imagine a whole movie like that. Writer-director Chris Weitz who did nicely with a simple story in adapting ""About a Boy"" has been swamped by the task of condensing a densely imaginative 430-page book. Its as if given the task of setting up a display of animals that would fit in his living room he went to the city zoo and cut off a 6-inch portion of every beast then tossed the bloody chunks in a pile. The best you can say about ""The Golden Compass"" is that its merely the second-dullest Nicole Kidman/Daniel Craig film this year. kyle.smithnypost.com THE GOLDEN COMPASSChronicles of Yawnia.Running time 114 minutes.

"A difficult destination ultimately reached - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMOVIE REVIEWS A difficult destination ultimately reachedCompass was a tricky book to adapt to the screen but this version finds its way home.December 07 2007|Kenneth Turan | Times Staff Writer Some novels even the most potentially cinematic initially resist being made into films and so it is with ""The Golden Compass.""Watching writer-director Chris Weitzs ultimately satisfying and successful version of the opening volume of the celebrated ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy you can feel the strain of fitting Philip Pullmans dazzling feat of sophisticated imagination onto the screen even with the luxury of a reported 180-million budget.For Pullmans books the most literate and intellectually exciting fantasy novels since ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy are works of startling richness. They posit a world parallel to and similar to our own but with key differences the most noticeable being the existence of daemons small talking animals of varying sorts who walk next to the humans they are connected to and are the physical manifestation of their souls.The story of ""The Golden Compass"" is the story of Lyra (newcomer Dakota Blue Richards) a feisty 12-year-old who lives without parents as a ward of one of Oxfords colleges. In an attempt to rescue one of her small friends who has gone missing for mysterious reasons Lyra goes on a journey to the far north that involves her explorer uncle Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig) and Mrs. Coulter (Nicole Kidman) a powerful woman whos taken an interest in the youngster.To put Lyras mind-bending almost unimaginable world on screen to create a reality where flying witches share the skies with antiquated airships enormous talking armored bears fight to the death and daemons walk and talk in almost every frame is a monumental challenge and one that the film handsomely meets.Working with production designer Dennis Gassner and cinematographer Henry Braham senior visual effects supervisor Michael Fink has turned ""The Golden Compass"" into a formidable piece of craftsmanship using some 1100 effects shots to bring forth a physical space that has the ability to take your breath away. And using top talent such as Kathy Bates and Kristin Scott Thomas for the voices of the daemons not to mention the peerless Ian McKellen as the armored bear Iorek Byrnison also adds to the verisimilitude.Difficult as all this is to accomplish getting the storys philosophical underpinnings and dramatic intricacies on screen is even harder. Whenever a book like ""The Golden Compass"" gets turned into a movie its inevitable that the story will be simplified characters will lose nuance and in this case rousing battle scenes will be emphasized and heightened at the expense of more introspective elements.One simplification is the role of the Magisterium the paternalistic ruling authority in Lyras world. In Pullmans novel this overbearing group is unmistakably a church which has drawn the ire of some Catholic groups but in the film though the Magisteriums representatives dress like religious functionaries all references to church connections have been removed.Still though it takes some doing ""The Golden Compass"" retains enough tastes and traces of the original to fascinate and involve viewers. This is especially important because as opposed to for instance ""The Lord of the Rings"" or even the Harry Potter books this is a noticeably cool story one whose most memorable connections are intellectual rather than emotional.So while the books world reveals itself to us gradually the films opening voice-over gives us a direct and quick introduction to that cosmos a kind of Golden Compass 101 that lets us know where we are and how things work.Then brash young Lyra comes on the scene and soon enough is eavesdropping on the dashing intrepid Lord Asriel who has made a flying visit to Oxford to talk about his discoveries on a substance called dust. These mystical particles congregate around the Arctic Circle and Asriel is determined to track them down even though the ruling Magisterium is equally determined that knowledge of dust be obliterated from the world.Naturally Lyra wants to go with her uncle but he tells her that ""dust is none of your business"" and brusquely advises her to be a good girl before he disappears again. (Craig is fine in this role but it is an abbreviated one.)Much more friendly at least on the surface is the ice queen Mrs. Coulter (a delicious turn for Kidman) a vision in gold down to a golden monkey as a daemon. She is a bit of an explorer herself and offers to take Lyra with her as an assistant on her next voyage north and the overjoyed girl agrees.Before she leaves the college however the master gives her an alethiometer the golden compass of the title the only one left in existence. Once you learn how to read it this beautiful object reveals the truth of a situation enabling you to ""see what others seek to hide."" Certainly a good thing to have on a journey.1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESCowboy biker . . . rabbit?December 6 2007Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-compass7dec07,1,2012443.story?coll=la-entnews-movies&ctrack=1&cset=true",200,thegoldencompass17,thegoldencompass,latimes

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.May 1 2009 355 PM The Golden Compass Philip Pullmans subversive fantasy gets put through the Hollywood blandification machine. By Dana Stevens To listen to Slates Spoiler Special about The Golden Compass click the arrow button on the player Dakota Blue Richards in The Golden Compass Whenever Im planning to write on a movie thats a literary adaptation of a major work I typically read the book first. As a result Ive read some fine books this fall Ian McEwans Atonement Gabriel Garcia Marquezs Love in the Time of Cholera Jean-Dominique Baubys The Diving Bell and the Butterfly. But when it came to The Golden Compass writer/director Chris Weitzs adaptation of the first book in the fantasy trilogy His Dark Materials by Philip Pullman I wanted to go in knowing as little about the source material as possible. Not just because getting through the 700-plus pages of the trilogy would have required a months leave but because Pullmans fictional universe seemed so sui generis so dazzlingly weird that I wanted to see if the movie could establish that universes laws and logic on its own terms. Im here to tell you that without at least a working knowledge of the Dark Materials cosmos Weitzs adaptation is a near-impenetrable murk a blur of CGI beasties shimmering dust clouds and vaguely mystical blather. To prove my point Ill try to describe the plot without any recourse to what I know of the books An orphan girl named Lyra (Dakota Blue Richards) is being brought up as the ward of an institution known as Jordan College. Its run by a priestlike cabal known as the Magisterium (we know they must be bad because theyre headed up by Simon McBurney the go-to character actor for your bloodless-bureaucrat needs). During a visit from her uncle the mysterious scientist Lord Asriel (an underemployedDaniel Craig) Lyra comes into possession of the golden compass a kind of cosmological BlackBerry that can access any piece of knowledge from past present or future. Lyra tipped off by the compass that shes destined to discover why children are being abducted to the Arctic North takes off in a zeppelin with the beautiful but remote Mrs. Coulter (Nicole Kidman) a trustee of the college whos somehow in league with the Magisterium. Advertisement I confess that I may have taken a tiny nap at this point (the swirling Alexandre Desplat score was making me drowsy) but somehow we end up in Norway where Lyra having escaped the increasingly menacing Mrs. Coulter befriends a disgraced bear-king named Iorek Byrnison (voiced by Ian McKellen) and a wise Texan aeronaut Mr. Scoresby (Sam Elliot). After Iorek wins back his bear kingdom in a battle with the foolish King Ragnar (voiced by Ian McShane) this merry band sets out for points farther north where they must rescue the kidnapped children from becoming guinea pigs in an unspeakable experiment. That lengthy precis represents only a skimpy description of the films story. But as incoherent as my summary may seem its nowhere near as cursory as the treatment Weitzs adaptation gives to the novel. After several post-movie conversations with Pullman fans (all of which were twice as entertaining and enlightening as the movie itself) Ive gathered that His Dark Materials is a vastly ambitious rewrite of the Book of Genesis enacting the fall of man in reverse as Lyra the new Eve discovers that the possibility of sin and of sexuality represents not a flaw in creation but rather the source of all human power. Christian activists who fear that this movie will spread the books anti-clerical pro-sex message can relax in the knowledge that not a scrap of Pullmans theology has made it through the Hollywood blandification machine. New Line should market the film to churches with the tag line ""Not only wont you be offended by The Golden Compass youll have no idea whats going on"" Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. In one of the few ideas that has survived intact from the book each human being in Lyras world has a daemon an animal that follows them around like a kind of external soul. Its a magnificent conceit and one thats stunningly rendered by juxtaposing computer-animated animals with live actors. (Nicole Kidmans daemon is an obsequious gold monkey and Daniel Craigs fittingly an elegant snow leopard.) The all-CGI battle of the bears (or ""clash of the Ians"" as McKellen and McShane compete for the title of Most Regal Ursine Voice) is the films central set piece and its most exciting moment. But without knowing more about the stakes of this fight and the place of the bear kingdom in the human world even this thrilling scene adds up to little more than a jaunty animal fight downloaded from YouTube. Even I know enough about Pullmans books to know that a movie adaptation of the series could have been something truly beautiful and strange a myth about a childs quest to liberate the human race from God. Instead The Golden Compass is a tepid jumbled Hollywood fable whose final message seems to amount to little more than ""Follow your dreams"" or worse ""Stay tuned for the sequel.""

"Movie review Golden Compass a thoughtful fantasy world - Mercury News Opinion Hot Topics Big Sur fire Balloon crash No-parachute skydive Deadline 29 to Vegas Sheryl Sandbergs Option B Steve Torrence Ask Amy Comics SV150 Print Email Font ResizeMovie review Golden Compass a thoughtful fantasy worldBy Bruce NewmanMercury NewsPosted 12/06/2007 011137 PM PSTUpdated 12/08/2007 094125 AM PSTClick photo to enlargeDakota Blue Richards stars in ""The Golden Compass."" <<12>>Unlike screen adaptations of the ""Harry Potter"" books or the Disneyfication of ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" - movies that anyone can enjoy without giving them a second thought - ""The Golden Compass"" introduces a world of myth and mystery that requires patience and a certain mental aptitude to figure out. Its a place fraught with parallel worlds and Animal Planet fashion accessories. Where else are you going to find Sam Elliott - in full cowboy hat and twang - speaking to an up-armored white bear who sounds like (and is) Ian McKellen? If you are Lyra Belacqua (Dakota Blue Richards) the 12-year-old orphan who is the storys heroine - not to mention the movies heart and soul - how you find all these remarkable things and navigate the movies tricky terrain is with an Alethiometer. Thats the official name for the golden compass that guides Lyra through Philip Pullmans ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy first published in England in 1995 two years before J.K. Rowlings ""Potter"" series began. An Alethiometer is the global-positioning equivalent of a watch that tells you its two freckles past a hair Eastern elbow time. Not terribly useful. Unless of course you are able to discern from a compass heading that appears to include a picture of a bear and a picture of a lightning bolt that you should set out immediately for the Arctic Circle. This is the sort of thing that Lyra does with comparative ease closing her eyes and becoming engulfed in a cloud of golden dust.Advertisement Deciphering the compasss clues remains infernally difficult for the rest of us which is why Lyra is soon being spoken of as some sort of ""chosen one."" Among other story elements that term has set off a backlash against the film by church groups who believe Pullmans books to be anti-religion. Lyra is the whip-smart-but-rebellious ward of Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig) who is apparently some sort of Indiana Jones of a dimension visible only to him. He wants Jordan College to fund his exploration of these parallel worlds and before decamping for parts unknown to await the movies inevitable sequel Asriel introduces us to the Kingdom of the Ice Bears. He even shows some faculty geezers a picture of dust coming from the sky. Obviously the grant application process works a little differently in England. The schools master is the one who gives the worlds last Alethiometer to Lyra and he does so with apparent confidence that she will figure out how to use it. ""It tells the truth"" he says handing the contraption over to her easy as you please as if it were made of Fruit Roll-ups instead of solid gold. ""This lets you glimpse things as they are."" Hes pretty sure shell need some kind of lie detector and for good reason. He has just agreed to allow Mrs. Coulter (Nicole Kidman) the gold-plated moll of the Magisterium - a mysterious power-hungry order that seems to have a grudge against all children - to take Lyra with her to Norway. Shimmering across a long dining hall in gold lame and platinum blond hair Kidman looks as if she just stepped out of a remake of ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"" a wicked virago vision of Marilyn Monroe with plumped lips. The adaptation of Pullmans book is by Chris Weitz (""About a Boy"") who is parsimonious about revealing the secrets of the Magisterium. When Lyra asks Mrs. Coulter what the Magisterium is as the two of them soar across London in a red and gold zeppelin Mrs. C replies that the evil order tells people what to do but ""in a kindly way."" It doesnt take a golden compass to know thats a whopper but the movie quickly removes all doubt about the groups villainy by installing inter-galactic bad guy Christopher Lee as its First High Councilor. The only conceivable casting clue less subtle than that would be if theyd hired Darth Vader for the part. In its own way ""The Golden Compass"" is a sequel of sorts coming from the same studio that produced ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. Some of the action set pieces at the Arctic Circle may remind you of the ""Rings"" movies and while Weitz lacks Peter Jacksons obvious operatic flair for fantasy the big action scenes work on their own terms. Kidman probably isnt the ideal choice for Mrs. Coulter; she seems to have trouble conveying some of the characters ambiguity. Craig is a marquee name with very little to do and as a result many of the best performances are vocal McKellen brings the great bear Iorek roaring to life and Freddie Highmore is sweet as Lyras daemon one of the animal companions every human has. The movies strongest selling point is Lyra herself not just a welcome change from all the boy seekers of knowledge and truth in the ""Harry Potter"" and ""Rings"" pictures. She gets plenty of help from Elliotts cowboy aviator Lee Scoresby the friendly witch Serafina (Eva Green) and an unforgettable bear. Lyra has more pre-pubescent girl power than any screen heroine since ""Whale Rider"" and there is enough fire in Dakota Blue Richards first film performance to make you eager for the next installment in the series.

Comments The Golden Compass Christian-right types have warned that this mega-budget childrens fantasy will make me want to kill God--a neat reversal because when watching mega-budget childrens fantasies I usually want him to kill me. A recent Atlantic Monthly story details how the first installment in Philip Pullmans antireligious trilogy ""His Dark Materials"" has been neutered by New Line Cinema and writer-director Chris Weitz (About a Boy). I dont know the book but whats on-screen is an innocuous passably entertaining effects extravaganza. Dakota Blue Richards discovered in an open audition plays a little girl who recruits a grouchy polar bear to help rescue her kidnapped brother from the evil Magisterium (i.e. the Christian church). Among the big-name stars are a wonderfully icy Nicole Kidman a comically Texan Sam Elliott and a blandly noble Daniel Craig. PG-13 118 min. By J.R.

Lets go with the latter. Director Chris Weitz also wrote the screenplay based on the first book in Philip Pullmans His Dark Materials trilogy. If you have a friend who has read the books buy him a ticket and take him along. Youll need him. Otherwise you will find yourself scratching your head at a movie that tries way too hard to do way too much in way too short a time. The gist or at least part of it is that there are many universes held together by dust. Not evidently the dust that settles on furniture though there is a great moment in which the evil Marisa Coulter (a frosty-by-design Nicole Kidman) says ""Dust is none of your business"" - it sounds like a commercial for Lemon Pledge. No this dust is something more cosmic. The Magisterium - the Catholic Church some would argue but youd have a hard time gleaning it from the film - wants to suppress knowledge of dust when its not busy trying to suppress everything else. Toward the end Lyra Belacqua (Dakota Blue Richards) the movies heroine tells a friend ""I want to know what dust is."" You and me both kid. But not so badly that Id sit through a sequel to find out. Some religious groups worry that although the movie does not explicitly denounce religion it may intrigue kids to read Pullmans books which are more explicit in their criticism. Not likely. Instead The Golden Compass is far more likely to lead them to the local Blockbuster so they can rent The Lord of the Rings again. Lyra lives at a university until shes whisked off by Coulter ostensibly for travel and exploration. Actually Coulter wants to take from Lyra the last remaining Alethiometer also known as the golden compass and a good thing - Alethiometer doesnt make much of a movie title. Its a contraption that can tell the truth about anything. Coulters also involved in a project to separate kids from their daemons which are animal representations of their soul or some such. Better to not think too much and just go with it. Makes for interesting computer animation if nothing else. Lyra escapes and with the help of the Gyptians heads north to try to find a missing friend and put a halt to the experiments the Magisterium is conducting on abducted children. Along the way she encounters all sorts of interesting creatures including a talking bear (voice of Ian McKellen) a witch (Eva Green) and of all things a Texan (Sam Elliott at his yee-haw-iest). On her arrival Lyra a plucky sort sets about to free the children. Of course this being a fantasy film this cant happen without the requisite Epic Battle Scene. This actually is valuable to kids - the last-minute saves are so implausible they serve as repeated examples of deus ex machina. Indeed you know youre on shaky ground when your films best fight isnt the climactic one but an earlier one between two animated bears. Richards is quite good as Lyra the only truly developed character of the lot. But the slapdash jumping among plot points shoots down whatever momentum the movie might have built so that in the end The Golden Compass is less controversial than it is confusing. So naturally it sets up for a sequel. Now that might be worth protesting. Reach the writer at 602-444-8974 or bill .goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Read his blog at goodyblog. azcentral.com.

And what has put resilient resourceful kids - or hobbits (kids with furry feet) - at the epicenter as heroes? Philip Pullmans His Dark Materials trilogy (a title taken from Miltons ""Paradise Lost"") isnt quite on the same mega-selling plane as Harry Potter The Lord of the Rings or The Chronicles of Narnia but the English authors tale of a feisty girl in a kind of parallel universe U.K. has its legions of fans. And now they have a movie. If the box-office gods look kindly on this inaugural installment itll be a movie franchise too. Lets hope so. A smartly realized adaptation from the American director Chris Weitz (whose credits include cowriting American Pie and codirecting with his brother About a Boy) The Golden Compass is set in a 19th century-ish steampunk world - a dramatic place of gargantuan zeppelins and sailing ships intricately crafted clockwork winged insects a slow-talkin cowpoke (Sam Elliott) and a dapper Oxford don/adventurer (Daniel Craig). And then there is the Alethiometer - the golden compass of the title a magical doodad that delivers the truthful answer to any question asked of it. Dickensian scamp Lyra Belacqua (newcomer Dakota Blue Richards) raised in a manner of speaking by her uncle Lord Asriel (Craig) comes into possession of this rare instrument thereby landing herself in the thick of an epic conflict. On one side the repressive Magesterium a body of dour-faced control freaks who want the compass badly. On the other various ragtag bands (and talking polar bears) who believe in stuff like free will and will fight for the right to party - I mean think and act freely. In Pullmans books its the Catholic Church that functions as the institutional bad guy. Trying to dodge a bullet - and a major controversy - Weitz and the folks at New Line Cinema fuzzied things up presenting a ritual-besotted hierarchical authoritarian outfit but one without any Christian trappings. Conservative religious groups are nonetheless campaigning against the film (I have the e-mails to prove it) but really the way Weitz and company have reconceived Pullmans enrobed nemeses theyre less about the Vatican than they are about Sauron and his gang or Narnias wicked Snow Queen or Potters Valdemort. Evildoers. And evildoers who want to suck the souls from children - souls represented in Pullmans ""multiverse"" as animals or daemons. Every human has one Lord Asriels is a snow leopard the seductive secretive Mrs. Coulter (Nicole Kidman) walks in step with a golden monkey. And the children? Their daemons change from one animal to another reflecting the unformed nature of a childs spirit. If Weitzs Golden Compass feels at times too crammed with exposition and big set pieces the film nonetheless works far more successfully than the first Potter pic - the leaden Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone - did translating its source material. Visually The Golden Compass is dazzling hopscotching from hallowed halls of academe to the Nordic tundra from luxe manors to creepy sci-fi-like facilities. The effects couldnt be better. Richards plucked from an open-call audition is a find. The newcomer brings sparks and smarts to the role of Lyra still trying to figure out who she is and how her special talents might save the day (or days). If shes lucky and New Line decides to go ahead with The Subtle Knife and The Amber Spyglass Richards will have a hard time shrugging Ms. Belacqua from her life. The Golden Compass  (out of four stars) Directed by Chris Weitz. With Dakota Blue Richards Daniel Craig Sam Elliott Nicole Kidman and the voice of Ian McKellen. Distributed by New Line Cinema.

You could argue that the movie does its job since it keeps giving you things to gawk at. Look a sky darkens as it fills up with witches Look a pair of polar bears engage in an Arctic smackdown worthy of the WWE Look its Nicole Kidman -- her creamy shoulders tensing her eyebrows dancing with dark delight -- acting hot enough to belong in an entirely different film Some of this qualifies as spectacle but very little of it takes hold as organic wonder. Perhaps thats because writer-director Chris Weitz adapting the first novel in Philip Pullmans His Dark Materials trilogy has made a movie that flirts with theological solemnity yet fuzzes it out at the same time. The Golden Compass is a chronicle of blarnia. The movie like the trilogy has already been attacked by the Catholic Church which has accused Compass of being an attack upon it. Yet the cleansing sternness of Pullmans vision has mostly been wiped away leaving a film that knows what its against (frowning white-haired conspiracists in fussy clerical suits) but never quite figures out a way to voice what its for. As the movie opens we could be in a novel by Jules Verne. Lyra 12 years old is played by Dakota Blue Richards who has the ringlets of a 60s Disney heroine and a lot of charming Irish pluck. Lyra is the ward of Jordan College an Oxbridge-like institution that looks like something out of the 1890s -- except that the surrounding city has a sci-fi celestial glow full of contraptions like a nifty wooden blimp and street vehicles that whir with futuristic precision. Its also full of smarmy bad guys who belong to the Magisterium an authoritarian star chamber with a dastardly plan. Lyra like all of her orphaned school chums is accompanied by her ""daemon"" a talking animal spirit-companion -- hers is a cat -- that shape-shifts into other animals even as it remains a mischievous reflection of her own soul. Its no accident these creatures are referred to by a word that conjures devils They are meant (at least in Pullmans books) to suggest the potential for sin embedded in the life force. Thats what the Magisterium wants to demolish. The organization has taken a passel of children including Lyras best friend (Ben Walker) to the frozen North for the purpose of separating them from their daemons turning them into neuterized clones of goodness. Do you see why the Catholic Church objected? In outline The Golden Compass is a protest against organized piety yet the suggestive power of daemons and also of the mystic substance known as ""Dust"" (no the Magisterium isnt crazy about that one either) is just window dressing for a poky one-dimensional rescue adventure. Lyra must first elude the clutches of the aristocratic Magisterium comrade Mrs. Coulter (Kidman) who traps her in her mansion. This part of the film has some brio thanks mostly to Kidmans high-style villainy. Lyra however quickly escapes and ends up trekking to the North where she meets a great big bunch of critters and characters. They are not very enthralling and neither is Lyras odyssey. Ian McKellen voices Byrnison an ""ice bear"" with a gruff sad scarred exterior and a heart of softest gold. The force of McKellens voice could wake anyone up as he alchemizes Byrnisons melancholy into triumphant anger but I wish Lyra had a few quieter scenes with him. Shes too busy banding with the Gyptians a crew of tedious nomads or with the sexy witch Serafina (the lustrous Eva Green in too ill-defined a role) or with Sam Elliott as a roving Texas airman (say what?) the actors overcooked-grits basso drawl more precious than ever. The titular compass which allows Lyra to answer any question put to her by letting her mind drift through psychedelic sprinkles should have been more central to the plot. Its a magical-mechanical MacGuffin. Daniel Craig in case you were wondering is in the movie for about 10 minutes as Lyras tweedy professorial uncle who goes off to the North in search of Dust. (One presumes hell have a larger role in the sequel.) And just what is Dust? To judge from the post-movie discussions I heard those who have read the books will feel far more enlightened about it than those with little to go on but the occasional sprinkle of gold. Thats the kind of movie The Golden Compass is a fantasy that leaves you chattering about particles. C Want more?

Another holiday movie season another fantastic mythological universe to contend with. This time its the world -- or multiple parallel worlds -- of Philip Pullmans ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy the first installment of which is ""The Golden Compass"" or ""Northern Lights"" in its original 1995 British publication. New Lines bid for another ""Lord of the Rings"" bonanza kicks off with writer-director Chris Weitzs impressively rendered but oddly uninviting adventure about a chosen girls momentous struggle against insidious forces that would extinguish free will. Visual splendor and scent of a franchise should lure considerable crowds especially internationally although its doubtful ""Compass"" will find a B.O. path anywhere near ""Narnia"" much less Middle-earth. A sensation in the U.K. although less so Stateside Pullmans epic is grounded in a land very much like England with an expedition to the arctic stretches of Norway. But the work more broadly concerns the war between a rational scientific domain and the monolithic oppression exercised by the power-mad Magisterium a hierarchical order intent upon claiming the souls of all children. Its this undisguised anti-religious theme that has numerous groups in a lather but perhaps more of an issue for some auds will be the films lack of exciting uplift and the almost unrelievedly nasty treatment of the young characters by a host of aggressively unpleasant elders. Front and center is Lyra Belacqua (newcomer Dakota Blue Richards) a 12-year-old orphan who has enjoyed the privilege of being raised at the august Jordan College. Brown-haired and with bit of a wild edge Richards has an unusual presence for a tweeny leading lady but certain questions immediately present themselves If Lyra has spent her entire life in this rarefied academic environment why does she like her rough-and-tumble mates and best friend Roger (Ben Walker) speak with a sort of mild working-class accent and bad grammar? Although shes called an untamed rebel her status within the institution and her connections with those around her are not well fixed at the outset. To the horror of the Magisterium elite Lyras distinguished uncle Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig) has discovered evidence in the Arctic Circle of golden dust that might establish a mystical connection between the many imagined parallel worlds. Lyra also becomes the secret recipient of the last remaining Alethiometer or Golden Compass a device that can provide the true answer to any question. When Roger vanishes Lyra jumps at the chance to go north where abducted kids have purportedly been taken with the shimmering Mrs. Coulter (Nicole Kidman) whose overly solicitous manner with Lyra masks an unfriendly agenda. Off they fly above a fanciful London aboard an even more fanciful flying ship that resembles a combination of a Zeppelin and Captain Nemos Nautilus. A distinguishing feature of Pullmans world is that every human being has an animal companion called a daemon that often verbally or physically expresses whats going on inside that person. With children including Lyra the animal frequently changes species to reflect the unsettled nature of young personalities whereas adults daemons are fixed. This conceit can produce comic results when two people come into conflict and their respective daemons act it out; unusually for an ostensibly youth-oriented film the critters are scarcely used to cutesy effect. To its credit ""The Golden Compass"" panders hardly at all in the usual kidpic ways. In fact what Lyra finds the kidnapped children subjected to in the far north is little short of torture. To battle the forces of evil Lyra enlists a diverse collection of allies among them cowboy aviator Lee Scorsesby (Sam Elliott in typically iconic form) friendly flying witch Serafina (Eva Green) some vagabonds called gyptians and best of all a mighty white bear named Iorek. Pics first great set piece is a fight to the death between Iorek and the Norths bear king. Voicing these two warriors respectively Ian McKellen and Ian McShane try to out-baritone one another as their armored CGI counterparts roar paw and bite until only one is left standing in a genuinely exciting sequence. Soon thereafter comes a big chaotic battle on ice involving multiple factions which if not quite of ""Rings""-like proportions still packs a significant punch. Conclusion settles the dramas pressing matters for the moment which reps a departure from the tomes cliffhanger ending a choice perhaps made because New Line unlike with ""Rings"" is waiting to gauge the reaction to ""Compass"" before proceeding with the next installment. Weitz (""About a Boy"") who has never directed a film with anything like these logistics before is saddled with conveying loads of exposition but handles the big scenes competently. Still the prevailing tone is cold which has nothing to do with the frigid settings of the second half and the pic doesnt invite the viewer to enthusiastically enter into this new dramatic realm. Evoking the technological and sartorial world of the 1930s the visuals decked out with almost constant CGI adornments provide a constant feast for the eyes. Creatures especially the bears are strongly rendered and the enterprise lacks for little in production values. Kidmans Mrs. Coulter reps a problem in that her contradictory intentions cant really be sorted out; shes clearly up to no good but she also has genuine reasons for wanting to be close to Lyra that make her obvious deception annoying. Kidman herself seems unduly brittle and unsettled under her superficial poise and elegant duds. Craig has very little to do after his preliminaries although presumably his role would come to the fore in later editions. Among the villainous Magisterium elders Simon McBurney cuts the most entertainingly odious figure. As for Richards only time will tell if her characterization will grow beyond the willful somewhat impatient girl who quickly adjusts to having others do her bidding. Young thesp has something going for her but she like the film does not engender ready capitulation. Alexandre Desplats active score while not his most distinctive remains above the norm for this sort of project.
