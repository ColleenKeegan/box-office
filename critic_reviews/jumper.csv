WETA/Twentieth Century Fox and Regency Enterprises hide caption toggle caption WETA/Twentieth Century Fox and Regency Enterprises Hayden Christensen plays ""jumper"" David Rice able to teleport instantly to any corner of the planet. WETA/Twentieth Century Fox and Regency Enterprises Director Doug LimanGenre Adventure Sci-FiRunning Time 88 minutes Only after he falls through ice into a river and instead of drowning finds himself dripping wet in the stacks of a public library does David realize he can teleport to anywhere he can imagine. (I hear your question Hes hypothermic and imagining library stacks? Well give the kid a break. Maybe they keep them really warm.) Anyway Davis is a ""jumper"" and though he doesnt yet realize it there are plenty of other folks just like him. Alas for him there are also looming threats ""Paladins"" who immobilize jumpers with electric currents before stabbing them and screenwriters who immobilize movie concepts with lame writing before shooting them. The plot is more or less incoherent with travelogue footage digitally altered to put David atop a pyramid one moment and astride a glacier the next. And its not particularly clarified by either the screenplay -- a phrase in Chinese leads to scenes in Tokyo -- or Doug Limans direction which amounts to a frenetic primer on jump-cutting. I suppose if youre going to cast the blankly handsome Hayden Christensen as your lead it makes sense to make the character a cipher. Alas the drawback is that theres no reason to care what happens to him -- a fact that hasnt kept the filmmakers from suggesting unending sequels in their finale.

By Anthony Lane Samuel L. Jackson and Hayden Christensen in Doug Limans movie.   Credit EDEL RODRIGUEZ Bring back James Cameron. An unlikely sentiment I realize given the animosity that millions still nourish toward ""Titanic"" and its creator who seems to regard himself if the 1997 Academy Awards are anything to go by as a mixture of Moses and Erich von Stroheim. Yet there is no gainsaying his strongest work; the Cameron who made ""Aliens"" ""The Abyss"" and the first two ""Terminator"" films remains one of the few directors capable of shouldering an outlandish concept and bearing it onward to its coherent end. In his hands science fiction assumes the hard metallic sheen of plausible fact whereas the longer I suffer each new configuration of ""Spider-Man"" ""Fantastic Four"" ""Batman"" and ""X-Men"" the more I sense a reluctance on the part of directors to think their narratives through and the louder the hiss of deflation as a neat amusing idea runs out of puff. Nowhere is the comedown more depressing than in ""Jumper"" directed by Doug Liman which features Hayden Christensen as a master of teleportation named David Rice. For those of you unfamiliar with the basics of teleporting heres how to do it taking your cue from Maria von Trapp you simply remember your favorite things or at least your favorite place on the planet and letting off a little bwoompff sound youre there. I tried it several times in the course of this frantic film hoping to land inside a calm sanatorium in the Swiss Alps but no dice. Davids initial jump when hes a teen-ager leaves him beached and gasping like a fish on of all places the floor of the Ann Arbor public library--a witty detail for so unbookish a film. ""How does this thing work?"" he asks himself. ""How can I control it?"" These questions are never satisfactorily answered. Instead we ourselves leap ahead to the adult David who by now is jumping purely for pleasure. His idea of a sweet night out is to teleport himself to London pick up a girl sleep with her then breakfast the following morning atop the Sphinx before hopping off to Fiji for a healing surf. All flesh is as grass however and Davids delights are about to be cropped short by Roland (Samuel L. Jackson) one of the Paladins--an elite squad of killjoys trained to hunt and destroy all Jumpers on earth. Lord knows what drives the Paladins aside from a Calvinistic scorn of man as epicure. Once theyve finished with the Jumpers presumably theyll get to work on the smokers. ""Star Wars"" fans will remember Hayden Christensen as the young Anakin Skywalker or to be accurate as a kind of handsome void where Anakin was supposed to be. (In the new film he and Jackson himself a former Jedi grapple with what looks like a sawn-off light sabre.) One day I feel sure the rich mantle of charisma will descend upon him but ""Jumper"" is not that occasion. In any case the fault lies with Liman and his screenwriters--David S. Goyer Jim Uhls and Simon Kinberg--who cheerfully beam their hero around the globe and then have no clue what to do with him. David has a wall of picture postcards in Manhattan; one glance at the location on a card and he can spirit himself there. (Needless to say the movie quietly drops this visualization theme when it becomes a drag.) Such restlessness I would argue does not ipso facto make him a dude or a man of the world; it simply makes him an accelerated tourist and the whole of ""Jumper"" comes across as vastly incurious about the cultures at its command. When David takes Millie (Rachel Bilson) a school friend from Michigan for a dirty day out in Rome she stands in awe before the Colosseum. ""This place is amazing"" she declares. ""Its so cool."" I wasnt expecting Ernst Gombrich but surely three writers among them could inject a touch of class. The two reasons to see ""Jumper"" are Michael Rooker who plays Davids father (and suggests uncannily what Heath Ledger might have looked like in middle age) and Jamie Bell in the role of a fellow-Jumper named Griffin. Where David is semi-suave and hedonistic Griffin is hurried and hirsute zipping back to his grungy desert lair whenever danger looms. The film pretty much evaporates at the close as if the production had to wrap early in time for lunch and Griffins character is left shamefully dangling but not before he and David have enjoyed a strenuous fight jump-cutting from war zone to road to river with every punch. The result is more or less a remake of the great scene in ""Sherlock Jr."" where a dozing Buster Keaton dreams himself through a shuffled sequence of backgrounds. ""Jumper"" is ten times as brutal maybe a thousand times more costly and eighty-four years late but its a start. The new Michel Gondry film ""Be Kind Rewind"" is set in Passaic New Jersey. It stars Jack Black as Jerry a shambling logorrheic loser who lives in a trailer and idles his days away in a local video store owned by Mr. Fletcher (Danny Glover) and staffed by the benevolent Mike (Mos Def). One day after an unfortunate incident at a power plant next to his trailer Jerry finds himself magnetized--these things happen I guess--with the result that he unwittingly wipes every tape on Mr. Fletchers shelves. The solution is perfectly obvious Jerry and Mike will shoot their own versions of popular films beginning with ""Ghostbusters"" record them onto the blank tapes rent them out and hope that regular customers--like the daffy Ms. Falewicz (Mia Farrow) who looks like she got wiped years ago herself--wont notice the difference. This is a charming conceit designed as a paean to the ramshackle; sadly every minute of Gondrys film is irrefutable proof that charm is not enough. The rule seems to be that whenever he directs other peoples scripts--as he did with ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" written by Charlie Kaufman--he is able to negotiate a truce or even a merger between the logical and the fantastic whereas when he writes his own material as in ""The Science of Sleep"" and ""Be Kind Rewind"" anything that smacks of common sense is rejected as a gross inconvenience. To take the most basic of objections how many video-only stores do you know? It would hardly have stretched the budget to set the action in the late nineteen-eighties when video was rampant; in fact the new movie has the flimsiness of a comedy from that era (remember the robot in ""Short Circuit"" touched off by a lightning strike?) and half of the films that Mike and Jerry seek to revitalize are of similar vintage. If you can think of nothing more hilarious than Jack Black strapping on used auto parts and pretending to be Robocop then here is the movie you want. The outcome is a strangely sundered one torn between the claims of nostalgia and a desperate bid to seduce the YouTube generation. There are thousands of people doing what Mike and Jerry do but few of them would even know what a video was preferring to shoot on digital and post their spoofs online. This user-generated content as it is called marks either a long-overdue democratization of the arts or if you prefer a mass proliferation of the mediocre and Gondry had the opportunity to rise above it by crafting a thoroughly professional fable about amateurs. He blew his chance and most of ""Be Kind Rewind"" feels as silly and undisciplined as the mini-movies cooked up by its hapless heroes. These incidentally we are invited to view in their entirety by visiting the movies Web site. Thanks but Ill pass. Given that nod to current trends the films finale comes across as a willful throwback. One evening Mike and Jerrys last production is shown to the community projected onto a screen it grows visible through the window and everyone throngs in the street to watch perched on stoops like kids in an Andy Hardy picture. The moment is pinched I suspect from a scene in ""Cinema Paradiso"" when Philippe Noiret projected an old movie onto a wall of a town square but that was a miraculous visitation in a place adrift from the wide world and it was beautifully spliced into the sentimental efficiency of the whole story. Twenty-first-century New Jersey though is another matter and if Gondry really thinks that he can will his movie not to mention his audience back into a state of innocence hes kidding himself. Hats off to Mos Def then who is plainly unbeguiled by the folly around him--you can hear it in his voice which barely swells beyond a sleepy murmur as if he had just rolled out of bed. No such luck for Jack Black who perhaps because Gondry was too busy giggling over his own script appears not to have been directed at all. Some of his early scenes after the electrical surge are painfully thrown away and once again my wishful thinking drifted to Buster Keaton; just imagine what tremendous gag-pulsing value he would have got from the sight of a magnetized man. A comedy without one foot on the ground is no more than a flight of fancy as directionless as a balloon; the master clowns of silent cinema knew that and so does Mr. Fletcher the gravid elder statesman of this film. As he says to Mike and Jerry ""I appreciate your creativity but lets be realistic for a second."" Be kind. Erase.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

Do we have to wait till November for Hollywood to unveil the niche prestige items that it saves for Oscar consideration? Is every movie till then doomed to be aimed at the all-important 8-year-old-girl-to-14-year-old-boy demographic? Actually there are a couple of terrific films out there there if you live in New York City Los Angeles or San Francisco. You lucky folks can catch 4 Months 3 Weeks and 2 Days the Romanian abortion drama and The Bands Visit a drily delightful comedy about an Egyptian military orchestra stranded in an Israeli desert town. If you reader are stranded in a city not playing these fine movies youre obliged to see one of the films opening in several thousand theaters and to play a guessing game based on name recognition and advertising. Jumper pits two veteran Jedi knights -- Hayden Christensen aka young Darth Vader and Samuel L. Jackson aka the black guy who didnt have enough to do in that Star Wars trilogy -- against each other in a world-hopping fantasy from director Doug Liman. Its about a teen David who falls into an ice hole and on emerging discovers he has the ability to teleport himself instantly anywhere. He uses this gift to rob banks and live the impossibly good life hanging from the minute hand of Big Ben in London snacking atop the Sphinx in Egypt slipping into the Coliseum after visiting hours then back to his posh Manhattan pad before midnight. A few years into his transformation David learns that his power comes with a price hes stuck in a war between other teleporters (including Billy Elliots Jamie Bell) and their pursuers (mainly Jackson). In this battle of the amoral and the fanatical theres little rooting interest. In fact Jumper is so lame -- undernourished in its characterizations stillborn in its action scenes -- that it inevitably leads the idled mind to wondering how this movie got past the pitch stage. Perhaps Liman was the key. He graduated from Swingers and Go two of the sauciest comedies of the 90s to the high-octane The Bourne Identity which made Matt Damon an action star and Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith which brought Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie together with seismic repercussions. So Im tempted to give Liman a pass here -- except that Jumper is so freakin awful. Christensen is a leaden slab whose charisma deprivation made me long for David to be teleported back to his high-school years when he was played by the much more attractive Max Thieriot. The only kind words I can muster are for Diane Lane as Davids mother not that she has much to do in the movie but that after a stint looking soaked and bedraggled in Untraceable shes back to being beautiful again. The eight-year-olds catch a break this weekend. The movie made for them The Spiderwick Chronicles is a decent entertainment -- not up there with the Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings sagas but a notch above The Golden Compass and Narnia. The five-novel series on which its based is sort of Narnia-lite. The childrens passage to fantasyland is a steamer trunk instead of a wardrobe but the enchanted garden has similar pleasures and threats. Moving with his family into an old dark house troubled preteen Jared (Freddie Highmore of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) finds a land of fairies and monsters. Into this otherworld he drags his twin brother Simon (also Highmore) and older skeptical sister Mallory (Sarah Bolger such a sweetheart in In America). Like most heroes of boy fiction Jared can be trusted to disobey whatever solemn order he is given by the house-and-garden forces -- such as ""Dont take the book away"" -- but if he wasnt such a stubborn cuss the movie wouldnt be able to display the rush of amazing creatures after him. Some of these may give a scary jolt to the very young; the film mixes lots of horror-movie tremors into its kid-movie sentiment. But its a pleasing melange under the direction of Mark Waters who after Freaky Friday and Mean Girls is becoming the go-to auteur of traumatized youth. Sentiment finally comes to the fore at the end with one of the dearest death scenes youre likely to see in a movie for any age group. It makes Spiderwick a film worth creeping toward. There. That should keep the kids occupied till Iron Man and Indiana Jones knock down the multiplex doors in May.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor February 15 2008 Save for later Saved Trapped Hayden Christensen and Rachel Bilson star in Jumper. Michael Gibson/Twentieth century fox          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Ill say this much for ""Jumper"" - its got a great premise. Or at least the beginnings of a premise. Its about a young man David Rice (Hayden Christensen) who has the ability to instantly teleport himself anywhere in the world he can imagine. Believe me many is the time I have wished for this gift while enduring a bad movie.I didnt exactly want to be teleported out of the theater where I saw ""Jumper"" but only because it kept threatening to become interesting. Based on a young adult novel by Steven Gould and directed by Doug Liman (""Mr. And Mrs. Smith"") it cant quite make up its mind whether to be a boys book fantasy or a roiling psychological drama with neat special effects. Liman and his screenwriters dont want to be accused of making just another CGI spectacular but the seriousness that they offer up seems misplaced. David is self-absorbed without having much of a self to absorb.Raised by a belligerent father (Michael Rooker) after his mother (Diane Lane) left him at age 5 David discovers in high school that he has the ability to zip anywhere he pleases. (Its a nice touch that his first official act is robbing a bank.) Pretty soon hes living in a New York penthouse - one of those cold soulless aeries that filmmakers haul out whenever they want to instruct us that money isnt everything. An average day for David is lunch atop the Sphinx in Egypt dinner in Paris dessert in Tokyo. Imagine the time this guy saves avoiding airport security. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? But all is not well in Jumperville. It turns out Jumpers are a very rare breed who have been hunted from the beginnings of time by the Paladins a secret society dedicated to their elimination. Samuel L. Jackson plays Roland the head Paladin and you couldnt ask for much more in the way of molten stares. With his carefully sheared hair dyed lambs-wool white Jackson cuts an imposing figure. He and Christensen acted together in the ""Star Wars"" series and that film along with ""The Matrix"" is halfheartedly referenced here. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Jumper takes a leap of logic Actually the true scene stealer is Jamie Bell best known for ""Billy Elliott"" who plays the rebel Jumper Griffin whose parents were killed by Roland. Griffin is such a herky-jerky punk that it makes sense hes never in one place for long. Hes ravaged by his gifts. David meanwhile never seems terribly put out by the whole thing even when hes contorting himself through worm holes in the space fabric while also trying to explain all this to his moony main squeeze (Rachel Bilson).""Jumper"" has so many loose ends that it almost cries out for a sequel. This of course is intentional. I would say the filmmakers are being a tad optimistic. Grade C+ Rated PG-13 for sequences of intense action violence some language and brief sexuality.

Comments Jumper Hayden Christensen stars as a fellow who can instantly transport himself anywhere in the world which allows him to stand atop the Great Sphinx or grab the TV remote without getting up. The problem is that after a few reels those two actions begin to feel equivalent; like so many other CGI behemoths this dull action fantasy ultimately squashes rather than inspires ones sense of wonder. Michael Rooker Diane Lane and Samuel L. Jackson add some color in supporting roles but theyre no match for the annihilating beige of Christensens screen persona.

"Jumper Who told Hayden Christensen he could act? - Mercury News Hot Topics Big Sur fire Balloon crash No-parachute skydive Deadline 29 to Vegas Sheryl Sandbergs Option B Steve Torrence Ask Amy Comics SV150 Print Email Font ResizeJumper Who told Hayden Christensen he could act?By Bruce NewmanMercury NewsPosted 02/13/2008 070117 PM PSTUpdated 03/05/2008 110000 PM PSTClick photo to enlargeIn ""Jumper"" Hayden Christensen and Rachel Bilson are trapped by Paladins a sect sworn to destroy jumpers.<<1>> In ""Jumper"" the time-space continuum is no match for Hayden Christensen who plays David Rice an ordinary boy in Michigan who one day discovers that he can teleport himself across a room or to the other side of the world in the blink of an eye. He and others like him ""jump"" through wormholes pulling objects such as a Mercedes-Benz a double-decker bus and even part of a building through the hole with them. In fact the only force on Earth so dense that it apparently cant be moved even by the movies special effects is Christensens wooden acting. After bringing the second ""Star Wars"" trilogy to its knees as the inert Anakin Skywalker his performance here threatens the very fabric of time and space. With all its sudden shape-shifting its not surprising that the story creates a constant sense of dislocation thats disruptive to the narrative. But as he demonstrated in his last picture ""Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith"" director Doug Liman is adept at a kind of hyper-realism in which heroes may have fantastic skills but they arent necessarily all that heroic. Mr. and Mrs. Smith for instance were top-notch assassins and in ""Jumper"" David Rice is a bank robber. The movie is at some pains to show off the limitless possibility of Davids life and so we follow him through an evening out as he jumps from New York to a London nightclub followed by big-wave surfing in Fiji and then on to lunch atop the head of the Great Sphinx.Advertisement From a similarly masterful promontory he reminds us in the long narration that opens the film that once he was ""a normal person a chump just like you."" Awww go on. Davids life resembles a video game and so does the movie. His super-power is the equivalent of hitting the ESC key on a computer and thats what he does over and over again. As a character David seems less interested in propelling himself forward than fleeing the scene and while this impulse to scram worked for ""The Fugitive"" its less attractive on him. His nemesis is a reverse on the usual albino bad guy a black cat with white fur named Roland played by Samuel L. Jackson. ""I hate jumpers"" Roland says before teleporting one of them straight to hell with a sword. Hes the leader of a group known as Paladins who ""have been killing jumpers . . . since medieval times."" Roland represents some malign form of religious fundamentalism declaring that ""only God"" should have the power to do what jumpers can do. But this murderous incantation doesnt adequately explain the enmity between Paladins and jumpers and were expected to simply accept as a given that anybody whos constantly running away must have something to run away from. One of the least satisfying aspects of ""Jumper"" is Davids insistence on keeping his powers a secret from Millie (Rachel Bilson) the girl hes adored since they were kids. Bilson whose eyes are brown with pupils the size of half-dollars attempts to bring some heat to her exchanges with Christensen but you cant light a fire when the wood is all wet.

Jackson (l.) and Hayden Christensen Tuesday June 3 2008 1128 AM Jumper. Sci-fi chase flick in which people who can teleport themselves are being tracked by people out to kill them. With Hayden Christensen Samuel L. Jackson Rachel Bilson. Director Doug Liman (128). PG-13 Action violence. At area theaters.Deep into Hollywoods Dumb Season comes one of its dumbest offerings Doug Limans ""Jumper"" a chase film about a breed of half-people/half-ghosts and a rival breed of half and halfs out to kill them. Given its uninvolving story uninteresting characters and the presence of half-man/half-tree Hayden Christensen the movie is wholly dependent on special effects which I rate only so-so. Christensen plays David Rice a young man just discovering his gift of teleportation. He can instantly ""jump"" from one place to another - from a few feet to halfway around the world - and go through the densest matter as if it werent there. David uses his gift to steal a few million bucks from bank vaults and has the confidence to take on any bully. Take a swing at him and hell float like a butterfly and sting like a bee. What David is about to learn is that hes just one of many Jumpers whove been tele-roaming the earth for centuries and that he has a mortal enemy in a man named Roland (Samuel L. Jackson with snow-white hair). Roland is a Paladin and carries with him a suitcase-size electronic gizmo that creates wormholes through which he can track Jumpers. The unsuspecting David is on holiday in Rome with Millie (Rachel Bilson) a childhood pal that he has just promoted to girlfriend when he finds himself being chased from the ruins of the Colosseum to the peaks of the Pyramids to the dunes of the Sahara and back to Millies apartment in Michigan. Along the way he enters a tentative partnership with Griffin (Jamie Bell) another Jumper who has devoted his life to killing Paladins. And off they go leaping around the world like fleas on a hairless dog with Roland in hot pursuit and the special effects cranked up to full volume. Not much for the girls to do here. Millie is in a state a perpetual confusion repeating the line ""David tell me whats going on"" And the only mystery about Davids mysterious mom is why Diane Lane is playing her. Didnt she just get an Oscar nomination for something? jmathewsnydailynews.com Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Hayden Christensen is at his most wooden since the ""Star Wars"" movies as David a Wisconsin teenager who discovers his gift when a fall into an icy pond suddenly lands him straight in the local library. Straightaway he flees to the Big Apple where he teleports himself in and out of bank vaults with millions of dollars. How hes able to buy a huge Manhattan apartment entirely with cash is the first of many unexplained mysteries. Its eight years later and Samuel L. Jackson shows up with strange white hair claiming to be a representative of a federal agency. His character Roland actually belongs to the Paladins a quasi-religious group devoted to wiping out those who share Davids teleportation powers the Jumpers. The Paladins were responsible for the Inquisition and the Salem witch trials David is informed by another Jumper named Griffin (Jamie Bell of ""Billy Elliot"" who is considerably more animated than Christensen). Oh. By this point David has inexplicably fled home to Michigan - where NY1 is mysteriously playing continuously on his dads TV - and suddenly remembered that hes in love with Millie (Rachel Bilson). David takes Millie on an airplane to Rome - somehow his buying a ticket with cash goes unnoticed by the TSA - where they tour the Colosseum and meet up with Griffin and a band of Paladins who are apparently on 24-hour alert around the world. This is where the movie which seems to be making up the rules of teleportation as it goes along totally lost me. The rest is essentially a badly edited hourlong chase sequence with some of the cheesiest special effects seen in a major studio release of late. Even funnier is Jackson in major paycheck mode trying to stop David from teleporting by using what looks like aerosol spray and a room dehumidifier - and dodging a CGIs London double-decker bus that Griffin has ""jumped"" at him. Diane Lane who apparently also needed the gig pops up from time to time as Davids mom. At the totally baffling climax to ""Jumper"" he asks her ""What now then?"" Excellent question. JUMPERWhere do we go from here?Running time 88 minutes. Rated PG-13 (intense action violence mild profanity and sexuality). At the 19th St. East the Battery Park City the First and 62nd others.

But there is lightning-paced and then there is warp speed. Doug Limans Jumper is the latter a not-so-good quality in an action/adventure for the simple reason that the audience cant figure out whats going on. Adapted from Steven Goulds young-adult novel Limans tale of the bookish high-schooler with unusual powers isnt a shot of adrenaline its an OD. Mercilessly bullied at school and harshly treated by his single dad at home David Rice dreams of escape. To his amazement - and initially ours - he finds that he has powers of teleportation and can elude his abusers. The first time it happens he lands in the stacks of the public library. The second time it happens he lands in his bedroom. When David is in conflict he visualizes a safe place and - whoosh - hes there. Soon David is using this gift for his own material benefit. He beams himself into a bank vault beaming out with sufficient Benjamins to live like a boy billionaire a hyperspace cadet unrestricted by the space/time continuum. David can surf in the Maldives by morning party in London by night and take a break in between at the Great Pyramids. Liman filmmaker of The Bourne Identity and Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith has made a teen mashup of his globe-galloping hits. But it lacks a character backstory as compelling as Jason Bournes or stars with the charisma of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Jumper stars Hayden Christensen (bland as Anakin Skywalker in Star Wars piquant as Stephen Glass in Shattered Glass) as David. Because his conflicts are so generically detailed (is Dad abusive because Mom abandoned the family?) we never get a handle on whats eating David Rice. Nor does Christensen teamed here with O.C. cutie Rachel Bilson have the magnetism to draw us in. His David projects a sense of entitlement that makes him instantly dislikable. Here is someone with superpowers watching news reports of flood and fire casualties who are ripe for saving yet he does nothing. If Christensen underplays his role the usually reliable Samuel L. Jackson - who evidently has stolen Uncle Bens hair - overplays the antagonist with such fervor that Hormel should glaze him and can him. The quality of their performances wouldnt matter if there were a narrative thread for the audience to grab onto. But for Liman it seems velocity is what matters.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com. Read her blog ""Flickgrrl"" at http//go.philly.com/flickgrrl/.

"Doug Limans Jumper reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Doug Limans Jumper reviewed. Doug Limans Jumper reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Feb. 14 2008 452 PM Super Frat Boy Hayden Christensen in Jumper. By Dana Stevens Hayden Christensen in Jumper Hayden Christensen is an actor of precisely one affect a petulant boyish entitlement so impregnable it borders on malevolence. He may never find a role more suited to his gift than that of Stephen Glass the boy-wonder fabulist of Shattered Glass (or as I like to think of it Saw for journalists).  As the young Anakin Skywalker in the Star Wars films Christensen got the teenage torment part right but he never seemed substantial enough to grow into a dictator as potent as Darth Vader and his love scenes with Natalie Portman were risibly spark-free. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. In Jumper (20th Century Fox) directed by Doug Liman (Swingers The Bourne Identity Mr. and Mrs. Smith) Christensens bratty indolence should have been a plus. After all as the teleporting twentysomething David Rice hes sort of the ultimate trust-fund kid. Not because he comes from money--his dad (Michael Rooker) is an abusive bum and his mother (Diane Lane) abandoned him when he was 5. But David has infinitely deep pockets and a jet-setting lifestyle thanks to his inborn ability to ""jump"" instantaneously from one place to another from Tokyo to Cairo to Rome; from inside a bank vault to outside it contents in hand; or if hes feeling lazy just to the other side of a door. Take that doorknob In the words of Roland (Samuel L. Jackson) Davids mysterious white-maned gray-turtle-necked nemesis jumpers live life ""with all the boring parts cut out."" That would definitely rule out this movie. Advertisement Jumper never contends with its biggest liability the fact that its main character is neither a lovable rascal nor a fascinatingly dark antihero but just kind of a smug tool. Hes a wormhole-hopping frat boy who treats the globe as his own private Fort Lauderdale. After snagging some gnarly waves in Fiji and a Polish chicks phone number he zips off for a solo lunch atop the Sphinxs head. One day he decides to head back to his hometown and look up a childhood flame Millie (Rachel Bilson). Millies always wanted to visit Rome so David takes her there (old-school style on a plane to hide his special powers). But his idiotic insistence on dragging her into the Coliseum after closing time brings them face to face with a vagabond British jumper Griffin (Jamie Bell) who warns David that the Paladins sworn enemies of jumpers everywhere are hot on his trail. How has David gotten through years of blissful jumping with no notion that the Paladins (or for that matter other jumpers) even exist? Why do jumpers themselves exist? How many are there and how long have they been around? Whence the rift between them and the Paladins (whose vaguely medieval name suggests a grudge of historical standing)? Ask away my friends and ye shall ask in vain. Jumpers script based on a young-adult sci-fi novel by Steven Gould is less blameworthy for its incoherence than for its incuriosity. Isnt the whole point of movies like this to establish a consistent if completely absurd cosmology and then have fun playing with its logic and lingo? Jumper not only makes the rules up as it goes along; it neglects to tell us what those rules are which is both unfair and unfun. At moments the movie seems to be aspiring to camp as when Samuel L. Jacksons character preparing for an extraserious jump spritzes a room with some mysterious substance in an aerosol can (E-Z Jump? Rules-of-Time-and-Space-B-Gone?). Only Sam Jackson could spray in a way that makes you think man thats some badassed spraying. Unfortunately Jumper isnt Snakes on a Plane and Liman squanders Jacksons gift for tongue-in-cheek action (in addition to humiliating him with a dreadful character wig). Jumper is like the bleary morning-after hangover of Limans early work. Swingers and Go trifling though they were made the pleasure of being an indestructible young person palpable and powerful. Jumper shares those movies emphasis on youth culture exotic locations and constant restless kinesis. Yet it feels hollow sickly and inert. Those were movies about amoral jerks with pitiable aspirations toward a materialistically imagined ""good life."" So is Jumper; but it also feels depressingly like a movie by one.

"Jumper Doesnt Get Much Liftoff washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On >> This StoryRead +|Watch +| Comments Movies Jumper Doesnt Get Much Liftoff Hayden Christensen gets around -- but goes nowhere -- in the role of a young man with teleportation powers who finds himself in a strange centuries-long war in the sci-fi fantasy. (Twentieth Century Fox) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Thursday February 14 2008 Continuity has always been a bugaboo for Hollywood the necessity for things to make sense and follow some kind of narrative logic a demand that presents screenwriters with all manner of headaches hair-tearing and plot-hole-induced dementia. ""Jumper"" dispenses with the pesky notion altogether engaging in geographic non sequiturs with giddy promiscuity sending its main character from New York to London to Giza to Tokyo in the blink of an eye and plopping him into twists turns and sudden developments with equally arbitrary abandon. This StoryMovies Jumper Doesnt Get Much LiftoffAn Interview With Hayden ChristensenTrailer JumperFind Jumper ShowtimesView All Items in This StoryView Only Top Items in This Story So if anything ""Jumper"" should be a lot of fun to watch unchained as it is from the usual rules of the game. But the science-fiction fantasy in which Hayden Christensen somnambulates through the role of a young man with genetic teleporting powers is oddly inert. Aside from bouncing viewers through a veritable Fodors guide of 1000 places they should see before they die ""Jumper"" suffers from long talky sequences and a shocking lack of visual imagination. The chief special effect wherein Christensen disappears and reappears to the accompaniment of a whooshing sonic thump is a big yawn having already been perfected for the ages by Ray Walston in the 1960s sitcom ""My Favorite Martian."" Its that rare genre picture targeted to teens and young adults that suffers from underkill. Part of the problem is Christensen whose breakout role was playing the young Anakin Skywalker in the recent execrable ""Star Wars"" installments and who has never managed to project anything but a sullen air of lazy entitlement. That persona actually fits his character David Rice who in ""Jumper"" uses his teleporting powers for everything from robbing banks to scooting down the couch to grab the remote. Hes a spoiled petulant creep so when hes visited by a mysterious stranger named Roland who proceeds to beat the stuffing out of him its difficult to know whom to root for. Roland by the way is played by Samuel L. Jackson in a performance that considered in tandem with ""Snakes on a Plane"" seems designed to dissuade audiences from ever taking him seriously again. Stalking through ""Jumper"" with his hair dyed an unearthly shade of white he snarls and shouts variously claiming to work for the NSA the CIA and the IRS (presumably saving the most terrifying cover story for last). Roland is actually a soldier in a centuries-long war between Jumpers and Paladins the latter of whom insist that omnipotence should be the purview of the Big Teleporter Upstairs. ""Jumper"" which was directed by Doug Liman and is based on the novel by Steven Gould is essentially a global chase movie. Along the way David picks up two allies in his schemes to outsmart Roland. First he meets a fellow Jumper a cheeky Brit named Griffin (Jamie Bell). And then he returns to his childhood home in Ann Arbor Mich. to track down his old sweetheart Millie played by Rachel Bilson in a performance as vapid as Christensens is tepid. Wispy-voiced devoid of humor or libidinal zing physically un-commanding these two bring to mind Gloria Swanson in ""Sunset Boulevard"" when she laments ""We had faces then."" Now faces are all we have left as a generation of attractive blank slates engage in a numbing game of the bland leading the bland. The big set piece of ""Jumper"" is a climactic chase scene that takes David from Giza to Times Square to Chechnya and beyond. It should be a way-cool kick in the pants but Liman -- who made his name directing such hyper-caffeinated films as ""Go"" and ""The Bourne Identity"" -- dispenses with even the most visceral pleasures of pulp rendering ""Jumper"" oddly lifeless. Strange as it sounds this is a movie that fails not for lack of substance but for lack of style. Jumper (88 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for sequences of intense action violence some profanity and brief sexuality. >> This StoryRead +|Watch +| Comments (c) 2008 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends Activity View More Activity  Jumper Doesnt Get Much Liftoff An Interview With Hayden Christensen Find Jumper Showtimes Trailer Jumper",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/13/AR2008021303166.html,200,jumper14,jumper,washingtonpost
"Jumper Lacks bounce | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesJumper Lacks bounce Logic takes the greatest leap in Jumper  a sci-fi thriller that plays like a frog jacked on steroids.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Feb. 14 2008 Starring Hayden Christensen Jamie Bell Rachel Bilson Samuel L. Jackson Michael Rooker and Diane Lane. Directed by Doug Liman. 88 minutes. At major theatres. PG  Logic takes the greatest leap in Jumper a sci-fi thriller that plays like a frog jacked on steroids.Article Continued BelowThe film leaps from one exotic location to another around the world with even time for a stop in Toronto where parts of it were filmed.The hopscotching matches the wildly disjointed screenplay which is credited to three writers working from the teen-read novel by Steven Gould. Its obvious they didnt spend much time pounding the keys attempting to create a cohesive plot or distinctive dialogue because both are MIA. The film is hardly a stretch for director Doug Liman who has shown a knack for frantic action in such past works as Mr. and Mrs. Smith The Bourne Identity and the under-appreciated Go. But neither is it something hell want at the top of his resume. Jumper is easily his least impressive work to date.Torontos Hayden Christensen is David Rice who discovers a supernatural ability to beam himself around the world without asking Scotty to warm up the transporter tube. He checks out the pyramids in Egypt and the Colisseum in Rome as casually as one might stroll the neighbourhood. Its fun for David and a great way to meet chicks - he impresses his childhood flame Millie (Rachel Bilson) this way. He can also hang out and leap around with fellow jumper Griffin (Jamie Bell from Billy Elliot) who is both an ally and a dangerous troublemaker.The sport isnt without its risks.A shadowy figure Roland played by Christensens fellow Star Wars alumnus Samuel L. Jackson is out gunning for jumpers. Roland is a paladin (he might have been called a ""blade runner"" in another sci-fi movie) leader of a violent religious cult determined to eliminate jumpers because theyre ""an abomination"" before God (shades of X-Men).The movie is something of an abomination in narrative terms. But it does have its moments even if the jumping trick gets a bit stale.Jumper may prove a good 88-minute diversion for the PlayStation and Wii set to help them leap out of the basement for some much-needed change of scenery.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint With great power comes no responsibility in the high-concept science fiction adventure ""Jumper"" about a young man with the ability to teleport wherever he wishes. David (Hayden Christensen) discovers his talent for intercontinental parkour at 15 leaves small-town Ann Arbor Mich. for Manhattan and lives the high life making withdrawals from the citys sturdiest bank vaults. In young adulthood living in a cool bachelor apartment that looks like a showroom for Toys for Multimillionaires he watches a live news report on stranded flood victims who could be saved only by ""a miracle."" And -- he does nothing. With an insouciant shrug he goes about his business setting off for a round-the-world tour of beaches and singles bars that will have him back in his cozy bed by nightfall. Big Ben Romes Coliseum and the Great Sphinx of Giza are seldom so slickly and appreciatively photographed. Its a testament to Christensens amiability that we dont dislike David. You might feel guilty for laughing at his caddish complacency but you probably will laugh nonetheless. How many of us given unlimited powers would make it our business to alleviate human suffering? George Clooney maybe. Davids immaturity seems a natural byproduct of his ability to do whatever he wants and get off scot free. ""Jumper"" which soon upshifts into over-the-top chase and action scenes is gorgeous pop art on a grand scale but its also a painless morality tale about taking responsibility treating women as individuals and growing up. Maturity is thrust upon David when a mysterious cabal of assassins called ""paladins"" track him down. He is not unique in the world explains Griffin (Jamie Bell) who arrives out of thin air to rescue him but doesnt intend to make a habit of it. As Griffin details paladins snare ""jumpers"" in electrified nets that disable them then gut them alive because ""only God should have such powers."" These killers are more than willing to kill anyone their targets hold dear. And because a hop back to Ann Arbor has rekindled Davids feelings for his home girl Millie (Rachel Bilson) he finally has something in his life worth fighting for. And what battles they are David tangles with the paladins ferocious leader (Samuel L. Jackson) in hyperactive brawls that turn the screen into a pinball table where the ball is hitting everything lighting up buzzing clanging ka-chinging. Doug Liman (""Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith"" ""The Bourne Ultimatum"") directs in deliriously dynamic punk-rock style. A punch thrown in Tokyo could knock an opponent into the Sahara; every showdown becomes a maelstrom of shifting locales and sly visual surprises. Liman is in on the joke of superhero movies; the overkill here is laced with dark ironic humor a knowing wink to the audience that says ""You aint seen nothin yet."" Griffin has a moment involving a red London double-decker bus that must be seen to be disbelieved. JUMPER  out of 4 stars The setup A young man (Hayden Christensen) discovers that his ability to teleport anywhere instantly comes with some disadvantages -- for one an army of assassins after his head. What works Mind-boggling action scenes and breathtakingly gorgeous locations. What doesnt Dont hold your breath for the farfetched plot to make sense. Great scene Any of the brawls that tumble across seven continents in the space of seven punches. Rating PG-13 for sequences of intense action violence language and brief sexuality. The films mythology is very lightly sketched. Were left to surmise for ourselves how this teleportation gimmick works and how the paladins operate. The battle is no deeper than a scrimmage between shirts and skins and burdening ""Jumper"" with expository details would only have slowed down its careening momentum. This is a movie about young romance sightseeing and blowing things up not necessarily in that order. Despite plot holes big enough to jump through (so to speak) its a thoroughly satisfying mash-up of action-mad spy thriller and sci-fi blockbuster. Its positioned as the first installment of a trilogy and if Christensen follows through on the characters promise of greater charisma and depth Ill willingly line up for the next two.

Hayden Christensen hides from the deadly Paladins a secret sect sworn to destroy the Jumpers. Photo 20th Century Fox Jumper 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Jumper asks this irresistible question What if you could spontaneously zap-zip to any location anywhere in the world - just by visualizing it? You could surf in Fiji snarf lunch on the Sphinx or survey humanity like one of those overcoated angels in Wings of Desire from your magisterial standpoint on the face of Big Ben. Then you could zap-zip into a nearby pub and insert yourself zippety-do-da between some extraneous Londoner and a so-hot blonde. When the sex is over just zap-zip outta there travelin man. Dont look back. Dont bother using your power for good. And if you need more cash why zap-zip in and out of any handy bank vault. Such is the modus operandi of David Rice (Hayden Christensen last seen gallivanting out-of-body in Awake) a smug 23-year-old from Anne Arbor Mich. who uses his peripatetic gift to woo chicks and live the high life until Samuel L. Jackson shows up promising to blow it all hell. See David is a ""Jumper and Jackson (called Roland here but come on) is a ""Paladin and Jumpers and Paladins have hated each others guts since Medieval times. So Roland is bent on killing David Davids father (Michael Rooker) Davids non-Jumper girlfriend Millie (Rachel Bilson) and any auxiliary Jumpers he comes across including an edgy little hairball named Griffin (Jamie Bell) who zap-zips in from his desert lair. There are scenes in Rome and Tokyo and Manhattan and Egypt and wherever else their fancies take them giving the film a computer-burnished globe-trotting hedonism that makes a fine visual gimmick for a while. But thats just it a gimmick. Once the novelty wears off were left with a hack screenplay and a host of nagging questions. Such as Who are these Paladins? Where do they get off torturing people with cattle prods? Who sprayed that white paint on Samuel L. Jacksons head and is a matte or gloss finish? As for David how does he maintain his slim frame with all that zap-zipping from kitchen counter to fridge which is frankly more exercise than some of us get all week? Whats more director Doug Liman (who made the less-nonsensical Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith and The Bourne Identity) and his band of screenwriters (working from the novel by Steven Gould) never explain why and how these Jumpers jump. We hear about wormholes once or twice; we hear a nifty phhwooosh as Jumpers blip from place to place; and the movies publicity refers to a genetic anomaly not unlike webbed feet. Griffin says he first jumped at age 5 and Davids Mom (Diane Lane) reports the same but David himself wasnt aware of his superpower until the afternoon he almost drowned and emerged sopping wet between the stacks in a nearby library. No librarians took note of his arrival. Which brings up one last nit to pick When David crash-lands he often pulverizes the infrastructure. Beams collapse tiles crunch plaster flakes. Only at the Roman Coliseum do emergency workers respond in force - otherwise the rest of humanity walks around in a dorky haze. At one point David and Millie materialize in a heap in a busy emergency room smashing a sizeable depression into the floor. Hospital workers flock to their aid which is nice of them of course but no one blinks at a) the damage or b) the fact that teleporting freaks have just beamed directly into the E.R. Its a paradox but science fiction has to make sense It can rest on the worlds most outlandish premise (e.g. our earthly existence is a mass hallucination enforced by evil machines) but only if its internal logic holds up to scrutiny. And Jumper cant make that leap. amy.biancollichron.com .com Todays Deals Titanium Drill Bit 115-Piece Set for 30 + pickup at Home Depot GameStop Summer Sale Keter Manor 4x6-Foot Storage Shed for 339 + pickup at Walmart Best Buy Clearance amp; Open-Box items Up to 50% off + free...

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post ""Jumper"" begins with a cocky voice-over. David Rice (Hayden Christensen) our protagonist -- hero may prove too hopeful a word -- challenges audiences with a bit of self-knowledge. ""Once"" he says ""I was a chump like you."" OK you think watching this diverting sci-fi thriller hes full of himself. Thatll change. Only as this tale about a young man discovering he can teleport himself unfurls his attitude doesnt gain perspective nearly enough. His ego trips land him in a bank vault send him from New York City to Tokyo -- and in a show of true ambition (or plain silly FX) from a sidewalk into a Mercedes convertible. The note of contempt lasts long enough to pose this query Whose contempt exactly? Davids or the filmmakers? Talented director Doug Liman has made a fast and furiously edited movie that seems bent on leaping like David from the demands of the moment to another place. ""Jumper"" skips emotional traction (or humor) in what feels like a rush to the inevitable sequel or two. Limans pacing seems to prove the movies point that a guy with unusual gifts can misuse them (even be stunted by them). So lets slow down. The ""chump"" David once was is a shy high-schooler smitten by a sweet girl named Millie and bullied by a jerk named Mark. After a brutish exchange David walks onto the fragile ice of a river to retrieve a gift. Instead of drowning after breaking through he finds himself miraculously elsewhere. Later when his father an afternoon drinker still furious at being abandoned by his wife (Diane Lane in a hurried cameo) bursts through his bedroom door David lands once again on the floor of the Ann Arbor public library. Theres a lot of bullying in this movie from bonehead Mark to Davids Dad (Michael Rooker) to Samuel L. Jackson. Wearing his hair dyed white Jackson plays a highly effective Jumper slayer or Paladin whose centuries-old motto might be ""I have had it with these % jumpers on this % planet"" Liman the director of adrenalized rides ""Go"" and ""The Bourne Identity"" had help making ""Jumper"" narratively jittery. Steven Goulds novel was adapted by three screenwriters with impressive super- hero cred David S. Goyer Jim Uhls and Simon Kinberg. And the filmmakers seem aware of Davids failings. On a TV set we glimpse flood victims scrambling to survive raging waters. David grabs an umbrella and heads out. But youd have to be a chump to imagine heroism where narcissism rules they seem to tell us. In the end the script short-shrifts Davids transformation. He clocks an awful lot of wormhole time just to go from selfish to mildly less so. When did getting the girl (Rachel Bilson does an aware turn as older Millie) and amassing much coin become the only ambitions of the American superhero? Clearly the burden of being a Jumper is a heavy one. In a less dour film Jamie Bells fellow jumper Griffin would provide comic relief. Of course Davids barbed and sulky moods are the armor of an emotionally wounded soul. And Christensens sad-eyed glances speak of need. But there comes a time when you want the guy to grow up. If not that at least lighten up. Or what the heck save a stranger.

Jackson Jamie Bell; Director Doug Liman; Author David S. Goyer Simon Kinberg Jim Uhls; Release Date Wide 02/14/2008; Runtime (in minutes) 88; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor 20th Century Fox Film Corporation Posted February 13 2008 -- 1200 AM EST In Jumper Hayden Christensen more suavely chiseled than weve seen him before his heavy brows and dark eyes narrowed to laser focus plays David Rice who discovers that he can teleport himself to any spot on the globe. As he passes through wormholes or something in the space-time continuum (though thats more of an explanation than the movie provides) he leaps at the commanding snap of his mind from his dads working-class house in Ann Arbor Mich. to the clock face at the top of Big Ben or onto the head of the Sphinx for an impromptu picnic -- sort of like what Elizabeth Montgomery used to do on Bewitched. He also isnt above popping himself over to the refrigerator for a beer or into a banks security vault to make off with mounds of cash which is awfully convenient since it allows him to live the life he chooses complete with sleekly sprawling apartments in half a dozen cities. If David did all this while wearing a skintight jumpsuit with a big lavender J emblazoned on his chest we could probably call Jumper the lamest superhero movie of the year and leave it at that. But David isnt trying to save the world; hes simply a guy on the move -- an amoral globetrotter flashing through space on his whims. The director Doug Liman once made a thrilling gem of a movie about testy twentysomethings who couldnt stop moving -- it was called quite perfectly Go -- and you could say that Jumper also tries to tap the spirit of go-go youth. Except that there really isnt a whole lot to David or to anyone he meets. He takes the girl he has a crush on (Rachel Bilson) to Rome -- to hide his powers a la Clark Kent the two fly there on a plane -- but the actors dont exactly strike sparks. On a tour of the Colosseum he learns that there are other Jumpers around too but mostly hes a cipher loner bopping around in astrophysical limbo. When he crashes into downtown Tokyo its just another backdrop another hasty frequent-flier effect. For all that we care he might as well be running in place. Doug Liman is no longer the fresh storyteller he once was but the trajectory of his career tells a story of its own. He has become a one-man paradigm of whats happened to Hollywood moving from character to pure kinetics. His first film Swingers (1996) is still his best -- a classic of tangy talk of men behaving badly but doing it with chatty grace in a hilarious neo-Rat Pack style. With Go (1999) Liman kept his pinpoint sense of generational tude; when he followed that up with The Bourne Identity (2002) no one could begrudge this indie graduate the right to make a square-jawed action spectacular. But two years ago with the love-is-a-battlefield Brangelina romantic comedy Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith Liman overdosed on octane; there was something cheesy yet decadent about it as if he had decided halfway through to say to the audience ""Screw that nuance stuff You know you just want to see things blow up"" Jumper feels even more chicly jaded. Powered by faux wide-eyed spasms of technology (the blurry images and mini sonic booms that signify Davids leaps) its the first Liman film designed to do little more than goose your motor impulses. Theres no real behavior just endless movement brought off with empty crackerjack skill. Liman for all his craft doesnt have enough fun with the premise. Considering that fantasy and science fiction are now the air we breathe we can accept Davids space-tripping abilities without blinking an eye and I wish that he had something more exciting to do than stay out of the way of Roland (Samuel L. Jackson) one of a group of ""Paladins"" who are devoted to wiping out the Jumpers because in Rolands words ""Only God should have the power to be in all places at all times"" Jackson wearing a faintly absurd silver G.I. Joe buzz cut makes a Paladin sound a bit like the Bush administrations idea of a terrorist He hates the Jumpers freedom. Period. David also collides with a fellow Jumper played by Jamie Bell as a kind of scruffy British Huck Finn-meets-80s alt-rocker. Bell has a witty insouciant presence; he doesnt take any of this too seriously an attitude that looks good on his squirrelly features. Thats more than you can say for Hayden Christensen a gifted actor who tends to be at his best in films like Shattered Glass when he can dip into an undertow of anxiety and low cunning. In Jumper trying to be the coolest of skywalkers hes just a hollow contradiction a stolid man in motion.

Starring Hayden Christensen Samuel L. Jackson Jamie Bell Rachel Bilson Michael Rooker Diane Lane. Directed by Doug Liman. (PG-13. 88 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) As a travelogue ""Jumper"" isnt half bad with lots of juicy images of Rome Tokyo New York and other splendid places. But were supposed to be watching a sci-fi action film and thats where things go south. The premise is based on a universal childhood escape fantasy What if you could instantly transport yourself anywhere? Thats just what our hero David Rice (Hayden Christensen) wants to do since hes having a tough time growing up in Ann Arbor Mich. Bullied at school hes being raised by a jerky dad (Michael Rooker). His mom (Diane Lane) abandoned the family when he was 5. One bad day when the boys life is in jeopardy he discovers that he can wish himself to a safe place. Cut to the future. As a young man David is living royally in New York inhabiting a jaw-dropping apartment with all the finest gadgets - moneys no object since he can zap himself into bank vaults and take as much as he wants. On the same day he can have lunch in Egypt atop the Sphinx then transport himself say to Rome for dinner then go clubbing in London. He travels via mysterious shimmering portals and can even take things with him. Hes also selfish and smug - except when it comes to the lost love of his youth Millie (Rachel Bilson of TVs ""The O.C.""). Seeking to renew her acquaintance David finds her still in Michigan tending bar. So what could possibly go wrong? Well (and Ill try to minimize the spoilers) it turns out that David is not alone in his special powers - he encounters a roughneck young Englishman Griffin (Jamie Bell) who is also a ""jumper."" Then theres an anti-jumper fanatic Roland (Samuel L. Jackson with his hair dyed white). Circumstances force David and Griffin to become partners and Millie is caught up in a dangerous showdown. Despite their unique power the jumpers have a weakness that their enemies exploit. There are action sequences set in the Roman Colosseum because well its a great-looking place. Director Doug Liman (""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"") obviously has a taste for globe-trotting having directed ""The Bourne Identity"" and executive-produced its two sequels. Thus David winds up standing on the clock face of Big Ben in London and popping up in other memorable spots too. During the films slower moments you can always pass the time by counting the plot holes which are legion. Christensen was no doubt tapped for the role to pull in ""Star Wars"" fans - he played Anakin Skywalker in ""Episode II"" and ""Episode III"" - and this comic book material isnt much of a test of whatever talent he may possess. In fact the part was first offered to Eminem who turned it down. Christensen was a last-minute replacement for Tom Sturridge who was let go two weeks before filming was to begin. Bilson is OK Bell is fun to watch and Jackson has done this sort of role many times before. I like Rooker and Lane and wish theyd had more screen time here. The ending by the way is clearly intended to set up a sequel. Pretty optimistic if you ask me. -- Advisory Intense action violence language and some brief sexuality.

"Jumper | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; jumper ) Jumper (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli One of the cardinal rules when making a motion picture about a superhero especially one no one has heard of is not to make the integrity of the story depend on the existence of a sequel. Unfortunately thats a rule that director Doug Liman breaks. If the viewer is able to ignore the wooden performances of Hayden Christensen and Rachel Bilson whats on screen is fine and even exciting at times. But theres no resolution. Three plot threads are left dangling. Jumper feels like a 90-minute tease. Viewers are left waiting for what comes next and unless there is a follow-up (which seems unlikely) that dangling will continue for all time. The movie is surprisingly short; couldnt another 15 minutes have been spent fleshing out a few ambiguities and providing the sense of closure that is otherwise absent? Really Liman should know better. He helmed The Bourne Identity which became the first of three interlinked Bourne productions. Liman and his screenwriters approached The Bourne Identity as a stand-alone with the potential to expand. Thats not the case here. Coherence demands a second installment but theres nothing in the movies pedigree marketing or pre-box office projections that indicate it will generate enough support to demand a follow-up. As a result everyone paying 10 to see Jumper will have to do what Golden Compass fans have been forced into reading the books to see where things go next (and ignore the inevitable discontinuities between script and novel). What makes it to the screen is often fun. Liman applies the same frenetic approach to action scenes that made The Bourne Identity such an engaging and exciting affair. Theres a lot of cutting during the climactic battle sequences but that makes sense considering whats happening. And Liman limits his use of the potentially nausea inducing hand held shots to a couple of instances. Jumper is clean clear and spare lacking only a semi-satisfying ending. The films best scenes are the early ones for two reasons. First when it comes to superhero ""origin stories"" the most enjoyable parts are usually those in which the protagonist explores his or her powers. Thats where the fun and wonder lies as the hero begins to understand the pros and cons of the abilities that set him/her apart from everyone else. Second the actors playing the teenage versions of the characters are more believable and sympathetic than those who play their adult counterparts. AnnaSophia Robb (A Bridge to Terabithia) and Max Thieriot (The Astronaut Farmer) outact Bilson and Christensen by such a stretch that it sucks energy and life from the movie when they are replaced. The film opens in Ann Arbor where a socially awkward high school student David Rice (Thieriot) tries to give a token of his affection to the girl next-door of his dreams Millie (Robb). It goes disastrously wrong when a bully gets his hands on the snow globe intended for Millie and tosses it onto a river with thin ice. Attempting to retrieve it David goes under; however instead of perishing in a watery grave he spontaneously teleports into the Ann Arbor library. Allowing everyone to believe him to be dead including his abusive alcoholic father (Michael Rooker) David hones his teleportation abilities until he can travel freely almost anywhere. To get a little money he robs a bank and thats what brings him to the attention of NSA agent Roland (Samuel L. Jackson) who doesnt like ""jumpers."" Fast forward the better part of a decade. David (Christensen) is now an adult and has adapted nicely to a life of privilege and luxury. But hes lonely and returns to Ann Arbor to locate Millie (Bilson). Their reunion results in a whirlwind romance and a trip to Rome. While there Millie begins to suspect theres something strange about David and David learns hes not unique. He meets Griffin (Jamie Bell) who informs him hes in the middle of a centuries-old war between ""jumpers"" and ""paladins"" and its kill-or-be-killed. Roland it seems is a fanatic who will destroy anyone and anything that stands between him and putting a knife into a jumpers heart. The films rules for jumpers are intentionally left unclear so that the movie can play with them as the story evolves. Its not like in The Time Travelers Wife however where travelers are restricted from bringing anything including clothing with them. The concept of the war between the jumpers and the paladins is left half-explained and underexplored. I kept thinking of the hatred between werewolves and vampires in the Underworld movies. If theres a rich mythology underlying this religious struggle it never makes it to the screen. Finally theres a sense of a missed opportunity with respect to the relationship between David and Millie. The failure is both one of the screenplay which relegates Millie into the role of more a prop than a character and of the actors neither of whom is able to imbue his or her character with any real sense of humanity. Christensen has enough highlights on an uneven resume to convince me he can act but lazy performances such as this dont make him someone to watch for. I was intrigued enough by half-explored ideas and unresolved plot threads that I would watch a sequel to Jumper - not that I expect one to be produced. The concepts and premise have more promise than whats delivered to the screen but thats not a quality unique to Jumper. As long as the viewer understands that theres a lot left open-ended by the time the credits roll the movie is capable of diverting for the better part of one and one-half hours.

Jackson sports funny hair. Other than that what a movie At least the effects are kind of cool. Of all its faults Jumpers biggest is Hayden Christensen as David. We learn from the first scene that he is a ""Jumper"" - he has a genetic anomaly that allows him to teleport himself anywhere anytime. Lunch on the top of the Sphinx? Why not? All well and good. Handy skill no doubt. But David announces himself as pretty much a punk from the start in a voiceover in which he talks about ""getting digits from this Polish girl"" - her phone number for those who dont speak jerk - and introduces his history by saying he couldnt always flit about from place to place untethered that he was once ""a chump just like you."" Well. Nice to meet you too. The flashback finds a young David (Max Thieriot) trying to impress the love of his life Millie (AnnaSophia Robb in the flashbacks Rachel Bilson as a grown-up). Things go sour in a serious way which is how David discovers his jumping ability. Next thing we know he has moved away from his evidently abusive father (Michael Rooker) and is robbing banks and growing into a very rich worldly young man. Which is where Christensen resumes the role of David. Hes a happy guy albeit with the worlds shortest attention span living his unbelievable life without consequences. But as Jacksons character says there are always consequences. Trouble is its not clear what they are. Or why they are. Jackson is Roland a ""Paladin"" (in his case a Paladin with ridiculous white hair). Theyre the anti-Jumpers and how. Roland tracks Jumpers catches them and kills them. Why? ""You are an abomination"" he tells one unfortunate Jumper before gutting him. ""Only God should have the power to be all places at all times."" OK then. Glad we got that straight. And how do Paladins find Jumpers? ""They have a machine."" Of course they do Why wouldnt they? Roland is on Davids trail. So naturally David heads home to endanger everyone around him including Millie and give Roland an obvious place to look. The only thing keeping David one step ahead - granted when you can teleport they tend to be big steps - is Griffin (Jamie Bell) another Jumper who knows all about the Paladins. Griffin wants to kill Roland Roland wants to kill David - its a happy little circle really. (There also are some mommy issues floating around in there somewhere as well.) Jumper is directed by Doug Liman who also directed Swingers Go and The Bourne Identity. Hes adept at the action sequences which are by necessity huge. But hes saddled with a story that doesnt deliver and in Christensen a lead who makes you want to root for Jackson to the extent you want to root for anyone. Mostly you envy Davids powers. At least he could jump to a different theater and see a better movie. Read Goodykoontz at 602-444-8974 or bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Read his blog at goodyblog.azcentral.com.

Goyer Jim Uhls Simon Kinberg Steven GouldDIRECTED BY Doug Liman STARRING Hayden Christensen Samuel L. Jackson Diane Lane A piece of idiotic sci-fi piffle called Jumper looks like 90 billion wasted on 90 minutes of popcorn junk. Even the butter is phony. Based on a book I never intend to read this plotless confusion is about a 15-year-old Michigan high-school kid who falls through the ice and wakes up in a bank vault stealing millions by walking through the walls. Eight years later ensconced in a New York penthouse decorated by the U.S. Mint he has turned into Hayden Christensen--trying his best to outgrow his Star Wars image and failing miserably--now thoroughly assimilated in his role as a rare being who can miraculously teleport himself to any location in the world. These people are called ""jumpers"" because they jump from traffic jams in Tokyo to surfing in Hawaii before you can say ""Huh?"" One minute theyre hanging off a clock in Londons Parliament Square the next theyre breakfasting at the foot of the Sphinx and in between theres time for a stop at the Eiffel Tower and sunsets in 20 different time zones. Nobody explains why. And for reasons only the scriptwriter knows but refuses to tell nobody reveals why the jumpers are pursued by bloodthirsty maniacs called ""palladins."" Samuel L. Jackson plays the king of the palladins. He tracks stalks and kills all the jumpers. Hes the Buffy the Vampire Slayer of jumpers. Between naps I tried to think of positive things to say about jumpers. I mean think how much money you could save on plane fares. You got enemies? Just teleport them with you to--oh say someplace like downtown Baghdad--and leave them there. But the movie did me in. Mr. Christensen has only two missions to save his girlfriend back in Ann Arbor Michigan and to kill the palladins. Oops. It gets worse. For reasons even a major in logic couldnt figure out Diane Lane appears as the mother who deserted the boy when he was 5 years old. ""So Im a jumper. Youre a palladin. What now?"" he asks. ""Im giving you a head start son"" she answers. At my press screening the critics were laughing so hard that I almost missed that line. Coherence has never been a strength for director Doug Liman the hack responsible for the noxious Brangelina creep show Mr. and Mrs. Smith. He knuckle-heads himself to death here. Its not easy to film Jumper in Egypt New York Prague Ann Arbor Baja Toronto Japan the Sahara Desert and the Roman Colosseum and make it all look like Burbank.

Slick but extremely slim ""Jumper"" seemingly attempts to heed the advice of its teleporting protagonist who at one point suggests a trip to Rome that will ""skip all the boring parts."" Similarly eliding much of the exposition -- or simply delivering belches of it on the fly -- director Doug Liman churns out a serviceable sci-fi thriller/videogame template that plays like ""The Matrix Lite"" and finally isnt nearly as cool as its trailer. Nevertheless pic could engineer its own lucrative heist by zeroing in on young males itching for action during the traditional pre-Oscar malaise. After an introductory sequence in which we see a teenage version of David Rice (Max Thierot) discover his strange power to instantly leap from one location to another pic itself jumps eight years to find him enjoying the fruits of that ability. The world is almost literally his oyster as David (now played by Hayden Christensen) flits to London for a one-night stand escapes just as quickly to lunch on the pyramids and finishes the day surfing in Fiji -- all financed via the banks he robs by zapping into the vaults. OK so that blue guy in ""X-Men"" did it first its still a rather enviable talent and one that cant go unchecked for long. Enter Roland (Samuel L. Jackson underneath a shocking white mane but otherwise in a familiar mode) a driven pursuer of ""jumpers"" who deems them ""an abomination."" He is were eventually told a paladin part of a shadowy group that has been pursuing and eliminating jumpers for centuries. David picks up that useful info from another more experienced jumper Griffin (Jamie Bell the grown-up ""Billy Elliot"") but it comes a little late inasmuch as hes already jumped back to Michigan to reconnect with the dream girl from his youth Millie (Rachel Bilson) whisking her off on an improbable European tour and inadvertently putting her at risk. Having demonstrated his action chops on ""The Bourne Identity"" and ""Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith"" Liman has fun with the initial exploration of Davids skills which he shows off to Millie like a shiny new sports car. Although primarily shot in Toronto pic boasts sequences in Tokyo Egypt and Romes Colosseum and the effects team (among them ""The Matrix"" alum Joel Hynek) pretty convincingly captures the lengthy roster of exotic locales as well as images of jumpers dragging objects through their portals with them which possesses a visceral kick. Once the larger plot kicks in however the movie is a bit too chaotic for its own good and its scope feels disappointingly small. Mostly David and reluctant mentor Griffin take on what appears to be Roland and a handful of guys -- more a skirmish than the historic ""war"" to which Griffin refers. The dialogue is also consistently clunky -- a side effect perhaps of the sequential efforts of writers David S. Goyer (""Batman Begins"") Jim Uhls (""Fight Club"") and producer Simon Kinberg (Limans ""Smith"" collaborator) tackling Steven Goulds young-adult novels. Christensen exhibits a helpful vulnerability despite a thinly drawn character with every role before and since his ""Star Wars"" experience providing further evidence of how poorly served he was by those movies. Beyond that theres virtually no time to add a second dimension to anyone (Diane Lane shows up in what amounts to a cameo) with Bilsons adorableness doing most of the heavy lifting to establish a semblance of girl-in-jeopardy romance. ""Jumper"" isnt a bad time for what it is but the movie itself plays like a preview of coming attractions. Indeed given how the narrative speeds toward its tepid climax the audience might be gripped by an underlying feeling the filmmakers almost seem to have harbored as well -- a yearning to skip the preliminaries and jump ahead to a bigger better-written more satisfying sequel.
