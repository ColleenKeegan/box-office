Comments (1) click to enlarge Poltergeist 3D Video Rated PG-13  93 minutes  2015 A tight-knit family move into a new home and get terrorized by angry ghouls whose graves lie beneath the neighborhood. This perfunctory remake of the 1982 chiller has more in common with recent offerings from Bloomhouse Productions (Sinister Oculus) than with Tobe Hoopers satirical fantasy-tinged original. Screenwriter David Lindsay-Abaire updates the story turning the well-to-do Reaganites of the original into cash-stripped victims of the Great Recession; the snowy old-fashioned TV sets from which Hoopers ghosts memorably appeared are now glitchy flat-screens. Director Gil Kenan ruins the pacing with too many half-baked awkwardly staged horror set pieces but the cast acquit themselves well enough; Sam Rockwell and Rosemarie DeWitt have unique chemistry as the parents and Jared Harris is hammy fun as a grizzled ghost hunter replacing Zelda Rubinsteins quirky medium from the original.

"Poltergeist | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; poltergeist ) Poltergeist (United States 2015) May 23 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli Upon its 1982 release a single notable characteristic could be attributed to Poltergeist in an era when horror was increasingly being dominated by R-rated slasher movies it maintained a more child-friendly PG rating. (Note By todays standards that would have been a PG-13 but the PG-13 didnt exist at the time.) In part because of Steven Spielbergs involvement as writer and producer (and some might argue co-director) Poltergeist acquired a reputation that lasted through the years. It also amassed a respectable box office total despite opening on the same day as the dominant Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan and only a week before Spielbergs bigger 1982 success E.T. Theres little doubt that nostalgia played a part in Foxs decision to remake Poltergeist but thats a poor reason for any films existence and no excuse for how uninspired Gil Kenans re-imagining of this one turned out. It once again raises the ""why bother?"" question that accompanies about 95% of remakes. The new Poltergeist retains many of the beats of its predecessor. Spielbergs fear of clowns and an old tree are in evidence. The TV crackles with static and the little girl utters her classic line. But theres something missing and it becomes apparent early on. The movie isnt scary - not even a little bit. In fact things are so tame that except for a few cuss words and the grisly CGI-created undead populating the third act Poltergeist might have gotten away with the same PG rating accorded to the original. There arent even any good jump scares to wake up audiences who might have been put to sleep by the somnambulant tone. Poltergeist feels like a collage of horror movie cliches - so much so that it at times verges on parody. 33 years ago many of these werent as ingrained in our collective psyche as they are today so they felt fresh. Now however theyre tired. Weve been overexposed and Kenan fails to find a way to make them new or interesting. So we end up with a haunted house animated toys and a wise ghost expert who arrives to exorcise/clean the spirts. (The demonic ""Beast"" from the original has been deleted from the remake leaving behind a leaderless bunch of dispossessed ghouls.) The film opens with Eric Bowen (Sam Rockwell) and his family - wife Amy (Rosemarie DeWitt) son Griffin (Kyle Catlett) and daughters Kendra (Saxon Sharbino) and Madison (Kennedi Clements) - moving into a new house. Having been built on the remains of an old graveyard (something they dont know at the time) it plays host to a number of spirits who begin to do things like make clown dolls come to life and have a tree pluck Griffin out through a skylight. When Madison disappears into a magical portal in the back of her closet and calls out to them through the TV they decide its time to seek professional help. Enter Dr. Brooke Powell (Jane Adams) and her reality TV star ex-husband Carrigan Burke (Jared Harris) who diagnose the problem and offer a solution. Poltergeist works best when its not dealing with haunting material.  The early scenes setting up family dynamics are effective. Theres a nice little quasi-erotic (in a PG-13 way) scene between Eric and Amy that gets interrupted by the arrival of Griffin (whos afraid of sleeping alone in his new room). Sam Rockwell and Rosemarie DeWitt give relaxed comfortable performances especially in the early going. The stuff with the squirrel is amusing. When it comes to the supernatural goings-on the only moderately successful moment involves a drill with a life of its own. Madisons pedestrian utterance of the ""Theyre here"" line is disappointing to say the least. I know Kennedi Clements is young but one would have thought Kenan could have coaxed something a little more passionate from her. Its hard to determine who the intended audience is. The movie seems to have been made without much thought given to a target demographic. Older viewers with memories of the original will be disinclined to see something that comes across as a faded copy of long-ago favorite. Younger viewers weaned on jump scares and in-your-face camerawork will find this to be a plodding regurgitation of familiar tropes and situations. In short it will be hard to find someone who appreciates this Poltergeist on its own merits - primarily because theres so little about it worth appreciating.

The cast is wonderful. Sam Rockwell and Rosemarie DeWitt are the perfect married couple while Jared Harris is a scream as an Irish ghost hunter. And Kennedi Clements is aces in the role first assayed in 1982 by Heather ORourke as the little girl taken by ghosts into a parallel universe from which there seems to be no escape. Slideshow Poltergeist A splendid remake without depth of original Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon More about Poltergeist >> Whats more the screenplay - about a family that struggles to get their child back from a gaggle of very angry ghosts - is strong. The structure is sound the photography superb (especially in the 3D edition) and special effects solid. Its not exactly a scary film but it does provide an enjoyable ride. Its good fun. But it left me befuddled. A little sad. And a little angry. Why would anyone want to remake Poltergeist in the first place? It was hardly the most shocking film of its time but Tobe Hoopers Poltergeist remains one of Hollywoods most memorable and enduring ghost stories because it had that one thing missing from other genre films - poetry. Chalk it up to the influence of producer Steven Spielberg who reportedly butted heads with Hooper throughout the production. They may not have enjoyed each other but their conflict created a unique movie that was as much a classic fairy tale as it was a horror flick. Take the procession of ghosts near the third act. Against Jerry Goldsmiths music the specters each lit like an otherworldly firefly make their way down the staircase with a subtle majesty thats hard to forget. The reaction shots - JoBeth Williams weeping face Beatrice Straights wide-eyed epiphanous smile - bring the scene home. Take the shot of Williams as she describes how her daughters essence has just moved through her. There are no such moments in the remake. The original had a sense of fun thats also missing. Take the kitchen scene near the top of the first story. Dad (Craig T. Nelson) watches with awe and pleasure as the houses ghost power sends his kids sliding from one side of the room to the other. One nice touch completes the effect Both children are outfitted with football helmets. You know just in case. Even the ghosts in that film had character individuality personality. In the remake they are amorphous skeletal beings indistinguishable from one another. While its not exactly without heart and soul Kenans version doesnt go in for the little magical touches that fill the first. In one scene in the original the little boy (Oliver Robins) has a terrifying encounter with a ghost-possessed toy clown. There is a palpable sense of existential dread here. The new film streamlines the same scenes for maximum efficiency and effect. It squeezes out all the lyricism that made Poltergeist such a special treat.

Elements of the 1982 original already have been heavily pillaged by other movies so the shiny 2015 version winds up feeling like a third-rate ""Insidious"" or ""The Conjuring"" which already are second-rate riffs on themes found in ""Poltergeist.""Unfortunately thats not the only issue. Logic isnt always readily available here either.This movie offers the Bowen family with a laid-off dad (Sam Rockwell) and an unemployed mom (Rosemarie DeWitt). Somehow these two score a loan and buy a two-story fixer-upper in a neighborhood full of foreclosures.Almost immediately the familys youngest daughter (Kennedi Clements) is speaking to invisible people in her bedroom. Faster than you can say ""Theyre here"" the little girl is swallowed up by her closet and winds up in some netherworld between life and death.The Bowens live near a university with a paranormal-studies department -- doesnt everyone? Through the departments staff members they wind up with a TV ghost hunter named Carrigan Burke who comes in to help retrieve the girl. Jared Harris plays Burke; hes tattooed sports a jaunty porkpie hat and offers the only lively performance in the film.The movie employs some of the originals visual signatures such as nightmarish clown dolls kid-eating trees and corpses that pop out of the ground like jacks-in-the-box. Still nothing feels very menacing. Some of that is due to the adult actors sleepwalking through their parts -- Rockwell doesnt seem involved at all -- and Gil Kenans unimaginative direction.Kenan (he did the animated kid flick ""Monster House"") attempts to match the originals delicate mix of whimsy and horror. In the first film that was most likely due to the pairing of producer Steven Spielberg and scare-meister Tobe Hooper who directed. Here Kenan overdoes the silliness so theres never a sense of fear or genuine dread.The films momentum also is out of whack barreling through at a rapid pace. There is no time to know the characters before things start happening; then its suddenly over with an ending that lacks any kind of punch.Ultimately the whole affair is forgettable. The original film was promoted with the tagline ""It knows what scares you."" If there was a truth-in-advertising law regarding films this movies ad copy would read ""Poltergeist Meh.""Poltergeist2 stars (out of 5) Director Gil Kenan.Cast Sam Rockwell Rosemarie DeWitt Jared Harris Saxon Sharbino.Rating PG-13 for frightening sequences language and suggestive material.Reach the reporter at randy.cordovaarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8849.

Credit 20th Century Fox The new ""Poltergeist"" might well be the scariest movie 13-or-unders have yet seen just as the original was for their parents back in 1982. Those parents might find it an enjoyable trip down memory lane even if they do now recognize it as largely a well-served collection of horror-movie tropes.Gil Kenan directs the new incarnation which has lots of 21st-century updates and is available in a 3-D version that has some tasty flourishes. Being sucked into the netherworld looks even more convincing than it did back in the 80s.The story of course involves a family of five that moves into a house in a generic-looking development that was built where a cemetery once was and possibly still is. The screenplay by David Lindsay-Abaire (based on a story by Steven Spielberg) throws in a little modern-day economic gloom -- the neighborhood has been hit by foreclosures and the father in the family (Sam Rockwell) has recently been laid off. How a couple with no income gets bank approval to buy a house is a mystery thats not resolved but strange things happen in this part of town. Photo Sam Rockwell and Rosemarie DeWitt as Eric and Amy Bowen in ""Poltergeist."" Credit 20th Century Fox Mr. Rockwell provides welcome bits of comic relief and pairs nicely with Rosemarie DeWitt as the mother. The three children are especially well cast Saxon Sharbino as Kendra the teenage daughter; Kennedi Clements as the eerie little Madison a 6-year-old girl who talks to the ghosts through the television and closet door; and Kyle Catlett as Griffin who does fine work as the worlds biggest fraidy cat in a role that the remake gives extra significance.Yes the kids have been given trendier names (they were Dana Carol Anne and Robbie in 1982) because this is a decidedly 2015 ""Poltergeist"" in many ways. The pivotal television is a big ol flat screen and iPhones GPS devices and a drone camera come into play. Oh and who comes to the familys rescue? Carrigan Burke (Jared Harris) a guy with a ghost-hunter reality TV show.He and an investigator (Jane Adams) from a universitys paranormal investigations department have a little side plot going on that gives the movie an amusing kicker and all in all theres not much to complain about here except that -- as with a lot of revisited classics -- the storys not as revolutionary as you remember it. For veterans of the 1982 ""Poltergeist"" its more like scary but pleasant nostalgia. At an advance screening Thursday night touchstone sights -- those closet doors; that demented clown puppet -- drew sighs and scattered applause when they first appeared. Everyone remembers their first fright.

Now more than three decades on Sam Raimi whose Ghost House Pictures company produced this remake and director Gil Kenan (Monster House) have done the exact same thing. No really the 2015 Poltergeist is almost identical to the classic 1982 scare machine. Scary clown? Check. Scary tree? Check. Scary TV static? Checkity-check. Except lacking the shock of the new and the executing vision of the Spielberg-Hooper axis these frights are not frightening at all. Poltergeist does benefit from briskness--its actually 20 minutes shorter than Hoopers film--and there is a nice Evil Dead 2-esque sequence involving a power drill. The film also has a winning cast which includes Sam Rockwell and Rosemarie DeWitt as the tormented parents attempting to rescue their supernaturally-trapped youngest kid (Kennedi Clements) and Jared Harris whose rogue psychic investigator is one of the films few new-ish elements. But the only really frightening thing about the 2015 version of Poltergeist is how haunted it is by the original.

Its the same kind of thing with the same shape and some shared ingredients but the textures gone limp and theres no sense of occasion about it and theres some unpalatable goop stuffed in the crust. In a pinch it beats pizzalessness -- but just barely. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - The corporate strategy is straight-up remake In this new Poltergeist a family moves into a suburban development grooves to some supernatural oddities loses a kid inside a TV and then spends too many scenes hollering at lights in a closet. The storys been given a minor tech upgrade -- you know that drone the son gets as a random gift will pay off later -- but dont expect major surprises. Its not like they try to DVR the ghosts in the flatscreen or anything.Sometimes this Poltergeist plays like if Throwback Thursday were a movie. Many of the scares are the same which means fans of the original will likely be preoccupied comparing them The scary clown doll is now a full box of scary clown dolls which is remake-logic distilled to its essence. The body-horror sink grossout is dialed way back because a 15 PG-13 would run home bawling if it ever saw an 82 PG. The spirit-realm in the closet is here fully realized first as an Under the Skin-style void and later as marvelous corridor of bones and souls. And the killer tree? Thats a groaner on both sides of the millennium with computer effects somehow less persuasive than the practical work of 33 years ago. (In the pizza metaphor above CGI is the cheese in the crust.)Film Details Poltergeist RatingPG-13 GenreHorror Running Time93 min. More Info Trailer The filmmakers -- director Gil Kenan screenwriter David Lindsay-Abaire -- fare better with some new stuff especially a bit involving a grad student a drill and the closet of horrors. And they make a go of honoring the originals attention to suburban life as its actually lived. A fitful amusing Sam Rockwell plays the father an ex-jock who introduces himself to a realtor by announcing the job from which hes been laid off ""John Deere corporate"" he says unsure what he is now. The movie mostly avoids winking at us about Poltergeist history but his wife -- played with warm wit by Rosemarie DeWitt -- suggests he consider taking a job at the high school as a coach which must count as 2015s sneakiest Craig T. Nelson joke.DeWitts character is less well drawn Shes an author of some sort. But like Nelson and JoBeth Williams in the original she and Rockwell share a frisky vibrant connection. The movie peaks with Mom complaining about her worn-out undies and Dad hopeful she might take them off -- these two are so funny that its a shame the ghosts have to arrive.The early scenes have some old-fashioned snap and rigor to them with multiple ideas often communicated within a single shot. Kenan does good work establishing the layout of the home suggesting that somethings not quite right stirring that childhood sense that the mundane world has edged up against something darker. But the remake grows less interesting as it goes with final scares dipping into surprising lameness. I started checking my watch around the time Jared Harris turns up as a reality TV ghost-hunter. The good news Were spared parodic scenes of celeb ego and fraudery but those might have made more sense than the truncated arc hes given which builds to an act of muddled redemption. If this guy has been faking it on TV as the film alleges why is he the one who immediately groks the rules for this particular haunting?Eventually during one of those FX climaxes its easier for the mind to wait out than to assemble into meaning Harris chants some go-away-spirits boilerplate at the house. Its tepid and entirely unconnected to any particular strain of spiritualism and I couldnt believe it when the movie insisted that the poltergeist would stop to listen.Much more interesting is Jane Adams as an academic brought in to investigate the house and the inevitable missing child. The movie makes no time for her character but Adams crafts a memorable one anyway playing grave and perceptive and just a dot flighty all at once. She fully measures up to the Joyce Carol Oates glasses she wears in her final scene -- and if we must have a sequel doesnt that sound like the one to root for Joyce Carol Oates Ghost Stomper?One other thing this Poltergeist has in common with its predecessor Its not directed by Steven Spielberg. Yes his fingerprints and sensibility are all over Tobe Hoopers original which Spielberg produced and theyre here too especially when Close Encounters-style toys and iPads flicker to life in the middle of the night. That sequence with the camera roaming from master bedroom to the TV downstairs boasts a shivery wonder especially when the son a slip of a boy descends to the living room his silhouette a dead ringer for the skinny grays who took Richard Dreyfuss to the heavens. But that original Poltergeist is no more Spielbergs film than Raiders of the Lost Ark is Lucass. The best evidence is right there on the screen Steven Spielberg directing a story with a loving attentive constantly present father in it? Thats as crazy as expecting a horror remake that transcends its source -- or a well-pounded pie from a Pizza Hut.1 Sam Rockwell and Rosemarie DeWitt with Kennedi ClementsPhoto by Kerry Hayes/20th Century Fox Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Alan Scherstuhl Follow studiesincrap Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

Photo Twentieth Century Fox Call off the bomb threats. The newA PoltergeistA is not the raging hellfire of sacrilege many of us feared it might be. This reboot of Tobe Hooper and Steven Spielbergs 1982 horror classic seemed like a bad idea from the start. The original about a little girl sucked into a television set by ghosts from the beyond played on the weirdly unsettling phenomenon of TV white noise. To those of us who grew up in the age of the cathode ray that blast of blank sound and static overload felt like a time bomb waiting in the family boob tube. But its largely absent in todays HDTV world. Plus the earlier films greatness may even have been something of an accident -- a result of the fortuitous though at the time reportedly quite contentious conflict between Hoopers go-for-broke nihilism and Spielbergs paeans to suburbia. Besides if youre going to remakeA PoltergeistA without the whole TV angleA InsidiousA already kind of did that. To be fair this new Poltergeist isnt anything special either. But its not a travesty and that feels like cause for brief celebration. Director Gil Kenan (Monster House) and writer David Lindsay-Abaire (The Rise of the Guardians) invest the film with enough life to keep us interested. Theyre lucky of course to be working with Sam Rockwell and Rosemarie DeWitt playing Eric and Amy Bowen who with their three kids -- anxious Griffin (Kyle Catlett) impressionable Maddy (Kennedi Clements) and jaded teen Kendra (Saxon Sharbino) -- have just downsized to a neighborhood that like them is experiencing hard times. If the original Poltergeist was about the hustle and bustle of the modern American suburb in the 1980s -- with all its tribal rituals and petty grievances -- this new one plays off the desolation of that same suburb. Foreclosures have left the Bowens new neighborhood empty were told. Eric has just been laid off from his job at John Deere and Amy who had dreams of being a writer has her hands full with the kids. In other words the phantoms tormenting our protagonists this time around dont represent the underbelly of the American dream; instead theyre yet another indignity visited upon a dying middle class. Thats an interesting way to update the original film. (Though not particularly novel. The real-estate crash and the financial crisis have fueled an impressive number of horror movies it seems.)A Meanwhile Rockwell and DeWitt have fun with the scripts lively intrafamilial banter as they try to deal with Griffins paralyzing fears and Kendras constant complaining. It helps that the kids have each been given distinctive personalities all of which come into play when the fireworks start. Those fireworks come quickly as the film settles into a groove that borrows heavily from the original. The house exudes strange electrical portents. Griffin is tormented by a box filled with terrifying clown toys and a willow tree that hovers above his attic-room window. Then Maddy who had been having odd conversations with her closet and with the TV set is pulled into the wall and vanishes. Having witnessed this madness the Bowens turn to a paranormal researcher (Jane Adams) who with her team starts to record and analyze just what exactly is happening. To replace the role of the psychic from the earlier film this time we have Jared Harris playing a flamboyant reality-show host and looking like hes having the time of his life.A Alas were still supposed to be watching a horror movie and this new Poltergeist isnt particularly scary. When we do jump its usually because the film is replicating or revising a scare from the original film which is fun at first but loses its charm after the third or fourth time. The original Poltergeist worked in part because it brought a sense of wonder to the gritty world of horror. It was a landmark in fusing the genre with the eye-popping F/X work Spielbergs films had popularized -- E.T. meets The Amityville Horror. (Thats also why I think it pissed off some purists at the time -- it made the genre safe for kids.) Here the pyrotechnics are mostly functional and not particularly notable. Yes our new highly technologized world fits right into the Poltergeist narrative; this time instead of just the TV the technological gateways to the beyond are all around us. (When Maddy does do the iconic stare-at-the-TV-and-croak-""Theeyre heeere"" thing its mostly a passing nod.) The malevolent force fields surround our characters; tablets and cell phones go haywire and start acting like Geiger counters. Interesting perhaps ... but not interesting enough. This new Poltergeist may not be an embarrassment but that aforementioned wonder is gone this time out. What was once so distinctive now feels thoroughly boilerplate.

It doesnt reinvent the wheel but Poltergeist is a solid surprisingly effective chiller thats respectful towards its 1982 predecessor while acquitting itself as a proficient update. Sam Rockwell stars here as Eric Bowen a functioning alcoholic father whos lost his job and moves his wife Amy (Rosemarie DeWitt) and three kids into a new house so he can get a fresh start. As soon as they move in Erics youngest daughter Maddy makes a connection with a paranormal presence that seems friendly at first but of course turns out to be anything but. Director Gi Kenan (Monster House) and screenwriter David Lindsay-Abaire streamline the proceedings which makes for a an efficient lean story. The spooks start almost immediately so the movie loses the slow-burn anxiety that Tobe Hoopers original was rich with but is able to make it up in with savvy suspense sequences throughout. The completely unnecessary 3D adds nothing but Keenan is able to layer in frights organically while throwing in the occasional cheap jump-scare.

(Twentieth Century Fox/AP) IJared Harris as gifted medium Carrigan Burke leads the fight to retrieve a child from the world of the poltergeists in the film Poltergeist. (20th Century Fox/AP) Rockwell is engaging and his desperation to keep his family happy in the face of a rocky financial future make him compelling but when the ghosts start running amok he becomes curiously detached like the haunting is just an inconvenience to him. He and DeWitt share a charming chemistry however and the three kids are all perform adeptly. Kennedi Clements as the young Maddy in particular is strong throughout. Meanwhile Jared Harris (Mad Men) is a hoot as a realty show hosting ghost hunter who helps the Bowen family clean their house of its spirits.

Photo 2015 FOX/MGM MOVIE REVIEW Poltergeist Hauntingly familiar Running time 93 minutes. Rated PG-13 (profanity scary images child peril) ""Poltergeist"" is heaving with the scariest things you can possibly imagine The mad clown doll that comes alive. The undead seeking revenge. The bitchy teen girl. You can sense why the ghouls dont kidnap the high schooler. Who would want to spend eternity listening to her gripe about her broken smartphone? Building on the sacred bones of 1982s ""Poltergeist"" this serviceable remake sticks fairly closely and smartly to the same plot with the same scary objects and even the line ""Theyre here."" A young couple (Sam Rockwell Rosemarie DeWitt) with a bratty teen girl (Saxon Sharbino) boy (Kyle Catlett) and adorable 6-year-old girl (Kennedi Clements) loses the latter when the TV swallows her. Getting her back means hooking a rope to the wall stepping into Satans closet and trying to find the girl among the writhing dead whose spirits infest the house because it was built on a cemetery. It all comes at a 21st-century clip This is that rare movie thats actually too short. Youre barely halfway through your box of Jujubes before there are grasping corpses burbling out of the muck strangly clowns and a tree busting through the window. The remake improves on the original in a couple of respects The effects are much better of course -- theres a fantastically creepy interval set among rows of restless corpses underground -- and the script is lightly witty without resorting to cheap self-mockery of the ""we know were just characters in a movie"" variety that ruins so many horror movies. Much of the wit I suspect is down to the incomparable Rockwell who turns the usual false-alarm early scare into a laugh line He hurls himself against the walls a few times contorts his face in horror and announces ""We have a squirrel."" Theres also a fun idea in having the ghost hunter (Jared Harris) be the host of a cheesy reality show and the parapsychologist (Jane Adams) be his ex-wife. ""I have special powers"" he boasts. ""Youre not that special"" she replies. The move hints that its going to broaden the original movies reach from satirizing TV addiction to terror of anything with an off switch Theyre everywhere One thing that goes bump in the house is Moms shin after she walks into a box because shes looking at her iPad. But the movie directed by Gil Kenan (""Monster House"") feels like the studio cut it down to the bare minimum figuring that the horror-movie audience has no time for the kind of niceties that would have rounded things out. So the subtext gets tossed very little time is spent on establishing character bonds and the back story about the house being built on a cemetery is reduced from whole scenes to a couple of lines of dialogue. Maybe thats a good thing but its hard to explain why the film didnt reprise the thrilling moment when JoBeth Williams turned a rope into an artificial umbilical cord and went into the darkness to save her baby. Still theres plenty to rattle your cage here and just as the original was one of the scariest PG movies ever the reboot has about as much gruesomeness as you can possibly stuff into a PG-13. You know youve done your work as a horror movie when a viewer cheerfully calls out (as did someone in the audience at a Thursday night screening) ""Thats f--ed up"" Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Filed under movie reviews  sam rockwell Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next These are the 5 most cursed movies of all time Read Next These are the 5 most cursed movies of all time Most Popular This Week 1 Why Obamas half-brother says hell be voting for Donald Trump 2 The parents who didnt sue Disney taught America a powerful lesson 3 The most undervalued women in America are childless aunts 4 How Hillary blew her big moment 5 Clinton campaigns move to force Trump super-PAC ad off TV 6 Taking out a reverse mortgage ruined my life Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 39253 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 20278 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops 13983 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

But who asked em? On the long list of movies nobody needed to remake you could definitely place the 1982 ""Poltergeist."" It had cool characters a decent idea perfectly fine special effects and several quotable lines - all under the supervision of producer writer (and guiding force) Steven Spielberg. But someone had the rights and someone thought there was some more money in the idea (even after two pretty undead sequels and a spin-off TV series). And so dust off the nice suburban parents the cute little girl and the ectoplasm - the ghosts are here again. But although the spirits are willing the film is weak. Things get off to a good start mostly thanks to leads Sam Rockwell and Rosemarie DeWitt. Both actors always make any line believable and every character personal and if the moving-day opening starts things on a false note (who the heck gave a mortgage to two unemployed people with lousy credit?) theyre fun to watch. The movie also nicely updates the haunting of the first film letting the monsters live not only in the TV but move through the houses wiring jumping from outlet to outlet. Theres also a never-developed hint (or is that merely hopeful foreshadowing for a sequel?) that nearby power lines are playing a part too. Other elements feel dragged in though like a completely cliched and arbitrary box of spooky clown dolls a previous owner left behind. Or a toy drone that seems to be here chiefly so the film can say - hey look weve got a toy drone here Director Gil Kenan (who did the fun cartoon ""Monster House"" and the not-fun YA picture ""City of Ember"") handles the shocks adequately and screenwriter David Lindsay-Abaire (who alternates between bad kids movies like ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" and great dramas like ""Rabbit Hole"") has given his actors some good dialogue. But the film doesnt give them enough room. This remake is over 20 minutes shorter than the original ""Poltergeist"" and it saved most of that time by sacrificing the beginning and end. We need to get to know these characters first (the way the first film poked fun at the fathers dadbod or showed the moms initial geeky delight at the supernatural goings-on). We definitely want a big deluxe spook show at the end (like that first movies swimming pool full of exploding caskets and the imploding house). This version seems to be in such a hurry to be over it doesnt give us either. Perhaps it did once. The film started shooting back in September of 2013; its release date has bumped around a bit and the effects look cheap and rushed. All in all it has the feeling of a movie someone had second thoughts about and maybe fiddled with a bit in the ending room. (Of course - like all red-headed stepfilms - it sneaked into theaters without screening for critics.) We know its a movie about dead things. But it seems like somebody wrote its eulogy months ago. Ratings note The film contains violence sexual material and some strong language. Poltergeist (PG-13) Fox (93 min.) (PG-13) Fox (93 min.) Directed by Gil Kenan. With Sam Rockwell Rosemarie DeWitt.

"Poltergeist remake haunted by far better and scarier original | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesPoltergeist remake haunted by far better and scarier originalRemake of 1982 classic Poltergeist starring Sam Rockwell and Rosemarie DeWitt cant fill the sizable shoes of one of the scariest horror movies ever made.Madison Bowen played by Kennedi Clements gets pulled to the spirit realm through a TV set just like in the original Poltergeist but this time its a flat-screen model.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. May 21 2015PoltergeistStarring Sam Rockwell Rosemarie DeWitt Kennedi Clements Jared Harris and Kyle Catlett. Directed by Gil Kenan. 93 minutes. Opening Friday at major theatres. 14AIf not for the talents of Sam Rockwell and Rosemary DeWitt Gil Kenans 2015 retooling of 1982 paranormal thriller Poltergeist wouldnt stand a ghost of a chance.As laid-back recently downsized dad Eric Bowen and frustrated writer-wife Amy Bowen theyre credible and often effortlessly funny as a couple reluctantly relocating to cost-saving suburbia with Hamilton standing in for middle America.Article Continued BelowThey have three kids in tow sullen teen Kendra (Saxon Sharbino) nervous middle boy Griffin (Kyle Catlett) and cutie pie Maddie (Kennedi Clements) the 6-year-old who is soon kidnapped by vengeful dead people who drag her to the ""other side"" via the TV set to right a buried wrong.With a whole world of technology birthed since the infinitely better -- and far scarier -- 1982 original a tech update would seem the only logical reason for a reboot.But the kid is still trapped in the tube just like 30 years ago. OK so its a flat-screen but this is progress?Steven Spielbergs original story isnt much changed as the family moves in and finds increasingly strange goings-on in their home.In some cases the dialogue is the same although the delivery is picked up to match the quickened pace of the remake which rushes to get everything into 93 minutes.There are some jumps but few legitimate scares unlike director Tobe Hoopers original which although similarly bloodless still stands as one of the scariest movies ever made. The Bowens approach paranormal expert Brooke Powell (Jane Adams) and her team for help. She brings in a bigger gun with reality show ghostbuster Carrigan Burke a medium with a message. He signs off each show with ""this house is clean"" making us miss helium-voiced actress Zelda Rubinstein as spirit tamer Tangina Barrons.In fact we miss a lot in Kenans version disappointed that the director behind the 2006 animation Monster House wouldnt have a better handle on telling a haunting tale.The spirits may have been willing with Poltergeist but the movie is weak.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

This new spooky-house chiller never escapes the shadow of its predecessor but it also pales next to the scores of subsequent movies -- ""The Conjuring"" ""Insidious"" and ""Paranormal Activity"" to name just a few -- that have already stripped the original ""Poltergeist"" for parts. Even if the results are forgettable producer Sam Raimi has if nothing else assembled an impressive team. Director Gil Kenan made his directorial debut with the effective (and genre-adjacent) animated film ""Monster House"" playwright David Lindsay-Abaire (""Rabbit Hole"") handles script duty and casting directors Scot Boland and Victoria Burrows have put together a capable ensemble from established players like Rosemarie DeWitt and Sam Rockwell as the put-upon homeowners to young Kyle Catlett as their son. (Catlett not only registers genuine fear and anxiety throughout but he also looks like he could really be DeWitts child.) See Video Theyre Heeeeere In Sam Raimis Newest Poltergeist Trailer (Video) Unfortunately the wrong moves outnumber the right ones and the attempts that this ""Poltergeist"" makes to stand on its own merely underscore what the original film did so brilliantly. Whereas the first movie for example shocked audiences by setting a haunted-house movie in an otherwise ordinary and normal-seeming suburb this one lets us know right away that somethings amiss from the giant power lines nearby to the bones barely buried in the yard to the box of clown dolls in the attic. Yes. A box of clown dolls. As though a discovery like that wouldnt make a new tenant immediately run screaming. Also Read Ash Vs. Evil Dead Poster and Teaser Trailer Released by Starz (Video) Anyway its just the second night that Eric (Rockwell) and Amy Bowen (DeWitt) spend in their new house before youngest daughter Madison (Kennedi Clements) gets snatched up by the restless souls in the closet and its only with the help of paranormal expert Claire (Jane Adams) and basic-cable ghostbuster Carrigan Burke (Jared Harris) that the Bowens can get their little girl back. The films most effective scene is also the one that shows us the least Claires skeptical assistant Boyd (Nicholas Braun ""Date and Switch"") has a creepy encounter involving an electric drill and an unseen entity on the other side of the wall. This is one of the few moments that Kenan and Lindsay-Abaire let us use our imagination; taking us into the parallel dimension of the ghostly departed isnt nearly as terrifying as the suggestion of same that the original movie offered and since were operating in the realm of PG-13 horror here the gore is mild and the jolts are almost all of the jump-scare variety. Given how little they have to work with DeWitt and Rockwell -- and even Adams and Harris to a lesser extent -- do what they can to inject recognizability into the sketchiest of stock characters and Catlett Clements and Saxon Sharbino (""Touch"") as the three Bowen children create a significant amount of empathy; their reactions to the horrors taking place around them are often more effectively portrayed than the horrors themselves. Also Read Lucy Lawless Joins Cast of Starz Evil Dead TV Adaption ""Poltergeist"" ultimately plays like the most perfunctory of remakes one born of rights ownership and title marketability rather than a burning desire on anyones part to do something interesting or provocative with a classic. The 1982 original remains unassailable all the more so when stood side by side with its pipsqueak descendant. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Its infrequent and particularly satisfying when the remake of an especially memorable film equals or exceeds the experience of the original. In 1982 Poltergeist saw the brilliant pairing of The Texas Chainsaw Massacres low-budget horror director Tobe Hooper with far more mainstream screenwriter and producer Steven Spielberg for an effects-laden event movie that earned its place as a contemporary benchmark among supernatural thrillers. Leaving behind the youth-skewing perspectives of Monster House and City of Ember director Gil Kenan not only delivers on the promise of Hoopers Poltergeist but significantly raises the stakes for similar PG-13 fare. With strong brand identity and two generations of moviegoers to cultivate MGM and Foxs Memorial Day weekend release should help boost the summer box office to a promising start with a solid opening frame although prospects for franchise-building (the original was followed by two sequels) look somewhat mixed. In setting the scene Kenan and the filmmakers take their cue from the first film in the trilogy as Eric Bowen (Sam Rockwell) and his wife Amy (Rosemarie DeWitt) crippled by the financial impacts of the Great Recession look to downsize so that they can continue adequately providing for their three kids. They find what theyre looking for in a distressed but affordable home for sale thats located in a nondescript development full of vacant properties on the outskirts of an Illinois town where Amy attended university. Youngest daughter Maddy (Kennedi Clements) is excited to move in following the initial tour after conversing with some new invisible friends who speak to her from a mysterious bedroom closet. Anxiety-prone middle child Griffin (Kyle Catlett) isnt thrilled to be settling into an attic bedroom however where an ominous willow tree looms over the house through a rooftop skylight. Teenage Kendra (Saxon Sharbino) displays visible disaffection with her new situation preferring to remain in touch with her old life and friends via phone text and video chat. On the first night in their new home while everyone else is asleep Griffin discovers Maddy talking to the big-screen living room TV as it flashes and emits strange noises. ""Theyre here"" she says referring to her friends ""the lost people."" Now Griffin has some solid reasons to feel worried especially after noticing objects moving around the house of their own accord and discovering a box full of scary clown dolls stashed in a storage space. His parents just attribute these trepidations to his chronic anxiety and it isnt until the next night when theyre out to dinner at a neighbors house that they discover some disturbing information regarding their new home that sends them rushing back to check on the kids. See more 30 of 2015s Most Anticipated Movies Star Wars Tomorrowland Furious 7 Joy and More (Photos) By the time they arrive Griffin and Kendra have suffered supernatural attacks and Maddy has vanished completely. At their wits end Amy and Eric decide to seek guidance from Dr. Claire Powell (Jane Adams) from the Department of Paranormal Research at Amys former university. Powell agrees to assist bringing in her staff to wire the Bowens home with video cameras and monitoring equipment in their search for the missing child. They soon determine that Maddy is able to speak to them through the TV set but cant provide any clues to her whereabouts. Powell concludes that the house is under the influence of a malevolent poltergeist that has abducted Maddy holding her in a shadowy in-between realm that they will have to access in order to rescue her before she disappears completely. As the film reaches its midpoint all of the essential elements of the original are in place and in part this satisfying continuity is attributable to a screen story again written by Spielberg. In scripting the remake David Lindsay-Abaire hews closely to the earlier template replicating some key scenes with more contemporary flair while ratcheting up the pacing by cutting 20 minutes off the running time. Updating the spiritual medium character with hardbitten reality TV host Carrigan Burke (Jared Harris) an Indiana Jones-style ghostbuster provides a recognizable pop-culture reference blowing away the musty cobwebs of stereotypically aloof psychics. Read more Star Wars The Force Awakens Named Fandangos Most Anticipated Movie of 2015 Although Rockwell appears capable of holding the Bowens together in the face of financial and personal peril its a rather under-written part that lacks the frequent character tics hes exploited more memorably in smaller-scale films. DeWitt is the predictably supportive emotional core of the family eventually driven to extremes by her daughters predicament. In a substantial role for a young actor Catlett favorably impresses with his comprehensive grasp of Griffins neuroses and his determination to face them head-on in several pivotal scenes. The integration of notably naturalistic visual effects with the digital filmmaking is frequently almost seamless until the setting shifts into an entirely supernatural realm during the final attempt to retrieve Maddy. Kenans overall improvements to the movies visual style arent only attributable to advances in technology and a 3D update however. While Hooper favored shock value and jump scares Kenan and cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe construct far more fluid sequences as the camera glides and hovers over its subjects reserving the most impactful shots for a concluding sequence thats particularly thrilling.

The cast are terrific Sam Rockwell and Rosemarie DeWitt play the hapless parents whose bargain dream-home turns out to be a haunted death-trap with strong support from their onscreen offspring especially Kyle Catlett as nervy middle child Griffin. Director Gil Kenan has a solid track record - his 2006 debut Monster House remains a sorely underrated slice of 80s throwback kiddie horror - and producer Sam Raimis fright-flick credentials are of course unimpeachable. So its disappointing to report that Poltergeist while entertaining has more in common with slick audience-goosing twenty-first-century spookers like Insidious and Sinister than with Hoopers imaginative original. The characters may be new and the effects more sophisticated (though far less inventive) but the plot remains essentially unchanged. When their five-year-old daughter (Kennedi Clements) is sucked into the supernatural realm by unquiet spirits Rockwell and DeWitt turn to a team of paranormal investigators to get her back. A series of superb mid-film set-pieces - a creepy tree springing to ankle-grabbing life some nasty business with a power drill - set a high bar but Kenan cant sustain the tension. And when the original movies bellowing dwarf medium is replaced by Jared Harriss smirking Irish TV psychic the film takes a turn for the tacky eschewing Hoopers surrealist blowout in favour of pointless overexplanation and a feeble climax.

The closing credits for Gil Kenans remake of the 1982 horror classic ""Poltergeist"" feature the band Spoon covering the Cramps 1980 punk classic ""TV Set."" Spoon is a tasteful studious yet largely anodyne indie rock outfit that has become an NPR staple; the Cramps were a scuzzy unhinged psychobilly band whose most famous gig took place in an actual mental hospital. Its hard to think of a more fitting postscript for this professionally executed yet bloodless film itself an act of homage that hews reverently to its source material while missing the essential spirit and vitality that once powered it. Generally entertaining yet fundamentally unnecessary this tribute-band take on one of the genres greatest hits should score decent opening weekend numbers before finding its way into the light. In addition to being one of the most unsettling PG-rated films ever made the original ""Poltergeist"" -- directed by Tobe Hooper with not-insignificant input from producer-scripter Steven Spielberg -- touched a particularly sensitive nerve thanks to its grasp on the early Reagan era zeitgeist. Steeped in the consumer comforts of the upwardly mobile middle class the film ingeniously turned its most innocuous status symbols -- the brand-name appliances the cookie-cutter planned communities built on seemingly virgin territory the comforting hum of static coming from TV sets in every room -- into nexuses of terror. Now three decades later Kenan and scripter David Lindsay-Abaire have made efforts to contemporize the storys framework but these new touches never dig anywhere near as deep. Rather than a successful real estate agent for example paterfamilias Eric (Sam Rockwell) has recently been laid off from his job; his wife Amy (Rosemarie DeWitt) is no longer simply a homemaker but rather an unsuccessful writer who effectively functions as a homemaker. Faced with financial pressures the two have moved their three children to an idyllic yet permanently overcast suburban community. (Why they would choose the precise moment when theyre both unemployed to buy a new four-bedroom house is a question for another day.) These kids include bratty teenager Kendra (Saxon Sharbino) cherubic 6-year-old Madison (Kennedi Clements) and middle child Griffin (Kyle Catlett) who is afflicted with a level of anxiety befitting an early Woody Allen character and is the first to notice strange ghostly phenomena in their new abode. As one would expect all three youngsters are chained to their phones tablets and remote-controlled drones which are employed to mildly novel use throughout. Yet the film is most thoroughly modern not in its embrace of technology but in its rush to accommodate compressed attention spans. Substantially shorter than its predecessor the new ""Poltergeist"" has hardly even established its characters names before the kids are already being attacked by demonic clown dolls and reanimated corpses and Madison magnetically drawn to a malfunctioning TV set is quickly abducted by the houses malevolent spirits. From here Kenan mimics the story beats of the original almost exactly as the family turns first to a paranormal academic (Jane Adams) and later to a flamboyant medium (Jared Harris) to try to rescue their little one. Less a steadily escalating thriller than a guided tour through a county-fair-style haunted house ""Poltergeist"" offers some quality jump scares and Kenan has a knack for staging solid individual setpieces. But he proves weirdly incapable of modulation or mood setting here stringing together loud noises and ""right behind you"" jolts without much regard for pacing or buildup. His directorial debut ""Monster House"" actually offered a far more clever take on traditional haunting tropes as well as an obvious model for the character of Griffin whose role here has been greatly expanded from his counterpart in the original. The cast largely acquit themselves well even when deprived of much opportunity to really develop their characters. As he did in last years ""Laggies"" Rockwell plays the slightly boozy goofy father figure with great charm and likability and Catlett makes for a believably wise harried tyke of the Haley Joel Osment mold. DeWitt is unfortunately rather ill served by the films most significant divergence from the original which robs the character of her great moment of maternal heroism. Harris taking over for Zelda Rubinstein has fun channeling another vintage Spielberg production ""Jaws"" as a rough scarred Quint-essential spook-hunter. Visually speaking Javier Aguirresarobes photography is solid -- and while generally unnecessary the 3D work sometimes adds an extra layer of claustrophobia to the creeping interior shots -- yet the films attempts to illustrate the spirit world bring to mind Nine Inch Nails videos more readily than any otherworldly chthonian purgatory. Composer Marc Streitenfeld turns in a largely effective score though it cant help but pale in comparison to Jerry Goldsmiths Oscar-nominated original. Indeed even when one is inclined to admire the cleverness with which the remake revisits and reincorporates ""Poltergeists"" themes its hard to pinpoint a single moment where it improves on them and the aura of inessentiality hangs thick over the proceedings. Some franchises die but they dont know theyre gone. And then some franchises just get lost on their way to the reboot.

Some franchises die but they dont know theyre gone. And then some franchises just get lost on their way to the reboot. -From the Variety review by Andrew Barker This isnt a huge shock but we are kind of dissappointed... we really needed a good scream or two in the movie theater (It Follows literally only played in town one weekend at a venue that is now a huge pain in the ass to get anywhere near thanks to traffic revisions) but this doesnt look like it will fit the bill. Despite the fact this review compares the movie to a guided tour through a county-fair-style haunted house and states it has some quality jump scares nothing in this review-and the others weve read-makes us feel like seeing it in the theater rather than waiting for VOD/Blu-ray. OK if someone sent a car and driver to pick us up and the movie was free wed go. However reviews for Poltergeist 2015 tend to start waxing sentimental about the original and saying though the movie tries to recapture the magic and mood Tobe Hooper was able to craft perfectly in 1982 the bottom line is that this reboot was unnecessary horror remake for a beloved fan-favorite movie that did just fine (well much better than fine) the first time around. Oh and from what Ive heard there isnt even really a tip of the hat to the scene in the original where a member of the first group of paranormalists studying the ghostly activity hallucinates clawing his own face off (which they could never ever get away with putting in a PG-rated movie these days; in fact it was borderline R-rated) I am not saying they had to duplicate it but give us something other than the clown doll the tree and ""Theyre here/This house is clean"" for Chrissake Check out this piece we wrote when the first trailers of the movie went online for more including the actual gory scene (we recalled adults in the audience yelling ""HOAH"" in horrified surprise even louder than the kids our age). Reply Andy says May 23 2015 at 628 pm Barry Sandrew founder of Legend 3D Conversion House says yesterday on LinkedIn much like Gravity Poltergeist 2015 must been seen in 3D to experience it properly. If you have ever watched Gravity in 2D you know how dry and hard to watch the film is. Sounds like this film better add a 4K and HDR version to boost its OTT popularity. Reply Frederick Louis Richardson says May 21 2015 at 1013 am A reboot is exploitation of a brand. Content is incidental; improvement a miracle. If the remake is some how better great. Profit by investing in a named brand is the singular objective banking on nostalgia and ignorance. Sequels prequels and spinoffs for the most part rely on this formula. Because a new movie with a brand name often works its become an industry staple. More to come. Reply mistressthing69 says May 24 2015 at 614 am Youre so right unfortunately and the American public is dumbed down enough to fall for it.. Reply Omarsa says May 21 2015 at 455 am Is there anything sexual thing or kissing in the movie?? Reply Rex says May 25 2015 at 959 am No just much more acceptable and realistic stuff like demon spirits haunted toys disinterred corpses . . . Reply John Miller says May 19 2015 at 452 pm 1982 was the year that Spielberg stopped being an artist and started just being a producer of movie product. ""Poltergeist"" was just a B-movie set of cheap scares and Spielberg showing how he could put anything into a PG movie and the MPAA would be too gutless to do anything about it. Goldsmiths score is the one and only thing that was remotely worthwhile about it. Reply John Miller says May 31 2015 at 113 am Now that all of you are done getting each other off you can go back to muttering to yourselves in your little corners. Reply Emmanuel Williams says May 21 2015 at 538 pm ""A B-movie set of cheap scares?"" Tell me John. Why is it that the 1982 Poltergeist is hailed as one of the greatest haunted house movies ever made? On Bravo 100 Scariest Movies? And a major success in 1982 during its original release? Spielberg. As well as Tobe Hooper. And Jerry Goldsmith made the modern day haunted house classic. Many horror fans and movie critics will agree with me. Reply Cindylover1969 says May 20 2015 at 1202 am I wasnt aware ""The Color Purple"" ""Empire Of The Sun"" ""Schindlers List"" ""Amistad"" ""Saving Private Ryan"" ""Minority Report"" ""Catch Me If You Can"" ""Lincoln"" and the sorely underrated ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence"" were all made before 1982. Congratulations on invalidating your post in the very first sentence. Reply Daniels says May 20 2015 at 1036 am Thank you Ectoplasmic says May 19 2015 at 1233 pm I caught the original POLTERGEIST on its opening night back in June 1982; it was fun and fairly gripping -- but that dumb tree coming to life and grabbing the boy through the window was a tad ridiculous. Despite that and sundry plot holes throughout its held up as a spooky timewaster on tv. And its on tv a LOT. The trailers for this new version have hardly whetted my appetite...it looks like every other haunted house flick thats come along the last few years; they remind me of a revved up PARANORMAL ACTIVITY (the decidedly low-tech first film in the series remains something of a creepy stunner). Ill be giving P-Redux one a big miss at the cinemas...but I may catch it on VOD or on disc in a few months if just to see if theyd gotten rid of that tree Reply Bill B. says May 19 2015 at 1228 pm They would have to pay me to see this and since they wont I will never be seeing it. Reply mistressthing69 says May 24 2015 at 616 am ME TOO Reply Meredith Basinger says May 19 2015 at 1020 am Ps. Perhaps they should focus on ""original"" stories rather than re-hashing classics. It rarely works the 2nd time anyway and yet the studios keep trying. There are probably amazingly creative scripts amp; stories out there just waiting to be produced;) Reply mistressthing69 says May 24 2015 at 618 am I couldnt have written it better myself Meredith. Spot-on Reply Meredith Basinger says May 19 2015 at 1014 am Great review Its sad that they missed the essence.of the original. Perhaps it speaks to the mindset of most people today..and the studio system. Rushing to entertain without much substance rather than entice and lead people into a story that moves them. Reply Paul Brno says May 19 2015 at 941 am Woody Allen is like a POLTERGEIST in real life. Creepy is his middle name.He is suspicious of everyone. And he brainwashed Diane Keaton into becoming just like him amp; becoming suspicious of everyone also. I went to the Neighborhood Playhouse for two years with her amp; I used to take her to the movies amp; we were in summer stock together amp; when I saw her at Tavern on the Green in 2008 she acted like I was a stranger. Horrible. Diane amp; Woody are horrible. Reply Rex says May 25 2015 at 1003 am Funniest comment on this review Even funnier if you read it out loud in a Woody Allen voice. ) Reply downhillrun2000 says May 19 2015 at 904 am ""middle child Griffin who is afflicted with a level of anxiety befitting an early Woody Allen character"" If she is a preteen maybe it is Woody Allen who is causing her anxiety. Reply Marco says May 21 2015 at 418 am HIM. Its a boy. Reply yirmin snipe says May 19 2015 at 830 am You know the fatal flaw that really kills it for me is when you see the little girl redoing the original static on a TV screen scene... It worked in the original because there was such a thing as static on a TV screen.... But with digital TVs there are never any static screens... When the signal goes the screen goes black... at best you get blocky pictures but never static... Oh well I guess they couldnt come up with new gimmick to use so they had someone create static on a screen that will be alien to younger viewers that have probably never seen the old style TV sets. Reply Paul C says May 23 2015 at 1026 pm They are modern flat screens and they do go both black and blocky before something uses it to try to communicate from the other side which is where they pay homage to the original static. Reply Ian Westcott says May 19 2015 at 1209 pm On my Samsung TV if its switched to a TV tuner channel (the TV tuner has nothing hooked up to it since the Tivo normally connects to something different) it switches to static and stays on it. Reply josh says May 19 2015 at 1015 am Shes a he...Its Bryan Singer he needs to watch out for. Reply enrgodinez says May 19 2015 at 940 am Teens around 1516 have probably seen older tv sets maybe even some children not all of them are as ignorant with older electronics. Reply Enrique says May 19 2015 at 936 am Why do you need to call it ""gimmick"" how was the original tv static thing a ""gimmick""? Reply Jake says May 19 2015 at 804 am I was very afraid of this remake because the original is so good -- but you are basically saying its not too bad Reply Leon says May 19 2015 at 701 am Looked terrible. Now I know it is. Leave classics alone. Reply dmoney666 says May 19 2015 at 620 am This is a perfect example of when people should back off a remake. Leave the classics ALONE. Rarely if ever (feel free to point out an exception) are these re-makes worth seeing because they cant hold a candle to the magic of the original. Kudos to them for getting paid to do this though. Reply Ian Westcott says May 19 2015 at 1212 pm For a remake to really work the original should have been a good idea that was yet a missed opportunity. Remaking a well-regarded classic without radically changing it breaks what should be regarded as a rule. The Psycho remake didnt work. It faithfully executed the original but that leaves it as a lesser copy. I dont see how Poltergeist could have ended up any different. Reply Kenny Powers (OrangeBlackTeal) says September 20 2015 at 1016 pm Invasion of the Body Snatchers with Donald Sutherland was better than the original.
